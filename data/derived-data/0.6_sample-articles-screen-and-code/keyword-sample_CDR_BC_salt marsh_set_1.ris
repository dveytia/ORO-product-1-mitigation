TI  - Seawall-induced impacts on large river delta wetlands and blue carbon storage under sea level rise
AB  - Coastal wetlands have been enclosed by thousands of kilometers of seawalls in China to obtain extra land for rapid socio-economic development in the coastal region. Although understanding seawall-induced impacts on delta wetlands and their ecosystem can provide valuable decision-making information to support coastal management, quantifying and measuring long-term, cumulative ecological impacts of harden seawall under sea level rise (SLR) remains a vital research gap. In this study, by combining the land-use transformation trajectory analysis, ecosystem services assessment, and the SLAMM (Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model), we have explored the seawall-induced effects on temporal-spatial dynamics of tidal wetlands and the Coastal Blue Carbon storage (CBCs) in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) under the SLR by 2050 and 2100. Our study revealed that the delta wetland area would have increased by 2327.87 km2 after seawall removal without regard for SLR while increasing by 3050 km2 in 2100 in both seawall scenarios under SLR. The effects of driving processes trajectory on the changes in CBCs indicated two-sided seawall-induced impacts on the delta wetlands in the YRD, i.e., functioning as a physical coastal defense to prevent coastal erosion (before 2050) while intensifying coastal squeeze effects and quickening the loss in delta wetlands and the CBCs by hindering their inland migration under SLR. For example, the gap of CBCs between the seawall-impacting and seawall-removal scenarios would have reached at 9.94 Ã— 106 Mg by 2050 under the SLR, and the magnitude of the final decrease effect on CBCs induced by the seawall-impacting would be nearly 5 times higher than its gain after seawall-removal in the regressive succession, while the same magnitudes in the salinization process on both scenarios. Our study has provided valuable insights for shoreline management by mitigating seawall-induced impacts on the delta wetlands and their ecosystem services such as CBCs. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Blue carbon storage comparing mangroves with saltmarsh and seagrass habitats at a warm temperate continental limit
AB  - In South Africa, blue forests occur in sheltered estuaries where little is known about their carbon storage. This study was the first to quantify the carbon storage of blue forests at a warm temperate estuary in the Eastern Cape, the southern distributional limit for mangroves in Africa. Results showed that soil organic carbon was significantly higher in mangroves (228.08 Â± 27.99 Mg C/ha) compared with saltmarshes (2.61 Â± 0.19 Mg C/ha) and seagrasses (1.67 Â± 0.81 Mg C/ha). However, these values were less than the reported global means for blue carbon because of slower growth and productivity at latitudinal limits for mangroves, a drier climate, and coarse-grained soil. Even though carbon storage was limited, this chapter provides baseline data for South Africaâ€™s estuaries to partake in potential carbon credit trading schemes which will aid with the management and protection of mangrove habitats in future.

TI  - The role of biogenic structures for greenhouse gas balance in vegetated intertidal wetlands
AB  - This chapter elucidates in detail the current knowledge on the role of biogenic structures for greenhouse gas biogeochemistry and dynamics in vegetated intertidal wetlands, i.e., mangrove forests and saltmarshes. The major types of biogenic structures formed by wetland plants and animals are portrayed and related to relevant biogeochemical processes affecting greenhouse gases. Subsequently, the impact of biogenic structures for greenhouse gas exchange is demonstrated by assessing and compiling the current knowledge on net primary production, carbon sequestration, and greenhouse gas emissions in mangrove forests and Spartina marshes. The data compilation clearly emphasizes the important role of biogenic structures (i.e., plant roots and infaunal burrows/tubes) for carbon cycling and greenhouse gas dynamics of intertidal wetlands. Emission of the greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, and N2O in mangrove forests with biogenic structures is increased 4.8, 29.9, and 3.8 times, respectively, compared with mangrove sediments devoid of these structures. Due to lack of reliable data on the role of burrow structures on greenhouse gas emission in Spartina marshes, only the impact of vegetation is available resulting in an increase of 2.7, 3.3, and 9.1 times, respectively. The strong enhancement of greenhouse gas emissions via biogenic structures largely counteracts the otherwise efficient capacity of carbon sequestration by these vegetated wetlands, leading to climate neutrality when embracing the global warming potential of the involved gases. This finding is surprising and contradicts previous estimates that indicated a distinct climate mitigation potential of mangrove and saltmarsh ecosystems. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Vertical intertidal variation of organic matter stocks and patterns of sediment deposition in a mesotidal coastal wetland
AB  - Tidal coastal wetlands, common home to seagrass and salt marshes, are relevant carbon sinks due to their high capacity to accumulate and store organic carbon in their sediments. Recent studies demonstrated that the spatial variability of this organic carbon within the same wetland system can be significant. Some of the environmental drivers of this spatial variability remain understudied and the selection of the most relevant ones can be context dependent. Here we investigated the role of bed elevation, hydrodynamics, and habitat type (salt marsh and seagrass) on the organic matter (OM) net deposition-resuspension rate and superficial sedimentary stocks (top 5 cm) at the tidal wetlands of the Ria Formosa, a mesotidal coastal lagoon in South Portugal. Results showed that two vectors of spatial variation need to be considered to describe the intertidal sedimentary OM stocks: the bed elevation that imposes a decrease of the hydroperiod and thus the change of habitat from the lower seagrass Z. noltei to the upper saltmarsh S. maritimus, and the horizontal spatial variation along the secondary channels of the lagoon that imposes a decrease in the current flow velocity magnitude. The multiple linear regression analyses, using data from 40 sampling points, explained 59% of the variation of the superficial sedimentary stocks of OM in salt marshes and seagrasses of the Ria Formosa lagoon and revealed that stocks generally decrease with elevation, yet with variation among sites and habitats. It was also found that the decrease of the OM net deposition-resuspension rate with bed elevation was exponential. Our study emphasizes the importance of considering multiple environmental drivers and spatial variation for regional estimations of organic matter (and organic carbon) sedimentary stocks in coastal wetlands.

TI  - Soil Organic Carbon Storage Changes in Coastal Wetlands of the Liaohe Delta, China, Based on Landscape Patterns
AB  - Growing wetland loss along a coastal area in China was examined through shoreline recession and land use changes. Carbon storage or sequestration in coastal wetland soils was based on vertical marsh accretion and aerial change data. Marshes sequester significant amounts of carbon through vertical accretion; however, large amounts of carbon previously sequestered in the soil profile are lost through rapid land use changes and shoreline recessions. The Liaohe Delta (LHD) was divided into nine landscape types based on Landsat TM digital images from 1991 to 2011. The distributed areas and transfer matrices of each landscape type were calculated. Combined with the organic carbon content and bulk density of 202 soil surface samples from field investigations in 2012, the soil organic carbon pools and stocks were estimated. Results showed that the soil organic carbon pools varied from 0.58 to 9.75 kg m(-2), and organic carbon storage in the upper 20 cm of soil was 1935.92 x 10(4) and 1863.87 x 10(4) t in 1991 and 2011, respectively. We attributed these large losses of carbon to rapid land use changes. The construction of levees along the shoreline has triggered large instantaneous losses of previously sequestered carbon through the destruction of 278.06 km(2) of tidal flats. Our results reveal that the LHD wetlands might not serve as a desired sink of carbon if maladministration practices are applied. These results can provide scientific guidance for decision makers in determining an effective way to maintain the soil carbon pool in the wetlands of the LHD.

TI  - Response of gaseous carbon emissions to low-level salinity increase in tidal marsh ecosystem of the Min River estuary, southeastern China
AB  - Although estuarine tidal marshes are important contributors to the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the relationship between carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) emission, and environmental factors, with respect to estuarine marshes, has not been clarified thoroughly. This study investigated the crucial factors controlling the emission of CO2 and CH4 from a freshwater marsh and a brackish marsh located in a subtropical estuary in southeastern China, as well as their magnitude. The duration of the study period was November 2013 to October 2014. Relevant to both the field and incubation experiments, the CO2 and CH4 emissions from the two marshes showed pronounced seasonal variations. The CO2 and CH4 emissions from both marshes demonstrated significant positive correlations with the air/soil temperature (p < 0.01), but negative correlations with the soil electrical conductivity and the pore water/tide water Cl- and SO42- (p < 0.01). The results indicate no significant difference in the CO2 emissions between the freshwater and brackish marshes in the subtropical estuary, whereas there was a difference in the CH4 emissions between the two sites (p < 0.01). Although future sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion could reduce the CH4 emissions from the estuarine freshwater marshes, these factors had little effect on the CO2 emissions with respect to an increase in salinity of less than 5\%. The findings of this study could have important implications for estimating the global warming contributions of estuarine marshes along differing salinity gradients.

TI  - Uptake of organic nitrogen by coastal wetland plants under elevated CO2
AB  - Aims This study was conducted to answer the question of whether elevated CO2 and the presence or absence of inorganic nitrogen (NH4+) affect the uptake of different forms of organic nitrogen in two dominant saltmarsh species Schoenoplectus americanus and Spartina patens. Methods S. americanus and S. patens were grown under elevated and ambient CO2 conditions and a series of hydroponic assays were conducted using dual labelled (CN)-C-13-N-15- glycine, glutamic acid and urea supplied in both the absence and presence of NH4+. Results Results show rates of glycine and urea uptake were lower under elevated CO2 conditions for both species. Ratios of C-13 and N-15 in S. patens roots showed that at least 68 and 79\% of glycine under ambient and elevated CO2, respectively, was taken up intact. Provision of NH4+ with organic N caused organic N uptake rates to decline by up to 75\% in S. americanus and up to 50\% in S. patens compared with plants that only received organic N. Conclusions The reduction in organic N uptake in the presence of NH4+ suggests that plants rely primarily on mineral N in the field. In addition, we can deduce that organic N uptake is not likely to supply plants with the additional N required under elevated CO2, and that the repressive effects of elevated CO2 on organic N uptake may have negative consequences for ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration.

TI  - Long-term artificial seawater irrigation as a sustainable environmental management strategy for abandoned solar salt works: The case study of Agua Amarga salt marsh (SE Spain)
AB  - Groundwater abstraction is among the main anthropogenic causes of wetland desiccation worldwide, and corrective measures must be taken to avoid degradation of this valuable ecosystems. A case study is the Agua Amarga salt marsh (asymptotic to 180 ha) (SE Spain). Agua Amarga includes a solar saltwork pond network in operation between 1925 and 1975, when it was abandoned, and the ponds were colonized by salt marsh vegetation. In 2008 two desalination plants were operating in the marsh vicinity, which were supplied with groundwater. To mitigate the possible negative impact on the salt marsh ecosystem due to groundwater drawdown, in 2009 a sea water irrigation program was implemented. This paper summarizes the results of a ten-year monitoring program (2010-2020) to evaluate the effects of the irrigation program on groundwater levels and quality, soil salinity and moisture, and vegetation cover. During this period, average groundwater level was 2.5 m below the surface and around 1 m deep near the irrigated ponds. Groundwater salinity was not affected outside the saltmarsh, but inside, where the saltworks caused values to rise above 300 mS/cm, it decreased more than 150 mS/cm in some 20 m deep piezometers. Between 2012 and 2020, vegetation cover increased between asymptotic to 10 and asymptotic to 25 \%, with halophyte species such as Arthrocnemum macrostachyum and Sarcocornia fruticosa being the most favoured. In areas with prolonged flooding, Ruppia maritima, a plant species that lives submerged in saline water, was found. In the irrigated areas, soil electrical conductivity (1:5 soil:water extracts) decreased from asymptotic to 7-14 mS cm-1 to asymptotic to 2-6 mS cm-1. We present an example of sustainable actions in a coastal wetland, where the exploitation of water resources in semiarid areas is combined with promoting natural habitats.

TI  - Effects of conversion of mangroves into gei wai ponds on accumulation, speciation and risk of heavy metals in intertidal sediments
AB  - Mangroves are often converted into gei wai ponds for aquaculture, but how such conversion affects the accumulation and behavior of heavy metals in sediments is not clear. The present study aims to quantify the concentration and speciation of heavy metals in sediments in different habitats, including gei wai pond, mangrove marsh dominated by Avicennia marina and bare mudflat, in a mangrove nature reserve in South China. The results showed that gei wai pond acidified the sediment and reduced its electronic conductivity and total organic carbon (TOC) when compared to A. marina marsh and mudflat. The concentrations of Cd, Cu, Zn and Pb at all sediment depths in gei wai pond were lower than the other habitats, indicating gei wai pond reduced the fertility and the ability to retain heavy metals in sediment. Gei wai pond sediment also had a lower heavy metal pollution problem according to multiple evaluation methods, including potential ecological risk coefficient, potential ecological risk index, geo-accumulation index, mean PEL quotients, pollution load index, mean ERM quotients and total toxic unit. Heavy metal speciation analysis showed that gei wai pond increased the transfer of the immobilized fraction of Cd and Cr to the mobilized one. According to the acid-volatile sulfide (AVS) and simultaneously extracted metals (SEM) analysis, the conversion of mangroves into gei wai pond reduced values of ({[}SEM]-{[}AVS])/f(oc), and the role of TOC in alleviating heavy metal toxicity in sediment. This study demonstrated the conversion of mangrove marsh into gei wai pond not only reduced the ecological purification capacity on heavy metal contamination, but also enhanced the transfer of heavy metals from gei wai pond sediment to nearby habitats.

TI  - The role of elevation, relative sea-level history and vegetation transition in determining carbon distribution in Spartina alterniflora dominated salt marshes
AB  - Spartina alterniflora salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems on earth, and represent a substantial global carbon sink. Understanding the spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of both above- and below-ground carbon in these wetland ecosystems is especially important considering their potential in carbon sequestration projects, as well as for conservation efforts in the context of a changing climate and rising sea-level. Through the use of extensive field sampling and remote sensing data (Light Detection and Ranging - LiDAR, and aerial images), we sought to map and explain how vegetation biomass and soil carbon are related to elevation and relative sea-level change in a S. altemiflora dominated salt marsh on Galveston Island, Texas. The specific objectives of this study were to: 1) understand the relationship between elevation and the distribution of salt marsh vegetation percent cover, plant height, plant density, above-and below-ground biomass, and carbon, and 2) evaluate the temporal changes in relative sea-level history, vegetation transitions, and resulting changes in the patterns of soil carbon distribution. Our results indicated a clear zonation of terrain and vegetation characteristics (i.e., height, cover and biomass). In the soil profile, carbon concentrations and bulk densities showed significant and abrupt change at a depth of similar to 10-15 cm. This apparent transition in the soil characteristics coincided temporally with a transformation of the land cover, as driven by a rapid increase in relative sea-level around this time at the sample locations. The amounts of soil carbon stored in recently established S. alterniflora intertidal marshes were significantly lower than those that have remained in situ for a longer period of time. Thus, in order to quantify and predict carbon in coastal wetlands, and also to understand the heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of carbon stocks, it is essential to understand not only the elevation, the relative sea-level rise rate, and the vertical accretion rate - but also the history of land cover change and vegetation transition.

TI  - Stocks and losses of soil organic carbon from Chinese vegetated coastal habitats
AB  - Global vegetated coastal habitats (VCHs) represent a large sink for organic carbon (OC) stored within their soils. The regional patterns and causes of spatial variation, however, remain uncertain. The sparsity and regional bias of studies on soil OC stocks from Chinese VCHs have limited the reliable estimation of their capacity as regional and global OC sinks. Here, we use field and published data from 262 sampled soil cores and 181 surface soils to report estimates of soil OC stocks, burial rates and losses of VCHs in China. We find that Chinese mangrove, salt marsh and seagrass habitats have relatively low OC stocks, storing 6.3 +/- 0.6, 7.5 +/- 0.6, and 1.6 +/- 0.6 Tg C (+/- 95\% confidence interval) in the top meter of the soil profile with burial rates of 44 +/- 17, 159 +/- 57, and 6 +/- 45 Gg C/year, respectively. The variability in the soil OC stocks is linked to biogeographic factors but is mostly impacted by sedimentary processes and anthropic activities. All habitats have experienced significant losses, resulting in estimated emissions of 94.2-395.4 Tg CO(2)e (carbon dioxide equivalent) over the past 70 years. Reversing this trend through conservation and restoration measures has, therefore, great potential in contributing to the mitigation of climate change while providing additional benefits. This assessment, on a national scale from highly sedimentary environments under intensive anthropogenic pressures, provides important insights into blue carbon sink mechanism and sequestration capacities, thus contributing to the synchronous progression of global blue carbon management.

TI  - Total ecosystem carbon stocks at the marine-terrestrial interface: Blue carbon of the Pacific Northwest Coast, United States
AB  - The coastal ecosystems of temperate North America provide a variety of ecosystem services including high rates of carbon sequestration. Yet, little data exist for the carbon stocks of major tidal wetland types in the Pacific Northwest, United States. We quantified the total ecosystem carbon stocks (TECS) in seagrass, emergent marshes, and forested tidal wetlands, occurring along increasing elevation and decreasing salinity gradients. The TECS included the total aboveground carbon stocks and the entire soil profile (to as deep as 3Â m). TECS significantly increased along the elevation and salinity gradients: 217Â Â±Â 60Â MgÂ C/ha for seagrass (low elevation/high salinity), 417Â Â±Â 70Â MgÂ C/ha for low marsh, 551Â Â±Â 47Â MgÂ C/ha for high marsh, and 1,064Â Â±Â 38Â MgÂ C/ha for tidal forest (high elevation/low salinity). Soil carbon stocks accounted for >98% of TECS in the seagrass and marsh communities and 78% in the tidal forest. Soils in the 0â€“100Â cm portion of the profile accounted for only 48%â€“53% of the TECS in seagrasses and marshes and 34% of the TECS in tidal forests. Thus, the commonly applied limit defining TECS to a 100Â cm depth would greatly underestimate both carbon stocks and potential greenhouse gas emissions from land-use conversion. The large carbon stocks coupled with other ecosystem services suggest value in the conservation and restoration of temperate zone tidal wetlands through climate change mitigation strategies. However, the findings suggest that long-term sea-level rise effects such as tidal inundation and increased porewater salinity will likely decrease ecosystem carbon stocks in the absence of upslope wetland migration buffer zones.

TI  - The first national scale evaluation of organic carbon stocks and sequestration rates of coastal sediments along the West Sea, South Sea, and East Sea of South Korea
AB  - Blue carbon science requires the estimates of organic carbon stock and sequestration rate; however, holistic data analysis remains limited in South Korea. The present study reports current organic carbon stocks and sequestration rates in the coastal areas of West Sea, South Sea, and East Sea of South Korea, encompassing entire intertidal areas using long-term field survey combined with remote sensing technology. Twenty-one intertidal flats were targeted across seven provinces (Gyeonggi, Chungnam, Jeonbuk, Jeonnam, Gyeongnam, Gyeongbuk, Gangwon). Out of the evaluated environmental parameters, mud content represented a significant factor controlling sedimentary organic carbon stocks across target areas, and was significantly positively correlated to the total organic carbon (p &lt; 0.05). Organic carbon stocks measured in salt marshes (i.e., upper intertidal zone) reflected the high carbon fixation capacity of halophytes through primary production. Sediment textural type was classified using analysis of remotely sensed imagery, and was closely correlated to field-based classification data (p &lt; 0.05). Using field and remote sensing results, we estimated total organic carbon stocks (13,142,149 Mg C) and sequestration rates (71,383 Mg C yrâˆ’1) in the tidal flats of South Korea. This study presents the first report on blue carbon potential in the Korean tidal flats, providing baseline information on the carbon dynamics of intertidal sediments in this region and, potentially, elsewhere.

TI  - Variability in blue carbon storage related to biogeochemical factors in seagrass meadows off the coast of the Korean peninsula
AB  - Coastal vegetated habitats such as mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses, referred to as blue carbon ecosystems, play an important role in climate change mitigation by an effective CO2 capture from atmosphere and water columns and long-term organic carbon (Corg) storage in sediments. Although seagrass meadows are considered intense carbon sinks, information on regional variability in seagrass blue carbon stock and factors influencing its capacity still remain sparse. In the present study, seagrass blue carbon storage by measuring Corg stocks in sediments and living seagrass biomass, and carbon accumulation rates (CARs) in seagrass meadows were estimated along the Korean coast. Factors affecting variability in Corg stocks were also analyzed using partial least squares (PLS) regression and principal component analysis (PCA). Projected Corg stocks in sediment, extrapolated to a depth 1 m, exhibited substantial variability among sites, ranging from 49.91 to 125.71 Mg C haâˆ’1. The majority of Corg (96â€“99%) was stored in sediments, whereas the contribution of living biomass was minor. PLS regression and PCA indicated that Corg stocks in seagrass meadows are strongly associated with sediment characteristics such as dry bulk density and water and mud content. Among seagrass traits, above- to below-ground biomass ratio was significantly related to the quantity of Corg stocks in seagrass meadows. Because of the high spatial variability in Corg stocks and CARs, local and regional differences in seagrass blue carbon storage should be considered to accurately assess the climate change mitigation potential of seagrass ecosystems.

TI  - Large Natural pH, CO2 and O-2 Fluctuations in a Temperate Tidal Salt Marsh on Diel, Seasonal, and Interannual Time Scales
AB  - Coastal marine organisms experience dynamic pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions in their natural habitats, which may impact their susceptibility to long-term anthropogenic changes. Robust characterizations of all temporal scales of natural pH and DO fluctuations in different marine habitats are needed; however, appropriate time series of pH and DO are still scarce. We used multiyear (2008-2012), high-frequency (6 min) monitoring data to quantify diel, seasonal, and interannual scales of pH and DO variability in a productive, temperate tidal salt marsh (Flax Pond, Long Island, US). pH(NBS) and DO showed strong and similar seasonal patterns, with average (minimum) conditions declining from 8.2 (8.1) and 12.5 (11.4) mg l(-1) at the end of winter to 7.6 (7.2) and 6.3 (2.8) mg l(-1) in late summer, respectively. Concomitantly, average diel fluctuations increased from 0.22 and 2.2mg l(-1) (February) to 0.74 and 6.5 mg l(-1) (August), respectively. Diel patterns were modulated by tides and time of day, eliciting the most extreme minima when low tides aligned with the end of the night. Simultaneous in situ pCO(2) measurements showed striking fluctuations between similar to 330 and similar to 1,200 (early May), similar to 2,200 (mid June), and similar to 4,000 mu atm (end of July) within single tidal cycles. These patterns also indicate that the marsh's strong net heterotrophy influences its adjacent estuary by `outwelling' acidified the coupled and fluctuating nature of pH and DO conditions in productive coastal and estuarine environments, which have yet to be adequately represented by experiments.

TI  - The impact of sea embankment reclamation on soil organic carbon and nitrogen pools in invasive Spartina alterniflora and native Suaeda salsa salt marshes in eastern China
AB  - The construction of sea embankments is an increasingly common approach for controlling the spread of the exotic C-4 perennial grass Spartina alterniflora Loisel. in coastal wetlands of eastern China. However, the impact of sea embankment reclamation on the soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in salt marshes is not fully understood. In this study, we examined the stocks of the total, labile and recalcitrant organic C and N, the recalcitrant indices of C and N, and the concentrations of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and cumulative CO2-C mineralization (MINC) in sea embankment-reclaimed S. alterniflora and Suaeda salsa (Linn.) Pall. salt marshes through comparisons with adjacent unreclaimed S. alterniflora and S. salsa salt marshes in a coastal wetland of eastern China. Sea embankment reclamation significantly decreased plant biomass by 55.34\%, soil salinity by 81.71\%, soil moisture by 43.16\%, soil total organic C by 50.60\% and total organic N by 49.99\%, and also lowered labile and recalcitrant organic C and N, WSOC, MBC and MINC in the invasive S. alterniflora salt marsh. However, sea embankment reclamation did not significantly affect the stocks of the soil organic total C and N, recalcitrant organic C and N, and soil organic C dynamics in the native S. salsa salt marsh, possibly because the total quantity of S. salsa materials entering the soil, soil salinity, moisture and bulk density were not affected by sea embankment reclamation. Our results suggest that the impact of sea embankment reclamation on soil organic C and N pools is much more profound in S. alterniflora salt marsh than in S. salsa salt marsh. Sea embankment reclamation could greatly weaken the C and N sinks of S. alterniflora salt marsh and potentially affect C and N sinks in the coastal wetlands of eastern China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Soil greenhouse gas fluxes from tropical coastal wetlands and alternative agricultural land uses
AB  - Coastal wetlands are essential for regulating the global carbon budget through soil carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas (GHG - CO2, CH4, and N2O) fluxes. The conversion of coastal wetlands to agricultural land alters these fluxes' magnitude and direction (uptake/release). However, the extent and drivers of change of GHG fluxes are still unknown for many tropical regions. We measured soil GHG fluxes from three natural coastal wetlands - mangroves, salt marsh, and freshwater tidal forests - and two alternative agricultural land uses - sugarcane farming and pastures for cattle grazing (ponded and dry conditions). We assessed variations throughout different climatic conditions (dry-cool, dry-hot, and wet-hot) within 2 years of measurements (2018-2020) in tropical Australia. The wet pasture had by far the highest CH4 emissions with 1231 +/- 386 mgm(-2) d(-1), which were 200-fold higher than any other site. Dry pastures and sugarcane were the highest emitters of N2O with 55 +/- 9 mgm(-2) d(-1) (wet-hot period) and 11 +/- 3 mgm(-2) d(-1) (hot-dry period, coinciding with fertilisation), respectively. Dry pastures were also the highest emitters of CO2 with 20 +/- 1 gm(-2) d(-1) (wet-hot period). The three coastal wetlands measured had lower emissions, with salt marsh uptake of -0.55 +/- 0.23 and -1.19 +/- 0.08 gm(-2) d(-1) of N2O and CO2, respectively, during the dry-hot period. During the sampled period, sugarcane and pastures had higher total cumulative soil GHG emissions (CH4 C N2O) of 7142 and 56 124CO(2-eq) kg ha(-1) yr(-1) compared to coastal wetlands with 144 to 884CO(2-eq) kg ha(-1) yr(-1) (where CO2-eq is CO2 equivalent). Restoring unproductive sugarcane land or pastures (especially ponded ones) to coastal wetlands could provide significant GHG mitigation.

AB  - Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of tidal brackish wetlands in urban areas is largely unknown, albeit it is an important ecosystem service. High carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake of estuaries can potentially be achieved by creating conditions that foster CO2 uptake and sequestration. Thus, this study sought to assess NEE in a mesohaline tidal urban wetland that has been restored and determine the biophysical drivers of NEE in order to investigate uptake strength and drivers thereof. Beginning in 2009, NEE was measured using the eddy covariance technique in a restored urban estuarine wetland. Maximum NEE rates observed were -30 mu molm(-2)s(-1) under high light conditions in the summer. Monthly mean NEE showed this ecosystem to be a CO2 source in the winter, but a CO2 sink in summer. Conditional Granger causality showed the influence of net radiation on half daily to biweekly timescales on NEE and the influence of water level at half daily time scales. The overall productivity of this wetland is within the expected range of tidal brackish marshes and it was a sink for atmospheric CO2 in two out of the 3years of this study and had a continued increase over the study period.

TI  - Contribution of Donana Wetlands to Carbon Sequestration
AB  - Inland and transitional aquatic systems play an important role in global carbon (C) cycling. Yet, the C dynamics of wetlands and floodplains are poorly defined and field data is scarce. Air-water CO2 fluxes in the wetlands of Donana Natural Area (SW Spain) were examined by measuring alkalinity, pH and other physiochemical parameters in a range of water bodies during 2010-2011. Areal fluxes were calculated and, using remote sensing, an estimate of the contribution of aquatic habitats to gaseous CO2 transport was derived. Semi-permanent ponds adjacent to the large Guadalquivir estuary acted as mild sinks, whilst temporal wetlands were strong sources of CO2 (-0.8 and 36.3 mmol(CO2) m(-2) d(-1)). Fluxes in semi-permanent streams and ponds changed seasonally; acting as sources in spring-winter and mild sinks in autumn (16.7 and -1.2 mmol(CO2) m(-2) d(-1)). Overall, Donana's water bodies were a net annual source of CO2 (5.2 mol(C) m(-2) y(-1)). Up-scaling clarified the overwhelming contribution of seasonal flooding and allochthonous organic matter inputs in determining regional air-water gaseous CO2 transport (13.1 Gg(C) y(-1)). Nevertheless, this estimate is about 6 times < local marsh net primary production, suggesting the system acts as an annual net CO2 sink. Initial indications suggest longer hydroperiods may favour autochthonous C capture by phytoplankton. Direct anthropogenic impacts have reduced the hydroperiod in Donana and this maybe exacerbated by climate change (less rainfall and more evaporation), suggesting potential for the modification of C sequestration.

TI  - Stand density and carbon storage in cypress-tupelo wetland forests of the Mississippi River delta
AB  - Forested wetlands play a vital role in the coastal zone, but their vulnerability to coastal changeâ€”and the impact to high-value ecosystem servicesâ€”is not as well established as that of more seaward systems such as saltmarsh and mangroves. To address this need, we develop field-based stand density classes, then classify baldcypress-water tupelo (Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich var. distichum; Nyssa aquatica L.) stand density on the Mississippi River delta using a multitemporal ordination of reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery. Approximately 29, 50, and 21% of forest was classified as full canopy, intermediate, and open canopy, respectively. We estimate stand-level live-stem carbon stocks and annual accumulation rates of 96, 67, and 39 t-C ha âˆ’1 and 1.9, 1.4 and 0.8 t-C ha âˆ’1 yr âˆ’1 for full-canopy, intermediate, and open-canopy forest, respectively. Regional live-stem carbon stocks are âˆ¼ 69 t-C ha-1, and total carbon and annual increment for all forest analyzed are âˆ¼17 Mt-C and âˆ¼0.34 Mt-C yr-1. Much of the cypress-tupelo forest on the delta stores carbon at rates significantly below the potential of fully stocked stands, yet overall rates of accumulation are comparable to other forest types and coastal systems. Delta-wide, there is a well-defined coastward gradient of stand density, which has important implications for the future of deltaic forests and their ecosystem services. The similarities between forest density gradients and well-documented marsh loss patterns in the region suggest that the same processes driving coastal marsh lossâ€”relative sea level rise exacerbated by human activityâ€”are likely responsible for a second, more gradual interface of land loss at the marsh-forest boundary. Results highlight the potential response of coastal forests to continued environmental changeâ€”and associated impacts to the carbon cycleâ€”and provide a baseline for detecting future change to forests on the Mississippi River delta.

TI  - Dynamics of carbon sequestration in a coastal wetland using radiocarbon measurements
AB  - [} 1] Coastal wetlands are sensitive to global climate change and may play an important role in the global carbon cycle. However, the dynamics of carbon ( C) cycling in coastal wetlands and its response to sea level change associated with global warming is still poorly understood. In this study, we estimated the long-term and short-term rates of C accumulation, using C and C isotopic measurements of peat cores collected along a soil chronosequence, in a coastal wetland in north Florida. The long-term C accumulation rates determined by examining the C inventory and the radioactive decay of radiocarbon as a function of depth in the peat cores decrease with time from -130 +/- 9 g C/m(2)/yr over the last century to -13 +/- 2 g C/m(2)/yr over the millennium timescale. The short-term C accumulation rates estimated by examining the differences in the radiocarbon and C contents of the surfacial peat between archived ( 1985, 1988) and present ( 1996 and 1997) samples range from 42 to 193 g C/m(2)/yr in low marsh, from 18 to 184 g C/m(2)/yr in middle marsh, and from -50 to 181 g C/m(2)/yr in high marsh. The high end-values of our estimated short-term C accumulation rates are comparable to the estimated rates of C sequestration in coastal wetlands reported by Chmura et al. {[} 2003], but are significantly higher than our estimated long-term rates in the marshes and are also much higher than the published rates of C sequestration in northern peatlands. The higher recent rates of C accumulation in coastal marshes, in comparison with the longer-term rates, are due to slow but continuous decomposition of organic matter in the peat over time. However, other factors such as increased primary production in the coastal wetland over the last decades or century, due to a rise in mean sea level and/or CO2 and nitrogen fertilization effect, could also have contributed to the large difference between the recent and longer-term rates. Our data indicate that salt marshes in this area have been and continue to be a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. Because of higher rates of C sequestration and lower CH4 emissions, coastal wetlands could be more valuable C sinks per unit area than other ecosystems in a warmer world.

TI  - Species loss and nitrogen pollution alter litter decomposition dynamics in coastal salt marshes
AB  - Litter decomposition is a central ecosystem function because dead plant biomass plays a critical role in carbon storage, the nitrogen (N) cycle, and as food/habitat for animals and microorganisms. In the face of global change, interactions between organisms that participate in litter decomposition are likely to change due to species loss and N pollution. To understand how these global change factors may interact to alter litter decomposition, we manipulated the detritivore community and N concentrations in a coastal salt marsh for 2 years. We chose to manipulate densities of a dominant, detritivorous snail (Melampus bidentatus) because its population size is expected to decline due to climate change, yet its impact on litter decomposition has not been tested in the field. We measured litter decomposition rates, detritivore densities, and the N concentrations of sediment and litter. We found that endogenous N enrichment (N added live plants before decomposition), exogenous N enrichment (N added to decomposing plants) and higher densities of Melampus increased litter decomposition rates. Linear mixed models further revealed that snails, other detritivores, and soil NH4+ were the best predictors of litter mass loss in the middle stages of decomposition. Notably, exogenous N added to litter already enriched with N further increased mass loss but did not increase litter %N. Our study reveals how global change in the form species loss and N pollution can have palpable impacts on carbon cycling and ecosystem function.

TI  - Geotechnical properties of salt marsh and tidal flat substrates at Tillingham, Essex, UK
AB  - Salt marshes and, to a lesser extent, tidal flats, attenuate incoming hydrodynamic energy, thus reducing flood and erosion risk in the coastal hinterland. However, marshes are declining in aerial extent both globally and regionally (e.g. the Northwest European region). In order to comprehend why a reduction in salt marsh extent due to marsh edge erosion is occurring, we need to understand the resistance of salt marshes to incoming hydrodynamic energy. This resistance depends on marsh biological, geochemical and geotechnical properties. However, there currently exists no systematic study of marsh geotechnical properties and how these may impact both marsh edge and marsh surface erosion processes (e.g. surface removal, cliff undercutting, gravitational slumping). This has led to an oversimplification of marsh evolution models. Here, we present the initial results of a systematic study of salt marsh and tidal flat geotechnical properties (shear strength, plasticity and particle size) at Tillingham marsh, Essex, UK.

TI  - Annual carbon gases budgets for Phragmites australis marsh and Cyperus malaccensis marsh in the Minjiang River estuary
AB  - Coastal tidal marsh ecosystem is one of coastal blue carbon ecosystems in world, and has high carbon sequestration capacity per unit area. Measurement on carbon budgets at ecosystem scale is critical for revealing carbon source/sink process and carbon sequestration. However, at present data of simultaneous measurement of net ecosystem exchange of CO2(NEE) and methane (CH4) flux, and further assessment on carbon budgets has been poorly reported. Using transparent static chamber and shading by different refractive rates cloth+CO/H20 gas analyzer/gas chromatograph, we measured the NEE, ecosystem respiration (ER), and CH4flux in the brackish Phragmites australis marsh and the Cyperus malaccensis marsh in the Minjiang River estuary. We also fitted the relationship between gross ecosystem exchange (CEE) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), ER and air temperature, and then estimated the CEE, NEE, and ER at month and annual scales. Both the NEE and ER demonstrated distinctly seasonal variations. The two marsh ecosystems were atmospheric CO2sink in spring, summer, and autumn, however in winter they changed to atmospheric CO2sources. The carbon sequestration capacity of the P. australis marsh was significantly higher than that from the C. malaccensis marsh. The CH4flux from the P. australis marsh was not different from that from the C. malaccensis marsh. Simultaneously considering the CH4flux, we calculated the carbon sequestration capacity of the P. australis marsh and the C. malaccensis marsh at annual scale, which was (5371.52Â±336.97) g CO2-eq/m2and (2730.32Â±503.67) g CO2-eq/m2, respectively. The results suggest that both brackish P. australis marsh and C. malaccensis marsh in the Minjiang River estuary are strong atmospheric carbon sink, and plays an important role in mitigating global warming.

TI  - Increasing salinization and organic carbon burial rates in seagrass meadows from an anthropogenically-modified coastal lagoon in southern Gulf of Mexico
AB  - Intertidal ecosystems, such as marshes, mangroves, and seagrasses, contribute to the global carbon storage, helping to regulate atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Organic carbon (Corg) data from seagrass meadows in the Mexican coastline are still scarce, preventing appropriate evaluations of its contribution to mitigate global climate change. Recent temporal changes (â‰¤100 years) of Corg concentrations and burial rates were assessed in 210Pb dated cores from seagrass meadows at Terminos Lagoon, the largest coastal lagoon in the southern Gulf of Mexico. Irrespective of the predominant seagrass species, the cores showed comparable Corg concentrations (0.04â€“3.9%) and burial rates (2.5 â€“ 66.7 g mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1). Increasing salinization, likely caused by sea level rise, favoured Corg concentrations and burial rates in sediments with Halodule wrightii, while in sediments with Thalassia testudinum only Corg burial rates increased, owing to increasing mass accumulation rates, likely promoted by erosion induced by land use changes, and sea level rise. The mean Corg stock (1 m depth; 130 Â± 29 Mg haâˆ’1) was comparable with the global average Corg stock for seagrasses in other tropical areas around the world. Our results suggested that, under the current scenario of land use change and marine transgression, the seagrass meadows in Terminos Lagoon preserve the capacity for Corg accumulation and long-term preservation. However, both factors are also known to reduce seagrass resilience caused by water quality deterioration, thus these ecosystems must be monitored and protected from global change impacts, as part of climate change mitigation efforts.

TI  - Marsh-atmosphere CO2 exchange in a New England salt marsh
AB  - We studied marsh-atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide in a high marsh dominated salt marsh during the months of May to October in 2012-2014. Tidal inundation at the site occurred only during biweekly spring tides, during which we observed a reduction in fluxes during day and night. We estimated net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary production (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (R-eco) using a modified PLIRTLE model, which requires photosynthetically active radiation, temperature, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as control variables. NDVI decreased during inundation, when the marsh canopy was submerged. Two-time series of NDVI, including and excluding effects of tidal inundation, allowed us to quantify the flux reduction during inundation. The effect of the flux reduction was small (2-4\%) at our site, but is likely higher for marshes at a lower elevation. From May to October, GPP averaged -863 g C m(-2), R-eco averaged 591 g C m(-2), and NEE averaged -291 g C m(-2). In 2012, which was an exceptionally warm year, we observed an early start of net carbon uptake but higher respiration than in 2013 and 2014 due to higher-air temperature in August. This resulted in the lowest NEE during the study period (-255.96.9 g C m(-2)). The highest seasonal net uptake (-336.56.3 g C m(-2)) was observed in 2013, which was linked to higher rainfall and temperature in July. Mean sea level was very similar during all 3years which allowed us to isolate the importance of climatic factors.

Hydrology, soil carbon sequestration and water retention along a coastal wetland gradient in the Alvarado Lagoon System, Veracruz, Mexico. In: Martinez, M.L.; Taramelli, A., and Silva, R. (eds.), Coastal Resilience: Exploring the Many Challenges from Different Viewpoints. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 77, pp. 104-115. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. The Alvarado Lagoon System (ALS) is a wetland complex in the Gulf of Mexico, with different types of wetlands. We studied six wetland types that differ in species composition and dominant life forms: Rhizophora-Avicennia mangrove, Pachira aquatica freshwater forested wetland, Sabal mexicana flooded palm forest, two broad-leaved marshes (Pontederia sagittata marsh in Rio Blanco; Pithecellobium-Spartina marsh in Popoyeca) and a cattail (Typha domingensis) marsh. The hydroperiod data indicate that all wetland types are flooded for several months of the year, the palm forest having the longest period of time without inundation. Significantly higher (pâ‰¤0.05) carbon stocks at a depth of 1 m and soil water storage were recorded for the forested wetlands (60 Â± 6 kg C m-2, 889 L m-3 respectively) and P. sagittata broad-leaved marshes (67 Â± 9 kg C m-2, 882 L m-3). The lowest values were recorded for the flooded palm forest (16 Â± 5 kg C m-2, 533 L m-3) and the mangrove (16 Â± 2 kg C m-2, 463 L m-3). This makes the ALS an important provider of ecosystem services, most notably via its freshwater forested wetlands and marshes. Draining these wetlands for agricultural purposes could lead to differing degrees of change in the soil's hydraulic characteristics, such as a decrease in its capacity to retain water and the loss of organic matter, and therefore a reduced capacity for carbon storage.

TI  - Greenhouse gas flux from forests and wetlands: A review of the effects of disturbance
AB  - Forest and wetland ecosystems are significant carbon and nitrogen sinks at the global scale, and play an important role sequestering greenhouse gases and regulating climate. The three greenhouse gases fluxes from forest and wetland ecosystems are influenced by many factors,including disturbance. Here, we review the effects of disturbance on greenhouse gases fluxes from forest and wetlands. We separate the effects due to disturbance into two types: disturbance brought about by human activity and through natural means. The former includes forest-harvesting, fertilization, reclamation and tillage, and the latter includes fire, typhoon and hurricane. We discuss the impacts of these different disturbances on the fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O from both forest and wetland ecosystems. In many cases the conclusions from the literature were not consistent. Harvesting increased forest soil respiration in most studies; however, there was also one report showing that soil respiration dropped markedly because of a reduction in carbon input after forest removal. The response of three greenhouse gases to harvesting was also not consistent. Reclamation, a major disturbance in wetlands, tended to produce large impacts on the carbon and nitrogen dynamics. Some studies demonstrated an increased CO2 emission when marshlands were transformed to farmland, whereas another reports concluded that marsh reclamation caused the drop in CO2 emission. CH4 flux often decreased, and N2O flux generally increased when the marshes were reclaimed. The effects of fertilizer nitrogen input on greenhouse gases production and emission from marshes soil were complex with differences induced by different nitrogen fertilizers (NH4 NO3, (NH4)2 SO4, KNO3 and urea). The intensity of fire appeared to have an important influence on CH4 flux; a low-intensity fire increases CH4 flux, whereas a high-intensity fire will decrease CH4 flux. The CO2 flux-responses were also complex; some studies showed that fire inhibited CO2 flux, but others showed promotion effects. Tropical storms (typhoons and hurricanes) are a common disturbance feature in tropical and subtropical coastal forest and wetland ecosystems. CO2 emission generally dropped after the storm and N2 O flux often increased. We concluded our review with an analysis of trends in current research, and pointed out some urgent and key directions in future. A major suggestion was that it is becoming increasingly necessary to understand the mechanism through which the different types of disturbance influence greenhouse gases fluxes from forest and wetland ecosystems, and in particular to assess the effects at different spatial and temporal scales.

TI  - Extirpation-resistant species do not always compensate for the decline in ecosystem processes associated with biodiversity loss
AB  - Accelerating rates of biodiversity loss may result in a rapid decline in important ecosystem processes such as carbon capture. Whether extirpation-resistant species compensate for the decline in ecosystem processes associated with the loss of extirpation-prone species is poorly understood. We apply a novel approach to answer this question using an assemblage of salt marsh plants. First, manipulations were performed to simulate a realistic sequence of species loss, based on observed sensitivity to disturbance. Then, changes in biomass and primary production of extirpation-resistant species were monitored over three consecutive growing seasons. Extirpation-resistant species did not compensate for the loss of either biomass or primary production associated with the removal of extirpation-prone species. Factors that determine the potential for compensation within ecosystems are discussed. These include resource-regulated compensation rates, the level of functional redundancy within an assemblage and the extirpation resistance of species which possess good compensation traits. Synthesis. These results suggest that we cannot assume extirpation-resistant species will compensate for the decline in ecosystem processes associated with biodiversity loss across all ecosystems. Understanding those factors that influence the ability of ecosystems to compensate for declines in ecosystem processes associated with biodiversity loss constitutes a significant challenge.

TI  - Placing barrier-island transgression in a blue-carbon context
AB  - Backbarrier saltmarshes are considered carbon sinks; however, barrier island transgression and the associated processes of erosion and overwash are typically not included in coastal carbon budgets. Here, we present a carbon-budget model for transgressive barrier islands that includes a dynamic carbon-storage term, driven by backbarrier-marsh width, and a carbon-export term, driven by ocean and backbarrier shoreline erosion. To examine the impacts of storms, human disturbances and the backbarrier setting of a transgressive barrier island on carbon budgets and reservoirs, the model was applied to sites at Core Banks and Onslow Beach, NC, USA. Results show that shoreline erosion and burial of backbarrier marsh from washover deposition and dredge-spoil disposal temporarily transitioned each site into a net exporter (source) of carbon. The magnitude of the carbon reservoir was linked to the backbarrier setting of an island. Carbon reservoirs of study sites separated from the mainland by only backbarrier marsh (no lagoon) decreased for over a decade because carbon storage could not keep pace with erosion. With progressive narrowing of the backbarrier marsh, these barriers will begin to function more persistently as carbon sources until the reservoir is depleted at the point where the barrier welds with the mainland. Undeveloped barrier islands with wide lagoons are carbon sources briefly during erosive periods; however, at century time scales are net carbon importers (sinks) because new marsh habitat can form during barrier rollover. Human development on backbarrier saltmarsh serves to reduce the carbon storage capacity and can hasten the transition of an island from a sink to a source.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration and Sediment Accretion in San Francisco Bay Tidal Wetlands
AB  - Tidal wetlands play an important role with respect to climate change because of both their sensitivity to sea-level rise and their ability to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Policy-based interest in carbon sequestration has increased recently, and wetland restoration projects have potential for carbon credits through soil carbon sequestration. We measured sediment accretion, mineral and organic matter accumulation, and carbon sequestration rates using 137Cs and 210Pb downcore distributions at six natural tidal wetlands in the San Francisco Bay Estuary. The accretion rates were, in general, 0. 2-0. 5 cm year -1, indicating that local wetlands are keeping pace with recent rates of sea-level rise. Mineral accumulation rates were higher in salt marshes and at low-marsh stations within individual sites. The average carbon sequestration rate based on 210Pb dating was 79 g C m -2 year -1, with slightly higher rates based on 137Cs dating. There was little difference in the sequestration rates among sites or across stations within sites, indicating that a single carbon sequestration rate could be used for crediting tidal wetland restoration projects within the Estuary.

TI  - Carbon burial and storage in tropical salt marshes under the influence of sea level rise
AB  - Coastal vegetated habitats can be important sinks of organic carbon (Corg) and mitigate global warming by sequestering significant quantities of atmospheric CO2 and storing sedimentary Corg for long periods, although their Corg burial and storage capacity may be affected by on-going sea level rise and human intervention. Geochemical data from published 210Pb-dated sediment cores, collected from low-energy microtidal coastal wetlands in El Salvador (Jiquilisco Bay) and in Mexico (Salada Lagoon; Estero de Urias Lagoon; Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve) were revisited to assess temporal changes (within the last 100 years) of Corg concentrations, storage and burial rates in tropical salt marshes under the influence of sea level rise and contrasting anthropization degree. Grain size distribution was used to identify hydrodynamic changes, and Î´13C to distinguish terrigenous sediments from those accumulated under the influence of marine transgression. Although the accretion rate ranges in all sediment records were comparable, Corg concentrations (0.2â€“30%), stocks (30â€“465 Mg haâˆ’1, by extrapolation to 1 m depth), and burial rates (3â€“378 g mâˆ’2 yearâˆ’1) varied widely within and among the study areas. However, in most sites sea level rise decreased Corg concentrations and stocks in sediments, but increased Corg burial rates. Lower Corg concentrations were attributed to the input of reworked marine particles, which contribute with a lower amount of Corg than terrigenous sediments; whereas higher Corg burial rates were driven by higher mass accumulation rates, influenced by increased flooding and human interventions in the surroundings. Corg accumulation and long-term preservation in tropical salt marshes can be as high as in mangrove or temperate salt marsh areas and, besides the reduction of Corg stocks by ongoing sea level rise, the disturbance of the long-term buried Corg inventories might cause high CO2 releases, for which they must be protected as a part of climate change mitigation efforts.

TI  - Vegetation Zonation Predicts Soil Carbon Mineralization and Microbial Communities in Southern New England Salt Marshes
AB  - Coastal marshes are important blue carbon reservoirs, but it is unclear how vegetation shifts associated with tidal restoration and sea level rise alter soil microbial respiration rates and bacterial community composition. Within 20 Connecticut salt marshes (10 without tidal restrictions, 10 tidally restored), we sampled three vegetation zones dominated by Spartina alterniflora (short-form, < 30 cm tall), S. patens, and Phragmites australis to estimate microbial respiration rates (SIR, substrate-induced respiration; carbon mineralization), root zone bacterial 16S rRNA genes, and a suite of plant and soil characteristics. Carbon density was greater in unrestricted marshes than tidally restored marshes and was the only parameter that differed among sites with varying restoration histories. We observed strong differences among vegetation zones, with vegetation being a top predictor of both SIR and carbon mineralization. Electrical conductivity (EC) was also a top predictor for SIR, and we observed strong, positive correlations between EC and both metrics of microbial respiration, with elevated rates in more frequently inundated S. alterniflora than P. australis zones. We also observed distinct root zone microbial communities associated with vegetation zones, with greater abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria in Spartina spp. zones. Our findings suggest that dominant salt marsh vegetation zones are useful indicators of hydrologic conditions and could be used to estimate microbial respiration rates; however, it is still unclear whether differences in microbial respiration and community composition among vegetation zones are driven by plant community, environmental conditions, or their interactions.

TI  - The Effect of Fertilization on Biomass and Metabolism in North Carolina Salt Marshes: Modulated by Location-Specific Factors
AB  - The resilience of salt marshes to sea level rise depends on vertical accretion through belowground biomass production and sediment deposition to maintain elevation above sea level. Increased nitrogen (N) availability from anthropogenic sources may stimulate aboveground biomass production and sediment deposition and, thus, accretion; however, increased N may also negatively impact marsh accretion by decreasing belowground biomass and increasing net CO2 emissions. A study was conducted in Spartina alterniflora-dominated salt marshes in North Carolina, USA, to determine how responses to fertilization vary across locations with different physical and chemical characteristics. Pore water residence time, inundation time, and proximity to tidal creeks drove spatial differences in pore water sulfide, ammonium, and dissolved carbon concentrations. Although annual respiration and gross primary production were greater at the creek edge than interior marsh sites, net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) was nearly balanced at all the sites. Fertilization decreased belowground biomass in the interior sites but not on the creek edge. Aboveground biomass, respiration, gross primary production, and net CO2 emissions increased in response to fertilization, but responses were diminished in interior marsh locations with high pore water sulfide. Hourly NEE measured by chambers were similar to hourly NEE observed by a nearby eddy covariance tower, but correcting for inundation depth relative to plant height was critical for accurate extrapolation to annual fluxes. The impact of fertilization on biomass and NEE, and thus marsh resilience, varied across marsh locations depending upon location-specific pore water sulfide concentrations.

TI  - Impact of nitrogen and importance of silicon on mechanical stem strength in Schoenoplectus acutus and Schoenoplectus californicus: applications for restoration
AB  - Nitrogen (N) and Silicon (Si) availability can affect the vigor and resiliency of plant communities. The effects of N on plant growth has been investigated in multiple species and is understood to promote growth. Though it is generally understood that Si aids in plant functions such as stem strength enhancement and herbivory defense, the role Si has not been explored in many wetland plant species. Tidal wetland plants are often subjected to high wind and wave energy, which can cause breakage or collapse of stems. This body of research investigated the combined effects of Si and N regimes to reduce the occurrence of stem collapse through its influence on stem strength. We investigated the effects of Si and N concentration on the growth, morphology, and physiology of Schoenoplectus acutus and Schoenoplectus californicus, two species of macrophytes that are commonly used in freshwater tidal restoration plantings. Individuals of each species were grown hydroponically in four different nutrient combinations (low Si and low N, low Si and high N, high Si and low N, and high Si and high N). Results indicated that increased N concentrations promoted aboveground biomass production, whereas increased Si concentration enhanced stem strength and decreased the likelihood of stem collapse and herbivory. Plants receiving a high Si and low N nutrient combination exhibited the most robust stems. Our findings emphasize the importance of Si, as well as N, in Schoenoplectus spp. growth and highlight the potential applications for these nutrients in enhancing tidal marsh management.

TI  - Belowground productivity varies by assessment technique, vegetation type, and nutrient availability in tidal freshwater forested wetlands transitioning to marsh
AB  - Wetlands along upper estuaries are characterized by dynamic transitions between forested and herbaceous communities (marsh) as salinity, hydroperiod, and nutrients change. The importance of belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) associated with fine and coarse root growth also changes but remains the dominant component of overall productivity in these important blue carbon wetlands. Appropriate BNPP assessment techniques to use in various tidal wetlands are not well-defined, and could make a difference in BNPP estimation. We hypothesized that different BNPP techniques applied among tidal wetlands differ in estimation of BNPP and possibly also correlate differently with porewater nutrient concentrations. We compare 6-month and 12-month root ingrowth, serial soil coring techniques utilizing two different calculations, and a mass balance approach (TBCA, Total Belowground Carbon Allocation) among four tidal wetland types along each of two river systems transitioning from freshwater forest to marsh. Median values of BNPP were 266 to 2946 g/m(2)/year among all techniques used, with lower BNPP estimation from root ingrowth cores and TBCA (266-416 g/m(2)/year), and higher BNPP estimation from serial coring of standing crop root biomass (using Smalley and Max-Min calculation methods) (2336-2946 g/m(2)/year). Root turnover (or longevity) to a soil depth of 30 cm was 2.2/year (1.3 years), 2.7/year (1.1 years), 4.5/year (0.9 years), and 1.2/year (2.6 years), respectively, for Upper Forest, Middle Forest, Lower Forest, and Marsh. Marsh had greater root biomass and BNPP, with slower root turnover (greater root longevity) versus forested wetlands. Soil porewater concentrations of NH3 and reactive phosphorus stimulated BNPP in the marsh when assessed with short-deployment BNPP techniques, indicating that pulses of mineralized nutrients may stimulate BNPP to facilitate marsh replacement of forested wetlands. Overall, ingrowth techniques appeared to represent forested wetland BNPP adequately, while serial coring may be necessary to represent herbaceous plant BNPP from rhizomes as marshes replace forested wetlands.

TI  - A long-term comparison of carbon sequestration rates in impounded and naturally tidal freshwater marshes along the Lower Waccamaw River, South Carolina
AB  - Carbon storage was compared between impounded and naturally tidal freshwater marshes along the Lower Waccamaw River in South Carolina, USA. Soil cores were collected in (1) naturally tidal, (2) moist soil (impounded, seasonally drained since ~1970), and (3) deeply flooded "treatments" (impounded, flooded to ~90 cm since ~2002). Cores were analyzed for % organic carbon, % total carbon, bulk density, and 210Pb and 137Cs for dating purposes. Carbon sequestration rates ranged from 25 to 200 g C m -2 yr-1 (moist soil), 80-435 g C m-2 yr -1 (naturally tidal), and 100-250 g C m-2 yr-1 (deeply flooded). The moist soil and naturally tidal treatments were compared over a period of 40 years. The naturally tidal treatment had significantly higher carbon storage (mean = 219 g C m-2 yr-1 vs. mean = 91 g C m-2 yr-1) and four times the vertical accretion rate (mean = 0.84 cm yr-1 vs. mean = 0.21 cm yr-1) of the moist soil treatment. The results strongly suggest that the long drainage period in moist soil management limits carbon storage over time. Managers across the National Wildlife Refuge system have an opportunity to increase carbon storage by minimizing drainage in impoundments as much as practicable. Â© 2013 US Government.

TI  - Protecting irrecoverable carbon in Earth's ecosystems
AB  - Avoiding catastrophic climate change requires rapid decarbonization and improved ecosystem stewardship. To achieve the latter, ecosystems should be prioritized by responsiveness to direct, localized action and the magnitude and recoverability of their carbon stores. Here, we show that a range of ecosystems contain `irrecoverable carbon' that is vulnerable to release upon land use conversion and, once lost, is not recoverable on timescales relevant to avoiding dangerous climate impacts. Globally, ecosystems highly affected by human land-use decisions contain at least 260 Gt of irrecoverable carbon, with particularly high densities in peatlands, mangroves, old-growth forests and marshes. To achieve climate goals, we must safeguard these irrecoverable carbon pools through an expanded set of policy and finance strategies. In order to limit warming and the most severe consequences of climate change, net global carbon emissions must reach zero by 2050. Many ecosystems contain carbon that would be irrecoverable on this timescale if lost and must be protected to meet climate goals.

TI  - Aboveground carbon loss associated with the spread of ghost forests as sea levels rise
AB  - Coastal forests sequester and store more carbon than their terrestrial counterparts but are at greater risk of conversion due to sea level rise. Saltwater intrusion from sea level rise converts freshwater-dependent coastal forests to more salt-tolerant marshes, leaving â€˜ghost forestsâ€™ of standing dead trees behind. Although recent research has investigated the drivers and rates of coastal forest decline, the associated changes in carbon storage across large extents have not been quantified. We mapped ghost forest spread across coastal North Carolina, USA, using repeat Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) surveys, multi-temporal satellite imagery, and field measurements of aboveground biomass to quantify changes in aboveground carbon. Between 2001 and 2014, 15% (167 km2) of unmanaged public land in the region changed from coastal forest to transition-ghost forest characterized by salt-tolerant shrubs and herbaceous plants. Salinity and proximity to the estuarine shoreline were significant drivers of these changes. This conversion resulted in a net aboveground carbon decline of 0.13 Â± 0.01 TgC. Because saltwater intrusion precedes inundation and influences vegetation condition in advance of mature tree mortality, we suggest that aboveground carbon declines can be used to detect the leading edge of sea level rise. Aboveground carbon declines along the shoreline were offset by inland aboveground carbon gains associated with natural succession and forestry activities like planting (2.46 Â± 0.25 TgC net aboveground carbon across study area). Our study highlights the combined effects of saltwater intrusion and land use on aboveground carbon dynamics of temperate coastal forests in North America. By quantifying the effects of multiple interacting disturbances, our measurement and mapping methods should be applicable to other coastal landscapes experiencing saltwater intrusion. As sea level rise increases the landward extent of inundation and saltwater exposure, investigations at these large scales are requisite for effective resource allocation for climate adaptation. In this changing environment, human intervention, whether through land preservation, restoration, or reforestation, may be necessary to prevent aboveground carbon loss. Â© 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Effects of flooding and warming on soil organic matter mineralization in Avicennia germinans mangrove forests and Juncus roemerianus salt marshes
AB  - Under a changing climate, coastal wetlands experience sea level rise, warming, and vegetation change, all of which may influence organic matter mineralization. In coastal wetlands of subtropical west-central Florida (USA), we investigated how soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mineralization respond to soil water, temperature, and ecosystem type (Avicennia germinans mangrove forest vs. Juncus roemerianus salt marsh). We evaluated how soil respiration and mineral N concentration varied along a soil moisture gradient, and whether these relationships differed between ecosystem types. Then, we manipulated soils in a 28-d laboratory incubation to evaluate how potentially mineralizable C and N respond to temperature (23 vs. 27 degrees C), soil hydroperiod (inundated 4 vs. 20 h/d), and soil source. Soil saturation and inundation suppressed short-term (minutes to weeks) C mineralization from near-surface soils. Soil CO2 efflux declined by 65\% as soil moisture increased from 75\% to 85\%, and potentially mineralizable C was 18\% lower with a 20-h hydroperiod than with a 4-h hydroperiod. Organic C quality appears to be greater in A. germinans than in J. roemerianus soils, as A. germinans soils had higher field CO2 efflux rates and greater mineralizable C:N (despite lower total C:N). Increasing incubation temperature from 23 to 27 degrees C elevated potentially mineralizable C by 40\%, indicating that two symptoms of climate change (increased inundation from sea level rise, and warming) may have opposing effects on soil C mineralization. Temperature sensitivity of C mineralization was high for long-hydroperiod soils, however, suggesting that protection of soil organic matter (SUM) due to prolonged inundation will be undermined by warming. Potentially mineralizable N was greater in J. roemerianus soils, although in situ mineral N was not different between ecosystems, instead correlating positively with SOM. These results indicate that models forecasting soil elevation responses to climate change might include inundation effects on mineralization rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Fiddler crab burrowing increases salt marsh greenhouse gas emissions
AB  - Salt marshes are globally important sites of carbon burial, but microbial processes in their soil produce potent greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) that can be released back to the atmosphere. Although a great deal is known about how shifting seasons, tides, and salinity influence salt marsh greenhouse gas emissions, little effort has been devoted to understanding how emissions respond to bioturbation and pollution. In this study, we evaluated how fiddler crab bioturbation and oil pollution altered CO2 and CH4 fluxes from Louisiana salt marsh soil through a series of microcosm incubation experiments. CO2 and CH4 fluxes did not consistently increase as a function of crab burrow depth even though soil CO2 and CH4 concentrations increased with depth. Instead, regardless of burrow depth, CO2 and CH4 fluxes were highest (536.7 Â± 41.6 and 6.35 Â± 0.59Â nmolÂ gâˆ’1Â hâˆ’1, respectively) immediately after burrowing activity ceased and within ~ 2Â h decreased to a low background level (117.4 Â± 17.1 and 0.53 Â± 0.26). These background CO2 fluxes persisted through the end of our experiments, but background CH4 fluxes were not detectable after &lt; 1Â day, suggesting an important role for methanotrophy. Therefore, crab burrow size had a strong influence on CO2 fluxes, while the rate of burrow excavation was more important for CH4 fluxes. Low to moderate oil concentrations (up to 25.55Â mgÂ cmâˆ’2) did not alter greenhouse gas fluxes. However, severe oil contamination that decreases fiddler crab abundance and burrowing activity will also indirectly decrease salt marsh greenhouse gas emissions. These findings illuminate the importance of fiddler crab bioturbation to salt marsh carbon cycling and export. Â© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Vulnerability to sea-level rise and the potential for restoration to enhance blue carbon storage in salt marshes of an urban estuary
AB  - Coastal wetlands are vulnerable to sea-level rise (SLR) but are also valued for their potential to provide effective nature-based solutions to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Ecological benefits from these ecosystems can be constrained under urban settings by anthropogenic disturbances and pressures, so restoration activities are promoted as a management approach. Here we report on the potential for restoration of disused commercial salt extraction pans to enhance carbon (C) sequestration in the urban Swartkops Estuary, South Africa. We also considered the impact of SLR to 2100 on the distribution of estuarine habitats, the vulnerability of built infrastructure to tidal flooding, and how C sequestration is projected to change over time using the Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM). Potential restoration of all salt pans (320 ha) to estuarine habitat was estimated to result in a gain of 67 850 Mg C. Establishing tidal connectivity was investigated as a potential restoration action, but most of the salt pan area was above the elevation of the current tidal range and would require excavation. Although conversion of the salt pans to estuarine habitat was predicted to occur without intervention under SLR, 44\% of the original area would remain unchanged. Restoring hydrological connectivity to the estuary for these salt pans would significantly increase the extent of transitional/floodplain marsh, even under SLR to 2100. C sequestration was predicted to be 15\% higher (54 614.8 Mg C) by 2100 if the salt pans could be restored, compared to if no action is taken. Overall, restoration of the salt pans has the potential to enhance C sequestration, but SLR will still cause large losses of supratidal marsh due to `coastal squeeze' and extensive tidal flooding of developed areas by 2100 in the lower reaches of the estuary. A full-scale restoration approach for the Swartkops Estuary could use C sequestration potential to fund the project through carbon offsetting if the revenue exceeds the cost of the restoration activities, but additional social and ecological goals also need to be incorporated if the outcome is to be holistic and beneficial.

TI  - Quantifying how changing mangrove cover affects ecosystem carbon storage in coastal wetlands
AB  - Despite overall global declines, mangroves are expanding into and within many subtropical wetlands, leading to heterogeneous cover of marsh-mangrove coastal vegetation communities near the poleward edge of mangroves' ranges. Coastal wetlands are globally important carbon sinks, yet the effects of shifts in mangrove cover on organic-carbon (OC) storage remains uncertain. We experimentally maintained black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) or marsh vegetation in patches (n = 1,120, 3 x 3 m) along a gradient in mangrove cover (0-100\%) within coastal wetland plots (n = 10, 24 x 42 m) and measured changes in OC stocks and fluxes. Within patches, above and belowground biomass (OC) was 1,630\% and 61\% greater for mangroves than for recolonized marshes, and soil OC was 30\% greater beneath mangrove than marsh vegetation. At the plot scale, above and belowground biomass increased linearly with mangrove cover but soil OC was highly variable and unrelated to mangrove cover. Root ingrowth was not different in mangrove or marsh patches, nor did it change with mangrove cover. After 11 months, surface OC accretion was negatively related to plot-scale mangrove cover following a high-wrack deposition period. However, after 22 months, accretion was 54\% higher in mangrove patches, and there was no relationship to plot-scale mangrove cover. Marsh (Batis maritima) leaf and root litter had 1,000\% and 35\% faster breakdown rates (k) than mangrove (A. germinans) leaf and root litter. Soil temperatures beneath mangroves were 1.4 degrees C lower, decreasing aboveground k of fast- (cellulose) and slow-decomposing (wood) standard substrates. Wood k in shallow soil (0-15 cm) was higher in mangrove than marsh patches, but vegetation identity did not impact k in deeper soil (15-30 cm). We found that mangrove cover enhanced OC storage by increasing biomass, creating more recalcitrant organic matter and reducing k on the soil surface by altering microclimate, despite increasing wood k belowground and decreasing allochthonous OC subsidies. Our results illustrate the importance of mangroves in maintaining coastal OC storage, but also indicate that the impacts of vegetation change on OC storage may vary based on ecosystem conditions, organic-matter sources, and the relative spatiotemporal scales of mangrove vegetation change.

TI  - Pore-water exchange flushes blue carbon from intertidal saltmarsh sediments into the sea
AB  - We quantified whether pore-water exchange flushes out saltmarsh sediment carbon, driving carbon outwelling into the ocean and outgassing into the atmosphere. Radon-derived pore-water exchange released 1.8 times more sediment carbon in the wet than in dry season. Both crab burrow flushing and delayed seepage of surface water infiltrating sediments during the spring tide released sediment carbon to surface waters. The outwelling flux of dissolved inorganic carbon exceeded dissolved organic carbon. Carbon dioxide and methane emissions were 169 and 0.25 mmol m(-2) d(-1), respectively. Pore-water carbon fluxes exceeded carbon outwelling. This requires some carbon processing within the saltmarsh (e.g., degradation or outgassing to the atmosphere) before pore-water carbon is exported to the ocean. Overall, pore-water exchange and outwelling are key components of saltmarsh carbon budgets and should be considered when assessing their carbon sequestration potential and strategies to mitigate climate change.

TI  - Marsh processes and their response to climate change and sea-level rise
AB  - In addition to their being vital components of mid- to high-latitude coastal ecosystems, salt marshes contain 0.1% of global sequestered terrestrial carbon. Their sustainability is now threatened by accelerating sea-level rise (SLR) that has reached a rate that is many times greater than the rate at which they formed and evolved. Modeling studies have been instrumental in predicting how marsh systems will respond to greater frequencies and durations of tidal inundation and in quantifying thresholds when marshes will succumb and begin to disintegrate due to accelerating SLR. Over the short term, some researchers believe that biogeomorphic feedbacks will improve marsh survival through greater biomass productivity enhanced by warmer temperatures and higher carbon dioxide concentrations. Increased sedimentation rates are less likely due to lower-than-expected suspended sediment concentrations. The majority of marsh loss today is through wave-induced edge erosion that beneficially adds sediment to the system. Edge erosion is partly offset by upland marsh migration during SLR. â–ª Despite positive biogeomorphic feedbacks, many salt marshes will succumb to accelerating sea-level rise due to insufficient mineral sediment. â–ª The latest multivariate marsh modeling is producing predictions of marsh evolution under various sea-level rise scenarios. â–ª The least well-known variables in projecting changes to salt marshes are suspended sediment concentrations and net sediment influx to the marsh. â–ª We are in the infancy of understanding the importance and processes of marsh edge erosion and the overall dynamicism of marshes. â–ª This review defines the latest breakthroughs in understanding the response of salt marshes to accelerating sea-level rise and decreasing sediment supply. â–ª Climate change is accelerating sea-level rise, warming temperatures, and increasing carbon dioxide, all of which are impacting marsh vegetation and vertical accretion.

TI  - Water-air gas exchange of CO2 and CH4 in coastal wetlands
AB  - This chapter discusses carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) gas exchange at the water-air interface in coastal wetlands. The existing literature was reviewed to report the magnitude of CO2 and CH4 water-air fluxes in mangrove, saltmarsh, and seagrass ecosystems. Based on available data, mangrove waters show a large range of CO2 (13â€“9726mgCO2mâˆ’2 dayâˆ’1) and CH4 water-air fluxes (âˆ’1.1â€“1169mgCH4 mâˆ’2 dayâˆ’1) and are generally a source of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere. Similarly, saltmarsh waters are predominantly water-air sources of CO2 (mean: 2823Â±332mgCO2 mâˆ’2 dayâˆ’1) and CH4 (âˆ’1.5â€“1510mgCH4 mâˆ’2 dayâˆ’1). In contrast, seagrass waters can act as a source or sink of CO2 (âˆ’3168â€“3041mgCO2 mâˆ’2 dayâˆ’1) and are likely a source of CH4 to the atmosphere (1.9â€“4.9mgCH4 mâˆ’2 dayâˆ’1). High spatial and temporal variability and the large range of fluxes are linked to tidal regimes, seasonality, vegetation coverage, and complex biogeochemical processes that occur in coastal wetland sediments and waters. Various direct and indirect drivers are described that can control CO2 and CH4 concentration gradients, transport pathways, and fluxes from sediments to the water column and ultimately to the atmosphere. Finally, the three most commonly used methods to determine water-air gas exchange in coastal waters are reviewed, which are the chamber method, the gradient flux method, and the eddy-covariance technique. Using appropriate methods, more research is needed for a better assessment of long-term and large-scale gas exchange in dynamic coastal wetland waters, to quantify more accurately present and to predict future greenhouse gas trends and potential â€œblue carbonâ€ offsets in mangrove, saltmarsh, and seagrasses on regional and global scale.

TI  - Experimental sediment addition in salt-marsh management: Plant-soil carbon dynamics in southern New England
AB  - Thin Layer Placement (TLP) is an increasingly used management technique to promote coastal resilience to accelerated sea level rise, but it is unclear how differential thickness of dredged sediment application alters plantsoil carbon dynamics in northeastern Atlantic coast salt marshes. We initiated a field experiment in a microtidal Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) dominated salt marsh in Connecticut (USA) to examine how a silt-loam dredge applied at different thicknesses (low: +5 cm, medium: +10 cm, and high: +15 cm) altered biological and biogeochemical responses. Over two growing seasons we monitored plant responses (above and belowground biomass, stem height, stem density, leaf area) and soil-biogeochemical parameters (EC, pH, redox, NH4+, sulfides, C:N, decomposition, bulk density, carbon fluxes). We found adding 5-7 cm of dredged sediment promoted rapid revegetation, alleviated phytotoxic sulfides, enhanced CO2 uptake, and reduced CH4 emissions. Low treatments reached similar vegetation cover to controls after one growing season, though sediment treatments greater than 10-cm thick showed delayed growth. Low levels of sediment addition stimulated the highest root biomass in the underlying soil, promoting CO2 efflux, but this was offset by aboveground biomass productivity, promoting net CO2 uptake. Phytotoxic sulfides were reduced in all sediment addition treatments, but our data indicate that coastal managers aiming to promote rapid vegetative recovery while increasing elevation in the short term should target conservative depths (< 10 cm) when using fine-grained dredged material. Collectively, our work will guide wetland managers as they develop restoration specifications for perpetuating coastal marshes in the face of rising seas.

AB  - Owing to the high carbon capture and storage capacity, salt marshes are considered an effective blue carbon sink for mitigating global warming. In addition, salt marshes are likely to increase their carbon sink capacity in the future in response to climate warming and sea level rise. Therefore, the blue carbon sink function of salt marshes has received increasing attention from the international research community. This study reviewed the five aspects comprising the key processes of blue carbon formation, photosynthetic carbon allocation, burial fluxes and sources of sedimentary organic carbon, stability of soil carbon pools and the associated microbial mechanisms, and the simulation and assessment of blue carbon sequestration potentials in salt marshes. On this basis, concerning the main knowledge gaps, this paper proposes further research on the effect of vegetation distribution pattern along the land-to-sea hydrologic gradient on photosynthetic carbon fixation and allocation, the response of soil organic carbon deposition and burial to global change, the stability of soil carbon pools and its lateral exchange, blue carbon simulation and assessment of blue carbon sink potential in the context of climate change and sea level rise, and technologies and approaches of blue carbon sequestration in salt marshes. Prioritizing these research topics may elucidate the formation processes and mechanisms of blue carbon, predict the changing trend of blue carbon sequestration potential under global changes, and offer new insights into achieving the goal of "carbon peak and carbon neutrality".

TI  - Modeling impacts of drought-induced salinity intrusion on carbon dynamics in tidal freshwater forested wetlands
AB  - Tidal freshwater forested wetlands (TFFW) provide critical ecosystem services including an essential habitat for a variety of wildlife species and significant carbon sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide. However, large uncertainties remain concerning the impacts of climate change on the magnitude and variability of carbon fluxes and storage across a range of TFFW. In this study, we developed a process-driven Tidal Freshwater Wetlands DeNitrification-DeComposition model (TFW-DNDC) that has integrated new features, such as soil salinity effects on plant productivity and soil organic matter decomposition to explore carbon dynamics in the TFFW in response to drought-induced saltwater intrusion. Eight sites along the floodplains of the Waccamaw River (USA) and the Savannah River (USA) were selected to represent the TFFW transition from healthy to moderately and highly salt-impacted forests, and eventually to oligohaline marshes. The TFW-DNDC was calibrated and validated using field observed annual litterfall, stem growth, root growth, soil heterotrophic respiration, and soil organic carbon storage. Analyses indicate that plant productivity and soil carbon sequestration in TFFW could change substantially in response to increased soil pore water salinity and reduced soil water table due to drought, but in interactive ways dependent on the river simulated. These responses are variable due to nonlinear relationships between carbon cycling processes and environmental drivers. Plant productivity, plant respiration, soil organic carbon sequestration rate, and storage in the highly salt-impacted forest sites decreased significantly under drought conditions compared with normal conditions. Considering the high likelihood of healthy and moderately salt-impacted forests becoming highly salt-impacted forests under future climate change and sea-level rise, it is very likely that the TFFW will lose their capacity as carbon sinks without up-slope migration.

TI  - Exotic Spartina alterniflora invasion alters ecosystem-atmosphere exchange of CH4 and N2O and carbon sequestration in a coastal salt marsh in China
AB  - Coastal salt marshes are sensitive to global climate change and may play an important role in mitigating global warming. To evaluate the impacts of Spartina alterniflora invasion on global warming potential (GWP) in Chinese coastal areas, we measured CH4 and N2O fluxes and soil organic carbon sequestration rates along a transect of coastal wetlands in Jiangsu province, China, including open water; bare tidal flat; and invasive S. alterniflora, native Suaeda salsa, and Phragmites australis marshes. Annual CH4 emissions were estimated as 2.81, 4.16, 4.88, 10.79, and 16.98kg CH(4)ha(-1) for open water, bare tidal flat, and P. australis, S. salsa, and S. alterniflora marshes, respectively, indicating that S. alterniflora invasion increased CH4 emissions by 57-505\%. In contrast, negative N2O fluxes were found to be significantly and negatively correlated (P<0.001) with net ecosystem CO2 exchange during the growing season in S. alterniflora and P. australis marshes. Annual N2O emissions were 0.24, 0.38, and 0.56kg N(2)Oha(-1) in open water, bare tidal flat and S. salsa marsh, respectively, compared with -0.51kg N(2)Oha(-1) for S. alterniflora marsh and -0.25kg N(2)Oha(-1) for P. australis marsh. The carbon sequestration rate of S. alterniflora marsh amounted to 3.16 Mg Cha(-1)yr(-1) in the top 100cm soil profile, a value that was 2.63- to 8.78-fold higher than in native plant marshes. The estimated GWP was 1.78, -0.60, -4.09, and -1.14Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1)yr(-1) in open water, bare tidal flat, P. australis marsh and S. salsa marsh, respectively, but dropped to -11.30Mg CO(2)eqha(-1)yr(-1) in S. alterniflora marsh. Our results indicate that although S. alterniflora invasion stimulates CH4 emissions, it can efficiently mitigate increases in atmospheric CO2 and N2O along the coast of China.

TI  - Effect of petroleum hydrocarbons in copper phytoremediation by a salt marsh plant (Juncus maritimus) and the role of autochthonous bioaugmentation
AB  - This work aimed to investigate, under controlled but environmental relevant conditions, the effects of the presence of both inorganic and organic contaminants (copper and petroleum hydrocarbons) on phytoremediation potential of the salt marsh plant Juncus maritimus. Moreover, bioaugmentation, with an autochthonous microbial consortium (AMC) resistant to Cu, was tested, aiming an increase in the remediation potential of this plant in the presence of a co-contamination. Salt marsh plants with sediment attached to their roots were collected, placed in vessels, and kept in greenhouses, under tidal simulation. Sediments were contaminated with Cu and petroleum, and the AMC was added to half of the vessels. After 5 months, plants accumulated significant amounts of Cu but only in belowground structures. The amount of Cu was even higher in the presence of petroleum. AMC addition increased Cu accumulation in belowground tissues, despite decreasing Cu bioavailability, promoting J. maritimus phytostabilization potential. Therefore, J. maritimus has potential to phytoremediate co-contaminated sediments, and autochthonous bioaugmentation can be a valuable strategy for the recovery and management of moderately impacted estuaries. This approach can contribute for a sustainable use of the environmental resources.

TI  - No Detectable Broad-Scale Effect of Livestock Grazing on Soil Blue-Carbon Stock in Salt Marshes
AB  - Grassland carbon capturing and storage (CCS) is thought to benefit from regulation of grazing. The impact is likely to depend on livestock density. Yet, few studies have tested this principle or evaluated the consistency of grazer-carbon relationships across multiple sites. We sampled four intertidal zones across 22 salt marshes along a 650 km stretch of coast in the UK to examine the impact of livestock density on globally important saltmarsh ``blue carbon{''} stocks. Although there were marked impacts of grazing pressure on above ground vegetation composition, structure and biomass, there was no detectable relationship between grazing intensity and soil organic carbon, irrespective of tidal zone in the marsh or soil depth-layer analyzed. A substantial spatial variation in soil carbon was instead explained by contextual environmental variables. There was evidence that compensatory responses by vegetation, such as increased root growth, countered carbon loss from grazing impacts. Our work suggests that grazing effects on carbon stocks are minimal on broader scales in comparison with the influence of environmental context. The benefits of grazing management to carbon stores are likely to be highly context dependent.

AB  - Feedbacks between plant biomass density and sedimentation maintain intertidal marshes in equilibrium with mean sea level (MSL). Stable marshes exist at an elevation that is supraoptimal for the biomass density of marsh macrophytes. At this elevation, biomass density is sensitive to changes in MSL, and adjustments in productivity and sedimentation rate help to maintain the marsh in a dynamic equilibrium with sea level, provided that the surface elevation remains within the supraoptimal range of the vegetation. The equilibrium elevation varies inversely with the rate of sea-level rise and directly with biomass density. It was also shown that a succession of intertidal plant communities depends upon the rate of sea level rise and the distribution of biomass density as a function of hydroperiod. Soft engineering solutions to coastal flooding could incorporate planting of marsh vegetation in the intertidal zone for the purpose of promoting sedimentation and dissipating wave energy. A successful design would employ plant species that have varying degrees of tolerance to flooding, maximum drag at their preferred depths, broad ranges within the intertidal zone, and that form a successional series.

TI  - The horizontal levee: a multi -benefit nature-based treatment system that improves water quality and protects coastal levees from the effects of sea level rise
AB  - Municipal wastewater treatment plants in coastal areas are facing numerous challenges, including the need to provide a cost-effective approach for removing nutrients and trace organic contaminants from wastewater, as well as adapting to the effects of climate change. The horizontal levee is a multi-benefit response to these issues that consists of a sloped subsurface treatment wetland built between a coastal levee and tidal marshes. The wetland attenuates storm surges and can provide space for wetland transgression to higher elevations as sea levels rise, while simultaneously removing contaminants from treated wastewater effluent. To assess the ability of the horizontal levee to improve water quality and to identify optimal operating conditions, a 0.7-ha experimental system was studied over a two-year period. The removal of nitrate and trace organic contaminants was particularly sensitive to hydrology; rapid and near complete removal (>97\%) of these contaminants was observed in water flowing through the subsurface, whereas surface flows did not exhibit measurable contaminant removal. Removal of Fthorn coliphage also appeared to be sensitive to hydrology, with up to 99\% removal of these indicator viruses in subsurface flow. For phosphate, removal was not as sensitive to hydrology, but significant removal (>83\%) was still observed when overland flow was eliminated. Although removal of contaminants did not appear to be sensitive to other design considerations, parameters such as soil texture and planting regimes affected the maximum subsurface flows, which in turn controlled contaminant mass loadings. Rapid subsurface removal of contaminants suggests that water quality benefits of these systems are limited by physical constraints (i.e., the ability of the system to maintain subsurface flow) and not chemical or biological conditions in the subsurface.

TI  - Best practice for upscaling soil organic carbon stocks in salt marshes
AB  - Calculating the amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) stored in coastal environments, including salt marshes, is needed to determine their role in mitigating the Climate Crisis. Several techniques exist to calculate the SOC content of a unit of land from the upscaling of soil cores. However, no comprehensive assessment has been made on the performance of commonly used SOC upscaling techniques until now. We measured the SOC content of soil cores gathered from two Scottish salt marshes. Two SOC values were used for upscaling; SOC content for a 1 m standardised depth (as recommended by the IPCC), and SOC content of the modern marsh deposit (identified in the stratigraphy as a transition from organic-rich (marsh) to mineral-rich (intertidal flat) soil. Twenty-two upscaling techniques were used (SOC content Ã— area, interpolative, and regression-based extrapolative calculations). Leave-one-out cross-validation procedures and prediction interval widths were used to assess the accuracy of each technique. Digital Terrain Models and Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices were used as covariate surfaces in the regression models. We found that marsh-scale SOC stocks varied by as much as fifty-two times depending on which sampling depth and upscaling technique was used. The largest differences emerged when comparing SOC stocks upscaled from 1 m deep and modern marsh deposits. Using the IPCC recommended 1 m sampling depth inflated the SOC stocks of salt marshes, as intertidal flat environments were included in the calculation. Ensemble regression models from the weighted average of seven machine learning algorithm outputs produced the highest upscaling accuracies across marshes and sampling depths. Simple SOC content Ã— area calculations produced marsh-scale SOC stocks that were comparable to stock values produced by more advanced ensemble regression models. However, regression models produced detailed maps of SOC distribution across a marsh, and the associated uncertainty in the SOC values. Our findings are broadly applicable for other environments where large-scale SOC stock assessments and uncertainty are needed. Â© 2022

TI  - Exotic Spartina alterniflora invasion increases CH4 while reduces CO2 emissions from mangrove wetland soils in southeastern China
AB  - Mangroves are critical in global carbon budget while vulnerable to exotic plant invasion. Spartina alterniflora, one of typical salt marsh plant grows forcefully along the coast of China, has invaded the native mangrove habitats in Zhangjiang Estuary. However, the effects of S. alterniflora invasion on soil carbon gases (CH4 and CO2) emission from mangroves are not fully understood. Accordingly, we conducted a field experiment to investigate the soil CH4 and CO2 emission during growing seasons in 2016 and 2017 at four adjacent wetlands, namely bare mudflat (Mud), Kandelia obovata (KO), Avicennia marina (AM) and S. alterniflora (SA). Potential methane production (PMP), potential methane oxidation (PMO), functional microbial abundance and soil biogeochemical properties were measured simultaneously. Our results indicate that S. alterniflora invasion could dramatically increase soil CH4 emissions mainly due to the enhancement in PMP which facilitated by soil EC, MBC, TOC and mcrA gene abundance. Additionally, S. alterniflora invasion decreases soil CO2 emission. Both heterotrophic microbial respiration (165 rRNA) and methane oxidation (pmoA and ANME-pmoA) are responsible for CO2 emission reduction. Furthermore, S. alterniflora invasion greatly increases GWP by stimulating CH4 emissions. Thus, comparing with mangroves, invasive S. alterniflora significantly (p < 0.001) increases CH4 emission while reduces CO2 emission.

TI  - Enrichment of salt-tolerant CO2â€“fixing communities in microbial electrosynthesis systems using porous ceramic hollow tube wrapped with carbon cloth as cathode and for CO2 supply
AB  - Microbial inocula from marine origins are less explored for CO2 reduction in microbial electrosynthesis (MES) system, although effective CO2â€“fixing communities in marine environments are well-documented. We explored natural saline habitats, mainly salt marsh (SM) and mangrove (M) sediments, as potential inoculum sources for enriching salt-tolerant CO2 reducing community using two enrichment strategies: H2:CO2 (80:20) enrichment in serum vials and enrichment in cathode chamber of MES reactors operated at âˆ’1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Porous ceramic hollow tube wrapped with carbon cloth was used as cathode and for direct CO2 delivery to CO2 reducing communities growing on the cathode surface. Methanogenesis was dominant in both the M- and SM-seeded MES and the methanogenic Archaea Methanococcus was the most dominant genus. Methane production was slightly higher in the SM-seeded MES (4.9 Â± 1.7 mmol) compared to the M-seeded MES (3.8 Â± 1.1 mmol). In contrast, acetate production was almost two times higher in the M-seeded MES (3.1 Â± 0.9 mmol) than SM-seeded MES (1.5 Â± 1.3 mmol). The high relative abundance of the genus Acetobacterium in the M-seeded serum vials correlates with the high acetate production obtained. The different enrichment strategies affected the community composition, though the communities in MES reactors and serum vials were performing similar functions (methanogenesis and acetogenesis). Despite similar operating conditions, the microbial community composition of M-seeded serum vials and MES reactors differed from the SM-seeded serum vials and MES reactors, supporting the importance of inoculum source in the evolution of CO2-reducing microbial communities.

TI  - Variability of soil organic carbon reservation capability between coastal salt marsh and riverside freshwater wetland in Chongming Dongtan and its microbial mechanism
AB  - Two representative zones in Chongming Dongtan which faced the Yangtze River and East China Sea respectively were selected to study the variability of soil organic carbon (SOC) reservation capability between coastal wetland and riverside wetland in the Chongming Dongtan wetland as well as its mechanism by analyzing soil characteristics and plant biomass. The results showed the SOC content of riverside wetland was only 48.61\% (P = 0.000 < 0.05) that of coastal wetland. As the organic matter inputs from plant litter of the coastal wetland and riverside wetland were approximately the same, the higher soil microbial respiration (SMR) of riverside wetland led to its lower SOC reservation capability. In the riverside wetland, the high soil microbial biomass, higher proportion of beta-Proteobacteria, which have strong carbon metabolism activity and the existence of some specific aerobic heterotrophic bacteria such as Bacilli and uncultured Lactococcus, were the important reasons for the higher SMR compared to the coastal wetland. There were additional differences in soil physical and chemical characteristics between the coastal wetland and riverside wetlands. Path analysis of predominant bacteria and microbial biomass showed that soil salinity influenced beta-Proteobacteria and microbial biomass most negatively among these physical and chemical factors. Therefore the low salinity of the riverside area was suitable for the growth of microorganisms, especially beta-Proteobacteria and some specific bacteria, which led to the high SMR and low SOC reservation capability when compared to the coastal area.

TI  - The role of soil as a carbon sink in coastal salt-marsh and agropastoral systems at La Pletera, NE Spain
AB  - To evaluate the potential of natural and modified salt-marsh soils to store organic carbon and their soil properties, we investigated six soil environments located at La Pletera salt-marsh area, NE Spain. Namely, Ruderal (RU), rubbles over marsh for construction purpose, ELY covered by Elymus elymoides (Raf.) meadows, ART under Arthrocnemum fruticosum L., SAL under Salicornia patula Duval Jouve, AGR under Zea mays L., and AME under Medicago sativa L. as artificial meadow. Soils were sampled at three depths (0â€“5, 5â€“20 and 20â€“40 cm). At 0â€“5 cm depth, soil organic carbon (SOC) was higher in ART soil (40.08 g kgâˆ’1) with respect to ELY, AME, AGR, SAL and RU (23.63, 11.45, 5.77, 4.40 and 3.18 g kgâˆ’1 respectively). Glomalin (TGRSP) in ART had the same trend, with 8.88 g kgâˆ’1 decreased by 51%, 77%, 89%, 92% and 94% in ELY, AME, AGR, SAL and RU soil respectively, indicating that in ART recalcitrant organic carbon may prevail. ART and ELY soils had higher SOC and GRSP than AGR and AME soils at 0â€“5 and 5â€“20 cm (on average + 70% and 57%) but SOC values were similar at 20â€“40 cm depth and glomalin was even higher in AGR and AME soils at this depth suggesting migration of stable organic compounds in cultivated soils. The water stable aggregates (WSA) analysed in the 0.25â€“2 mm and 2â€“5.6 mm fractions was also higher in ART and ELY soils (â‰ˆ90%) at 0â€“5 and 5â€“20 cm with respect to the other investigated soils. Higher WSA (fraction 0.25â€“5 mm) was found in AGR and AME soils at 20â€“40 cm corroborating that at higher GRSP corresponds higher aggregation. Potential carbon loss as C-CO2 (Mg haâˆ’1) was evaluated at 0â€“5 cm depth and was much lower in ART soil. Accordingly, C-CO2/SOC ratio assigned to ART soil 1.85% of SOC loss against 8.26%, 11.64%, 18.90%, 20.37% and 22.72% of ELY, AME, RU, SAL and AGR soils respectively, indicating that only ART and ELY soils may exert clear carbon sequestration ability. The soil under annual Salicornia patula Duval Jouve (SAL) showed very low SOC (4.40 g kgâˆ’1) and the highest carbon loss potential (22.72%) due to shortage of organic decaying debris at surface. Also, C-TGRSP resulted higher in ELY and ART soils (2.51 and 1.31 Mg ha-1respectively) and C-TGRSP/SOC ratio demonstrated glomalin carbon enrichment in this order: ART &gt; AME &gt; ELY &gt; AGR &gt; SAL &gt; RU, suggesting that carbon sequestration capacity may be assigned to ART and ELY soils, major carbon sinks in the Pletera salt-marsh area. Conversely, RU, AGR and AME soils, identified as ancient salt-marsh converted into agropastoral systems or altered for tourism purposes showed worse soil properties and higher sensitivity to carbon destabilization. Statistical treatment of data by factor analysis corroborated the obtained results outlining the importance of ART and ELY soils in maintaining best soil properties and the highest carbon storage capacity.

TI  - Co-Regulations of Spartina alterniflora Invasion and Exogenous Nitrogen Loading on Soil N2O Efflux in Subtropical Mangrove Mesocosms
AB  - Both plant invasion and nitrogen (N) enrichment should have significant impact on mangrove ecosystems in coastal regions around the world. However, how N2O efflux in mangrove wetlands responds to these environmental changes has not been well studied. Here, we conducted a mesocosm experiment with native mangrove species Kandelia obovata, invasive salt marsh species Spartina alterniflora, and their mixture in a simulated tide rotation system with or without nitrogen addition. In the treatments without N addition, the N2O effluxes were relatively low and there were no significant variations among the three vegetation types. A pulse loading of exogenous ammonium nitrogen increased N2O effluxes from soils but the stimulatory effect gradually diminished over time, suggesting that frequent measurements are necessary to accurately understand the behavior of N-induced response of N2O emissions. With the N addition, the N2O effluxes from the invasive S. alterniflora were lower than that from native K. obovata mesocosms. This result may be attributed to higher growth of S. alterniflora consuming most of the available nitrogen in soils, and thus inhibiting N2O production. We concluded that N loading significantly increased N2O effluxes, while the invasion of S. alterniflora reduced N2O effluxes response to N loading in this simulated mangrove ecosystem. Thus, both plant invasion and excessive N loading can co-regulate soil N2O emissions from mangrove wetlands, which should be considered when projecting future N2O effluxes from this type of coastal wetland.

TI  - Organic carbon fractions in temperate mangrove and saltmarsh soils
AB  - Coastal wetlands, such as mangrove and saltmarsh environments, can store significant amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC); however, most studies focus on tropical and subtropical environments. We assessed SOC stocks and fractions in temperate mangrove (two sites) and saltmarsh (sites SM1, SM2 and SM3) environments in southern Australia. The SOC fractions were separated according to particulate organic carbon (POC), humic carbon (HC) and recalcitrant carbon (RC) by size fractionation. Saltmarsh sites generally had the highest SOC content (up to 12.4% SOC). The POC fraction was the highest at the surface in the saltmarsh site and decreased relative to the HC and RC fractions with depth. Conversely, the proportion of POC at the mangrove sites did not decrease with depth, forming up to 76% of the SOC. The vertical displacement of soil of up to 5.8 mm year-1 at the saltmarsh sites, measured using root ingrowth bags, suggest significant contributions of POC via root materials. Retention of these POC inputs are likely to be related to waterlogging, which decreases decomposition rates-with much lower soil moisture content at SM1, where the lowest POC content occurred below the surface, compared with SM2 and SM3.

TI  - Biomass equations and carbon content of aboveground leafless biomass of hybrid poplar in Coastal British Columbia
AB  - Hybrid poplar plantations offer opportunities for enhancing carbon sinks, but accurate assignment of carbon credits requires accurate estimation of the amount of carbon stored in poplar biomass. Here we present individual-tree bole and branch biomass equations derived for Populus trichocarpa Torr. and Gray x P. deltoides Marsh. hybrids from plantations in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Trees ranged in age from 4 to 13 years old and were planted at a density of 1111 stems ha-1. Equations were applied to similar short-rotation intensive-culture plantations near or at rotation age to derive estimates of aboveground leafless biomass production and amount of carbon sequestered. After 12 years, predicted aboveground leafless biomass accumulation ranged from 9.2 to 13.6 Mg ha-1 year-1; predicted bole biomass accumulation ranged from 7.5 to 11.3 Mg ha-1 year-1. Total carbon in aboveground leafless biomass at age 12 ranged from 51.2 to 75.7 Mg ha -1. Three of the stands reached 14 years of age prior to harvest. Predicted carbon content of aboveground leafless biomass at 14 years of age ranged from 73.7 to 88.7 Mg ha-1. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Estimating the gaseous carbon budget of a degraded tidal wetland
AB  - Wetlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle but are intensively disturbed by humans. Estimating the gaseous carbon budget of degraded wetlands has great significance for wetland conservation. The Shanyutan wetland is a degraded tidal wetland in Southeast China. We compared the landscape patterns of Shanyutan in 2009 and 2019 based on remote sensing images and determined the sediment CO2 flux (excluding root respiration) in various land types. We combined the sediment CO2 flux with the wetland CH4 flux, and the CH4 and CO2 fluxes of aquaculture ponds, as well as net plant carbon sequestration (NPCS) from previous studies, and calculated the gaseous carbon budget of Shanyutan for the 10-year period. Our results show that the areas of aquaculture ponds and mudflats increased over the 10-year period, whereas those of vegetated marsh and sand decreased. Determination of the sediment CO2 flux indicates that sediment CO2 flux is higher in vegetated marsh and lower in bare land, with the highest annual flux in Spartina alterniflora marsh and the lowest in sand. The gaseous carbon budget shows that aquaculture ponds and bare land are sources of atmospheric carbon, whereas vegetated marsh serves as a sink. The entire wetland was an atmospheric carbon sink in 2009, with a carbon sequestration rate of 1364.4 tCÂ·aâˆ’1; however, it became a source in 2019 due to destruction, with a carbon efflux of 1072.6 tCÂ·aâˆ’1. Moreover, the gaseous carbon balance in Shanyutan had a climate-warming potential, with an equivalent CO2 production of 5971.8 tÂ·aâˆ’1 in 2009, and this potential increased ~9 times over the 10-year period. Finally, we conclude that restoring the carbon cycle of Shanyutan has considerable future economic value. Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Incorporation of uncertainty to improve projections of tidal wetland elevation and carbon accumulation with sea-level rise
AB  - Understanding the rates and patterns of tidal wetland elevation changes relative to sea-level is essential for understanding the extent of potential wetland loss over the coming years. Using an enhanced and more flexible modeling framework of an ecosystem model (WARMER-2), we explored sea-level rise (SLR) impacts on wetland elevations and carbon sequestration rates through 2100 by considering plant community transitions, salinity effects on productivity, and changes in sediment availability. We incorporated local experimental results for plant productivity relative to inundation and salinity into a species transition model, as well as site-level estimates of organic matter decomposition. The revised modeling framework includes an improved calibration scheme that more accurately reconstructs soil profiles and incorporates parameter uncertainty through Monte Carlo simulations. Using WARMER-2, we evaluated elevation change in three tidal wetlands in the San Francisco Bay Estuary, CA, USA along an estuarine tidal and salinity gradient with varying scenarios of SLR, salinization, and changes in sediment availability. We also tested the sensitivity of marsh elevation and carbon accumulation rates to different plant productivity functions. Wetland elevation at all three sites was sensitive to changes in sediment availability, but sites with greater initial elevations or space for upland transgression persisted longer under higher SLR rates than sites at lower elevations. Using a multi-species wetland vegetation transition model for organic matter contribution to accretion, WARMER-2 projected increased elevations relative to sea levels (resilience) and higher rates of carbon accumulation when compared with projections assuming no future change in vegetation with SLR. A threshold analysis revealed that all three wetland sites were likely to eventually transition to an unvegetated state with SLR rates above 7 mm/yr. Our results show the utility in incorporating additional estuary-specific parameters to bolster confidence in model projections. The new WARMER-2 modeling framework is widely applicable to other tidal wetland ecosystems and can assist in teasing apart important drivers of wetland elevation change under SLR.

TI  - Plant microbial fuel cell applied in wetlands: Spatial, temporal and potential electricity generation of Spartina anglica salt marshes and Phragmites australis peat soils
AB  - The plant microbial fuel cell (PMFC) has to be applied in wetlands to be able to generate electricity on a large scale. The objective of this PMFC application research is to clarify the differences in electricity generation between a Spartina anglica salt marsh and Phragmites australis peat soil based on experimental data and theoretical calculated potential. PMFC in salt marsh generated more than 10 times more power than the same PMFC in peat soil (18 vs 1.3 mW m-2 plant growth area). The salt marsh reached a record power output for PMFC technology per cubic meter anode: 2.9 W m-3. Most power is generated in the top layer of the salt marsh due to the presence of the plants and the tidal advection. The potential current generation for the salt marsh is 0.21-0.48 A m-2 and for peat soil 0.15-0.86 A m-2. PMFC technology is potentially able to generate a power density up to 0.52 W m-2, which is more than what is generated for biomass combustion or anaerobic digestion using the same plant growth area.

TI  - Research progresses in carbon budget and carbon cycle of the coastal salt marshes in China
AB  - Due to its higher primary productivities and lower carbon decomposition rates, the coastal salt marsh can be as an efficient sink to reduce global warming by sequestering carbon. In recent years, the researches on the function of coastal salt marshes on global climate change have been paid more attention. As an important part of global carbon budget, the research on carbon cycle in the coastal salt marshes will be useful to understand the global carbon cycle and global climate change, and can also provide scientific basis for the use of the coastal salt marshes as a carbon sink to reduce carbon emission. The distribution of the Chinese coastal salt marshes is widespread, and it plays an important role in global change. In this paper, the research progresses on carbon budget and carbon cycle of the coastal salt marshes in China were analyzed and summarized from five aspects, i. e., the observation methods of carbon cycle, processes and characteristics of carbon budget and cycle, carbon pools and their influencing factors, input and output of gaseous carbon, and the tidal effect on coastal salt marsh carbon budget. The results suggested that carbon cycle in the coastal salt marshes included outer cycle (i. e., carbon input and output) and inner cycle (i. e., mineralization and carbon storage). The monitoring methods for each system of the wetland carbon cycle were quite different. The common methods mainly included eddy covariance method, box method and stable isotope method. The primary way of carbon output in the coastal salt marshes was soil and plant respiration releasing CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere and it was mainly influenced by tidal and soil temperature. Vegetation and soils as the two most important carbon pools for the coastal salt marshes were mainly dependent on vegetation types, invasive alien plants, anthropogenic activities and tidal effect. Besides, tidal effect also was the main factor affecting carbon budget in the coastal salt marshes through direct physical transport. In conclusion, tidal effect was the common and dominant factor affecting both carbon cycle and budget in the coastal salt marshes. Although there have been so many researches on the biogeochemical characteristics of carbon in the coastal salt marshes, but it is deficient in accurately quantifying the carbon sequestration potential of the coastal salt marshes. Thus, there are several suggestions for the future researches on carbon budget and cycle in the coastal salt marshes put forward as follows: (1) to strengthen both the extensive and intensive researches on carbon pools in the coastal salt marshes; (2) to standard the quantization and observation methods of carbon storages and fluxes; (3) to enhance the long-term field observation and laboratory experiments; and (4) to quantify the carbon exchange fluxes between the coastal salt marshes and other adjacent ecosystems. Consequently, the more accurate assessment and long-term monitoring on carbon budget in the coastal salt marshes should be performed before the further understanding of impact of the coastal salt marshes on and its feedback roles in global climate changes, which have important significance to predicting global change and developing the promotion strategy in reserve function of wetland carbon.

TI  - Carbon Sources in the Sediments of a Restoring vs. Historically Unaltered Salt Marsh
AB  - Salt marshes provide the important ecosystem service of carbon storage in their sediments; however, little is known about the sources of such carbon and whether they differ between historically unaltered and restoring systems. In this study, stable isotope analysis was used to quantify carbon sources in a restoring, sparsely vegetated marsh (Restoring) and an adjacent, historically unaltered marsh (Reference) in the Nisqually River Delta (NRD) of Washington, USA. Three sediment cores were collected at ``Inland{''} and ``Seaward{''} locations at both marshes similar to 6 years after restoration. Benthic diatoms, C3 plants, C4 plants, and particulate organic matter (POM) were collected throughout the NRD. delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of sources and sediments were used in a Bayesian stable isotope mixing model to determine the contribution of each carbon source to the sediments of both marshes. Autochthonous marsh C3 plants contributed 73 +/- 10\% (98 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and 89 +/- 11\% (119 g C m(-2) year(-1)) to Reference-Inland and Reference-Seaward sediment carbon sinks, respectively. In contrast, the sediment carbon sink at the Restoring Marsh received a broad assortment of predominantly allochthonous materials, which varied in relative contribution based on source distance and abundance. Marsh POM contributed the most to Restoring-Seaward (42 +/- 34\%) (69 g C m(-2) year(-1)) followed by Riverine POM at Restoring-Inland (32 +/- 41\%) (52 g C m(-2) year(-1)). Overall, this study demonstrates that largely unvegetated, restoring marshes can accumulate carbon by relying predominantly on allochthonous material, which comes mainly from the most abundant and closest estuarine sources.

TI  - Sediment, carbon and vegetation dynamics in an estuarine wetland of the Hunter estuary, NSW
AB  - In the Hunter estuary of NSW, as in most of south eastern Australia, estuarine wetlands typically comprise intertidal mudflats at the seaward margin, followed up the topographic gradient by dense mangrove forest, with saltmarsh plains landwards of these mangroves stands. Both saltmarsh and mangrove forest are important carbon sinks, and provide unique habitats for fish and many terrestrial species. Saltmarsh is particularly critical as roosting habitat for shorebirds, and a decline in saltmarsh habitat, in part due to mangrove encroachment associated with changing estuary water levels, has been observed in the estuary. The present research aimed at establishing the effects of flow manipulation in Area E of Kooragang Island, an important roosting site that has been subject to tidal reinstatement in 1995. We analysed accretion rates, carbon capture and vegetation distribution evolution as a result of these changes in order to support ongoing restoration efforts on the site. The methodology consisted of a combination of field data collection, laboratory experiments, statistical analysis and numerical hydrodynamic simulation. Results show that tidal reinstatement resulted in general increased accretion and carbon sequestration rates, and a continuous encroachment of mangrove into saltmarsh areas. Based on these results, a mangrove exclusion program through tidal hydraulic manipulation at the wetland inlet has been proposed. Â© 2012 Engineers Australia.

TI  - Soil carbon sequestration in coastal freshwater wetlands of Veracruz [Secuestro de carbono en suelos de humedales costeros de agua dulce en Veracruz]
AB  - Wetlands play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle because they act as sinks of this element. Vegetation in the wetlands is a factor that influences C storage in these ecosystems. We investigated C storage in freshwater wetland soils with different types of vegetation (swamps and marshes) in the coastal plain of Veracruz, Mexico. The study sites were: Estero Dulce (ED), Tecolutla and Laguna Chica (LCH), Vega de Alatorre. Bulk densities observed ranged from 0.1 to 1.15 g cm3. Average C stored in LCH was higher in swamp (13.30Â±0.11 %) than in marsh soils (4.52Â±0.02 %). However, in ED the C content was similar in swamp (5.88Â±0.03 %) and marsh soils (5.28Â±0.02 %). In LCH marshes, there was approximately 50 % less total C in the soil compared to the C content in the swamps. In ED, the C stored in the marshes was only 7.15 % lower than the C stored in the swamps. When the total C storage of freshwater swamps (35.04Â±4.0 kg cm-2) and marshes (24.8Â±4.0 kg cm-2) was compared, there was no effect caused by the type of vegetation (P = 0.213).

TI  - Ecosystem type drives tea litter decomposition and associated prokaryotic microbiome communities in freshwater and coastal wetlands at a continental scale
AB  - Wetland ecosystems are critical to the regulation of the global carbon cycle, and there is a high demand for data to improve carbon sequestration and emission models and predictions. Decomposition of plant litter is an important component of ecosystem carbon cycling, yet a lack of knowledge on decay rates in wetlands is an impediment to predicting carbon preservation. Here, we aim to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying the decomposition of standardised green and rooibos tea litter over one year within freshwater and coastal wetland soils across four climates in Australia. We also captured changes in the prokaryotic members of the tea-associated microbiome during this process. Ecosystem type drove differences in tea decay rates and prokaryotic microbiome community composition. Decomposition rates were up to 2-fold higher in mangrove and seagrass soils compared to freshwater wetlands and tidal marshes, in part due to greater leaching-related mass loss. For tidal marshes and freshwater wetlands, the warmer climates had 7â€“16% less mass remaining compared to temperate climates after a year of decomposition. The prokaryotic microbiome community composition was significantly different between substrate types and sampling times within and across ecosystem types. Microbial indicator analyses suggested putative metabolic pathways common across ecosystems were used to breakdown the tea litter, including increased presence of putative methylotrophs and sulphur oxidisers linked to the introduction of oxygen by root in-growth over the incubation period. Structural equation modelling analyses further highlighted the importance of incubation time on tea decomposition and prokaryotic microbiome community succession, particularly for rooibos tea that experienced a greater proportion of mass loss between three and twelve months compared to green tea. These results provide insights into ecosystem-level attributes that affect both the abiotic and biotic controls of belowground wetland carbon turnover at a continental scale, while also highlighting new decay dynamics for tea litter decomposing under longer incubations.

TI  - System-specific complex interactions shape soil organic carbon distribution in coastal salt marshes
AB  - Coastal wetlands provide many critical ecosystem services including carbon storage. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is the most important component of carbon stock in coastal salt marshes. However, there are large uncertainties when estimating SOC stock in coastal salt marshes at large spatial scales. So far, information on the spatial heterogeneity of SOC distribution and determinants remains limited. Moreover, the role of complex ecological interactions in shaping SOC distribution is poorly understood. Here, we report detailed field surveys on plant, soil and crab burrowing activities in two inter-tidal salt marsh sites with similar habitat conditions in Eastern China. Our between-site comparison revealed slight differences in SOC storage and a similar vertical SOC distribution pattern across soil depths of 0âˆ’60 cm. Between the two study sites, we found substantially different effects of biotic and abiotic factors on SOC distribution. Complex interactions involving indirect effects between soil, plants and macrobenthos (crabs) may influence SOC distribution at a landscape scale. Marked differences in the SOC determinants between the study sites indicate that the underlying driving mechanisms of SOC distribution are strongly system-specific. Future work taking into account complex interactions and spatial heterogeneity is needed for better estimating of blue carbon stock and dynamics. Â© 2020 by the authors.

TI  - A remote sensing-based model of tidal marsh aboveground carbon stocks for the conterminous United States
AB  - Remote sensing based maps of tidal marshes, both of their extents and carbon stocks, have the potential to play a key role in conducting greenhouse gas inventories and implementing climate mitigation policies. Our objective was to generate a single remote sensing model of tidal marsh aboveground biomass and carbon that represents nationally diverse tidal marshes within the conterminous United States (CONUS). We developed the first calibration-grade, national-scale dataset of aboveground tidal marsh biomass, species composition, and aboveground plant carbon content (\%C) from six CONUS regions: Cape Cod, MA, Chesapeake Bay, MD, Everglades, FL, Mississippi Delta, LA, San Francisco Bay, CA, and Puget Sound, WA. Using the random forest machine learning algorithm, we tested whether imagery from multiple sensors, Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar, Landsat, and the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP), can improve model performance. The final model, driven by six Landsat vegetation indices and with the soil adjusted vegetation index as the most important (n = 409, RMSE = 310 g/m2, 10.3\% normalized RMSE), successfully predicted biomass for a range of marsh plant functional types defined by height, leaf angle and growth form. Model results were improved by scaling field-measured biomass calibration data by NAIP-derived 30 m fraction green vegetation. With a mean plant carbon content of 44.1\% (n = 1384, 95\% C.I. = 43.99\%-44.37\%), we generated regional 30 m aboveground carbon density maps for estuarine and palustrine emergent tidal marshes as indicated by a modified NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program map. We applied a multivariate delta method to calculate uncertainties in regional carbon densities and stocks that considered standard error in map area, mean biomass and mean \%C. Louisiana palustrine emergent marshes had the highest C density (2.67 +/- 0.004 Mg/ha) of all regions, while San Francisco Bay brackish/saline marshes had the highest C density of all estuarine emergent marshes (2.03 +/- 0.004 Mg/ha). Estimated C stocks for predefined jurisdictional areas ranged from 1023 +/- 39 Mg in the Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in Washington to 507,761 +/- 14,822 Mg in the Terrebonne and St. Mary Parishes in Louisiana. This modeling and data synthesis effort will allow for aboveground C stocks in tidal marshes to be included in the coastal wetland section of the U.S. National Greenhouse Gas Inventory. With the increased availability of free post-processed satellite data, we provide a tractable means of modeling tidal marsh aboveground biomass and carbon at the global extent as well.

TI  - Carbon offsetting? blue carbon provides opportunities for the dredging industry
AB  - Coastal ecosystems with high carbon sequestration capacity disappear at a high rate, often causing the release of large amounts of stored carbon into the atmosphere. This paper defines the different forms of carbon that play a role in the context of climate change. Of particular interest is 'blue carbon', which is the term used for carbon captured and stored by the oceans and the coastal ecosystems. The global carbon cycle and the role of carbon storage are summarised. This is necessary in order to understand the very significant role of blue carbon in climate change mitigation. The carbon storage capacity of coastal biotopes, (seagrass beds, mangrove forests, marshes, wetlands, etc.) is extremely high. The paper provides global scale estimates for the specific carbon uptake of each of these valuable biotopes, their loss rate during the past 50 years, as well as estimates for the areas remaining. Based on these data the paper warns against further loss of coastal ecosystems and pleads for habitat restoration where possible (United Nations Environment Programme). The second part of the paper provides an estimate of the annual CO2 emissions of the global dredging fleet and compares this figure with the area of coastal habitats necessary to sequester such an amount. In the concluding section the paper explores the possible role of dredging-related activities in restoring coastal habitats in view of offsetting global CO2 emissions of the dredging fleet.

TI  - Effect of conversion of coastal marsh into aquaculture ponds on ecosystem carbon stocks in the Min River estuary [æ»¨æµ·æ²¼æ³½æ¹¿åœ°è½¬åŒ–ä¸ºå…»æ®–å¡˜å¯¹å…¶ç¢³å‚¨é‡çš„å½±å“]
AB  - In order to scientifically assess the impact of land use/land cover changes on blue carbon pool of coastal tidal marsh, it is valuable to determine the changes of ecosystem carbon stock following conversion of coastal marsh to aquaculture ponds. In the Minjiang River estuary zone, we collected the samples of the aboveground and belowground plants, and the soils (0~100cm) from the Phragmites australis, Cyperus malatensis and Spartina alterniflora marshes, and the top 100cm sediment of the aquaculture ponds reclaimed from above three different marshes. The organic carbon content of plants, and soil / sediment samples were measured. The blue carbon storage of P.australis marsh ecosystem, C.malaccensis marsh ecosystem and S.alterniflora marsh ecosystem was (152.85Â±8.88), (151.63Â±6.33), and (155.85Â±10.82)Mg C/hm2, respectively, and the sediment carbon storage of the aquaculture ponds was (112.69Â±4.26), (128.24Â±15.81), and (118.59Â±8.26)Mg C/hm2, respectively. The blue carbon storage of P.australis marsh ecosystem, C.malaccensis marsh ecosystem and S.alterniflora marsh ecosystem decreased by 26.3%, 15.4%, and 23.9%, respectively, resulting in (145.49Â±33.00), (120.66Â±26.49), and (136.76Â±27.61)Mg CO2-eq/hm2 carbon emissions. Our results showed that conversion of coastal marsh into aquaculture ponds greatly decreased ecosystem carbon storage. We suggested that ecological restoration of aquaculture pond into marsh ecosystem will play an important role in coastal wetland carbon sequestration.

TI  - Oyster reefs as carbon sources and sinks
AB  - Carbon burial is increasingly valued as a service provided by threatened vegetated coastal habitats. Similarly, shellfish reefs contain significant pools of carbon and are globally endangered, yet considerable uncertainty remains regarding shellfish reefsâ€™ role as sources (+) or sinks (-) of atmospheric CO2. While CO2 release is a by-product of carbonate shell production (then burial), shellfish also facilitate atmospheric-CO2 drawdown via filtration and rapid biodeposition of carbon-fixing primary producers. We provide a framework to account for the dual burial of inorganic and organic carbon, and demonstrate that decade-old experimental reefs on intertidal sandflats were net sources of CO2 (7.1 Â± 1.2 MgC ha-1 yr-1 (m Â± s.e.)) resulting from predominantly carbonate deposition, whereas shallow subtidal reefs (-1.0 Â± 0.4 MgC ha-1 yr-1) and saltmarsh-fringing reefs (-1.3 Â± 0.4 MgC ha-1 yr-1) were dominated by organic-carbon-rich sediments and functioned as net carbon sinks (on par with vegetated coastal habitats). These landscape-level differences reflect gradients in shellfish growth, survivorship and shell bioerosion. Notably, down-core carbon concentrations in 100- to 4000-year-old reefs mirrored experimental-reef data, suggesting our results are relevant over centennial to millennial scales, although we note that these natural reefs appeared to function as slight carbon sources (0.5 Â± 0.3 MgC ha-1 yr-1). Globally, the historical mining of the top metre of shellfish reefs may have reintroduced more than 400 000 000 Mg of organic carbon into estuaries. Importantly, reef formation and destruction do not have reciprocal, counterbalancing impacts on atmospheric CO2 since excavated organic material may be remineralized while shell may experience continued preservation through reburial. Thus, protection of existing reefs could be considered as one component of climate mitigation programmes focused on the coastal zone. Â© 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

TI  - Accelerated sea-level rise is suppressing CO2 stimulation of tidal marsh productivity: A 33-year study
AB  - Accelerating relative sea-level rise (RSLR) is threatening coastal wetlands. However, rising CO2 concentrations may also stimulate carbon sequestration and vertical accretion, counterbalancing RSLR. A coastal wetland dominated by a C3 plant species was exposed to ambient and elevated levels of CO2 in situ from 1987 to 2019 during which time ambient CO2 concentration increased 18% and sea level rose 23 cm. Plant production did not increase in response to gradually rising ambient CO2 concentration during this period. Elevated CO2 increased shoot production relative to ambient CO2 for the first two decades, but from 2005 to 2019, elevated CO2 stimulation of production was diminished. The decline coincided with increases in relative sea level above a threshold that hindered root productivity. While elevated CO2 stimulation of elevation gain has the potential to moderate the negative impacts of RSLR on tidal wetland productivity, benefits for coastal wetland resilience will diminish in the long term as rates of RSLR accelerate.

TI  - Tidal marsh restoration enhances sediment accretion and carbon accumulation in the Stillaguamish River estuary, Washington
AB  - Tidal marshes have been recognized globally for their ability to sequester â€œblue carbonâ€ but there is still a need for studies investigating the marsh response to restoration, particularly in the Pacific Northwest United States. Here we report carbon stocks and accumulation rates for restored and natural tidal marshes in the Stillaguamish River estuary in Puget Sound, Washington, where a 60-hectare marsh was reintroduced to the tidal regime from its previous use as diked and drained farmland. We found that the restoration not only maximized carbon accumulation but also enhanced resilience to rising sea levels. Four years after restoration, mean sediment carbon stocks in the upper 30 cm within the restored marsh (4.43 kg C m-2) were slightly lower than those measured in the adjacent natural marshes (5.95 kg C m-2). Mean carbon accumulation rates, however, were nearly twice as high in the restored marsh (230.49 g C m-2 yr-1) compared to the natural marshes (123.00 g C m-2 yr-1) due to high rates of accretion in the restored marsh (1.57 cm yr-1). Mean elevation change rates were nearly twice that of corresponding 210Pb accretion rates, but all were greater than the current rate of sea level rise. Copyright: Â© 2021 Poppe, Rybczyk.

TI  - Coastal Blue Carbon Assessment of Mangroves, Salt Marshes, and Salt Barrens in Tampa Bay, Florida, USA
AB  - Compared to other terrestrial environments, coastal ``blue carbon{'' habitats such as salt marshes and mangrove forests sequester disproportionately large amounts of carbon as standing plant biomass and peat deposits. This study quantified organic carbon stocks in 16 salt marshes, salt barrens, and mangrove forests in Tampa Bay, Florida, USA. The sites included natural, restored, and created wetlands of varying ages and degrees of anthropogenic impacts. Peat deposits were generally less than 30-cm deep and organic content rapidly decreased with depth in all habitats. The top 15 cm of mangrove soil contained an average of 11.0\% organic carbon by weight, salt marshes contained 6.6\%, and salt barrens contained 1.0\%. Total organic carbon stock in mangroves was 133.6 +/- 12.8 Mg ha(-1), with 69.5\% of that carbon stored belowground. Salt marshes contained 66.4 +/- 25.0 Mg ha(-1) (93.5\% belowground carbon), and salt barrens contained 26.6 +/- 8.3 Mg ha(-1) (96.1\% belowground carbon). These values were much lower than global averages for carbon stocks in mangroves and salt marshes, likely due to Tampa Bay's location near the northern limit of mangrove habitat, sandy soil, young age of the restored wetlands, presence of mosquito ditches, and recent habitat conversion from salt marshes to mangroves. In the late 1800s, Tampa Bay's coastal wetlands were dominated by salt marshes, but today they are dominated by mangroves. Based on the blue carbon values from the natural sites in this study, this habitat switching has led to the additional sequestration of 141,000 Mg of carbon in remaining wetlands in the Tampa Bay watershed.

TI  - Dynamics of labile soil organic carbon during the development of mangrove and salt marsh ecosystems
AB  - Labile fractions of soil carbon pools are sensitive to environmental changes, which would influence the stabilization of soil carbon. However, it is unclear whether the dynamics of labile organic carbon (LOC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) are coupled and how they influence each other in coastal wetland. The present work investigated the trends of soil carbon fractions among mangrove and Spartina alterniflora communities with different stand ages (1, 5, 10, and 15 years), at Quanzhou Bay Estuary Wetland Nature Reserve, China. We found that SOC in a mangrove ecosystem increased over time, while there was no significant trend in S. alterniflora dominated ecosystems. The highest LOC of mangrove appeared in 5-year-old communities, and then decreased with stand age. In S. alterniflora communities, content of labile fractions increased with the stand age. These trends indicated different soil carbon dynamics when comparing mangrove and S. alterniflora ecosystems. The development of mangroves promoted accumulation of recalcitrant carbon, while S. alterniflora ecosystems contributed to an increase of labile carbon. This phenomenon is probably caused by the characteristics of vegetation and the hydrological conditions. Mangroves contribute more refractory organic carbon to the soil carbon pool, while accumulation of LOC in S. alterniflora communities may inhibit the stabilization of SOC. Our study on the relationship of LOC and SOC implies that complex interactions occur among soil carbon pools and environmental conditions in coastal wetlands, suggesting soil carbon models should take into account decoupled dynamics of LOC and SOC.

TI  - Component greenhouse gas fluxes and radiative balance from two deltaic marshes in Louisiana: Pairing chamber techniques and eddy covariance
AB  - Coastal marshes take up atmospheric CO2 while emitting CO2, CH4, and N2O. This ability to sequester carbon (C) is much greater for wetlands on a per area basis than from most ecosystems, facilitating scientific, political, and economic interest in their value as greenhouse gas sinks. However, the greenhouse gas balance of Gulf of Mexico wetlands is particularly understudied. We describe the net ecosystem exchange (NEEc) of CO2 and CH4 using eddy covariance (EC) in comparison with fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O using chambers from brackish and freshwater marshes in Louisiana, USA. From EC, we found that 182gCm(-2)yr(-1) was lost through NEEc from the brackish marsh. Of this, 11g Cm(-2)yr(-1) resulted from net CH4 emissions and the remaining 171gCm(-2)yr(-1) resulted from net CO2 emissions. In contrast, -290gCm(2)yr(-1) was taken up through NEEc by the freshwater marsh, with 47gCm(-2)yr(-1) emitted as CH4 and -337gCm(-2)yr(-1) taken up as CO2. From chambers, we discovered that neither site had large fluxes of N2O. Sustained-flux greenhouse gas accounting metrics indicated that both marshes had a positive (warming) radiative balance, with the brackish marsh having a substantially greater warming effect than the freshwater marsh. That net respiratory emissions of CO2 and CH4 as estimated through chamber techniques were 2-4 times different from emissions estimated through EC requires additional understanding of the artifacts created by different spatial and temporal sampling footprints between techniques.

TI  - Incorporating blue carbon sequestration benefits into sub-national climate policies
AB  - The emissions reduction pledges made by individual countries through the 2015 Paris Agreement represent the current global commitment to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in the face of the enduring climate crisis. Natural lands carbon sequestration and storage are critical for successful pathways to global decarbonization (i.e., as a negative emissions technology). Coastal vegetated habitats maintain carbon sequestration rates exceeding forest sequestration rates on a per unit area basis by nearly two orders of magnitude. These blue carbon habitats and their associated carbon sequestration benefits are vulnerable to losses from land-use change and sea-level rise. Incorporation of blue carbon habitats in climate change policy is one strategy for both maintaining these habitats and conserving significant carbon sequestration capabilities. Previous policy assessments have found the potential for incorporation of coastal carbon sequestration in national-level policies, yet there has â€“ to date â€“ been little inclusion of blue carbon in the national-scale implementation of Paris commitments. Recently, sub-national jurisdictions have gained attention as models for pathways to decarbonization. However, few previous studies have examined sub-national level policy opportunities for operationalizing blue carbon into climate decision-making. California is uniquely poised to integrate benefits from blue carbon into its coastal planning and management and its suite of climate mitigation policies. Here, we evaluated legal authorities and policy contexts addressing sequestration specifically from blue carbon habitats. We synthesized the progressive action in California's approaches to mitigate carbon emissions including statutory, regulatory, and non-regulatory opportunities to incorporate blue carbon ecosystem service information into state- and local-level management decisions. To illustrate how actionable blue carbon information can be produced for use in decision-making, we conducted a spatial analysis of blue carbon sequestration in several locations in California across multiple agencies and management contexts. We found that the average market values of carbon sequestration services in 2100 ranged from $7,730 to $44,000 per hectare and that the social cost of carbon sequestration value was 1.3 to 2.7 times the market value. We also demonstrated that restoration of small areas with high sequestration rates can be comparable to the sequestration of existing marshes. Our results illustrate how accessible information about carbon sequestration in coastal habitats can be directly incorporated into existing policy frameworks at the sub-national scale. The incorporation of blue carbon sequestration benefits into sub-national climate policies can serve as a model for the development of future policy approaches for negative emissions technologies, with consequences for the success of the Paris Agreement and science-based decarbonization by mid-century.

TI  - Carbon-rich substrates altered microbial communities with indication of carbon metabolism functional shifting in a degraded salt marsh of the Yellow River Delta, China
AB  - Coastal salt marshes have been significantly suffering degradation worldwide, turning these wetlands from carbon sink to carbon source. The additions of carbon-rich substrates in degraded coastal wetlands have been documented to alleviate this situation; however, the microbial responses as well as their carbon metabolisms to the input are not well explored. Here, we investigated the effects of different addition levels (0.1\%, 1\%, and 3\%) of reed straw and biochar addition on microbial communities (bacteria and fungi) and predicted functions of carbon metabolism in degraded coastal salt marshes. The effects of the carbon-rich substrates on microbial communities are more pronounced under 3\% of reed straw and biochar than other levels, straw increased opportunistic bacteria (e.g., Bacillus and Cellvibrionaceae) and biochar increased low carbon turnover bacteria (e. g., Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria). The addition of higher doses of reed straw and biochar promoted the carbon metabolism of soil bacteria as predicted by the PICRUSt 2. Interestingly, the addition of reed straw increased the abundance involved in fungal carbon metabolism, but this was not the case for the biochar input. The addition of reed straw and biochar promoted the growth of some bacteria (e.g., Rhizobiales and Bacillus) that are beneficial to plant growth, and decreased some fungal pathogen (e.g., Magnaporthaceae and Phaeosphaeria). Our findings revealed that the carbon-rich substrates addition can reshape the microbial structure and shift their carbon metabolisms, specially, biochar has a higher potential to improve the ecosystem services, such as blue carbon sequestration, of these degraded coastal salt marshes.

TI  - Modeled CO2 Emissions from Coastal Wetland Transitions to Other Land Uses: Tidal Marshes, Mangrove Forests, and Seagrass Beds
AB  - The sediments of coastal wetlands contain large stores of carbon which are vulnerable to oxidation once disturbed, resulting in high levels of CO2 emissions that may be avoided if coastal ecosystems are conserved or restored. We used a simple model to estimate CO2 emissions from mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and tidal marshes based on known decomposition rates for organic matter in these ecosystems under either oxic or anoxic conditions combined with assumptions of the proportion of sediment carbon being deposited in either oxic or anoxic environments following a disturbance of the habitat. Our model found that over 40 years after disturbance the cumulative CO2 emitted from tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass beds were 70-80\% of the initial carbon stocks in the top meter of the sediment. Comparison of our estimates of CO2 emissions with empirical studies suggests that (1) assuming 50\% of organic material moves to an oxic environment after disturbance gives rise to estimates that are similar to CO2 emissions reported for tidal marshes; (2) field measurements of CO2 emissions in disturbed mangrove forests were generally higher than our modeled emissions that assumed 50\% of organic matter was deposited in oxic conditions, suggesting higher proportions of organic matter may be exposed to oxic conditions after disturbance in mangrove ecosystems; and (3) the generally low observed rates of CO2 emissions from disturbed seagrasses compared to our estimates, assuming removal of 50\% of the organic matter to oxic environments, suggests that lower proportions may be exposed to oxic conditions in seagrass ecosystems. There are significant gaps in our knowledge of the fate of wetland sediment carbon in the marine environment after disturbance. Greater knowledge of the distribution, form, decomposition, and emission rates of wetland sediment carbon after disturbance would help to improve models.

TI  - Climate-related variation in plant peak biomass and growth phenology across Pacific Northwest tidal marshes
AB  - The interannual variability of tidal marsh plant phenology is largely unknown and may have important ecological consequences. Marsh plants are critical to the biogeomorphic feedback processes that build estuarine soils, maintain marsh elevation relative to sea level, and sequester carbon. We calculated Tasseled Cap Greenness, a metric of plant biomass, using remotely sensed data available in the Landsat archive to assess how recent climate variation has affected biomass production and plant phenology across three maritime tidal marshes in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. First, we used clipped vegetation plots at one of our sites to confirm that tasseled cap greenness provided a useful measure of aboveground biomass (r(2) = 0.72). We then used multiple measures of biomass each growing season over 20-25 years per study site and developed models to test how peak biomass and the date of peak biomass varied with 94 climate and sea-level metrics using generalized linear models and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) model selection. Peak biomass was positively related to total annual precipitation, while the best predictor for date of peak biomass was average growing season temperature, with the peak 7.2 days earlier per degree C. Our study provides insight into how plants in maritime tidal marshes respond to interannual climate variation and demonstrates the utility of time-series remote sensing data to assess ecological responses to climate stressors.

TI  - Blue carbon in area-based coastal and marine management schemesâ€“a review
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems are diverse and highly productive coastal habitats (mangroves, seagrasses, and tidal marshes) that sequester large quantities of carbon and provide a suite of important ecosystem services (â€˜co-benefitsâ€™) for humans and the environment. These ecosystems are being threatened globally due to land-use change driven by expanding agriculture, aquaculture, coastal development, and pollution. Climatic impacts further threaten the resilience, functionality, and adaptability of blue carbon ecosystems. â€˜Marine protected areasâ€™ (MPAs) provide a statutory approach for protecting coastal and marine ecosystems, yet are unlikely to meet â€˜additionalityâ€™ requirements. Whereas other effective conservation measures (OECMs) including community-based â€˜locally managed marine areasâ€™ (LMMAs) provide opportunities to enhance blue carbon conservation and restoration efforts. LMMAs likely deliver additional sequestration, although ensuring â€˜permanenceâ€™ of carbon stocks may be more difficult to achieve. This review summarizes key approaches of blue carbon monitoring; governance systems; policy instruments; and investment pathways for conservation and restoration.

TI  - Variation in ecosystem carbon dynamics of saltwater marshes in the northern Gulf of Mexico
AB  - Wetlands are highly productive ecosystems that can sequester large quantities of carbon. However, variation in physiological potential can alter their capacity to sequester carbon. To examine variation in ecosystem physiological capacity, we established three coastal marsh sites in Mississippi and Alabama spanning a productivity gradient. Over 1Â year, we measured ecophysiological activity and spectral indices in two vegetation zones within each marsh to develop a better understanding of variation in ecosystem responses and health. Gross ecosystem exchange of carbon and ecosystem respiration rates (Reco) differed significantly among sites, with the highest activity at Grand Bay, Mississippi and Point Aux Pines, Alabama and lower ecophysiological activity at Dauphin Island, Alabama. Net ecosystem exchange was similar for all three study areas because greater carbon assimilation was negated by higher levels of respiration. Spectral indices and leaf area were significantly different by marsh vegetation zone, suggesting that alterations in species composition and plant productivity can have important implications for carbon sequestration. While limited to 1Â year, this study establishes a foundation by which to evaluate future research conducted over greater temporal and spatial scales, thereby enhancing our understanding of marsh physiological activity.

TI  - What happens to soil organic carbon as coastal marsh ecosystems change in response to increasing salinity? An exploration using ramped pyrolysis
AB  - Coastal wetlands store vast amounts of organic carbon, globally, and are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the effects of anthropogenic sea level rise. To understand the effect of sea level rise on organic carbon fate and preservation in this global sink, it is necessary to characterize differences in the biogeochemical stability of coastal wetland soil organic carbon (SOC). Here we use ramped pyrolysis/oxidation decomposition characteristics as proxies for SOC stability to understand the fate of carbon storage in coastal wetlands comprising the Mississippi River deltaic plain, undergoing rapid rates of local sea level rise. Soils from three wetland types (fresh, brackish, and salt marshes) along a salinity gradient were subjected to ramped pyrolysis analysis to evaluate decomposition characteristics related to thermochemical stability of SOC. At equivalent soil depths, we observed that fresh marsh SOC was more stable than brackish and salt marsh SOC. Depth, isotopic, elemental, and chemical compositions, bulk density, and water content of SOC all exhibited different relationships with SOC stability across the marsh salinity gradient, indicative of different controls on SOC stability within each marsh type. The differences in stability imply stronger preservation potential of fresh marsh soil carbon, compared to that of salt and brackish marshes. Considering projected marsh ecosystem responses to sea level rise, these observed stability differences are important in planning and implementing coastal wetland carbon-focused remediation and improving climate model feedbacks with the carbon cycle. Specifically, our results imply that ecosystem changes associated with sea level rise will initiate the accumulation of less stable carbon in coastal wetlands. Â© 2015. American Geophysical Union.

TI  - The role of bio-geomorphic feedbacks in shaping microplastic burial in blue carbon habitats
AB  - Coastal sediments are considered as hotspots of microplastics (MPs), with substantial MPs stocks found in blue carbon habitats such as mangroves and tidal marshes, where wave-damping vegetation reduces sediment erosion and en-hances accretion. Here, we examined the effects of such bio-geomorphic feedbacks in shaping MPs burial, through a year-round field study in a mangrove habitat along the coast of South China. The results revealed that MPs abundance decreased significantly with the increase of cumulative sediment erosion as the strength of bio-geomorphic feedbacks declined. More shapes and colors of MPs were found at locations with weaker waves and less sediment erosion, where the average particle size was also higher. Our findings highlight the importance of bio-geomorphic feedbacks in affect-ing both the abundance and characteristics of the buried MPs. Such knowledge extends our understanding of MPs transport and burial from the perspective of bio-geomorphology, which is essential to assess and predict MPs accumu-lation patterns as well as its impacts on ecosystem functioning of the blue carbon habitats.

TI  - What do we need to assess the sustainability of the tidal salt marsh carbon sink?
AB  - Tidal salt marshes provide a range of ecosystem services. The most recently recognized is their provision of highly effective sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide, a characteristic they share with mangroves swamps which largely replace salt marshes in the intertidal zones of tropical regions. Efforts are emerging to use salt marsh preservation or restoration in carbon offset programs, similar to the REDD initiative for tropical forests, but a number of issues first must be addressed to determine if a site meets the requirements of these programs. As intertidal systems, both salt marshes and mangrove swamps are threatened by increasing rates of sea level rise, and it will be essential to determine their sustainability, thus meeting the requirement of permanence of the carbon sink. In many areas the vegetation responsible for marsh soil accretion may not survive increased flooding periods, resulting in submergence of the marsh in its present location or inability to restore a marsh at its previous elevation. However, the marsh and its carbon sink, may survive if allowed to migrate inland. Thus assessment of permanence requires a determination if inland migration will be hindered by barriers such as high slopes or development, i.e., if the ecosystem is in a coastal squeeze. Presently, the only technology that can provide elevation models at the required vertical accuracy is Lidar, which also is extremely valuable for assessing vulnerability of coastal communities to flooding. Yet, Lidar data is not available for all coastlines, even those in the developed world. To effectively plan for the future of our coastlines requires Lidar coverage on all sensitive coastlines and its free availability for impact assessments. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Beyond habitat boundaries: Organic matter cycling requires a system-wide approach for accurate blue carbon accounting
AB  - As coastal ecosystems become widely recognized for their capacity to sequester carbon (blue carbon), standard accounting methodologies for the generation of carbon credits are being developed. To ensure the applicability of these standards across blue carbon ecosystems, we investigated organic carbon provenance and burial in salt marshes and seagrass meadows of an arid, upwelling-dominated Eastern Pacific lagoon. We found low carbon density in benthic sediments of Bahia de San Quintin (5.9 +/- 0.5 mg C cm(-3)), only marginally higher in Zostera marina beds (6.9 +/- 0.5 mg C cm(-3)), likely due to remineralization and hydrodynamically driven export of seagrass material, resulting in low carbon burial rates (4.5 +/- 2.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Sediment organic carbon is mainly controlled by the fraction of fine sediment and its source is largely allochthonous, although sources differ spatially. Salt marshes at San Quintin derive 40\% of their organic matter from autochthonous material and exhibit higher carbon burial rates (up to 414.7 +/- 28.6 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and sediment carbon densities (32.0 +/- 0.7 mg C cm(-3)) compared to benthic sediments. This study emphasizes the connectivity of blue carbon habitats with marsh plant detritus supplementing benthic carbon burial and incorporation of detrital eelgrass in marsh sediments. Our findings highlight the importance of allochthonous organic matter for carbon sequestration in blue carbon habitats, suggesting standard accounting practices that deduct allochthonous organic matter would miss the full potential for carbon burial.

TI  - Updated estimates of carbon accumulation rates in coastal marsh sediments
AB  - Studies on carbon stock in salt marsh sediments have increased since the review by Chmura et al. (2003). However, uncertainties exist in estimating global carbon storage in these vulnerable coastal habitats, thus hindering the assessment of their importance. Combining direct data and indirect estimation, this study compiled studies involving 143 sites across the Southern and Northern hemispheres, and provides an updated estimate of the global average carbon accumulation rate (CAR) at 244.7 g Cm-2 yr(-1) in salt marsh sediments. Based on region-specific CAR and estimates of salt marsh area in various geographic regions between 40 degrees S to 69.7 degrees N, total CAR in global salt marsh sediments is estimated at similar to 10.2 Tg C yr(-1). Latitude, tidal range and elevation appear to be important drivers for CAR of salt marsh sediments, with considerable variation among different biogeographic regions. The data indicate that while the capacity for carbon sequestration by salt marsh sediments ranked the first amongst coastal wetland and forested terrestrial ecosystems, their carbon budget was the smallest due to their limited and declining global areal extent. However, some uncertainties remain for our global estimate owing to limited data availability.

TI  - Contemporary Rates of Carbon Sequestration Through Vertical Accretion of Sediments in Mangrove Forests and Saltmarshes of South East Queensland, Australia
AB  - Mangrove forests and saltmarshes are important habitats for carbon (C) sequestration in the coastal zone but variation in rates of C sequestration and the factors controlling sequestration are poorly understood. We assessed C sequestration in Moreton Bay, South East Queensland in mangrove forests and tidal marshes that span a range of environmental settings and plant communities, including mangrove forests and tidal marshes on the oligotrophic sand islands of the eastern side of Moreton Bay and on the nutrient enriched, western side of the bay adjacent to the city of Brisbane. We found that rates of C sequestration in sediments were similar among mangrove forests over the bay, despite large differences in the C density of sediments, because of different rates of vertical accretion of sediments. The C sequestration on the oligotrophic sand island tidal marshes, dominated by Juncus kraussii, had the highest rate of C sequestration in the bay while the western saltmarshes, which were dominated by Sarcocornia quinqueflora, had the lowest rate of C sequestration. Our data indicate C sequestration varies among different tidal wetland plant community types, due to variation in sediment characteristics and rates of sediment accretion over time.

TI  - Australian vegetated coastal ecosystems as global hotspots for climate change mitigation
AB  - Policies aiming to preserve vegetated coastal ecosystems (VCE; tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrasses) to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions require national assessments of blue carbon resources. Here, we present organic carbon (C) storage in VCE across Australian climate regions and estimate potential annual CO2 emission benefits of VCE conservation and restoration. Australia contributes 5-11\% of the C stored in VCE globally (70-185 Tg C in aboveground biomass, and 1,055-1,540 Tg C in the upper 1 m of soils). Potential CO2 emissions from current VCE losses are estimated at 2.1-3.1 Tg CO2-e yr(-1), increasing annual CO2 emissions from land use change in Australia by 12-21\%. This assessment, the most comprehensive for any nation to-date, demonstrates the potential of conservation and restoration of VCE to underpin national policy development for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Salinity Affects Topsoil Organic Carbon Concentrations Through Regulating Vegetation Structure and Productivity
AB  - Estuarine salt marshes have been recognized as one of the most efficient carbon sinks in the biosphere, with considerable potential for climate change mitigation. However, there are still uncertainties about the response of soil carbon stocks to enhanced soil salinization caused by accelerated sea-level rises and aggravated saltwater intrusion. We therefore conducted both field investigations in the Chongming Dongtan salt marsh of the Yangtze River Estuary, China, and manipulative experiments on marsh soils occupied, respectively, by the invasive Spartina alterniflora, and the native Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter, to identify the effects of elevated soil salinity on top soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration. Our field data showed that SOC concentrations were significantly positively associated with soil salinity concentrations, annual net primary productivity, and marsh surface elevation but showed a significant negative relationship with median grain size. Compared with the two native species, S. alterniflora preferred more saline conditions and had a higher SOC concentration. Although raised flooding salinities (0-35 ppt) did not strongly affect SOC concentrations, elevated soil salinities significantly corresponded with low SOC concentrations and plant biomass in manipulative experiments. These findings indicated that soil salinity, plant species, and soil texture were key factors controlling SOC concentrations in the studied salt marsh. Moreover, soil salinity could affect SOC concentrations through regulating vegetation spatial structure and plant biomass production. The further invasion of the S. alterniflora community will exert a positive influence on SOC concentrations in the Chongming Dongtan salt marsh.

TI  - Assessing the feasibility of carbon payments and Payments for Ecosystem Services to reduce livestock grazing pressure on saltmarshes
AB  - Saltmarshes provide important services including flood control, climate regulation, and provisioning services when grazed by livestock for agriculture and conservation purposes. Grazing diminishes aboveground carbon, creating a trade-off between these two services. Furthermore, saltmarshes are threatened by overgrazing. To provide saltmarsh protection and ensure the continuing delivery of ecosystem services, there is a need to incentivise land managers to stock environmentally sensible densities. We therefore investigated the possibility of agri-environmental schemes and Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) to compensate for lost livestock revenue under reduced grazing regimes and provide carbon sequestration and other benefits. This is the first study to consider the benefits arising from a potential carbon market to saltmarshes, although similar schemes exist for peatland and woodland. We calculated the net economic benefit (costs of livestock production are removed from revenue) to farmers obtained from a hectare of grazed saltmarsh under low (0.3 Livestock Units per hectare per year), moderate (0.6), high (1.0) and very high (2.0) stocking densities accounting for livestock revenue, carbon benefits, and agri-environmental subsidies. We repeated the procedure considering additional benefits transferred from the literature in terms of provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services provided by protected saltmarshes. The net benefits were assessed for a range of market carbon prices and social costs of carbon, e.g. the opportunity cost of carbon for society. Applying the model to Scottish saltmarshes we find that the current range of market prices could prompt transitions from high to moderate regimes in areas where livestock value is low, however break-even prices for transitions showed high spatial variability due to spatial variability in livestock values. In some areas of the West Highlands, the break-even carbon price is negative, indicating that the current agri-environmental schemes are able to more than compensate for the lost revenue accruing to farmers by a reduced grazing density. However, in other areas, such as the Outer Hebrides, the break-even carbon price is positive. Private PES schemes or increased public subsidies should then be provided to generate net benefits. It is reasonable to infer that a pure carbon market may have limited scope in incentivising consumers to buy carbon services, especially in areas with limited local number of buyers and corporates of small size. Under this circumstance, a premium carbon market offering bundled ecosystem services may help reduce grazing pressure across a larger number of Scottish saltmarshes, thereby providing globally important climate regulation services and at the same time protecting sensitive habitats.

TI  - Changes in Soil Organic Carbon Dynamics in a Native C-4 Plant-Dominated Tidal Marsh Following Spartina alterniflora Invasion
AB  - Invasion of an exotic C-4 plant Spartina alterniflora has been shown to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations in native C-3 plant-dominated coastal wetlands of China. However, little is known about the effects of S. alterniflora invasion on SOC concentrations and fractions in tidal marshes dominated by native C-4 plants. In this study, a field experiment was conducted in a tidal marsh dominated by the native C-4 plant Cyperus malaccensis in the Minjiang River estuary, China. Concentrations of SOC and liable SOC fractions, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and easily oxidizable carbon (EOC), were measured in the top 50-cm soils of the C. malaccensis community, as well as those of three S. alterniflora communities with an invasion duration of 0-4 years (SA-4), 4-8 years (SA-8), and 8-12 years (SA-12), respectively. Results showed that both SOC stocks in the 50-cm soils and mean SOC concentrations in the surface soils (0-10 cm) of the C. malaccensis community increased with the duration of S. alterniflora invasion, whereas SOC concentrations in the 10-50-cm soils decreased slightly during the initial period of S. alterniflora invasion, before increasing again. The pattern of changes in labile SOC fractions (DOC, MBC, and EOC) with invasion duration was generally similar to that of SOC, while the ratios of labile SOC fractions to total SOC (DOC:SOC, MBC:SOC, and EOC:SOC) decreased significantly with the duration of S. alterniflora invasion. The findings of this study suggest that invasion of the exotic C-4 plant S. alterniflora into a marsh dominated by the native C-4 plant C. malaccensis would enhance SOC sequestration owing to the greater amount of biomass and lower proportion of labile SOC fractions present in the S. alterniflora communities.

TI  - Major role of marine vegetation on the oceanic carbon cycle
AB  - The carbon burial in vegetated sediments, ignored in past assessments of carbon burial in the ocean, was evaluated using a bottom-up approach derived from upscaling a compilation of published individual estimates of carbon burial in vegetated habitats (seagrass meadows, salt marshes and mangrove forests) to the global level and a top-down approach derived from considerations of global sediment balance and a compilation of the organic carbon content of vegeatated sediments. Up-scaling of individual burial estimates values yielded a total carbon burial in vegetated habitats of 111 Tmol C y(-1). The total burial in unvegetated sediments was estimated to be 126 Tg C y(-1), resulting in a bottom-up estimate of total burial in the ocean of about 244 Tg C y(-1), two-fold higher than estimates of oceanic carbon burial that presently enter global carbon budgets. The organic carbon concentrations in vegetated marine sediments exceeds by 2 to 10-fold those in shelf/deltaic sediments. Top-down recalculation of ocean sediment budgets to account for these, previously neglected, organic-rich sediments, yields a top-down carbon burial estimate of 216 Tg C y(-1), with vegetated coastal habitats contributing about 50\%. Even though vegetated carbon burial contributes about half of the total carbon burial in the ocean, burial represents a small fraction of the net production of these ecosystems, estimated at about 3388 Tg C y(-1), suggesting that bulk of the benthic net ecosystem production must support excess respiration in other compartments, such as unvegetated sediments and the coastal pelagic compartment. The total excess organic carbon available to be exported to the ocean is estimated at between 1126 to 3534 Tg C y(-1), the bulk of which must be respired in the open ocean. Widespread loss of vegetated coastal habitats must have reduced carbon burial in the ocean by about 30 Tg Cy-1, identifying the destruction of these ecosystems as an important loss of CO2 sink capacity in the biosphere.

TI  - Dominance bySpartina densifloraslows salt marsh litter decomposition
AB  - Questions Coastal vegetated systems are known to play a fundamental role in climate change mitigation as a result of their efficiency sequestering and storing atmospheric CO2. While most of the work evaluating carbon sequestration capacity has focused on global change factors that can affect carbon release from plant litter decomposition through changes in (large-scale) environmental conditions, less is known about the possible effects of the loss (or replacement) of dominant species. We hypothesized that dominant marsh plants can influence decomposition not only through changes in litter quality but also through changes in (microscale) soil environmental conditions such as humidity, soil temperature or solar radiation. Location We performed a field manipulative experiment in a southwestern (SW) Atlantic salt marsh in Argentina. Methods We simulate a selective disturbance (i.e., removal of the dominant grass speciesSpartina densiflora) thus allowing removal plots to develop an alternative plant community. To evaluate the effect of the dominant grass species on litter decomposition, in an experiment we performed a litterbag approach three years after the establishment of the removal plots. Results Results showed that the presence ofS. densiflorasignificantly decreased litter decomposition directly by producing less labile litter, but also by effects that seem to be related to its structure as standing dominant vegetation. The experimental removal ofS. densifloraled to an alternative plant community, formed by otherwise subordinate species, which is less densely packed, allowing higher radiation incidence on the soil and elevated midday soil temperature. Conclusions Our results suggest that salt marsh litter decomposition, and thus C sequestration, is determined in part by the identity of the dominant plant, not only because of the quality of the produced litter but also as a consequence of the vegetation structure . Changes in species diversity, above all changes in the dominant species in these coastal systems, could have large impacts on the carbon turnover and mitigation capacity of these ecosystems.

TI  - Effect of reclamation on soil organic carbon pools in coastal areas of eastern China
AB  - The coastal wetlands of eastern China form one of the most important carbon sinks in the world. However, reclamation can significantly alter the soil carbon pool dynamics in these areas. In this study, a chronosequence was constructed for four reclamation zones in Rudong County, Jiangsu Province, eastern China (reclaimed in 1951, 1974, 1982, and 2007) and a reference salt marsh to identify both the process of soil organic carbon (SOC) evolution, as well as the effect of cropping and soil properties on SOC with time after reclamation. The results show that whereas soil nutrient elements and SOC increased after reclamation, the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract (ECe), pH, and bulk density decreased within 62 years following reclamation and agricultural amendment. In general, the soil's chemical properties remarkably improved and SOC increased significantly for approximately 30 years after reclamation. Reclamation for agriculture (rice and cotton) significantly increased the soil organic carbon density (SOCD) in the top 60 cm, especially in the top 0-30 cm. However, whereas the highest concentration of SOCD in rice-growing areas was in the top 0-20 cm of the soil profile, it was greater at a 20-60 cm depth in cottongrowing areas. Reclamation also significantly increased heavy fraction organic carbon (HFOC) levels in the 0-30 cm layer, thereby enhancing the stability of the soil carbon pool. SOC can thus increase significantly over a long time period after coastal reclamation, especially in areas of cultivation, where coastal SOC pools in eastern China tend to be more stable.

TI  - An Assessment of the Tea Bag Index Method as a Proxy for Organic Matter Decomposition in Intertidal Environments
AB  - Intertidal wetlands capture and store carbon (C) for long periods of time, helping to reduce the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Yet the processes, which govern the decomposition and subsequent long-term storage of organic matter (OM) and C in these habitats, remain poorly understood. The Tea Bag Index (TBI) uses a standardized OM (green and Rooibos tea) and has the potential to shed light on OM decomposition across habitats, including saltmarshes. Here, we apply the TBI method at two saltmarshes within the same estuary with the aim of (i) reducing the influence of climatic variables and (ii) determining the role of the environment, including the soil characteristics, in the decomposition of OM. We extended the standard (3 months) incubation period over a full year in order to investigate the longer-term decomposition processes at each site. The initial results partially support previous studies that the early stages of decomposition (leaching of the water-soluble fraction) is governed by climatic conditions, but may be further enhanced by tidal flushing in saltmarshes. By extending the incubation period, we observed the initiation of midstage OM decomposition (cellulose degradation) upon which the soil characteristics appear to be the dominant control. These results highlight the importance of long-term TBI incubations to understand early-stage OM decomposition. The relationship between tea mass (OM) loss and C loss in these intertidal environments is not straightforward, and we would caution the use of the TBI as a direct universal proxy for soil C degradation in such intertidal wetlands.

TI  - Soil organic carbon stocks in a tidal marsh landscape are dominated by human marsh embankment and subsequent marsh progradation
AB  - Tidal marshes are coastal and estuarine ecosystems that store large amounts of sedimentary organic carbon (OC). Despite the valuable ecosystem services they deliver, tidal marshes have been converted to other land-use types over the past centuries. Although previous studies have reported large decreases in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks after tidal marsh embankment, knowledge on the magnitude and rate of OC losses is still limited. Here, we studied the effect of stepwise embankments of brackish and salt marshes and subsequent marsh progradation on SOC stocks in the Scheldt estuary (the Netherlands). We collected samples from soil profiles along tidal marshâ€“reclaimed tidal marsh chronosequences and determined total OC stocks and the stable carbon signature of the OC. Our results showed that large losses of previously sequestered SOC occur on a decadal timescale with the embankment of brackish (âˆ’8.7 Â± 0.7 kg OC m âˆ’2 ) and salt marshes (âˆ’6.7 Â± 0.8 kg OC m âˆ’2 ). The (incomplete) replacement of tidal marsh OC by agricultural OC is substantially faster in topsoils (ca. a century) compared with subsoils (multiple centuries). Simulations with a coupled land useâ€“SOC model showed that large rates of marsh progradation following embankment construction resulted in a substantial increase in landscape-scale SOC storage, whereas large SOC losses occurred in landscapes dominated by embanked tidal marshes. The findings of our study might help to assess how these management practices affect regional SOC stocks. Highlights: We studied how OC stocks in tidal marsh sediments are affected by embankment construction OC stocks of both brackish and salt marsh sediments were reduced by ca. 60% with embankment Gains in landscape-scale SOC storage occurred with marsh progradation after embankment If no marsh progradation occurs, embankments always lead to SOC loss at the landscape scale.

TI  - Current and future carbon stocks in coastal wetlands within the Great Barrier Reef catchments
AB  - Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR) catchments include some of the world's most intact coastal wetlands comprising diverse mangrove, seagrass and tidal marsh ecosystems. Although these ecosystems are highly efficient at storing carbon in marine sediments, their soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and the potential changes resulting from climate impacts, including sea level rise are not well understood. For the first time, we estimated SOC stocks and their drivers within the range of coastal wetlands of GBR catchments using boosted regression trees (i.e. a machine learning approach and ensemble method for modelling the relationship between response and explanatory variables) and identified the potential changes in future stocks due to sea level rise. We found levels of SOC stocks of mangrove and seagrass meadows have different drivers, with climatic variables such as temperature, rainfall and solar radiation, showing significant contributions in accounting for variation in SOC stocks in mangroves. In contrast, soil type accounted for most of the variability in seagrass meadows. Total SOC stock in the GBR catchments, including mangroves, seagrass meadows and tidal marshes, is approximately 137 Tg C, which represents 9\%-13\% of Australia's total SOC stock while encompassing only 4\%-6\% of the total extent of Australian coastal wetlands. In a global context, this could represent 0.5\%-1.4\% of global SOC stock. Our study suggests that landward migration due to projected sea level rise has the potential to enhance carbon accumulation with total carbon gains between 0.16 and 0.46 Tg C and provides an opportunity for future restoration to enhance blue carbon.

TI  - Saltmarsh sediments with wastewater input emit more carbon greenhouse gases but less N2O than mangrove sediments
AB  - Wastewater discharge and salt marsh invasion are two main disturbances in global mangrove wetland ecosystems, but their combined effects on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions remain unclear. Here, we performed a laboratory incubation experiment by adding wastewater (aquaculture and domestic wastewater) to mangrove and salt marsh sediments. Dissolved GHGs (CO2, CH4 and N2O) and environmental parameters were measured over a time series of 50 days. The nitrification and denitrification rates and corresponding functional gene abundances (AOA, AOB, nirS, and narG) were also quantified. The results show that wastewater addition significantly increased GHG emissions and global warming potential (GWP) in wetland sediments (p &lt; 0.05 for both). Compared with mangroves, salt marsh sediments produced more carbon GHGs (CO2 and CH4) but less N2O after wastewater input. These different stimulatory effects could be explained by the nitrogen and carbon substrate availability, organic matter quality, and functional gene abundances in sediments. Assessing GHG emissions as CO2 equivalents, future scenarios of increasing salt marsh invasion with wastewater addition would increase the GWP caused by CO2 and CH4, decrease blue carbon sequestration potential in wetlands, and decrease the GWP caused by N2O and total GWP, indicating a great impact on global climate change and important implications for managing coastal wetlands.

Wetland construction is used to mitigate losses of marsh cover and services resulting from human impacts in coastal areas. Though marsh structure can recover relatively quickly (i.e., <10 years) after construction, there are often long-term lags in the recovery of ecosystem functions in constructed marshes. We conducted a year-long study comparing seasonal plant productivity, ecosystem respiration (ERCO2), denitrification, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) between two 33-year-old constructed marshes (CON-1, CON-2) and a nearby natural reference marsh (NAT). We found that CON-1 and CON-2 were structurally similar to NAT (i.e., plant aboveground and belowground biomass did not differ). Likewise, gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), ERCO2, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were similar across all marshes. Further, DNRA and denitrification were similar across marshes, with the exception of greater denitrification rates at CON-2 than at the other two sites. While pore-water ammonium concentrations were similar across all marshes, organic matter (OM) content, pore-water phosphate, nitrate + nitrite, and hydrogen sulfide concentrations were greater in NAT than CON-1 and CON-2. Collectively, this work suggests that current marsh construction practices could be a suitable tool for recovering plant structure and some ecosystem functions. However, the lag in recovery of pore-water nutrient stocks and OM content also suggests that some biogeochemical functions may take longer than a few decades to fully recover in constructed marshes.

TI  - Surface evolution and carbon sequestration in disturbed and undisturbed wetland soils of the Hunter estuary, southeast Australia
AB  - The aim of this work was to quantify the soil carbon storage and sequestration rates of undisturbed natural wetlands and disturbed wetlands subject to restriction of tidal flow and subsequent rehabilitation in an Australian estuary. Disturbed and undisturbed estuarine wetlands of the Hunter estuary, New South Wales, Australia were selected as the study sites for this research. Vertical accretion rates of estuarine substrates were combined with soil carbon concentrations and bulk densities to determine the carbon store and carbon sequestration rates of the substrates tested. Relationships between estuary water level, soil evolution and vertical accretion were also examined. The carbon sequestration rate of undisturbed wetlands was lower (15\% for mangrove and 55\% for saltmarsh) than disturbed wetlands, but the carbon store was higher (65\% for mangrove and 60\% for saltmarsh). The increased carbon sequestration rate of the disturbed wetlands was driven by substantially higher rates of vertical accretion (95\% for mangrove and 345\% for saltmarsh). Estuarine wetland carbon stores were estimated at 700-1000 Gg C for the Hunter estuary and 3900-5600 Gg C for New South Wales. Vertical accretion and carbon sequestration rates of estuarine wetlands in the Hunter are at the lower end of the range reported in the literature. The comparatively high carbon sequestration rates reported for the disturbed wetlands in this study indicate that wetland rehabilitation has positive benefits for regulation of atmospheric carbon concentrations, in addition to more broadly accepted ecosystem services.

TI  - Unravelling the potential of halophytes for marine integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA)-a perspective on performance, opportunities and challenges
AB  - The present study critically analyses peer-reviewed literature addressing the potential of halophytes to remediate nutrient-rich effluents from marine and coastal aquaculture, as well as the potential for their economic valorization, from human consumption to an untapped source of valuable secondary metabolites with pharmaceutical potential. The growing body of evidence discussed in this review supports the perspective that halophytes can become a new source of nutrition and other high-value compounds and be easily incorporated into saltwater-based integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems. In this context, halophytes act as extractors of dissolved inorganic nutrients, primarily nitrogen and phosphate, usually wasted in marine aquaculture farms. Phytoremediation using halophytes has been proven to be an efficient solution, and several ways exist to couple this practice with land-based marine aquaculture systems, namely through constructed wetlands and aquaponics. Focusing research on ecosystem-based approaches to aquaculture production will provide valuable data for producers and policy makers in order to improve decision making towards a sustainable development of this economic sector. Eco-intensification of aquaculture through IMTA will potentially increase the overall productivity and resilience of the sector, and halophytes, in particular, are on the verge of becoming key players for the diversification and promotion of land-based IMTA. This work specifically documents the uncharted potential of Halimione portulacoides, an important halophyte in European salt marsh ecosystems, as a new extractive species for IMTA.

TI  - Carbon export from fringing saltmarsh shoreline erosion overwhelms carbon storage across a critical width threshold
AB  - Saltmarshes are carbon storage hotspots and help to offset anthropogenic carbon emissions; however, marshes are threatened by sea-level rise, erosion, and human development. Recent efforts to constrain the saltmarsh carbon cycle have focused on the processes of carbon burial and sequestration with respect to sea-level rise and global warming. Simultaneously, many marshes that fringe the margins of estuaries and barrier islands are eroding, which releases old carbon from the saltmarsh and transports it into the estuary, and that process should be included in marsh carbon budgets. Additionally, if marshes cannot transgress the upland at a rate that balances shoreline retreat, then the marsh will narrow, thus reducing the area available for carbon storage. Here, we present the development of a box model that incorporates both carbon storage and carbon export via shoreline erosion to estimate the annual carbon budget of saltmarsh sediments. We test the model using field data collected at a fringing marsh within the Rachel Carson National Estuarine Research Reserve in North Carolina. The shoreline erosion rates along the fringing marsh are variable and the model output shows that the stretch of marsh that is retreating 0.76 m yr(-1) switched to a carbon source in 1930, while another portion of the marsh that is retreating more slowly (0.65 m yr(-1)) will switch to a source in 2021. The model indicates that the carbon budget of a saltmarsh is highly sensitive to the rate of shoreline retreat and that rapidly-eroding marshes may already be net sources of carbon. These results underscore the importance of conserving existing marshes, mitigating shoreline erosion, and considering shoreline erosion in the design of saltmarsh restoration projects.

TI  - [Biomass and carbon storage of Phragmites australis and Spartina alterniflora in Jiuduan Shoal Wetland of Yangtze Estuary, East China]
AB  - By the methods of field survey and laboratory analysis, an investigation was conducted on the seasonal dynamics of biomass and carbon storage of Phragmites australis and Spartina alterniflora dominated vegetation belts in the Jiuduan Shoal Wetland of Yangtze Estuary, East China in 2010-2012. The organic carbon storage of the biomass (including aboveground part, underground part, and standing litter) of the two plants was the highest in autumn and the lowest in spring. The average carbon storage of the biomass of S. alterniflora per unit area (445.81 g x m(-2)) was much higher than that of P. australis (285.52 g x m(-2)), and the average carbon storage of the standing litter of S. alterniflora (315.28 g x m(-2)) was also higher than that of P. australia (203.15 g x m(-2)). However, the organic carbon storage in the surface soil (0-30 cm) under P. australis community (1048.62 g x m(-2)) was almost as twice times as that under S. alterniflora community (583.33 g x m(-2)). Overall, the carbon accumulation ability of P. australis community (3212.96 g x m(-2)) was stronger than that of the S. alterniflora community (2730.42 g x m(-2)). Therefore, it is of significance to protect the P. australis community in terms of carbon sequestration at the salt marsh.

TI  - Pore water exchange-driven inorganic carbon export from intertidal salt marshes
AB  - Respiration in intertidal salt marshes generates dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) that is exported to the coastal ocean by tidal exchange with the marsh platform. Understanding the link between physical drivers of water exchange and chemical flux is a key to constraining coastal wetland contributions to regional carbon budgets. The spatial and temporal (seasonal, annual) variability of marsh pore water exchange and DIC export was assessed from a microtidal salt marsh (Sage Lot Pond, Massachusetts). Spatial variability was constrained from Ra-224 : Th-228 disequilibria across two hydrologic units within the marsh sediments. Disequilibrium between the more soluble Ra-224 and its sediment-bound parent Th-228 reveals significant pore water exchange in the upper 5 cm of the marsh surface (0-36 L m(-2) d(-1)) that is most intense in low marsh elevation zones, driven by tidal overtopping. Surficial sediment DIC transport ranges from 0.0 to 0.7 g C m(-2) d(-1). The sub-surface sediment horizon intersected by mean low tide was disproportionately impacted by tidal pumping (20-80 L m(-2) d(-1)) and supplied a seasonal DIC flux of 1.7-5.4 g C m(-2) d(-1). Export exceeded 10 g C m(-2) d(-1) for another marsh unit, demonstrating that fluxes can vary substantially across salt marshes under similar conditions within the same estuary. Seasonal and annual variability in marsh pore water exchange, constrained from tidal time-series of radium isotopes, was driven in part by variability in mean sea level. Rising sea levels will further inundate high marsh elevation zones, which may lead to greater DIC export.

TI  - Importance of the hydrogen route in up-scaling electrosynthesis for microbial CO2 reduction
AB  - Microbial electrochemical reduction of CO2 was carried out under two different applied potentials, -0.36 V and -0.66 V vs. SHE, using a biological sludge as the inoculum. Both potentials were thermodynamically appropriate for converting CO2 to acetate but only -0.66 V enabled hydrogen evolution. No acetate production was observed at -0.36 V, while up to 244 +/- 20 mg L-1 acetate was produced at -0.66 V vs. SHE. The same microbial inoculum implemented in gas-liquid contactors with H-2 and CO2 gas supply led to acetate production of 2500 mg L-1. When a salt marsh sediment was used as the inoculum, no reduction was observed in the electrochemical reactors, while supplying H-2 + CO2 gas led to formate and then acetate production. Finally, pure cultures of Sporomusa ovata grown under H-2 and CO2 gas feeding showed acetate production of up to 2904 mg L-1, higher than those reported so far in the literature for S. ovata implemented in bioelectrochemical processes. Unexpected ethanol production of up to 1411 mg L-1 was also observed. All these experimental data confirm that hydrogen produced on the cathode by water electrolysis is an essential mediator in the microbial electrochemical reduction of CO2. Implementing homoacetogenic microbial species in purposely designed gas-liquid biocontactors should now be considered as a relevant strategy for developing CO2 conversion.

TI  - Oxygen Consumption and Sulfate Reduction in Vegetated Coastal Habitats: Effects of Physical Disturbance
AB  - Vegetated coastal habitats (VCHs), such as mangrove forests, salt marshes and seagrass meadows, have the ability to capture and store carbon in the sediment for millennia, and thus have high potential for mitigating global carbon emissions. Carbon sequestration and storage is inherently linked to the geochemical conditions created by a variety of microbial metabolisms, where physical disturbance of sediments may expose previously anoxic sediment layers to oxygen (O-2), which could turn them into carbon sources instead of carbon sinks. Here, we used O-2, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and pH microsensors to determine how biogeochemical conditions, and thus aerobic and anaerobic metabolic pathways, vary across mangrove, salt marsh and seagrass sediments (case study from the Sydney area, Australia). We measured the biogeochemical conditions in the top 2.5 cm of surface (0-10 cm depth) and experimentally exposed deep sediments (>50 cm depth) to simulate undisturbed and physically exposed sediments, respectively, and how these conditions may affect carbon cycling processes. Mangrove surface sediment exhibited the highest rates of O-2 consumption and sulfate (SO42-) reduction based on detailed microsensor measurements, with a diffusive O-2 uptake rate of 102 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1) and estimated sulfate reduction rate of 57 mmol S-tot(2-) m(-2) d(-1). Surface sediments (0-10 cm) across all the VCHs generally had higher O-2 consumption and estimated sulfate reduction rates than deeper layers (> 50 cm depth). O-2 penetration was <4 mm for most sediments and only down to similar to 1 mm depth in mangrove surface sediments, which correlated with a significantly higher percent organic carbon content (\%C-org) within sediments originating from mangrove forests as compared to those from seagrass and salt marsh ecosystems. Additionally, pH dropped from 8.2 at the sediment/water interface to <7-7.5 within the first 20 mm of sediment within all ecosystems. Prevailing anoxic conditions, especially in mangrove and seagrass sediments, as well as sediment acidification with depth, likely decreased microbial remineralisation rates of sedimentary carbon. However, physical disturbance of sediments and thereby exposure of deeper sediments to O-2 seemed to stimulate aerobic metabolism in the exposed surface layers, likely reducing carbon stocks in VCHs.

TI  - Integrating Aquatic Metabolism and Net Ecosystem CO2 Balance in Short- and Long-Hydroperiod Subtropical Freshwater Wetlands
AB  - How aquatic primary productivity influences the carbon (C) sequestering capacity of wetlands is uncertain. We evaluated the magnitude and variability in aquatic C dynamics and compared them to net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco) rates within calcareous freshwater wetlands in Everglades National Park. We continuously recorded 30-min measurements of dissolved oxygen (DO), water level, water temperature (T-water), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). These measurements were coupled with ecosystem CO2 fluxes over 5 years (2012-2016) in a long-hydroperiod peat-rich, freshwater marsh and a short-hydroperiod, freshwater marl prairie. Daily net aquatic primary productivity (NAPP) rates indicated both wetlands were generally net heterotrophic. Gross aquatic primary productivity (GAPP) ranged from 0 to - 6.3 g C m(-2) day(-1) and aquatic respiration (R-Aq) from 0 to 6.13 g C m(-2) day(-1). Nonlinear interactions between water level, T-water, and GAPP and R-Aq resulted in high variability in NAPP that contributed to NEE. Net aquatic primary productivity accounted for 4-5\% of the deviance explained in NEE rates. With respect to the flux magnitude, daily NAPP was a greater proportion of daily NEE at the long-hydroperiod site (mean = 95\%) compared to the short-hydroperiod site (mean = 64\%). Although we have confirmed the significant contribution of NAPP to NEE in both long- and short-hydroperiod freshwater wetlands, the decoupling of the aquatic and ecosystem fluxes could largely depend on emergent vegetation, the carbonate cycle, and the lateral C flux.

TI  - Hydrologic Export Is a Major Component of Coastal Wetland Carbon Budgets
AB  - Coastal wetlands are among the most productive habitats on Earth and sequester globally significant amounts of atmospheric carbon (C). Extreme rates of soil C accumulation are widely assumed to reflect efficient C storage. Yet the fraction of wetland C lost via hydrologic export has not been directly quantified, since comprehensive budgets including direct estimates of lateral C loss are lacking. We present a complete net ecosystem C budget (NECB), demonstrating that lateral losses of C are a major component of the NECB for the largest stable brackish tidal marsh on the U.S. Pacific coast. Mean annual net ecosystem exchange of CO(2)with the atmosphere (NEE = -185 g C m(2)year(-1), negative NEE denoting ecosystem uptake) was compared to long-term soil C burial (87-110 g C m(2)year(-1)), suggesting only 47-59\% of fixed atmospheric C accumulates in soils. Consistently, direct monitoring in 2017-2018 showed NEE of -255 g C m(-2) year(-1), and hydrologic export of 105 g C m(-2) year(-1)(59\% of NEE remaining on site). Despite their high C sequestration capacity, lateral losses from coastal wetlands are typically a larger fraction of the NECB when compared to other terrestrial ecosystems. Loss of inorganic C (the least measured NECB term) was 91\% of hydrologic export and may be the most important term limiting C sequestration. The high productivity of coastal wetlands thus serves a dual function of C burial and estuarine export, and the multiple fates of fixed C must be considered when evaluating wetland capacity for C sequestration.

TI  - Inorganic and Black Carbon Hotspots Constrain Blue Carbon Mitigation Services Across Tropical Seagrass and Temperate Tidal Marshes
AB  - Total organic carbon (TOC) sediment stocks as a CO2 mitigation service require exclusion of allochthonous black (BC) and particulate inorganic carbon corrected for waterâ€“atmospheric equilibrium (PICeq). For the first time, we address this bias for a temperate salt marsh and a coastal tropical seagrass in BC hotspots that represent two different blue carbon ecosystems of Malaysia and Australia. Seagrass TOC stocks were similar to the salt marshes with soil depths &lt; 1Â m (59.3 Â± 11.3 and 74.9 Â± 18.9 MgC haâˆ’ 1, CI 95 % respectively). Both ecosystems showed larger BC constraints than did their pristine counterparts. However, the seagrass meadowsâ€™ mitigation services were largely constrained by both higher BC/TOC and PICeq/TOC fractions (38.0 % Â± 6.6 and 43.4 % Â± 5.9 %, CI 95 %) and salt marshes around a third (22 % Â± 10.2 and 6.0 % Â± 3.1 % CI 95 %). The results provide useful data from underrepresented regions, and, reiterates the need to consider both BC and PIC for more reliable blue carbon mitigation assessments to ensure that greenhouse gas emitters do not exceed the ecosystemsâ€™ capacity.

TI  - Soil carbon consequences of historic hydrologic impairment and recent restoration in coastal wetlands
AB  - Coastal wetlands provide key ecosystem services, including substantial long-term storage of atmospheric CO2 in soil organic carbon pools. This accumulation of soil organic matter is a vital component of elevation gain in coastal wetlands responding to sea-level rise. Anthropogenic activities that alter coastal wetland function through disruption of tidal exchange and wetland water levels are ubiquitous. This study assesses soil vertical accretion and organic carbon accretion across five coastal wetlands that experienced over a century of impounded hydrology, followed by restoration of tidal exchange 5 to 14 years prior to sampling. Nearby marshes that never experienced tidal impoundment served as controls with natural hydrology to assess the impact of impoundment and restoration. Dated soil cores indicate that elevation gain and carbon storage were suppressed 30â€“70 % during impoundment, accounting for the majority of elevation deficit between impacted and natural sites. Only one site had substantial subsidence, likely due to oxidation of soil organic matter. Vertical and carbon accretion gains were achieved at all restored sites, with carbon burial increasing from 96 Â± 33 to 197 Â± 64 g C mâˆ’2 yâˆ’1. The site with subsidence was able to accrete at double the rate (13 Â± 5.6 mm yâˆ’1) of the natural complement, due predominantly to organic matter accumulation rather than mineral deposition, indicating these ecosystems are capable of large dynamic responses to restoration when conditions are optimized for vegetation growth. Hydrologic restoration enhanced elevation resilience and climate benefits of these coastal wetlands. Â© 2022

TI  - Nitrogen removal by eutrophic coastal wetlands accomplished with CH4 emission reduction
AB  - Coastal wetlands play an important role in nitrogen removal and are a vital blue carbon sink. The produced methane (CH4) in coastal wetlands has been recently identified as a possible carbon source for denitrification process, providing a significant contribution to coastal nitrogen cycling. However, the in-situ correlation between CH4 emissions and denitrification rate, as well as their coupling mechanism is still unclear. Here, we investigated the nitrogen removal pattern throughout a complete tidal cycle, quantified the in-situ linkage between CH4 emissions and denitrification rate, and explored the associated microbial mechanisms in the eutrophic coastal wetland. The results showed that (1) the removal of nitrogen was driven by the tidal cycle (marsh flooding and drying), which involved two processes - physical interception and microbial denitrification; (2) the denitrification rate was linearly positively correlated to the CH4 emission (R-2 = 0.87, p < 0.0001); (3) nitrite- and nitrate dependent denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation (DAMO) coexisted in the wetland sediment, and promoted nitrogen removal by utilizing CH4 as the carbon source for denitrification. Our findings suggested that CH4 emission could enhance denitrification via DAMO in the field, and deepened the understanding of the dynamic nitrogen removal process within eutrophic coastal wetlands, and further indicated a strong interaction between coastal carbon and nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Effects of nitrogen and sulfate additions on methane production and oxidation in the min river estuarine marsh
AB  - Methane (CH4) is a major greenhouse gas (CHC), accounting for approximately 17% of global warming, with a relative global warming potential 34 times more powerful than carbon dioxide (CO2) on a mass basis. Wetland systems are considered to be the largest natural source of CH4 emitted to the atmosphere, with CH4 fluxes determined through analysis the balance of CH4 production by methanogens under anoxic conditions, and CH4 oxidation by methanotrophs under aerobic conditions. Human activities, such as fossil-fuel combustion and nitrogen fertilizer application, have resulted in much higher nitrogen and sulfate loads in wetlands. Although estuarine tidal marshes are important contributors to GHG emissions, the relationships between CH4 production, oxidation, and nitrogen and sulfate enrichment have not been thoroughly investigated in these environments. Using laboratory incubation techniques, the short-term effects of nitrogen and sulfate addition on soil CH4 production and oxidation of the tidal Cyperus malaccensis wetlands of the Min River estuary were measured in July 2015, and the soil physical and chemical properties were examined following nitrogen and sulfate treatments. Under anoxic conditions, CH4 production rates in the NH4Cl (N1) and NH4NO3(N3) treatments at different stages increased by 136. 70% and 136.55%, respectively, which were significantly higher than in the control treatment (P &lt;0.05). CH4 production rates in soils under the NH4Cl+K2SO4(NS1) and NH4NO3 +K2SO4(NS1) treatments increased after the 3rd, 6th, 12th, 15th, and 18th days following incubation. However, there were no significant differences in the KNO3(N2), K2SO4(S), and KNO3 +K2SO4(NS2) treatments compared with the control. Under aerobic conditions, CH4 oxidation rates in the N2, N3, NS2, and NS3 treatments increased by 145.30%, 142.93%, 139.48%, and 112.68%,respectively, compared with the control, whereas CH4 oxidation rates in the N1 and S treatments decreased by 16.54% and 20.99%, respectively, compared to the control treatment, although no significant differences were observed across the treatments. During the incubation period, daily CH4 production and oxidation initially increased with incubation time but then decreased in different nitrogen and sulfate treatments, with the magnitudes of both CH4 production and oxidation exhibiting similar temporal patterns across treatments. There were no significant differences in soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), electrical conductivity, and pH among the different treatments (P &lt;0.05) following short-term incubation; however, ammonium nitrogen (NH+4-N) concentrations increased significantly in the N1, N3, NS1, and NS3 treatments (P &lt;0.05); nitrate nitrogen (NO-3-N) concentrations increased significantly in soils under the N2, N3, NS2, and NS3 (P &lt;0.05); and sulfate (SO2-4) concentrations increased significantly in soils under the S, NS1, NS2, and NS3 treatments (P&lt;0.05). Correlation analyses indicated that DOC, NH+4-N, and NO-3-N were the main driving factors influencing the production and oxidation of CH4 in the Min River estuary tidal wetlands.

TI  - Nitrate addition stimulates microbial decomposition of organic matter in salt marsh sediments
AB  - Salt marshes sequester carbon at rates more than an order of magnitude greater than their terrestrial counterparts, helping to mitigate climate change. As nitrogen loading to coastal waters continues, primarily in the form of nitrate, it is unclear what effect it will have on carbon storage capacity of these highly productive systems. This uncertainty is largely driven by the dual role nitrate can play in biological processes, where it can serve as a nutrient-stimulating primary production or a thermodynamically favorable electron acceptor fueling heterotrophic metabolism. Here, we used a controlled flow-through reactor experiment to test the role of nitrate as an electron acceptor, and its effect on organic matter decomposition and the associated microbial community in salt marsh sediments. Organic matter decomposition significantly increased in response to nitrate, even at sediment depths typically considered resistant to decomposition. The use of isotope tracers suggests that this pattern was largely driven by stimulated denitrification. Nitrate addition also significantly altered the microbial community and decreased alpha diversity, selecting for taxa belonging to groups known to reduce nitrate and oxidize more complex forms of organic matter. Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy further supported these results, suggesting that nitrate facilitated decomposition of complex organic matter compounds into more bioavailable forms. Taken together, these results suggest the existence of organic matter pools that only become accessible with nitrate and would otherwise remain stabilized in the sediment. The existence of such pools could have important implications for carbon storage, since greater decomposition rates as N loading increases may result in less overall burial of organic-rich sediment. Given the extent of nitrogen loading along our coastlines, it is imperative that we better understand the resilience of salt marsh systems to nutrient enrichment, especially if we hope to rely on salt marshes, and other blue carbon systems, for long-term carbon storage.

TI  - POLYSACCHARIDE ADDITION EFFECTS ON RHIZOSPHERE NITROGEN FIXATION RATES OF THE CALIFORNIA CORDGRASS, SPARTINA FOLIOSA
AB  - Low nutrient availability in salt marsh ecosystems can potentially limit primary productivity and subsequent carbon export to coastal waters. In temperate marshes with low external nitrogen inputs, nitrogen (N(2)) fixation may enhance availability of usable nitrogen to marsh plant communities and increase their growth. The effects of sub-surface soil amendment of polysaccharides on rhizosphere N(2) fixation, and on plant growth and tissue characteristics of the California cordgrass, Spartina foliosa, were tested in microcosms in a tidal simulator. Polysaccharide was added as alginate extract, and rhizosphere N(2) fixation and plant characteristics were measured over 9 weeks. N(2) fixation rates increased 10-fold in the alginate treatment compared to controls after 1 week of exposure as a result of increased availability of a readily usable form of carbon. N(2) fixation rates in amended sediment were significantly higher than rates in control sediments at weeks 1 and 3. Although plant characteristics did not differ between treatments, trends of increased number of leaves and shoots in amended plants compared to controls appeared between weeks 7 and 9. The potential for increased plant growth following an increase in N(2) fixation rates warrants further investigation as it may have implications for recovery of N-limited disturbed and restored salt marshes.

TI  - Comparing soil carbon sequestration in coastal freshwater wetlands with various geomorphic features and plant communities in Veracruz, Mexico
AB  - Background and aims: Wetlands are important carbon sinks across the planet. However, soil carbon sequestration in tropical freshwater wetlands has been studied less than its counterpart in temperate wetlands. We compared carbon stocks and carbon sequestration in freshwater wetlands with various geomorphic features (estuarine, perilacustrine and depressional) and various plant communities (marshes and swamps) on the tropical coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. These swamps are dominated by Ficus insipida, Pachira aquatic and Annona glabra and the marshes by Typha domingensis, Thalia geniculata, Cyperus giganteus, and Pontederia sagittata. Methods: The soil carbon concentration and bulk density were measured every 2 cm along 80 cm soil profiles in five swamps and five marshes. Short-term sediment accretion rates were measured during a year using horizontal makers in three of the five swamps and marshes, the carbon sequestration was calculated using the accretion rates, and the bulk density and the percentage of organic carbon in the surficial layer was measured. Results: The average carbon concentration ranged from 50 to 150 gC kg-1 in the marshes and 50 to 225 gC kg-1 in the swamps. When the wetlands were grouped according to their geomorphic features, no significant differences in the carbon stock (P = 0.095) were found (estuarine (25.50 Â± 2.26 kgC m-2), perilacustrine (28.33 Â± 2.74 kgC m-2) and depressional wetlands (34.93 Â± 4.56 kgC m-2)). However, the carbon stock was significantly higher (P = 0.030) in the swamps (34.96 Â± 1.3 kgC m-2) than in the marshes (25.85 Â± 1.19 kgC m-2). The average sediment accretion rates were 1.55 Â± 0.09 cm yr-1 in the swamps and 0.84 Â± 0.02 cm yr-1 in the marshes with significant differences (P = 0.040). The rate of carbon sequestration was higher (P = 0.001) in swamp soils (0.92 Â± 0.12 kgC m-2 yr-1) than marsh soils (0.31 Â± 0.08 kgC m-2 yr-1). Differences in the rates of carbon sequestration associated with geomorphic features were found between the swamp ecosystems (P &lt; 0.05); i.e., higher values were found in the swamps than in the marshes in perilacustrine and estuarine wetlands (P &lt; 0.05). However, no significant differences (P = 0.324) in carbon sequestration rates were found between the marsh and swamp areas of the depressional site. Conclusions: Swamp soils are more important contributors to the carbon stock and sequestration than are marsh soils, resulting in a reduction in global warming, which suggests that the plant community is an important factor that needs to be considered in global carbon budgets and projects of restoration and conservation of wetlands.

TI  - Impact of climate change and related disturbances on CO2 and CH4 cycling in coastal wetlands
AB  - This chapter discusses the influence of climate change on coastal wetland productivity, organic carbon burial, CO2 and CH4 production, and their emissions. We reviewed studies that were performed in atmosphere-controlled greenhouses or open-top chambers to quantify the role of climate change on mangrove and saltmarsh productivity, as well as in situ studies that used the eddy-covariance method or incubation chambers at the various interfaces to quantify CO2 and CH4 flux variability with temperature, precipitation, or tides. Coastal wetland productivity responses to the increases of temperature and of atmospheric CO2 concentrations will not be a simple increase but will most probably vary with the biogeographic settings and the position of the stand in the intertidal zone, both influencing pore-water salinity and nutrient inputs. The productivity of mangroves may respond more significantly to elevated CO2 than that of saltmarshes. Changes in rainfall pattern will not only have an influence on ecosystem gross productivity but also on ecosystem respiration, modifying subsequently the net carbon budget of coastal wetlands. The effect of tidal flooding will be species-specific and will depend on the prevalent climate and the position of the stand along the intertidal zone (optimum for growth or not). Eventually, enhanced cyclonic intensity may reduce the productivity of these ecosystems. Increased tidal flushing and pore-water seepage resulting from sea-level rise will limit carbon burial, while productivity and sedimentation rates will increase. However, the effect of sea-level rise in modifying soil moisture and the rate of electron acceptors renewal will be site-specific depending on climate, soil permeability, and position along the tidal zone. Sea-level rise results in more water-saturated soils, which will limit greenhouse gas (GHG) production and emission. However, rise in temperature will enhance organic carbon mineralization. Eventually, GHG diffusion also depends on the responses of the microphytobenthos, bioturbation, and aerial root density to climate change. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Net ecosystem carbon exchange and the greenhouse gas balance of tidal marshes along an estuarine salinity gradient
AB  - Tidal wetlands are productive ecosystems with the capacity to sequester large amounts of carbon (C), but we know relatively little about the impact of climate change on wetland C cycling in lower salinity (oligohaline and tidal freshwater) coastal marshes. In this study we assessed plant production, C cycling and sequestration, and microbial organic matter mineralization at tidal freshwater, oligohaline, and salt marsh sites along the salinity gradient in the Delaware River Estuary over four years. We measured aboveground plant biomass, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchange between the marsh and atmosphere, microbial sulfate reduction and methanogenesis in marsh soils, soil biogeochemistry, and C sequestration with radiodating of soils. A simple model was constructed to estimate monthly and annually integrated rates of gross ecosystem production (GEP), ecosystem respiration (ER) to carbon dioxide () or methane (), net ecosystem production (NEP), the contribution of sulfate reduction and methanogenesis to ER, and the greenhouse gas (GHG) source or sink status of the wetland for 2 years (2007 and 2008). All three marsh types were highly productive but evidenced different patterns of C sequestration and GHG source/sink status. The contribution of sulfate reduction to total ER increased along the salinity gradient from tidal freshwater to salt marsh. The Spartina alterniflora dominated salt marsh was a C sink as indicated by both NEP (similar to 140 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and Pb-210 radiodating (336 g C m(-2) year(-1)), a minor sink for atmospheric CH4, and a GHG sink (similar to 620 g CO2-eq m(-2) year(-1)). The tidal freshwater marsh was a source of CH4 to the atmosphere (similar to 22 g C-CH4 m(-2) year(-1)). There were large interannual differences in plant production and therefore C and GHG source/sink status at the tidal freshwater marsh, though Pb-210 radiodating indicated modest C accretion (110 g C m(-2) year(-1)). The oligohaline marsh site experienced seasonal saltwater intrusion in the late summer and fall (up to 10 mS cm(-1)) and the Zizania aquatica monoculture at this site responded with sharp declines in biomass and GEP in late summer. Salinity intrusion was also linked to large effluxes of CH4 at the oligohaline site (> 80 g C-CH4 m(-2) year(-1)), making this site a significant GHG source (> 2,000 g CO2-eq m(-2) year(-1)). The oligohaline site did not accumulate C over the 2 year study period, though Pb-210 dating indicated long term C accumulation (250 g C m(-2) year(-1)), suggesting seasonal salt-water intrusion can significantly alter C cycling and GHG exchange dynamics in tidal marsh ecosystems.

TI  - Deciphering the dynamics of inorganic carbon export from intertidal salt marshes using high-frequency measurements
AB  - The lateral export of carbon from coastal marshes via tidal exchange is a key component of the marsh carbon budget and coastal carbon cycles. However, the magnitude of this export has been difficult to accurately quantify due to complex tidal dynamics and seasonal cycling of carbon. In this study, we use in situ, high-frequency measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and water fluxes to estimate lateral DIC fluxes from a U.S. northeastern salt marsh. DIC was measured by a CHANnelized Optical Sensor (CHANOS) that provided an in situ concentration measurement at 15-min intervals, during periods in summer (July - August) and late fall (December). Seasonal changes in the marsh had strong effects on DIC concentrations, while tidally-driven water fluxes were the fundamental vehicle of marsh carbon export. Episodic events, such as groundwater discharge and mean sea water level changes, can impact DIC flux through altered DIC concentrations and water flow. Variability between individual tides within each season was comparable to mean variability between the two seasons. Estimated mean DIC fluxes based on a multiple linear regression (MLR) model of DIC concentrations and high-frequency water fluxes agreed reasonably well with those derived from CHANOS DIC measurements for both study periods, indicating that high-frequency, modeled DIC concentrations, coupled with continuous water flux measurements and a hydrodynamic model, provide a robust estimate of DIC flux. Additionally, an analysis of sampling strategies revealed that DIC fluxes calculated using conventional sampling frequencies (hourly to two-hourly) of a single tidal cycle are unlikely to capture a representative mean DIC flux compared to longer-term measurements across multiple tidal cycles with sampling frequency on the order of tens of minutes. This results from a disproportionately large amount of the net DIC flux occurring over a small number of tidal cycles, while most tides have a near-zero DIC export. Thus, high-frequency measurements (on the order of tens of minutes or better) over the time period of interest are necessary to accurately quantify tidal exports of carbon species from salt marshes.

TI  - Blue carbon as a natural climate solution
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), including mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and tidal marshes, store carbon and provide co-benefits such as coastal protection and fisheries enhancement. Blue carbon sequestration has therefore been suggested as a natural climate solution. In this Review, we examine the potential for BCEs to act as carbon sinks and the opportunities to protect or restore ecosystems for this function. Globally, BCEs are calculated to store >30,000 Tg C across similar to 185 million ha, with their conservation potentially avoiding emissions of 304 (141-466) Tg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) per year. Potential BCE restoration has been estimated in the range of 0.2-3.2 million ha for tidal marshes, 8.3-25.4 million ha for seagrasses and 9-13 million ha for mangroves, which could draw down an additional 841 (621-1,064) Tg CO(2)e per year by 2030, collectively amounting to similar to 3\% of global emissions (based on 2019 and 2020 global annual fossil fuel emissions). Mangrove protection and/or restoration could provide the greatest carbon-related benefits, but better understanding of other BCEs is needed. BCE destruction is unlikely to stop fully, and not all losses can be restored. However, engineering and planning for coastal protection offer opportunities for protection and restoration, especially through valuing co-benefits. BCE prioritization is potentially a cost-effective and scalable natural climate solution, but there are still barriers to overcome before blue carbon project adoption will become widespread.

TI  - The role of marsh-dominated heterotrophic continental margins in transport of CO2 between the atmosphere, the land-sea interface and the ocean
AB  - Recent air-to-sea CO2 flux measurements at several major continental shelves suggest that shelves may act as a one-way pump and absorb atmospheric CO2 into the ocean. The U. S. South Atlantic Bight (SAB) contrasts these findings in that it acts as a source of CO2 to the atmosphere while simultaneously exporting dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to the open ocean. The shelf-wide heterotrophy and carbon exports in the SAB are subsidized by the export of organic carbon from the abundant intertidal marshes, which are a sink for atmospheric CO2. It is proposed here that the SAB represents a marsh-dominated heterotrophic ocean margin as opposed to river-dominated autotrophic margins. Based on this and other studies, DIC export flux from margins to the open ocean must be significant in the overall global ocean carbon budget.

TI  - Fingerprinting macrophyte Blue Carbon by pyrolysis-GC-compound specific isotope analysis (Py-CSIA)
AB  - There is a need for tools to determine the origin of organic matter (OM) in Blue Carbon Ecosystems (BCE) and marine sediments to (1) facilitate the implementation of Blue Carbon strategies into carbon accounting and crediting schemes and (2) decipher changes in ecosystem condition over decadal to millennial time scales and thus to understand and predict the stability of BCE in a changing world. Pyrolysis-GC-compound specific isotope analysis (Py-CSIA) is applied for the first time in marine environments and BCE research. We studied Australian mangrove, tidal marsh and seagrass sediments, in addition to potential sources of OM (Avicennia, Posidonia, Zostera, Sarcocornia, Ecklonia and Ulva species and seagrass epiphytes), to identify precursors of different biomacromolecule constituents (lignin, polysaccharides and aliphatic structures). Firstly, the link between bulk Î´13C and Î´13C reconstructed from compound-specific Î´13C showed that the pyrolysis approach allows for the isotopic screening of a representative portion of the OM. Secondly, for all samples, the C isotope fingerprint of the carbohydrate products (plant polysaccharides) was the heaviest (13C enriched), followed by lignin and aliphatic products. The differences in Î´13C among macromolecules and the overlap in Î´13C among putative sources reflect the limitations of bulk Î´13C analyses for deciphering OM provenance. Thirdly, phanerogams specimen had the heaviest carbohydrate and lignin, confirming that seagrass-derived lignocellulose can be traced based on Î´13C. Consistent differences for individual compounds were identified between seagrasses and between Avicennia and Sarcocornia using Py-CSIA. Fourth, ecosystem shifts (colonization of seagrass habitats by mangrove) on millenary time scales, hypothesized in previous studies on the basis of bulk Î´13C and Py-GCâ€“MS, were confirmed by Py-CSIA. We conclude that Py-CSIA is useful in Blue Carbon research to decipher OM sources in marine sediments, identify ecosystem transitions in palaeoenvironmental records, and to understand the role of different OM compounds in Blue Carbon storage.

TI  - A 5000 year record of carbon sequestration from a coastal lagoon and wetland complex, southern California, USA
AB  - Coastal wetlands have the potential to accumulate C at high rates over long time periods because they continuously accrete and bury organic-rich sediments, giving soils in coastal wetlands a distinct advantage over many other environments in the sequestration of organic C. Given that coastal wetlands are being lost worldwide, it is important to understand their C sequestration potential. Sediments in a southern California, USA coastal lagoon-wetland complex were cored, and depositional environments were interpreted. Suitable materials were radiocarbon dated. Bulk density and organic C were grouped by depositional environments, and average mass of C per unit volume and C accumulation rates in each depositional environment were calculated. The total organic C sequestered and rates of sequestration in each depositional environment were in the following order from most (fastest) to least (slowest): lagoon, intertidal, salt marsh, freshwater marsh, aeolian. This study demonstrated that high levels of organic C are sequestered per unit volume of sediment (35.9Â±3.2 kg m-3), and the mean rate of C accumulation was high (0.033Â±0.0029 kg C m-2 year -1) over a long time period (5000 years). Results of this study strongly demonstrate the importance and necessary high priority for preserving and restoring coastal wetlands both in the USA and internationally. However, despite their excellent potential to sequester C, significant losses of coastal wetlands are occurring in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Â© 2004 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Spatial response of coastal marshes to increased atmospheric CO2
AB  - The elevation and extent of coastal marshes are dictated by the interplay between the rate of relative sea-level rise (RRSLR), surface accretion by inorganic sediment deposition, and organic soil production by plants. These accretion processes respond to changes in local and global forcings, such as sediment delivery to the coast, nutrient concentrations, and atmospheric CO2, but their relative importance for marsh resilience to increasing RRSLR remains unclear. In particular, marshes up-take atmospheric CO2 at high rates, thereby playing a major role in the global carbon cycle, but the morphologic expression of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, an imminent aspect of climate change, has not yet been isolated and quantified. Using the available observational literature and a spatially explicit ecomorphodynamic model, we explore marsh responses to increased atmospheric CO2, relative to changes in inorganic sediment availability and elevated nitrogen levels. We find that marsh vegetation response to foreseen elevated atmospheric CO2 is similar in magnitude to the response induced by a varying inorganic sediment concentration, and that it increases the threshold RRSLR initiating marsh submergence by up to 60% in the range of forcings explored. Furthermore, we find that marsh responses are inherently spatially dependent, and cannot be adequately captured through 0-dimensional representations of marsh dynamics. Our results imply that coastal marshes, and the major carbon sink they represent, are significantly more resilient to foreseen climatic changes than previously thought.

TI  - Aboveground allometric models for freeze-affected black mangroves (Avicennia germinans): Equations for a climate sensitive mangrove-marsh ecotone
AB  - Across the globe, species distributions are changing in response to climate change and land use change. In parts of the southeastern United States, climate change is expected to result in the poleward range expansion of black mangroves (Avicennia germinans) at the expense of some salt marsh vegetation. The morphology of A. germinans at its northern range limit is more shrub-like than in tropical climes in part due to the aboveground structural damage and vigorous multi-stem regrowth triggered by extreme winter temperatures. In this study, we developed aboveground allometric equations for freeze-affected black mangroves which can be used to quantify: (1) total aboveground biomass; (2) leaf biomass; (3) stem plus branch biomass; and (4) leaf area. Plant volume (i.e., a combination of crown area and plant height) was selected as the optimal predictor of the four response variables. We expect that our simple measurements and equations can be adapted for use in other mangrove ecosystems located in abiotic settings that result in mangrove individuals with dwarf or shrub-like morphologies including oligotrophic and arid environments. Many important ecological functions and services are affected by changes in coastal wetland plant community structure and productivity including carbon storage, nutrient cycling, coastal protection, recreation, fish and avian habitat, and ecosystem response to sea level rise and extreme climatic events. Coastal scientists in the southeastern United States can use the identified allometric equations, in combination with easily obtained and non-destructive plant volume measurements, to better quantify and monitor ecological change within the dynamic, climate sensitive, and highly-productive mangrove-marsh ecotone.

TI  - Carbon accumulation in Bay of Fundy salt marshes: Implications for restoration of reclaimed marshes
AB  - Transformation of agricultural land to natural terrestrial vegetation has been suggested as a means to increase soil carbon storage. However, the capacity for carbon storage in terrestrial soils is limited as compared to soils of tidal salt marshes, the original vegetation of many coastal agricultural lands. In a number of countries, tidal salt marshes have been ``reclaimed,{''} that is drained and diked to prevent tidal flooding and create suitable conditions for dry land agriculture. In this study we examine spatial and temporal patterns of carbon accumulation in tidal salt marshes of the Bay of Fundy and estimate the carbon storage potential of the bay's extensive area of reclaimed marsh. Rates of carbon accumulation vary from the upper to the outer Bay, over which there is a gradient of decreasing tidal range and suspended sediment supply. In the outer bay, high-marsh densities are highest (0.042 +/- 0.009 g C cm(-3)), but carbon accumulation rates over the past 30 years are lowest (76 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The reverse pattern occurs in the upper bay where carbon densities in the high-marsh environment are lowest (0.036 +/- 0.002 g C cm(-3)), but carbon accumulation rates over the past 30 years may be as high (184 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Compared to other ecosystems, the rates of carbon accumulation presented in this study were similar over timescales of years to centuries. Increases in relative sea level (over time) and suspended sediment supply (across the bay) positively affect the marsh soil accumulation rate and the rate of carbon sequestration. Parameters such as \%C are not useful predictors of a marsh's potential for carbon sequestration. Soil carbon densities of functioning marshes and reclaimed marsh soils are similar, but marsh soils have a storage capacity that increases with rising sea level, while agricultural soils, such as those in reclaimed marshes, have a fixed (or possibly decreasing in reclaimed marshes) volume over time.

TI  - First report on carbon storage in a warm-temperate mangrove forest in South Africa
AB  - Carbon (C) storage by vegetated coastal habitats (mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses) is globally recognized as a critical ecosystem service. Research efforts have therefore focused on quantifying C stored in these ``blue carbon{''} ecosystems but a notable knowledge gap still exists for certain geographical regions. This study aimed to provide the first comprehensive assessment of C storage in South African warm temperate mangroves by quantifying the C storage in aboveground biomass and soil C pools associated with the mangrove forest at the Nxaxo Estuary. C storage variability was also related to mangrove forest structure and soil environmental variables. C storage was quantified using standardized protocols for aboveground (live trees, leaf litter, pneumatophores) and soil C pools at five Avicennia marina sites. The results showed soil C storage to be spatially variable while aboveground C pools were similar between intertidal zones within the sites. The soil C pool made the largest contribution to total C storage at each site and ranged from 176.91 +/- 4.5MgC.ha(-1) to 262.53 +/- 18.8 MgC. ha(-1). Of the aboveground carbon pools, live trees made the largest contribution and ranged from 2.25. 1.0 MgC.ha(-1) to 9.56 +/- 3.6 MgC.ha(-1). Across all sites, average C storage for all pools was 234.9 +/- 39.16 MgC.ha(-1), which falls within the range reported for mangroves at other southern hemisphere range limits. Variability in soil C was linearly related to soil organic matter but this relationship was inconsistent between different soil depth intervals that were sampled. Total C storage was inversely related to mangrove tree density. This study confirms the need for more blue carbon studies to quantify C storage in under-represented geographical areas and to investigate factors that drive variability in C storage at different spatial scales.

TI  - Biomass allocation of tidal freshwater marsh species in response to natural and manipulated hydroperiod in coastal deltaic floodplains
AB  - Deltaic floodplains are highly vulnerable to relative sea level rise (RSLR) depending on the sediment supply from river channels that provides elevation capital as adaptation mechanism. In river channels where levees have restricted sediment supply to coastal deltaic floodplains, river sediment diversions have been proposed as a restoration strategy to increase elevation allowing for marshes to establish and cope with RSLR. The response of coastal wetlands to surface elevation has been well-defined for estuarine marshes, but models for coastal deltaic floodplain marshes have not been resolved. Here we coupled field observations from biomass plots and a mesocosm experiment ('marsh organ') with remote sensing techniques to assess biomass allocation of tidal freshwater marsh species in response to gradients in hydroperiod in Wax Lake Delta (WLD), coastal Louisiana, U.S.A.. We found that, contrary to salt-tolerant species, Colocasia esculenta aboveground biomass (AGB) is strongly positively correlated with percent inundated time (R-2 = 0.79, P < 0.001), increasing from (mean +/- 1SE) 186 +/- 69 g/m(2) in the supratidal zone to 1422 +/- 148 g/m(2) beyond its natural occurrence range in the lower intertidal zone. Belowground biomass consistently exceeded AGB at 2363 +/- 294 g/m(2) on average across elevation treatments. We also found that C. esculenta expanded its surface coverage area by 31\% in five years consistent with the growth and emergence of WLD's subaqueous platforms, reflecting this species ability to cope with higher inundation time. In contrast to earlier studies conducted in brackish and saline settings, where longer hydroperiods had negative effects on biomass accumulation, our data suggest that tidal freshwater marshes can cope with longer hydroperiods caused by river sediment diversions.

TI  - INTEGRATED CARBON BUDGET MODELS FOR THE EVERGLADES TERRESTRIAL-COASTAL-OCEANIC GRADIENT Current Status and Needs for Inter-Site Comparisons
AB  - Recent studies suggest that coastal ecosystems can bury significantly more C than tropical forests, indicating that continued coastal development and exposure to sea level rise and storms will have global biogeochemical consequences. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) site provides an excellent subtropical system for examining carbon (C) balance because of its exposure to historical changes in freshwater distribution and sea level rise and its history of significant long-term carbon-cycling studies. FCE LTER scientists used net ecosystem C balance and net ecosystem exchange data to estimate C budgets for riverine mangrove, freshwater marsh, and seagrass meadows, providing insights into the magnitude of C accumulation and lateral aquatic C transport. Rates of net C production in the riverine mangrove forest exceeded those reported for many tropical systems, including terrestrial forests, but there are considerable uncertainties around those estimates due to the high potential for gain and loss of C through aquatic fluxes. C production was approximately balanced between gain and loss in Everglades marshes; however, the contribution of periphyton increases uncertainty in these estimates. Moreover, while the approaches used for these initial estimates were informative, a resolved approach for addressing areas of uncertainty is critically needed for coastal wetland ecosystems. Once resolved, these C balance estimates, in conjunction with an understanding of drivers and key ecosystem feedbacks, can inform cross-system studies of ecosystem response to long-term changes in climate, hydrologic management, and other land use along coastlines.

TI  - Potential impact of large-scale tidal power developments in the upper bay of fundy on fisheries resources of the Northwest Atlantic
AB  - Construction of large-scale, hydroelectric tidal power developments in the upper Bay of Fundy is receiving serious consideration. Potential designs involve ebb-generation with 1400- 5300-MW plants using 7.6 m diameter, straight-flow, low-head turbines installed in dams up to 8 km in length. Discharge through individual turbines will be 400 m3/second at 50 rev/minute with draft tube velocities of 11.4 m/second. Calculated parameters for these turbines are a water length of 2.26 m, impact velocity of 23.99 m/second, blade tip velocity up to 28.7 m/second and a total pressure flux of 1.7 atm. The existing environment is macrotidal (tide range 11-16 m). Embayments are homogeneous estuaries with extremely turbid water. The intertidal biological community is a salt marsh-mudflat biome. The pelagic zone supports large populations of migratory fishes, particularly the alosids, Alosa sapidissima, A. aestivalis, A. pseudoharengus, and Clupea harengus. Striped bass, spiny dogfish, Atlantic salmon, and Atlantic sturgeon also constitute a significant portion of the fish community. Tagging experiments indicate this region is a northern migration terminus for American shad populations from all Atlantic coast rivers and abundance in an individual tidal basin is about 1.5 million adults during a single tidal cycle. Striped bass and alewife tagged in this region have been taken as far south as North Carolina. Upstream tidal headponds will have reduced tide ranges of 5-6 m and the lower energy will result in stratification of the water column and less turbidity. Increased sedimentation above and below the dams is expected to affect local soft-shell clam fisheries. Tidal barrages may alter fish migration routes and repeated passage through turbines during tide-related movements will cause significant mortality to both fish and marine mammals. Existing knowledge for fish passage design in this environment is inadequate for development of sound mitigation measures. Â© 1986 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - The intertidal plant communities in north-eastern Australia, their carbon stores and vulnerability to extreme climate events
AB  - During the strong El NiÃ±o event of 2015â€“2016 large-scale dieback of mangrove forests was observed in the Gulf of Carpentaria region of northern Australia. These and other intertidal communities are also extensive along the 7,400 km coastline of north-eastern Australia. Determination of their floristic composition, potential carbon (C) store and sequestration capacity, and vulnerability to climate extremes is required for their effective conservation management and was the aim of this study. Standardized, state-wide quantitative classification methods identified five mangrove forest and three saltmarsh communities covering 2,604 km2 along this coastline. Estuarine and oceanic mangrove forests were mapped separately. Carbon storage and sequestration capacity of the intertidal communities and their vulnerability to strong El NiÃ±o events were estimated using published data and GIS analyses. An estimated potential 126.2 (Â± 27.3 SEM) Tg C and 8.3 (Â±0.4 SD) Tg C were stored in the mangrove forests and saltmarshes, respectively. Comparatively, the rainforests of the region stored an estimated equivalent amount of C but covered three times the area, and the most widespread woodlands (Eucalyptus tetrodonta) of the region stored an estimated 1.5 times the C but covered 16 times the area. The C stored in the intertidal communities was estimated as equivalent to 493.47 Tg of CO2, valued at AU$6.8 billion on the Australian carbon market in December 2018. Annual C sequestration potential was 0.18â€“0.34 Tg C/year, valued between AU$8.9 and $17 million. Approximately 360 ha of mangrove forest was estimated as lost because of dieback during the 2015â€“16 El NiÃ±o event. Three types of mangrove forest were identified as potentially vulnerable to dieback from El NiÃ±o-driven climate events. This study highlights the national and global significance of these intertidal systems and our findings need to be incorporated in future conservation and development planning of northern Australia.

TI  - Invasive Spartina alterniflora can mitigate N2O emission in coastal salt marshes
AB  - Although there are studies on nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes in coastal salt marshes, temporal and spatial variations of this greenhouse gas are still uncertain. Especially salt marshes of the East China Sea coast covered by invasive Spartina alterniflora have shown controversial results. To analyse seasonal patterns of N2O fluxes and their relationship with environmental factors, three plots dominated by S. alterniflora, and differing in sediment salinity and vegetation history (P1, P2, P3), and one bare mudflat (P0) in a salt marsh of Nanhui shore in the southern fringe of Yangtze River estuary have been established. Monthly studies from March 2017 to January 2018 using a chamber technique showed that average N2O fluxes from all four plots ranged from -41.9 to 39.3 mu g N2O.m(-2).h(-1), whereas average flux (4.2 mu gN(2)O.m(-2).h(-1)) in P1, P2 and P3 was not significantly different from that measured in P0 (1.3 mu gN(2)O.m(-2).h(-1)). There was a clear seasonal difference: in spring and summer, all the sites showed slight emission while consumption prevailed in autumn and winter. In vegetated sites this trend was more remarkable than in the bare mudflat. N2O flux showed positive correlation (p <.05) with air and sediment temperature, and plant development (height of vegetation). Nitrate was not the limiting factor of N2O emission in the Yangtze estuary. In the salt marsh where vegetation community was mature, higher sediment salinity reduced N2O emission (P1 < P2) by influencing other environmental factors such as total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN) content and sediment texture. In comparison with other tidal macrophytes S. alterniflora showed relatively low N2O emission. Therefore, it can be considered as a species for tidal zone stabilisation.

TI  - Persistent reductions in the bioavailability of PCBs at a tidally inundated Phragmites australis marsh amended with activated carbon
AB  - In situ amendment of sediments with highly sorbent materials like activated carbon (AC) is an increasingly viable strategy to reduce the bioavailability of persistent, sediment-associated contaminants to benthic communities. Because in situ sediment remediation is an emerging strategy, much remains to be learned about the field conditions under which amendments can be effective, the resilience of amendment materials toward extreme weather conditions, and the optimal design of engineered applications. We report the results of a multiyear, pilot-scale field investigation designed to measure the persistence and efficacy of AC amendments to reduce the bioavailability of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in an intertidal Phragmites marsh. The amendments tested were granular AC (GAC), GAC with a layer of sand, and a pelletized fine AC. Key metrics presented include vertically resolved black carbon concentrations in sediment and PCB concentrations in sediment, porewater, and several invertebrate species. The results demonstrate that all 3 amendments withstood Hurricane Sandy and remained in place for the duration of the study, successfully reducing porewater PCB concentrations by 34 to 97%. Reductions in invertebrate bioaccumulation were observed in all amendment scenarios, with pelletized fine AC producing the most pronounced effect. The present findings support the use of engineered AC amendments in intertidal marshes and can be used to inform amendment design, delivery, and monitoring at other contaminated sediment sites.

TI  - Role of vegetated coastal ecosystems as nitrogen and phosphorous filters and sinks in the coasts of Saudi Arabia
AB  - Vegetated coastal ecosystems along the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf coasts of Saudi Arabia thrive in an extremely arid and oligotrophic environment, with high seawater temperatures and salinity. Mangrove, seagrass and saltmarsh ecosystems have been shown to act as efficient sinks of sediment organic carbon, earning these vegetated ecosystems the moniker 'blue carbon' ecosystems. However, their role as nitrogen and phosphorus (N and P) sinks remains poorly understood. In this study, we examine the capacity of blue carbon ecosystems to trap and store nitrogen and phosphorous in their sediments in the central Red Sea and Arabian Gulf. We estimated the N and P stocks (in 0.2 m thick-sediments) and accumulation rates (for the last century based on 210Pb and for the last millennia based on 14C) in mangrove, seagrass and saltmarsh sediments from eight locations along the coast of Saudi Arabia (81 cores in total). The N and P stocks contained in the top 20 cm sediments ranged from 61 g N m-2 in Red Sea seagrass to 265 g N m-2 in the Gulf saltmarshes and from 70 g P m-2 in Red Sea seagrass meadows and mangroves to 58 g P m-2 in the Gulf saltmarshes. The short-term N and P accumulation rates ranged from 0.09 mg N cm-2 yr-1 in Red Sea seagrass to 0.38 mg N cm-2 yr-1 in Gulf mangrove, and from 0.027 mg P cm-2 yr-1 in the Gulf seagrass to 0.092 mg P cm-2 yr-1 in Red Sea mangroves. Short-term N and P accumulation rates were up to 10-fold higher than long-term accumulation rates, highlighting increasing sequestration of N and P over the past century, likely due to anthropogenic activities such as coastal development and wastewater inputs.

TI  - A blueprint for blue carbon: toward an improved understanding of the role of vegetated coastal habitats in sequestering CO2
AB  - Recent research has highlighted the valuable role that coastal and marine ecosystems play in sequestering carbon dioxide (CO2). The carbon (C) sequestered in vegetated coastal ecosystems, specifically mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and salt marshes, has been termed ``blue carbon{''}. Although their global area is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than that of terrestrial forests, the contribution of vegetated coastal habitats per unit area to long-term C sequestration is much greater, in part because of their efficiency in trapping suspended matter and associated organic C during tidal inundation. Despite the value of mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and salt marshes in sequestering C, and the other goods and services they provide, these systems are being lost at critical rates and action is urgently needed to prevent further degradation and loss. Recognition of the C sequestration value of vegetated coastal ecosystems provides a strong argument for their protection and restoration; however, it is necessary to improve scientific understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control C sequestration in these ecosystems. Here, we identify key areas of uncertainty and specific actions needed to address them.

TI  - Flooding Alters Plant-Mediated Carbon Cycling Independently of Elevated Atmospheric CO2 Concentrations
AB  - Plant-mediated processes determine carbon (C) cycling and storage in many ecosystems; how plant-associated processes may be altered by climate-induced changes in environmental drivers is therefore an essential question for understanding global C cycling. In this study, we hypothesize that environmental alterations associated with near-term climate change can exert strong control on plant-associated ecosystem C cycling and that investigations along an extended hydrologic gradient may give mechanistic insight into C cycling. We utilize a mesocosm approach to investigate the response of plant, soil, and gaseous C cycling to changing hydrologic regimes and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations expected by 2100 in a coastal salt marsh in Louisiana, USA. Although elevated CO2 had no significant effects on C cycling, we demonstrate that greater average flooding depth stimulated C exchange, with higher rates of labile C decomposition, plant CO2 assimilation, and soil C respiration. Greater average flooding depth also significantly decreased the soil C pool and marginally increased the aboveground biomass C pool, leading to net losses in total C stocks. Further, flooding depths along an extended hydrologic gradient garnered insight into decomposition mechanisms that was not apparent from other data. In C-4 dominated salt marshes, sea level rise will likely overwhelm effects of elevated CO2 with climate change. Deeper flooding associated with sea level rise may decrease long-term soil C pools and quicken C exchange between soil and atmosphere, thereby threatening net C storage in salt marsh habitats. Manipulative studies will be indispensable for understanding biogeochemical cycling under future conditions. Plain Language Summary This study examines how near-term climate change may affect the exchange and storage of carbon by plants in salt marshes. Our results indicate that sea level rise will increase the amount of carbon that is moved from the soil into the atmosphere, shrinking the amount of carbon in salt marsh soil. This may reduce the ability of salt marshes to keep carbon in soil long term and decrease the ability of salt marshes to offset climate change. As salt marshes are some of the best ecosystems on the planet for storing carbon in soils, any change in how these ecosystems process carbon is important to understand.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration in Tidal Salt Marshes of the Northeast United States
AB  - Tidal salt marshes provide important ecological services, habitat, disturbance regulation, water quality improvement, and biodiversity, as well as accumulation and sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in vegetation and soil organic matter. Different management practices may alter their capacity to provide these ecosystem services. We examined soil properties (bulk density, percent organic C, percent N), C and N pools, C sequestration and N accumulation at four marshes managed with open marsh water management (OMWM) and four marshes that were not at U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) on the East Coast of the United States. Soil properties (bulk density, percent organic C, percent N) exhibited no consistent differences among managed and non-OMWM marshes. Soil organic carbon pools (0â€“60-cm depth) also did not differ. Managed marshes contained 15.9Â kgÂ C/m2 compared to 16.2Â kgÂ C/m2 in non-OMWM marshes. Proportionately, more C (per unit volume) was stored in surface than in subsurface soils. The rate of C sequestration, based on 137Cs and 210Pb dating of soil cores, ranged from 41 to 152Â g/m2/year. Because of the low emissions of CH4 from salt marshes relative to freshwater wetlands and the ability to sequester C in soil, protection and restoration of salt marshes can be a vital tool for delivering key ecosystem services, while at the same time, reducing the C footprint associated with managing these wetlands.

TI  - Tidal effects on ecosystem CO2 exchange at multiple timescales in a salt marsh in the Yellow River Delta
AB  - The tide plays a crucial role in maintaining the carbon sink strength in salt marsh ecosystems. Furthermore, the effects of tides on ecosystem carbon exchange could vary with different timescales. Using the eddy covariance technique combined with wavelet analysis, we analyzed the time-frequency characteristics of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) to address the tidal effects on NEE at multiple timescales. The wavelet analysis showed that NEE displayed a tidal-driven pattern with distinct characteristics at the multiday scale (i.e., 8-16 days) and the seasonal scale (i.e., 64-128 days). Moreover, a more significant controlling effect of light rather than air temperature on NEE was found at the diel scale. Tides also affected the variation of the diurnal pattern of NEE. Tidal flooding inhibited nighttime CO2 emissions (NEEnighttime) as well as decreased temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of NEEnighttime from 1.37 to 1.16. In contrast, the response of daytime NEE (NEEdaytime) to tidal activities was more complicated, as the NEEdaytime reacted differently with different months during the growing season. Overall, our findings can contribute to a better understanding of tidal effects on ecosystem carbon exchange in salt marshes.

TI  - Trace gas fluxes from tidal salt marsh soils: implications for carbon-sulfur biogeochemistry
AB  - Tidal salt marsh soils can be a dynamic source of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as sulfur-based trace gases such as carbon disulfide (CS2) and dimethylsulfide (DMS) which play roles in global climate and carbon-sulfur biogeochemistry. Due to the difficulty in measuring trace gases in coastal ecosystems (e.g., flooding, salinity), our current understanding is based on snapshot instantaneous measurements (e.g., performed during daytime low tide) which complicates our ability to assess the role of these ecosystems for natural climate solutions. We performed continuous, automated measurements of soil trace gas fluxes throughout the growing season to obtain high-temporal frequency data and to provide insights into magnitudes and temporal variability across rapidly changing conditions such as tidal cycles. We found that soil CO2 fluxes did not show a consistent diel pattern, CH4, N2O, and CS2 fluxes were highly variable with frequent pulse emissions (> 2500 %, > 10 000 %, and > 4500 % change, respectively), and DMS fluxes only occurred midday with changes > 185 000 %. When we compared continuous measurements with discrete temporal measurements (during daytime, at low tide), discrete measurements of soil CO2 fluxes were comparable with those from continuous measurements but misrepresent the temporal variability and magnitudes of CH4, N2O, DMS, and CS2. Discrepancies between the continuous and discrete measurement data result in differences for calculating the sustained global warming potential (SGWP), mainly by an overestimation of CH4 fluxes when using discrete measurements. The high temporal variability of trace gas fluxes complicates the accurate calculation of budgets for use in blue carbon accounting and earth system models. Copyright Â© 2022 Margaret Capooci.

TI  - The effects of condensed tannins derived from senescing Rhizophora mangle leaves on carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus mineralization in a Distichlis spicata salt marsh soil
AB  - Background and aims: Due to global warming, it is to be expected that mangroves will move north- and southwards and enter salt marshes, which will then be enriched with mangrove-derived organic compounds. Little is known about the effects that tannins, which are abundantly present in leaf litter of Rhizophora mangle, will have on the biogeochemical cycles in salt marsh soils. Methods: In microcosms, soil from a Distichlis spicata salt marsh was enriched with R. mangle-derived leaf powder (LP), crude condensed tannins (CCT) and purified condensed tannins (PCT), or with commercially available tannic acid (TA). Each treatment received a fixed amount of tannins, i.e. 10Â mg /g dry soil. Due to the enrichment with tannins in each fraction, the amount of carbon added increased from C &lt; TA = PCT &lt; CCT &lt; LP. At Day 7, 21, 35 and 42 of the incubation period, CO2 emission rates were determined after closing the microcosms for 24Â h. Net nitrogen and phosphorous mineralization rates were also determined for the entire incubation period. Experiments were done at Practical Salinity Units of 20, 28 and 35 to cover the range in salinities observed in the field (20 and 35 PSU). Results: For the whole incubation period, the CO2 emission increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) in the order of C &lt; PCT &lt; CCT = TA &lt; LP microcosms. The microcosms with LP showed immobilization of mineral nitrogen and phosphorus, while the other microcosms revealed net nitrogen and phosphorus mineralization in the order of CCT &lt; TA &lt; PCT &lt; C for N mineralization, and CCT = TA &lt; C &lt; PCT for P mineralization. The C and N mineralization rates measured at a salinity of 20 PSU were significantly larger than at 28 and 35 PSU. Conclusion: The results showed that mangrove leaf litter stimulated net C mineralization and N and P immobilization. Purified condensed tannins of senescing R. mangle leaves enhanced C and P, and suppressed net N mineralization. Â© 2018, The Author(s).

TI  - Impounded marshes on subsided islands:: Simulated vertical accretion, processes, and effects, Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, CA USA
AB  - There is substantial interest in stopping and reversing the effects of subsidence in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta) where organic soils predominate. Also, the passage of California Assembly Bill 32 in 2006 created the potential to trade credits for carbon sequestered in wetlands on subsided Delta islands. The primary purpose of the work described here was to estimate future vertical accretion and understand processes that affect vertical accretion and carbon sequestration in impounded marshes on subsided Delta islands. Using a cohort-accounting model, we simulated vertical accretion from 4,700 calibrated years before present (BP) at a wetland area located within Franks Tract State Recreation Area (lat 38.059, long -121.611, hereafter, "Franks Wetland")-a small, relatively undisturbed marsh island-and at the Twitchell Island subsidencereversal demonstration project since 1997. We used physical and chemical data collected during the study as well as literature values for model inputs. Model results compared favorably with measured rates of vertical accretion, mass of carbon sequestered, bulk density and organic matter content. Â© 2014 by the article author(s).

TI  - MODELLING THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL TEMPERATURE INCREASE ON THE GROWTH OF SALT MARSH PLANTS
AB  - Gradual increases in temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentrations have resulted from the increased human use of fossil fuels since the beginning of industrial activity. In coastal wetland ecosystems, salt marshes constitute important habitats because they play important ecological roles, acting as carbon sinks by capturing atmospheric CO2 and storing it in living plant tissue. Ecological models are important tools for understanding the results of anthropogenic impacts on a global scale. Global warming poses threats to salt marshes through different effects, e.g., increases in sea level. The objectives of this study were i) to assess how temperature increases will influence the growth of salt marsh plants, ii) to infer the carbon budget of salt marshes under temperature increase scenarios and iii) to predict how salt marsh plants will keep pace with increases in sea level. These goals were achieved by developing growth models of three different plants (Spartina maritima, Scirpus maritimus and Zostera noltei) found in the Mondego estuary. Models were developed for C-3 and C-4 plant species. The results suggest that a temperature increase enhances the aboveground biomass of salt marsh plants. According to the predictions of the models, the sedimentation rate of S. maritima and Z. noltei can keep pace with increases in sea level, but this is apparently not the case for S. maritimus. If S. maritimus disappears from the Mondego estuary, the carbon sequestration ability of the system should decrease due to the loss of active plant tissue. This conclusion is based on the fact that S. maritimus accumulated more than 80\% of the total carbon sequestered in the tissues by the three studied species.

TI  - Quantification of blue carbon in salt marshes of the Pacific coast of Canada
AB  - Tidal salt marshes are known to accumulate ``blue carbon `` at high rates relative to their surface area, which render these systems among the Earth's most efficient carbon (C) sinks. However, the potential for tidal salt marshes to mitigate global warming remains poorly constrained because of the lack of representative sampling of tidal marshes from around the globe, inadequate areal extent estimations, and inappropriate dating methods for accurately estimating C accumulation rates. Here we provide the first estimates of organic C storage and accumulation rates in salt marshes along the Pacific coast of Canada, within the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Clayoquot Sound Biosphere Reserve and Pacific Rim National Park Reserve, a region currently underrepresented in global compilations. Within the context of other sites from the Pacific coast of North America, these young Clayoquot Sound marshes have relatively low C stocks but are accumulating C at rates that are higher than the global average with pronounced differences between high and low marsh habitats. The average C stock calculated during the past 30 years is 54 +/- 5 Mg C ha(-1) (mean +/- standard error), which accounts for 81 \% of the C accumulated to the base of the marsh peat layer (67 +/- 9 Mg C ha(-1)). The total C stock is just under one-third of previous global estimates of salt marsh C stocks, likely due to the shallow depth and young age of the marsh. In contrast, the average C accumulation rate (CAR) (184 +/- 50 g C m(-2) yr(-1) to the base of the peat layer) is higher than both CARs from salt marshes along the Pacific coast (112 +/- 12 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and global estimates (91 +/- 7 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). This difference was even more pronounced when we considered individual marsh zones: CARs were significantly greater in high marsh (303 +/- 45 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) compared to the low marsh sediments (63 +/- 6 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), an observation unique to Clayoquot Sound among NE Pacific coast marsh studies. We attribute low CARs in the low marsh zones to shallow-rooting vegetation, reduced terrestrial sediment inputs, negative relative sea level rise in the region, and enhanced erosional processes. Per hectare, CARs in Clayoquot Sound marsh soils are approximately 2-7 times greater than C uptake rates based on net ecosystem productivity in Canadian boreal forests, which highlights their potential importance as C reservoirs and the need to consider their C accumulation capacity as a climate mitigation co-benefit when conserving for other salt marsh ecosystem services.

TI  - Gulf of Mexico estuarine blue carbon stock, extent and flux: Mangroves, marshes, and seagrasses: A North American hotspot
AB  - The Gulf of Mexico blue carbon habitats (mangroves, seagrass, and salt marshes) form an important North American blue carbon hot spot. These habitats cover 2,161,446 ha and grow profusely in estuaries that occupy 38,000 km 2 to store substantial sedimentary organic carbon of 480.48 Tg C. New investigations around GoM for Mexican mangroves, Louisiana salt marshes and seagrasses motivated our integration of buried organic carbon to elucidate a new estimate of GoM blue carbon stocks. Factors creating this include: large GoM watersheds enriching carbon slowly flowing through shallow estuarine habitats with long residence times; fewer SE Mexican hurricanes allowing enhanced carbon storage; mangrove carbon productivity enhanced by warm southern basin winter temperatures; large Preservation reserves amongst high anthropogenic development. The dominant total GoM mangrove blue carbon stock 196.88 Tg from total mangrove extent 650,482 ha is highlighted from new Mexican data. Mexican mangrove organic carbon stock is 112.74 Tg (1st sediment meter) plus USA 84.14 Tg. Mexican mangroves vary greatly in storage, total carbon depositional depths and in sediment age (to 3500 y). We report Mexican mangrove's conservative storage fraction for the normally-compared top meter, whereas the full storage depth estimates ranging above 366.78 Tg (high productivity in very deep sediment along the central Veracruz/Tabasco coast) are not reflected in our reported estimates. Seagrasses stock of 184.1 Tg C organic is derived from 972,327 ha areal extent (in 1st meter). The Louisiana marshes form the heart of GoM salt marsh carbon storage 99.5 Tg (in 1st meter), followed by lesser stocks in Florida, Texas, finally Mexico derived from salt marsh extent totaling 650,482 ha. Constraints on the partial estuarine fluxes given for this new data are discussed as well as widespread anthropogenic destruction of the GoM blue carbon. A new North American comparison of our GoM blue carbon stocks versus Atlantic coastal blue carbon stock estimates is presented. Â© 2018

TI  - Blue Carbon in Coastal Phragmites Wetlands Along the Southern Baltic Sea
AB  - Coastal wetlands are important for carbon (C) storage and sequestration. Still, there are large knowledge gaps concerning the amount of ``blue carbon{''} in coastal wetlands dominated by common reed (Phragmites australis). We quantified carbon stocks at the southern Baltic Sea coast at six representative Phragmites wetland sites at the Darss-Zingst-Bodden Chain (DZBC) and the Strelasund, which include different categories of adjacent land use (arable land, woodland, pasture, urban), topography (totally flat to undulating), and geographical restrictions (dyking). Sediment samples were taken to a depth of 1 m, in line with the IPCC guidelines, and total carbon concentrations and bulk densities were measured in 10 cm intervals. The sites stored, on average, 17.4 kg C m(-2) with large variability between sites, ranging from 1.76 to 88.6 kg C m(-2). The estimated average is generally in good agreement with carbon stocks reported for tidal salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrass meadows. According to our estimation, based on widths of the reed belts and carbon stocks at the sampled sites, approximately 264,600 t of blue carbon could be stored in the coastal reed belts along the DZBC, a typical lagoon system of the southern Baltic Sea. Our study underlines the importance of these unique ecotones between land and sea for storage and sequestration of blue carbon. Since Phragmites is also a common (sometimes invasive) species along other large brackish water basins, such as the Black Sea or Chesapeake Bay, these estimates can be used for improved precision of modeling blue carbon budgets.

TI  - Contribution of soil properties to the assessment of a seawater irrigation programme as a management strategy for abandoned solar saltworks
AB  - The installation of desalination plants close to ecosystems of interest may have environmental impacts that make corrective measures necessary. Especially, wetlands (which are water-dependent ecosystems) are prone to degradation. This is the case for the Agua Amarga salt marsh (SE Spain), that includes an abandoned solar saltworks and surrounding, topographically higher zones, in which the groundwater withdrawal to supply two desalination plants has led to a drop of the piezometric levels and the desiccation of the ecosystem. To overcome these problems, a programme to irrigate the marsh with seawater was established. This paper reports some soil characteristics of the marsh in relation to the different types of vegetation/environment identified and the seawater irrigation programme, with the objective being to propose some guidelines to improve the management of the site. Surface and subsurface samples were taken from 63 plots and the depth of the water level and the soil redox potential (Eh), moisture, electrical conductivity (EC), CaCO3, organic carbon, nitrogen and bulk density were determined. Also, the soil texture, structure, consistence, accumulation of salt crystals and redoximorphic features - indicative of reduction-oxidation processes - were described. The poor structure (weak, granular, subangular and angular blocks, very fine and fine) showed that the soils were hardly developed. The periphery (mainly colonised by Suaeda vera, Lygeum spartum and Limonium spp.) was less saline (EC 1:5 in the upper layers similar to 0.4 to similar to 4 dS m(-1)) and drier (water level > -1.5 m depth) than the abandoned saline ponds (EC 1:5 in the upper layers similar to 2 to similar to 9 dS m(-1) and water level between -1 m depth and +0.2 m above the soil surface), mainly colonised by Sarcocornia fruticosa, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, Salicornia patula, Phragmites australis and Ruppia maritima in the flooded ponds. The soils of the periphery were always oxic (Eh > + 500 mV), but most of the abandoned saline ponds had suboxic (similar to + 100 mV < Eh < similar to +350 mV) and even anoxic conditions (Eh < similar to +100 mV), as shown by the existence of gley colours and redoximorphic features. The soil bulk density of the surface and subsurface layers showed that the most impermeable ponds were located in the centre of the marsh, where it is possible to maintain a surface water sheet during prolonged periods, suitable for the development of submerged plant species such as R. maritima and for waterbirds. Part of the seawater poured into more permeable ponds, such as those located in the southern and northern zones of the marsh, is lost by infiltration due to the lower bulk density of these soils. The latter facilitates the recovery of the piezometric levels and the growth of terrestrial plant species. Monitoring of redoximorphic features in the upper soil layers, in combination with symptoms of damage in the plants, could be used as a visual indicator of oxygen limitation due to excessive soil moisture. This would permit the regulation of the irrigation programme, hence optimising the energy and economic resources applied to maintain the ecosystem. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Carbon offset market methodologies applicable for coastal wetland restoration and conservation in the United States: A review
AB  - Coastal wetlands have been valued for a variety of ecosystem services including carbon sequestration and long term storage. The carbon sequestered and stored in coastal habitat including mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds is termed as blue carbon. However, these systems are threatened mainly due to sea level rise, limited sediment supply, edge erosion, and anthropogenic influences. These habitats require restoration and conservation to continue providing ecosystem services. The incentive for emission reductions, referred to as carbon offsets, is well established for other ecosystems like forestry and agriculture. Some blue carbon offset methodologies or protocols have been certified by various voluntary carbon markets; however to date, a few wetland restoration carbon offset in the US has been transacted. Thus, the goal of this paper is to discuss the existing carbon market and carbon market methodologies applicable to coastal wetland restoration and conservation in the US. Currently, four wetland carbon offset methodologies have been approved in the carbon market. These methodologies are site and/or project-specific depending on the type of the wetlands, vulnerability to loss, and restoration need. The appropriate carbon stock and Green House Gas (GHG) emission assessment is the basis of determining carbon offsets. Simplification of the existing methodologies and development of new site and project-specific methodologies could potentially help to realize blue carbon offsets in practice. The slowly growing demand for carbon offsets in the carbon market could potentially be fulfilled from the blue carbon pool. While this carbon offset is in the early stages, this review may help the inclusion of carbon offset component in the coastal restoration and conservation projects in United States and potentially across the globe.

TI  - Incorporating coastal blue carbon into subnational greenhouse gas inventories
AB  - The climate mitigation potential of coastal blue carbon including mangroves, seagrasses and tidal marshes have been widely recognized, and guidelines for incorporating coastal wetlands into greenhouse gas inventories released by IPCC in 2014 make it possible to bring coastal blue carbon into multilevel climate governance regimes. However, the intricate guidelines and inadequate data block governments from accounting and reporting their coastal blue carbon in inventories. In this research, we integrated and simplified the equations and assumptions of IPCC inventory guidance on coastal wetlands, and took Hainan province of China as a case study by (1) formulating a land use change matrix from high resolution satellite imagery for the years of 2010 to 2020, (2) compiling dataset of emission factors for coastal wetlands of Hainan, and (3) estimating CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from coastal wetlands in Hainan. We reveal that the mangroves' area increased from 4,190.7 ha in 2010 to 4,644.1 ha in 2020, with a net increase of 483.9 ha from tidal flats and aquaculture ponds. The weighted average EFAGB and EFsoil of Hainan is 61.7 MgC ha(-1) and 227.4 MgC ha(-1), respectively,estimated from peer-reviewed literature in both Chinese and English. The annual average net CO2 emission of mangroves of Hainan is -26974.3 MgCO(2)e yr(-1). CO2 emission from mangrove deforestation and N2O emission from shrimp aquaculture in coastal aeras may offset the efforts of coastal wetlands conservation and restoration. Countries and sub-country regions are encouraged to bring coastal blue carbon into greenhouse gases inventories as soon as possible, and to take a bottom-up strategy to initiate the task at a local level.

TI  - Blue carbon stocks and exchanges along the California coast
AB  - Salt marshes and seagrass meadows can sequester and store high quantities of organic carbon (OC) in their sediments relative to other marine and terrestrial habitats. Assessing carbon stocks, carbon sources, and the transfer of carbon between habitats within coastal seascapes are each integral in identifying the role of blue carbon habitats in coastal carbon cycling. Here, we quantified carbon stocks, sources, and exchanges in seagrass meadows, salt marshes, and unvegetated sediments in six bays along the California coast. In the top 20 cm of sediment, the salt marshes contained approximately twice as much OC as seagrass meadows did, 4.92 +/- 0.36 kg OC m(-2) compared to 2.20 +/- 0.24 kg OC m(-2), respectively. Both salt marsh and seagrass sediment carbon stocks were higher than previous estimates from this region but lower than global and US-wide averages, respectively. Seagrass-derived carbon was deposited annually into adjacent marshes during fall seagrass senescence. However, isotope mixing models estimate that negligible amounts of this seagrass material were ultimately buried in underlying sediment. Rather, the vast majority of OC in sediment across sites was likely derived from planktonic/benthic diatoms and/or C-3 salt marsh plants.

TI  - Decomposition of vascular plants and carbon mineralization in coastal wetlands
AB  - This chapter discusses factors affecting processes of litter decomposition in coastal wetlands, including biotic, abiotic, as well as anthropogenic factors. A few indicators of litter decomposition are used to describe litter disappearance, including decomposition rate, mass loss percentage, half-life time, and residence time. We examine the variability of leaf litter, wood and root decomposition due to factors such as media for decomposition experiment, stoichiometry, and ecosystem types. Leaf litter decomposes at significantly higher decomposition rate in the aerial (0.06Â±0.018dayâˆ’1) than the aquatic environment (0.025Â±0.007dayâˆ’1) for mangroves, while nonsignificant differences are found for saltmarshes. There is a significant negative relationship between leaf litter decomposition rate constant and leaf litter C/N ratio for both mangroves and saltmarshes. Both leaf and root decomposition rates differ among wetland geomorphology due to differences in biotic and hydrological conditions. Relatively few studies examine the decomposition of wood compared with leaf litter and roots, but generally mangrove wood is more recalcitrant than leaf tissues. The fate of root carbon in mangroves and saltmarshes is revealed with emitted carbon gases accounting for 27.3% of belowground carbon mineralization for mangroves but unknown for saltmarsh due to the paucity of data. Sediment organic matter in coastal wetlands consists of diversified organic compounds, including carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and phenols, which are classified into labile or humic substances. Organic matter mineralization involves the breakdown of large to small molecule weight organic compounds and eventually to carbon gases (i.e., CO2 and CH4) via various aerobic and anaerobic pathways. Free energy yields determine the likelihood of the reactions of CH4 and CO2 production. Carbon mineralization is related to a series of processes, including inorganic carbon dynamics and sedimentation in coastal wetlands. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Crab bioturbation drives coupled iron-phosphate-sulfide cycling in mangrove and salt marsh soils
AB  - Coastal wetlands sequestering abundant blue carbon in soils are biogeochemical hotspots and critical habitats for benthic animals like invertebrate fiddler crabs. Here, we reveal how crab bioturbation (i.e., burrowing activity) drives the redox geochemistry of ferrous iron (Fe(II)), phosphate (PO43-), and sulfide (S(-II)) under contrasting vegetation types and hydrological conditions. We used in-situ approaches of diffusive gradients in thin films to perform detailed mm-scale burrow observations in two subtropical wetlands with a vegetation gradient of mudflat-salt marsh-mangrove. Burrow flushing caused a top-down hydrologic connectivity through the crab burrows and thus created a deep depth for the occurrence of Fe(III) reduction and sulfate reduction which were accompanied by P mobilization. The burrow oxidation zone, indicated by lower concentrations of Fe(II), PO43- and S(-II), were shallower in mudflats and salt marshes than in mangroves due to the unique respiratory roots of mangrove plants. The redox of Fe(II), PO(4)(3-)and S(-II) in crab burrow was insensitive to the convection flow induced input of dissolved oxygen through the surrounding soil matrix, indicating the burrow soil is an independent microenvironment. Crab burrowing activities favored Fe-S coupling which is conductive the formation of pyrite and alkalinity generation. Overall, our in-situ high-resolution observations and porewater hydraulic dynamics revealed spatially variable soil geochemistry, active coupled cycling of Fe-P-S in crab burrows, and mm-scale hotspots of redox cycling within burrows.

TI  - Vascular Plants Are Globally Significant Contributors to Marine Carbon Fluxes and Sinks
AB  - More than two-thirds of global biomass consists of vascular plants. A portion of the detritus they generate is carried into the oceans from land and highly productive blue carbon ecosystems-salt marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows. This large detrital input receives scant attention in current models of the global carbon cycle, though for blue carbon ecosystems, increasingly well-constrained estimates of biomass, productivity, and carbon fluxes, reviewed in this article, are now available. We show that the fate of this detritus differs markedly from that of strictly marine origin, because the former contains lignocellulose-an energy-rich polymer complex of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin that is resistant to enzymatic breakdown. This complex can be depolymerized for nutritional purposes by specialized marine prokaryotes, fungi, protists, and invertebrates using enzymes such as glycoside hydrolases and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases to release sugar monomers. The lignin component, however, is less readily depolymerized, and detritus therefore becomes lignin enriched, particularly in anoxic sediments, and forms a major carbon sink in blue carbon ecosystems. Eventual lignin breakdown releases a wide variety of small molecules that may contribute significantly to the oceanic pool of recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon. Marine carbon fluxes and sinks dependent on lignocellulosic detritus are important ecosystem services that are vulnerable to human interventions. These services must be considered when protecting blue carbon ecosystems and planning initiatives aimed at mitigating anthropogenic carbon emissions. Â© 2020 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mangrove carbon sequestration and sediment deposition changes under cordgrass invasion
AB  - Mangroves and tidal saltmarshes are known for their considerable capacity to store carbon (C). Mangrove-saltmarsh ecotones have high dynamics in C cycling based on some evidence of mangroves encroaching into saltmarshes. The mangrove encroachment may also increase the surface elevation, enhance C storage, and further change the ecosystem services. In China, an exotic Spartina alterniflora (cordgrass) introduced from the East Coast of the United States has been extensively invading mangrove wetlands. During this situation, the C dynamics and associated sedimentary processes within the mangrove wetlands under cordgrass invasion are largely unknown. In this chapter, we discuss the biochemical and ecogeomorphological feedbacks related to surface sediment C and discuss the biological factors affecting sediment C flux, vegetation-sediment interaction, and the consequent sedimentary processes. We assess the change in C stocks after cordgrass invaded mangroves in the Yunxiao Estuary and present a conceptual model of C dynamics and the evaluation of regional C storage in typical mangrove-Spartina ecotones. The invasion of cordgrass can increase the sediment deposition and enhance the surface elevation on the edges of mangrove-Spartina ecotones, which has a positive feedback on their further expansion to the mudflat. Thus, cordgrass invasion in mudflats would enhance sediment C stocks. However, the long-term studies of the C dynamics in mangrove-Spartina ecotones still require truly interdisciplinary approaches of biology, biochemistry, and ecogeomorphology. Â© 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - RGB Indices and Canopy Height Modelling for Mapping Tidal Marsh Biomass from a Small Unmanned Aerial System
AB  - Coastal tidal marshes are essential ecosystems for both economic and ecological reasons. They necessitate regular monitoring as the effects of climate change begin to be manifested in changes to marsh vegetation healthiness. Small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) build upon previously established remote sensing techniques to monitor a variety of vegetation health metrics, including biomass, with improved flexibility and affordability of data acquisition. The goal of this study was to establish the use of RGB-based vegetation indices for mapping and monitoring tidal marsh vegetation (i.e., Spartina alterniflora) biomass. Flights over tidal marsh study sites were conducted using a multi-spectral camera on a quadcopter sUAS near vegetation peak growth. A number of RGB indices were extracted to build a non-linear biomass model. A canopy height model was developed using sUAS-derived digital surface models and LiDAR-derived digital terrain models to assess its contribution to the biomass model. Results found that the distance-based RGB indices outperformed the regular radio-based indices in coastal marshes. The best-performing biomass models used the triangular greenness index (TGI; R-2 = 0.39) and excess green index (ExG; R-2 = 0.376). The estimated biomass revealed high biomass predictions at the fertilized marsh plots in the Long-Term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB) project at the study site. The sUAS-extracted canopy height was not statistically significant in biomass estimation but showed similar explanatory power to other studies. Due to the lack of biomass samples in the inner estuary, the proposed biomass model in low marsh does not perform as well as the high marsh that is close to shore and accessible for biomass sampling. Further research of low marsh is required to better understand the best conditions for S. alterniflora biomass estimation using sUAS as an on-demand, personal remote sensing tool.

TI  - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange and its controlling factors during the growing season in an inter-tidal salt marsh in the Yellow River Estuary, China
AB  - Inter-tidal salt marsh plays a great important role in the global carbon cycle as a considerable potential capacity of the carbon sink. Compared to other types of wetlands, the inter-tidal salt marsh has a unique biogeochemical process under the combined action between freshwater and seawater. Therefore, there is considerable variability and uncertainty in its net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE). However, few studies provide insights regarding the variability of NEE and its controlling factors in an inter-tidal salt marsh. Using the Eddy Covariance (EC) technique, we analyzed temporal variation in NEE and determined its control mechanisms coupled with meteorological and tidal inundation variables during the growing season (from April to October) of 2012 in an inter-tidal salt marsh in the Yellow River Estuary. The results showed that it was net CO2 absorption in the daytime and net CO2 release in the nighttime on a diurnal scale. The daily average NEE during the growing season was -0.38 g CO2 m-2 d-1, with a maximum daily CO2 uptake rate of -3.13 g CO2 m-2 d-1(June 27) and a maximum release rate of 1.47 g CO2 m-2 d-1(August 12). The monthly average NEE increased rapidly from May, and peaked in June, then decreasing gradually from July. The maximum monthly ecosystem respiration (Reco) was 15.16 g C/ m2 in June when the hightest soil temperature was 27.5 Â°C. The monthly gross primary productivity (GPP) reached its peaking value (25.07 g C/ m2) in July. During the growing season, NEE was mainly dominated by photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), soil temperature (Ts), soil water content (SWC) and tidal inundation. There was a rectangular hyperbolic relationship between the daytime net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEEdaytime) and PAR. The maximum ecosystem apparent quantum yield (Î±) and maximum photosynthesis rate (NEEsat) appeared in June ((0.0086Â±0.0019) Î¼mol CO2 Î¼mol-1 photons) and in May ((4.79Â±1.52) Î¼mol CO2 m-2 s-1), respectively. In addition, NEEdaytime also was positively correlated with Ts and SWC. During the growing season, NEEdaytime had an exponential relationship with Ts. The mean value of Q10 was 1.33, and it was positively related to SWC. During the typical sunny day of June 19 to June 25, tidal inundation enhanced daytime net absorption of CO2 and nighttime CO2 release. As a result, tidal inundation increased the net ecosystem CO2 absorption by an average of 0.76 g CO2 m-2 d-1. During the growing season, the inter-tidal salt marsh was an obvious CO2sink (22.28 g C/ m2), with a cumulative emission of 96.28 g C/ m2 and a cumulative aborption of 118.34 g C/ m2.

TI  - Beyond burial: Lateral exchange is a significant atmospheric carbon sink in mangrove forests
AB  - The blue carbon paradigm has evolved in recognition of the high carbon storage and sequestration potential of mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass ecosystems. However, fluxes of the potent greenhouse gases CH4 and N2O, and lateral export of carbon are often overlooked within the blue carbon framework. Here, we show that the export of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and alkalinity is approximately 1.7 times higher than burial as a long-term carbon sink in a subtropical mangrove system. Fluxes of methane offset burial by approximately 6%, while the nitrous oxide sink was approximately 0.5% of burial. Export of dissolved organic carbon and particulate organic carbon to the coastal zone is also significant and combined may account for an atmospheric carbon sink similar to burial. Our results indicate that the export of DIC and alkalinity results in a long-term atmospheric carbon sink and should be incorporated into the blue carbon paradigm when assessing the role of these habitats in sequestering carbon and mitigating climate change.

TI  - Economic Value of Salt Marshes under Uncertainty ofÂ Sea Level Rise: A Case Study of the Narragansett Bay
AB  - Salt marshes are an integral part of coastal ecosystems that are changing rapidly with sea level rise (SLR). Because marshes provide important ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration and shoreline protection, it is critical to understand how their economic benefit values are likely to be affected by SLR. Such change, however, depends on the capacity of marshes to adapt to flooding by migrating inland. This study provides the economic value of changes in carbon and non-carbon benefits using predicted changes in salt marsh coverage in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island under three SLR scenarios and two marsh adaptation conditions. We apply regional carbon prices and a value function transfer approach to value other salt marsh service values. Results indicate an average annual value of $1,863/acre for carbon and $2,537/acre for non-carbon ecosystem services. This yields a mean discounted value of $592 million (M) (+14% compared to no change) over 90 years. We discuss alternative management strategies to enhance marshesâ€™ capacity to migrate inland, which may accrue as much as $659 M. Â© 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Valuing the contribution of blue carbon to small island developing states' climate change commitments and Covid-19 recovery
AB  - Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face complex socio-economic and environmental threats, making them particularly vulnerable to climate change. Blue Carbon (BC) ecosystems (mangrove forests, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows) provide climate regulation services by sequestering and storing carbon, presenting an opportunity for SIDS to address climate change and implement Paris Agreement commitments in their Covid-19 recovery. BC habitat decline not only reduces carbon sequestration benefits provided, but can also result in sediment disturbance and the release of previously stored carbon back into the atmosphere. In this work, a scenario analysis informed by a stakeholder workshop and scientific and socio-economic expectations is used to assess the economic importance of Grenada's BC (mangroves and seagrasses) over the next 10, 25 and 50 years. Our findings indicate that sequestration benefits are severely diminished under Business-as-Usual habitat loss, but still marginally outweigh losses from carbon emissions, with overall welfare gains of US$0.5â€“1.9 million over 50 years. To stimulate economic recovery post-pandemic, stakeholders anticipated a realistic scenario of increased habitat decline resulting in overall losses of US$5.4â€“19.4 million in the next 50 years. However, if ecosystems are maintained, overall carbon benefits could reach US$10.7 million, while a 20% increase in mangroves over the next 25 years provides benefits reaching US$11.1 million between 2020 and 2070. These results demonstrate a significant increase in value when BC ecosystems are maintained and not disturbed, preventing the release of previously stored carbon and enhancing sequestration capacity. Restoration benefits are marginal, compared to conservation, supporting claims that conservation is more cost effective. Â© 2022

TI  - Sea-level rise will reduce net CO2 uptake in subtropical coastal marshes
AB  - Coastal marshes have a significant capacity to sequester carbon; however, sea-level rise (SLR) is expected to result in prolonged flooding and saltwater intrusion in coastal regions. To explore the effects of SLR projections on net CO2 uptake in coastal marshes, we conducted a â€œdouble-checkâ€ investigation, including the eddy covariance (EC) measurements of the CO2 fluxes in subtropical coastal marshes along inundation and salinity gradients, in combination with a mesocosm experiment for analyzing CO2 flux components under waterlogging and increased salinity conditions. During the same measurement periods, the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEEEC based on the EC dataset) in an oligohaline marsh was higher than that in a low-elevation mesohaline marsh, whereas the NEEEC was lower than that in a high-elevation freshwater marsh. The declines in NEEEC between the marshes could be attributed to a greater decrease in gross primary production relative to ecosystem respiration. Waterlogging slightly increased the NEEms (NEE based on the mesocosms) because of inhibited soil respiration and slight changes in plant photosynthesis and shoot respiration. However, the NEEms measured during the drainage period decreased significantly due to the stimulated soil respiration. The NEEms decreased with increasing salinity (except under mild salinity), and waterlogging exacerbated the adverse impacts of salinity. The amplificatory effect of decreases in both leaf photosynthesis and growth under hydrological stresses contributed more to reduce the NEEms than to respiratory effluxes. Both waterlogging and increased salinity reduced the root biomass, soil microbial biomass, and activities of assayed soil enzymes (except for cellulase under waterlogging conditions), leading to limited soil respiration. The declines in plant growth, photosynthesis, and soil respiration could also be attributed to the decrease in soil nutrients under waterlogging and increased salinity conditions. We propose that the coupling of SLR-driven hydrological effects lowers the capacity of CO2 uptake in subtropical coastal marshes. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Spatial and temporal heterogeneity of geochemical controls on carbon cycling in a tidal salt marsh
AB  - Tidal salt marsh ecosystems store copious amounts of carbon (C) within sediments. In order to predict how these C stores may be affected by environmental change, it is critical to assess current CO 2 and CH 4 production and efflux from these ecosys- tems. Production and efflux of these greenhouse gases (GHGs) are governed by coupled geochemical, hydrological, physical and biological processes in sediments that are sensitive to local conditions, which can result in large spatial and temporal heterogeneity of GHGs dynamics within the ecosystem. To understand how the drivers of GHGs dynamics vary across salt marsh ecosystems, we coupled solid-phase geochemistry to measurements of porewater chemistry (to-1 m), CO2 and CH4 production in sediments and efflux to the atmosphere in a temperate tidal salt marsh for over one year to capture seasonal patterns within two vegetation zones of the marsh landscape that have distinct biogeochemical and hydrologic conditions: Tall Spartina (TS) and Short Spartina (SS). The SS vegetation zone experienced nearly constant inundation, low redox values (-200 to 200 mV), porewater pH 6-7 that did not vary with depth or time, an enrichment of pyrite and goethite with depth and up to 3 mM porewater sulfide. In contrast, the TS vegetation zone on the natural levee proximal to a tidal channel expe- rienced large water level oscillations due to spring-neap tides that resulted in variable but higher redox values (0-700 mV), porewater pH 6-7 at depth but surface (0-3 cm) as low as 4 in the spring, an enrichment of ferrihydrite and a depletion of pyrite at-30 cm, and up to 0.8 mM ferrous Fe in porewater. At 50-56 cm, solid phase analyses (STXM-NEXAFS) revealed differential C speciation between the two vegetation zones, with stronger C-Fe spatial association at TS and stronger C-Ca co- association at SS despite both having similar soil pH of 3-4. These results suggest that soil pH may not be strongly predictive of C-mineral control in flooded marsh sediments. Both vegetation zones showed consistent CO2 and CH4 emissions from sed- iments to the atmosphere throughout the study period with TS having-60\% higher median CO 2 and SS having-55\% higher median CH 4 efflux. Using depth profiling, unexpectedly high concentrations of CO 2 (>200 lM) and CH 4 (>200 lM) were observed at depths 50-75 cm at both zones that were higher for SS in these sulfate-rich (up to 17 mM) sediments, which sug- gests methylotrophic methanogenesis occurs deep within the profile of salt marsh sediments away from the tidal channel. Moreover, if we extrapolate our median depth values of CH 4 and CO 2 to the 5.3 Mha of global salt marshes, this could account for a conservative estimate of-70 Gg of unaccounted C stored in gaseous form (i.e., CH 4 and CO 2 ) in marsh sed- iments, which should be considered when attempting to understand the current patterns and future responses of carbon dynamics from these ecosystems.

TI  - Study quantifies living shores carbon sequestration
AB  - The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration study published in December 2015 shows that living shorelines can help sequester CO2 and potentially help combat climate change. This is the first to quantify the amount of carbon that can be sequestered in living shorelines, which usually are engineered using natural materials such as plants, sand and rock. Using core samples, researchers measured the amount of carbon stored in salt-marsh sediments and compared storage rates in marshes of different ages in North Carolina?s Newport River Estuary. The researchers have concluded that the long-term potential of sandy, living shorelines is similar to natural marshes in the Southeast.

TI  - Keys to successful blue carbon projects: Lessons learned from global case studies
AB  - Ecosystem services such as protection from storms and erosion, tourism benefits, and climate adaptation and mitigation have been increasingly recognized as important considerations for environmental policymalcing. Recent research has shown that coastal ecosystems such as seagrasses, salt marshes, and mangroves provide climate mitigation services because they are particularly effective at sequestering and storing carbon dioxide, referred to as ``coastal blue carbon{''}. Unfortunately, degradation of blue carbon ecosystems due to anthropogenic impacts contributes to anthropogenic carbon emissions from land use impacts and prevents these ecosystems from continuing to sequester and store carbon. Given the impressive carbon sequestration and storage in coastal ecosystems, many countries with blue carbon resources are beginning to implement blue carbon restoration projects using carbon financing mechanisms. This study analyzed four case studies of projects in Kenya, India, Vietnam, and Madagascar, evaluating the individual carbon financing mechanisms, the project outcomes, and the policy implications of each. Strengths and challenges of implementing blue carbon projects are discussed and considerations that all projects should address are examined in order to develop long-term sustainable climate mitigation or adaptation policies. This analysis can help to inform future project design considerations as well as policy opportunities. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Porewater-Derived Blue Carbon Outwelling and Greenhouse Gas Emissions in a Subtropical Multi-Species Saltmarsh
AB  - Saltmarshes can sequester atmospheric CO2 in sediments, but limited studies have quantified porewater-derived carbon exports and identified related carbon sources. Here, we estimated porewater exchange, carbon outwelling, and greenhouse gas emissions in a subtropical multi-species saltmarsh. The radon-based porewater exchange rate was estimated to be 5.60 +/- 2.78 cm d(-1). As the most dominant (\~{}90\%) carbon species, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) fluxes through porewater exchange and outwelling were 447 +/- 227 and 1200 +/- 61 mmol m(-2) d(-1), respectively, which were 1.2 and 3.2 times that of carbon burial. As most DIC can remain in the ocean for a long time, porewater-derived DIC outwelling represents another important carbon sink, in addition to carbon burial. CO2 and CH4 emissions from creek water were 54.6 +/- 0.5 and 0.19 +/- 0.01 mmol m(-2) d(-1), respectively, which could offset 16\% of carbon burial. The delta C-13 and C/N ratios suggest that saltmarsh organic carbon mainly originates from the C3 plant Scirpus mariqueter rather than the C4 plant Spartina alterniflora. Overall, we suggest that porewater-derived DIC outwelling is an important long-term carbon sink in multi-species saltmarshes, providing a scientific basis for the protection and restoration of saltmarshes in the context of global climate change.

TI  - Ecosystem Level Methane Fluxes from Tidal Freshwater and Brackish Marshes of the Mississippi River Delta: Implications for Coastal Wetland Carbon Projects
AB  - Sulfate from seawater inhibits methane production in tidal wetlands, and by extension, salinity has been used as a general predictor of methane emissions. With the need to reduce methane flux uncertainties from tidal wetlands, eddy covariance (EC) techniques provide an integrated methane budget. The goals of this study were to: 1) establish methane emissions from natural, freshwater and brackish wetlands in Louisiana based on EC; and 2) determine if EC estimates conform to a methane-salinity relationship derived from temperate tidal wetlands with chamber sampling. Annual estimates of methane emissions from this study were 62.3Â g CH4/m2/yr and 13.8Â g CH4/m2/yr for the freshwater and brackish (8â€“10Â psu) sites, respectively. If it is assumed that long-term, annual soil carbon sequestration rates of natural marshes are ~200Â g C/m2/yr (7.3 tCO2e/ha/yr), healthy brackish marshes could be expected to act as a net radiative sink, equivalent to less than one-half the soil carbon accumulation rate after subtracting methane emissions (4.1 tCO2e/ha/yr). Carbon sequestration rates would need case-by-case assessment, but the EC methane emissions estimates in this study conformed well to an existing salinity-methane model that should serve as a basis for establishing emission factors for wetland carbon offset projects.

TI  - Refining Estimates of Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Salt Marsh ``Blue Carbon{''} Erosion and Decomposition
AB  - Coastal wetlands have sediments that contain organic matter preserved against decomposition for timespans that can range up to millennia. This ``blue carbon{''} in wetland sediments has been proposed as a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide and a potential source of greenhouse gases if coastal habitats are lost. A missing gap in the role of coastal habitats in the global carbon cycle is elucidating the fate of wetland sediment carbon following disturbance events, such as erosion, that can liberate organic matter to an oxygenated environment where decomposition can more readily occur. Here, we track the fate of previously stored salt marsh sediment by measuring the production of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) during an oxygenated incubation. Sediments from two depth horizons (5-10 cm and 20-25 cm) were incubated at two temperatures (20 and 30 degrees C) for 161 days. Q(10) of the decomposition process over the entire course of the experiment was 2.0 +/- 0.1 and 2.2 +/- 0.2 for shallow and deep horizons, respectively. Activation energy for the decomposition reaction (49.7 kJ . mol(-1) and 58.8 kJ . mol(-1) for shallow and deep sediment horizons, respectively) was used to calculate temperature-specific decomposition rates that could be applied to environmental data. Using high-frequency water temperature data, this strategy was applied to coastal states in the conterminous United States (CONUS) where we estimated annual in situ decomposition of eroded salt marsh organic matter as 7-24\% loss per year. We estimate 62.90 +/- 2.81 Gg C . yr(-1) is emitted from eroded salt marsh sediment decomposition in the CONUS.

TI  - Benthic Biofilm Potential for Organic Carbon Accumulation in Salt Marsh Sediments
AB  - Coastal salt marshes are productive environments with high potential for carbon accumulation and storage. Even though organic carbon in salt marsh sediment is typically attributed to plant biomass, it can also be produced by benthic photosynthetic biofilms. These biofilms, generally composed of diatoms and their secretions, are known for their high primary productivity and contribution to the basal food web. The growth of biofilms and the preservation of carbon produced by biofilms depends on the amount of sedimentation; low sedimentation rates will favor decomposition, while high sedimentation rates could decrease biofilm productivity. In this study, we conducted laboratory experiments to test (1) if biofilms can potentially accumulate carbon in marsh soil and (2) how different sedimentation rates affect the amount of carbon accumulation. Containers filled with a settled mud bed were inoculated with natural biofilms collected from a marsh surface and allowed to grow with favorable light exposure, nutrient supply, and absence of grazing. Mud was added weekly in different amounts, resulting in an equivalent sedimentation rate from 12 to 189 mm/yr After 11 weeks, the sediment columns were sampled and analyzed for ch1 a, organic matter via loss on ignition (LOI), and total organic carbon (TOC). Ch1 a accumulation rates ranged from 123 to 534 mg/cm(2)/yr, organic matter accumulation ranged from 86 to 456 g/m(2)/yr, and TOC accumulation rates ranged from 31 to 211 g/m(2)/yr. These values are on the same order of magnitude of marsh carbon accumulation rates measured in the field. All three metrics (ch1 a, organic matter, and TOC) increased with increased sedimentation rate. These results show that biofilms can potentially contribute to carbon accumulation in salt marsh soils. Furthermore, areas with high sedimentation rates have the potential for higher amounts of organic matter from biofilms in the sediment.

TI  - Effects of nitrogen input on carbon cycle and carbon budget in a coastal salt marsh
AB  - Coastal salt marshes are an effective blue carbon sink to mitigate climate warming, but their ecosystem stability and carbon sink function are threatened by the large amount of nitrogen input caused by coastal eutrophication. Under the action of regular tides, the high nitrogen content in the coastal waters will have a profound effect on the key processes of carbon cycle such as plant photosynthetic carbon fixation, carbon allocation in plant-soil system, and soil carbon release in the salt marsh. This study reviewed the effects of nitrogen input on plant photosynthetic carbon fixation, carbon allocation in plant-soil system, decomposition of soil organic carbon, formation and release of soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and carbon sequestration in the salt marsh. Based on the shortcomings of current research, this review proposed the directions of future research, including the effects of nitrogen input on plant photosynthetic carbon fixation and carbon allocation in plant-soil system, the microbial mechanism of soil organic carbon decomposition, production and lateral exchange of soil DOC, and the potential impact of different forms of nitrogen input on soil carbon sequestration in the salt marsh. Overall, this study aims to improve the understanding of impacts of nitrogen input on the key carbon processes and the mechanisms of carbon sequestration in a salt marsh, and to provide new ideas for assessing the potential changes of carbon pools under the influence of eutrophication of coastal waters in the salt marsh wetlands.

TI  - Long-term fate of rapidly eroding carbon stock soil profiles in coastal wetlands
AB  - Marsh edge erosion is one of the major causes of land and associated carbon loss in wetland-dominated coastlines. Assessing carbon stocks and understanding fate of eroding carbon is an essential component of wetland carbon budget. This study aims to understand the vertical soil carbon profile of an eroding marsh and potential mineralization of carbon in estuaries. Eleven soil cores (~2 m deep) were collected from the edge of four highly eroding marsh sites and three cores from the estuarine bottom (~50 cm deep). Cores were sectioned into 10-cm intervals and analyzed for total, labile and refractory carbon, carbon density, select enzyme and microbial activities, and organic and inorganic phosphorus forms. The total carbon, labile carbon, and carbon density increased with depth at all sites. The carbon density at 1â€“1.5 m deep (0.04 Â± 0.003 g cmâˆ’3) was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.0001) than the top 1 m soil (0.032 Â± 0.002 g cmâˆ’3), indicating the need for considering deeper carbon profile for blue carbon stock assessment. The age of the carbon at the estuarine bottom was 388 Â± 84 years before present (ybp) indicating the recently eroded wetland carbon is not reburied in the estuary. Significant anaerobic microbial activity was present at all the soil depths suggesting high potential of mineralization of eroded carbon in the aerobic estuarine water. The coastlines experiencing high relative sea-level rise at present or coastlines that are projecting high sea-level rise in the near future are susceptible to losing an enormous amount of previously sequestered carbon over a relatively short period of time.

TI  - Direct and indirect effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on net ecosystem production in a Chesapeake Bay tidal wetland
AB  - The rapid increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations (Ca) has resulted in extensive research efforts to understand its impact on terrestrial ecosystems, especially carbon balance. Despite these efforts, there are relatively few data comparing net ecosystem exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and the biosphere (NEE), under both ambient and elevated Ca. Here we report data on annual sums of CO2 (NEEnet) for 19 years on a Chesapeake Bay tidal wetland for Scirpus olneyi (C3 photosynthetic pathway)- and Spartina patens (C4 photosynthetic pathway)-dominated high marsh communities exposed to ambient and elevated Ca (ambient + 340 ppm). Our objectives were to (i) quantify effects of elevated Ca on seasonally integrated CO2 assimilation (NEEnet = NEEday + NEEnight, kg C m-2 y-1) for the two communities; and (ii) quantify effects of altered canopy N content on ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration. Across all years, NEEnet averaged 1.9 kg m-2 y-1 in ambient Ca and 2.5 kg m-2 y-1 in elevated Ca, for the C3-dominated community. Similarly, elevated Ca significantly (P &lt; 0.01) increased carbon uptake in the C4-dominated community, as NEEnet averaged 1.5 kg m-2 y-1 in ambient Ca and 1.7 kg m-2 y-1 in elevated Ca. This resulted in an average CO2 stimulation of 32% and 13% of seasonally integrated NEEnet for the C3- and C4-dominated communities, respectively. Increased NEEday was correlated with increased efficiencies of light and nitrogen use for net carbon assimilation under elevated Ca, while decreased NEEnight was associated with lower canopy nitrogen content. These results suggest that rising Ca may increase carbon assimilation in both C3- and C4-dominated wetland communities. The challenge remains to identify the fate of the assimilated carbon.

TI  - Distribution of soil carbon storage in different saltmarsh plant communities in Chongming Dongtan wetland
AB  - The high productivity of saltmarsh vegetation in coastal wetlands plays an important role on the formation of soil carbon pool. This paper studied the biomass difference, the spatiotemporal dynamics and vertical distribution of soil carbon storage in three dominant saltmarsh plant communities, i.e., Phragmites australis, Spartina alterniflora and Scirpus mariqueter in the Chongming Dongtan wetland, in the Yangtze Estuary. The results indicated that the gross biomass in the three saltmarsh plant communities was in the order of S. alterniflora (5750.7 gÂ·m-2) &gt; P. australis (4655.1 gÂ·m-2) &gt; S. mariqueter (812.7 gÂ·m-2). The aboveground biomass was the highest in summer and autumn, and the underground biomass was the highest in winter. The soil carbon storage (0-50 cm) was the lowest in spring, gradually increased, and was the highest in winter. The annual increment of soil carbon storage decreased from the high tidal zone to the low tidal zone, and was in the order of P. australis community (711.8 g Â· m-2) &gt; S. alterniflora community (646.2 gÂ·m-2)&gt; S. mariqueter community (185.3 gÂ·m-2) &gt; bare mudflat (65.6 gÂ·m-2). The highest value was in the 25-30 cm, 10-15 cm, 30-35 cm and 30-40 cm soil layers for bare mudflat and the S. mariqueter, S. alterniflora and P. australis communities, respectively. There was a significant linear relationship between the soil carbon storage and the underground biomass in the different saltmarsh communities.

TI  - Soil organic matter (SOM) effects on infaunal community structure in restored and created tidal marshes
AB  - Accumulation of significant quantities of organic matter is an important characteristic of anaerobic soils that influences the physical, chemical and biological processes of wetland ecosystems, Organic matter effects include soil water holding capacity, porosity, nutrient storage, nutrient cycling and species composition and abundance of sediment-dwelling invertebrates. These infauna are thought to be important links in transferring primary production from the marsh to the estuarine food web. Tidal marsh restoration and creation often occur on mineral soils that contain little or no organic carbon, and research results indicate that low SOM contents are associated with lower functional value of wetlands. The objectives of this paper are to review the literature and assess the relationship of SOM quantity and quality to functional value of created and restored tidal marshes relative to natural reference marshes. This assessment includes rate of accumulation of organic matter, comparison of carbon and nutrient pools in natural and created marshes, the relationship of organic matter to species composition and abundance of infauna, and the potential for accelerating functional development by adding organic amendments to the soil.

TI  - Using Hydrological-Biogeochemical Linkages to Elucidate Carbon Dynamics in Coastal Marshes Subject to Relative Sea Level Rise
AB  - Coastal marshes are an important component of the global carbon cycle, yet our understanding of how these ecosystems will respond to sea level rise (SLR) is limited. Coastal marsh hydrology varies based on elevation, distance from channel, and hydraulic properties, resulting in zones of unique water level oscillation patterns. These zones impact ecology and geochemistry and correspond to differences in carbon accumulation rates. These physical-biogeochemical linkages enable use of a hydrological model to predict changes in marsh zonation, and in turn carbon accumulation, as well as groundwater-surface water exchange under SLR. Here, we developed a calibrated hydrological model of a Delaware coastal marsh using HydroGeoSphere. We simulated three scenarios each of SLR, sediment accretion, and upland hydrologic response, and we quantified changes in the spatial coverage of different hydrologic zonations and groundwater-surface water exchange. Results show that relative SLR reduces marsh area, carbon burial, and lateral water fluxes. However, the magnitudes of change are linked to the terrestrial groundwater table response as well as relative SLR. In scenarios where the upland water table does not change with SLR, the magnitude of decline in marsh area and carbon accumulation is reduced compared to scenarios where the upland water table keeps pace with SLR. In contrast, the reduction in lateral water flux is minimized in scenarios with an upland water table rise equal to SLR compared to scenarios where the upland water table is held at present-day levels. This study highlights the importance of regional hydrologic setting in the fate of coastal marsh dynamics. Plain Language Summary Coastal marshes are efficient carbon sinks, but their location at the land-sea interface makes them vulnerable to sea level rise. Through a web of complex interactions, coastal marsh hydrology, which is spatially variable, impacts carbon burial. This link between ecosystem processes enables the use of a physical, hydrological model to forecast changes in hydrology under variable relative sea level rise scenarios that can be related to alterations in carbon accumulation across the marsh. Our results show that both sea level and the water table on land impact coastal marsh hydrology. Results show a decrease in marsh area and carbon sequestration capacity with sea level rise, and variations in relative sea level rise and groundwater table response to climate change impact the magnitude of these effects.

TI  - Field Observation of Lateral Detritus Carbon Flux in a Coastal Wetland
AB  - The lateral transport of carbon has been increasingly recognized as an important component of carbon budget in wetlands. We studied a typical coastal salt marsh located at the estuary of the Yangtze River by measuring lateral transfer of macro-detritus carbon within a creek during each month's largest spring tide period, and simultaneously, we measured the gross primary production (GPP) by the eddy covariance (EC) method. The results showed a bimodal seasonal pattern of net detritus carbon export, with one peak associated with mainly green/fresh carbon materials and the other peak associated with mainly yellow-dark/senescent carbon materials. We also found that the export of green detritus carbon was highly correlated with plant phenology and the height of tides, suggesting influences from both the standing stock of living biomass and the force of tides. GPP measured by the EC technique (GPP(EC)) and by remote sensing (GPP(RS)) differed substantially. We found this difference was correlated well with the net export of green macro-detritus. In general, we concluded that the lateral flux is an important component of the carbon budget in the marsh and that to cross validate between GPP(EC) and GPP(RS), it must be included as a calibration term for computing GPP(EC).

TI  - Reconciling opposing views on carbon cycling in the coastal ocean: Continental shelves as sinks and near-shore ecosystems as sources of atmospheric CO2
AB  - Despite their moderately sized surface area, continental marginal seas play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, as they receive huge amounts of upwelled and riverine inputs of carbon and nutrients, sustaining a disproportionate large biological activity compared to their relative surface area. A synthesis of worldwide measurements of the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) indicates that most open shelves in the temperate and high-latitude regions are under-saturated with respect to atmospheric CO2 during all seasons, although the low-latitude shelves seem to be over-saturated. Most inner estuaries and near-shore coastal areas on the other hand are over-saturated with respect to atmospheric CO2. The scaling of air-sea CO2 fluxes based on pCO2 measurements and carbon mass-balance calculations indicate that the continental shelves absorb atmospheric CO2 ranging between 0.33 and 0.36 Pg C yr-1 that corresponds to an additional sink of 27% to âˆ¼30% of the CO2 uptake by the open oceans based on the most recent pCO2 climatology [Takahashi, T., Sutherland, S.C., Wanninkhof, R., Sweeney, C., Feely, R.A., Chipman, D., Hales, B., Friederich, G., Chavez, F., Watson, A., Bakker, D., Schuster, U., Metzl, N., Inoue, H.Y., Ishii, M., Midorikawa, T., Sabine, C., Hoppema, M., Olafsson, J., Amarson, T., Tilbrook, B., Johannessen, T., Olsen, A., Bellerby, R., De Baar, H., Nojiri, Y., Wong, C.S., Delille, B., Bates, N., 2009.

Inner estuaries, salt marshes and mangroves emit up to 0.50 Pg C yr-1, although these estimates are prone to large uncertainty due to poorly constrained ecosystem surface area estimates. Nevertheless, the view of continental shelves as sinks and near-shore ecosystems as sources of atmospheric CO2 allows reconciling long-lived opposing views on carbon cycling in the coastal ocean.

TI  - The present state-of-the-art of blue carbon repository in India: a meta-analysis
AB  - The present study collated data on the Indian blue carbon repository (mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes) from peer-reviewed literature on carbon stock assessment. This meta-analysis indicated that the blue carbon ecosystems of India could have a collective carbon stock of 67.35 Tg C (mangroves, seagrass, and salt marsh accounting for 67 Tg C, 0.0630 Tg C, and 0.0049 Tg C, respectively). Several studies have ubiquitously measured the spatial extent of mangroves (~ 4991 km2) and seagrasses (~ 517 km2) in India; however, the salt marshes (290â€“1398 km2) have contradictions in estimates. The green payments against the blue carbon ecosystems of India can be as high as ~ 9.6 billion US $, whereas the social cost of carbon sequestered by these ecosystems can vary between 0.47 and 5.43 billion US $. The present study also identified the key research areas that require priority to minimize the uncertainties in blue carbon stock assessment to foster a robust ecosystem-based approach for climate change adaptation in the country. The study identified that less than half of the total mangrove habitats of India are yet to be sampled leaving a scope of substantial uncertainty in nationwide blue carbon estimates. The spatial extent of Indiaâ€™s salt marshes is another aspect that needs to be delineated with a higher confidence level.

AB  - Mangroves are special types of woody plants that grow exclusively in the intertidal zones of the tropics and the subtropics. With respect to environmental and ecological values, mangroves protect the shoreline from tides, winds, and storms and act as the first line of defense against extreme weather in coastal areas. Moreover, mangroves have a continuous carbon fixation capacity, which is much higher than those of peat swamp and coastal salt marsh. Mangroves are an important part of the earth carbon cycle system and considered an important blue carbon sink on the sea and land margin. However, mangrove habitat is threatened all over the world due to human development and utilization activities. Therefore, monitoring the spatial distribution of mangrove types and biomass will help guide policy-makers in taking effective utilization and protection measures. In this paper, on the basis of UAV multispectral images and LiDAR point cloud data, the support vector machine classification method is used for mangrove identification. Furthermore, mangrove species are distinguished according to different heights and distribution areas using the elevation information in the UAV LiDAR point cloud data. The structure characteristics of mangrove single wood are extracted by the point-cloud-based cluster segmentation method, and an estimation model of the tree height, canopy, and aboveground biomass obtained by LiDAR remote sensing is constructed, Finally, the aboveground biomass of mangrove in the study area is calculated, and its spatial distribution information is analyzed. The classification result of the species types of mangroves, which is combined with the multi spectrum and LiDAR point cloud data, can reach 90.69% in total accuracy. The kappa coefficient is 0.88. The accuracies of the algorithm in identifying single trees of Kandelia candel and Aegiceras corniculata are 86.71% and 60.21%, respectively. Among them, the middle errors of the heights of K. candel and A. corniculata are 0.36 and 0.18 m, respectively, and the crown width extraction precision of K. candel is higher than that of A. corniculata. The regression models of the aboveground biomass of K. candel and A. corniculata are constructed. The accuracy of the fusion model is the highest, and the respective decision coefficients (RÂ²) are 0.678 and 0.832 for K. candel and A. corniculata. Mangroves are mostly planted artificially in the study area and distributed in a belt perpendicular to the dam: K. candelâ€”Cyperus malaccensis Lam. and Acanthus ilicifolius L. â€”A. corniculata. The area of A. corniculata is the largest, which is approximately 8.91 hm2 and distributed on both sides of the tidal ditch far from the dam. The area of K. candel is 4.69 hm2, which is distributed in the area near the dam. C. malaccensis Lam. and A. ilicifolius L. are scattered in small areas among the different types of objects. The aboveground biomass of mangrove is calculated by the estimation model of above ground biomass. The aboveground biomass follows the order Sonneratia apetala &gt; A. corniculata &gt; C. malaccensis Lam. &gt; K. candel &gt; A. ilicifolius L.

TI  - Variability and Vulnerability of Coastal `Blue Carbon' Stocks: A Case Study from Southeast Australia
AB  - `Blue carbon' ecosystems-seagrasses, tidal marshes, and mangroves-serve as dense carbon sinks important for reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, yet only recently have stock estimates emerged. We sampled 96 blue carbon ecosystems across the Victorian coastline (southeast Australia) to quantify total sediment stocks, variability across spatial scales, and estimate emissions associated with historical ecosystem loss. Mean sediment organic carbon (C-org) stock (+/- SE) to a depth of 30 cm was not significantly different between tidal marshes (87.1 +/- 4.90 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and mangroves (65.6 +/- 4.17 Mg C-org ha(-1)), but was significantly lower in seagrasses (24.3 +/- 1.82 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Location (defined as an individual meadow, marsh, or forest) had a stronger relationship with C-org stock than catchment region, suggesting local-scale conditions drive variability of stocks more than regional-scale processes. We estimate over 2.90 million +/- 199,000 Mg C-org in the top 30 cm of blue carbon sediments in Victoria (53\% in tidal marshes, 36\% in seagrasses, and 11\% in mangroves) and sequestration rates of 22,700 +/- 5510 Mg C-org year(-1) (valued at over \$AUD1 million +/- 245,000 year(-1) based on the average price of \$AUD12.14 Mg CO2 eq(-1) at Australian Emissions Reduction Fund auctions). We estimate ecosystem loss since European settlement may equate to emissions as high as 4.83 million +/- 358,000 Mg CO2 equivalents (assuming 90\% remineralization of stocks), 98\% of which was associated with tidal marsh loss, and what would have been sequestering 9360 +/- 2500 Mg C-org year(-1). This study is among the first to present a comprehensive comparison of sediment stocks across and within coastal blue carbon ecosystems. We estimate substantial and valuable carbon stocks associated with these ecosystems that have suffered considerable losses in the past and need protection into the future to maintain their role as carbon sinks.

TI  - Spatio-temporal characteristics and main influencing factors of vegetation net primary productivity in the Yellow River Delta in recent 30 years
AB  - Salt marsh vegetation, mangrove, and sea grass in coastal areas are highly efficient carbon sinks; the carbon sequestrated by these is described as coastal blue carbon and their ecosystems are described as coastal blue carbon ecosystems. The coastline of China is long and the coastal blue carbon ecosystems are widely distributed. With rapid development of economy and consistent increase in CO2 emission, exploring the potential of coastal blue carbon has become an important way to increase the carbon sink and decrease the pressure of CO2 emission. It is of great significance to identify the temporal and spatial characteristics of net primary productivity (NPP) in coastal blue carbon ecosystems under various and complex anthropogenic disturbances. The study was conducted in the Yellow River Delta, and the recent 30 years (1987, 1995, 2005 and 2016-2017) was used as the time scale for analysis. The spatio-temporal characteristics and main influencing factors were analyzed using data from remote sensing and field investigations. The results indicated that: The mean value and total amount of NPP decreased first and then increased slightly during the recent 30 years, and the mean values of NPP in the summer of 1987, 1995, 2005, and 2016 were 94.93, 63.90, 64.56, and 69.54g Cm-2 month"1, respectively. The mean value and total amount of NPP in the year 2016-2017 were 294.38g Cm-2 a-1 and 710.05GgC/a which showed distinct seasonal differences. Obvious spatial heterogeneity existed in different districts, nature reserves, and land cover types. Comparing the different districts, Lijin County possessed larger temporal fluctuation of NPP than the other two districts. The mean value of NPP inside natural reserves was higher than that outside the natural reserves, which was higher in the experimental zone of the nature reserve than in the buffer and core zones. Further, the mean values of NPP were similar in old and new estuaries in the year 2016-2017. Among the different land cover types, wetland vegetation possessed the highest mean value and total amount of NPP, followed by farmland. The NPP values in other land cover types were low. The results from NPP partitioning for the year 2016-2017 showed that the proportion of area with medium NPP was the most (49.5%), followed by low NPP (38.3%), and high NPP (12.1%). The spatio-temporal characteristics of NPP were determined by land cover types and vegetation growth conditions. The land-sea interaction, exploitation activities, and ecological establishment in recent years were the main influencing factors of the spatio-temporal variations in NPP in the study area. Wetland vegetation and farmland were the main contributors of carbon sink and their mean values of NPP increased steadily since the 1990s, and reached 570.28g Cm-2 a-1 and 335.92g Cm-2 a-1 in the year 2016-2017. In the 30 years, the total amount of NPP continuously decreased in wetland vegetation and increased in farmland. Wetland vegetation is the typical carrier of coastal blue carbon. Meanwhile, farmland, which is located in coastal areas, transformed from wetland vegetation, and possesses high ability and potential for carbon sequestration, can be considered as an important supplement for coastal blue carbon.

TI  - Sea Level-Driven Marsh Migration Results in Rapid Net Loss of Carbon
AB  - Sea level rise alters coastal carbon cycling by driving the rapid migration of coastal ecosystems, salinization of freshwater systems, and replacement of terrestrial forests with tidal wetlands. Wetland soils accumulate carbon (C) at faster rates than terrestrial soils, implying that sea level rise may lead to enhanced carbon accumulation. Here, we show that carbon stored in tree biomass greatly exceeds carbon stored in adjacent marsh soils so that marsh migration reduces total carbon stocks by similar to 50\% in less than 100 years. Continued marsh soil carbon accumulation may eventually offset forest carbon loss, but we estimate that the time for replacement is similar to estimates of marsh survival (i.e., centuries), which suggests that forest C may never be replaced. These findings reveal a critical C source not included in coastal C budgets driven by migrating ecosystems and rapidly shifting allocations between carbon stored in soils and biomass.

TI  - Comparing carbon accumulation in restored and natural wetland soils of coastal Louisiana
AB  - Louisiana's chronic wetland deterioration has resulted in massive soil organic matter loss and subsequent carbon release through oxidation. To combat these losses, and reestablish ecosystem function, goods, and services, many restoration projects have been constructed or planned throughout coastal Louisiana. There are significant data gaps and conflicting results regarding wetland contributions to global warming, especially related to carbon sequestration in restored wetlands. An exceptionally large data set was used to derive carbon accumulation rates from key soil characteristics and processes. Assessments and comparisons of bulk density, organic matter, total carbon, vertical accretion (short- and longer-term), and carbon accumulation rates were made across time (chronosequence) and space (i.e., coastwide, watershed basins, and vegetation zones). Carbon accumulation rates in the Louisiana coastal zone were generally correlated to hydrogeomorphology, with higher rates occurring in zones of high river connectivity or in swamp or higher salinity tolerant marsh. On average, naturally occurring wetlands had higher carbon accumulation rates than restoration sites. Although some restoration measures were higher, and most showed increasing carbon accumulation rates over time. Results demonstrate that although wetland restoration provides many ecosystem benefits, the associated carbon sequestration may also provide useful measures for climate change management.

TI  - Primary producers sustaining macro-invertebrate communities in intertidal mangrove forests
AB  - In contrast to the large number of studies on the trophic significance of mangrove primary production to the aquatic foodweb, there have been few attempts to provide an overview of the relative importance of different primary carbon sources to invertebrates in the intertidal mangrove habitats. We determined carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta(13)C, delta(15)N) in sediments, primary producers, and invertebrate species from an intertidal mangrove forest located along the southeast coast of India in order to determine the contribution of mangrove leaf litter and other carbon sources to the invertebrate community. Organic matter in sediments under the mangrove vegetation was characterized by relatively high delta(13)C values and low C:N ratios, indicating that mangrove-derived organic matter was not the principal source and that imported phytodetritus from the mangrove creeks and adjacent bay significantly contributed to the sediment organic matter pool. Invertebrates were found to display a wide range of delta(13)C values, most being 3-11parts per thousand enriched relative to the average mangrove leaf signal. The pulmonate gastropod Onchidium sp. showed unusually low delta(15)N values (-5.6+/-0.9parts per thousand), but further work is needed to adequately explain these data. A compilation of stable isotope data from various sources indicates that significant assimilation of mangrove-derived carbon is only detectable in a limited number of species, and suggests that local and imported algal sources are a major source of carbon for benthic invertebrate communities in intertidal mangrove forests. These results provide new insights into carbon utilization patterns in vegetated tropical intertidal habitats and show a striking similarity with results from temperate salt marsh ecosystems where local plant production has often been found to contribute little to intertidal foodwebs.

TI  - A blue carbon ecosystems qualitative assessment applying the DPSIR framework: Local perspective of global benefits and contributions
AB  - Mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes or collectively known as blue carbon ecosystems are gaining salience because of their essential roles in reducing the risks and impacts of climate change through carbon sequestration and other beneficial services. Despite this, they are globally declining because of their vulnerability to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Similar trends are also observed in Busuanga Island, Palawan province in the Philippines, where blue carbon ecosystems along with other coastal environments are perceived to be threatened by a number of factors. To better understand the state changes of blue carbon ecosystems, we collected the drivers and pressures and their impact on the whole coastal ecosystem as well as existing management responses by interviewing 26 stakeholders representing community organizations, non-government organizations, and municipal level government units from two municipalities (Busuanga and Coron) in the island. We used the Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework to analyze the information gathered from the interviews. The results of this study show that lack of institutional capacities (indirect driver) is the leading factor that hinders the progress or efficacy of the management. Most pronounced pressures caused by direct drivers to blue carbon ecosystems include overexploitation and coastal developments. The responses collected in the interviews can be grouped into policies and implementation, capacity building development, welfare and livelihood development, ecosystems management, and tourism measures. The information gathered in this study can be used to improve or change existing responses into more precise and contextualized measures in addressing specific impacts observed in the local areas.

TI  - Where temperate meets tropical: multi-factorial effects of elevated CO2, nitrogen enrichment, and competition on a mangrove-salt marsh community
AB  - Our understanding of how elevated CO2 and interactions with other factors will affect coastal plant communities is limited. Such information is particularly needed for transitional communities where major vegetation types converge. Tropical mangroves (Avicennia germinans) intergrade with temperate salt marshes (Spartina alterniflora) in the northern Gulf of Mexico, and this transitional community represents an important experimental system to test hypotheses about global change impacts on critical ecosystems. We examined the responses of A. germinans (C-3) and S. alterniflora (C-4), grown in monoculture and mixture in mesocosms for 18 months, to interactive effects of atmospheric CO2 and pore water nitrogen (N) concentrations typical of these marshes. A. germinans, grown without competition from S. alterniflora, increased final biomass (35\%) under elevated CO2 treatment and higher N availability. Growth of A. germinans was severely curtailed, however, when grown in mixture with S. alterniflora, and enrichment with CO2 and N could not reverse this growth suppression. A field experiment using mangrove seedlings produced by CO2- and N-enriched trees confirmed that competition from S. alterniflora suppressed growth under natural conditions and further showed that herbivory greatly reduced survival of all seedlings. Thus, mangroves will not supplant marsh vegetation due to elevated CO2 alone, but instead will require changes in climate, environmental stress, or disturbance to alter the competitive balance between these species. However, where competition and herbivory are low, elevated CO2 may accelerate mangrove transition from the seedling to sapling stage and also increase above- and belowground production of existing mangrove stands, particularly in combination with higher soil N.

TI  - Carbon outwelling and outgassing vs. burial in an estuarine tidal creek surrounded by mangrove and saltmarsh wetlands
AB  - Mangrove- and saltmarsh-dominated estuaries have high rates of organic carbon burial. Here, we estimate soil, pore water, and surface-water carbon fluxes in an Australian estuarine tidal creek to assess whether (1) advective pore water exchange releases some of the soil carbon, (2) outwelling (lateral exports) represents a major carbon sequestration mechanism, and (3) methane emissions offset soil carbon sequestration. A radon (222Rn) mass balance implied tidally driven pore-water exchange rates ranging from 5.5 Â± 3.6 to 15.6 Â± 8.1 cm dâˆ’1. Pore water exchange explained most of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and methane surface-water fluxes but not dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and alkalinity. Organic carbon burial in soils derived from 239 + 240Pu dating was 11â€“63 g C mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1. Methane and carbon dioxide emissions at the waterâ€“air interface were 0.27 Â± 0.03 and 63 Â± 166 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1, respectively. When calculated as CO2-equivalents, aquatic CH4 emissions converted to 19â€“94 g C-CO2 mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1. Upscaling methane and soil carbon fluxes to representative areas revealed that CH4 emissions could offset &lt; 5% of soil carbon burial. DIC outwelling (12 Â± 6 mmol mâˆ’2 catchment dâˆ’1) was less than five-fold greater than DOC and particulate organic carbon (POC) outwelling and four-fold greater than catchment-wide carbon burial. Because much of this DIC remains in the ocean after airâ€“water equilibration, lateral DIC exports may represent an important long-term carbon sink. Recent research has focused on quantifying carbon burial rates in blue carbon habitats such as saltmarshes and mangroves. We suggest that DIC outwelling and methane outgassing should also be considered when assessing the carbon sequestration capacity of these coastal vegetated habitats.

TI  - Controls on soil organic carbon stocks in tidal marshes along an estuarine salinity gradient
AB  - Tidal marshes are sedimentary environments and are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth. As a consequence they have the potential to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations by sequestering organic carbon (OC). In the past decades, most research on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in marsh environments has focused on salt marshes, leaving carbon dynamics in brackish and freshwater marshes largely understudied and neglecting the diversity among tidal marshes. We therefore conducted an extensive sampling campaign to quantify and characterize SOC stock in marshes along a salinity gradient in the Scheldt estuary (Belgium and the Netherlands). We find that SOC stocks vary significantly along the estuary, from 46 in freshwater marshes to 10 kg OC m(-2) in salt marshes. Our data also show that most existing studies underestimate total SOC stocks due to shallow soil sampling, which also influences reported patterns in OC storage along estuaries. In all sampled tidal marsh sediments the SOC concentration is more or less constant from a certain depth downward. However, this concentration decreases with increasing salinity, indicating that the amount of stable SOC decreases from the upper estuary towards the coast. Although the net primary production of macrophytes differs along the estuary, our data suggest that the differences in OC storage are caused mainly by variations in suspended sediment concentration and stable particulate OC (POC) content in the water along the estuary. The fraction of terrestrial suspended sediments and POC that is transported downstream of the maximum turbidity zone is very limited, contributing to smaller amounts of long-term OC sequestration in brackish and salt marsh sediments. In addition, high rates of sediment deposition on freshwater tidal marshes in the maximum turbidity zone promote efficient burial of OC in these marsh sediments.

TI  - Salinity influence on methane emissions from tidal marshes
AB  - The relationship between methane emissions and salinity is not well understood in tidal marshes, leading to uncertainty about the net effect of marsh conservation and restoration on greenhouse gas balance.We used published and unpublished field data to investigate the relationships between tidal marsh methane emissions, salinity, and porewater concentrations of methane and sulfate, then used these relationships to consider the balance between methane emissions and soil carbon sequestration. Polyhaline tidal marshes (salinity >18) had significantly lower methane emissions (mean Â± sd=1Â±2 gm-2 yr-1) than other marshes, and can be expected to decrease radiative forcing when created or restored. There was no significant difference in methane emissions from fresh (salinity=0-0.5) and mesohaline (5-18) marshes (42Â±76 and 16Â±11 gm-2 yr-1, respectively), while oligohaline (0.5-5) marshes had the highest and most variable methane emissions (150Â±221 gm-2 yr-1). Annual methane emissions were modeled using a linear fit of salinity against log-transformed methane flux ( logCH4 = 0:056 salinity 1:38; r 2 = 0. 5 2 ; p < 0.0001). Managers interested in using marshes as greenhouse gas sinks can assume negligible methane emissions in polyhaline systems, but need to estimate or monitor methane emissions in lower-salinity marshes.

TI  - Carbon Stocks in Vegetation and Soil and Their Relationship with Plant Community Traits in a Mediterranean Non-tidal Salt Marsh
AB  - Salt marshes are considered among the ecosystems with the highest capacity for carbon sequestration. However, studies have mainly focused on tidal salt marshes, while knowledge about non-tidal salt marshes, which prevail in the Mediterranean Basin, is currently scarce. Consequently, we aimed to (1) estimate the carbon stocks of the vegetation, litter, and soil of three natural Habitats of Community Interest of a Mediterranean non-tidal salt marshâ€“a halophilous scrub, a salt meadow, and a glasswort swardâ€“and (2) determine how differences in floristic composition and community structure among habitats over 1 year are related to the amount and distribution of carbon stored in plants and soils. Results show that the halophilous scrub and the salt meadow were constituted by mature plant communities with overall stable carbon stocks in the vegetation, litter, and soil (0â€“20 cm), which were approximately 4 and 2.5 times larger, respectively, than those found in the glasswort sward (1013 Â± 40 g C mâˆ’2). However, while the salt meadow and the glasswort sward had more carbon stored in the soil than in the vegetation (approximately 3 and 7.5 times more, respectively), the halophilous scrub had similar amounts in both compartments (2248 Â± 388 and 1566 Â± 179 g C mâˆ’2 in the soil and vegetation, respectively). Sarcocornia fruticosa represented 93.5% of the total plant biomass of the halophilous scrub, which highlights the importance of this species in maintaining carbon stocks in this Mediterranean non-tidal salt marsh.

TI  - Carbon fluxes and stocks in a carbonate-rich chenier plain
AB  - Coastal wetlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle because they have high ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration capability. Previous research focused on the carbon dynamics of organic-rich ecosystems (e.g., salt marshes, mangroves), while little attention has paid to the carbon cycling of carbonate-rich ecosystems such as chenier plains, sandy or shelly beach ridges that are parts of strand plains. Here we examined the carbon stocks and fluxes of the poorly studied chenier plain in the Yellow River Delta, China. The inorganic and organic carbon pools in the top 1 m sediment were 444 +/- 92 Mg C ha(-1) and 89 +/- 7 Mg C ha(-1), respectively. The average CO2 net sequestration was -177 +/- 51 Mg C ha(-1), indicating that the chenier plain had a net CO2 evasion during the entire soil formation process. With plant growth, however, the chenier plain provided a significant carbon sink (395 g C m(-2) a(-1)) on a per-unit area basis. The annual gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (Re) were 1067 and 672 g C m(-2) a(-1), respectively. The carbon sink strength of the chenier plain was comparable to that of organic-rich salt marshes on a per-unit area basis. The biomass carbon pool was 5.0 +/- 1.4 Mg C ha(-1) in the chenier plain. Moreover, the sediment inorganic carbon content in mudflats was significantly lower than that of vegetated habitats. Our results showed that plant grown in a chenier plain could significantly enhance carbon sequestration by increasing organic carbon storage. Inorganic carbon storage should be considered in blue carbon inventories because inorganic carbon dominates the carbon pool and is important in the carbon cycling in a chenier plain. Our findings can help us better understand the carbon cycling of carbonate-rich coastal ecosystems and can inform chenier plain conservation and restoration efforts.

TI  - Blue carbon fluxes and inventories in mangroves associated with an anthropized coastal lagoon [Flujos e inventarios de carbono azul en manglares asociados a una laguna costera antropizada]
AB  - Mangroves, along with seagrasses and saltmarshes, are among the coastal ecosystems known as blue carbon ecosystems. These ecosystems are natural carbon sinks, relevant to mitigate global warming because they are able to sequester significant amounts of CO2 for biomass production, and to store organic matter in sediments for a very long time. We present the temporal evaluation of fluxes (g mâˆ’2 yearâˆ’1) and inventories (Mg haâˆ’1) of organic carbon (Corg) from sediment cores collected in mangroves areas associated with the coastal lagoon Estero de UrÃ­as, in MazatlÃ¡n, Sinaloa. The work strategy included the geochemical characterization of sediments by elemental composition analysis through X-ray fluorescence spectrometry to evaluate changes in sediment origin (terrestrial or marine); the determination of the grain size distribution to evaluate changes in the hydrodynamics of the study sites; and the quantification of Corg concentrations with an elemental analyzer. Finally, we estimated the economic cost of the impacts of CO2 emissions caused by the oxidation of Corg due to potential perturbations of the study sites. This information is an additional component of the economic benefits of the preservation of mangrove ecosystems, relevant in coastal wetland management plans, since mangrove conservation contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and could be used as part of an ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change strategy in tropical and subtropical zones around the world.

TI  - Indirect Human Impacts Reverse Centuries of Carbon Sequestration and Salt Marsh Accretion
AB  - Direct and indirect human impacts on coastal ecosystems have increased over the last several centuries, leading to unprecedented degradation of coastal habitats and loss of ecological services. Here we document a two-century temporal disparity between salt marsh accretion and subsequent loss to indirect human impacts. Field surveys, manipulative experiments and GIS analyses reveal that crab burrowing weakens the marsh peat base and facilitates further burrowing, leading to bank calving, disruption of marsh accretion, and a loss of over two centuries of sequestered carbon from the marsh edge in only three decades. Analogous temporal disparities exist in other systems and are a largely unrecognized obstacle in attaining sustainable ecosystem services in an increasingly human impacted world. In light of the growing threat of indirect impacts worldwide and despite uncertainties in the fate of lost carbon, we suggest that estimates of carbon emissions based only on direct human impacts may significantly underestimate total anthropogenic carbon emissions.

TI  - Drivers and modelling of blue carbon stock variability in sediments of southeastern Australia
AB  - Tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows are important global carbon (C) sinks, commonly referred to as coastal ``blue carbon{''}. However, these ecosystems are rapidly declining with little understanding of what drives the magnitude and variability of C associated with them, making strategic and effective management of blue C stocks challenging. In this study, our aims were threefold: (1) identify ecological, geomorphological, and anthropogenic variables associated with 30 cm deep sediment C stock variability in blue C ecosystems in southeastern Australia, (2) create a predictive model of 30 cm deep sediment blue C stocks in southeastern Australia, and (3) map regional 30 cm deep sediment blue C stock magnitude and variability. We had the unique opportunity to use a high-spatial-density C stock dataset of sediments to 30 cm deep from 96 blue C ecosystems across the state of Victoria, Australia, integrated with spatially explicit environmental data to reach these aims. We used an information theoretic approach to create, average, validate, and select the best averaged general linear mixed effects model for predicting C stocks across the state. Ecological drivers (i.e. ecosystem type or ecological vegetation class) best explained variability in C stocks, relative to geomorphological and anthropogenic drivers. Of the geomorphological variables, distance to coast, distance to freshwater, and slope best explained C stock variability. Anthropogenic variables were of least importance. Our model explained 46\% of the variability in 30 cm deep sediment C stocks, and we estimated over 2.31 million Mg C stored in the top 30 cm of sediments in coastal blue C ecosystems in Victoria, 88\% of which was contained within four major coastal areas due to the extent of blue C ecosystems (similar to 87\% of total blue C ecosystem area). Regionally, these data can inform conservation management, paired with assessment of other ecosystem services, by enabling identification of hotspots for protection and key locations for restoration efforts. We recommend these methods be tested for applicability to other regions of the globe for identifying drivers of sediment C stock variability and producing predictive C stock models at scales relevant for resource management.

TI  - Mechanisms of enhanced methane emission due to introduction of Spartina anglica and Phragmites australis in a temperate tidal salt marsh
AB  - Introductions of exotic plants are widespread ecological threats disturbing the carbon and nutrient cycles in global coastal wetlands. Previous studies have found that the invasion has enhanced methane emission through increased primary production and a changed methanogenic pathway. However, the previous studies did not determine the depth profiles of the changes while the depth in the soil profile to which the disturbance propagates is one of the critical issues to be addressed. In this study, we illustrated the depth profiles of the effect of the introductions of S. anglica and P. australis on the potential methane production, soil biogeochemistry, and soil microbial community which play a substantial role in enhanced methane emission due to the invasions. The in situ field measurements and anaerobic incubation were conducted to determine the mechanistic differences of depth profiles. Both introductions of S. anglica and P. australis increased methane emission through different microbial mechanisms depending on depth profile. Potential methane production was stimulated in shallow and deep soil layer of S. anglica and P. australis-introduced marshes, respectively. S. anglica increased the contribution of methylotrophic methanogenesis in top soil layers while P. australis decreased competitive inhibition by sulfate reducers in all soil layers. These results emphasize the importance of below-ground microbial activity and vertical distribution in carbon cycles in tidal marshes. Further plant invasion studies should focus on depth profiles of microbial processes, as their distribution and activity vary substantially across soil depths.

TI  - Carbon Stocks of Tropical Coastal Wetlands within the Karstic Landscape of the Mexican Caribbean
AB  - Coastal wetlands can have exceptionally large carbon (C) stocks and their protection and restoration would constitute an effective mitigation strategy to climate change. Inclusion of coastal ecosystems in mitigation strategies requires quantification of carbon stocks in order to calculate emissions or sequestration through time. In this study, we quantified the ecosystem C stocks of coastal wetlands of the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve (SKBR) in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. We stratified the SKBR into different vegetation types (tall, medium and dwarf mangroves, and marshes), and examined relationships of environmental variables with C stocks. At nine sites within SKBR, we quantified ecosystem C stocks through measurement of above and belowground biomass, downed wood, and soil C. Additionally, we measured nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from the soil and interstitial salinity. Tall mangroves had the highest C stocks (987 +/- 338 Mg ha(-1)) followed by medium mangroves (623 +/- 41 Mg ha(-1)), dwarf mangroves (381 +/- 52 Mg ha(-1)) and marshes (177 +/- 73 Mg ha(-1)). At all sites, soil C comprised the majority of the ecosystem C stocks (78-99\%). Highest C stocks were measured in soils that were relatively low in salinity, high in P and low in N: P, suggesting that P limits C sequestration and accumulation potential. In this karstic area, coastal wetlands, especially mangroves, are important C stocks. At the landscape scale, the coastal wetlands of Sian Ka'an covering approximate to 172,176 ha may store 43.2 to 58.0 million Mg of C.

TI  - Carbon storage in coastal wetlands is related to elevation and how it changes over time
AB  - National and global scale initiatives to reduce loss and promote restoration of coastal ecosystems have leveraged the capacity of mangrove and saltmarsh to contribute to climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration. The success of these programs is predicated on reliable estimates of carbon storage and how this changes over time. Efforts to describe spatial variation in below-ground carbon storage have largely focussed on surface sediments, with few studies able to characterise carbon at greater soil depths. This study demonstrates that landscape position occupied by wetland vegetation influences both carbon storage and sources, and that understanding evolutionary infill of estuaries is crucial for characterising spatial variation in carbon storage. We focussed on coastal wetlands in southeast Australia where sea level has a long history of relative stability over the past few millennia. Under these conditions, we show that carbon storage varies across three depth zones in substrate: the active root zone (associated with distribution of contemporary vegetation), inactive root zone (associated with past environmental conditions) and subtidal zone (beyond the contemporary intertidal zone). This conceptual approach relates spatial variation in carbon storage to key processes influencing carbon addition and decomposition, and can be applied elsewhere depending on the sea-level history at the specific site. We demonstrate that models that define carbon storage in the context of variation in landscape position of vegetation in the tidal frame provide improved confidence required for blue carbon assessments.

TI  - Large variability in organic carbon and CaCO3 burial in seagrass meadows: a case study from three Australian estuaries
AB  - Blue carbon refers to the carbon accumulation capacity of vegetated coastal habitats, including salt marshes, mangroves forests and seagrass meadows. Here we present estimates of organic carbon (C-org) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) burial rates from 4 seagrass species (Halophila ovalis, Posidonia australis, Ruppia megacarpa, Zostera muelleri) in 3 temperate estuaries on the east coast of Australia. The C-org burial rates (mean +/- SE) varied by an order of magnitude across the seagrass communities (16 +/- 3 to 130 +/- 40 g m(-2) yr(-1)). The delta C-13(org) and C-org:N ratios suggest that the seagrass communities buried variable mixtures of seagrass, algal and mangrove/terrestrial material. CaCO3 burial rates ranged from 15 +/- 11 to 188 +/- 122 g m(-2) yr(-1), which, if precipitated by calcifying organisms in these or nearby habitats, may offset up to 89\% of the C-org burial across the 8 seagrass communities. Our results highlight a large range in both C-org and CaCO3 burial rates, and the provenance of the carbon sequestered in seagrasses, factors that need to be considered when assessing the role of seagrasses in blue carbon and climate change mitigation strategies.
