TI  - Recent Carbon Storage and Burial Exceed Historic Rates in the San Juan Bay Estuary Peri-Urban Mangrove Forests (Puerto Rico, United States)
AB  - Mangroves sequester significant quantities of organic carbon (C) because of high rates of burial in the soil and storage in biomass. We estimated mangrove forest C storage and accumulation rates in aboveground and belowground components among five sites along an urbanization gradient in the San Juan Bay Estuary, Puerto Rico. Sites included the highly urbanized and clogged Cano Martin Pena in the western half of the estuary, a series of lagoons in the center of the estuary, and a tropical forest reserve (Pinones) in the easternmost part. Radiometrically dated cores were used to determine sediment accretion and soil C storage and burial rates. Measurements of tree dendrometers coupled with allometric equations were used to estimate aboveground biomass. Estuary-wide mangrove forest C storage and accumulation rates were estimated using interpolation methods and coastal vegetation cover data. In recent decades (1970-2016), the highly urbanized Martin Pena East (MPE) site with low flushing had the highest C storage and burial rates among sites. The MPE soil carbon burial rate was over twice as great as global estimates. Mangrove forest C burial rates in recent decades were significantly greater than historic decades (1930-1970) at Cano Martin Pena and Pinones. Although MPE and Pinones had similarly low flushing, the landscape settings (clogged canal vs forest reserve) and urbanization (high vs low) were different. Apparently, not only urbanization, but site-specific flushing patterns, landscape setting, and soil fertility affected soil C storage and burial rates. There was no difference in C burial rates between historic and recent decades at the San Jose and La Torrecilla lagoons. Mangrove forests had soil C burial rates ranging from 88 g m(-2) y(-1) at the San Jose lagoon to 469 g m(-2) y(-1) at the MPE in recent decades. Watershed anthropogenic CO2 emissions (1.56 million Mg C y(-1)) far exceeded the annual mangrove forest C storage rates (aboveground biomass plus soils: 17,713 Mg C y(-1)). A combination of maintaining healthy mangrove forests and reducing anthropogenic emissions might be necessary to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in urban, tropical areas.

TI  - Effect of heavy metal pollution on mangrove (Avicennia Marina) Carbon sequestration at Mithi River
AB  - Mithi river originates from streams and spillway discharges of Tulsi, Vihar and Powai Lakes. It travels from different kinds of residential and industrial areas and finally meets the Arabian sea at Mahim creek. This area is covered with various mangrove species and a fragile ecosystem, among that Avicennia marina is the dominant and covers a maximum area of the sites. This river is more polluted, but in spite of having intensive anthropogenic pressures Avicennia marina shows the greatest adaptation to extremely arid environments. But, it is surprising to learn that such a natural fighter against pollution is constantly being affected by the rising level of heavy metal pollution. To estimate heavy metals pollution impact on mangrove and its carbon sequestration, the study site sediment and mangrove samples were analysed. Sediment is a natural sinker of various heavy metals from different pollutions (Tam FNY and Wong YS 1999). Subsequently CHNS analyzer was used for the assessment of mangrove carbon sequestration. Finally Pearson correlation method were use to understand heavy metal pollution correlation with carbon sequestration capacity. Seasonal analysis report shows that, heavy metal concentrations were highest in post monsoon followed by monsoon and least in pre monsoon season. The other hand mangrove carbon sequestration results were found in reverse pattern. So study finding proves that Mithi river study site is highly affected by heavy metal pollution and it has shown significant correlation with carbon sequestration. As a result mangrove carbon sequestration is severely affected. Â© Copyright EM International.

TI  - Soil and Vegetative Carbon Sequestration in Khuran Estuary Mangroves, Strait of Hormoz, During the Last 18 Centuries
AB  - The present paper, for the first time, estimates the amount of soil and vegetative blue carbon (C) sequestered in Khuran mangrove, Iran's largest mangrove forest along the Persian Gulf coasts. Cores were retrieved down to parental materials in 32 stations to achieve whole-soil C stock. A radiocarbon dating was also used to estimate sediment accretion and C sequestration rates during the last 18 centuries. Results indicated that soils and mangrove trees of the Khuran store a total of 16.79 Tg C (equivalent to similar to 60 Tg of CO2), 98.8\% of which (16.59 Tg C) is sequestered in mangrove soils. During the last couple of thousand years, 8967 Mg C year(-1) (one Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) has been stored in mangrove soils of the area. Mean whole-soil C stock in Khamir and Qeshm is 1076 and 2134 Mg C ha(-1), respectively. A total of 5181 Gg C and 201 Gg C is stored in the top 1 m of soil and mangrove trees, respectively, 76\% of which is sequestered in QM. Our results also indicate that mangroves located in desert and dryland coasts can store comparable quantities of belowground C than their tropical counterparts. High phytoplankton concentration and accreting mangrove high organic C content soils on their own accumulated peat in response to sea-level rise have possibly caused Khuran desert mangroves to store large amounts of C in their sediments. Our estimates suggest that probable complete deforestation of Khuran mangrove could lead to 8.14 Tg CO2 equivalent emissions.

TI  - Assessing Mangrove Above-Ground Biomass and Structure using Terrestrial Laser Scanning: A Case Study in the Everglades National Park
AB  - Mangroves are among the ecosystems with the highest potential for carbon sequestration and storage. In these ecosystems and others above-ground biomass (AGB) is often used to estimate above-ground carbon content. We used a Leica-ScanStation-C10 Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) to estimate the volume and AGB of 40 mangrove trees distributed in three different mangrove sites located along Shark River Slough (SRS), in the western Everglades National Park. To estimate the volumetric shape of mangroves, we modeled stems as tapered geometrical surfaces called frustums of paraboloids and prop roots (Rhizophora mangle) as toroids and cylinders. AGB was estimated by multiplying the TLS-derived volume by wood specific density. Our TLS method for the SRS sites resulted in AGB estimates in the range of: 3.9 +/- 0.4 to 31.3 +/- 3.4 kg per tree in the short mangrove (< 5 m) site, 27.4 +/- 3.0 to 119.1 +/- 12.9 kg per tree in the intermediate (< 13 m) site and 52.1 +/- 6.7 to 1756.5 +/- 189.7 kg per tree in the tall (13-23 m) mangrove site. Our quantitative results: (1) enabled us to develop site-specific allometric relationships for tree diameter and AGB and (2) suggested that TLS is a promising alternative to destructive sampling.

TI  - Coastal aquaculture, mangrove deforestation and blue carbon emissions: Is REDD plus a solution?
AB  - Globally, coastal aquaculture particularly shrimp farming has been under huge criticism because of its environmental impacts including devastating effects on mangrove forests. However, mangroves are ecologically and economically important forests, and the most carbon-rich forests in the tropics that provide a wide range of ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. Carbon emissions are likely to have been the dominant cause of climate change and blue carbon emissions are being critically augmented through mangrove deforestation. Because of mangrove deforestation, different climatic variables including coastal flooding, cyclone, drought, rainfall, salinity, sea-level rise, and sea surface temperature have dramatic effects on coastal aquaculture. Mangrove forests have been instrumental in augmenting resilience to climate change. The ``Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD){''} program can help to restore mangroves which in turn increases options for adaptation{''} to climate change. However, technical and financial assistance with institutional support are needed to implement REDD+. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Changes in soil characteristics and C dynamics after mangrove clearing (Vietnam)
AB  - Of the blue carbon sinks, mangroves have one of the highest organic matter (OM) storage capacities in their soil due to low mineralization processes resulting from waterlogging. However, mangroves are disappearing worldwide because of demographic increases. In addition to the loss of CO2 fixation, mangrove clearing can strongly affect soil characteristics and C storage. The objectives of the present study were to quantify the evolution of soil quality, carbon stocks and carbon fluxes after mangrove clearing. Sediment cores to assess physico-chemical properties were collected and in situ CO2 fluxes were measured at the soil-air interface in a mangrove of Northern Vietnam. We compared a Kandelia candel mangrove forest with a nearby zone that had been cleared two years before the study. Significant decrease of clay content and an increase in bulk density for the upper 35Â cm in the cleared zone were observed. Soil organic carbon (OC) content in the upper 35Â cm decreased by &gt;Â 65% two years after clearing. The quantity and the quality of the carbon changed, with lower carbon to nitrogen ratios, indicating a more decomposed OM, a higher content of dissolved organic carbon, and a higher content of inorganic carbon (three times higher). This highlights the efficiency of mineralization processes following clearing. Due to the rapid decrease in the soil carbon content, CO2 fluxes at sediment interface were &gt;Â 50% lower in the cleared zone. Taking into account carbonate precipitation after OC mineralization, the mangrove soil lost ~Â 10Â MgOCÂ haâˆ’Â 1Â yrâˆ’Â 1 mostly as CO2 to the atmosphere and possibly as dissolved forms towards adjacent ecosystems. The impacts on the carbon cycle of mangrove clearing as shown by the switch from a C sink to a C source highlight the importance of maintaining these ecosystems, particularly in a context of climate change.

TI  - Fingerprinting Blue Carbon: Rationale and Tools to Determine the Source of Organic Carbon in Marine Depositional Environments
AB  - Blue carbon is the organic carbon in oceanic and coastal ecosystems that is captured on centennial to millennial timescales. Maintaining and increasing blue carbon is an integral component of strategies to mitigate global warming. Marine vegetated ecosystems (especially seagrass meadows, mangrove forests, and tidal marshes) are blue carbon hotspots and their degradation and loss worldwide have reduced organic carbon stocks and increased CO2 emissions. Carbon markets, and conservation and restoration schemes aimed at enhancing blue carbon sequestration and avoiding greenhouse gas emissions, will be aided by knowing the provenance and fate of blue carbon. We review and critique current methods and the potential of nascent methods to track the provenance and fate of organic carbon, including: bulk isotopes, compound-specific isotopes, biomarkers, molecular properties, and environmental DNA (eDNA). We find that most studies to date have used bulk isotopes to determine provenance, but this approach often cannot distinguish the contribution of different primary producers to organic carbon in depositional marine environments. Based on our assessment, we recommend application of multiple complementary methods. In particular, the use of carbon and nitrogen isotopes of lipids along with eDNA have a great potential to identify the source and quantify the contribution of different primary producers to sedimentary organic carbon in marine ecosystems. Despite the promising potential of these new techniques, further research is needed to validate them. This critical overview can inform future research to help underpin methodologies for the implementation of blue carbon focused climate change mitigation schemes.

TI  - Deciphering organic matter sources and ecological shifts in blue carbon ecosystems based on molecular fingerprinting
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (BCE) play an essential role in the global carbon cycle by removing atmospheric carbon dioxide and storing it as organic carbon (OC) in biomass and sediments. However, organic matter (OM) deposition and degradation/preservation processes are poorly understood, especially on the long-term and at molecular scales. We analysed sediment samples from six cores collected in tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrasses (up to 150 cm long cores spanning up to 10,000 yrs of OC accumulation) from Spencer Gulf (South Australia), by pyrolysis (Py-GCâ€“MS and THM-GCâ€“MS), and we compared the results with elemental and stable isotope data, to decipher OM provenance and to assess degradation/preservation dynamics. The results showed that: (1) the major biopolymers preserved were polysaccharides, polyphenolic moieties (lignin and tannin) and polymethylenic moieties (e.g. cutin, suberin, chlorophyll) with smaller apportions of proteins and resins; (2) the OM originates predominantly from vascular plant materials (in particular lignocellulose) that have been well-preserved, even in some of the oldest sediments; (3) mangroves were found to be the most efficient OC sinks, partially explained by syringyl lignin preservation; (4) seagrasses were shown to store polysaccharide-enriched OM; (5) large proportions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in surficial tidal marsh and mangrove sediments probably reflect pyrogenic OM from industrial combustion, and; (6) â€œecosystem shiftsâ€, i.e. mangrove encroachment in tidal marsh and transition from seagrass to mangrove, were detected. Deposition environment and source vegetation control OC sequestration and there is no specific recalcitrant form of OM that is selectively preserved. For the first time, we demonstrate how analytical pyrolysis in combination with stable isotope analysis can be used to reconstruct (palaeo-)ecological shifts between different BCE. This study improves our knowledge on OC accumulation dynamics and the response of BCE to environmental change, which can inform the implementation of strategies for climate change mitigation.

TI  - Integrated mangrove-shrimp cultivation: Potential for blue carbon sequestration
AB  - Globally, shrimp farming has had devastating effects on mangrove forests. However, mangroves are the most carbon-rich forests, with blue carbon (i.e., carbon in coastal and marine ecosystems) emissions seriously augmented due to devastating effects on mangrove forests. Nevertheless, integrated mangrove-shrimp cultivation has emerged as a part of the potential solution to blue carbon emissions. Integrated mangrove-shrimp farming is also known as organic aquaculture if deforested mangrove area does not exceed 50\% of the total farm area. Mangrove destruction is not permitted in organic aquaculture and the former mangrove area in parts of the shrimp farm shall be reforested to at least 50\% during a period of maximum 5 years according to Naturland organic aquaculture standards. This article reviews integrated mangrove-shrimp cultivation that can help to sequester blue carbon through mangrove restoration, which can be an option for climate change mitigation. However, the adoption of integrated mangrove-shrimp cultivation could face several challenges that need to be addressed in order to realize substantial benefits from blue carbon sequestration.

TI  - Blue carbon storage comparing mangroves with saltmarsh and seagrass habitats at a warm temperate continental limit
AB  - In South Africa, blue forests occur in sheltered estuaries where little is known about their carbon storage. This study was the first to quantify the carbon storage of blue forests at a warm temperate estuary in the Eastern Cape, the southern distributional limit for mangroves in Africa. Results showed that soil organic carbon was significantly higher in mangroves (228.08 Â± 27.99 Mg C/ha) compared with saltmarshes (2.61 Â± 0.19 Mg C/ha) and seagrasses (1.67 Â± 0.81 Mg C/ha). However, these values were less than the reported global means for blue carbon because of slower growth and productivity at latitudinal limits for mangroves, a drier climate, and coarse-grained soil. Even though carbon storage was limited, this chapter provides baseline data for South Africaâ€™s estuaries to partake in potential carbon credit trading schemes which will aid with the management and protection of mangrove habitats in future.

TI  - Leveraging Carbon Services of Coastal Ecosystems for Habitat Protection and Restoration
AB  - Coastal ``blue carbon,{''} (carbon sequestered in salt marsh, mangroves, and seagrasses) is a newly recognized benefit. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), with partners, has been exploring and developing new policy opportunities for coastal conservation using the climate benefits of these ecosystems. We detail NOAA's efforts (federal and international, market and non-market) to leverage blue carbon for coastal conservation including: (1) how blue carbon is or could be incorporated into U.S. federal policies (both existing and new policy activities); (2) market-based policy solutions including the development of a Verified Carbon Standard methodology for carbon credits for wetland restoration and two landscape assessments of the climate mitigation benefits of watershed-scale restoration; and (3) international efforts to build a North American community of practice for blue carbon science and policy with the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, Canada, and Mexico, and an assessment of where blue carbon can be incorporated into international policy frameworks (including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Wetlands Supplement and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)). Protecting coastal carbon leads to co-benefits including resilience to storms and erosion, and fishery benefits, thus blue carbon is a ``triple win{'' for climate mitigation, adaptation, and conservation.

TI  - Variability and Vulnerability of Coastal `Blue Carbon' Stocks: A Case Study from Southeast Australia
AB  - `Blue carbon' ecosystems-seagrasses, tidal marshes, and mangroves-serve as dense carbon sinks important for reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, yet only recently have stock estimates emerged. We sampled 96 blue carbon ecosystems across the Victorian coastline (southeast Australia) to quantify total sediment stocks, variability across spatial scales, and estimate emissions associated with historical ecosystem loss. Mean sediment organic carbon (C-org) stock (+/- SE) to a depth of 30 cm was not significantly different between tidal marshes (87.1 +/- 4.90 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and mangroves (65.6 +/- 4.17 Mg C-org ha(-1)), but was significantly lower in seagrasses (24.3 +/- 1.82 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Location (defined as an individual meadow, marsh, or forest) had a stronger relationship with C-org stock than catchment region, suggesting local-scale conditions drive variability of stocks more than regional-scale processes. We estimate over 2.90 million +/- 199,000 Mg C-org in the top 30 cm of blue carbon sediments in Victoria (53\% in tidal marshes, 36\% in seagrasses, and 11\% in mangroves) and sequestration rates of 22,700 +/- 5510 Mg C-org year(-1) (valued at over \$AUD1 million +/- 245,000 year(-1) based on the average price of \$AUD12.14 Mg CO2 eq(-1) at Australian Emissions Reduction Fund auctions). We estimate ecosystem loss since European settlement may equate to emissions as high as 4.83 million +/- 358,000 Mg CO2 equivalents (assuming 90\% remineralization of stocks), 98\% of which was associated with tidal marsh loss, and what would have been sequestering 9360 +/- 2500 Mg C-org year(-1). This study is among the first to present a comprehensive comparison of sediment stocks across and within coastal blue carbon ecosystems. We estimate substantial and valuable carbon stocks associated with these ecosystems that have suffered considerable losses in the past and need protection into the future to maintain their role as carbon sinks.

TI  - Heavy metal pollution increases CH4 and decreases CO2 emissions due to soil microbial changes in a mangrove wetland: Microcosm experiment and field examination
AB  - Mangrove plays an important role in modulating global warming through substantial blue carbon storage relative to their greenhouse gas emission potential. The presence of heavy metals in mangrove wetlands can influence soil microbial communities with implications for decomposition of soil organic matter and emission of greenhouse gases. In this study, field monitoring and a microcosm experiment were conducted to examine the impacts of heavy metal pollution on soil microbial communities and greenhouse gas fluxes. The results show that heavy metal pollution decreased the richness and diversity of the overall soil microbial functional groups (heterotrophs and lithotrophs); however, it did not inhibit the activities of the methanogenic communities, possibly due to their stronger tolerance to heavy metal toxicity compared to the broader soil microbial communities. Consequently, the presence of heavy metals in the mangrove soils significantly increased the emission of CH4 while the emission of CO2 as a proxy of soil microbial respiration was decreased. The soil organic carbon content could also buffer the effect of heavy metal pollution and influence CO2 emissions due to reduced toxicity to microbes. The findings have implications for understanding the complication of greenhouse gas emissions by heavy metal pollution in mangrove wetlands. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Mapping an urban ecosystem service: quantifying carbon storage in soils at an island-city on a wide scale
AB  - This study examined the temporal and spatial patterns of carbon storage in an island-city by evaluation of soils across the entire urban and mangrove forests areas during dry, rainy and norths seasons of 2013-2014. The ecosystem service (mitigation of climatic change) was quantified and mapped on a wide scale in Carmen Island, Campeche, Mexico by using geo-statistics methods. Carbon sequestration rate and several important physicochemical parameters on a wide scale in the city were determined at 30 cm depth, which is the most relevant depth affected by land management practices. An evident seasonal pattern was observed for organic carbon, exhibiting its highest levels at the beginning of the dry season. In addition, a geographical distribution analysis identified mangrove and flooded sites as those zones in which carbon storage was higher, concluding that hydrogeology and dominant vegetation were the factors with a greater influence on carbon storage rate. Carbon storage rate obtained in this work (1.07 Kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) was comparable with those obtained for isolated and forested wetlands in others regions of the world. This study is the first in the region that provides a high-resolution map of soil carbon stocks in a mixed and complex frame where an important urban zone and mangrove forest co-exist.

TI  - Net CO2 and CH4 emissions from restored mangrove wetland: New insights based on a case study in estuary of the Pearl River, China
AB  - Mangroves have the potential to affect climate via C sequestration and methane (CH4) emissions. With half of the world's mangroves lost during the 20th century, mangrove restoration in mitigating greenhouse gases has been increasingly recognized. However, the carbon exchanges during restored processes still remain large uncertain. In this study, we analyzed the temporal variations of CO2 and CH4 fluxes and their environmental controls during 2019 and 2020 based on a closed-path eddy covariance (EC) system in a 12-year restored subtropical mangrove wetland, in estuary of the Pearl River, southeastern China. We also estimated the CO2 and CH4 fluxes and their climate effect from the beginning of restoration by Random Forest algorithm (RF). The EC observations showed that annually the 12-year restored mangrove acted as CO2 and CH4 sources, with net CO2 ecosystem exchange (NEE) of 82-175 gCmiddotm- 2middota-1 and CH4 fluxes of 24.7-26.3 gCmiddotm-2middota-1. Low vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) and high ecosystem respiration (Re) caused net CO2 emissions in the mangroves. The estimation by RF indicated that the mangroves were always a CO2 source after the beginning of restoration, but the annual NEE was linearly decreased from 233 to 131 gCmiddotm-2middota-1 from 2008 to 2020. The annual CH4 emissions continually increased from 19.0 to 25.8 gCmiddotm-2middota-1 after restoration. As a result, the restored mangrove had a positive effect on climate warming, with increased GWP from 1276 to 1386 g CO2-eq middotm-2middota-1 from 2008 to 2020. This is mainly due to lower GPP and higher Re by young restored mangroves, large water area as well as low salinity induced strong CH4 emissions. Our results indicate new sights that young restored mangrove with large area of water surface may act as carbon sources. However, the longterm climate and ecosystem benefits due to mangrove restoration should not be ignored in future. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Above ground carbon sequestration in mangrove forest filtration system
AB  - The rate of above ground carbon sequestration was examined in mangrove forest filtration system pond wihnthe Kmg's Royally Initiated Laem Phak Bia Environmental Research and Development Project that located in Thailand. It is dvided into two sites: the study site and the reference site. The study site is the mangrove filtration system area where is drectly affected from the municipal waste water and the reference site is the mangrove forest area where is indrectly affected from the municipal wastewater at Ban Pranaen is located in the north of the cape. The relationships between tree diameter and tree height were used to evaluate above ground biomass by allometric equatiom and above ground carbon sequestration was calculated by multiplying the percentage of carbon stock. They were carried out two seasom: Wet and dry seasom. The results were revealed that the highest LAI in study site and reference site were 17.67 and 9.66, respectively. The highest above ground biomass was 1.42 and 2.12 t ha-1 in study site and reference site, respectively. The percentage of carbon content in the parts of sampled tree was slightly dfference in study and reference site. The average of highest above ground carbon sequestration was 11.08 and 2.32 t ha-1' in study site and reference site, respectively. Moreover, the results of comparison of LAI, above ground biomass and above ground carbon sequestration confirmed that the mangrove forest filtration system can be high potential of carbon stock source.

TI  - Carbon sequestration and sedimentation in mangrove swamps influenced by hydrogeomorphic conditions and urbanization in Southwest Florida
AB  - This study compares carbon sequestration rates along two independent tidal mangrovecreeks near Naples Bay in Southwest Florida, USA. One tidal creek is hydrologically disturbeddue to upstream land use changes; the other is an undisturbed reference creek. Soil cores werecollected in basin, fringe, and riverine hydrogeomorphic settings along each of the two tidal creeksand analyzed for bulk density, total organic carbon profiles, and sediment accretion. Radionuclides 137Cs and 210Pb were used to estimate recent sediment accretion and carbon sequestration rates.Carbon sequestration rates (mean Â± standard error) for seven sites in the two tidal creeks on theNaples Bay (98 Â± 12 g-C m-2Â· year-1 (n = 18)) are lower than published global means for mangrovewetlands, but consistent with other estimates from the same region. Mean carbon sequestration ratesin the reference riverine setting were highest (162 Â± 5 g-C m-2Â· year-1), followed by rates in thereference fringe and disturbed riverine settings (127 Â± 6 and 125 Â± 5 g-C m-2Â· year-1, respectively).The disturbed fringe sequestered 73 Â± 10 g-C m-2Â· year-1, while rates within the basin settingswere 50 Â± 4 g-C m-2Â· year-1 and 47 Â± 4 g-C m-2Â· year-1 for the reference and disturbed creeks,respectively. These data support our hypothesis that mangroves along a hydrologically disturbedtidal creek sequestered less carbon than did mangroves along an adjacent undisturbed reference creek.

TI  - Pathways for implementation of blue carbon initiatives
AB  - Coastal blue carbon activities are being implemented by a variety of countries, using different approaches. Existing regulatory regimes, including on coastal protection, are still very useful tools to protect and conserve mangroves, seagrasses and saltmarshes, and preserve their carbon value and role. These approaches suffer, however, from traditional' issues such as lack of enforcement, human and financial constraints as well as unclear or misguiding government mandates. Successes are witnessed using a community-based carbon project approach, ensuring high stakeholder participation via direct or indirect incentive programmes. Comprehensive coastal zone management approaches seem very promising, but success overall, and regarding carbon specifically, are yet to be reported. The Paris Agreement has introduced new tools which could serve as means to trigger more and better coastal adaptation and mitigation efforts. Their implementation details are, however, still under negotiation and their impacts can only be expected in a few years.

TI  - Carbon sequestration potential in the rehabilitated mangroves in Indonesia
AB  - Mangrove ecosystem provides important services for coastal communities. Unfortunately, this ecosystem has undergone physical pressures for decades, including land conversion for shrimp aquaculture. Rehabilitation of the degraded mangroves offers an effective solution for bringing back mangrove functions, including carbon sequestration capacity. This study aims to quantify carbon stock (CS) and sequestration rate of a rehabilitated mangrove ecosystem in Indonesia, particularly in Banten Province. We compared sediment CS and carbon accumulation rate (CAR) of a rehabilitated mangrove in Ciseukeut, Panimbang, with a natural mangrove in Cilintang, the Ujung Kulon National Park. The sediment CS to a depth of 1 m in a rehabilitated mangrove in Ciseukeut was higher than in a natural mangrove in Cilintang, constituting 364 Mg C ha(-1) and 126 Mg C ha(-1), respectively. However, CAR showed the opposite pattern, in which a natural mangrove showed an almost two-fold higher rate (0.50 +/- 0.42 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) than that of a rehabilitated mangrove (0.27 +/- 0.20 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)). Local hydrogeomorphological conditions play a role in affecting sediment CS and CAR in both sites. Enhancing hydrological modification can promote CAR, especially in an abandoned pond like in Ciseukeut. This study provided a knowledge base for suitable mangrove rehabilitation in the future that supports the Indonesian government's commitment to rehabilitating ca. 600,000 ha of degraded mangroves in Indonesia. Furthermore, the study also provides the first investigation of potential blue carbon for the world's natural heritage of the Ujung Kulon National Park.

TI  - Historical reconstruction of mangrove expansion in the Gulf of Mexico: Linking climate change with carbon sequestration in coastal wetlands
AB  - There has been considerable interest in a recently recognized and important sink in the global carbon pool, commonly referred to as ``blue carbon{''}. The major goal of this study was to determine the historical reconstruction of mangrove expansion (Avicennia germinans) into salt marshes (Spartina alterniflora) and its effects on carbon sequestration and soil chemistry in wetland soils of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. We used bulk stable isotopic, chemical biomarker analyses, and aerial imagery analysis to identify changes in OC wetland sources, and radiotracers (Cs-137 and Pb-210) for chronology. Soil cores were collected at two sites at Port Aransas, Texas (USA), Harbor Island and Mud Island. Stable isotopic values of delta C-13 and delta N-15 of all soil samples ranged from -26.8 to -15.6 parts per thousand and 1.8-10.4 parts per thousand and showed a significant trend of increasing depletion for each isotope from bottom to surface soils. The most depleted delta C-13 values were in surface soils at the Mud Island (Mangrove 2) location. Carbon sequestration rates were greater in mangroves and for the Mud Island Mangrove 1 and the Marsh 1 sites ranged from 253 to 270 and 101-125 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Lignin storage rates were also greater for mangrove sites and for the Mud Island Mangrove 1 and the Marsh 1 ranged from 19.5 to 20.1 and 16.5 to 12.8 g lignin m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. The Delta(8) and Delta(6) values for all cores ranged from 0.5 to 21.5 and 0.4 to 16.5, respectively, and showed a significant increase from bottom to surface sediments. If regional changes in the Gulf of Mexico are to persist and much of the marsh vegetation was to be replaced by mangroves, there could be significant increases on the overall storage and sequestration of carbon in the coastal zone.

TI  - Tidal dynamics and mangrove carbon sequestration during the Oligo-Miocene in the South China Sea
AB  - Modern mangroves are among the most carbon-rich biomes on Earth, but their long-term (>= 10(6) years) impact on the global carbon cycle is unknown. The extent, productivity and preservation of mangroves are controlled by the interplay of tectonics, global sea level and sedimentation, including tide, wave and fluvial processes. The impact of these processes on mangrove-bearing successions in the Oligo-Miocene of the South China Sea (SCS) is evaluated herein. Palaeogeographic reconstructions, palaeotidal modelling and facies analysis suggest that elevated tidal range and bed shear stress optimized mangrove development along tide-influenced tropical coastlines. Preservation of mangrove organic carbon (OC) was promoted by high tectonic subsidence and fluvial sediment supply. Lithospheric storage of OC in peripheral SCS basins potentially exceeded 4,000 Gt (equivalent to 2,000 p.p.m. of atmospheric CO2). These results highlight the crucial impact of tectonic and oceanographic processes on mangrove OC sequestration within the global carbon cycle on geological timescales.

TI  - Contribution of natural and drained wetland systems to carbon stocks, CO 2, N 2O, and CH 4 fluxes: An Australian perspective
AB  - Greenhouse gas (GHG) flux from wetland systems, both in their natural state and following drainage, has not been well accounted for in the carbon accounting process. We review GHG production from both natural and drained wetlands, and estimate the likely GHG emissions from these systems in Australia. Only a small number of studies have quantified GHG emissions from undisturbed Australian wetland environments. Consequently, in order to estimate GHG flux for Australia, it was necessary to collate data collected overseas from similar climatic zones. Using this approach, it appears that undisturbed, vegetated wetlands in Australia are likely to be net GHG sinks, with the greatest rates of sequestration occurring in mangrove ecosystems (2669g CO2-e/m 2.year) where biomass production is high but CH4 emissions are limited by salinity. The uncertainty surrounding these values is high, however, due to (a) the low number of measurements from Australia, (b) the low number of measurements for CO2 flux, and (c) the low number of studies where all GHGs have been measured concurrently. It was estimated that the drainage of melaleuca and mangrove forest wetlands in Australia would turn them from carbon sinks into carbon sources, and that in the first 50 years since drainage, this has increased global warming potential by 1149 Tg CO2-e or 23 Tg CO2-e/year. This is significant given that GHG emissions due to land-use change in 2007 totalled 77.1 Tg CO2-e. However, data surrounding the area of wetlands drained, carbon stocks in drained wetlands, and the effect of drainage on CH4 and N 2O flux are limited, making the uncertainty surrounding these estimates high. Further study is clearly required if Australia wishes to accurately incorporate wetland systems into national carbon and greenhouse gas accounting budgets. Â© CSIRO 2011.

TI  - Natural climate solutions in Indonesia: wetlands are the key to achieve Indonesia's national climate commitment
AB  - Indonesia offers a dramatic opportunity to contribute to tackling climate change by deploying natural climate solutions (NCS), increasing carbon sequestration and storage through the protection, improved management, and restoration of drylands, peatlands, and mangrove ecosystems. Here, we estimate Indonesia's NCS mitigation opportunity for the first time using national datasets. We calculated the maximum NCS mitigation potential extent using datasets of annual national land cover, peat soil, and critical lands. We collated a national emissions factor database for each pathway, calculated from a meta-analysis, recent publications from our team, and available literature. The maximum NCS mitigation potential in 2030 is 1.3 +/- 0.04 GtCO(2)e yr(-1), based on the historical baseline period from 2009-2019. This maximum NCS potential is double Indonesia's nationally determined contribution (NDC) target from the forestry and other land use sector. Of this potential opportunity, 77\% comes from wetland ecosystems. Peatlands have the largest NCS mitigation potential (960 +/- 15.4 MtCO(2)e yr(-1) or 71.5 MgCO(2)e ha(-1) yr(-1)) among all other ecosystems. Mangroves provide a smaller total potential (41.1 +/- 1.4 MtCO(2)e yr(-1)) but have a much higher mitigation density (12.2 MgCO(2)e ha(-1) yr(-1)) compared to dryland ecosystems (2.9 MgCO(2)e ha(-1) yr(-1)). Therefore, protecting, managing, and restoring Indonesia's wetlands is key to achieving the country's emissions reduction target by 2030. The results of this study can be used to inform conservation programs and national climate policy to prioritize wetlands and other land sector initiatives to fulfill Indonesia's NDC by 2030, while simultaneously providing additional co-benefits and contributing to COVID-19 recovery and economic sustainability.

TI  - Mangrove ecosystem C-stocks of Lamongan, Indonesia and its correlation with forest age
AB  - Mangrove forests are extremely productive ecosystems that provide a wide range of ecosystem services including a globally significant carbon (C) storage. However, the forests and their habitats have degraded as result of expanding agriculture, aquaculture industry and coastal development. The threats diminish their C sequestration capacities; consequently, C stored in the habitats would also be released, increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The purpose of this study was to estimate the ecosystem C-stocks of the mangrove forests of Lamongan, Indonesia and to assess the correlation between ecosystem C stocks and forest age. Sampling was carried out at 12 quadrat plots in four distinct areas to determine the biomass of above-And belowground trees, downed deadwood, saplings and seedlings, and soil C stocks. On average, the mangrove ecosystems of Lamongan stored 261.81 Â± 43.82 Mg C ha-1. The youngest (Â± 15year-old) and the oldest (Â± 100year-old) forest stored 167 Â± 22.9, and 349.95 Â± 106.5 Mg C ha-1 respectively, which significantly correlated with the forest ages. The %C of soil increased with depth and 46% of ecosystem C stocks was stored in the soil. As the soil was only sampled from the depth of 0-30 cm, the soil and ecosystem C stocks value could be much higher than the estimation. These findings suggest that the mangrove forests of Lamongan store a substantial amount of C; therefore, it is necessary to protect and sustainably manage them to minimize the anthropogenic threat.

TI  - Costs and Carbon Benefits of Mangrove Conservation and Restoration: A Global Analysis
AB  - Blue carbon in mangroves represents one of highest values of carbon stocks per hectare, and could play an important role in climate change mitigation. In this study we estimated the carbon prices needed to promote mangrove conservation and restoration under mechanisms of payment for ecosystem services (PES). We mapped the remaining and deforested mangroves across the globe in 2017, and crossed this information with carbon stocks in the biomass and soil and with land opportunity and restoration costs. In accordance with previous studies we found that Southeast Asia holds the largest opportunities for blue carbon programs to support conservation and restoration. Conserving remaining mangroves would avoid the release of up to 15.51 PgCO(2) to the atmosphere, and could be achieved at carbon prices between 3.0 and 13.0 US\$ per tCO(2) for 90\% of remaining mangroves. Restoring mangroves can sequester up to 0.32 PgCO(2) globally. Carbon prices between 4.5 and 18.0 US\$ per tCO(2) could support the restoration of 90\% of deforested mangroves. Such prices, however, may not apply to contexts of high-profit alternative land-uses. In such contexts, the valuation of co-benefits and the combination of carbon-based mechanisms and sustainable management may be a viable pathway.

TI  - Mangrove Above-Ground Biomass and Carbon Stock in the Karimunjawa-Kemujan Islands Estimated from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-Imagery
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems in the Karimunjawa Islands may play a vital role in absorbing and storing the releasing carbon from the Java Sea. The present study investigated mangrove above-ground biomass (AGB) and carbon stock in the Karimunjawa-Kemujan Islands, the largest mangrove area in the Karimunjawa Islands. Taking the aerial photos from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle combined with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements, we generated Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Terrain Model (DTM) with high accuracy. We calculated mangrove canopy height by subtracting DSM from DTM and then converted it into Loreyâ€™s height. The highest mangrove canopy is located along the coastline facing the sea, ranging from 8 m to 15 m. Stunted mangroves 1 m to 8 m in height are detected mainly in the inner areas. AGBs were calculated using an allometric equation destined for the Southeast and East Asia region. Above-ground carbon biomass is half of AGB. The AGB and carbon biomass of mangroves in the Karimunjawa-Kemujan Islands range from 8 Mg/ha to 328 Mg/ha, and from 4 MgC/ha to 164 MgC/ha, respectively. With a total area of 238.98 ha, the potential above-ground carbon stored in the study area is estimated as 16,555.46 Mg. Â© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Impacts of Climate Change on Blue Carbon Stocks and Fluxes in Mangrove Forests
AB  - Mangroves store blue carbon (693 Mg C-ORG ha(-1)) disproportionate to their small area, mainly (74\%) in deep soil horizons. Global stock estimates for mangroves (5.23-8.63 Pg C-ORG) are equivalent to 15-24\% of those in the tropical coastal ocean. Carbon burial in mangrove soils averages 184 g C-ORG m(-2) a(-1) with global estimates (9.6-15.8 Tg C-ORG a(-1)) reflecting their importance in carbon sequestration. Extreme weather events result in carbon stock losses and declines in carbon cycling and export. Increased frequency and ferocity of storms result in increasingly negative responses with increasing strength. Increasing temperatures result in increases in carbon stocks and cycling up to a critical threshold, while positive/negative responses will likely result from increases/decreases in rainfall. Forest responses to sea-level rise (SLR) and rising CO2 are species- and site-specific and complex due to interactive effects with other drivers (e.g., temperature, salinity). The SLR critical threshold is approximate to 6 mm a(-1) indicating survival only under very low-low CO2 emissions scenarios. Under low coastal squeeze, landward migration could result in sequestration and CO2 losses of 1.5 and -1.1 Pg C with net stock gains and losses (-0.3 to +0.5 Pg C) and CO2 losses (-3.4 Pg) under high coastal squeeze.

TI  - Accelerated Sea-Level Rise Limits Vegetation Capacity to Sequester Soil Carbon in Coastal Wetlands: A Study Case in Southeastern Australia
AB  - Estimates of global carbon stocks in coastal wetlands reveal that these are some of the most efficient carbon-sequestering environments in the world, which has prompted a renewed interest in conservation and restoration programs as an opportunity for greenhouse gas abatement. Accumulation of carbon in coastal wetlands is linked to diverse factors such as the type of vegetation, geomorphic setting, and sediment supply. Feedbacks between these factors and the tidal flow conditions drive the dynamics of carbon accumulation rates. Climate change-induced sea-level rise has been shown to increase the vulnerability to submergence of saltmarsh and mangroves in coastal wetlands, even if accommodation and landward colonization are possible. These potential losses of wetland vegetation combined with the reduced productivity of newly colonized areas will directly affect the capacity of the wetlands to sequester carbon from sediments and root growth. Here, we implement an eco-geomorphic model to simulate vegetation dynamics, soil carbon accumulation, and changes in soil carbon stock for a restored mangrove-saltmarsh wetland experiencing accelerated sea-level rise. We evaluate model outcomes for existing conditions and two different management scenarios aimed at mitigating sea-level rise effects and conserve wetland vegetation. Even though some management measures can result in partial conservation of wetland vegetation, they do not necessarily result in the best option for soil carbon capture. Our results suggest that accelerated sea-level can trigger accelerated wetland colonization resulting in wetland areas with limited opportunities for soil carbon capture from sediment and root mineralization, an issue that has not been considered in previous studies.

TI  - Variability in the organic carbon stocks, sources, and accumulation rates of Indonesian mangrove ecosystems
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are an important natural carbon sink that accumulate and store large amounts of organic carbon (C org ), in particular in the sediment. However, the magnitude of carbon stocks and the rate of carbon accumulation (CAR) vary geographically due to a large variation of local factors. In order to better understand the blue carbon sink of mangrove ecosystems, we measured organic carbon stocks, sources and accumulation rates in three Indonesian mangrove ecosystems with different environmental settings and conditions; (i) a degraded estuarine mangrove forest in the Segara Anakan Lagoon (SAL), Central Java, (ii) an undegraded estuarine mangrove forest in Berau region, East Kalimantan, and (iii) a pristine marine mangrove forest on Kongsi Island, Thousand Islands, Jakarta. In general, C org stocks were higher in estuarine than in marine mangroves, although a large variation was observed among the estuarine mangroves. The mean total C org stock in Berau (615 Â± 181 Mg C ha âˆ’1 ) is twice as high as that in SAL (298 Â± 181 Mg C ha âˆ’1 ). However, the Segara Anakan Lagoon displayed large within-system variation with a much higher C org stock in the eastern (483 Â± 124 Mg C ha âˆ’1 ) than in the central lagoon (167 Â± 36 Mg C ha âˆ’1 ). The predominant accumulation of autochthonous mangrove organic matter likely contributed to the higher C org stocks in Berau and the eastern SAL. Interestingly, the CAR distribution pattern in SAL is opposite to that of its C org stocks. The central SAL that receives high sediment inputs from the hinterland has a much higher CAR than the eastern SAL (658 Â± 311 g C m âˆ’2 yr âˆ’1 and 194 Â± 46 g C m âˆ’2 yr âˆ’1 , respectively), while Berau has one of the highest CAR (1722 Â± 183 g C m âˆ’2 yr âˆ’1 ) ever measured. It appears that these large differences are driven by the environmental setting and conditions, mainly sediment dynamics and hydrodynamics, landform, and vegetation conditions. It is inferred that quantifying carbon accumulation in sediments is a useful tool in estimating the present-day carbon storage of mangrove ecosystems. This is a precondition for taking measures under REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries) schemes.

TI  - Assessing the Effect of Age and Geomorphic Setting on Organic Carbon Accumulation in High-Latitude Human-Planted Mangroves
AB  - Mangroves are highly productive blue carbon ecosystems that preserve high organic carbon concentrations in soils. In this study, particle size, bulk elemental composition and stable carbon isotope were determined for the sediment cores collected from the landward and seaward sides of two mangrove forests of different ages (M1, ca. 60; M2, ca. 4 years old) to determine the effects of geomorphic setting and age (L1 = old mangrove and S1 = salt marsh stand in M1; L2 = young mangrove and S2 = bare mudflat in M2) on sediments and organic carbon accumulation. The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of the northernmost human-planted mangroves in China to accumulate sediment and carbon. Our results showed that fine-grained materials were preserved well in the interior part of the mangroves, and the capacity to capture fine-grained materials increased as the forest aged. The biogeochemical properties (C/N: 5.9 to 10.8; Î´13 C: âˆ’21.60â€° to âˆ’26.07â€°) indicated that the local organic carbon pool was composed of a mixture of autochthonous and allochthonous sources. Moreover, the accumulation of organic carbon increased with the forest age. The interior part of the old mangrove had the highest organic carbon stock (81.93 Mg Corg haâˆ’1). These findings revealed that mangrove reforestation had positive effects on sediments and organic carbon accretion. Â© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Development of Quantitative Real-Time PCR for Detecting Environmental DNA Derived from Marine Macrophytes and Its Application to a Field Survey in Hiroshima Bay, Japan
AB  - The sequestration and storage of carbon dioxide by marine macrophytes is called blue carbon; this ecosystem function of coastal marine ecosystems constitutes an important countermea-sure to global climate change. The contribution of marine macrophytes to blue carbon requires a detailed examination of the organic carbon stock released by these macrophytes. Here, we introduce a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based environmental DNA (eDNA) system for the species-specific detection of marine macrophytes. and report its application in a field survey in Hiroshima Bay, Japan. A method of qPCR-based quantification was developed for mangrove, seagrass, Phaeophyceae, Rhodophyta and Chlorophyta species, or species-complex, collected from the Japanese coast to investigate their dynamics after they wither and die in the marine environment. A trial of the designed qPCR system was conducted using sediment samples from Hiroshima Bay. Ulva spp. were abundant in coastal areas of the bay, yet their eDNA in the sediments was scarce. In contrast, Zostera marina and the Sargassum subgenus Bactrophycus spp. were found at various sites in the bay, and high amounts of their eDNA were detected in the sediments. These results suggest that the fate of macrophyte-derived organic carbon after death varies among species. Â© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Effects of exotic and native mangrove forests plantation on soil organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus contents and pools in Leizhou, China
AB  - The fast growing exotic Sonneratia apetala had been widely used to restore the mangroves in China. Planted mangroves play important roles in enhancing carbon sequestration and nutrient storage. The contents and pools of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) of simultaneously planted exotic S. apetala and native mixing mangrove (Avicennia marina, accompanied by Aegiceras corniculattum and Kandelia obovata) were quantified to evaluate the ecological restoration effects. Comparing with unvegetated mudflat, the colonization of mangrove can increase the SOC content within 60 cm and total nitrogen contents within 40 cm. No significant differences existed between S. apetala and native mangrove communities for the SOC, TN and TP contents. The restoration of mangrove forests enhanced the soil carbon stock relative to mudflat but significant differences existed only between native mangrove and mudflat. The TN and TP pools were not impacted by the plantation of mangroves. Therefore, plantation of S. apetala less than two decades did not show any advantages on the stocks of organic carbon and nutrients. The mixing native mangrove community should be recommended to enlarge the area of mangrove and enhance the carbon stock capability in the future.

TI  - Keys to successful blue carbon projects: Lessons learned from global case studies
AB  - Ecosystem services such as protection from storms and erosion, tourism benefits, and climate adaptation and mitigation have been increasingly recognized as important considerations for environmental policymalcing. Recent research has shown that coastal ecosystems such as seagrasses, salt marshes, and mangroves provide climate mitigation services because they are particularly effective at sequestering and storing carbon dioxide, referred to as ``coastal blue carbon{''}. Unfortunately, degradation of blue carbon ecosystems due to anthropogenic impacts contributes to anthropogenic carbon emissions from land use impacts and prevents these ecosystems from continuing to sequester and store carbon. Given the impressive carbon sequestration and storage in coastal ecosystems, many countries with blue carbon resources are beginning to implement blue carbon restoration projects using carbon financing mechanisms. This study analyzed four case studies of projects in Kenya, India, Vietnam, and Madagascar, evaluating the individual carbon financing mechanisms, the project outcomes, and the policy implications of each. Strengths and challenges of implementing blue carbon projects are discussed and considerations that all projects should address are examined in order to develop long-term sustainable climate mitigation or adaptation policies. This analysis can help to inform future project design considerations as well as policy opportunities. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Carbon stock assessment of mangroves using remote sensing and geographic information system
AB  - Mangrove forests are among the most carbon-rich habitats on the planet. The protection of mangroves for mitigation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as well as for multifaceted sustainable growth of ecosystem is of great scientific concern. Mangrove vegetation in Kerala is now restricted largely to river mouths and tidal creeks with about 15 species of mangroves and 8 associated species. Kannur holds the largest mangrove area in Kerala with an area of about 32 Km2. Located at 12Â°15â€² North and 75Â°13â€² East, Kunhimangalam, in Kannur district, has luxuriant mangroves. A considerable part of mangroves are undergoing destruction and over exploitation. There are organised attempts to acquire all the mangrove areas under private ownership by the real estate groups. Although a large scale conversion of the mangroves was prevented by the timely intervention of local people and NGOs, long term preservation of this system is under question. The urge to establish this mangrove as a protected area is very relevant in this context. The aim of the study is to promote restoration of these mangroves through community and government participation. The study integrates field inventory data with the satellite images. Analysis involves four major steps, namely, (i) Image processing, (ii) derivation of vegetation indices using satellite imagery (iii) ground truthing through field stratification and collection of field inventory data and (iv) calculation of carbon stock. The satellite image of 18th January 2015 is used for the study. Using ERDAS IMAGINE 9.2, the layers are stacked and given standard False Color Composite (FCC) for better vegetation analysis using ArcGIS. The vegetation indices (VIs) can estimate the biomass of mangroves from remote sensing images and the most appropriate one is the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). The NDVI is based on absorption in the red spectrum and very strong reflectance in the near infrared spectrum. Ground truthing is done to establish relationship between NDVI from Satellite imagery and Above-ground biomass (AGB) from field observations. Reference pixels are selected as those for which actual data are known. A regression equation is developed to calculate the AGB for the entire plot from the NDVI values in the imagery. Allometric equations for Above-ground biomass (AGB) and below-ground biomass (BGB) developed by Komiyama et al. (2005) is used in this study. The overall ratio of BGB to AGB is 0.38. Total biomass is taken as the sum of AGB and BGB. Carbon content can be obtained by multiplying the total biomass by a conversion factor 0.475. AGB values ranges from 636.832 gm to 32048.5 gm per pixel and BGB ranges from 241.996 gm to 12178.4 gm per pixel. Total biomass ranges from 878.828 gm to 44226.9 gm per pixel and carbon content per pixel ranges from 417.443 gm to 21007.8 gm. Of the total 70.6% is contributed by high class vegetation which is covering 61% of the total area. Medium class contributes 16.74% of carbon with coverage of 29.55% area and low class provide 12.66% carbon sequestration with 9.44% area coverage. Comparing the area coverage, high and low class vegetation type is more effective in contributing carbon sequestration. Low class vegetation area is mainly covered with dry grass which has low reflectance and low NDVI, but has high carbon content. Rhizhophora mucronata, Excoecaria agallocha and Bruguiera cylindrical are the species that contribute more. The estimated total carbon of 12.67 tonnes and presence of eight different mangrove species in an area of 12 acres indicates this mangrove forest is in good health. Â© 2018

TI  - Proximate composition of Xylocarpus moluccensis seeds and their oils
AB  - Mangroves play an important role in protecting shorelines, supporting the food web, and sequestering carbon. In addition, they offer protection against waves, winds, storms, and tsunamis. Indonesian mangrove resources are increasingly being lost due to unsustainable utilization and habitat conversion. Reclamation for aquaculture and agriculture is currently considered the main way to achieve the development of mangrove areas. However, these types of reclamation are costly and have adverse environmental effects. The isolation, identification, and utilization of valuable mangrove products, such as Xylocarpus moluccensis, are other ways to achieve the development of mangrove areas. X. moluccensis is a species of mangrove that has medicinal properties. However, its nutritive and lipids values have not been evaluated. In this study, the proximate composition and mineral content of X. moluccensis seeds, as well as the fatty acid composition of X. moluccensis seed oils, were investigated. The results revealed that X. moluccensis fruit seeds contained crude lipids (10.65-11.09%), crude proteins (4.76-10.14%), ash (10.07-11.59%), crude fibers (7.81-15.85%), and nitrogen free extract (e.g. carbohydrates (52.42-63.32%)). The seeds also contained copper (12.82. ppm), iron (20.25. ppm), manganese (16.22. ppm), zinc (5.89. ppm), potassium (621.98. ppm), and calcium (43.69. ppm). Myristic acid (C14:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), oleic acid (C18:1), linoleic acid (C18:2), linolenic acid (C18:3), arachidic acid (C20:0), and docosanoic acid (C22:0) were identified in the hexane extracts of X. moluccensis fruit seeds. It was found that mangrove seeds of moluccensis have potential as biodiesel feedstock due to their lipid content. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Role of vegetated coastal ecosystems as nitrogen and phosphorous filters and sinks in the coasts of Saudi Arabia
AB  - Vegetated coastal ecosystems along the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf coasts of Saudi Arabia thrive in an extremely arid and oligotrophic environment, with high seawater temperatures and salinity. Mangrove, seagrass and saltmarsh ecosystems have been shown to act as efficient sinks of sediment organic carbon, earning these vegetated ecosystems the moniker 'blue carbon' ecosystems. However, their role as nitrogen and phosphorus (N and P) sinks remains poorly understood. In this study, we examine the capacity of blue carbon ecosystems to trap and store nitrogen and phosphorous in their sediments in the central Red Sea and Arabian Gulf. We estimated the N and P stocks (in 0.2 m thick-sediments) and accumulation rates (for the last century based on 210Pb and for the last millennia based on 14C) in mangrove, seagrass and saltmarsh sediments from eight locations along the coast of Saudi Arabia (81 cores in total). The N and P stocks contained in the top 20 cm sediments ranged from 61 g N m-2 in Red Sea seagrass to 265 g N m-2 in the Gulf saltmarshes and from 70 g P m-2 in Red Sea seagrass meadows and mangroves to 58 g P m-2 in the Gulf saltmarshes. The short-term N and P accumulation rates ranged from 0.09 mg N cm-2 yr-1 in Red Sea seagrass to 0.38 mg N cm-2 yr-1 in Gulf mangrove, and from 0.027 mg P cm-2 yr-1 in the Gulf seagrass to 0.092 mg P cm-2 yr-1 in Red Sea mangroves. Short-term N and P accumulation rates were up to 10-fold higher than long-term accumulation rates, highlighting increasing sequestration of N and P over the past century, likely due to anthropogenic activities such as coastal development and wastewater inputs.

TI  - Fingerprinting macrophyte Blue Carbon by pyrolysis-GC-compound specific isotope analysis (Py-CSIA)
AB  - There is a need for tools to determine the origin of organic matter (OM) in Blue Carbon Ecosystems (BCE) and marine sediments to (1) facilitate the implementation of Blue Carbon strategies into carbon accounting and crediting schemes and (2) decipher changes in ecosystem condition over decadal to millennial time scales and thus to understand and predict the stability of BCE in a changing world. Pyrolysis-GC-compound specific isotope analysis (Py-CSIA) is applied for the first time in marine environments and BCE research. We studied Australian mangrove, tidal marsh and seagrass sediments, in addition to potential sources of OM (Avicennia, Posidonia, Zostera, Sarcocornia, Ecklonia and Ulva species and seagrass epiphytes), to identify precursors of different biomacromolecule constituents (lignin, polysaccharides and aliphatic structures). Firstly, the link between bulk Î´13C and Î´13C reconstructed from compound-specific Î´13C showed that the pyrolysis approach allows for the isotopic screening of a representative portion of the OM. Secondly, for all samples, the C isotope fingerprint of the carbohydrate products (plant polysaccharides) was the heaviest (13C enriched), followed by lignin and aliphatic products. The differences in Î´13C among macromolecules and the overlap in Î´13C among putative sources reflect the limitations of bulk Î´13C analyses for deciphering OM provenance. Thirdly, phanerogams specimen had the heaviest carbohydrate and lignin, confirming that seagrass-derived lignocellulose can be traced based on Î´13C. Consistent differences for individual compounds were identified between seagrasses and between Avicennia and Sarcocornia using Py-CSIA. Fourth, ecosystem shifts (colonization of seagrass habitats by mangrove) on millenary time scales, hypothesized in previous studies on the basis of bulk Î´13C and Py-GCâ€“MS, were confirmed by Py-CSIA. We conclude that Py-CSIA is useful in Blue Carbon research to decipher OM sources in marine sediments, identify ecosystem transitions in palaeoenvironmental records, and to understand the role of different OM compounds in Blue Carbon storage.

TI  - Carbon fluxes and stocks in a carbonate-rich chenier plain
AB  - Coastal wetlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle because they have high ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration capability. Previous research focused on the carbon dynamics of organic-rich ecosystems (e.g., salt marshes, mangroves), while little attention has paid to the carbon cycling of carbonate-rich ecosystems such as chenier plains, sandy or shelly beach ridges that are parts of strand plains. Here we examined the carbon stocks and fluxes of the poorly studied chenier plain in the Yellow River Delta, China. The inorganic and organic carbon pools in the top 1 m sediment were 444 +/- 92 Mg C ha(-1) and 89 +/- 7 Mg C ha(-1), respectively. The average CO2 net sequestration was -177 +/- 51 Mg C ha(-1), indicating that the chenier plain had a net CO2 evasion during the entire soil formation process. With plant growth, however, the chenier plain provided a significant carbon sink (395 g C m(-2) a(-1)) on a per-unit area basis. The annual gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (Re) were 1067 and 672 g C m(-2) a(-1), respectively. The carbon sink strength of the chenier plain was comparable to that of organic-rich salt marshes on a per-unit area basis. The biomass carbon pool was 5.0 +/- 1.4 Mg C ha(-1) in the chenier plain. Moreover, the sediment inorganic carbon content in mudflats was significantly lower than that of vegetated habitats. Our results showed that plant grown in a chenier plain could significantly enhance carbon sequestration by increasing organic carbon storage. Inorganic carbon storage should be considered in blue carbon inventories because inorganic carbon dominates the carbon pool and is important in the carbon cycling in a chenier plain. Our findings can help us better understand the carbon cycling of carbonate-rich coastal ecosystems and can inform chenier plain conservation and restoration efforts.

TI  - Ecosystem Carbon Stocks of Restored Mangroves and Its Sequestration in Northern Sumatra Coast, Indonesia
AB  - The 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 30-year restored mangroves were studied through non-destructive method by measuring their stem diameter and tree height. Two allometric references: (a) stem diameter (D30) and (b) combined quadratic stem diameter and tree height (D302H) were used to estimate aboveground and belowground vegetation carbon stocks. The soil samples were collected from different depth and analysed in laboratory for soil carbon. The objective of this study was to estimate ecosystem carbon stocks of restored mangroves and its sequestration. The growth of restored mangroves induced an increase of tree biomass and a corresponding increase in vegetation carbon stocks from 3.7 MgC ha-1 at 2-year to 136.8 MgC ha-1 at 30-years. However, soil carbon stocks among restored mangrove plots spread randomly and didn't follow the sequence of mangrove tree ages. Average (2-30 years) mangrove ecosystem carbon in Northern Sumatra estimated by D302H allometry (362.0 MgC ha-1) was higher than that estimated by D30 allometry (344.1 MgC ha-1). This higher trend was also followed by its carbon sequestration with values of 41.1 MgCO2e ha-1 yr-1 estimated by D302H allometry and 31.5 MgCO2e ha-1 yr-1 estimated by D30 allometry. It is concluded that the values of ecosystem carbon stock of restored mangroves and its sequestration estimated by combined quadratic stem diameter and tree height (D302H) are higher than if it is estimated by stem diameter (D30). The D302H value is higher because this allometry calculates the volume of the tree stem, while D30 allometry only calculates the surface of the stem. The range values of average ecosystem carbon sequestration of this study may be better used as a reference for Afforestation, Reforestation and Re-vegetation (ARR) verification than what has been used as default/conservative values.

TI  - A comparison of soil carbon pools across a mangrove-salt marsh ecotone at the southern African warm-temperate range limit
AB  - Mangroves and salt marshes are globally recognized for their ability to efficiently sequester and store carbon in biomass and soil carbon pools. An increase in soil carbon has been found at range limits where mangroves are expanding along ecotones into salt marsh, as mangroves store more carbon per unit area. However, the magnitude of this trend is variable at different mangrove range limits depending on the rates of expansion and the local climatic and geomorphological factors that influence current mangrove distribution. This study presents the first account of soil carbon storage across a mangrove-salt marsh ecotone at the Nahoon Estuary, a warm-temperate range limit for the east coast of the African continent. Soil carbon (to 50 cm depth) was compared between mangrove, salt marsh, and a transitional ecotone habitat. We found that soil carbon was highest at 30-50 cm below the surface across all habitats. The average soil carbon in the upper 50 cm was similar in mangrove (110.14 MgC.ha(-1)), ecotone (114.50 MgC.ha(-1)), and salt marsh habitats (109.62 MgC. ha(-1)). These results show that although mangroves have expanded at the Nahoon Estuary over the past 50 years, the soil carbon content is still similar across the mangrove-salt marsh ecotone. This is in contrast to other studies from southern hemisphere mangrove range limits in Australia. However, these trends have been reported at northern hemisphere range limits in the USA. Further studies in this region are needed to identify environmental factors influencing soil carbon variability. (C) 2019 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Soil greenhouse gas emissions reduce the contribution of mangrove plants to the atmospheric cooling effect
AB  - Mangrove soils have been recognized as sources of greenhouse gases, but the atmospheric fluxes are poorly characterized, and their adverse warming effect has rarely been considered with respect to the potential contribution of mangrove wetlands to climate change mitigation. The current study balanced the warming effect of soil greenhouse gas emissions with the plant carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration rate derived from the plants' net primary production in a productive mangrove wetland in South China to assess the role of mangrove wetlands in reducing the atmospheric warming effect. Soil characteristics were also studied in the summer to examine their relationships with gas fluxes. The soil to atmosphere fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and CO2 ranged from-1.6 to 50.0 mu gm(-2) h(-1), from-1.4 to 5360.1 mu gm(-2) h(-1) and from-31 to 512 mg m(-2) h(-1), respectively, which indicated that the mangrove soils act as sources of greenhouse gases in this area. The gas fluxes were higher in summer than in the cold seasons and were variable across mangrove sites. Gas fluxes in summer were positively correlated with the soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and ammonia contents. The mangrove plants sequestered a considerable amount of atmospheric CO2 at rates varying from 3652 to 7420 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1). The ecosystem acted as a source of CH4 and N2O gases but was a more intenseCO(2) sink. However, the warming effect of soil gas emissions accounted for 9.3-32.7\% of the plant CO2 sequestration rate, partially reducing the benefit of mangrove plants, and the two trace gases comprised 9.7-33.2\% of the total warming effect. We therefore propose that an assessment of the reduction of atmospheric warming effects by a mangrove ecosystem should consider both soil greenhouse gas emissions and plant CO2 sequestration.

TI  - Evaluation of carbon sequestration potential in undisturbed mangrove forest in TÃ©rminos Lagoon, Campeche
AB  - It was determined carbon sequestration potencial in mangrove forest soil located within the natural protected area named "TÃ©rminos Lagoon" in Carmen Island, Campeche-MÃ©xico. Six sampling zones were considered within a mangrove forest located in the Botanical Garden of the Autonomous University of Carmen City. Samplings were carried out from February to August during 2009 considering three climatic periods ("Norths" season, dry season and rainy season). The seasonal influence on carbon storage was evident (from 1.2 to 22.2 kg C / m-2), with the highest rate of carbon sequestration in the dry season, in flooded soils with greater predominance of red mangrove, and is lower in those soils rarely flooded with a higher prevalence of buttonwood mangrove individuals. The organic matter content and organic carbon was greater at 30 cm depth for flooded areas, where long periods of flood tides and low rates of decomposition maintain anoxic conditions. The sandy soils of the study areas with high pH values and red mangrove associations have a high potential for carbon sequestration and we can conclude that it can be increased in future years.

TI  - Carbon Stocks of Tropical Coastal Wetlands within the Karstic Landscape of the Mexican Caribbean
AB  - Coastal wetlands can have exceptionally large carbon (C) stocks and their protection and restoration would constitute an effective mitigation strategy to climate change. Inclusion of coastal ecosystems in mitigation strategies requires quantification of carbon stocks in order to calculate emissions or sequestration through time. In this study, we quantified the ecosystem C stocks of coastal wetlands of the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve (SKBR) in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. We stratified the SKBR into different vegetation types (tall, medium and dwarf mangroves, and marshes), and examined relationships of environmental variables with C stocks. At nine sites within SKBR, we quantified ecosystem C stocks through measurement of above and belowground biomass, downed wood, and soil C. Additionally, we measured nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from the soil and interstitial salinity. Tall mangroves had the highest C stocks (987 +/- 338 Mg ha(-1)) followed by medium mangroves (623 +/- 41 Mg ha(-1)), dwarf mangroves (381 +/- 52 Mg ha(-1)) and marshes (177 +/- 73 Mg ha(-1)). At all sites, soil C comprised the majority of the ecosystem C stocks (78-99\%). Highest C stocks were measured in soils that were relatively low in salinity, high in P and low in N: P, suggesting that P limits C sequestration and accumulation potential. In this karstic area, coastal wetlands, especially mangroves, are important C stocks. At the landscape scale, the coastal wetlands of Sian Ka'an covering approximate to 172,176 ha may store 43.2 to 58.0 million Mg of C.

TI  - Blue Carbon Ecosystems and Their Role in Climate Change Mitigation-An Overview
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems include mangroves and other tidal wetlands such as seagrasses and salt marshes. Coastal blue carbon is thought to provide climate change mitigation benefits in view of their ability to store carbon under adverse conditions and this in the recent times has garnered the attention of the scientific community at large. Mangroves are one of the most productive ecosystems and their carbon storage potential is much greater as compared to sea grasses and salt marshes. Mangroves sequester carbon in their living biomass as well as the sediments. The tropical Asian mangroves show the greatest mangrove diversity and the highest biomass accumulation. But, the carbon storage potential of their living biomass is outcompeted by their sedimentary carbon storage. Mangrove sediments play a special and quantitatively important role in carbon storage than previously thought. They store both autochthonous and allochthonous organic matter due to their strategic location at the interface between land and sea and prevailing reducing conditions. Indian mangrove ecosystems which also comprises one of the largest mangrove forest of the world may offer a possible opportunity for the development of blue carbon market economy. But there exist a large number of gaps in the available blue carbon literature. The available studies largely focus on the living biomass storage and sedimentary storage is un-surveyed. Mangrove research in India have shown significant growth in the past few decades but the targeted approach towards delineating the ecosystems' carbon stocks and the factors controlling them are still lacking. The need of the hour is to correctly map and document the mangroves in India for their carbon storage in order to build a better and reliable picture of the role of these ecosystems in climate change mitigation.

TI  - Managed Retreat of Saline Coastal Wetlands: Challenges and Opportunities Identified from the Hunter River Estuary, Australia
AB  - We analyse the potential impacts of sea-level rise on the management of saline coastal wetlands in the Hunter River estuary, NSW, Australia. We model two management options: leaving all floodgates open, facilitating retreat of mangrove and saltmarsh into low-lying coastal lands; and leaving floodgates closed. For both management options we modelled the potential extent of saline coastal wetland to 2100 under a low sea-level rise scenario (based on 5 % minima of SRES B1 emissions scenario) and a high sea-level rise scenario (based on 95 % maxima of SRES A1FI emissions scenario). In both instances we quantified the carbon burial benefits associated with those actions. Using a dynamic elevation model, which factored in the accretion and vertical elevation responses of mangrove and saltmarsh to rising sea levels, we projected the distribution of saline coastal wetlands, and estimated the volume of sediment and carbon burial across the estuary under each scenario. We found that the management of floodgates is the primary determinant of potential saline coastal wetland extent to 2100, with only 33 % of the potential wetland area remaining under the high sea-level rise scenario, with floodgates closed, and with a 127 % expansion of potential wetland extent with floodgates open and levees breached. Carbon burial was an additional benefit of accommodating landward retreat of wetlands, with an additional 280,000 tonnes of carbon buried under the high sea-level rise scenario with floodgates open (775,075 tonnes with floodgates open and 490,280 tonnes with floodgates closed). Nearly all of the Hunter Wetlands National Park, a Ramsar wetland, will be lost under the high sea-level rise scenario, while there is potential for expansion of the wetland area by 35 % under the low sea-level rise scenario, regardless of floodgate management. We recommend that National Parks, Reserves, Ramsar sites and other static conservation mechanisms employed to protect significant coastal wetlands must begin to employ dynamic buffers to accommodate sea-level rise change impacts, which will likely require land purchase or other agreements with private landholders. The costs of facilitating adaptation may be offset by carbon sequestration gains. Â© 2013 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.

TI  - Constraints and opportunities for market-based finance for the restoration and protection of blue carbon ecosystems
AB  - The restoration and protection of ``blue carbon{''} ecosystems - mangroves, seagrasses, and tidal marshes - has potential to offset greenhouse gas emissions and improve coastal livelihoods. However, realisation of this potential relies on global investment in restoration and protection, which in turn relies on appropriate funding mechanisms that are currently impeded by multiple constraints. Constraints include commercial considerations by private investors (including reliable estimates of financial returns, risk quantification and management, and supply chain impacts), regulatory and legal uncertainty (such as the complexity of property rights in coastal areas, policy coordination across jurisdictions, and stable policy consistent with the duration of blue carbon projects). There are, however, opportunities to improve on current practices, including better stakeholder engagement (including social license to operate, and knowledge transfer to promote best practices), and targeted use of public and philanthropic funding (to subsidise demonstration projects, reduce financial risk through collaterals, and promote low-profit but high co-benefit projects). In this paper, a strategy for the realisation of potential benefits through commercially viable and scientifically robust blue carbon initiatives is presented alongside insights and guidance for the policy, research, civil society, and private sectors to achieve these important long-term outcomes.

TI  - Abandoned Fishpond Reversal to Mangrove Forest: Will the Carbon Storage Potential Match the Natural Stand 30 Years after Reforestation?
AB  - Mangroves are essential carbon reserves, and their role in carbon sequestration is remarkable. However, anthropogenic pressures such as aquaculture development threatened this highly susceptible ecosystem. Thus, the need to rehabilitate abandoned aquaculture ponds is a must to offset the ecological losses over the economic gains derived from these mangrove land-use changes. Thus, we chose a reforestation site of a once heavily utilized fishpond devastated by a tsunami in the late 1970s in Zamboanga del Sur, Philippines. We then established a similar study plot in a nearby natural mangrove forest as a point of reference. We determined the heterogeneity in vegetation and estimated the aboveground and soil carbon storage capacities. We also examined the distinct changes in species composition and zonation from the seaward towards the landward zones. About 30 years after the abandoned fishpond rehabilitation, we found the tree density of the Rhizopora mucronata Lamk. and Avicenia marina (Forsk.) Vierh-dominated reforestation site was higher (271 trees haâˆ’1) compared to that of the Rhizophora apiculata Blume-dominated natural stand (211 trees haâˆ’1) (p &lt; 0.05). The total aboveground biomass at the natural mangrove forest was 202.02 Mg haâˆ’1, which was close to that of the reforestation site (195.19 Mg haâˆ’1) (p &gt; 0.05). The total aboveground C in the natural mangrove forest was 90.52 Mg C haâˆ’1, while that of the reforestation site was 87.84 Mg C haâˆ’1 (p &gt; 0.05). Surprisingly, the overall soil C content at the natural forest of 249.85 Mg C haâˆ’1 was not significantly different from that of the reforestation site with 299.75 Mg C haâˆ’1 (p &gt; 0.05). There was an increasing soil C content trend as the soil got deeper from 0â€“100 cm (p &lt; 0.05). The zonation patterns established across the landward to seaward zones did not affect the aboveground and soil carbon estimates (p &gt; 0.05). Our study highlights the effectiveness of abandoned fishpond rehabilitation and calls for continuous restoration of the remaining abandoned aquaculture ponds in the country because of their ability to sequester and store carbon. Lastly, their potential to store huge amounts of carbon that will counterbalance anthropogenic CO2 emissions is likewise highlighted. Â© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Assessing the risk of carbon dioxide emissions from blue carbon ecosystems
AB  - ``Blue carbon{''} ecosystems, which include tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows, have large stocks of organic carbon (Corg) in their soils. These carbon stocks are vulnerable to decomposition and - if degraded - can be released to the atmosphere in the form of CO2. We present a framework to help assess the relative risk of CO2 emissions from degraded soils, thereby supporting inclusion of soil Corg into blue carbon projects and establishing a means to prioritize management for their carbon values. Assessing the risk of CO2 emissions after various kinds of disturbances can be accomplished through knowledge of both the size of the soil Corg stock at a site and the likelihood that the soil Corg will decompose to CO2.

TI  - Organic carbon inventories in natural and restored Ecuadorian mangrove forests
AB  - Mangroves can capture and store organic carbon and their protection and therefore their restoration is a component of climate change mitigation. However, there are few empirical measurements of long-term carbon storage in mangroves or of how storage varies across environmental gradients. The context dependency of this process combined with geographically limited field sampling has made it difficult to generalize regional and global rates of mangrove carbon sequestration. This has in turn hampered the inclusion of sequestration by mangroves in carbon cycle models and in carbon offset markets. The purpose of this study was to estimate the relative carbon capture and storage potential in natural and restored mangrove forests. We measured depth profiles of soil organic carbon content in 72 cores collected fromsix sites (three natural, two restored, and one afforested) surrounding Muisne, Ecuador. Samples up to 1 m deep were analyzed for organic matter content using loss-on-ignition and values were converted to organic carbon content using an accepted ratio of 1.72 (g/g). Results suggest that average soil carbon storage is 0.055Â±0.002 g cm-3 (11.3Â±0.8% carbon content by dry mass, mean Â± 1 SE) up to 1 m deep in natural sites, and 0.058 Â± 0.002 g cm-3 (8.0 Â± 0.3%) in restored sites. These estimates are concordant with published global averages. Evidence of equivalent carbon stocks in restored and afforested mangrove patches emphasizes the carbon sink potential for reestablished mangrove systems. We found no relationship between sediment carbon storage and aboveground biomass, forest structure, or within-patch location. Our results demonstrate the long-termcarbon storage potential of natural mangroves, high effectiveness of mangrove restoration and afforestation, a lack of predictability in carbon storage strictly based on aboveground parameters, and the need to establish standardized protocol for quantifying mangrove sediment carbon stocks.

TI  - Carbon storage in coastal wetlands is related to elevation and how it changes over time
AB  - National and global scale initiatives to reduce loss and promote restoration of coastal ecosystems have leveraged the capacity of mangrove and saltmarsh to contribute to climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration. The success of these programs is predicated on reliable estimates of carbon storage and how this changes over time. Efforts to describe spatial variation in below-ground carbon storage have largely focussed on surface sediments, with few studies able to characterise carbon at greater soil depths. This study demonstrates that landscape position occupied by wetland vegetation influences both carbon storage and sources, and that understanding evolutionary infill of estuaries is crucial for characterising spatial variation in carbon storage. We focussed on coastal wetlands in southeast Australia where sea level has a long history of relative stability over the past few millennia. Under these conditions, we show that carbon storage varies across three depth zones in substrate: the active root zone (associated with distribution of contemporary vegetation), inactive root zone (associated with past environmental conditions) and subtidal zone (beyond the contemporary intertidal zone). This conceptual approach relates spatial variation in carbon storage to key processes influencing carbon addition and decomposition, and can be applied elsewhere depending on the sea-level history at the specific site. We demonstrate that models that define carbon storage in the context of variation in landscape position of vegetation in the tidal frame provide improved confidence required for blue carbon assessments.

TI  - Land cover changes reduce net primary production in tropical coastal peatlands of West Kalimantan, Indonesia
AB  - Tropical peat swamp forests are carbon-rich ecosystems that have been threatened by high rates of land use change (LUC). Despite the ecosystem's shifts from sequestering carbon (C) to emitting carbon, few studies have quantified the changes in ecosystem productivity associated with LUC in tropical peatlands. This study quantified net primary production (NPP) in intact peat swamp forests (PSF), logged forests (LPSF), early seral sites (ES), and smallholder oil palm plantations (OP) in a peat dome of West Kalimantan, Indonesia. All sites were dominated by peat forest prior to deforestation. The NPP of intact forests was 13.2Mg C ha(-1)year(-1) making it among the world's most productive terrestrial ecosystems, exceeding that of many tropical rainforests and similar to the most productive mangrove ecosystems (12.9Mg C ha(-1)year(-1)). Land cover change resulted in large shifts in NPP. Logged forest and early seral sites were <11.1Mg C ha(-1)year(-1). The NPP of oil palm plantations was 3.7Mg C ha(-1)year(-1). Aboveground NPP was recorded at 10.5Mg C ha(-1)year(-1) in forests, exceeding the NPP of LPSF, ES, and OP (8.9, 5.1, and 3.5Mg C ha(-1)year(-1), respectively). Early seral sites (5.7Mg C ha(-1)year(-1)) were estimated to have the highest belowground NPP (p=0.05). Root productivity in PSF, LPSF, and OP was 2.7, 2.1, and 0.2Mg C ha(-1)year(-1), respectively. Land use change and forest degradation have reduced the productivity of tropical peatlands.

AB  - Coastal wetlands have one of the highest carbon sequestration rates among the worldâ€™s natural ecosystems mainly because of their high primary productivity and low rate of ecosystem respiration. Meanwhile, they are often assumed to be minor sources of methane (CH4), a highly potent greenhouse gas (GHG), under the influence of high salinity. On the other hand, frequent inundation and anaerobic environment make coastal wetlands potential sources of CH4 if other favorable conditions are met. Accurate quantification of the magnitude and direction of biosphere-atmosphere exchange of GHGs, including carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4, is essential for a comprehensive assessment of the climatic impact of coastal wetlands. The eddy covariance technique allows for the direct, quasicontinuous, and long-term measurements of ecosystem-scale GHG fluxes and has been increasingly used in coastal wetland ecosystems. In this chapter, we briefly introduce the basics of the eddy covariance technique, followed by a synthesis of biosphere-atmosphere exchange of CO2 and CH4 in coastal mangroves and salt marshes, with a particular focus on the temporal variability and biophysical drivers.

TI  - Carbon outwelling and emissions from two contrasting mangrove creeks during the monsoon storm season in Palau, Micronesia
AB  - Mangroves sequester large amounts of carbon in soils but limited information is available on carbon losses from tropical mangrove systems. Here we quantify carbon outwelling, CO 2 emissions and pore-water exchange rates from two nearby (âˆ¼2 km apart) tropical mangrove creeks located in different geomorphic settings on the island of Palau, Micronesia during the monsoon storm season. On average, POC and pCO 2 were &gt;100% higher and DOC, DIC and TA were 62%, 25%, 16% higher, respectively, from Creek 1 (located within a semi-enclosed bay) than from Creek 2 (located along the coast adjacent to fringing reefs). Both creeks were net exporters of DIC, DOC, POC, TA and emitters of CO 2 . However, outwelling rates of POC, DIC and DOC and CO 2 emissions were 27-fold, 8-fold, 4-fold and 3-fold higher at Creek 1. DIC outwelling (37%) and CO 2 emissions (39%) were the major terms contributing to total carbon losses at Creek 1, whilst CO 2 emission (61%) was the major contributor at Creek 2. Monsoon storms appeared to explain the organic carbon dynamics whilst tidal pumping appears to drive the inorganic carbon dynamics at both creeks. Our data demonstrates the considerable heterogeneity of mangroves creeks that are in close proximity and subject to similar weather conditions but in differing geomorphological settings.

TI  - Global patterns of tree stem growth and stand aboveground wood production in mangrove forests
AB  - Mangrove forests provide important ecological and economic services including carbon sequestration and storage. The conservation and restoration of mangroves are expected to play an important role in mitigating climate change, and understanding the factors influencing mangrove stem growth and wood production are important in predicting and improving mangrove carbon sequestration and responses to environmental change. In this study, we collected data of individual diameter at breast height (DBH)growth rate and stand level aboveground wood production in both non-plantation (commonly termed as natural)mangroves and mangrove plantations across the world. Climatic factors, proxies of edaphic factors, as well as biological factors (e.g. mangrove species)were included as explanatory variables in the analyses to determine factors influencing the global patterns of tree growth rate and stand wood production of mangroves. Using hierarchical Classification and Regression Tree (CART)analysis we found interactions among environmental and biological factors in controlling mangrove tree growth rate and stand wood production. We also found different global patterns of tree growth rate and stand wood production between non-plantation mangroves and plantations. Climatic conditions (precipitation of driest season, precipitation seasonality)were the most important factors influencing the global pattern of tree DBH growth rate in non-plantation mangroves, with edaphic and biological characteristics also playing a role under specific climatic conditions. The global pattern of stand wood production in non-plantation mangroves was primarily determined by stand mean DBH growth rate of individual trees. However, in mangrove plantations management measures, specifically species selection and planting density, were the most important factors influencing the global patterns of tree growth rate and stand wood production. Our study provides parameters for a global estimation of long-term carbon sequestration in both non-plantation mangroves and mangrove plantations. In addition, our results help us better predict the dynamics of tree growth and carbon sequestration of non-plantation mangroves under changing climate. Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The age and species composition of mangrove forest directly influence the net primary productivity and carbon sequestration potential
AB  - Although mangroves inhabit only 0.7\% of global coastal zone, but they have a significant contribution to the global carbon. Primary production by mangroves provides a substantial source of energy for aquatic food webs. Net primary productivity and carbon sequestration potential play a pivotal role in understanding the characteristics of the forest ecosystem. Therefore, in order to assess whether the age of mangrove forest and species composition has any influence on the net primary productivity and carbon sequestration potential; six plots of different age group (2, 7, 8, 12, 13 yrs and natural population), and mangrove species combinations were studied in Pichavaram mangrove forest, Tamil Nadu, India. Soil temperature, net canopy photosynthesis and forest functional index significantly varied between mangrove species and age. Regression analysis showed that the soil pH and bulk density positively influenced the carbon sequestration potential which was significant between age group. Higher age group (13yrs) and the natural site showed two-fold higher (21.52 +/- 0.72 gC/m(2)/day) net canopy photosynthesis. Forest functional index, shoot Biomass, root Biomass, plant biomass, carbon biomass and CO2 equivalent showed significant variation with species or age having maximum value in natural plot. Net primary productivity was significant between mangrove species or age. However, carbon sequestration potential increased with the increase in age of plants. Maximum carbon sequestration potential was found in Xylocarpus mekongensis. The data obtained from the present study can be effectively used for drafting conservation and management policies for the fragile mangrove forest ecosystem.

TI  - Global patterns of aboveground carbon stock and sequestration in mangroves
AB  - In order to contribute to understand the factors that control the provisioning of the ecosystem service of carbon storage by mangroves, data on carbon stock and sequestration in the aboveground biomass (AGB) from 73 articles were averaged and tested for the dependence on latitude, climatic parameters, physiographic types and age. Global means of carbon stock (78.0 +/- 64.5 tC. ha(-1)) and sequestration (2.9 +/- 2.2 tC. ha(-1). yr(-1)) showed that mangroves are among the forest ecosystems with greater capacity of carbon storage in AGB per area. On the global scale, carbon stock increases toward the equator (R-2 = 0.22) and is dependent on 13 climatic parameters, which can be integrated in the following predictive equation: Carbon Stock in AGB = -16.342 + (8.341 x Isothermality) + (0.021 x Annual Precipitation) {[}R-2 = 0.34; p < 0.05]. It was shown that almost 70\% of carbon stock variability is explained by age. Carbon stock and sequestration also vary according to physiographic types, indicating the importance of hydroperiod and edaphic parameters to the local variability of carbon stock. By demonstrating the contribution of local and regional-global factors to carbon stock, this study provides information to the forecast of the effects of future climate changes and local anthropogenic forcings on this ecosystem service.

TI  - The economic evaluation of carbon storage and sequestration as ecosystem services of mangroves: A case study from southeastern Brazil
AB  - Although mangroves are recognized by high capacity of carbon storage and sequestration, few studies have been dedicated to determine the monetary value of this ecosystem service. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to assign monetary values to this service in a protected area (Southeastern Brazil). This economic valuation was performed considering preexisting estimates of carbon storage and sequestration in the aboveground biomass of these forests and average transaction values of carbon credits. The mean values of the service of carbon sequestration varied according to the physiographic type from 19.00 Â± 10.00 US$ ha-1 yr-1 (basin forests, high intertidal) to 82.28 Â± 32.10 US$ ha-1 yr-1 (fringe forests, low intertidal). Considering the area occupied by each physiographic type, the service of carbon sequestration may be worth up to 455,827 US$ yr-1. In regard to carbon storage, 3,477,041 US$ are stored in these forests, and values between 104,311 and 208,622 US$ ha-1 yr-1 can be considered as the annual maintenance cost of this service. The income generated by future projects for the maintenance of carbon-related functions may represent a major advance for the conservation of this ecosystem. Â© 2014 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Use of Hyperion for Mangrove Forest Carbon Stock Assessment in Bhitarkanika Forest Reserve: A Contribution Towards Blue Carbon Initiative
AB  - Mangrove forest coastal ecosystems contain significant amount of carbon stocks and contribute to approximately 15\% of the total carbon sequestered in ocean sediments. The present study aims at exploring the ability of Earth Observation EO-1 Hyperion hyperspectral sensor in estimating aboveground carbon stocks in mangrove forests. Bhitarkanika mangrove forest has been used as case study, where field measurements of the biomass and carbon were acquired simultaneously with the satellite data. The spatial distribution of most dominant mangrove species was identified using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classifier, which was implemented using the spectral profiles extracted from the hyperspectral data. SAM performed well, identifying the total area that each of the major species covers (overall kappa = 0.81). From the hyperspectral images, the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) were applied to assess the carbon stocks of the various species using machine learning (Linear, Polynomial, Logarithmic, Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Sigmoidal Function) models. NDVI and EVI is generated using covariance matrix based band selection algorithm. All the five machine learning models were tested between the carbon measured in the field sampling and the carbon estimated by the vegetation indices NDVI and EVI was satisfactory (Pearson correlation coefficient, R, of 86.98\% for EVI and of 84.1\% for NDVI), with the RBF model showing the best results in comparison to other models. As such, the aboveground carbon stocks for species-wise mangrove for the study area was estimated. Our study findings confirm that hyperspectral images such as those from Hyperion can be used to perform species-wise mangrove analysis and assess the carbon stocks with satisfactory accuracy.

TI  - Carbon Pool in Mexican Wetland Soils: Importance of the Environmental Service
AB  - Mexican wetlands are not included in Earth system models around the world, despite being an important carbon store in the wetland soils in the tropics. In this review, five different types of wetlands were observed (marshes, swamps, flooded grasslands, flooded palms and mangroves) in which their carbon pool/carbon sequestrations in Mexican zones were studied. In addition, it was shown that swamps (forested freshwater wetlands) sequestered more carbon in the soil (86.17 +/- 35.9 Kg C m(-2)) than other types of wetlands (p = 0.011); however, these ecosystems are not taken into consideration by the Mexican laws on protection compared with mangroves (34.1 +/- 5.2 Kg C m(-2)). The carbon pool detected for mangrove was statistically similar (p > 0.05) to data of carbon observed in marshes (34.1 +/- 5.2 Kg C m(-2)) and flooded grassland (28.57 +/- 1.04 Kg C m(-2)) ecosystems. The value of carbon in flooded palms (8.0 +/- 4.2 Kg C m(-2)) was lower compared to the other wetland types, but no significant differences were found compared with flooded grasslands (p = 0.99). Thus, the carbon deposits detected in the different wetland types should be taken into account by policy makers and agents of change when making laws for environmental protection, as systematic data on carbon dynamics in tropical wetlands is needed in order to allow their incorporation into global carbon budgets.

TI  - Gaps, challenges, and opportunities in mangrove blue carbon research: A biogeographic perspective
AB  - The high carbon (C) sequestration and storage capacity of mangroves place these ecosystems in the center of the scientific community interests. As a result, publication of articles on mangrove C stocks has escalated over the last decade. Few among these publications have attempted to deliver global C stocks in mangroves. Despite methodological intricacies, these global assessments converge in being constrained by the data availability and quality. Recent global analyses have highlighted that about 50% of the countries where mangroves thrive lack data on C stored in both biomass and soils. For below-ground biomass (roots), the number of reliable estimates is even more limited. These issues with data availability and quality pose challenges to coastal wetlands scientists to account for the spatial variability of blue C stocks in mangroves, particularly when using predictive models based on environmental correlates. We collated extensive data sets on mangrove biomass and soil organic C and used a worldwide classification of coastline typologies to rank mangroves into distinct types of coastal environmental settings, including river-dominated (large river and small deltas), tidal systems, lagoons, carbonate, and arheic settings. We examined trends in mangrove C storage and sequestration rates across biogeographic provinces and show how the coastal environmental setting framework can improve global estimates. Finally, we deliver a biogeographic perspective on gaps and opportunities that we hope assist coastal wetlands scientists defining research strategies to address current challenges in mangrove blue C macroecology.

TI  - Beyond burial: Lateral exchange is a significant atmospheric carbon sink in mangrove forests
AB  - The blue carbon paradigm has evolved in recognition of the high carbon storage and sequestration potential of mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass ecosystems. However, fluxes of the potent greenhouse gases CH4 and N2O, and lateral export of carbon are often overlooked within the blue carbon framework. Here, we show that the export of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and alkalinity is approximately 1.7 times higher than burial as a long-term carbon sink in a subtropical mangrove system. Fluxes of methane offset burial by approximately 6%, while the nitrous oxide sink was approximately 0.5% of burial. Export of dissolved organic carbon and particulate organic carbon to the coastal zone is also significant and combined may account for an atmospheric carbon sink similar to burial. Our results indicate that the export of DIC and alkalinity results in a long-term atmospheric carbon sink and should be incorporated into the blue carbon paradigm when assessing the role of these habitats in sequestering carbon and mitigating climate change.

TI  - Carbon stock in three mangrove forests in north Persian Gulf
AB  - Pars Special Economic Energy Zone (PSEEZ) in the north of the Persian Gulf has made major changes to the landscape of the Nayband mangrove forest in Iran, but there have been very few studies on the carbon in mangrove forests of the region. To study the carbon stock of the mangrove forests in Bushehr, and to compare it according to the distance from PSEEZ, some mangrove forests, including 6 stations in Asalouyeh, 2 stations in Basatin (close to PSEEZ), and 1 station in Malegonzeh (far from the PSEEZ) were sampled in November 2018. The carbon of trees was calculated by allometry equations and the carbon of sediment was measured by the Walkley and Black method. The results showed a significant difference between the forests in biomass, carbon of vegetation, and sediments (P &lt; 0.05). The carbon stock of the mangrove vegetation was 34.92, 12.50, and 27.54 t haâˆ’1 in Asalouyeh, Basatin, and Malegonzeh forests, respectively, while the carbon stock of sediments was 867.4, 728.4, and 612.6 t haâˆ’1 in the mentioned forest, respectively. The highest total carbon was observed in the Asalouyeh and the lowest was observed in the Malegonzeh. The pattern of carbon was different in the sediment depth profile in the three forests. The rate of the carbon storage was 6.6 t haâˆ’1 yâˆ’1 and 3.33 t haâˆ’1 yâˆ’1 in Asalouyeh and Basatin, respectively. The carbon and CO2 sequestration rate in Basatin was lower than Asalouyeh. According to the results, mangrove forests in the area can act as a carbon sequestration service against the CO2 emitted by PSEEZ, if their habitats are not destroyed. The rate of the CO2 sequestration was 22.46 t haâˆ’1 yâˆ’1 in Nayband forest. The carbon stock was 640.14â€“902.32 t haâˆ’1, which was equal to and greater than the carbon stock of the other mangroves in the world.

TI  - Glomalin-related soil protein enriched in 5 13 C and 5 15 N excels at storing blue carbon in mangrove wetlands
AB  - Glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) derived from arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can be transported from land to sea and captured in mangrove wetlands, thereby contributing to soil C and N pools. However, the stable isotope signatures of GRSP and the key influencing factors that affect its isotope values in coastal wetlands remain unknown. In this study, the results showed that total-GRSP (T-GRSP) was a significant contributor of C and N content to mangrove soil. We first compared stable isotope (delta C-13 and delta N-15) values and C/N ratios of GRSP with those of other blue carbon sources in a typical mangrove wetland. The isotope fingerprints of T-GRSP, mangrove soils, mangrove plants, and tidal waters were identified. Unlike those of the conventional sources, the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of T-GRSP were -25.04 parts per thousand to -22.83 parts per thousand and 3.22 parts per thousand to 7.24 parts per thousand, respectively, and the mean C/N ratio was 12.95 in the mangrove cover sites. These findings indicated that T-GRSP is a novel blue carbon source mainly originating from terrestrial ecosystems. Moreover, the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of T-GRSP in mangrove wetlands were affected by vegetation interception and soil properties. Redundancy analysis results indicated that pH, moisture, depth, and salinity were key factors influencing the T-GRSP isotope fingerprints in mangrove wetlands. Additionally, the simultaneous changes in T-GRSP content, isotope values, and C/N ratios among mangrove cover sites, a mudflat, and tidal waters suggested that this protein is a sensitive tracer between land and sea. Overall, the isotope signatures of GRSP captured by mangroves were identified for the first time, which will have important implications for the estimation of the blue carbon budget and identification of the blue carbon sources in global coastal regions.

TI  - Control of ``blue carbon{''} storage by mangrove ageing: Evidence from a 66-year chronosequence in French Guiana
AB  - The role of mangroves in the blue carbon stock is critical and requires special focus. Mangroves are carbon-rich forests that are not in steady-state equilibrium at the decadal time scale. Over the last decades, the structure and zonation of mangroves have been largely disturbed by coastal changes and land use conversions. The amount of time since the last disturbance is a key parameter determining forest structure, but it has so far been overlooked in mangrove carbon stock projections. In particular, the carbon sequestration rates among mangrove successional ages after (re)establishment are poorly quantified and not used in large-scale estimations of the blue carbon stock. Here, it is hypothesized that ecosystem age structure significantly modulates mangrove carbon stocks. We analysed a 66-year chronosequence of the aboveground and belowground biomass and soil carbon stock of mangroves in French Guiana, and we found that in the year after forest establishment on newly formed mud banks, the aboveground, belowground and soil carbon stocks averaged 23.56 +/- 7.71, 13.04 +/- 3.37 and 84.26 +/- 64.14 (to a depth of 1 m) Mg C/ha, respectively. The mean annual increment (MAI) in the aboveground and belowground reservoirs was 23.56 x Age(-0.52) and 13.20 x Age(-0.64) Mg C ha(-1) year(-1), respectively, and the MAI in the soil carbon reservoir was 3.00 +/- 1.80 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). Our results show that the plant carbon sink capacity declines with ecosystem age, while the soil carbon sequestration rate remains constant over many years. We suggest that global projections of the above-and belowground reservoirs of the carbon stock need to account for mangrove age structures, which result from historical changes in coastal morphology. Our work anticipates joint international efforts to globally quantify the multidecadal mangrove carbon balance based on the combined use of age-based parametric equations and time series of mangrove age maps at regional scales.

TI  - Variation in sediment organic carbon stock in Bhitarkanika wetlands, India
AB  - Wetlands are known to sequester atmospheric CO2 in biomass and sediments, often referred to as ``blue carbon{''} of the ocean. The present research has tried to focus on depth-wise (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40 and 40-50 cm) profile of sediment organic carbon (OC) along with temperature, pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and bulk density (BD) seasonally in Bhitarkanika wetlands at five different locations for two years 2016-17 and 2017-18, respectively. Variation of sediment temperature with depth ranged from 21.32 +/- 0.76 to 34.13 +/- 0.58 degrees C, pH ranged from 4.8 +/- 0.28 to 6.6 +/- 0.75, EC ranged from 0.167 +/- 0.08 to 1.814 +/- 1.89 Sm-1, BD ranged from 740 +/- 0.06 to 125 +/- 0.17 kg m(-3) and OC ranged from 0.24 +/- 0.14 to 3.57 +/- 0.80 \%, respectively. Variation of OC between season, depth and stations has been proved through ANOVA analysis. The study revealed approximately 22.45 +/- 11.24 to 63.51 +/- 37.84 t ha(-1) CO2 equivalent is being absorbed by the sediment compartment in this mangrove ecosystem, confirming the potentiality of mangrove sediment as a sink of carbon dioxide.

TI  - Annual characteristics of gross primary productivity (GPP) in mangrove forest during 2016-2020 as revealed by Sentinel-2 remote sensing imagery
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most responsible gas in the phenomenon of global warming on earth because of its greatest concentration and longevity in the long atmosphere. Meanwhile mangrove is one of the blue carbon parameters that can take CO2 for photosynthesis and store it into biomass and sediment, so the existence of Mangrove plays a key role in the balance of the global carboncycle. Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) is one of the key variables in conducting a carboncycle study because the GPP values constitute the total value of carbon fixation by terrestrial ecosystem through vegetation photosynthesis. The aim of this study is to recognize the annual characteristics of GPP values in the mangrove ecosystem using remote sensing satellite Sentinel-2 during the period of 2016 to 2020 in TAHURA Ngurah Rai, Bali, Indonesia. The vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM) model is used to calculate annual GPP by using remote sensing indices of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI). Both remote sensing indices are supported by temperature and solar radiation data to determine photosynthesis fraction. The results of the current study indicated that the annual GPP values in the mangrove forest of TAHURA Ngurah Rai have decreased during the observation year. The total value of GPP in 2016 is reached to 28790 tC m-2 year-1, while the total amount of GPP value in 2020 decrease to 26223 tC m-2 year-1. The decline in GPP values may be due to changes of land cover and mangrove mortality that occurred around Benoa port in 2018. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Plant invasion reshapes the latitudinal pattern of soil microbial necromass and its contribution to soil organic carbon in coastal wetlands
AB  - An emerging consensus is reached that microbial necromass carbon (MNC) significantly contributes to the for-mation and stabilization of soil organic carbon (SOC). Yet less is known about how plant invasion regulates MNC accumulation in coastal ``Blue Carbon{''} ecosystems, and the environmental and microbial controls on MNC distribution across large scales are not well revealed. Here, we evaluated the contribution of MNC to SOC across a broad scale in coastal habitats including salt marshes and mangroves before and after exotic Spartina alterniflora Loisel. invasion. Specifically, we explored the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on soil MNC accumulation in paired native and invaded soils. The MNC pool was quantitatively inferred by analyzing soil microbial amino sugar content. We found that soil MNC contents significantly increased from temperate salt marshes to tropical mangroves, and the average MNC in mangrove soils was 1.3-5.0 times that in salt marshes. In native soils, the estimated contribution of MNC to SOC decreased along the climatic gradient, ranging from 13.4\% to 61.2\%. However, the invasion homogenized the latitudinal variation of MNC/SOC as the invasion reduced the contri-bution of soil MNC to SOC in salt marshes but increased the accumulation of microbial residues in mangrove habitats. Furthermore, MNC derived from fungi was 3.6-19.0 times that of bacteria and the contribution of fungal MNC to total MNC decreased against the increasing mean annual temperatures. The soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and soil texture had significant negative effects on MNC/SOC, indicating that soil nutrient sta-tus and physical protection are vital abiotic controls in regulating MNC accumulation in coastal wetlands. In summary, these findings revealed that MNC considerably contributes to soil carbon sequestration in coastal ecosystems, and emphasized that plant invasion can change the latitudinal pattern of MNC accumulation by altering environmental and microbial attributes and thus influencing soil carbon stabilization.

TI  - Differential Capacity of Carbon Sequestration Potential: Analyzing Avicennia marina and Salicornia brachiata along the South-Eastern Coast of India
AB  - The various plant parts of a mangrove, Avicennia marina and a salt marsh, Salicornia brachiata, namely leaves, stems, and roots from Tamil Nadu, India, were analyzed for variation in their carbon sequestration potential for a period during July 2019 to August 2020. The investigations were done using a carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur analyzer. The carbon (C) concentration for different seasons revealed a maximum value of 447.26 g C kg-1 (44.726\%) in leaves of A. marina recorded during premonsoon months at Nagapattinam, and the minimum of 269.57 g C kg-1 (26.957\%) in the roots during monsoon season at Thoothukudi. Similarly, the maximum value of 514.08 g C kg-1 (51.408\%) was recorded in leaves of S. brachiata during post-monsoon at Nagapattinam and the minimum of 183.26 g C kg-1 (18.326\%) during monsoon in roots at Thoothukudi. The physicochemical parameters such as bulk density, pH, sediment organic matter, and microbial loads of A. marina and S. brachiata reported considerable variation. The mean value of soil organic carbon in A. marina was 24.92 g C kg-1 and 8.04 g C kg-1 in S. brachiata. There was a significant difference in sediment organic matter between the stations (p . 0.01). Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy was carried out to identify the functional groups such as amides amines, carbonyl-containing compounds, and alcohols in the sediments of both the species; it was observed that a major broadband around 3621 cm-1 assigned to be due to hydrogen-bonded O-H stretching vibration and another band around 1052 cm-1 due to C-N stretch. Regardless of their significance, information on the current spatial dispersion (event and degree) of mangroves and salt marshes is fragmented.

TI  - Biomass Carbon Stock Assessment of Mangrove Ecosystem in Pannikiang Island South Sulawesi Indonesia
AB  - One of the essential services provided by mangroves is carbon sequestration, and therefore climate change mitigation. While previous assessments of mangrove carbon stocks and sequestrations have focused on the estuarine and deltaic mangrove setting, there are still limited studies carried out at small island mangroves. The study aims to assess mangrove biomass carbon stocks in Pannikiang, a small island in South Sulawesi, Indonesia, which occupies 91.64 ha of species-rich pristine mangrove forests. A field-based data collection survey was performed using a circular plot approach, while above-ground tree carbon (AGC) and below-ground root carbon (BGC) stocks were estimated using available species-specific allometric equations. The mean AGC and BGC were 5.34 Â± 0.17 and 1.68 Â± 0.04 Mg C ha-1, respectively. Bruguiera gymnorrhiza mangrove species stored the greatest of carbon stocks, followed by Scyphiphora hydrophyllacea. Carbon stocks obtained from small island mangroves in this study were lower than stocks assessed from other mangrove locations across Indonesia and Southeast Asia. However, historical rates of deforestation in Pannikiang Island may generate emissions to approximately 82.17 Mg CO2-eq. Findings from this study will be beneficial in providing baseline data for policy decision-making on climate change mitigation in the region, specifically for improved land use management via a low carbon development agenda.

TI  - Carbon sequestration and fluxes of restored mangroves in abandoned aquaculture ponds
AB  - There has been a growing interest in restoring mangroves to reduce and offset carbon (C) emissions, but it is still unknown whether restored mangroves provide blue carbon' services similar to natural ones. This study aimed to determine if 10 year-old restored mangroves in abandoned aquaculture ponds in Perancak Estuary, Bali have similar net primary productivity (NPP) and C sequestration to those of intact mangroves. Tidal re-instatement in the ponds has occurred and facilitated mangrove regeneration and sediment accumulation. We found that NPP were similar between natural and restored mangroves. Soil C sequestration in restored mangroves was similar to the natural mangroves, but the soil respiration (CO2 efflux) was lower. The source of C in mangrove sediments was mainly of mangrove origin, confirming the role of NPP in sediment C sequestration. We suggest that many components of the carbon cycle of the mangroves have been restored within 10 years since the reestablishment of the mangrove.

TI  - The mangrove blue carbon sink potential: Evidence from three net primary production assessment methods
AB  - Mangrove forests are among the highest carbon (C) sinks in the tropics and subtropics worldwide. Net primary productivity (NPP) is estimated by the permanent plot method with litterfall plus incremental growth (LG) and has great significance for the evaluation of the carbon sequestration capacity of forests. Here, we developed a new high-resolution method, sap flow investigation (SF), for the evaluation of carbon sequestration capacity. We also compared the forest carbon sequestration capacity estimated using two NPP estimation methods, stand water use using SF and light attenuation/gas exchange (LA), with traditional permanent plots using the LG method in four typical mangrove forests in the Futian Mangrove Reserve of Shenzhen City, China. The LG results showed that mangrove forests had NPPs ranging from 7.67 to 11.87 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), with species-specific differences. Among the three methods, the LG method is the most widely used, although it is costly and difficult to implement in the field. The LA results showed seasonal variation of NPP, with 4.69 g C m(-2) d(-1) in summer and 2.02 g C m(-2) d(-1) in winter. The LA method is relatively simple, but it requires a homogeneous canopy structure with a simple canopy extinction coefficient, which is suitable for mangroves with homogenous canopy structures. Although costly, the most convenient and efficient method is the SF method, which can realize continuous and high-precision dynamic NPP monitoring at the stand scale. After standardization by the LG method, the two high-resolution NPP methods could be used in mangrove forests with different time scales. For the global scale, after modification by the correction method provided in our study, the error caused by the determination method could be eliminated, which could make the global database more plentiful and accurate.

TI  - Low Carbon sink capacity of Red Sea mangroves
AB  - Mangroves forests of Avicennia marina occupy about 135 km2 in the Red Sea and represent one of the most important vegetated communities in this otherwise arid and oligotrophic region. We assessed the soil organic carbon (C-org) stocks, soil accretion rates (SAR; mm y(-1)) and soil C-org sequestration rates (g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)) in 10 mangrove sites within four locations along the Saudi coast of the Central Red Sea. Soil C-org density and stock in Red Sea mangroves were among the lowest reported globally, with an average of 4 +/- 0.3 mg Corg cm(-3) and 43 +/- 5 Mg C-org ha(-1) (in 1 m-thick soils), respectively. Sequestration rates of C-org, estimated at 3 +/- 1 and 15 +/- 1 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1) for the long (millennia) and short (last century) temporal scales, respectively, were also relatively low compared to mangrove habitats from more humid bioregions. In contrast, the accretion rates of Central Red Sea mangroves soils were within the range reported for global mangrove forests. The relatively low C-org sink capacity of Red Sea mangroves could be due to the extreme environmental conditions such as low rainfall, nutrient limitation and high temperature, reducing the growth rates of the mangroves and increasing soil respiration rates.

TI  - Estimation of biomass, carbon stocks and soil sequestration of Gowatr mangrove forests, Gulf of Oman
AB  - The mangrove forest ecosystem is known to possess a variety of ecosystem services, including high rates of carbon sequestration, storage and mitigating climate change through reduced deforestation. This study was carried out in the mangrove forests of Gowatr Bay, Gulf of Oman during 2017-18 to quantify biomass and carbon stocks of all components of this forest, including live and dead trees, soil, pneumatophores, herbaceous and litter in three stations during post-monsoon and pre-monsoon. We examined that biomass, carbon stocks and soil carbon varied significantly with spatial locations (p&lt;0.05) abut not with seasons (p&gt;0.05). The mean of biomass and carbon stock were estimated 125.54Â±19.31 and 129.21Â±19.64 Mg ha-1, and 48.48Â±7.51 and 49.9Â±7.5 Mg ha-1, in post-monsoon and pre-monsoon, respectively. Also, Soil carbon was determined 227.1Â±11.86 and 227.3Â±11.71 Mg ha-1 in post-monsoon and pre-monsoon, respectively. A positive correlation was found between the vegetation biomass and soil organic carbon in post-monsoon (r=0.905) and pre-monsoon (r=0.914), indicating the role of vegetation in building soil organic carbon. The mean carbon stock value for the total area of mangroves in post-monsoon and pre-monsoon was extrapolated as 43.9 and 44.2 Kt of C, equivalent to 161.13 and 162.102 Kt of CO2, respectively. This data reveals that Gowatr mangroves store a substantial amount of atmospheric carbon, and therefore need to be conserved and sustainably managed to maintain as well as to increase carbon storage.

TI  - Organic carbon burial and sources in soils of coastal mudflat and mangrove ecosystems
AB  - Mangrove organic carbon is primarily stored in soils, which contain more than two-thirds of total mangrove ecosystem carbon stocks. Despite increasing recognition of the critical role of mangrove ecosystems for climate change mitigation, there is limited understanding of soil organic carbon sequestration mechanisms in undisturbed low-latitude mangroves, specifically on organic carbon burial rates and sources. This study assessed soil organic carbon burial rates, sources and stocks across an undisturbed coastal mudflat and mangrove hydrogeomorphological catena (fringe mangrove and interior mangrove) in Bintuni Bay, West Papua Province, Indonesia. Pb-210 radionuclide sediment dating, and mixing model of natural stable isotope signatures (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and C/N ratio were used to estimate organic carbon burial rates and to quantify proportions of allochthonous (i.e., upland terrestrial forest) and autochthonous (i.e., on-site mangrove forest) organic carbon in the top 50 cm of the soil. Burial rates were in the range of 0.21-1.19 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Compared to the fringe mangroves, organic carbon burial rates in interior mangroves were almost twice as high. Primary productivity of C3 upland forest vegetation and mangroves induced soil organic carbon burial in interior mangroves and this was consistent with the formation of the largest organic carbon stocks (179 +/- 82 Mg C ha(-1)). By contrast, organic carbon stored in the fringe mangrove (68 +/- 11 Mg C ha(-1)) and mudflat (62 +/- 10 Mg C ha(-1)) soils mainly originated from upland forests (allochthonous origin). These findings clearly indicate that carbon sequestered and cycling in mangrove and terrestrial forest ecosystems are closely linked, and at least a part of carbon losses (e.g., erosion) from terrestrial forests is buried in mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - Analysis of Carbon Stock Distribution of Mangrove Forests in The Coastal City of Benoa, Bali with Combination Vegetation Index, and Statistics Approach
AB  - Mangrove forests have an essential role in reducing the impact of global warming in the urban and surrounding areas; one of them is through carbon sequestration. Carbon sequestration is needed to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The capacity of carbon sequestration or carbon stocks of mangrove forests can be seen from its biomass value. This study aims to produce a regression model between the vegetation index and the carbon stock of mangrove forests so that carbon stocks can be seen easily from satellite imagery and analyze their distribution in the Coastal City of Benoa, Bali. The distribution of carbon stocks was analyzed using a combination of vegetation index approach and statistical regression analysis. The vegetation index used is ARVI and EVI obtained from processing Sentinel 2-A satellite imagery in 2020. Mangrove forest biomass values are derived from allometric equations. After getting the amount of biomass, a regression model was built with a vegetation index. The model with the highest level of accuracy is used to process the image of the whole mangrove forest. This studyâ€™s results indicate that the regression model formed by the ARVI has the highest level of accuracy compared to the EVI, with the best regression model for predicting carbon stock values is the exponential regression model with an ARVI vegetation index variable. High carbon stock values are distributed in almost all regions of Benoa Bay. Â© 2020. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Estuarine submerged aquatic vegetation habitat provides organic carbon storage across a shifting landscape
AB  - Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) thrives across the estuarine salinity gradient providing valuable ecosystem services. Within the saline portion of estuaries, seagrass areas are frequently cited as hotspots for their role in capturing and retaining organic carbon (C-org). Non-seagrass SAV, located in the fresh to brackish estuarine areas, may also retain significant soil C-org, yet their role remains unquantified. Given rapidly occurring landscape and salinity changes due to human and natural disturbances, landscape level carbon pool estimates from estuarine SAV habitat blue carbon estimates are needed. We assessed C-org stocks in SAV habitat soils from estuarine freshwater to saline habitats (interior deltaic) to saline barrier islands (Chandeleur Island) within the Mississippi River Delta Plain (MRDP), Louisiana, USA. SAV habitats contain C-org stocks equivalent to those reported for other estuarine vegetation types (seagrass, salt marsh, mangrove). Interior deltaic SAV C-org stocks (231.6 +/- 19.5 Mg C-org ha(-1)) were similar across the salinity gradient, and significantly higher than at barrier island sites (56.6 +/- 10.4 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Within the MRDP, shallow water SAV habitat covers up to an estimated 28,000 ha, indicating that soil C-org storage is potentially 6.4 +/- 0.1 Tg representing an unaccounted C-org pool. Extrapolated across Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico, this represents a major unaccounted pool of soil C-org. As marshes continue to erode, the ability of coastal SAV habitat to offset someof the lost carbon sequestration may be valuable. Our estimates of C-org sequestration rates indicated that conversion of eroding marsh to potential SAV habitat may help to offset the reduction of C-org sequestration rates. Across Louisiana, we estimated SAV to offset this loss by as much as 79,000Mg C yr(-1) between the 1960s and 2000s. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ecosystem-level carbon stocks and sequestration rates in mangroves in the CananÃ©ia-Iguape lagoon estuarine system, southeastern Brazil
AB  - Mangroves fringe the coastlines of 54% of the world's nations but convey ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration, that span administrative boundaries. Despite their high carbon sequestration efficiency and long-term storage capacity, few countries have assembled detailed mangrove carbon inventories. For example, Brazil, which detains the second largest mangrove area in the world, still lacks a detailed inventory on its blue carbon resources, largely due to the scarcity of integrated ecosystem-level (that is, carbon stored in biomass and soil combined) carbon assessments. Here we combine published and unpublished data to derive an inventory on ecosystem-level carbon stocks and carbon sequestration rates in the CananÃ©ia-Iguape lagoon estuarine system, southeastern Brazil. We find that mangroves in the study area have the largest per-unit-area ecosystem-level carbon stocks at 380 MgC haâˆ’1 when compared to other Brazilian mangroves. Soil organic carbon stocks (top meter) account for 70% of this total. Annual carbon sequestration in mangrove soils and woody biomass combined with carbon fluxes via litterfall total 0.16 TgC yrâˆ’1. Degradation of mangrove ecosystems in this region could lead to CO2e emissions up to 1,395 MgCO2 haâˆ’1 and reduce annual carbon sequestration in soil and biomass combined, and carbon flux via litterfall by 27 and 12 MgCO2 haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1, respectively. Our results provide coastal wetlands managers and scientists with novel information on mangrove carbon stocks and sequestration rates in the study area, which is useful to strengthen regional blue carbon and potential CO2e emission inventories. These estimates can also be used to establish performance measures to inform restoration targets as well as to serve as a baseline for comparison with current and future measurements of carbon stocks and fluxes in response to environmental change.

TI  - Contemporary Rates of Carbon Sequestration Through Vertical Accretion of Sediments in Mangrove Forests and Saltmarshes of South East Queensland, Australia
AB  - Mangrove forests and saltmarshes are important habitats for carbon (C) sequestration in the coastal zone but variation in rates of C sequestration and the factors controlling sequestration are poorly understood. We assessed C sequestration in Moreton Bay, South East Queensland in mangrove forests and tidal marshes that span a range of environmental settings and plant communities, including mangrove forests and tidal marshes on the oligotrophic sand islands of the eastern side of Moreton Bay and on the nutrient enriched, western side of the bay adjacent to the city of Brisbane. We found that rates of C sequestration in sediments were similar among mangrove forests over the bay, despite large differences in the C density of sediments, because of different rates of vertical accretion of sediments. The C sequestration on the oligotrophic sand island tidal marshes, dominated by Juncus kraussii, had the highest rate of C sequestration in the bay while the western saltmarshes, which were dominated by Sarcocornia quinqueflora, had the lowest rate of C sequestration. Our data indicate C sequestration varies among different tidal wetland plant community types, due to variation in sediment characteristics and rates of sediment accretion over time.

TI  - Carbon stocks and accumulation rates in Red Sea seagrass meadows
AB  - Seagrasses play an important role in climate change mitigation and adaptation, acting as natural CO2 sinks and buffering the impacts of rising sea level. However, global estimates of organic carbon (C-org) stocks, accumulation rates and seafloor elevation rates in seagrasses are limited to a few regions, thus potentially biasing global estimates. Here we assessed the extent of soil C-org stocks and accumulation rates in seagrass meadows (Thalassia hemprichii, Enhalus acoroides, Halophila stipulacea, Thalassodendrum ciliatum and Halodule uninervis) from Saudi Arabia. We estimated that seagrasses store 3.4 +/- 0.3 kg C-org m(-2) in 1 m-thick soil deposits, accumulated at 6.8 +/- 1.7 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1) over the last 500 to 2,000 years. The extreme conditions in the Red Sea, such as nutrient limitation reducing seagrass growth rates and high temperature increasing soil respiration rates, may explain their relative low C-org storage compared to temperate meadows. Differences in soil C-org storage among habitats (i.e. location and species composition) are mainly related to the contribution of seagrass detritus to the soil C-org pool, fluxes of C-org from adjacent mangrove and tidal marsh ecosystems into seagrass meadows, and the amount of fine sediment particles. Seagrasses sequester annually around 0.8\% of CO2 emissions from fossil-fuels by Saudi Arabia, while buffering the impacts of sea level rise. This study contributes data from understudied regions to a growing dataset on seagrass carbon stocks and sequestration rates and further evidences that even small seagrass species store C-org in coastal areas.

TI  - Role of carbonate burial in Blue Carbon budgets
AB  - Calcium carbonates (CaCO3) often accumulate in mangrove and seagrass sediments. As CaCO3 production emits CO2, there is concern that this may partially offset the role of Blue Carbon ecosystems as CO2 sinks through the burial of organic carbon (C-org). A global collection of data on inorganic carbon burial rates (C-inorg, 12\% of CaCO3 mass) revealed global rates of 0.8 TgC(inorg) yr(-1) and 15-62 TgC(inorg) yr(-1) in mangrove and seagrass ecosystems, respectively. In seagrass, CaCO3 burial may correspond to an offset of 30\% of the net CO2 sequestration. However, a mass balance assessment highlights that the C-inorg burial is mainly supported by inputs from adjacent ecosystems rather than by local calcification, and that Blue Carbon ecosystems are sites of net CaCO3 dissolution. Hence, CaCO3 burial in Blue Carbon ecosystems contribute to seabed elevation and therefore buffers sea-level rise, without undermining their role as CO2 sinks.

TI  - Comparing carbon sequestration and stand structure of monoculture and mixed mangrove plantations of Sonneratia caseolaris and S. apetala in Southern China
AB  - Mangroves are one of the most carbon-rich tropical ecosystems. Two fast-growing mangrove species of the genus Sonneratia, the native S. caseolaris and non-native S. apetala, have been widely used for mangrove reforestation in China; however their ability to sequester carbon is still unclear. The present study aimed to estimate the growth, carbon accumulation in biomass and carbon sequestration in sediments of these two species, in both mixed (50% S. caseolaris; 50% S. apetala) and monoculture plantations, in the intertidal zones of Shenzhen Bay, Guangdong Province, China. Twenty-five months of observation showed strong competition between the two species in the mixed plantation, with the native S. caseolaris outcompeting the non-native S. apetala due to a faster growth rate. Although S. caseolaris in the mixed plantation had lower carbon storage in biomass than in monoculture, carbon accumulation in sediment was higher in the mixed plantation. Thus, the relative advantage of the mixed plantation was in sequestering more carbon in sediment, as opposed to high carbon accumulation to biomass. These results indicated that the mixed plantation could be a good option for mangrove restoration and carbon sequestration of sediment. However, the two and a half years of this study may not indicate long-term trends, so more research on long-term species performance is essential for successful mangrove reforestation.

TI  - Underestimated PAH accumulation potential of blue carbon vegetation: Evidence from sedimentary records of saltmarsh and mangrove in Yueqing Bay, China
AB  - Sediments of blue carbon vegetation are becoming a sink of natural and anthropogenic pollutants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). However, the extent to which PAHs are accumulated and varied in blue carbon sediments, and the impact of blue carbon vegetation on the accumulation and retention capacity of PAHs, have been poorly explored. This study examines the sedimentary records of PAHs in profiles from mangrove plantation, saltmarsh, and mudflat in Ximen Island and Maoyan Island of Yueqing Bay, China. The existence of blue carbon vegetation provides a sheltered environment for the accelerated burial of sediment and OC. Decadal PAH sedimentation records show staged changes characterized by the emission of PAHs and colonization of blue carbon vegetation, reflecting the accelerated burial of PAHs in sediments by blue carbon vegetation colonization. In addition, the colonization of blue carbon vegetation contributes to the shift of PAH compositions in sediments. This study provides new insights into the underestimated PAH accumulation potential and retention capacity of blue carbon vegetation and the corresponding underlying sediments, supporting the environmental benefits of blue carbon vegetation.

TI  - Soil carbon stocks and accumulation in young mangrove forests
AB  - Mangrove reforestation and afforestation programs have been initiated in many countries recently to compensate for historical losses. At the same time, awareness of the high carbon (C) sink potential of mangrove forests is growing, and C sequestration is beginning to be considered among forestation goals. To assess whether and at what rate C accumulates in the soil of young mangrove forests following afforestation, we conducted a field study at an afforestation project in southeast China, including repeated measures taken over six years at two young forests (consisting of Kandelia obovata and Sonneratia apetala, aged 0-6 years old), and also a chronosequence of forests aged 0 (mudflat), 6 (both species), 20 (S.apetala), and 70 (K.obovata) years old. In the repeated measures, surface (0-10cm) soil C concentration (%C of dry soil mass) increased significantly over six years, from 1.14% to 1.52% (K.obovata) and 1.23% to 1.68% (S.apetala). The rates of increase did not differ significantly between the two species, despite much greater biomass of S.apetala. In the chronosequence, soil C also increased with age across sites, but only the 70-year-old forest was statistically different, suggesting that localized environmental differences may obscure age-related patterns in soil C. At all sites, soil C concentration for 1-m soil depth (0.62%-2.43%) was low compared to published global averages, yet the estimated soil C accumulation rate (155gCm-2y-1) was comparable to published averages for mature forests. We supported this field study with a literature review of similar studies containing soil C concentration data from young mangrove forests: data compiled from 15 studies, comprising 31 sites, showed consistent, positive changes in soil C concentration with forest age, even in the youngest (&lt;5 years old) forests, supporting our field observation that soil C increases over time following mangrove afforestation.

TI  - Mangrove Mapping Using SPOT 6 at East Lombok Indonesia
AB  - Accumulated biomass estimation in mangrove forest is important for assessing its productivity and sustainability. It is also important on revealing the potential amount of carbon that can be emitted in the form of carbon dioxide when deforestation took place. Mangrove as a part of the coastal ecosystem is related to Blue Carbon, especially in controlling climate change. This is due to its ability in utilizing carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and store it in stock biomass and sediment. This study addressed to estimate the mangrove extent at East Lombok as a part of One Map Mangrove Bali - Nusa Tenggara, and also trying to estimate its above ground biomass (AGB). Those are indispensable, especially for eastern part of Lombok which has the greatest mangroves area and mostly in good condition such as Gili Lawang and Gili Sulat. Forest biomass can be estimated through combination of field measurement and remote sensing - GIS methods. SPOT 6 and another high resolution-imagery were used as primary remotely sensed data. On screen digitation using RGB-NIR bands and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) image transformation are applied for the initial canopy density classification. For field measurement at 2016, plot sample sized 10 m x 10 m were used for mangrove parameter inventory. Non-destructive biomass estimation applied in this research which is applicable for mangrove ecosystems, using allometric equations. AGB estimation model also applied in mangrove area at two small islands. Bruguiera sp. and Rhizopora sp. dominated in East Lombok. While, Sonneratia sp., and Avicennia sp dominantly appeared in seaward zone of mangrove zonation. The spatial analysis resulted mangrove area in East Lombok is 1759.5778 ha. The estimation results of above ground biomass (trees and saplings) using 12 sample plots in East Lombok is 12,667.316 kg, while there are 881,677 kg of AGB of mangrove in Gili Lawang and Gili Sulat based on the AGBs model applied.

TI  - The role of reactive iron in long-term carbon sequestration in mangrove sediments
AB  - PurposeDespite occupying only 0.5\% of the global coastal ocean, mangroves play a disproportionately large role in the capture and retention of atmospheric carbon dioxide as organic carbon (OC) in its sediments. However, the capacity of mangrove sediments to store high amounts of OC has never been explained mechanistically. This study elucidates the role of reactive iron (Fe-R) in long-term carbon sequestration in mangrove sediments.Materials and methodsSediment samples of up to 1m in depth were collected from six selected mangrove areas across the Philippines. The samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). A citrate-bicarbonate-dithionite reduction procedure was employed to extract Fe-R from the sediments. The OC concentration and C-13 signatures before and after Fe-R extraction were determined using a dichromate oxidation technique and isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS), respectively.Results and discussionXRD diffractograms showed that the mangrove sediment samples varied in terms of mineralogical characteristics, which reflected their different parent materials. It was found that the OC concentration increased exponentially (OC=8.38e(0.37FeR); R-2=0.88; p<0.0001) with increasing Fe-R concentration. C-13 signatures of Fe-R-associated OC revealed that Fe-R preferentially preserved terrestrial over marine-derived organic matter. Finally, Fe-R was estimated to coprecipitate with up to 5.44x10(12)g OC in mangrove sediments per year.ConclusionsThe findings of this study suggest that Fe-R is responsible for the preservation of OC, thus making mangrove sediments a giant rusty sponge for carbon. This mechanistic understanding of thelong-term carbon storage in mangrove sediments could help draft better strategies for blue carbon initiatives that include the mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - Carbon storage of a tropical mangrove forest in Mui Ca Mau National Park, Vietnam
AB  - Mangrove forests constitute the most important sink of carbon (C) in the tropics, the conservation of which is an essential mean in offsetting C emissions and climate change. Mangrove forests are therefore suggested to be an important component of reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD+) schemes, which require scrupulous quantification of ecosystem C storage in order to monitor temporal C sequestration and emissions. Despite this, proportionally less is known about ecosystem C storage of mangrove forests in Vietnam, where these systems constitute a large proportion of its coastline. In this study, ecosystem C storage of a tropical mangrove forest in Mui Ca Mau National Park, Vietnam (CMNP) was quantified by measuring biomass of trees, roots, and downed woody debris, and sediment organic C and overall depth. Results showed that above- and below-ground C stock ranged from 90.2Â±15.8 to 115.2Â±19.3 and from 629.0Â±32.5 to 687.0Â±29.2MgCha-1, respectively. The combination of the above- and below-ground C stocks resulted in a high ecosystem C storage, which ranged from 719.2Â±38.0 to 802.1Â±12.3MgCha-1, and slightly increased from fringe toward interior forest. The 13,400ha of mangrove forests in the CMNP were estimated to store 10.3 (Â±0.8)Ã—106 Mg of C, which is equivalent to 38.0 (Â±3.0)Ã—106 Mg of CO2e. The present results suggest that the conservation of mangrove forest is needed to increase ecosystem C storage and to offset C emissions at the regional scale. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Saltmarsh sediments with wastewater input emit more carbon greenhouse gases but less N2O than mangrove sediments
AB  - Wastewater discharge and salt marsh invasion are two main disturbances in global mangrove wetland ecosystems, but their combined effects on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions remain unclear. Here, we performed a laboratory incubation experiment by adding wastewater (aquaculture and domestic wastewater) to mangrove and salt marsh sediments. Dissolved GHGs (CO2, CH4 and N2O) and environmental parameters were measured over a time series of 50 days. The nitrification and denitrification rates and corresponding functional gene abundances (AOA, AOB, nirS, and narG) were also quantified. The results show that wastewater addition significantly increased GHG emissions and global warming potential (GWP) in wetland sediments (p &lt; 0.05 for both). Compared with mangroves, salt marsh sediments produced more carbon GHGs (CO2 and CH4) but less N2O after wastewater input. These different stimulatory effects could be explained by the nitrogen and carbon substrate availability, organic matter quality, and functional gene abundances in sediments. Assessing GHG emissions as CO2 equivalents, future scenarios of increasing salt marsh invasion with wastewater addition would increase the GWP caused by CO2 and CH4, decrease blue carbon sequestration potential in wetlands, and decrease the GWP caused by N2O and total GWP, indicating a great impact on global climate change and important implications for managing coastal wetlands.

TI  - The Potential of Blue Carbon Stocks and Carbon Dioxide Absorption in Mangrove Forests to Support Low Carbon Emission Development in Southeast Sulawesi Province, Indonesia
AB  - Indonesia is a country with the second-longest coastline globally and has the most extensive mangrove forests in the world. Mangrove forests are included in the blue carbon group, which per hectare store up to four times more carbon storage than tropical forests. Mangrove forests play an essential role in absorbing carbon emissions in the air and storing a lot of carbon compared to natural forests. This study aims to determine carbon storage and CO2 absorption in mangrove forests in Kabaena Barat Subdistrict, Bombana Regency. The data comes from direct measurements in the field, namely above-ground carbon, carried out without damaging trees, only covering carbon in tree vegetation. It is the largest proportion of carbon storage on land. The data collection used a survey method to identify mangrove species, circumference, tree trunk diameter at breast height (dbh), biomass, carbon storage, CO2 absorption, and 22 plots of plotted line method with eight transects. The results showed that 10 types of mangrove species were found on the transect observation, namely Avicennia alba, Avicennia marina, Avicennia lanata, Avicennia sp., Bruguiera cylindrica, Bruguiera gymnorhiza, Rhizophora apiculata, Rhizophora mucronata, Sonneratia alba, and Xylocarpus granatum. With the total amount of biomass stored in Kabaena Barat Subdistrict's mangrove forests, Bombana Regency, is 6,664.93 tons ha-1 with carbon storage of 3,065.85 tons ha-1 and carbon dioxide absorption of 11,241.55 tons ha-1.

TI  - High greenhouse gas emissions mitigation benefits from mangrove rehabilitation in Sulawesi, Indonesia
AB  - Mangroves have generated considerable interest in forest carbon discourse given their disproportionately high carbon storage and sequestration potential compared to terrestrial habitats. Capitalising on this potential, however, remains largely unrealised due in part to an incomplete understanding of the full greenhouse gas mitigation benefits provided, particularly through changes in landuse where aquaculture ponds are converted back to mangroves. Here we address such uncertainties by estimating the overall net greenhouse offset potential from rehabilitating mangroves in Tiwoho, North Sulawesi (Indonesia). Estimates of both baseline emissions and sequestration as mangrove forests regrow after rehabilitation were assessed, with results contrasted against published data on established mangroves and terrestrial forest carbon projects registered with the Verified Carbon Standard. Additionally, net emissions removals and reductions from Tiwoho is scaled-up to the national level in order to estimate the contribution rehabilitation of disused ponds can make to climate change mitigation. We also monetarise potential returns generated to date and frame this against project implementation and opportunity costs. Our data indicates that, on average, Tiwoho's rehabilitating sites could potentially mitigate upwards of -27.6 +/- 1.7 Mg CO2-e per hectare per year. This is upwards of 3 times that of other terrestrial forestry carbon projects and, assuming a voluntary carbon market price of USD \$8.1 per Mg CO2-e per hectare for afforestation/reforestation projects, equates to recuperation of 76.2\% of initial project implementation costs over approximately 10 years with an annual return of 7.6\%. This return rate rivals that of most asset classes targeted by private sector investors. Scaling results to encompass the net emissions removals and reduction potential from rehabilitating the similar to 600, 000 hectares of disused ponds in Indonesia may offset upwards of -16.56 +/- 1.02 million Mg CO2-e per hectare per year. Additionally, mitigation benefits from rehabilitation may equate to 6 times that of terrestrial projects if situated in ponds displaying both high baseline emissions and high rates of re-growth whilst accounting for sequestration from benthic algae and the oceanic burial of dissolved inorganic carbon. These findings strengthen the evidence base needed for public and private sector support for mangrove rehabilitation within the forest carbon sector.

TI  - Increased Organic Carbon Burial in Northern Florida Mangrove-Salt Marsh Transition Zones
AB  - Blue carbon habitats like salt marshes and mangroves bury large amounts of carbon with limited area; however, they also are increasingly susceptible to current climate change. Combined effects of rising temperatures, decreasing freeze frequencies, and increasing sea level rise rates are resulting in mangrove replacement of salt marshes along the southern United States. Surface soils analyzed here from wetlands along northern Florida Atlantic and Gulf Coasts showed higher apparent sedimentation rates in mangrove-dominated sites (1.5-3.2 mm yr(-1)) and where mangroves are migrating into the marsh (termed transition sites, 2.3-3.8 mm yr(-1)). Average carbon burial rates were higher in transition sites for both coasts (27-47 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) compared to the respective mangrove (10-22 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) and salt marsh (4-7 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) sites. Lignin biomarker data (?-6, ?-8, and C/V) indicated that mangrove and transition sites had higher lignin inputs from woody vascular plants compared to salt marsh sites, which may slow decadal- to centennial-scale decay. Higher amino acid concentrations in mangrove soils relative to mangrove biomass (1.8-2.3 mmol g C-1 vs. 0.2-0.9 mmol g C-1) and lower C/N indicated that these mangrove sites receive higher algal inputs than the transition and salt marsh sites, attributed to greater tidal inundation in the mangrove sites given their position near the shoreline. Overall, increased accretion, carbon burial, and lignin in mangrove transition sites indicate that this migration may increase carbon burial and increase the stability and residence time of buried soil carbon. Future studies on mangrove migration in northern Florida can verify this through replication and elevation analysis.

TI  - The Evolution of Blue Carbon Science
AB  - `Blue carbon' was coined over a decade ago to describe the contribution of mangroves, seagrasses, and tidal marshes to carbon drawdown in coasts and oceans, concomitantly attracting attention of policy-makers and resource managers to their potential as a natural climate solution. Here, we explore the emergence and evolution of this relatively new research field through bibliometrics approaches to investigate patterns and trends in scientific publications through time. Our aim was to understand the evolution of blue carbon science, from where we came from and where we are now. We analysed 1,729 papers from 5,763 authors. Overall, the carbon-sink capacity of these ecosystems has been recognised long before the term `blue carbon' was coined; with an annual percentage growth rate of 20\% y(-1). Research attention was highest for mangroves (similar to 38\% of publications), followed by saltmarshes (similar to 22\%), and seagrasses (similar to 18\%); while similar to 16\% of the studies included two or more blue carbon ecosystems and 5\% of the studies focused on other ecosystems. The citation burst analysis showed that, in the 1990s, the hot topic (i.e., fast-growing topic) was related to the overall flux and dynamics of carbon, with a recent transition to the role of coastal vegetation to climate change mitigation from 2009. The term `blue carbon' became a hot topic in 2017, with the strongest citation burst between 2017 and 2020. This bibliometric study draws the patterns and trends of blue carbon science and indicate that this field is evolving through time to focus more on the blue carbon role as nature climate solutions.

TI  - The role of biogenic structures for greenhouse gas balance in vegetated intertidal wetlands
AB  - This chapter elucidates in detail the current knowledge on the role of biogenic structures for greenhouse gas biogeochemistry and dynamics in vegetated intertidal wetlands, i.e., mangrove forests and saltmarshes. The major types of biogenic structures formed by wetland plants and animals are portrayed and related to relevant biogeochemical processes affecting greenhouse gases. Subsequently, the impact of biogenic structures for greenhouse gas exchange is demonstrated by assessing and compiling the current knowledge on net primary production, carbon sequestration, and greenhouse gas emissions in mangrove forests and Spartina marshes. The data compilation clearly emphasizes the important role of biogenic structures (i.e., plant roots and infaunal burrows/tubes) for carbon cycling and greenhouse gas dynamics of intertidal wetlands. Emission of the greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, and N2O in mangrove forests with biogenic structures is increased 4.8, 29.9, and 3.8 times, respectively, compared with mangrove sediments devoid of these structures. Due to lack of reliable data on the role of burrow structures on greenhouse gas emission in Spartina marshes, only the impact of vegetation is available resulting in an increase of 2.7, 3.3, and 9.1 times, respectively. The strong enhancement of greenhouse gas emissions via biogenic structures largely counteracts the otherwise efficient capacity of carbon sequestration by these vegetated wetlands, leading to climate neutrality when embracing the global warming potential of the involved gases. This finding is surprising and contradicts previous estimates that indicated a distinct climate mitigation potential of mangrove and saltmarsh ecosystems. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - New Insights into the Microplastic Enrichment in the Blue Carbon Ecosystem: Evidence from Seagrass Meadows and Mangrove Forests in Coastal South China Sea
AB  - Microplastics were recently found to aggregate in the blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), which are known for their ability to store carbon by slowing down the water flow. However, evidence is largely lacking on how the accumulation of microplastics is related to carbon sequestration in BCEs and if this trap effect is driven by its biological characteristics. In this study, the trap effect of microplastics by BCEs was evaluated for various seagrasses (Zostera japonica, Halophila ovalis, and Halophila beccarii) and mangroves (Aegiceras corniculatum and Avicennia marina). Significant accumulation was found in the seagrass meadow dominated by H. beccarii and the mangrove forest dominated by A. marina, with microplastics enriched by 1.3 to 17.6 times compared to their corresponding unvegetated sites. The abundance of microplastics varied greatly from 17.68 +/- 8.10 to 611.75 +/- 81.52 particles per kg of dry sediment, with the highest abundance in A. marina mangrove sediments. A strong positive correlation was found between the abundance of microplastics and the particulate organic carbon content at all study sites (Pearson, R = 0.86, p < 0.01). Higher diversity of microplastic colors and size was found in the H. beccarii meadow, and higher diversity of shapes was found in the A. marina forest. Our results added new insights to the understanding of the mechanism of microplastic trapping by BCEs and coupled the behavior of microplastics with the organic carbon in the sediment.

TI  - Impacts of Climate and Nutrients on Carbon Sequestration Rate by Wetlands: A Meta-analysis
AB  - Global numerous wetlands are the most productive ecosystem and have high carbon sequestration potential to mitigate increasing CO(2)in the atmosphere. However, few are available on estimating average carbon sequestration rates by global wetlands (Carbon(sq)) at century timescale. In this article, Carbon(sq)data of 473 wetland soil/sediment cores from the literatures were collected in detail by the meta-analysis method. These cores were no more than 300 years old and spanned a latitudinal range from 33.6 degrees S to 69.7 degrees N. Globally, the average Carbon(sq)was 185.2 g/(m(2)center dot yr) regardless of wetland types. Carbon(sq)varied remarkably between wetland types and ranked as an order of salt marsh (247.7 g/(m(2)center dot yr)) > mangrove (229.8 g/(m(2)center dot yr)) > freshwater marsh (196.7 g/(m(2)center dot yr)) > peatland (76.9 g/(m(2)center dot yr)). Carbon(sq)was positively related to mean annual temperature (AMT) and annual precipitation (Pre). Nitrogen was the most common and primary factor controlling Carbon(sq)regardless of wetland types.

TI  - Biodegraders of Large Woody Debris Across a Tidal Gradient in an Indonesian Mangrove Ecosystem
AB  - There has been limited research on the breakdown, recycling, and flux of carbon from large woody detritus (LWD) in mangrove forests. The breakdown of LWD is caused by guilds of terrestrial and marine biodegrading organisms that degrade wood at a range of rates and efficiencies. Spatial variations in environmental factors within mangroves affect the distribution and community of biodegrading organisms, which, in turn, impacts carbon flow and sequestration. We reveal the role of biodegrading organisms in LWD breakdown and the environmental factors that influence the distribution of biodegrading guilds within a mangrove forest in South East Sulawesi that supports a diversity of mangrove species typical of Indonesian mangrove forests, which constitute 20% of Global mangrove cover. Within the high intertidal regions, terrestrial biodegradation processes dominated upon LWD. After 12 months exposure on the forest floor, experimental wooden panels in these areas remained unchanged in mass and condition. In the low intertidal region, marine wood-boring animals belonging to the family Teredinidae were the dominant biodegraders of LWD, and their activity reduces LWD volume and speeds up the loss of LWD volume. More than 50% of the experimental wooden panelsâ€™ weight in these areas was lost after 12 months exposure on the forest floor. Although different biodegrading guilds occupy the same LWD niche, their distribution throughout the mangrove forest is influenced by inundation time. The change of biodegrading guilds within LWD between the terrestrial and the marine organisms was distinct, creating a biodegradation boundary in a distance as narrow as 1 m on the mangrove forest floor. These results are important, as rising sea levels have crucial implications for biodegrading guilds. A full understanding of factors affecting the biodegradation processes of LWD in mangrove forests is critical to accurately assess mangrove carbon stores and the fate of mangrove derived carbon.

TI  - Variability and Vulnerability of Coastal â€˜Blue Carbonâ€™ Stocks: A Case Study from Southeast Australia
AB  - â€˜Blue carbonâ€™ ecosystemsâ€”seagrasses, tidal marshes, and mangrovesâ€”serve as dense carbon sinks important for reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, yet only recently have stock estimates emerged. We sampled 96 blue carbon ecosystems across the Victorian coastline (southeast Australia) to quantify total sediment stocks, variability across spatial scales, and estimate emissions associated with historical ecosystem loss. Mean sediment organic carbon (Corg) stock (Â±SE) to a depth of 30Â cm was not significantly different between tidal marshes (87.1Â Â±Â 4.90Â Mg Corg haâˆ’1) and mangroves (65.6Â Â±Â 4.17Â Mg Corg haâˆ’1), but was significantly lower in seagrasses (24.3Â Â±Â 1.82Â Mg Corg haâˆ’1). Location (defined as an individual meadow, marsh, or forest) had a stronger relationship with Corg stock than catchment region, suggesting local-scale conditions drive variability of stocks more than regional-scale processes. We estimate over 2.90 millionÂ Â±Â 199,000Â Mg Corg in the top 30Â cm of blue carbon sediments in Victoria (53% in tidal marshes, 36% in seagrasses, and 11% in mangroves) and sequestration rates of 22,700Â Â±Â 5510Â Mg Corg yearâˆ’1 (valued at over $AUD1 millionÂ Â±Â 245,000 yearâˆ’1 based on the average price of AUD12.14Â Mg CO2 eqâˆ’1 at Australian Emissions Reduction Fund auctions). We estimate ecosystem loss since European settlement may equate to emissions as high as 4.83 millionÂ Â±Â 358,000Â Mg CO2 equivalents (assuming 90% remineralization of stocks), 98% of which was associated with tidal marsh loss, and what would have been sequestering 9360Â Â±Â 2500Â Mg Corg yearâˆ’1. This study is among the first to present a comprehensive comparison of sediment stocks across and within coastal blue carbon ecosystems. We estimate substantial and valuable carbon stocks associated with these ecosystems that have suffered considerable losses in the past and need protection into the future to maintain their role as carbon sinks.

TI  - Blue carbon dynamics in mangroves and conservation of their services in the Coral Triangle Ecoregion, Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia
AB  - Coral triangle eco-region is hotspot of coastal blue carbon, and contributes to the global carbon cycling. This study aimed to elucidate the blue carbon dynamics in mangroves and their importance services as source of blue carbon in the coastal zone of coral triangle ecoregion. The blue carbon content in mangrove sediment was analyzed, while blue carbon production and its export frommangroves leaf litterfallwasestimated. The results showed that the blue carbon content in mangrove sediment was significantly higher in deep of 40-50 cm than other layers(P< 0.05). The annual blue carbon production (g C/m2/year) was 495.80 for R. mucronata, 572.52 for C. tagal and 335.56 for R. apiculata. Moreover, the annual blue carbon exported g C/m2/year was 148.74 for R. mucronata, 171.76 for C. tagal and 100.68 R. apiculata. Overallcarbon production and carbon export from these mangrove species were 1403.88 and 421.18g C/m2/year, respectively.Therefore, huge blue carbon production and export by mangroves in this region contribute to the global carbon cycling in the coastal and marine environments. Thus, conservation of mangroves and their services is very important for maintenance the coastal productivity in the coral triangle eco-region. Â© 2021 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Variation in Seagrass Carbon Stocks Between Tropical Estuarine and Marine Mangrove-Fringed Creeks
AB  - Seagrass and associated blue carbon ecosystems are important carbon sinks, and hence understanding their spatial and temporal variability is vital in appreciating their potential roles in climate change mitigation and adaptation. The Indo-Pacific region has the highest seagrass biodiversity, yet little focus has been made to compare seagrass habitat extent and carbon dynamics with their temperate counterparts. The present study assessed habitat characteristics and seagrass species distribution, diversity, and carbon storage in Eastern (marine) and Western (estuarine) mangrove-fringed creeks of Gazi Bay, Kenya. Data on species composition, canopy cover, biomass, and sediment organic carbon were collected in 80 plots of 0.25 x 0.25 m laid along transects established perpendicular to the waterline. Five species formation, viz., Thalassia hemprichii, Cymodocea rotundata, Cymodocea serrulata, Enhalus acoroides, and Thalassidendron ciliatum, were encountered as either single or mixed stands. There was a significant difference in total seagrass biomass between creeks (p < 0.01), with the Eastern creek recording a mean of 10.2 +/- 0.6 Mg C ha(-1) while the Western creek recording 4.3 +/- 0.3 Mg C ha(-1). In addition, sediment carbon to 1-m depth varied significantly (p < 0.01) between species in the two creeks and ranged from 98 to 302 Mg C ha(-1), with the Eastern and Western creeks recording means of 258 +/- 90 and 107 +/- 21 Mg C ha(-1), respectively. The total carbon stock from 50 ha of seagrasses in the Eastern creek was 13,420 Mg C, whereas in the 70 ha of the Western creek it was 7,769 Mg C. The study shows that seagrass community attributes such as species composition and productivity can vary dramatically over a small spatial extent due to differences in biophysical conditions and caution estimations of site-specific carbon stocks using generalized global values.

TI  - Valuing blue carbon: Carbon sequestration benefits provided by the marine protected areas in Colombia
AB  - Marine protected areas are aimed to protect and conserve key ecosystems for the provision of a number of ecosystem services that are the basis for numerous economic activities. Among the several services that these areas provide, the capacity of sequestering (capturing and storing) organic carbon is a regulating service, provided mainly by mangroves and seagrasses, that gains importance as alternatives for mitigating global warming become a priority in the international agenda. The objective of this study is to value the services associated with the capture and storage of oceanic carbon, known as Blue Carbon, provided by a new network of marine protected areas in Colombia. We approach the monetary value associated to these services through the simulation of a hypothetical market for oceanic carbon. To do that, we construct a benefit function that considers the capacity of mangroves and seagrasses for capturing and storing blue carbon, and simulate scenarios for the variation of key variables such as the market carbon price, the discount rate, the natural rate of loss of the ecosystems, and the expectations about the post-Kyoto negotiations. The results indicate that the expected benefits associated to carbon capture and storage provided by these ecosystems are substantial but highly dependent on the expectations in terms of the negotiations surrounding the extension of the Kyoto Protocol and the dynamics of the carbon credit's demand and supply. We also find that the natural loss rate of these ecosystems does not seem to have a significant effect on the annual value of the benefits. This approach constitutes one of the first attempts to value blue carbon as one of the services provided by conservation. Â© 2015 Zarate-Barrera, Maldonado.

TI  - Species Diversity, Biomass, and Carbon Stock Assessments of Mangrove Forest in Labuhan, Indonesia
AB  - Mangroves provide numerous ecosystem services, including fisheries production, nutrient cycling, soil formation and carbon storage. However, the forests and their habitat have degraded rapidly due to anthropogenic threats. Consequently, the loss of carbon (C) stored in these ecosystem is inevitable. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the species diversity of mangrove forest of Labuhan, Lamongan regency, Indonesia and evaluate its above-ground and below-ground-root biomass and C. Twenty-four plots with a size of 10x10 m were carried out using the quadrat sampling technique to identify, record and measure the DBH of the trees. The Shannon - Wiener's diversity index (H'=1.51) was moderate, having a total of nine true mangrove forests dominated by Rhizophora mucronata and Rhizophora apiculata with an importance value index of 100.40\% and 80.46\% respectively. The total C stored in above-ground and below-ground-root was 74.70 +/- 15.58 Mg C ha(-1), which is equivalent to total CO2 sequestration of 274.15 +/- 57.18 Mg CO2 ha(-1). This study suggests that the Labuhan mangrove forest has a potential to store and sequester a substantial amount of atmospheric C; therefore, it is needed to protect and sustainably manage this important forest.

TI  - The Carbon Sink of Mangrove Ecological Restoration between 1988â€“2020 in Qinglan Bay, Hainan Island, China
AB  - As the worldâ€™s largest reactive carbon reservoir, the ocean plays a critical role in global climate change. Among coastal plant ecosystems, mangroves have the highest carbon storage efficiency and are prone to the impact of anthropogenic activities. In this study, taking the mangrove wetland of Qinglan Bay as an example, we extracted information on mangrove coastal surface change from 1988 to 2020 based on multi-temporal Landsat remote sensing data through field ground surveys and laboratory analysis and used the InVEST model to calculate the spatial and temporal structure of blue carbon in the mangrove area to investigate the effects of mangrove change in an ecological restoration context. The result shows that the overall area of mangrove forests exhibited a decreasing trend from 1988 to 2020, and the area of mangroves decreased from 1559.34 ha to 737.37 ha of which 52.71% was transformed into aquiculture, construction, and farm land. Accordingly, the mangrove carbon sinks from 1988 to 2020 were significantly reduced and the carbon stock decreased at an annual tendency from 1,025,901.71 tons to 712,118.69 tons. With the implementation of mangrove restoration, the decline of mangrove forests has decreased since 2003, promoting the stabilization and enhancement of carbon sinks in the mangrove wetlands of Qinglan Bay. The results of this study provide a technical method to evaluate the carbon sink contribution of mangrove wetland restoration in Hainan Province, a scientific basis and methodological innovation to monitor the carbon sink of mangrove cover change in larger regions of China, a theoretical basis to select criteria for mangrove restoration, and a scientific and systematic management strategy for ecological and mangrove restoration on Hainan Island.

TI  - Carbon Stocks in the Small Estuarine Mangroves of Geza and Mtimbwani, Tanga, Tanzania
AB  - Mangrove forests offer important ecosystem services, including their high capacity for carbon sequestration and stocking. However, they face rapid degradation and loss of ecological resilience particularly at local scales due to human pressure. We conducted inventory of mangrove forests to characterise forest stand structure and estimate carbon stocks in the small estuarine mangroves of Geza and Mtimbwani in Tanga, Tanzania. Forest structure, above-ground carbon (AGC), and below-ground carbon (BGC) were characterised. Soil carbon was estimated to 1 m depth using loss on ignition procedure. Six common mangrove species were identified dominated by Avicennia marina (Forsk.) Vierh. and Rhizophora mucronata Lamarck. Forest stand density and basal area were 1740 stems ha-1 and 17.2 m2 ha-1 for Geza and 2334 stems ha-1 and 30.3 m2 ha-1 for Mtimbwani. Total ecosystem carbon stocks were 414.6 Mg C ha-1 for Geza and 684.9 Mg C ha-1 for Mtimbwani. Soil carbon contributed over 65% of these stocks, decreasing with depth. Mid zones of the mangrove stands had highest carbon stocks. These data demonstrate that studied mangroves are potential for carbon projects and provide the baseline for monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) to support the projects.

TI  - The effect of heterogeneous soil bulk density on root growth of field-grown mangrove species
AB  - Background and aimsMangroves harbour large organic carbon (C) reservoirs in their soils that are important in the global C cycle. The below-ground biomass of mangrove trees is a major contributor to these organic C stocks. Root system development tends to be highly plastic in response to environmental conditions such as soil bulk density (BD). Hence, this study aimed to assess the role of soil BD on mangrove root growth.MethodsRoot in-growth bags filled with root-free soil ranging in BD from 0.2 to 1.2gcm(-3) were buried in the soil of three mangrove species.ResultsRoot image analysis indicated that BD had a significant positive effect on root length and root biomass suggesting trees increase biomass allocation to roots and enhance root elongation, possibly to increase the acquisition of water and nutrients in dense soils. However, the responses to variation in BD were species-specific which was attributed to differences in species growth rates and the background soil conditions.ConclusionSoil BD affects mangrove root growth with dense patches likely to have increased root growth and organic C sequestration potential compared to less dense soil patches.

TI  - Interspecific variations in mangrove stem biomass: A potential storehouse of sequestered carbon
AB  - Variations in stem biomass and carbon density in 12 mangrove species were studied to understand the potential of carbon storage in the live biomass of Bhitarkanika mangrove ecosystems, South-East Coast of India. The results highlighted significant inter-species variations (p&lt;0.01; ANOVA) in the stem wood density and carbon content and could be attributed to the spatial variations in soil fertility, adaptation, freshwater supply, genus identity as well as properties of the fibre lumen and wall. Among the studied species, Avicennia officinalis showed the highest carbon density and Corg/Ntot ratios followed by Heritiera fomes. Further, the higher carbon sequestration capacity of these two mangrove species was confirmed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Corg, Corg/Ntot and cellulose/protein ratio were strongly associated with the wood density of the studied mangrove species. Mangrove stem diameter (at breast height; DBH), wood density and tree height were used to estimate the above-ground biomass of all the species, which showed remarkably higher biomass for Avicennia officinalis. Possible adaptation of these species under extreme environmental conditions in addition to variations in vessel wall thickness caused by differential carbon fixation and storage in the form of biomass could explain the variability in elemental properties of mangrove stem wood. Heritiera littoralis and Kandelia candel with relatively higher lignin to cellulose content showed greater potentials to sustain biotic and abiotic stresses and indicated higher carbon sequestration as recalcitrant biomass. The lowest carbon density and highest ratio of cellulose/lignin in the Sonneratia apetala and Sonneratia caseolaris species indicated faster plant growth compared to the other studied species. FTIR analysis evidenced that the increase in the 1728â€“1733 cm âˆ’1 band height assigned to cellulose and decrease in the 1517â€“1519 cm âˆ’1 band height assigned to lignin. Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Coastal soil texture controls soil organic carbon distribution and storage of mangroves in China
AB  - Mangroves are among the most carbon-rich forests in the tropics, but the spatial variation in soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and the mechanisms controlling their stability remain contentious. Here, we proposed a new framework based on distinct coastal soil textures (muddy, sandy, and mud-sand mixed soil) and found that coastal soil texture exhibits regional-scale variations in mangrove soil C:N:P stoichiometry and SOC storage. Using this soil texture classification framework, we identified the important role of mud-sand mixed soil, which functions as a blue carbon hotspot in coastal wetlands. We showed that mangrove SOC storage was underestimated by approximately 37\% in mud-sand mixed soil and overestimated by approximately 54\% in muddy soil. We further revealed that the chemical composition of SOC and clay mineralogy are responsible for SOC stability by combining physical and chemical characterizations. As a microbial-derived C, glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) contained higher alkyl C (similar to 58\%) and lower O-alkyl C (similar to 17\%) than mangrove soils, indicating that GRSP contributes to the stable SOC pool by its recalcitrant structure. We further found that the C:N:P stoichiometric signature of GRSP can capture variations in mangrove SOC storage compatible with distinct coastal soil textures. These results highlight the role of GRSP in regulating SOC stabilization mechanisms, potentially attenuating coastal blue carbon-climate feedback. Regional-scale variation in SOC linked to coastal soil textures can provide more robust estimates of the contribution of mangrove SOC to global C dynamics.

TI  - Significant Organic Carbon Accumulation in Two Coastal Acid Sulfate Soil Wetlands
AB  - Restoring degraded freshwater wetlands may help to maximize soil carbon sequestration. In this study, we use 18 Pb-210-dated sediment cores to determine the organic carbon (OC) accumulation rates from two hydrologically restored freshwater coastal acid sulfate soil (CASS) wetlands. Recent OC accumulation rates (from similar to 1980 to present) were estimated to be 251 +/- 26 g.m(-2).year(-1) in the seasonally inundated CASS and 227 +/- 50 g.m(-2).year(-1) in the permanently inundated CASS. The average OC accumulation during the previous century (190 +/- 20 g.m(-2).year(-1)) was within the range of blue carbon ecosystems (saltmarshes, mangroves, and seagrasses). Considering their large area and carbon accumulation rate, we estimate that Australian CASS wetlands sequester approximately 7.8 +/- 0.8 Tg of carbon annually, which is equivalent to similar to 8\% of the CO2 emission from fossil fuels in Australia. Hence, preserving or restoring CASS may be a good climate change mitigation strategy. Plain Language Summary Coastal freshwater wetlands are highly productive and can sequester large amounts of carbon. The carbon accumulation rates here suggest that coastal acid sulfate soils (CASS) are also a substantial sink of CO2. By extrapolating our observations, we show that approximately 7.79 Tg of carbon is sequestered in Australian CASS wetlands annually which is equivalent to similar to 8\% of the CO2 emission from fossil fuels in Australia. Hence, managing CASS wetlands to protect their soil carbon store function may help offset anthropogenic sources of greenhouse gasses and their hydrological remediation could be an important component to the global carbon cycle.

TI  - Solutions to blue carbon emissions: Shrimp cultivation, mangrove deforestation and climate change in coastal Bangladesh
AB  - In Bangladesh, export-oriented shrimp farming is one of the most important sectors of the national economy. However, shrimp farming in coastal Bangladesh has devastating effects on mangrove forests. Mangroves are the most carbon-rich forests in the tropics, and blue carbon (i.e., carbon in coastal and marine ecosystems) emissions from mangrove deforestation due to shrimp cultivation are accumulating. These anthropogenic carbon emissions are the dominant cause of climate change, which in turn affect shrimp cultivation. Some adaptation strategies including Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA), mangrove restoration, and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD +) could help to reduce blue carbon emissions. Translocation of shrimp culture from mangroves to open-water IMTA and restoration of habitats could reduce blue carbon emissions, which in turn would increase blue carbon sequestration. Mangrove restoration by the REDD + program also has the potential to conserve mangroves for resilience to climate change. However, institutional support is needed to implement the proposed adaptation strategies.

AB  - The conservation of mangroves and other coastal ``blue carbon{'' ecosystems is receiving heightened attention because of recognition of their high ecosystem carbon stocks as well as vast areas undergoing land conversion. However, few studies have paired intact mangroves with degraded sites to determine carbon losses due to land conversion. To address this gap we quantified total ecosystem carbon stocks in mangroves and cattle pastures formed from mangroves in the large wetland complex of the Pantanos de Centla in SE Mexico. The mean total ecosystem carbon stocks of fringe and estuarine tall mangroves was 1358 Mg C/ha. In contrast the mean carbon stocks of cattle pastures was 458 Mg C/ha. Based upon a biomass equivalence of losses from the top 1 m of mangrove soils, the losses in carbon stocks from mangrove conversion are conservatively estimated at 1464 Mg CO(2)e/ha. These losses were 7-fold that of emissions from tropical dry forest to pasture conversion and 3-fold greater than emissions from Amazon forest to pasture conversion. However, we found that limiting ecosystem carbon stocks differences to the surface 1 m or even 2 m soil depth will miss losses that occurred from deeper horizons. Mangrove conversion to other land uses comes at a great cost in terms of greenhouse gas emissions as well losses of other important ecosystem services.

TI  - Locally assessing the economic viability of blue carbon: A case study from Panay Island, the Philippines
AB  - Previous blue carbon studies have focused on discrete carbon stock assessments and overarching systematic reviews which broadly speculate that it may be economically viable to incorporate mangroves into existing carbon finance platforms. There is a discernible need to test this hypothesis through case specific investigations that determine this presumed viability in a local or regional context - at scales meaningful for policy development. The current study investigates whether the carbon values of mangrove forests on Panay Island, the Philippines, are sufficient to offset the opportunity costs of milkfish (Charms charms) aquaculture - the primary cause of mangrove deforestation in the Philippines. Profit margins associated with milldish aquaculture are calculated through a municipality wide survey (779 +/- 140 US\$ ha(-1) yr(-1)). Concurrently, the carbon stocks of two heterogeneous mangrove forests are quantified and compared. Creditable CO2 emissions reductions are modelled under a broad range of assumptions. These emissions are valorised, and a sensitivity analysis is performed to establish the minimum price at which opportunity costs are offset across a range of methodological and accounting preferences. It is determined that carbon prices of around 5-12 US\$ LCO(2)e(-1) would be required to compensate landowners for their lost aquaculture profits. The implications of our findings are discussed.

TI  - Contributions of mangrove conservation and restoration to climate change mitigation in Indonesia
AB  - Mangrove forests are important carbon sinks, and this is especially true for Indonesia where about 24\% of the world's mangroves exist. Unfortunately, vast expanses of these mangroves have been deforested, degraded or converted to other uses resulting in significant greenhouse gas emissions. The objective of this study was to quantify the climate change mitigation potential of mangrove conservation and restoration in Indonesia. We calculated the emission factors from the dominant land uses in mangroves, determined mangrove deforestation rates and quantified the total emissions and the potential emission reductions that could be achieved from mangrove conservation and restoration. Based on our analysis of the carbon stocks and emissions from land use in mangroves we found: (1) Indonesia's mangrove ecosystem carbon stocks are among the highest of any tropical forest type; (2) mangrove deforestation results in greenhouse gas emissions that far exceed that of upland tropical deforestation; (3) in the last decade the rates of deforestation in Indonesian mangroves have remained high; and (4) conservation and restoration of mangroves promise to sequester significant quantities of carbon. While mangroves comprise only approximate to 2.6\% of Indonesia's total forest area, their degradation and deforestation accounted for approximate to 10\% of total greenhouse gas emissions arising from the forestry sector. The large source of greenhouse gas emissions from a relatively small proportion of the forest area underscores the value for inclusion of mangroves as a natural climate solution. Mangrove conservation is far more effective than mangrove restoration in carbon emissions reductions and an efficient pathway to achieve Indonesia's nationally determined contribution (NDC) targets. The potential emission reduction from halting deforestation of primary and secondary mangroves coupled with restoration activities could result in an emission reduction equivalent to 8\% of Indonesia's 2030 NDC emission reduction targets from the forestry sector.

TI  - Application of Stranded Pelagic Sargassum Biomass as Compost for Seedling Production in the Context of Mangrove Restoration
AB  - The Sargassum spp. inundations across the Atlantic and Caribbean that began in 2011 have continued unabated, and new uses for the biomass are being continuously explored. Mangroves protect shorelines, store carbon, enhance water quality, and promote biodiversity. Their restoration can be hindered by poor soils associated with urbanized coastlines. Sargassum spp. application in the form of mulch, compost, and plant tonics has yielded positive results in a range of plants. As part of transforming the inundations to benefit communities, Sargassum spp. compost (SC) was assessed in mangrove seedling production for restoration. Pure SC was mixed with soil/sand medium, as different treatments, for the production of Rhizophora mangle seedlings in ``wet{''} and ``dry{''} nurseries. Plants in the ``wet{''} nursery performed poorly, with 90-100\% of plants in 50 and 100\% SC, respectively, dying after 6 weeks. Seedlings in all SC treatments in the ``dry{''} nursery survived with obvious and statistically significant treatment differences. Height and number of leaves indicated the best growth in the 75\% SC treatment, while the control (0\% SC) had the poorest growth. Seedling health, greatest in the control, was poorest in 50 and 100\% SC. Elemental analysis of SC, seedlings, and soil/sand medium indicated that several elements (Na, K, Ca, As, and Se) found in high concentrations in the SC were low in the plants. Overall, low sequestration of elements by mangrove seedlings and the reported ability of mangrove soils to reduce element mobilization through chelation indicate the potential use of Sargassum spp. in soil amelioration for mangrove restoration without proportional contamination of the ecosystem. We see the potential use of nuisance Sargassum spp. blooms to support mangrove restoration, leading to increased benefits to coastal communities being affected by the inundations.

TI  - Ecophysiological and growth characters of ten woody plant species in determining their carbon sequestration
AB  - Tree planting and ecosystem restoration is one of mitigation program of global climate change scheme to reduce CO2in the atmosphere by sequestering carbon. Carbon storage in the living plant varies among species due to ecophysiological and growth characters of their photosynthesis. Ecophysiological properties of tropical plant species related to carbon sequestration was lack of investigation. The study in this area will be the significant knowledge contribution to C-sink project especially species-level management which has been agreed globally and nationally. The objectives of this research were to study the ecophysiological and growth factors affecting carbon sequestration and to select plant species with high carbon sequestration using 16 months-old-seedling of ten woody plant species. Biomass, carbon storage, the whole plant photosynthetic capacity, total chlorophyll content, stomatal index, and Leaf Area Index (LAI) were significantly different among species. The LAI, total chlorophyll content, whole plant photosynthetic capacity, stem height and stem diameter were positively correlated to biomass and carbon storage. Multivariate correlation test (P&gt;0.05) revealed that the total of chlorophyll content was the ecophysiological factor most contributes to carbon sequestration. The total of chlorophyll content correlates to the stem height, while the whole plant photosynthesis correlates to leaf area in determining plant carbon sequestration. Moreover, two mangrove species, H. littoralis and B. asiatica have the highest carbon sequestration among species studied. For priority in tree planting program in dry lowland habitats, the local species, i.e., S. cumini and D. discolor were more recommended than any others species observed in this study.

TI  - The first report of Glomalin from the Sundarban Mangrove Biosphere Reserve, India, a long-term sediment Carbon storage
AB  - Seasonal and vertical profile of Glomalin Related Soil Protein (GRSP) from Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi showed an explanatory outcome related to the carbon sequestration processes in the sediment of the Sundarban Mangrove biosphere reserve. A decreasing trend was found for total GRSP (T-GRSP) and easily extractable GRSP (EE-GRSP) with increase in depth whereas a reverse profile was found for difficulty extractable GRSP (DE-GRSP) in the deep forest region. Accumulation of Glomalin during post-monsoon found to be 1.43 times and 1.41 times higher than that of pre-monsoon and monsoon season, respectively. A significant impact of soil redox potential on the accumulation of difficulty extractable GRSP (DE-GRSP) indicated possible acceleration in Glomalin synthesis and subsequent carbon sequestration under enhanced sediment anoxicity in this biosphere reserve. Sediment salinity, temperature and pH did not show any significant cause on the occurrence of Glomalin related soil proteins, indicating its limited dependence on these environmental parameters. A direct correlation was perceptible between the number of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal spores with T-GRSP, EE-GRSP and DE-GRSP in the sediment during the study period from 2012 to 2014. Organic carbon showed a strong positive correlation with Glomalin related soil protein T-GRSP (mg g(-1) dry wt of sediment) = 3.06 Organic Carbon (\%)+ 0.13; R-2 =0.95], indicating a significant fraction of organic carbon is converted to GRSP as long-term carbon storage by Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi present in the sediment of this unique biosphere reserve.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration of Dwarf Red Mangrove in The Bahamas
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are being lost globally at an alarming rate due to deforestation, reclamation, and urbanization. Not only is the loss of these ecosystems detrimental to the commercially and ecologically important marine species they support, there is also a reduction in the ecosystem services they provide, namely mitigating rising carbon dioxide levels by serving as carbon sinks. These ecosystems, labeled as ``blue carbon{''} sinks, potentially sequester more than 10 times the carbon that tropical and temperate ecosystems do. Thus, conservation and restoration of these blue carbon sinks is imperative. We explored how much carbon is currently stored in dwarf red mangrove Rhizophora mangle biomass in tidal creeks of Eleuthera, Bahamas. In October of 2012, four sites were selected near Cape Eleuthera, maximizing site variability All sampling was done from six plots established at each site. The quantity of carbon stored in mangroves was determined from plant biomass, which was extrapolated from plant volumes. Mangrove volumes were determined from growth parameters of individuals. It was observed that there were large differences from site to site in number of individuals, sediment depth, biomass accumulation, and carbon allocation of mangroves, but the total amount of carbon stored from site to site in mangroves did not differ. The site with the greatest biomass and carbon storage also had the greatest sediment depth, suggesting a correlation between the two. Regardless of the site to site variability, mangroves proved to be good stores for carbon. Future work should search for the factors that explain site to site variability.

TI  - Cost-benefit analysis of `Blue Carbon' sequestration by plantation of few key mangrove species at Sundarban Biosphere Reserve, India
AB  - Climate change and global warming have a destabilizing effect on the global environment, and governmental statutory bodies are emphasizing a reduction of emission coupled with restoration of degraded forest lands as a carbon sequestration-emission reduction (REDD+) initiative. Asphyxiated mangrove soil, existing on the borderline of land and sea, has the highest potential to trap `blue carbon'; hence, plantation programs have been initiated around the tropical coasts to restore this unique habitat. This case study provides a cost-benefit and carbon sequestration analysis for planting of five mangrove species (Avicennia marina, Bruguiera sexangula, Ceriops tagal, Rhizophora mucronata and Xylocarpus moluccensis) by various methods in a 102.4-ha area at the Indian Sundarbans. It is estimated that as per the planting methods used in the current study and physio-chemical properties of the sediment, coupled with other local factors such as anthropogenic interventions, Avicennia marina planting by the `propagule dibbling' method is the most cost effective (0.002 Euro/survived plant), with the highest increment (97\%) in organic carbon density (OCD), humic acid (100.86\%) and fulvic acid (48.78\%) over a period of 5 years. Survival rate was highest (82\%) for Avicennia marina, planted by the `transplanting of nursery-grown seedlings' method. The drain and trench method resulted in a 55\% survival rate for Rhizophora mucronata, but the extra labor investment made this the costliest method (0.13 Euro/survived plant) and also less carbon effective (only 85\% increment of OCD in 5 years). Planting methods, sediment quality, tidal inundation and salinity variations can play a major role in blue carbon burial/sequestration in mangrove lands.

TI  - The Contribution of Subtidal Seagrass Meadows to the Total Carbon Stocks of Gazi Bay, Kenya
AB  - Seagrass beds occur globally in both intertidal and subtidal zones within shallow marine environments, such as bays and estuaries. These important ecosystems support fisheries production, attenuate strong wave energies, support human livelihoods and sequester large amounts of CO2 that may help mitigate the effects of climate change. At present, there is increased global interest in understanding how these ecosystems could help alleviate the challenges likely to face humanity and the environment into the future. Unlike other blue carbon ecosystems, i.e., mangroves and saltmarshes, seagrasses are less understood, especially regarding their contribution to the carbon dynamics. This is particularly true in regions with less attention and limited resources. Paucity of information is even more relevant for the subtidal meadows that are less accessible. In Kenya, much of the available information on seagrasses comes from Gazi Bay, where the focus has been on the extensive intertidal meadows. As is the case with other regions, there remains a paucity of information on subtidal meadows. This limits our understanding of the overall contribution of seagrasses in carbon capture and storage. This study provides the first assessment of the species composition and variation in carbon storage capacity of subtidal seagrass meadows within Gazi Bay. Nine seagrass species, comprising of Cymodocea rotundata, Cymodocea serrulata, Enhalus acoroides, Halodule uninervis, Halophila ovalis, Halophila stipulacea, Syringodium isoetifolium, Thalassia hemprichii, and Thalassodendron ciliatum, were found. Organic carbon stocks varied between species and pools, with the mean below ground vegetation carbon (bgc) stocks (5.1 +/- 0.7 Mg C ha(-1)) being more than three times greater than above ground carbon (agc) stocks (0.5 +/- 0.1 Mg C ha(-1)). Mean sediment organic carbon stock (sed C-org) of the subtidal seagrass beds was 113 +/- 8 Mg C ha(-1). Combining this new knowledge with existing data from the intertidal and mangrove fringed areas, we estimate the total seagrass ecosystem organic carbon stocks in the bay to be 196,721 Mg C, with the intertidal seagrasses storing about 119,790 Mg C (61\%), followed by the subtidal seagrasses 55,742 Mg C (28\%) and seagrasses in the mangrove fringed creeks storing 21,189 Mg C (11\%). These findings are important in highlighting the need to protect subtidal seagrass meadows and for building a national and global data base on seagrass contribution to global carbon dynamics.

TI  - Blue carbon stock in sediments of mangroves and seagrass ecosystems at Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia
AB  - Coastal ecosystems store approximately 80% of carbon in sediments, which could be emitted due to degradation and deforestation. Therefore, protecting and managing these ecosystems are crucial for climate change mitigation. This study aims to determine sediment bulk density (SBD), sediment organic carbon (SOC) concentration, and sediment carbon stocks (SCS) in mangroves and seagrasses, and to elucidate how the protection scheme impacts them. We collected four sediment cores of 100 cm each from protected and unprotected mangrove areas and three sediment cores of 80 cm each from unprotected and protected seagrass areas. The average SBD in mangroves was 0.48 g cmâˆ’3 in protected areas and 0.55 g cmâˆ’3 in unprotected areas, while the average SBD in seagrass was 0.79 g cmâˆ’3 in protected areas and 0.85 g cmâˆ’3 in unprotected areas. The average SOC in mangroves was 8.65% in protected areas and 8.63% in unprotected areas, while the average SOC in seagrass was 5.89% and 6.25% in protected and unprotected areas, respectively. The average SCS in the protected area was 381 and 363 Mg C haâˆ’1 in the mangrove and seagrass ecosystems, respectively. On the other hand, the average SCS in the unprotected areas was 449 and 422 Mg C haâˆ’1 in mangroves and seagrass ecosystems, respectively. Although we did not find any significant differences in SCS between protected and unprotected ecosystems regardless of ecosystem types, the conservation management of blue carbon ecosystems is still needed to avoid future carbon emissions.

TI  - Tree above-ground biomass allometries for carbon stocks estimation in the Caribbean mangroves in Colombia [Ecuaciones alomÃ©tricas de biomasa aÃ©rea para la estimaciÃ³n de los contenidos de carbono en manglares del Caribe Colombiano]
AB  - The distribution of carbon in "Blue Carbon" ecosystems such as mangroves is little known, when compared with the highly known terrestrial forests, despite its particular and recognized high productivity and carbon storage capacity. The objective of this study was to analyze the above ground biomass (AGB) of the species Rhizophora mangle and Avicennia germinans from the Marine Protected Area of Distrito de Manejo Integrado (DMI), CispatÃ¡-Tinajones-La Balsa, Caribbean Colombian coast. With official authorization, we harvested and studied 30 individuals of each species, and built allometric models in order to estimate AGB. Our AGB results indicated that the studied mangrove forests of the DMI Colombian Caribbean was of 129.69 Â± 20.24 Mg/ha, equivalent to 64.85 Â± 10.12 MgC/ha. The DMI has an area of 8 570.9 ha in mangrove forests, and we estimated that the total carbon potential stored was about 555 795.93 Mg C. The equations generated in this study can be considered as an alternative for the assessment of carbon stocks in AGB of mangrove forests in Colombia; as other available AGB allometric models do not discriminate mangrove forests, despite being particular ecosystems. They can be used for analysis at a more detailed scale and are considered useful to determine the carbon storage potential of mangrove forests, as a country alternative to support forest conservation and emission reduction strategies. In general, the potential of carbon storage from Colombian Caribbean mangrove forests is important and could promote the country leadership of the "blue carbon" stored.

TI  - A global map of mangrove forest soil carbon at 30 m spatial resolution
AB  - With the growing recognition that effective action on climate change will require a combination of emissions reductions and carbon sequestration, protecting, enhancing and restoring natural carbon sinks have become political priorities. Mangrove forests are considered some of the most carbon-dense ecosystems in the world with most of the carbon stored in the soil. In order for mangrove forests to be included in climate mitigation efforts, knowledge of the spatial distribution of mangrove soil carbon stocks are critical. Current global estimates do not capture enough of the finer scale variability that would be required to inform local decisions on siting protection and restoration projects. To close this knowledge gap, we have compiled a large georeferenced database of mangrove soil carbon measurements and developed a novel machine-learning based statistical model of the distribution of carbon density using spatially comprehensive data at a 30 m resolution. This model, which included a prior estimate of soil carbon from the global SoilGrids 250 m model, was able to capture 63% of the vertical and horizontal variability in soil organic carbon density (RMSE of 10.9 kg m-3). Of the local variables, total suspended sediment load and Landsat imagery were the most important variable explaining soil carbon density. Projecting this model across the global mangrove forest distribution for the year 2000 yielded an estimate of 6.4 Pg C for the top meter of soil with an 86-729 Mg C ha-1 range across all pixels. By utilizing remotely-sensed mangrove forest cover change data, loss of soil carbon due to mangrove habitat loss between 2000 and 2015 was 30-122 Tg C with &gt;75% of this loss attributable to Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar. The resulting map products from this work are intended to serve nations seeking to include mangrove habitats in payment-for- ecosystem services projects and in designing effective mangrove conservation strategies.

TI  - Thirty-Year Repeat Measures of Mangrove Above- and Below-Ground Biomass Reveals Unexpectedly High Carbon Sequestration
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems store large quantities of organic carbon for long periods of time. This study explores organic carbon stock change through the first comparative study of radiometric analysis and repeat field measures over a multi-decadal period in a mangrove system. Examining one tall gallery forest of Avicennia marina, and an adjacent interior scrub mangrove of mixed Avicennia marina and Aegiceras corniculatum, radiometric analysis estimated a soil organic carbon accumulation rate of 4.3 Â± 0.6Â MgÂ CÂ haâˆ’1Â yâˆ’1 in the tall gallery forest and 2.2 Â± 0.5Â MgÂ CÂ haâˆ’1Â yâˆ’1 in a stunted mangrove. Repeat measures of root carbon separated by 30Â years estimated an increase of 5.06Â MgÂ CÂ haâˆ’1Â yâˆ’1 in the tall forest and 6.63Â Mg CÂ haâˆ’1Â yâˆ’1 in the stunted forestâ€”suggesting an underestimate of carbon accumulation by radiometric dating of 15% and 67% in the tall and stunted forest, respectively. A higher carbon stock in the interior forest was attributed to root mass increase, associated with landward mangrove encroachment. Extrapolated to the entire region of NSW we estimate that mangrove encroachment has contributed at least about 1.8Â TgÂ C sequestration over the 70Â years for which this has been observed in New South Wales, Australia.

TI  - Species composition, stand characteristics, aboveground biomass, and carbon stock of mangroves in panabo mangrove park, philippines
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems have been recognized for their roles in climate change mitigation through their carbon sequestration capacity. However, information on the ecology and carbon stock of mangroves is limited. Thus, this study assessed the species composition, stand characteristics, aboveground biomass, and carbon stock of mangroves in Panabo Mangrove Park, Panabo City, Davao del Norte, Philippines. Data for vegetation analysis and biodiversity assessment were collected using transect line plots method. Meanwhile, aboveground biomass estimation was conducted using nondestructive method. Twenty plots with size of 10 m x 10 m each were established to account for the stand characteristics and aboveground biomass of mangroves. Species composition data identified five species from four families. Avicennia marina was the most important species with an importance value of 153.33%. Stand structure analysis revealed a basal area of 14.65 mÂ² haâ»Â¹ and a mean density of 11835 stems haâ»Â¹. Biodiversity indices indicated very low species diversity (Hâ€™ = 1.027), low species richness (R = 0.5148) and less even distribution of species (J = 0.6383). Using allometric equation, the aboveground biomass was 77.45 Mg haâ»Â¹ with an estimated stored carbon of 37.18 Mg haâ»Â¹ and sequestration potential of 136.44 Mg COâ‚‚haâ»Â¹. These baseline data demonstrate that the area can store and sequester potential amounts of carbon and carbon dioxide, respectively, despite the low diversity.

TI  - Does Regional Development Influence Sedimentary Blue Carbon Stocks? A Case Study From Three Australian Estuaries
AB  - Mitigating climate change through the reduction of atmospheric CO2 levels is of interest, particularly through maintaining and re-establishing natural ecosystems that act as carbon sinks, such as coastal vegetated habitats or ``blue carbon{''} systems. Here we compare sedimentary blue carbon (C) stocks from 37 sediment cores collected in pristine (n = 13), agricultural (n = 11), and urban (n = 13) estuaries within the same geomorphological region, located on the eastern coast of Australia. The mean estimated C stocks for each carbon system (seagrass, mangrove, and saltmarshes) were 402 +/- 78, 830 +/- 109, and 723 +/- 100 Mg C ha(-1), respectively, conservatively estimated up to 3 m depths. Analysis of variance revealed no significant difference between C stocks per area (C ha(-1)) considering each habitat type and between specific estuaries. However, the total estuarine C stocks were found to be greater with increasing levels of conservation, based on larger areas of blue carbon vegetation. The potential loss of C to the atmosphere from these small regional estuaries are 500,574 +/- 118,635 tons of CO2 equivalent (CO(2)e), based on specific assumptions. The implication of these results are that there are large C stocks in small regional estuaries which supports the protection of blue C systems in developing coastal areas and highlights the uncertainties of the CO2 emissions from potential blue C habitat degradation.

TI  - Tree biomass and soil carbon stocks of a mangrove ecosystem on the Egyptian-African Red Sea coast
AB  - Mangroves are key ecosystems in strategies addressing the mitigation of climate change through carbon storage in several countries around the world. The main objective of this study is to quantify the carbon storage (above- and below-ground) in the biomass and sediment of mangrove forests (Avicennia marina and Rhizophora mucronata), as well as to estimate the carbon sequestration potential in the Gebel Elba Protected Area along the Egyptian-African Red Sea Coast. The mean recorded soil bulk density in both mangrove species was 1.16 g cm(-3), while the recorded mean soil organic carbon (SOC) content was 34.95 g C kg(-1). The total mean SOC content was statistically higher in A. marina stands (39.66 g C kg(-1)) than in R. mucronata stands (33.15 g C kg(-1)). The total mean SOC density for A. marina and R. mucronata amounts to 40.60 kg C m(-3). We recorded the carbon sequestration rate of mangrove forests in Egypt as 11.36 g C m(-2) year and the total carbon sequestration potential as 5.97Gg C year The average single tree biomass was notably highly variable between different mangrove species and sites, with a total average tree biomass of 164.8 and 43.7kg tree(-1) for A. marina and R. mucronata, respectively. The results show that the average total tree carbon content is 74.3 and 18.0 kg tree(-1) for A. marina and R. mucronata, respectively. While the recorded tree below-ground biomass was 54.1 and 32.6 kg tree(-1), and above-ground biomass was 110.7 and 11.1 kg tree(-1) for A. marina and R. mucronata, respectively. The recorded average biomass per hectare of mangrove was 74997.1 and 22536.8 kg for A. marina and R. mucronata, respectively. Moreover, the average total tree carbon content per hectare was 33782.3 and 9304.74 for A. marina and R. mucronata, respectively. However, for Egypt mangroves (525 ha), the total organic carbon content amounts to 17.73 Gg C for biomass and 5.97Gg C year(-1) for soil, with total of 23.7Gg C of organic carbon content storage in the mangrove ecosystem in Egypt.

TI  - Coastal landforms and accumulation of mangrove peat increase carbon sequestration and storage
AB  - Given their relatively small area, mangroves and their organic sediments are of disproportionate importance to global carbon sequestration and carbon storage. Peat deposition and preservation allows some mangroves to accrete vertically and keep pace with sea-level rise by growing on their own root remains. In this study we show that mangroves in desert inlets in the coasts of the Baja California have been accumulating root peat for nearly 2,000 y and harbor a belowground carbon content of 900-34,00 Mg C/ha, with an average value of 1,130 (+/- 128) Mg C/ha, and a belowground carbon accumulation similar to that found under some of the tallest tropical mangroves in the Mexican Pacific coast. The depth-age curve for the mangrove sediments of Baja California indicates that sea level in the peninsula has been rising at a mean rate of 0.70 mm/y (+/- 0.07) during the last 17 centuries, a value similar to the rates of sea-level rise estimated for the Caribbean during a comparable period. By accreting on their own accumulated peat, these desert mangroves store large amounts of carbon in their sediments. We estimate that mangroves and halophyte scrubs in Mexico's arid northwest, with less than 1\% of the terrestrial area, store in their belowground sediments around 28\% of the total belowground carbon pool of the whole region.

TI  - Estimating and Mapping Mangrove Biomass Dynamic Change Using WorldView-2 Images and Digital Surface Models
AB  - Mapping and quantification of biomass changes is critical to understanding mangrove carbon sequestration, conservation, and restoration. Few previous studies have focused on mangrove biomass changes based on high spatial resolution images, particularly for disturbed and recovering areas. This study developed an effective model to estimate and map mangrove aboveground biomass dynamic change between 2010 and 2016 on Qi'ao Island in South China. The study area includes native Kandelia candel (K. candel) and planted Sonneratia apetala (S. apetala) mangrove species within the largest planted area in China. Models were developed using WorldView-2 images, digital surface models (DSMs), and the random forest algorithm. Accuracies of the model were assessed using multiyear field samples. DSMs were identified as the most important variable for model accuracy, reducing relative error by up to 3.14\%. Three models were developed: a model for 2010, another model for 2016, and a combined model for 2010 and 2016. Compared with the 2010 (RMSE = 41.03 t/ha, RMSEr = 24.31\%) and 2016 (RMSE = 39.92 t/ha, RMSEr = 23.40\%) models, the combined model (RMSE = 50.99 t/ha, RMSEr = 30.48\%) only increased the relative error by 6.17\% and 7.08\%, respectively. Mangrove biomass maps generated from the most accurate models showed total biomass increased from 23270.43 to 39819.03 tons by up to 71.11\% over the study period. K. candel total biomass decreased by 36.5\% due to Derris trifoliata challenge. S. apetala total biomass increased by 74.79\% due to reforestation programs, achieving aboveground biomass accumulation of 4.17 t/ha for stands that existed in 2010. This study provides insights into biomass dynamic change in disturbed and recovering mangrove areas. Future studies should consider using LiDAR techniques to obtain actual tree height applied for biomass estimation instead of DSM.

TI  - Allometric Model, Aboveground Biomass and Carbon Sequestration of Natural Regeneration of Avicennia lanata (Ridley). at in-active Pond of Muna Regency, Southeast Sulawesi
AB  - This study aimed to establish an allometric model for estimation of aboveground biomass, and carbon sequestration in A. lanata mangrove forest growing in Muna Regency, Southeast Sulawesi. Research methods were done by transect and 5 quadrats with size of 100 m2 each. A total of thirteen individual trees with different sizes were harvested. While DBH and D30 were measured. The samples were separated into stems, branches, and leaves and then weighted. The sample from each fresh organs were taken and brought to the Laboratory and then oven dried at 80Â°C for 7 days. The allometric equations were established by using independent variables (DBH and D30 ), and dependent variables (Ws, Wb, Wl). The partial and overall aboveground biomasses were calculated from allometric model, while carbon stock and CO2 sequestration were estimated. The results showed that the independent variable of DBH was more applicable for estimation of Ws, Wb, Wl, and total biomasses (Mg ha-1) of A. lanata forest, which were estimated as 28.28Â±3.48, 6.40Â±0.79, 5.00Â±0.66, and 40.08Â±4.97 respectively. The carbon stock in stems (13.24Â±1.63 Mg ha-1) was higher than in branches (3.01Â±0.37 Mg C ha-1) as well as in leaves (2.35Â±0.31 Mg C ha-1). The total of carbon stock were estimated at about 18.83Â±2.33 Mg C ha-1. Meanwhile, the total of CO2 absorption by A. lanata mangrove was 43.95Â±5.45 Mg CO2 ha-1. Therefore a regenerated A. lanata mangrove in this in-active pond area had potentiality on carbon stock and sequestrations, although these vegetation condition was still in the growth stage.

TI  - LargeCO(2)release and tidal flushing in salt marsh crab burrows reduce the potential for blue carbon sequestration
AB  - Abundant crab burrows in carbon-rich, muddy salt marsh soils act as preferential water flow conduits, potentially enhancing carbon transport across the soil-water interface. With increasing recognition of blue carbon systems (salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrass) as hotspots of soil carbon sequestration, it is important to understand drivers of soil carbon cycling and fluxes. We conducted field observations and flow modeling to assess how crab burrows drive carbon exchange over time scales of minutes to weeks in an intertidal marsh in South Carolina. Results showed that continuous advective porewater exchange between the crab burrows and the surrounding soil matrix occurs because of tidally driven hydraulic gradients. The concentrations of dissolved inorganic (DIC) and organic (DOC) carbon in crab burrow porewater differ with that in the surrounding soil matrix, implying a diffusive C flux in the low-permeability marsh soil. Gas-phase concentrations of CO(2)in similar to 300 crab burrows were approximately six times greater than ambient air. The estimated total C export rate via porewater exchange (1.0 +/- 0.7 g C m(-2)d(-1)) was much greater than via passive diffusion transport (6.7 +/- 2 mg C m(-2)d(-1)) and gas-phase CO(2)release (1.8 mg C m(-2)d(-1)). The burrow-related carbon export was comparable to the regional salt marsh DIC export, groundwater-derived DIC export, and the net primary production previously estimated using ecosystem-scale approaches. These insights reveal how crab burrows modify blue carbon sequestration in salt marshes and contribute to coastal carbon budgets.

TI  - Microbial decomposition of soil organic matter determined by edaphic characteristics of mangrove forests in East Asia
AB  - Mangrove forests cover only 0.1\% of the world's continental area; however, these are a substantial carbon sink owing to the high primary production and low rate of decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM).The extremely low decomposition rate of SOM in mangrove forests is believed to be caused by low oxygen and nutrient availability as well as recalcitrant biomass from mangrove. However, only a few studies have addressed the microbial mechanism that plays a key role in the decomposition of SOM. In this study, the decomposition of SUM were determined by conducting a field survey and an lab incubation experiment using soil samples from mangrove forests in three regions; Okinawa, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong. In particular, we examined the occurrence of the enzymic larch mechanism, which involves phenolic inhibition of enzymic decomposition, in mangrove forest soils that highlights the importance of phenol oxidase as a key controlling factor. The results clearly showed that enzymic larch involved in the accumulation of SOM in the mangroves of Shenzhen and Hong Kong, whereas the accumulation of SOM in Okinawa was controlled by other mechanisms, such as the iron gate mechanism, which involves stabilization of soil carbon in iron-SOM complexes. The characteristics of mangrove forests, such as iron concentration, were shown as substantial determination factors in the dynamics of SOM. We concluded that the decomposition of SOM were strongly affected by the characteristics of mangrove forests, and the occurrence of enzymic latch in mangrove forests has a potential application in geoengineering technology to enhance the carbon sequestration capacity of mangrove forests.

TI  - Effects of simulated sea level rise on stocks and sources of soil organic carbon in Kandelia obovata mangrove forests
AB  - Changes in stocks and sources of soil organic carbon (OC) with sea level rise (SLR) are crucial to carbon processes and sequestration benefits in mangrove forests. Soil OC contents and stocks were compared among three 11 years-old Kandelia obovata mangrove forests with SLR of 0, 40 and 80 cm, respectively, simulating the current, future ~100 yearsâ€™ and future ~200 yearsâ€™ SLR of mangrove forests along Jiulong River Estuary, an important K. obovata area in Fujian, China. Contribution rates of mangrove plants and allochthonous suspended particulate organic matter in tidal water (SPOM) to soil OC were also estimated. Significantly higher soil OC contents and stocks were measured at site SLR 80 cm. Mean OC stocks at sites SLR 80 cm, SLR 40 cm and SLR 0 cm were 23.82, 16.68 and 17.85 kg C mâˆ’2, respectively. High soil labile organic carbon (LOC) contents were also found at site SLR 80 cm, while low profiles of soil Î´13C values were measured at site SLR 40 cm. Mean contribution rates of mangrove plants to soil OC were 36.65%, 35.42% and 21.79% at sites SLR 80 cm, SLR 40 cm and SLR 0 cm, respectively, and significantly higher OC contribution rates of mangrove plants were found at site SLR 80 cm. These indicated that SLR will increase soil OC stock and mangrove contribution to soil OC. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Mangrove biomass estimation in Southwest Thailand using machine learning
AB  - Mangroves play a disproportionately large role in carbon sequestration relative to other tropical forest ecosystems. Accurate assessments of mangrove biomass at the site-scale are lacking, especially in mainland Southeast Asia. This study assessed tree biomass and species diversity within a 151ha mangrove ecosystem on the Andaman Coast of Thailand. High-resolution GeoEye-1 satellite imagery, medium resolution ASTER satellite elevation data, field-based tree measurements, published allometric biomass equations, and a suite of machine learning techniques were used to develop spatial models of mangrove biomass. Field measurements derived a whole-site tree density of 1313treesha-1, with Rhizophora spp. comprising 77.7% of the trees across forty-five 400m2 sample plots. A support vector machine regression model was found to be most accurate by cross-validation for predicting biomass at the site level. Model-estimated above-ground biomass was 250Mgha-1; below-ground root biomass was 95Mgha-1. Combined above-ground and below-ground biomass for the entire 151-ha stand was 345 (Â±72.5)Mgha-1, equivalent to 155 (Â±32.6)MgCha-1. Model evaluation shows the model had greatest prediction error at high biomass values, indicating a need for allometric equations determined over a larger range of tree sizes. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Species-specific biomass and carbon flux in Sundarbans mangrove forest, Bangladesh: Response to stand and weather variables
AB  - The species-specific potentiality of mangroves in terms of ecosystem services is not well understood. Therefore, this study addressed the carbon sequestration and litterfall production potentiality of six major species in Sundarbans, Bangladesh, by evaluating three consecutive years of inventory data, including the stand variables and weather events impacts on them. The total mean aboveground, belowground biomass, biomass accumulation, and carbon accumulation rate were 243.4 Mg haâˆ’1, 132.2 Mg haâˆ’1, and 14.3 Mg haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1, 7.2 Mg haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1, respectively. Carbon stocks and sequestration rates are significantly influenced by stand variables such as diameter, density, and species composition. Large-sized trees and stands with lower density sequester more carbon than small-sized trees, and higher density stands. Among species, Avicennia officinalis contributed higher carbon to carbon stocks and also significantly different from other species for sequestering carbon, whereas Aglaia cucullata was the lowest. Mean annual litterfall was 10.01 Mg haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1, with the maximum litterfall for Hereteira fomes (19.2 Mg haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1) during the late summer or wet season (e.g., April to August). Litterfall showed a significant positive (p &lt; 0.001) relation to weather variables such as rainfall, temperature, wind, etc. This study reports that the rate of carbon sequestration in Sundarbans was 17.21 Mg C haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1, which corresponds to 62.6 Mg haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1 CO2. High carbon stocks, carbon sequestration, and litterfall production rate in Sundarbans demonstrate the significance of mangrove species and Sundarbans in the global carbon budget. This information can be used in species selection for plantation, species conservation, and ecosystem management purposes at the regional and global levels. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Biomass accumulation and organic carbon stocks of Kandelia obovata mangrove vegetation under different simulated sea levels
AB  - Mangrove forests are vulnerably threatened by sea level rise (SLR). Vegetation organic carbon (OC) stocks are important for mangrove ecosystem carbon cycle. It is critical to understand how SLR affects vegetation OC stocks for evaluating mangrove blue carbon budget and global climate change. In this study, biomass accumulation and OC stocks of mangrove vegetation were compared among three 10 year-old Kandelia obovata (a common species in China) mangrove forests under three intertidal elevations through species-specific allometric equations. This study simulated mangrove forests with SLR values of 0 cm, 40 cm and 80 cm, respectively, representing for the current, future similar to 100 a and future similar to 200 a SLR of mangrove forests along the Jiulong River Estuary, China. SLR directly decreased mangrove individual density and inhibited the growth of mangrove vegetation. The total vegetation biomasses were (12.86 +/- 0.95) kg/m(2), (7.97 +/- 0.90) kg/m(2) and (3.89 +/- 0.63) kg/m(2) at Sites SLR 0 cm, SLR 40 cm and SLR 80 cm, respectively. The total vegetation OC stock decreased by approximately 3.85 kg/m(2) (in terms of C) from Site SLR 0 cm to Site SLR 80 cm. Significantly lower vegetation biomass and OC stock of various components (stem, branch, leaf and root) were found at Site SLR 80 cm. Annual increments of vegetation biomass and OC stock also decreased with SLR increase. Moreover, significant lower sedimentation rate was found at Site SLR 80 cm. These indicated that SLR will decrease mangrove vegetation biomass and OC stock, which may reduce global blue carbon sink by mangroves, exacerbate global warming and give positive feedback to SLR.

TI  - Significance of blue carbon in ecological aquaculture in the context of interrelated issues: A case study of Costa Rica
AB  - There is an increasing global awareness of the socioeconomic and ecological significance of coastal and marine ecosystems and aquaculture. Marine ecosystems have been substantially affected by unsustainable exploitation and abuse, leading to their degradation and decline in their capacity to provide ecosystems services. The focus of this chapter is on blue carbon stocks and their significance in coastal marine aquaculture. This chapter presents a holistic discussion of blue carbon and aquaculture, which touches upon multiple factors that are intricately linked, thus requiring elaboration of the complexity of the factors. In ecological aquaculture, stability of ecosystem is vitally important, and it is this stability which is threatened by aquaculture if carried out as an activity that is not consistent with the environmental thresholds. Many intensive aquaculture practices which disturbed the functional capacity of critical coastal ecosystem have failed to recognize the impacts of such activities on long-term food supply. Blue carbon is a term that has been coined to refer to carbon sequestration and storage in aquatic vegetation ecosystems. It is part of a trend in the sustainability literature that seeks to highlight the importance of ecosystem services in order to promote their conservation within diverse institutional alternatives to command and control policies. One of these alternatives is the global carbon market, which may provide financial incentives to protect and conserve natural ecosystems through the development of carbon offset projects. Specifically, blue carbon offset projects may provide additional incentives to protect and rehabilitate mangrove ecosystems in synchronization with aquaculture production. Aquaculture that is compatible with conservation of aquatic vegetation ecosystems is resilient and fares better in terms of sustainability. This not only helps aquaculture supply more aquatic food but also plays a responsible role towards fisheries and mitigating the effects of climate change. Given the fact that the topic of blue carbon is still in its nascent stage, there are a number of interrelated issues that need to be discussed to understand the key ingredients required to develop the linkages between blue carbon and aquaculture. An exclusive focus on blue carbon vis-Ã -vis aquaculture ignores the other related factors, resulting in a discussion that is not adequate in terms of its outcomes for integrated management of coastal marine resources for sustainable seafood supplies. This chapter, therefore, will distil the current science and implementation mechanisms of blue carbon projects and highlight their links with ecological aquaculture. The topic of blue carbon and aquaculture has not been discussed in scientific or grey literature, and this chapter intends to provide a novel approach that explains the synergies that may be achievable between blue carbon and ecological aquaculture through a case study in Costa Rica.

TI  - The spatial distribution of blue carbon in the coastal wetlands of China
AB  - Coastal wetland losses in China are globally-relevant issues, as formerly sequestered soil organic carbon is released as CO2 into the atmosphere. Wetland losses also reduce the primary production by plants that would otherwise bury carbon in the future. More than 50\% of these ecosystems have been lost globally over the last half century, with this number approaching 58\% in China. The negotiation of international accords such as the Paris Climate Agreement rely on the accurate assessment of ecosystem-held carbon quantities. Our objective was to provide the first national scale survey of coastal wetland-based carbon in China. The average soil organic carbon stock (Mg SOC ha(-1)) across all three types of ecosystems was 236.91, with an average of 344.67 for mangroves, 175.14 for seagrass, and 134.37 for salt marshes. The SOC stock was greatest at 30-60 cm of depth in the case of mangroves, as opposed to 0-20 cm of depth for salt marshes. In terms of the carbon content of the standing aboveground and belowground biomass (Mg C ha(-1)), mangroves contained by far the most with an average of 253.98 and 83.96, respectively. Carbon burial rates, or the annual flux of SOC into the soil column (Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)), were 2.26 +/- 0.39 for mangroves, 1.38 +/- 0.38 for seagrass, and 2.18 +/- 0.24 for salt marshes. Through our work, we found a total of 48.12-123.95 Tg of C in China's coastal wetlands (down to 1 m of soil column depth), with an annual burial of 0.84 Tg yr(-1). We estimate the average annual emissions of CO2 to be on the order of 6.83 Tg CO2 yr(-1), due to ongoing and extensive wetland loss and conversion.

TI  - Carbon stocks of intact mangroves and carbon emissions arising from their conversion in the Dominican Republic
AB  - Mangroves are recognized to possess a variety of ecosystem services including high rates of carbon sequestration and storage. Deforestation and conversion of these ecosystems continue to be high and have been predicted to result in significant carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Yet few studies have quantified the carbon stocks or losses associated with conversion of these ecosystems. In this study we quantified the ecosystem carbon stocks of three common mangrove types of the Caribbean as well as those of abandoned shrimp ponds in areas formerly occupied by mangrove-a common land-use conversion of mangroves throughout the world. In the mangroves of the Montecristi Province in Northwest Dominican Republic we found C stocks ranged from 706 to 1131 Mg/ha. The medium-statured mangroves (3-10 m in height) had the highest C stocks while the tall (&gt;10 m) mangroves had the lowest ecosystem carbon storage. Carbon stocks of the low mangrove (shrub) type (&lt;3 m) were relatively high due to the presence of carbon-rich soils as deep as 2 m. Carbon stocks of abandoned shrimp ponds were 95 Mg/ha or âˆ¼11% that of the mangroves. Using a stock-change approach, the potential emissions from the conversion of mangroves to shrimp ponds ranged from 2244 to 3799 Mg CO2e/ha (CO2 equivalents). This is among the largest measured C emissions from land use in the tropics. The 6260 ha of mangroves and converted mangroves in the Montecristi Province are estimated to contain 3 841 490 Mg of C. Mangroves represented 76% of this area but currently store 97% of the carbon in this coastal wetland (3 696 722 Mg C). Converted lands store only 4% of the total ecosystem C (144 778 Mg C) while they comprised 24% of the area. By these metrics the replacement of mangroves with shrimp and salt ponds has resulted in estimated emissions from this region totaling 3.8 million Mg CO2e or âˆ¼21% of the total C prior to conversion. Given the high C stocks of mangroves, the high emissions from their conversion, and the other important functions and services they provide, their inclusion in climate-change mitigation strategies is warranted.

TI  - Pathways for Understanding Blue Carbon Microbiomes with Amplicon Sequencing
AB  - The capacity of Blue Carbon Ecosystems to act as carbon sinks is strongly influenced by the metabolism of soil-associated microbes, which ultimately determine how much carbon is accumulated or returned to the atmosphere. The rapid evolution of sequencing technologies has facilitated the generation of tremendous amounts of data on what taxa comprise belowground microbial assemblages, largely available as isolated datasets, offering an opportunity for synthesis research that informs progress on understanding Blue Carbon microbiomes. We identified questions that can be addressed with a synthesis approach, including the high variability across datasets, space, and time due to differing sampling techniques, ecosystem or vegetation specificity, and the relationship between microbiome community and edaphic properties, particularly soil carbon. To address these questions, we collated 34 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing datasets, including bulk soil or rhizosphere from seagrass, mangroves, and saltmarshes within publicly available repositories. We identified technical and theoretical challenges that precluded a synthesis of multiple studies with currently available data, and opportunities for addressing the knowledge gaps within Blue Carbon microbial ecology going forward. Here, we provide a standardisation toolbox that supports enacting tasks for the acquisition, management, and integration of Blue Carbon-associated sequencing data and metadata to potentially elucidate novel mechanisms behind Blue Carbon dynamics.

TI  - Submarine Groundwater Discharge-Derived Carbon Fluxes in Mangroves: An Important Component of Blue Carbon Budgets?
AB  - Plain Language Summary Mangroves are blue carbon systems characterized by high soil carbon storage and sequestration. Soil carbon losses via groundwater or pore water pathways are potentially important yet poorly understood components of mangrove carbon budgets. Here we quantified submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) and associated dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and organic carbon (DOC) fluxes into a mangrove-dominated tropical bay (Maowei Sea) using a radon (Rn-222) mass balance model. The SGD fluxes in Maowei Sea were estimated to be 4.9x10(7) (0.360.33m/day) and 2.6x10(7)m(3)/day (0.200.18m/day) for the wet and dry seasons, respectively, implying that SGD may respond to precipitation. The SGD-derived DIC and DOC fluxes (molm(-2)day(-1)) in the wet season (DIC: 0.700.82; DOC: 0.310.30) were higher than those in the dry season (DIC: 0.250.24; DOC: 0.25 +/- 0.23). These SGD-derived carbon fluxes exceed local river inputs and constituted >70\% of the total DIC and DOC input into the bay. If scaled up to the global weighted mangrove area in combination with data from other 32 study sites, carbon fluxes via SGD into mangroves may be equivalent to 29-48\% of the global riverine input into the ocean. Therefore, we suggest that SGD is a major component of coastal carbon budgets and that accounting for SGD helps to reduce uncertainties in mangrove blue carbon budgets. Mangrove soils sequester large amounts of carbon, but little is known on the loss of carbon via groundwater pathways. Here we quantified submarine groundwater discharge using radon and related dissolved inorganic and organic carbon fluxes in a mangrove-dominated tropical bay in China (Maowei Sea). Combining our results with literature data revealed that groundwater fluxes in mangroves are significant and should be considered in blue carbon assessments.

TI  - CHANGE IN ECOSYSTEM CARBON STORAGE OF THE MANGROVE FOREST ALONG THE CHINESE COAST BETWEEN 1990 AND 2010
AB  - Mangrove forests provide important ecological services, and play a critical role in global carbon cycling. Although temporal changes in ecosystem carbon storage have been assessed in upland forests, there has been a lack of scientific evaluation of such change in mangrove forests. In this study, in order to overcome the shortage of soil organic carbon (SOC) data for estimating SOC storage, a simple linear regression equation between vegetation biomass and SOC density (R = 0.697, P < 0.01, N = 39) was derived to quantify the change of ecosystem carbon storage by combining field measurements with data from the published literature. Significant correlation was found between vegetation biomass and SOC concentration of the surface soil layer in the mangrove forests. Ecosystem carbon storage increased from 1037.55 Gg in 1990 to 1449.96 Gg in 2010, with an average carbon accumulation of 111.53 Gg/year in the mangrove forests along the Chinese coast. Ecosystem carbon density increased from 280.56 t/ha in 1990 to 299.14 t/ha in 2010, with an average carbon uptake of 0.93 t/(ha.year). Average carbon accumulation rate in the soil accounted for more than 80\% of the total carbon accumulation rate. Mangrove forests accumulate more ecosystem carbon in comparison with other types of forests located at the same latitudes. Our results suggest that afforestation and reforestation will increase carbon sequestration in the mangrove forests along the Chinese coast, as both vegetation carbon and SOC storage increased in association with biomass growth.

TI  - Blue carbon sink function and carbon neutrality potential of mangroves
AB  - Mangroves are widely distributed in the upper part of tropical and subtropical intertidal zones, with the characteristics of high productivity and fast deposition rate. Under the combined action of its own growth and microorganisms, mangroves capture, transform and store CO2 in the atmosphere into coastal sediment for a long time, and export some organic carbon from the coastal zone to the offshore and ocean, which is of great significance to prevent coastal erosion and organic carbon burial. In recent years, with the worldwide problems caused by global warming, the concept of carbon neutrality has been widely proposed. Mangroves have attracted extensive attention due to their role in regulating the global carbon cycle. This viewpoint discusses the importance of mangroves to human beings, their role in carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling, their ability to capture CO2, and their carbon sequestration functions and mechanisms, aiming to provide reference for the protection and rational utilization of mangrove resources.

TI  - Carbon sequestration potential of Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh. and Rhizophora mucronata Lam. along the Western Red Sea Coast of Egypt
AB  - Increased levels of global atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and further consequences of climate change derived more research efforts to emphasize the actual role of the ecosystems of higher significance in this task. Mangrove ecosystem received a great interest in the demonstration of its potential to sequester atmospheric CO2. Sampling process from the sediment of mangrove ecosystem extended some 600Â km along the Egyptian western coast of Red Sea, starting from Abu Monquar Island (27.216250Â° N, 33.876288Â° E) at the north near Hurghada to Sharm El-Madfaâ€™a (22.895165Â° N, 35.717757Â° E) near the Egyptianâ€“Sudanese frontiers. This work compares the pure population of Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh. and Rhizophora mucronata, Lam. as well as the mixed population of both species. Mean values of dry bulk density (DBD) were 1.2 Â± 0.02, gÂ cmâˆ’3 for pure A. marina, 0.8 Â± 0.06Â gÂ cmâˆ’3 for pure R. mucronata, and 0.7 Â± 0.04Â gÂ cmâˆ’3 for mixed sites. In addition, the values of mean soil organic carbon (SOC) were 10.2, 51.7 and 89.0Â gÂ CÂ kgâˆ’1 for pure A. marina, pure R. mucronata and mixed sites, respectively. On the other hand, the mean values of soil organic carbon pool (SOCP) were 258.0, 604.7 and 1049.3Â MgÂ CÂ haâˆ’1 for pure A. marina, pure R. mucronata and mixed sites of both species, respectively. The carbon sequestration potential (CSP) of pure A. marina, pure R. mucronata, and mixed sites of both species were 0.8, 2.2, 3.4Â MgÂ CÂ haâˆ’1Â yearâˆ’1, respectively.

TI  - Large variability in organic carbon and CaCO3 burial in seagrass meadows: a case study from three Australian estuaries
AB  - Blue carbon refers to the carbon accumulation capacity of vegetated coastal habitats, including salt marshes, mangroves forests and seagrass meadows. Here we present estimates of organic carbon (C-org) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) burial rates from 4 seagrass species (Halophila ovalis, Posidonia australis, Ruppia megacarpa, Zostera muelleri) in 3 temperate estuaries on the east coast of Australia. The C-org burial rates (mean +/- SE) varied by an order of magnitude across the seagrass communities (16 +/- 3 to 130 +/- 40 g m(-2) yr(-1)). The delta C-13(org) and C-org:N ratios suggest that the seagrass communities buried variable mixtures of seagrass, algal and mangrove/terrestrial material. CaCO3 burial rates ranged from 15 +/- 11 to 188 +/- 122 g m(-2) yr(-1), which, if precipitated by calcifying organisms in these or nearby habitats, may offset up to 89\% of the C-org burial across the 8 seagrass communities. Our results highlight a large range in both C-org and CaCO3 burial rates, and the provenance of the carbon sequestered in seagrasses, factors that need to be considered when assessing the role of seagrasses in blue carbon and climate change mitigation strategies.

TI  - Development of ecosystem carbon stock with the progression of a natural mangrove forest in Yingluo Bay, China
AB  - Aims Mangrove ecosystems play an important role in mitigating climate change with their capacity to sequester and store carbon. Mangrove can store larger amount of carbon in their soil than any other tropical forests in the same latitude. The coastline is a highly dynamic environment, mangroves can develop at the mudflat with stands of different ages paralleling the shoreline. Hence, this study aimed to assess the role of mangrove growth on ecosystem carbon stock. Methods Four sites, including natural mangrove stands with different ages (15, 45 and 80-yr-old) and mudflat were selected. Vegetation biomass and the soil carbon content from 0 to 100 cm were analyzed. Results Ecosystem carbon stocks (including biomass carbon stocks and 0-100 cm soil organic carbon stocks) of 15-yr-old, 45-yr-old and 80-yr-old stands are 171.57 t ha(-1), 274.53 t ha(-1) and 380.72 t ha(-1),respectively, and are 1.76, 2.82 and 3.91 times higher, than that of the bare mudflat ecosystem (111.23 t ha(-1)). Moreover, the vegetation carbon stocks in 15-yr-old, 45-yr-old and 80-yr-old forest stands account for 33.78\%, 17.74\%, and 12.33\% of the ecosystem carbon density, respectively. The annual accumulation rates of the ecosystem carbon stocks are 3.61 t ha(-1), 3.43 t ha(-1) and 2.78 t ha(-1) for 15-yr-old, 45-yr-old and 80-yr-old stands, respectively. Conclusions The mangrove stand characteristics and its soil properties were changed with the mangrove ages. The contribution of vegetation biomass carbon stock to ecosystem carbon stock increased along the chronology, while the soil showed the opposite pattern. The annual accumulation rate of ecosystem carbon stocks decreased along the chronology.

TI  - Modelling predictive changes of blue carbon due to sea-level rise using InVEST model in Chilaw Lagoon, Sri Lanka
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems such as mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds, are vital for mitigating climate change owing to their high capacity for carbon capture and storage. Sea-level rise (SLR), as a result of climate change, poses a severe threat to these ecosystems due to the proximity of these ecosystems to coastal margins and, thus, modelling how blue carbon within these ecosystems will respond to SLR scenarios will prove vital to the effective management and conservation of these ecosystems. The Chilaw lagoon in Sri Lanka is home to considerably small and highly disturbed mangrove forests (422.92 ha) where the blue carbon dynamics of the lagoon are poorly studied. The primary objective of this study was to model and predict the possible changes to blue carbon in the Chilaw lagoon owing to the impact of SLR, making use of the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST 3.11.0) Coastal Blue Carbon Model. Carbon storage, carbon accumulation, carbon emissions, net carbon sequestration, and valuation of net carbon sequestration were modelled considering four SLR scenarios relating to Shared Socioeconomic Pathways indicated in the 6th assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for years 2100 and 2150. The only blue carbon land-use land cover (LULC) identified was the mangrove forest. The present blue carbon stock in the ecosystem was found to be 991.52 MgC and it is predicted to be 2049.93 MgC in the year 2100. In the year 2150, the influence of SLR is evident and carbon stocks are predicted to decrease with increasing extents of inundation. Total carbon sequestration (2021-2150), the monetary value of carbon sequestration in 2150, and carbon accumulation (2100-2150) were all predicted to decrease with rising sea levels. Emissions of carbon were found to increase with the increasing level of disturbance owing to SLR. The study represents the first time the InVEST model was utilized to model blue carbon dynamics in Sri Lanka and indicates the possible changes to blue carbon in the Chilaw lagoon and quantifies it as well.

TI  - The potential of delta ecosystem in North Coast of Java in reducing CO2 emissions
AB  - Global warming causes more carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The mangrove forest is one of the world's largest carbon sinks, as it is capable of storing and absorbing CO2 more than other forests. This research aims to determine carbon storage and CO2 sequestration at various zones of mangrove forests on the Wulan Delta, i.e. pond, river, and coastal zone, also determine the potential of delta ecosystem in North Coast of Java in reducing CO2 emissions with Wulan Delta as the sample. Systematic and non-destructive sampling method was used by measuring the Diameter at Height Breast (DBH) of mangrove trees with a diameter of &gt;5 cm inside plot areas of 10 m x 10 m each, and the measurement result was then calculated based on an allometric equation. The mangrove forest of Wulan Delta has the above-ground of carbon density 245.578 ton C/ha, root carbon density of 100.778 ton C/ha, and soil carbon density of 42,991.169 ton C/ha. It sums up to the total carbon storage of 9,171,845.27 ton C and CO2 sequestration of 33,660,672.12 ton CO2 with an annual sequestration value of 1,530,030.55 tons CO2/year. The CO2 sequstration results are then compared with the delta in North Coast of Java with extrapolation method. The results obtained that Delta in North Coast of Java can absorb CO2 national emissions in 2018 by 3.416x10-6 CO2/year. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Improving mangrove above-ground biomass estimates using LiDAR
AB  - Tree height is a key parameter to accurately quantify above ground biomass (AGB) of trees. Approaches that integrate airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) with mapped extents of forests may improve estimation of mangrove heights by providing considerably more measurements of mangrove tree heights than can be achieved using field-based measurements alone. In this study, we present a validated method for quantifying mangrove AGB that was demonstrated for a mangrove forest at Guar.as Island, Brazil. The application of LiDAR to estimate mangrove height was confirmed by correlating 89 tree heights measured in the field with LiDAR-derived mangrove heights, resulting in highly robust relationships for Avicennia germinans, Laguncularia racemosa and Rhizophora mangle (R-2 = 0.90-0.97, RMSE of 1.24-0.67 m and RMSE\% of 11.26\%-25.97\%). These relationships were used to calibrate a LiDAR-derived canopy height model (CHM) and develop robust relationships between the calibrated-CHM and field-based estimates of AGB (R-2 = 0.85-0.92, RMSE of 3.1 kg-42.53 kg, RMSE\% of 20.66\%-43.81\%). This relationship was then applied to the CHM whilst accounting for tree density to estimate mangrove AGB. Total mangrove AGB per hectare was estimated to be 246.90 t ha(-1), corresponding closely with previous mangrove AGB measurements within the region. This study found that mangrove height and AGB are statistically related and these relationships can be applied to allometric equations for specific species to improve mangrove AGB estimates. This study demonstrates the capacity for LiDAR-derived tree heights to replace traditional approaches to estimating AGB and improving estimates of mangrove blue carbon storage. Application of LiDAR to determine tree heights will be particularly useful where mangrove is extensive and/or remote.

TI  - Blue Carbon Stocks and Cross-Habitat Subsidies
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (including saltmarsh, mangrove, seagrass meadows, and other soft sediment habitats) play a valuable role in aquatic carbon dynamics and contribute significantly to global climate change mitigation. However, these habitats are undergoing rapid and accelerating shifts in extent due to climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we demonstrate that blue carbon stocks vary across habitats and that cross-habitat subsidies of carbon contribute significantly to blue carbon stocks. Using a case study estuary from New Zealand, organic carbon stocks in above ground biomass and sediment to 100 cm varied significantly between habitat types, from saltmarsh (90 t ha(-1)), to mangrove (46 t ha(-1)), to seagrass (27 t ha(-1)) and unvegetated habitats (26 t ha(-1)). Despite being typically overlooked in blue carbon literature, unvegetated habitats contained the majority of estuarine carbon stocks when adjusted for their large extent within the estuary (occupying 68.4\% of the estuarine area and containing 57\% of carbon stocks). When carbon stocks were further refined based on delta C-13 and delta N-15 mixing model results, coastal vegetation (saltmarsh, mangrove, and seagrass) was found to provide important cross-habitat subsidies of carbon throughout the estuary, including contributing an estimated 41\% of organic carbon within unvegetated sediments, and 51\% of the total carbon stock throughout the estuary (yet occupying only 31.6\% of the estuary). Given the connected nature of blue carbon ecosystems these findings illustrate the importance of considering the contribution and cross-habitat subsidies of both vegetated and unvegetated habitats to blue carbon stocks in estuaries. This provides critical context when assessing the impact of shifts in habitat distributions due to impacts from climate change and anthropogenic stressors.

TI  - Mangrove blue carbon strategies for climate change mitigation are most effective at the national scale
AB  - Carbon fixed by vegetated coastal ecosystems (blue carbon) can mitigate anthropogenic CO2 emissions, though its effectiveness differs with the spatial scale of interest. A literature review compiling carbon sequestration rates within key ecosystems confirms that blue carbon ecosystems are the most efficient natural carbon sinks at the plot scale, though some overlooked biogeochemical processes may lead to overestimation. Moreover, the limited spatial extent of coastal habitats minimizes their potential at the global scale, only buffering 0.42% of the global fossil fuel carbon emissions in 2014. Still, blue carbon plays a role for countries with moderate fossil fuel emissions and extensive coastlines. In 2014, mangroves mitigated greater than 1% of national fossil fuel emissions for countries such as Bangladesh, Colombia and Nigeria. Considering that the Paris Agreement is based on nationally determined contributions, we propose that mangrove blue carbon may contribute to climate change mitigation at this scale in some instances alongside other blue carbon ecosystems.

TI  - Spatio-temporal characteristics and main influencing factors of vegetation net primary productivity in the Yellow River Delta in recent 30 years
AB  - Salt marsh vegetation, mangrove, and sea grass in coastal areas are highly efficient carbon sinks; the carbon sequestrated by these is described as coastal blue carbon and their ecosystems are described as coastal blue carbon ecosystems. The coastline of China is long and the coastal blue carbon ecosystems are widely distributed. With rapid development of economy and consistent increase in CO2 emission, exploring the potential of coastal blue carbon has become an important way to increase the carbon sink and decrease the pressure of CO2 emission. It is of great significance to identify the temporal and spatial characteristics of net primary productivity (NPP) in coastal blue carbon ecosystems under various and complex anthropogenic disturbances. The study was conducted in the Yellow River Delta, and the recent 30 years (1987, 1995, 2005 and 2016-2017) was used as the time scale for analysis. The spatio-temporal characteristics and main influencing factors were analyzed using data from remote sensing and field investigations. The results indicated that: The mean value and total amount of NPP decreased first and then increased slightly during the recent 30 years, and the mean values of NPP in the summer of 1987, 1995, 2005, and 2016 were 94.93, 63.90, 64.56, and 69.54g Cm-2 month"1, respectively. The mean value and total amount of NPP in the year 2016-2017 were 294.38g Cm-2 a-1 and 710.05GgC/a which showed distinct seasonal differences. Obvious spatial heterogeneity existed in different districts, nature reserves, and land cover types. Comparing the different districts, Lijin County possessed larger temporal fluctuation of NPP than the other two districts. The mean value of NPP inside natural reserves was higher than that outside the natural reserves, which was higher in the experimental zone of the nature reserve than in the buffer and core zones. Further, the mean values of NPP were similar in old and new estuaries in the year 2016-2017. Among the different land cover types, wetland vegetation possessed the highest mean value and total amount of NPP, followed by farmland. The NPP values in other land cover types were low. The results from NPP partitioning for the year 2016-2017 showed that the proportion of area with medium NPP was the most (49.5%), followed by low NPP (38.3%), and high NPP (12.1%). The spatio-temporal characteristics of NPP were determined by land cover types and vegetation growth conditions. The land-sea interaction, exploitation activities, and ecological establishment in recent years were the main influencing factors of the spatio-temporal variations in NPP in the study area. Wetland vegetation and farmland were the main contributors of carbon sink and their mean values of NPP increased steadily since the 1990s, and reached 570.28g Cm-2 a-1 and 335.92g Cm-2 a-1 in the year 2016-2017. In the 30 years, the total amount of NPP continuously decreased in wetland vegetation and increased in farmland. Wetland vegetation is the typical carrier of coastal blue carbon. Meanwhile, farmland, which is located in coastal areas, transformed from wetland vegetation, and possesses high ability and potential for carbon sequestration, can be considered as an important supplement for coastal blue carbon.

TI  - Estimating carbon emission and baseline for blue carbon ecosystems in indonesia
AB  - There is a good chance for Indonesia, the largest archipelagic state in the world, to contribute to climate change mitigation effort by optimizing the 'regulating and maintenance' ecosystem service in the form of 'blue carbon' function provided by mangrove and seagrass. These so called 'blue carbon' ecosystems have 3-5 times capacity of storing and sequestering carbon compared to terrestrial vegetation. This paper attempts to provide the estimation of baseline or Business as Usual (BAU) scenario for blue carbon ecosystems which would be required if formal emission inventory of 'blue carbon' ecosystems is to be implemented. The result shows mangrove degradation occurs both during base years of 2000 - 2016 and during the projected emission period of 2017 - 2030. Mangrove conversion to aquaculture pond is the main cause of degradation, contributing up to 72.50 % of the total carbon emission. Blue carbon climate change mitigation by mangrove rehabilitation can only reduce up to 6 % of carbon emission from baseline in 2030. Significant emission reduction of 73,38% from BAU emission in 2030 can only be achieved through integration of mangrove rehabilitation, silvofishery practice and the prevention of mangrove conversion to other land-uses.

TI  - Mangrove distribution and afforestation potential in the Red Sea
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems represent one of the most effective natural environments for fixing and storing carbon (C). Mangroves also offer significant co-benefits, serving as nurseries for marine species, providing nutrients and food to support marine ecosystems, and stabilizing coastlines from erosion and extreme events. Given these considerations, mangrove afforestation and associated C sequestration has gained considerable attention as a nature-based solution to climate adaptation (e.g., protect against more frequent storm surges) and mitigation (e.g. offsetting other C-producing activities). To advance our understanding and description of these important ecosystems, we leverage Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite data to provide a current assessment of mangrove extent within the Red Sea region and also explore the effect of spatial resolution on mapping accuracy. We establish that Sentinel-2 provides a more precise spatial record of extent and subsequently use these data together with a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling approach to: i) map the distribution of Red Sea mangrove systems, and ii) identify potential areas for future afforestation. From these current and potential mangrove distribution maps, we then estimate the carbon sequestration rate for the Red Sea (as well as for each bordering country) using a meta-analysis of sequestration values surveyed from the available literature. For the mangrove classification, we obtained mapping accuracies of 98 %, with a total Red Sea mangrove extent estimated at approximately 175 km2. Based on the MaxEnt approach, which used soil physical and environmental variables to identify the key factors limiting mangrove growth and distribution, an area of nearly 410 km2 was identified for potential mangrove afforestation expansion. The factors constraining the potential distribution of mangroves were related to soil physical properties, likely reflecting the low sediment load and limited nutrient input of the Red Sea. The current rate of carbon sequestration was calculated as 1034.09 Â± 180.53 Mg C yrâˆ’1, and the potential sequestration rate as 2424.49 Â± 423.26 Mg C yrâˆ’1. While our results confirm the maintenance of a positive trend in mangrove growth over the last few decades, they also provide the upper bounds on above ground carbon sequestration potential for the Red Sea mangroves.

TI  - Blue Carbon Stock of the Bangladesh Sundarban Mangroves: What could Be the Scenario after a Century?
AB  - The total blue carbon stock of the Bangladesh Sundarban mangroves was evaluated and the probable future status after a century was predicted based on the recent trend of changes in the last 30 years and implementing a hybrid model of Markov Chain and Cellular automata. At present 36.24 Tg C and 54.95 Tg C are stored in the above-ground and below-ground compartments respectively resulting in total blue carbon stock of 91.19 Tg C. According to the prediction 15.88 Tg C would be lost from this region by the year 2115. The low saline species composition classes dominated mainly by Heritiera spp. accounts for the major portion of the carbon sock at present (45.60 Tg C), while the highly saline regions stores only 14.90 Tg C. The prediction shows that after a hundred years almost 22.42 Tg C would be lost from the low saline regions accompanied by an increase of 8.20 Tg C in the high saline regions dominated mainly by Excoecaria sp. and Avicennia spp. The net carbon loss would be due to both mangrove area loss (similar to 510 km(2)) and change in species composition leading to 58.28 Tg of potential CO2 emission within the year 2115.

TI  - Co-benefits of protecting mangroves for biodiversity conservation and carbon storage
AB  - The conservation of ecosystems and their biodiversity has numerous co-benefits, both for local societies and for humankind worldwide. While the co-benefit of climate change mitigation through so called blue carbon storage in coastal ecosystems has raised increasing interest in mangroves, the relevance of multifaceted biodiversity as a driver of carbon storage remains unclear. Sediment salinity, taxonomic diversity, functional diversity and functional distinctiveness together explain 69\%, 69\%, 27\% and 61\% of the variation in above- and belowground plant biomass carbon, sediment organic carbon and total ecosystem carbon storage, respectively, in the Sundarbans Reserved Forest. Functional distinctiveness had the strongest explanatory power for carbon storage, indicating that blue carbon in mangroves is driven by the functional composition of diverse tree assemblages. Protecting and restoring mangrove biodiversity with site-specific dominant species and other species of contrasting functional traits would have the co-benefit of maximizing their capacity for climate change mitigation through increased carbon storage. Conserving mangrove biodiversity has numerous co-benefits, including climate change-mitigation. Here the authors demonstrate that blue carbon storage in mangroves can be best sustained by combining site-specific dominant species with other species with contrasting functional traits.

TI  - Dynamics of extracellular polymeric substances and soil organic carbon with mangrove zonation along a continuous tidal gradient
AB  - The importance of mangroves in blue carbon storage has been widely reported. However, the potential contribution of microbial extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) to the carbon pool is still poorly understood in mangrove ecosystems. Thus, a natural mangrove reserve located in Gaoqiao was chosen to investigate the linkage between microbial EPS and sediment organic carbon. Sequential resin extraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and 16S high-throughput sequencing were employed to determine the variations in EPS and bacterial taxa in different mangrove communities. Both EPS and EPS-C increased significantly with mangrove zonation from seaward to landward, irrespective of the EPS subfractions (colloidal and bound EPS) and components (extracellular protein and polysaccharide). Moreover, both EPS and EPS-C were found to be positively correlated with soil organic carbon. The present data further showed that EPS-C accounted for 1.84~10.69% of TOC in surface sediments. Multiple functional groups (e.g., O-H, N-H, and C=O), which may provide ligands for particle adsorption and complexation, were identified by FTIR. Consistent with the ascend of EPS with mangrove zonation from seaward to landward, the highest transmittance intensity for all functional groups was consistently exhibited in EPS isolated from landward Rhizophoraceae forest. In addition, the present data also indicated an interesting positive linkage between EPS and the abundance of some specific bacterial taxa, such as Rhizobiales, Corynebacteriales, and Gaiellales. In summary, this study claims the importance of EPS in the carbon pool in mangrove ecosystems. The present study may provide a better understanding of the functions of mangroves in carbon stocks.

TI  - Rapid peat development beneath created, maturing mangrove forests: ecosystem changes across a 25-yr chronosequence
AB  - Mangrove forests are among the world's most productive and carbon-rich ecosystems. Despite growing understanding of factors controlling mangrove forest soil carbon stocks, there is a need to advance understanding of the speed of peat development beneath maturing mangrove forests, especially in created and restored mangrove forests that are intended to compensate for ecosystem functions lost during mangrove forest conversion to other land uses. To better quantify the rate of soil organic matter development beneath created, maturing mangrove forests, we measured ecosystem changes across a 25-yr chronosequence. We compared ecosystem properties in created, maturing mangrove forests to adjacent natural mangrove forests. We also quantified site-specific changes that occurred between 2010 and 2016. Soil organic matter accumulated rapidly beneath maturing mangrove forests as sandy soils transitioned to organic-rich soils (peat). Within 25Â yr, a 20-cm deep peat layer developed. The time required for created mangrove forests to reach equivalency with natural mangrove forests was estimated as (1) <15Â yr for herbaceous and juvenile vegetation, (2) ~55Â yr for adult trees, (3) ~25Â yr for the upper soil layer (0â€“10Â cm), and (4) ~45â€“80Â yr for the lower soil layer (10â€“30Â cm). For soil elevation change, the created mangrove forests were equivalent to or surpassed natural mangrove forests within the first 5 yr. A comparison to chronosequence studies from other ecosystems indicates that the rate of soil organic matter accumulation beneath maturing mangrove forests may be among the fastest globally. In most peatland ecosystems, soil organic matter formation occurs slowly (over centuries, millennia); however, these results show that mangrove peat formation can occur within decades. Peat development, primarily due to subsurface root accumulation, enables mangrove forests to sequester carbon, adjust their elevation relative to sea level, and adapt to changing conditions at the dynamic landâ€“ocean interface. In the face of climate change and rising sea levels, coastal managers are increasingly concerned with the longevity and functionality of coastal restoration efforts. Our results advance understanding of the pace of ecosystem development in created, maturing mangrove forests, which can improve predictions of mangrove forest responses to global change and ecosystem restoration.

TI  - Structural equation modelling reveals factors regulating surface sediment organic carbon content and CO2 efflux in a subtropical mangrove
AB  - Mangroves are blue carbon ecosystems that sequester significant carbon but release CO2, and to a lesser extent CH4 from the sediment through oxidation of organic carbon or from overlying water when flooded. Previous studies, e.g. Leopold et al. (2015), have investigated sediment organic carbon (SOC) content and CO2 flux separately, but could not provide a holistic perspective for both components of blue carbon. Based on field data from a mangrove in southeast Queensland, Australia, we used a structural equation model to elucidate (1) the biotic and abiotic drivers of surface SOC (10Â cm) and sediment CO2 flux; (2) the effect of SOC on sediment CO2 flux; and (3) the covariation among the environmental drivers assessed. Sediment water content, the percentage of fine-grained sediment (&lt;Â 63Â Î¼m), surface sediment chlorophyll and light condition collectively drive sediment CO2 flux, explaining 41% of their variation. Sediment water content, the percentage of fine sediment, season, landform setting, mangrove species, sediment salinity and chlorophyll collectively drive surface SOC, explaining 93% of its variance. Sediment water content and the percentage of fine sediment have a negative impact on sediment CO2 flux but a positive effect on surface SOC content, while sediment chlorophyll is a positive driver of both. Surface SOC was significantly higher in Avicennia marina (2994Â Â±Â 186Â gÂ mâˆ’Â 2, meanÂ Â±Â SD) than in Rhizophora stylosa (2383Â Â±Â 209Â gÂ mâˆ’Â 2). SOC was significantly higher in winter (2771Â Â±Â 192Â gÂ mâˆ’Â 2) than in summer (2599Â Â±Â 211Â gÂ mâˆ’Â 2). SOC significantly increased from creek-side (865Â Â±Â 89Â gÂ mâˆ’Â 2) through mid (3298Â Â±Â 137Â gÂ mâˆ’Â 2) to landward (3933Â Â±Â 138Â gÂ mâˆ’Â 2) locations. Sediment salinity was a positive driver of SOC. Sediment CO2 flux without the influence of biogenic structures (crab burrows, aerial roots) averaged 15.4Â mmolÂ mâˆ’Â 2Â dâˆ’Â 1 in A. marina stands under dark conditions, lower than the global average dark flux (61Â mmolÂ mâˆ’Â 2Â dâˆ’Â 1) for mangroves.

TI  - Spatial variability of mangrove primary productivity in the neotropics
AB  - Mangroves are considered one of the most productive ecosystems in the world with significant contributions as carbon sinks in the biosphere. Yet few attempts have been made to assess global patterns in mangrove net primary productivity, except for a few assumptions relating litterfall rates to variation in latitude. We combined geophysical and climatic variables to predict mangrove litterfall rates at continental scale. On a per-area basis, carbon flux in litterfall in the neotropics is estimated at 5 MgC.ha(-1).yr(-1), between 20\% and 50\% higher than previous estimates. Annual carbon fixed in mangrove litterfall in the neotropics is estimated at 11.5 TgC, which suggests that current global litterfall estimates extrapolated from mean reference values may have been underestimated by at least 5\%. About 5.8 TgC of this total carbon fixed in the neotropics is exported to estuaries and coastal oceans, which is nearly 30\% of global carbon export by tides. We provide the first attempt to quantify and map the spatial variability of carbon fixed in litterfall in mangrove forests at continental scale in response to geophysical and climatic environmental drivers. Our results strengthen the global carbon budget for coastal wetlands, providing blue carbon scientists and coastal policy makers with a more accurate representation of the potential of mangroves to offset carbon dioxide emissions.

TI  - Carbon stocks in artificially and naturally regenerated mangrove ecosystems in the Mekong Delta
AB  - Mangrove forests cover a small fraction of the earthâ€™s surface, but contribute disproportionately to ecosystem services, including carbon (C) storage. These forests are being rapidly degraded as demand for economic development grows. In recognition of the multiple benefits of mangrove forests, rehabilitation of degraded forests is being carried out in many regions. This study assesses the potential for restored mangrove forests in Vietnam to sequester and store C, by characterizing two different mangrove restoration areas in the Mekong Delta region. The Can Gio Mangrove Biospheres Reserve (CGMBR) in Ho Chi Minh City was highly degraded during the Vietnam War and was subsequently replanted between 1978 and 1998. The Kien Vang Protection Forest (KVPF) in Ca Mau Province was similarly degraded during the war, but unlike CGMBR, it has experienced natural regeneration over the last 35Â years. We find that vegetation structure between two sites are not different significantly, though CGMBR has richer mangrove species diversity than KVPF. The mean of total ecosystem C stocks in planted mangroves of CGMBR (889Â Â±Â 111Â MgCÂ haâˆ’1) is not significantly different compare to natural regeneration forests of KVPF (844Â Â±Â 58 MgCÂ haâˆ’1). Our findings suggest that after 35Â years, both anthropogenically and naturally regenerated mangroves appear to store similar levels of C. Â© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Coastal wetland restoration is an important activity to achieve greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets, improve water quality, and reach the Sustainable Development Goals. However, many uncertainties remain in connection with achieving, measuring, and reporting success from coastal wetland restoration. We measured levels of carbon (C) abatement and nitrogen (N) removal potential of restored coastal wetlands in subtropical Queensland, Australia. The site was originally a supratidal forest composed of Melaleuca spp. that was cleared and drained in the 1990s for sugarcane production. In 2010, tidal inundation was reinstated, and a mosaic of coastal vegetation (saltmarshes, mangroves, and supratidal forests) emerged. We measured soil GHG fluxes (CH4, N2O, CO2) and sequestration of organic C in the trees and soil to estimate the net C abatement associated with the reference, converted, and restored sites. To assess the influence of restoration on water quality improvement, we measured denitrification and soil N accumulation. We calculated C abatement of 18.5Â Mg CO2âˆ’eq haâˆ’1 yearâˆ’1 when sugarcane land transitioned to supratidal forests, 11.0Â Mg CO2âˆ’eq haâˆ’1 yearâˆ’1 when the land transitioned to mangroves, and 6.2Â Mg CO2âˆ’eq haâˆ’1 yearâˆ’1 when the land transitioned to saltmarshes. The C abatement was due to tree growth, soil accumulation, and reduced N2O emissions due to the cessation of fertilization. Carbon abatement was still positive, even accounting for CH4 emissions, which increased in the wetlands due to flooding and N2O production due to enhanced levels of denitrification. Coastal wetland restoration in this subtropical setting effectively reduces CO2 emissions while providing additional cobenefits, notably water quality improvement. Â© 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Carbon stocks and sequestration potential of Indian mangroves
AB  - Mangrove forest patches and plantations with known age of plantation along both western and eastern coast of India were sampled for estimation of standing biomass and C stocks. A sample plot of 0.1 ha (1000 m2) was laid in each patch depending on the contour of the patch. All woody stems &gt;1 cm dbh were identified, measured for size and heights were estimated qualitatively. Standard vegetation parameters were estimated. Biomass was calculated using allometric equations based on diameter. Rhizophora mucronata was the most abundant species with 26.1% of total abundance. Mean biomass was 69.3 Â± 49.7 t ha-1 (range 4.85-232.8) with wide variation. Mean AGB along the west coast was 72.6 Â± 53.3 and along the east coast was 56.7 Â± 30.5. They are not significantly different. The estimated biomass of Indian mangroves was found to be 41.2 million tons which is about 0.46% of total biomass of the Indian forests. Importance of mangrove forest along with carbon sequestration and other ecological services is discussed. Â© International Society for Tropical Ecology.

TI  - MANGROVE BLUE CARBON IN THE FACE OF DEFORESTATION, CLIMATE CHANGE, AND RESTORATION
AB  - Coastal wetlands have disproportionately high carbon densities, known as blue carbon, compared to most terrestrial ecosystems. Mangroves and their blue carbon stocks are at risk globally from land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) activities such as aquaculture, alongside biophysical disturbances such as sea-level rise and cyclones. Global estimates of carbon emissions from mangrove loss have been previously unable to differentiate between the variable impacts of different drivers of loss. This article discusses the impacts that different LULCC activities and biophysical disturbances have on carbon stocks (biomass and soil) and greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2 and CH4). The dynamics of carbon stocks and fluxes depends on the type of LULCC; aquaculture often results in biomass and soil carbon removal, and some forms of agriculture can substantially increase methane emissions. Natural disturbances have mixed impacts on mangrove carbon; sea-level rise will drown some mangroves and their carbon stocks but provide opportunities for new carbon accumulation, while cyclones can have immediate negative impacts on stocks but positive impacts on sequestration during recovery. Mangrove rehabilitation practices can actively restore carbon stocks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from previous land uses. It is critical to consider the type of LULCC when estimating carbon emissions due to mangrove loss or rehabilitation. Mangrove blue carbon is now high on the international conservation policy agenda, and a better understanding of how carbon stocks and fluxes respond to anthropogenic and biophysical disturbance may provide better incentives for mangrove conservation and sustainable management.

TI  - Potential of stock carbon in mangrove Sonneratia alba in Passo coastal waters, Inner Ambon Bay
AB  - The increase in CO2 in the air has caused global warming, the impact of which is felt by everyone in the world. One way to control climate change is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by maintaining the integrity of natural forests and increasing the density of trees outside the forest. Mangrove forests have a role as absorbers of CO2 from the air, and save more carbon than most tropical rainforests. The purpose of this study was to determine the biomass, stock carbon and CO2 uptake of mangrove Sonneratia alba in the Passo coastal waters, Inner Ambon Bay. Sampling of mangrove S. albaby belt transect method with a belt width of 10 m. Data collected included the number of trees, diameter (DBH) and area of observation. Biomass analysis and carbon content of S. albatrees were carried out in a nondestructive way (without damaging plants), which was using biomass estimation allometric equations. Carbon (CO2) uptakein S. alba is 564.48 tons.ha-1 which is stored on above of the ground at 111.50 tons.ha-1 and below the ground at 42.31 tons.ha-1. Total stock carbon of 153.81 tons.ha-1 were converted from total biomass of 327.26 tons.ha-1. High carbon sequestration and storage is supported by high biomass and high biomass is supported by a high number and diameter of trees. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Including GHG emissions from mangrove forests LULUC in LCA: a case study on shrimp farming in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam
AB  - Mangrove forests have been recognized as important regulators of greenhouse gases (GHGs), yet the resulting land use and land-use change (LULUC) emissions have rarely been accounted for in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies. The present study therefore presents up-to-date estimates for GHG emissions from mangrove LULUC and applies them to a case study of shrimp farming in Vietnam. To estimate the global warming impacts of mangrove LULUC, a combination of the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines, the Net Committed Emissions, and the Missed Potential Carbon Sink method were used. A literature review was then conducted to characterize the most critical parameters for calculating carbon losses, missed sequestration, methane fluxes, and dinitrogen monoxide emissions. Our estimated LUC emissions from mangrove deforestation resulted in 124 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1), assuming IPCC's recommendations of 1 m of soil loss, and 96\% carbon oxidation. In addition to this, 1.25 t of carbon would no longer be sequestered annually. Discounted over 20 years, this resulted in total LULUC emissions of 129 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) (CV = 0.441, lognormal distribution (ln)). Shrimp farms in the Mekong Delta, however, can today operate for 50 years or more, but are 1.5 m deep (50\% oxidation). In addition to this, Asian tiger shrimp farming in mixed mangrove concurrent farms (the only type of shrimp farm that resulted in mangrove deforestation since 2000 in our case study) resulted in 533 kg methane and 1.67 kg dinitrogen monoxide per hectare annually. Consequently, the LULUC GHG emissions resulted in 184 and 282 t CO2-eq t(-1) live shrimp at farm gate, using mass and economic allocation, respectively. These GHG emissions are about an order of magnitude higher than from semi-intensive or intensive shrimp farming systems. Limitations in data quality and quantity also led us to quantify the uncertainties around our emission estimates, resulting in a CV of between 0.4 and 0.5. Our results reinforce the urgency of conserving mangrove forests and the need to quantify uncertainties around LULUC emissions. It also questions mixed mangrove concurrent shrimp farming, where partial removal of mangrove forests is endorsed based upon the benefits of partial mangrove conservation and maintenance of certain ecosystem services. While we recognize that these activities limit the chances of complete removal, our estimates show that large GHG emissions from mangrove LULUC question the sustainability of this type of shrimp farming, especially since mixed mangrove farming only provide 5\% of all farmed shrimp produced in Vietnam.

TI  - Ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 exchange from semiarid mangroves in the Gulf of California
AB  - Mangrove wetlands play an essential role as blue carbon ecosystems. However, worldwide they also face imminent threats caused by anthropogenic activities and climate change. Mangroves in the semiarid region of the Gulf of California are highly vulnerable to both threats. In this study, we present eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE), gross primary productivity (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (Reco) at a preserved mangrove (Estero El Sargento) and a site influenced by anthropogenic activities (Bahia del Tobari) located in northwest Mexico. Both sites were net annual carbon sinks but had different dynamics. The net annual carbon gain for Estero El Sargento was-717 g C m- 2 y-1 while for Bahia deTobari was-247 g C m- 2 y-1. Over the studied year, Estero El Sargento had lower Reco(329 g C m- 2) during the winter-spring months and an overall lower annual Reco/GPP (0.42) than Bahia de Tobari. The Reco was notably high during the winter-spring period at Bahia de Tobari when agriculture drainage from the intensive food production activities at the Yaqui Valley reaches the bay. The contrasting NEE patterns and magnitude between both mangrove sites suggest that anthropogenic activities influencing coastal ecosystems exert an important control on the CO2 sink potential.

TI  - Carbon burial and storage in tropical salt marshes under the influence of sea level rise
AB  - Coastal vegetated habitats can be important sinks of organic carbon (Corg) and mitigate global warming by sequestering significant quantities of atmospheric CO2 and storing sedimentary Corg for long periods, although their Corg burial and storage capacity may be affected by on-going sea level rise and human intervention. Geochemical data from published 210Pb-dated sediment cores, collected from low-energy microtidal coastal wetlands in El Salvador (Jiquilisco Bay) and in Mexico (Salada Lagoon; Estero de Urias Lagoon; Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve) were revisited to assess temporal changes (within the last 100 years) of Corg concentrations, storage and burial rates in tropical salt marshes under the influence of sea level rise and contrasting anthropization degree. Grain size distribution was used to identify hydrodynamic changes, and Î´13C to distinguish terrigenous sediments from those accumulated under the influence of marine transgression. Although the accretion rate ranges in all sediment records were comparable, Corg concentrations (0.2â€“30%), stocks (30â€“465 Mg haâˆ’1, by extrapolation to 1 m depth), and burial rates (3â€“378 g mâˆ’2 yearâˆ’1) varied widely within and among the study areas. However, in most sites sea level rise decreased Corg concentrations and stocks in sediments, but increased Corg burial rates. Lower Corg concentrations were attributed to the input of reworked marine particles, which contribute with a lower amount of Corg than terrigenous sediments; whereas higher Corg burial rates were driven by higher mass accumulation rates, influenced by increased flooding and human interventions in the surroundings. Corg accumulation and long-term preservation in tropical salt marshes can be as high as in mangrove or temperate salt marsh areas and, besides the reduction of Corg stocks by ongoing sea level rise, the disturbance of the long-term buried Corg inventories might cause high CO2 releases, for which they must be protected as a part of climate change mitigation efforts.

TI  - Limits on carbon sequestration in arid blue carbon ecosystems
AB  - Coastal ecosystems produce and sequester significant amounts of carbon ("blue carbon"), which has been well documented in humid and semi-humid regions of temperate and tropical climates but less so in arid regions where mangroves, marshes, and seagrasses exist near the limit of their tolerance for extreme temperature and salinity. To better understand these unique systems, we measured whole-ecosystem carbon stocks in 58 sites across the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in natural and planted mangroves, salt marshes, seagrass beds, microbial mats, and coastal sabkha (inter- and supratidal unvegetated salt flats). Natural mangroves held significantly more carbon in above- and belowground biomass than other vegetated ecosystems. Planted mangrove carbon stocks increased with age, but there were large differences for sites of similar age. Soil carbon varied widely across sites (2-367 Mg C/ha), with ecosystem averages that ranged from 49 to 156 Mg C/ha. For the first time, microbial mats were documented to contain soil carbon pools comparable to vascular plant-dominated ecosystems, and could arguably be recognized as a unique blue carbon ecosystem. Total ecosystem carbon stocks ranged widely from 2 to 515 Mg C/ha (seagrass bed and mangrove, respectively). Seagrass beds had the lowest carbon stock per unit area, but the largest stock per total area due to their large spatial coverage. Compared to similar ecosystems globally, mangroves and marshes in the UAE have lower plant and soil carbon stocks; however, the difference in soil stocks is far larger than with plant stocks. This incongruent difference between stocks is likely due to poor carbon preservation under conditions of weakly reduced soils (200-350 mV), coarse-grained sediments, and active shoreline migration. This work represents the first attempt to produce a country-wide coastal ecosystem carbon accounting using a uniform sampling protocol, and was motivated by specific policy goals identified by the Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative. These carbon stock data supported two objectives: to quantify carbon stocks and infer sequestration capacity in arid blue carbon ecosystems, and to explore the potential to incorporate blue carbon science into national reporting and planning documents.

TI  - A novel approach for estimation of aboveground biomass of a carbon-rich mangrove site in India
AB  - Mangroves can play a crucial part in climate change mitigation policies due to their high carbon-storing capacity. However, the carbon sequestration potential of Indian mangroves generally remained unexplored to date. In this study, multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and 2 data-derived variables were used to estimate the AGB of a tropical carbon-rich mangrove forest of India. Ensemble prediction of multiple machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosted Model (GBM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), were used for AGB prediction. The multi-temporal dataset was used in two different ways to find the most suitable method of using them. The results of the analysis showed that the modeling field measured AGB with individual date data values results in estimates with root mean square errors (RMSE) ranging from 149.242 t/ha for XGB to 151.149 t/ha for the RF. Modeling AGB with the average and percentile metrics of the multi-temporal image stack improves the prediction accuracy of AGB, with RMSE ranging from 81.882 t/ha for the XGB to 74.493 t/ha for the RF. The AGB modeling using ensemble prediction showed further improvement in accuracy with an RMSE of 72.864 t/ha and normalized RMSE of 11.38%. In this study, the intra-seasonal variation of Sentinel-1 and 2 data for mangrove ecosystems was explored for the first time. The variations in remotely sensed variables could be attributed mainly to soil moisture availability and rainfall in the mangrove ecosystem. The efficiency of Sentinel-1 and 2 data-derived variables and ensemble prediction of machine learning models for Indian mangroves were also explored for the first time. The methodologies established in this study can be used in the future for accurate prediction and repeated monitoring of AGB for mangrove ecosystems. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Causes and effects of mangrove ecosystem damage on carbon stocks and absorption in East Java, Indonesia
AB  - The mangrove ecosystems in East Java are widely exploited and converted for other land. Mangrove forests help decrease carbon dioxide concentration, are very efficient carbon sinks and store them in large quantities in biomass and sediments for a long time. This paper tries to understand the causes and effects of mangroves ecosystem damage on carbon stocks and absorption, with East Java, Indonesia as a case study. The Driver, Pressure, State, Impact and Response (DPSIR) framework, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and Partial Least Squares (PLS) used to identify and solve these problems. The result shows that the destruction of mangrove forests in East Java has occurred due to land conversion intensification. Accordingly, the mangrovesâ€™ average carbon sequestration and storage in East Java can be classified as moderate to low. Illegal logging is the leading cause, so there needs to be a clear policy that involves the government and the community. This result suggests that forming a strategy to prevent illegal logging and increase carbon sequestration and storage must be carried out, and community engagement in decision-making processes to protect and manage the mangrove forests.

TI  - Biomass accumulation and carbon storage of four different aged Sonneratia apetala plantations in Southern China
AB  - The objectives of this study were to examine plant biomass accumulation and carbon (C) storage in four different aged Sonneratia apetala plantations in the Leizhou Bay in South China. The allometric equations using diameter at breast height (DBH) and height (H) were developed to quantify plant biomass. The total forest biomass (TFB) of S. apetala plantation at 4, 5, 8, and 10 years old was 47.9, 71.7, 95.9, and 108.1 Mg ha(-1), respectively. The forest biomass C storage in aboveground (AGB) and roots at 4, 5, 8, and 10-year plantation was 19.9, 32.6, 42.0, 49.0 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Soil organic C (SOC) on the top 20 cm of sediments increased by 0.3, 6.8, 27.4, and 35.0 Mg ha(-1)after 4, 5, 8, and 10 years of reforestation, respectively. The average annual rate of total carbon storage (TCS) accumulation at 4, 5, 8, and 10-year S. apetala plantation was 5.0, 7.9, 8.7, and 8.4 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The TCS values in this study were underestimated because we only estimated SOC storage on the top 20-cm sediments in these plantations. This study suggests these young S. apetala plantations have the characteristics of fast growth, high biomass accumulation, and high C storage capacity, especially in sediments. They sequestrated C at a high but varying rate over time. The large-scale reforestation of S. apetala plantations in the open coastal mudflats in southern China has great potential to sequestrate more C as well as restore the degraded coastal land. The potential ecological issues associated with the increasing monoculture plantations were discussed. More long-term monitoring and research are needed to further evaluate biomass and C accumulation of S. apetala plantations over time as well as how the increasing distribution of this monoculture plantation will influence the few native mangrove remnants.

TI  - Natural and Regenerated Saltmarshes Exhibit Similar Soil and Belowground Organic Carbon Stocks, Root Production and Soil Respiration
AB  - Saltmarshes provide many valuable ecosystem services including storage of a large amount of `blue carbon' within their soils. To date, up to 50\% of the world's saltmarshes have been lost or severely degraded primarily due to a variety of anthropogenic pressures. Previous efforts have aimed to restore saltmarshes and their ecosystem functions, but the success of these efforts is rarely evaluated. To fill this gap, we used a range of metrics, including organic carbon stocks, root production, soil respiration and microbial communities to compare natural and a 20-year restoration effort in saltmarsh habitats within the Sydney Olympic Park in New South Wales, Australia. We addressed four main questions: (1) Have above- and belowground plant biomass recovered to natural levels? (2) Have organic carbon stocks of soils recovered? (3) Are microbial communities similar between natural and regenerated saltmarshes? and (4) Are microbial communities at both habitats associated to ecosystem characteristics? For both soil organic carbon stocks and belowground biomass, we found no significant differences between natural and regenerated habitats (F-(1,F-14) = 0.47, p = 0.5; F-(1,F-42) = 0.08, p = 0.76). Aboveground biomass was higher in the natural habitat compared to the regenerated habitat (F-(1,F-20) = 27.3, p < 0.0001), which may result from a site-specific effect: protection from erosion offered by a fringing mangrove forest in the natural habitat but not the regenerated habitat. Our microbial community assessment indicated that restored and natural saltmarsh habitats were similar at a phylum level, with the exception of a higher proportion of Proteobacteria in the rhizosphere of saltmarshes from the regenerated habitat (p < 0.01). Abundance of both Desulfuromonas and Geobacter was associated with high carbon and nitrogen densities in soils indicating that these genera may be key for the recovery of ecosystem characteristics in saltmarshes. Our restored and natural saltmarsh soils store at 30 cm depth similar levels of organic carbon: 47.9 Mg OC ha(-1) to 64.6 Mg OC ha(-1). Conservation of urban saltmarshes could be important for `blue carbon' programmes aimed at mitigating atmospheric carbon dioxide.

TI  - Multi-sensor satellite data for carbon storage mapping of green space in a fast growing development corridor in Malaysia
AB  - Disturbances such as deforestation and land use change on natural vegetation have caused carbon dioxide (CO2) emission to the atmosphere which contributes to global warming and climate change. Malaysia has started to take necessary steps to mitigate the potential impact of increased CO2 and integrating the green infrastructure into urban planning is a way to go. Green space in urban environment provides a variety of benefits to the community by sequestrating carbon, absorbing urban emissions and producing oxygen. In this study we quantified the carbon storage capacity of various green spaces, namely forests, mangroves and urban parks by biometric measurements and remote sensing techniques at a rapidly developing economy region in Iskandar Malaysia (IM) in the southern Peninsular Malaysia that covers an area of 2,217 km2. Satellite imageries such as RapidEye and Advanced Land Observing Satellite phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) were used for mapping the carbon content of different vegetation in IM. The spatial distribution of carbon storage shows that mangroves contribute the largest amount of carbon storage in IM with 0.437M t C and this is mainly due to their vast area (8382 ha). This is followed by tropical forest (0.185M t C). However, tropical forest has the highest carbon density with 161.7 tC ha-1 compared to mangroves (52.1 tC ha-1). In general, trees in urban parks have lower carbon storage (ranging between 32.63 tC ha-1 to 48.81 tC ha-1) compared to forests and mangrove. In total, these vegetation types in IM remove âˆ¼2.29 M tCO2eq. Green space in IM was found to remove about 3% of carbon emitted to the air in IM. These results suggest that the government must make firm policies to increase more green cover in the urban areas and to preserve the existing green space for improving environmental quality for people and supporting biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Tree biomass and carbon stock of a community-managed mangrove forest in Bohol, Philippines
AB  - Mangrove plays a significant role in climate change mitigation particularly in carbon absorption and minimizing the detrimental impacts of sea level rise, salt-water intrusion and tidal surges. In Bohol Province, Philippines, a small coastal island community known as Banacon is one of the successful cases in mangrove reforestation. Recognizing the siteâ€™s potential for a carbon sequestration project, a biomass and carbon stock assessment of mangrove trees was done. Using standard sampling techniques and allometric equations, tree carbon storage was measured across stand ages, namely 15-, 20- and 40-year-old plantations. Mature natural stands were also included in the assessment. By estimate, the 40-year-old plantation has the largest carbon density with 370.7 ton ha-1, followed by the 15-year-old plantation with 208.5 ton ha-1, 20-year-old plantation with 149.5 ton ha-1, and lastly by natural stand with 145.6 ton ha-1. Overall, Banacon mangroves are in a vigorous condition of storing vast amount of carbon. Local community and government should therefore sustain their commitment in coastal reforestation activities in order to enhance the mangrove carbon stocks. Policies and programs that can help provide incentives and livelihoods to local people who are largely dependent on mangroves should likewise be explored in order to sustainably reap the economic and ecological benefits of conserving mangrove forest.

TI  - Analyzing the efficacy of subtropical urban forests in offsetting carbon emissions from cities
AB  - Urban forest management and policies have been promoted as a tool to mitigate carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions. This study used existing CO(2) reduction measures from subtropical Miami-Dade and Gainesville, USA and modeled carbon storage and sequestration by trees to analyze policies that use urban forests to offset carbon emissions. Field data were analyzed, modeled, and spatially analyzed to compare CO(2) sequestered by managing urban forests to equivalent amounts of CO(2) emitted in both urban areas. Urban forests in Gainesville have greater tree density, store more carbon and present lower per-tree sequestration rates than Miami-Dade as a result of environmental conditions and urbanization patterns. Areas characterized by natural pine-oak forests, mangroves, and stands of highly invasive trees were most apt at sequestering CO(2). Results indicate that urban tree sequestration offsets CO(2) emissions and, relative to total city-wide emissions, is moderately effective at 3.4 percent and 1.8 percent in Gainesville and Miami-Dade, respectively. Moreover, converting available non-treed areas into urban forests would not increase overall CO(2) emission reductions substantially. Current CO(2) sequestration by trees was comparable to implemented CO(2) reduction policies. However, long-term objectives, multiple ecosystem services, costs, community needs, and preservation of existing forests should be considered when managing trees for climate change mitigation and other ecosystem services.

TI  - Methane emissions partially offset ``blue carbon{''} burial in mangroves
AB  - Organic matter burial in mangrove forests results in the removal and long-term storage of atmospheric CO2, so-called ``blue carbon.{'' However, some of this organic matter is metabolized and returned to the atmosphere as CH4. Because CH4 has a higher global warming potential than the CO2 fixed in the organic matter, it can offset the CO2 removed via carbon burial. We provide the first estimate of the global magnitude of this offset. Our results show that high CH4 evasion rates have the potential to partially offset blue carbon burial rates in mangrove sediments on average by 20\% (sensitivity analysis offset range, 18 to 22\%) using the 20-year global warming potential. Hence, mangrove sediment and water CH4 emissions should be accounted for in future blue carbon assessments.

TI  - Bio remediation of CO2 and characterization of carbonic Anhydrase from mangrove bacteria
AB  - Increasing Carbon Dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has aggravated the threats of global warming and global diversity loss. To decrease CO2 emission, various physical and chemical based strategies are used to store and sequester CO2. The biomimmetic approach is one of the available harmless, robust and eco-friendly approach but still less evaluated. The present study reports the role of microbial intracellular carbonic anhydrase in the formation of calcite and sequestration of CO2 by bacteria. Bacterial carbonic anhydrase was screened from Bacillus altitudinis, isolated from the mangrove forest of the western coastline of India. The isolate was able to grow optimally at 2.5% CO2 saturated environment. The enzyme was found to catalyze the reaction in a wide range of pH and temperature with an optimum at 7.5 pH and 30Â°C temperature. The enzyme was reported to accelerate the hydration of CO2 in 50 mM ZnCl2. Furthermore the enzyme remained active and shown the remarkable activity with sulphanilamide inhibitor, in vitro calcite encrust formation activity was tested using growth media supplemented with CaCl2. Product of sequestration, Calcite, can be used as raw material for building construction. Â© 2014 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

TI  - Accounting for black carbon lowers estimates of blue carbon storage services
AB  - The canopies and roots of seagrass, mangrove, and saltmarsh protect a legacy of buried sedimentary organic carbon from resuspension and remineralisation. This legacy's value, in terms of mitigating anthropogenic emissions of CO, is based on total organic carbon (TOC) inventories to a depth likely to be disturbed. However, failure to subtract allochthonous recalcitrant carbon overvalues the storage service. Simply put, burial of oxidation-resistant organics formed outside of the ecosystem provides no additional protection from remineralisation. Here, we assess whether black carbon (BC), an allochthonous and recalcitrant form of organic carbon, is contributing to a significant overestimation of blue carbon stocks. To test this supposition, BC and TOC contents were measured in different types of seagrass and mangrove sediment cores across tropical and temperate regimes, with different histories of air pollution and fire together with a reanalysis of published data from a subtropical system. The results suggest current carbon stock estimates are positively biased, particularly for low-organic-content sandy seagrass environs, by 18 Â± 3% (Â±95% confidence interval) and 43 Â± 21% (Â±95% CI) for the temperate and tropical regions respectively. The higher BC fractions appear to originate from atmospheric deposition and substantially enrich the relatively low TOC fraction within these environs. Â© 2018 The Author(s).
