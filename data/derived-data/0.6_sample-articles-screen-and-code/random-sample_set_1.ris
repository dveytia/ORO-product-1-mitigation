TI  - Lightning energy conversion using lasers
AB  - Potential energy sources are being investigated for the socioeconomic needs and increased power demand. Systems employing nuclear, thermal, hydro, solar, volcano, MHD, tidal and wind power generation techniques already exist. This work describes our attempt to utilize the off-planet lightning charge to store super electrolytic batteries or super capacitors. The electrostatic charge on clouds can be shifted to earth through a conductive air plasma channel created by appropriate high power Q-Switched and mode-locked laser. The pulsed laser may create a conducting path consisting of ionized air particles from earth to some upper atmosphere. An antenna connected to anode of super cell or positive terminal of the super capacitor will accumulate and store this charge for future use. The anode of battery or positive terminal of capacitor may be connected to earth to complete the circuit. Due to extremely aloud thundering and tropical weather severity a detailed work was done on lightning regarding its temporal and spatial profiles to develop a reasonable model to explore transient charging characteristics. Experimental work in respect of laser inducted plasma wire creation and charging capabilities of super storage batteries or super capacitors is optimized. Latest experimental results are reported.

TI  - Comparison of hydro-environmental impacts for ebb-only and two-way generation for the severn barrage
AB  - The Severn Estuary located between South Wales and South West England has a tidal range of around 14 m which makes it the third highest tidal range in the world. With marine renewable energy becoming more significant in many parts of the world, due to its predictable nature and the increasing cost of natural resources, there have been a number of proposals for various marine renewable energy schemes to be built in the estuary, including several tidal barrages. The Cardiff-Weston (or Severn) barrage is considered to be one of the most favourable of these proposals. This barrage, which will be the world's biggest tidal renewable energy scheme if built, will have a significant environmental and ecological impact on the estuary, whilst generating about 5% of the UK's electricity. This study mainly focuses on investigating the hydro-environmental and ecological impacts of the proposed barrage by modelling the structure using linked 1-D/2-D hydro-environmental models with the capability of modelling several key environmental and ecological processes. To investigate the importance of the different operational schemes on the environmental and ecological impacts, a two-way generation scheme was also used in this study as well as the commonly investigated ebb-only generation scheme.

TI  - A tube-shaped solid-liquid-interfaced triboelectric-electromagnetic hybrid nanogenerator for efficient ocean wave energy harvesting
AB  - Ocean waves, the most widely distributed energy source within the marine environment, promise renewable energy for next-generation self-sufficient ocean exploration and monitoring instrumentation. Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) technology has shown the potential in harvesting ocean wave energy. However, most TENG designs suffer from challenges such as relatively low contact intimacy and energy power density, limiting their practical application. This paper proposes a solid-liquid-interfaced, tube-shaped tribo-electric-electromagnetic hybrid nanogenerator (TTEHG) to efficiently capture wave energy. Owing to the sol-id-liquid interface in conjunction with the coupled TENG and the electromagnetic generator (EMG) design, the TTEHG features a reduced frictional loss and broadened range of harvestable wave energy. At a frequency of 1 Hz, the instantaneous power density and current density of the TTEHG are 0.25 mW.cm(-3) and 5 mA.cm(-3), respectively. Even at an ultra-low operational frequency of 0.2 Hz, the TTEHG exhibits an excellent output performance with a peak current of nearly 15 mA, and is able to power various functional electronic devices, such as temperature and humidity sensors, to monitor the marine environment. The TTEHG was deployed in Sanya Bay, China, to demonstrate its practical application in harsh ocean environments.

TI  - Climate change issues on the Pacific Islands: An overview
AB  - This paper sets a context for the theme of KLIMA 2012 by outlining the key issues of climate change as it affects the Pacific Islands. The paper describes projected biophysical impacts and the social issues they raise for Pacific Islanders. These issues are particularly acute for the low-lying atoll countries, whose continued existence is threatened by sea level rise. Most Pacific Island countries have populations concentrated in coastal areas, and have few financial or technical resourcesâ€”all of which factors make them particularly vulnerable to climate change. Although Pacific Island countries are all striving to decrease their use of fossil fuels, including by greater use of renewable energy to save import costs, the intent is also to set an example to the large industrialised countries and to influence them to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, which are causing climate change. However, as global GHG emissions continue to rise, adaptation to climate change is essential for the sustainable development of the Pacific Islands. Â© 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Evaluating an Inland Waterway Cargo Vessel's Energy Efficiency Indices
AB  - Although the International Maritime Organization (IMO) introduced the energy efficiency requirements for ships more than a decade ago, to date, inland navigation has not been affected by corresponding regulations at all. Therefore, inland waterway vessels are left with no mandatory requirements that could push their technology into more energy efficient design. Fortunately, there are certain pioneering attempts to define energy efficiency criteria for inland vessels. This paper tries to gather and provide a review of such methods. Moreover, a typical Danube cargo inland vessel's data are used to evaluate their current energy efficiency levels with respect to provisional criteria. Consequently, two methods are found and used here. They are both based on IMO's energy efficiency concept but modified for the inland waterway vessels. The methods delivered a significant difference in applicability and were difficult to compare. Moreover, shallow and deep-water effects are explored in the same regard but provided unsound conclusions. The final results displayed discrepancies in energy efficiency levels for the same vessels and so the methodology should be improved and harmonised, if it is to be introduced as mandatory for inland waterway vessels. The analysis provided a glimpse into the current condition of the traditional design of the Danube inland fleet, with respect to the emerging energy efficiency policies.

TI  - Chassis mounted single stage impulse turbine for wind energy harvesting on a cruising transport vehicle
AB  - Fossil fuels have been a means of energy source since a long time, and have tended to the needs of the large global population. These conventional sources are bound to deplete in the near future and hence there is a need for producing energy from renewable energy sources like solar, wind, geothermal, tidal etc. Technologies involving renewable energy are a growing subject of concern. The problem is the excessive pollution caused by conventional sources of energy and their impact on the environment. In particular, one of the main sources of pollution is harmful gases emitting out of automobiles. Wind energy is one among the renewable energy sources which is implemented in large scale energy production. A large amount of research has been done in this field to harness energy and power houses and other amenities are nearby wind farms. The purpose of this study is to consider the use of wind energy along with conventional energy sources to power automobiles. Specifically the concept of an impulse turbine mounted on the chassis of a typical vehicle structure is considered. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used to validate the concept and also come up with a design that maximizes energy generation by such turbines.

TI  - Flow curvature effects on dynamic behaviour of a novel vertical axis tidal current turbine: Numerical and experimental analysis
AB  - This paper presents a summary of the work done by the authors regarding the design, construction and test of vertical axis hydro turbines to exploit tidal currents. Double Multiple Streamtube (DMS) model and Vortex model have been used to predict turbines performances either with fixed blades or with self-acting variable pitch blades. Within the DMS model, VAWT and VAWT\_dyn codes have been developed to analyze steady and dynamic performances; within Vortex model, VAT-VOR3D code has been developed. Theoretical analysis and numerical predicted performances have been compared and validated with experimental test results on both model and real scale turbines. A comparison between DMS and Vortex model results has been presented. Moreover, the recent activities in terms of numerical investigations on the flow curvature effects are presented.

TI  - Molecular and physiological evidence of genetic assimilation to high CO2 in the marine nitrogen fixer Trichodesmium
AB  - Most investigations of biogeochemically important microbes have focused on plastic (short-term) phenotypic responses in the absence of genetic change, whereas few have investigated adaptive (longterm) responses. However, no studies to date have investigated the molecular progression underlying the transition from plasticity to adaptation under elevated CO2 for a marine nitrogen-fixer. To address this gap, we cultured the globally important cyanobacterium Trichodesmium at both low and high CO2 for 4.5 y, followed by reciprocal transplantation experiments to test for adaptation. Intriguingly, fitness actually increased in all high-CO2 adapted cell lines in the ancestral environment upon reciprocal transplantation. By leveraging coordinated phenotypic and transcriptomic profiles, we identified expression changes and pathway enrichments that rapidly responded to elevated CO2 and were maintained upon adaptation, providing strong evidence for genetic assimilation. These candidate genes and pathways included those involved in photosystems, transcriptional regulation, cell signaling, carbon/nitrogen storage, and energy metabolism. Conversely, significant changes in specific sigma factor expression were only observed upon adaptation. These data reveal genetic assimilation as a potentially adaptive response of Trichodesmium and importantly elucidate underlying metabolic pathways paralleling the fixation of the plastic phenotype upon adaptation, thereby contributing to the few available data demonstrating genetic assimilation in microbial photoautotrophs. These molecular insights are thus critical for identifying pathways under selection as drivers in plasticity and adaptation.

TI  - Tidal current energy. origins and challenges
AB  - This chapter introduces the forces that drive the tidal currents and the external variables that modify their behavior, and outlines the challenges faced by engineers in exploiting this worldwide resource. It outlines the underpinning astronomical and meteorological mechanisms that drive tidal currents, and the topographical features that modify and intensify the resulting flows. Tidal currents are not well-behaved, bidirectional laminar flows; they are predictable, but flow behavior at certain points within the cycle may make power extraction very challenging or even impossible. For the commercial generation of power, tidal current devices need to be simple and cost-effective to install, requiring minimal maintenance and able to resist the build-up of biofouling for long periods of time. The exploitation of tidal current power is too attractive to ignore, and the UK has an abundance of resource in this field, but a much more coherent effort is required to make it realistically possible. The UK's position as the global leader in research and development in this field still holds, but only just; historically incoherent and diffuse funding has tended to create an unfocused development effort that has produced a large number of turbine proposals, very few of which have actually been tested at sea. The chapter highlights the range of factors that affect tidal current behavior, the existence of unpredictability within a highly predictable system, and the basic difficulties of cost-effective anchorage and fixing.

TI  - Seismic imaging of an active fluid conduit below Scanner Pockmark, Central North Sea
AB  - Subsurface CO2 storage is a key strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emission, but leakage of CO2 along natural fluid pathways may affect storage formation integrity. However, the internal structure and the physical properties of these focused fluid conduits are poorly understood. Here, we present a three-dimensional seismic velocity model of an active fluid conduit beneath the Scanner Pockmark in the Central North Sea, derived from ocean-bottom seismometer data. We show that the conduit, which manifests as a pipe structure in seismic data, is separated into two parts. The upper part, extending to 260 m depth, i.e. 110 m below the seafloor, is characterised by seismic velocities up to 100 m/s slower than the surrounding strata. The deeper part is characterized by a 50 m/s seismic velocity increase compared to background velocity. We suggest that the upper part of the pipe structure represents a network of open fractures, partly filled with free gas, while the reason for the velocity increase in the lower part remains speculative. These observations suggest that active pipes can be internally heterogeneous with some intervals probably being open fluid pathways and other intervals being closed. This study highlights the complexity in evaluating focused fluid conduits and the necessity of their detailed assessment when selecting CO2 storage sites. Â© 2021

TI  - Opportunities for cross-fertilisation between the shipbuilding industry and the emergent offshore wind energy sector in Colombia: an overview of floating platformtechnologies
AB  - Introduction: This paper provides a review and analysis of cross-fertilisation opportunities between the shipbuilding industry in Colombia and the Offshore Wind Energy (OWE) sector. Problem: In Colombia, offshore wind resources are available, so it is necessary to analyse the potential areas where national shipbuilding industries could take advantage of their knowledge and experience for the development of OWE projects. Objective: The study is aimed at identifying the main aspects involved in the design and construction of floating platforms for Offshore Wind Turbines (OWTs) and to examine the restrictions and capabilities of the Colombian shipbuilding industry for their implementation. Methodology: A review of the technical aspects related to Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWTs) and the integration of shipyards with the OWE value chain was carried out; subsequently, cross-fertilisation opportunities between the shipbuilding industry in Colombia and the OWE sector were analysed and discussed. Results: There are multiple areas in which the shipbuilding industry in Colombia could participate in the value chain of the floating offshore wind energy sector in Colombia, taking advantage of the knowledge and experience in topics such as shipbuilding, marine engineering, steelmaking, and construction techniques. Conclusion: The Colombian shipbuilding industry could enter new R\&D areas derived from OWE projects, while its most significant contribution would be its experience for the design and construction of vessels for the installation, operation and maintenance of FOWTs. Originality: Through this investigation, the correlation between the Colombian shipbuilding industry and the emerging OWE market is identified. Limitations: At an international level, FOWTs are under development and testing. In the national context, currently, there is not an established OWE sector.

TI  - Blade design and optimization of a horizontal axis tidal turbine
AB  - Tidal turbine is a device which converts the kinetic energy of water into electric energy. The blade element momentum theory (BEM) is used to design the blade in this paper. Although tidal power resources are abundant, the actual operation of hydraulic turbines is not very good due to the limitations of turbine conversion efficiency and production cost. Therefore, this paper establishes a neural network model for variables and objective functions, and then applies multi-objective optimization algorithm to genetic optimization of the power coefficient, the main index of hydraulic performance of tidal turbines. The optimized results are verified by model test and sea trial. The results show that after optimizing the blade chord length distribution and pitch Angle distribution, the power coefficient of the turbine increases by 2%, and the optimal tip speed ratio range is also expanded, which is more conducive to the actual tidal turbine power generation, and has certain engineering significance.

TI  - Stabilization of carbon in mineral soils from mangroves of the Sinu river delta, Colombia
AB  - Mangrove forests of the Sinu river delta in Cispata bay, Colombia, show large differences in soil carbon storage between fringe (oceanic) and basin (estuarine) mangroves. We were interested in testing whether these differences in soil carbon are associated with sediment transport processes or whether most of the carbon is produced in situ within the mangrove system. Given past sedimentation dynamics of the Sinu river, we hypothesized that a large portion of soil carbon in basin mangroves is due to sedimentation. We determined total organic carbon content (TOC) as 660.93 +/- 259.18 MgC ha(-1) for basin soils up to a sampling depth of 1 m, and as 259 +/- 42.61 MgC ha(-1) for fringe soils up to 80 cm depth (maximum soil depth for fringe soils). Using analyses of mineralogy (Al- and Fe-oxides, clay minerals) as well as isotopic analyses of carbon (C-13), the origin of the sediments and their carbon was determined. We found that basin soils in Cispata bay show similar mineralogical composition than those of fluvial sediments, but the carbon concentration of river sediments was close to zero. Given the large capacity of the Fe and Al oxides in clay minerals to store dissolved carbon, and that the isotopic composition of the carbon is mostly of plant origin, we concluded contrary to our initial hypothesis that the carbon stored in basin mangrove soils are produced in situ. The deposited fluvial sediments do play an important role for carbon storage, but mostly in providing binding surfaces for the stabilization of organic carbon.

TI  - Guidelines on Composite Flexible Risers: Monitoring Techniques and Design Approaches
AB  - The increasing energy demand has led to more explorations in the oil and gas industry. To achieve this, marine risers and pipelines are used to convey fluid and other resources to meet the increasing demand. In recent years, hybrid flexible composite risers have become more adaptable. Flexible risers have already proven to be a popular riser solution for various floating production systems in shallow to deepwater in many parts of the world due to their good dynamic behaviour and dependability. The hybrid flexible composite riser is made up of numerous layers of plastics, flexible pipes, composites, and steel. Some innovative monitoring methods, such as Fiber Optics Bragg Gratings (FBG), are based on a clamped composite structure with embedded optical fibre. This study presents characteristics of the monitoring techniques of composite flexible riser technology. The advantages of the monitoring techniques include aiding composite riser measurements, recording data from riser deformation, improving integrity assurance, and dependability of design from stable readings. It also proposes some design approaches as guidelines that are advised, with some policy implications.

TI  - The role of root decomposition in global mangrove and saltmarsh carbon budgets
AB  - This study aims to determine the drivers of root decomposition and its role in carbon (C) budgets in mangroves and saltmarsh. We review the patterns of root decomposition, and its contribution to C budgets, in mangroves and saltmarsh: the impact of climatic (temperature and precipitation), geographic (latitude), temporal (decay period) and biotic (ecosystem type) drivers using multiple regression models. Best-fit models explain 50\% and 48\% of the variance in mangrove and saltmarsh root decay rates, respectively. A combination of biotic, climatic, geographic and temporal drivers influences root decay rates. Rainfall and latitude have the strongest influence on root decomposition rates in saltmarsh. For mangroves, forest type is the most important; decomposition is faster in riverine mangroves than other types. Mangrove species Avicennia marina and saltmarsh species Spartina maritima and Phragmites australis have the highest root decomposition rates. Root decomposition rates of mangroves were slightly higher in the Indo-west Pacific region (average 0.16\% day(-1)) than in the Atlantic-east Pacific region (0.13\% day(-1)). Mangrove root decomposition rates also show a negative exponential relationship with porewater salinity. In mangroves, global root decomposition rates are 0.15\% day(-1) based on the median value of rates in individual studies (and 0.14\% day(-1) after adjusting for area of mangroves at different latitudes). In saltmarsh, global root decomposition rates average 0.12\% day(-1) (no adjustment for area with latitude necessary). Our global estimate of the amount of root decomposing is 10 Tg C yr(-1) in mangroves (8 Tg C yr(-1) adjusted for area by latitude) and 31 Tg C yr(-1) in saltmarsh. Local root C burial rates reported herein are 51-54 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for mangroves (58-61 Tg C yr(-1) adjusted for area by latitude) and 191 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for saltmarsh. These values account for 24.1-29.1\% (mangroves) and 77.9\% (saltmarsh) of the reported sediment C accumulation rates in these habitats. Globally, dead root C production is the significant source of stored sediment C in mangroves and saltmarsh. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - An assessment of offshore wind energy potential using mesoscale model and geographic information system
AB  - Offshore wind climate along the coast of Kanto area was investigated by a mesoscale model and wind energy potential considering economical and social criteria was estimated by Geographical Information System (GIS). The prediction accuracy of the annual mean wind speed by the mesoscale model was 4.8%. The estimated wind climate shows that offshore Choshi, the annual mean wind speed is significantly higher than other area. Without considering any economical or social criteria, the total potential along the coast of Kanto area is 287TWh/year, which is almost equal to the annual supply of Tokyo Electric Power Company. If only the bottom mounted foundation is used, the potential varies from 0.21TWh/year to 7.98TWh/year depending on the scenario. On the other hand, when floating foundation is taken into consideration, the potential is 100.59TWh/year even for the most conservative scenario.

TI  - Centrifuge model study on vertical pullout behavior of square plate anchors in normally consolidated clay
AB  - Plate anchors are commonly employed as the foundation system for transmission towers, earth-retaining structures and offshore floating systems. A number of studies have been conducted in the past decades to examine the vertical uplift resistance of plate anchors, most of which were based on theoretical and numerical analysis or experiments under normal gravity level. In this study, centrifuge model tests incorporating half plate anchor models are performed to study the pull-out behavior of plate anchors in normally consolidated soft clay. The present study establishes that the pullout capacity factor of anchor reaches a limiting value of 12.54 when the anchor embedment ratio, denoting the anchor embedment depth over anchor width (H/B), exceeds 2. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) analyses were also conducted to investigate the soil flow mechanism during the uplift process. It is found that a general failure mechanism is operative when H/B is smaller than 2 and a localized failure mechanism with full soil back flow is observed for higher anchor embedment ratios.

AB  - Photothermal evaporation and desalination via renewable solar energy has promising potential to alleviate freshwater scarcity. However, recent reported systems usually lack sufficient environmental compatibility, ecological security, and energy-saving concern. Here, a novel and green photothermal evaporation system with ecological and economic advantages was designed. An evaporation performance of 1.18 kg.m(-2) (1.09 kg.m(-2).h(-1)) with up to 79.5\% efficiency at one sun illumination (1 kW.m(-2)) was achieved. More importantly, a series of simulation and numerical modelling was synchronously developed to analyze in-depth the main factors that affect water transportation and evaporation processes. The channel size, temperature distribution, and formed gradient were carefully investigated and discussed. Notably, this system exhibited satisfactory repeatability and stability. In addition, only a few photothermal components are required in this system, which will also bring a significant economic merit. Taken together, this work successfully provides new insights into developing a sustainable photothermal evaporation system with ecologically friendly property and satisfactory performance in practical application. Moreover, it also reveals the corresponding water transportation and photothermal evaporation mechanisms, and maximizes the evaporation efficiency.

TI  - Hybrid Control Strategy for AC Voltage Stabilization in Bipolar VSC-MTDC
AB  - Using VSC-MTDC for wind farm integration is considered to be a promising solution. In order to provide a stable ac voltage control and avoid active power control conflicts, the amplitude-phase control strategy, rather than the active/reactive power decoupled control strategy, is generally applied for the VSC connected to wind farms. However, using such a control strategy, the flexibility of power flow control will be partly lost. As the positive and negative pole dc networks in the bipolar VSC-MTDC can operate independently, a novel hybrid control strategy is proposed in this paper. In the proposed hybrid control strategy, the amplitude-phase control and active/reactive power decoupled control can be applied to the positive and negative poles, respectively. Hence, the hybrid strategy combines the advantages of the amplitude-phase control and active/reactive power decoupled control and can be adapted to bipolar VSC-MTDC for large-scale wind farm integration. Simulation results using PSCAD show that the hybrid control strategy can provide the stable ac voltage control and active/reactive power flow control for the integration of wind farms; moreover, such a hybrid control strategy is helpful to avoid the overload of dc lines, stabilize the dc voltage, and enhance the power transfer capability.

TI  - Managing constant bottom hole pressure with continuous flow systems
AB  - Managing downhole pressure and temperature is critical, particularly in deepwater, high-pressure, high-temperature (HP/HT), extended reach drilling (ERD), and other challenging operating conditions. A large percentage of all drilling hazards related to wellbore pressure occur when mud pumps are cycled off and on during connections, causing fluctuations in equivalent circulation densities (ECD) and downhole pressure and temperature spikes. These conditions can result in expensive downtime, safety issues, and the inability to drill a well within extreme scenarios. Continuous flow system (CFS) technology mitigates the hazards of wellbore pressure drilling even while mud pumps are cycled off and on during connections. Unregulated, these cycles can cause ECD fluctuations and downhole pressure spikes. The system ensures constant bottomhole pressure. This variant of Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) can reduce expensive downtime, minimize safety issues, and enable safe and efficient drilling in otherwise undrillable wells. This technology can enable the drilling team to decrease nonproductive time by providing continuous circulation, which improves hole cleaning and maintains ECD. Test results of the use of a continuous flow system under development reveal that the system can maintain bottomhole pressure constant consistently and continuously.

TI  - Greenhouse gas balances in coastal ecosystems: Current challenges in â€œblue carbonâ€ estimation and significance to national greenhouse gas inventories
AB  - Coastal wetlands are defined herein as inundated, vegetated ecosystems with hydrology, and biogeochemistry influenced by sea levels, at timescales of tides to millennia. Coastal wetlands are necessary components of global greenhouse gas estimation and scenario modeling, both for continental and oceanic mass balances. The carbon pools and fluxes on coastal lands, especially those influenced by tidal drivers and sea level rise, are distinct in their magnitude, rates, and uncertainties. We describe herein the pathways taken for a US scale estimation of blue carbon based on annual timesteps and bottom-up modeling, as appropriate for the first effort to include coastal wetlands in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines for a National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (NGGI). As such, we summarize multiple efforts to reconcile mapping, modeling, and measurement issues and we report the assumptions we made based on data availability. Provided as requested feedback to the IPCC.

TI  - Intuitionistic fuzzy multi-criteria decision making framework based on life cycle environmental, economic and social impacts: The case of U.S. wind energy
AB  - Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set theory can be used in conjunction with environmentally extended input-output based life cycle assessment (EE-IO-LCA) models to help decision makers to address the inherent vagueness and uncertainties in certain sustainable energy planning problems. In this regard, the EE-IO-LCA model can be combined with an intuitionistic fuzzy set theory for a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) application with a set of environmental and socio-economic indicators. To achieve this goal, this study proposes the use of the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution method to select the best wind energy alternative for a double layer MCDM problem, which requires expert judgments to simultaneously apply appropriate weighting to each life cycle phase and sustainability indicator to be considered. The novelty of this research is to propose a generic 9-step fuzzy MCDM method to solve sustainable energy decision-making problems using a combination of three different techniques: (1) an intuitionistic fuzzy entropy method to identify the individual importance of phases and criteria; (2) an IFWGA operator to establish a sub-decision matrix with the weights applied to all relevant attributes; and (3) an IFWAA operator to build a super-decision matrix with the weights applied to all of the life-cycle phases considered. This proposed method is then applied as a case study for sustainable energy planning, specifically for the selection of V80 and V90 onshore and offshore wind turbines to be installed in the United States. It is strongly believed that this methodology will provide a vital guidance for LCA practitioners in the future for selecting the best possible energy alternative under an uncertain decision-making scenario.

TI  - The impact of climate change on wind power production in Scotland
AB  - Climate-forced changes in atmospheric circulation patterns can pose challenges to the development of an efficient wind energy industry. The predicted shifts in circumpolar storm tracks and pressure gradients have a significant effect on local wind resource availability, and impact the wind energy industry in a time of crucial expansion. This study uses Scotland as a case study to model the impact of the SRES A1B climate change scenario on current wind resource availability and wind power potential at two wind farms: Gordonbush (NE Scotland) and Dun Law (SE Scotland). The results predicted an increase of wind resource availability at Gordonbush, and a decrease at Dun Law, leading to corresponding changes in net annual electricity production: a 31.7\% increase at Gordonbush and a 31.8\% decrease at Dun Law by the year 2040. The majority of observed changes can be attributed to climate-forced changes in atmospheric circulation patterns; however, this research also shows the impact of turbine specifications and site characteristics on the vulnerability of wind power production to climate change. Further work is needed to establish a robust relationship between large-scale climate forcing and local wind resource availability, and to integrate this relationship into the assessment framework of on-shore wind farms around the world.

TI  - Downhole real time wireless telemetry system applications in deepwater completions in the Gulf of Mexico
AB  - The scope of the paper is to introduce the application of a new wireless downhole real time telemetry tool and its applications in three different deepwater completions operations. The main method to explain the technology application is through three case histories. In two of these case histories, the availability of downhole real time data led to actions on the surface that ensure the positive outcome of the operation. In the third one, the continuous monitoring of well conditions increase the safety and efficiency aspect of the operation. Another approach used in the paper to validate the technology is the comparison of the field real time data with the expected behavior predicted by the modeling done before the operation. In the fracpack case, pipe contraction due to cooling led to the application of unexpected additional weight on surface. The quantification of different contraction ratios versus temperature drop can help understand the relative movement during operations of downhole tools. In the second case, in the multi-zone single trip system (MZST), the downhole weight transmission monitoring was able to quantify weight transmission at different times of the operation, as expected when the inner string of the tool was inside the outer and permanent string of the system, according to the tubing movement analysis buckling was minimum. In the fluid loss control case, fluid level drop in real time, allowed the determination of fluid loss rate in-situ and secure the well control aspect of the operation immediately after perforating gun (TCP) firing and after an acid frac job. The control of the losses by an optimum overbalance, minimize fluid control losses and reservoir damage. The case histories will show the direct benefits of the technology in well control and productivity, in the completions operations like TCP, fracpack and MZST.

TI  - Probabilistic Forecasts of Wind Power Generation Accounting for Geographically Dispersed Information
AB  - Forecasts of wind power generation in their probabilistic form are a necessary input to decision-making problems for reliable and economic power systems operations in a smart grid context. Thanks to the wealth of spatially distributed data, also of high temporal resolution, such forecasts may be optimized by accounting for spatio-temporal effects that are so far merely considered. The way these effects may be included in relevant models is described for the case of both parametric and non-parametric approaches to generating probabilistic forecasts. The resulting predictions are evaluated on the real-world test case of a large offshore wind farm in Denmark (Nysted, 165 MW), where a portfolio of 19 other wind farms is seen as a set of geographically distributed sensors, for lead times between 15 minutes and 8 hours. Forecast improvements are shown to mainly come from the spatio-temporal correction of the first order moments of predictive densities. The best performing approach, based on adaptive quantile regression, using spatially corrected point forecasts as input, consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark based on local information only, by 1.5\%-4.6\%, depending upon the lead time.

TI  - Development of a 300 kW horizontal-axis tidal stream energy conversion system with adaptive variable-pitch turbine and direct-drive PMSG
AB  - The adaptation to changes in flow direction is the premise to harness the bidirectional flow energy for a tidal stream turbine. Present studies usually aim at active variable-pitch or steering with dynamic sealing to carry out this task. In this paper, a 300 kW horizontal-axis tidal stream energy conversion system with an adaptive variable-pitch turbine and an outer-rotor type PMSG is developed. Based on the BEMT, the principle of the turbine with symmetrical airfoils and backward swept blades to follow the bidirectional flow is presented, and the hydrodynamic performances, such as pitching, starting, power and thrust, are discussed. The encapsulated windings and magnets of the PMSG can expose to the seawater, and the output characteristics are analyzed at different conditions in the factory. Both the turbine and generator are characterized by no dynamic sealing. The experiment results in the field show that the bidirectional flow energy can be extracted effectively, and the generator can work well to output electric power steadily. The hydrodynamic performances predicted by the modified BEMT meet the design re-quirements of the 300 kW prototype. The successful field trial of this novel device lays solid support for the utilization of the bidirectional tidal stream energy. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - An investigation into making ships cleaner and more energy efficient
AB  - "Naval-fx" consists of the development of a novel device (diffuser-receiver) with memory effect connected to the Internet and ready on board the ship which allows through the use of the already know quantum theory the molecular reorganization of the matter applied to marine fuels. The principles of quantum physics studied and interpreted and applied in the right way allow the establishment of an algorithmic relationship between the magnetic field information of the material (in this case the fuel) to be treated and a series of sound frequencies that are emitted from a server. It allows the aforementioned molecular reorganization of the treated matter and thereby a reduction in the emissions on board CO, CO2, NOx and SOx among other advantages such as noise and vibrations reduction or longer engine life. This process has been called "Dynamization". The main effect (based on molecular reorganization) is based on returning to atoms and molecules their original properties (before extraction, transport, refinement, etc.) through activation as explained above of their Magnetic field information. The phenomenon of activation of the system realized through computer algorithms will allow to instantly alter the magnetic information field of an atom and molecule or particle set at any distance without any loss of power made which surpasses all the electromagnetic and chemical systems employed today.

TI  - Performance investigation of an innovative vertical axis turbine consisting of deflectable blades
AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the performance of an innovative vertical axis turbine which possesses the blade-self-deflection function for ocean current and tidal energy application. The blade deflection is accomplished by interaction of blades and related mechanisms as the turbine rotates. To enhance the turbine performance, it is designed that the blade deflection not only increases the power output for a downstream blade, but also decreases the resistance for an upstream blade. The observation of the prototype in laboratory flume is displayed to validate the feasibility. Furthermore, a commercial code is employed to analyze the turbine performance. The velocity and pressure contours of the calculation domain are simulated to obtain the torque and power output of deflectable-blade turbine. Moreover, the results of performance analysis are validated by the experimental data. The detailed flow field analysis and hydrodynamic characteristic are reported as deflectable-blade turbine is driven by the water stream. The results show that the maximum and minimum total torque for this turbine occur at Î¸Â =Â 45Â° and Î¸Â =Â 75Â°, respectively as it rotates one-quarter turn. In performance comparison, the maximal power coefficient of the deflectable-blade turbine is 41.1% higher than that of traditional vertical axis turbine with fixed blades for stream velocity of 1Â m/s. Furthermore, the correlations of optimal angular velocity and maximal power output for the deflectable-blade turbine are obtained for current velocity from 0.6Â m/s to 2.2Â m/s for hydropower applications.

TI  - Simulation of Wind Power Integration with Modular Multilevel Converter-Based High Voltage Direct Current
AB  - The growing demand for large-capacity long distance transmission of wind power has boosted the development of flexible direct current (DC) transmission technology. To facilitate wind power integration, this paper designs a modular multilevel converter (MMC) for steady-state operation, using the parameters of the demonstration DC transmission project of offshore wind power in Sheyang County, eastern China's Jiangsu Province. Relying on the simulation platform of PSCAD/EMTDC, the authors analyzed the proposed control theory, and verified that, under different working conditions (e.g., changing wind speed), the MMC-based high voltage direct current (MMC-HVDC) transmission system can integrate the wind power safely and efficiently. In addition, the authors discussed how to enhance the fault ride-through (FRT), a prominent problem in wind power operation, of the flexible DC system containing wind power, from the perspective of alternating current (AC) fault and DC fault.

TI  - Sensitivity analysis of the wave energy converters operating in the french coastal waters
AB  - The aim of the present work is to assess the performances reported by some state-of-the-art wave energy converters which may operate in the vicinity of the French coastal waters. 10 years of wave data (2008-2017) coming from the ERA â€“ Interim project, have been considered and several reference sites have been defined along the French coastlines of the North Atlantic Ocean and of the Mediterranean Sea, respectively. From the assessment of the wave conditions, it was noticed that more important resources are encountered on the north-western parts of the western coasts, while from the eastern coasts the region located between Toulon and Sardinia seems to present interest. As expected, the performances of the wave generators are directly related to the wave energy, although the sites from the eastern coasts are defined by deeper water areas.

TI  - Planning for a 100% renewable energy system for the Santiago Island, Cape Verde
AB  - Ensuring the supply of affordable energy, improving energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions are some of the priorities of the governments of several countries. The pursuit of these energy goals has triggered interest in the exploration and usage of Renewable Energy Sources (RES), which can be particularly appropriate for island systems as is the case of Cape Verde. This work proposes a generation expansion planning model for Cape Verde considering a 20 yearsâ€™ period. Different scenarios were analysed, each one representing a possible RES contribution for electricity production, reaching a 100% RES share. The results demonstrate that the increase of the RES in the system will lead to an increase in the total system cost. However, a significant decrease in both CO2 emissions and external energy dependency of the country is projected. The seasonality of the RES resources, and in particular of wind power is shown to be one of the most important challenges for the effective uptake of such a renewable power system. A least-cost solution might be possibly achieved if storage technologies would be considered within the modelling approach (e.g. battery and Power-to-Gas technologies) which would also contribute to accommodate the Critical Excess of Electricity Production (CEEP). While the proposed model allowed already to present some useful scenarios, it becomes also evident the need to expand the analysis by using hourly data and taking into account the sectorâ€™s integration (e.g. power, heat and transport).

TI  - Energetic Sustainability Using Renewable Energies in the Mediterranean Sea
AB  - The paper is focused on the analysis of the electrical energy sector in the Maltese islands, focusing on the employment of Renewable Energies in order to increase its energy independence. The main renewable source here proposed is wave energy: thanks to its strategic position, Malta will be able to generate electrical energy through the use of an innovative type of Wave Energy Converter (WEC) based on the prototype of linear generator designed and developed by the University of Palermo. This new technology will be able to cut down the electrical energy production from traditional power plants and, consequently, the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Wave energy source and off-shore photovoltaic (PV) technology are proposed here. Particularly, the installation of 18 wave farms, for a total installed capacity of 130 MW, will generate about 5.7\% of Malta's energy requests in 2025, while the installation of 60 MW of off-shore PV will generate about 4.4\%.

TI  - Modified Newton-Raphson load flow analysis for integrated AC/DC power systems
AB  - The significant increase in planned offshore wind parks and the tendency towards large parks in considerable distances offshore, make the well established HVDC technology a favorable solution for the connection of these large \& distant offshore wind parks to the main power grid onshore. It is therefore necessary to adequately model the HVDC transmission links and integrate them in the load flow analysis of the complete a.c.-d.c. system. In this paper, the well known Newton-Raphson method for the load flow analysis is modified to achieve compatibility for a.c.-d.c. systems with integrated d.c. links in the a.c. network. The elements of the residual vector and the Jacobian matrix for the a.c. network are kept unchanged and are merely complemented by a new vector and a new matrix, which represent the modifications due to the d.c. link . The modified Jacobian equation includes the d.c. real and reactive power at the a.c.-d.c. buses, and their dependency on the a.c. system variables. The modified Newton-Raphson method is evaluated on an a.c.-d.c. test system with a load flow computation in MATLAB and the results are presented.

TI  - Obama address touches on research, energy, and environmental issues
AB  - President Barack Obama's State of the Union message, delivered on 24 January, touched on the need for basic research, energy production, support for clean energy, and environmental protection, but it included just one passing reference to climate change. In addition, the speech made no note of the Administration's recent denial of a controversial application for the Keystone XL pipeline to transport crude oil from Canada to the United States and made just an elliptical reference regarding the bankrupt Solyndra Corporation, which the administration had touted as a clean energy company. Innovation "demands basic research," Obama said, adding that Congress should not "gut these investments in our budget." Noting that one promise for innovation is American-made energy, Obama said he is directing the administration to "open more than 75% of our potential offshore oil and gas resources.".

TI  - Feasibility study of the marine electromagnetic remote sensing (MEMRS) method for near-shore exploration
AB  - Marine controlled source electromagnetic (MCSEM) surveys have become an important part of offshore petroleum exploration. However, there exist very near-shore areas, with the depth varying from tens of meters to a few hundred meters, where it is technically difficult to use a towed electrical bipole transmitter. In some cases, the operating of the controlled electric sources in the near-shore zones is prohibited by the environmental concerns of the impact of the powerful electric current on the marine fauna. To address the needs of EM exploration in the near-shore zones, a new marine EM method has been recently developed, which is called marine electromagnetic remote sensing (MEMRS). This method consists of a very high moment onshore electric bipole transmitter and a large array of offshore receivers. In this paper we present a feasibility study of the MEMRS method. Â© 2013 SEG.

TI  - Evaluation on the energy efficiency and emissions reduction of a short-route hybrid sightseeing ship
AB  - This paper is to develop a coordinated control strategy of a ship with hybrid power and evaluate on the energy efficiency and emissions reduction of the case ship. The hybrid power system consists of 4-stoke diesel generator, solar panels and battery packs. A micro-grid power system was structured to offer an optimal combination of the three power sources in terms high efficiency and low emissions of the overall system. The control requirements for the developed micro-grid power system were analysed according to the principles of priority to use renewable energy. A power distribution control strategy was designed by applying the logic threshold method. A system simulation model was established and the simulation was carried out with MATLAB. An experimental test rig was built to evaluate the simulation results and develop the control system. The developed marine micro-grids power system has been applied on a case ship and run stably. Compared with the conventional power system, the performance of emission and economic of the hybrid system is studied with the case ships. The results of case ship and experimental have shown that the developed hybrid micro grid system can be managed effectively by the proposed control strategy. The emission of CO2 is dramatically decreased in any cases and the energy cost is reduced considering for the ship life-cycle. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Composite tidal turbine to harness ocean energy
AB  - The Aircraft Design and Aeroflight Dynamics Group (ADAG), part of the Department of Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Naples, Italy, is working on a second-generation turbine prototype, the MYTHOS, featuring carbon composite blades and glass-reinforced support arms, turning on a vertically oriented axis. It is expected to improve an ENERMAR's performance, a pilot tidal turbine plant, which produces 25 kW of electrical energy from a marine current of only 2 m/s. Composite blades' high rigidity will keep them from bending, which will minimize hydrodynamic losses. On Mythos, ADAG is likely to replace the steel arms and fairings used in ENERMAR with hydrodynamically contoured composite arms, probably fiberglass with polyester resin. The arm's reduced thickness and resulting smaller chord will reduce its wetted area, inturn minimizing drag. The MYTHOS system will yield a predicted energy cost of about $0.10/kWh even as a prototype, which translates to a promising commercial rate.

TI  - News review: IHC Merwede to develop W3GM's OWTIS
AB  - W3G Marine (W3GM) based in Aberdeen, Scotland, and the Dutch shipbuilder IHC Merwede collaborated on the development of W3GM's patented design for an offshore wind turbine installation ship (OWTIS). The OWTIS concept has major advantages over existing assets, not least in its ability to improve offshore safety by necessitating fewer tasks to be performed offshore. It is environmentally friendly and able to operate in harsh weather and deploy large loads. The OWTIS concept is not limited by water depth and is readily transferable to the oil and gas heavy-lift market. The purpose-designed OWTIS will be equipped with a unique 1500-ton crane which, when used in conjunction with the patented lift system, will enable fully assembled wind turbines to be installed in one lift onto pre-installed foundations. This new industry-changing vessel will reduce the cost of installing offshore wind turbines by at least one third compared to current methods. IHC Merwede and W3GM expect that OWTIS will be the first of a series of vessels to enable the burgeoning offshore wind industry to meet the economic targets for round three of offshore wind farm development in the UK and other similar projects in Europe.

TI  - Powering an island energy system by offshore floating technologies towards 100% renewables: A case for the Maldives
AB  - Low-lying coastal areas and archipelago countries are particularly threatened by the impacts of climate change. Concurrently, many island states still rely on extensive use of imported fossil fuels, above all diesel for electricity generation, in addition to hydrocarbon-based fuels to supply aviation and marine transportation. Land area is usually scarce and conventional renewable energy solutions cannot be deployed in a sufficient way. This research highlights the possibility of floating offshore technologies being able to fulfil the task of replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy solutions in challenging topographical areas. On the case of the Maldives, floating offshore solar photovoltaics, wave power and offshore wind are modelled on a full hourly resolution in two different scenarios to deal with the need of transportation fuels: By importing the necessary, carbon neutral synthetic e-fuels from the world market, or by setting up local production capacities for e-fuels. Presented results show that a fully renewable energy system is technically feasible in 2030 with a relative cost per final energy of 120.3 â‚¬/MWh and 132.1 â‚¬/MWh, respectively, for the two scenarios in comparison to 105.7 â‚¬/MWh of the reference scenario in 2017. By 2050, cost per final energy can be reduced to 77.6 â‚¬/MWh and 92.6 â‚¬/MWh, respectively. It is concluded that floating solar photovoltaics and wave energy converters will play an important role in defossilisation of islands and countries with restricted land area. Â© 2021 The Author(s)

TI  - Climate change effects on the ecophysiology and ecological functioning of an offshore wind farm artificial hard substrate community
AB  - In the effort towards a decarbonised future, the local effects of a proliferating offshore wind farm (OWF) industry add to and interact with the global effects of marine climate change. This study aimed to quantify potential ecophysiological effects of ocean warming and acidification and to estimate and compare the cumulative clearance potential of suspended food items by OWF epifauna under current and future climate conditions. To this end, this study combined ecophysiological responses to ocean warming and acidification of three dominant colonising species on OWF artificial hard substrates (the blue mussel Mytilus edulis, the tube-building amphipod Jassa herdmani and the plumose anemone Metridium senile). In general, mortality, respiration rate and clearance rate increased during 3- to 6-week experimental exposures across all three species, except for M. senile, who exhibited a lower clearance rate in the warmed treatments (+3 Â°C) and an insensitivity to lowered pH (âˆ’0.3 pH units) in terms of survival and respiration rate. Ocean warming and acidification affected growth antagonistically, with elevated temperature being beneficial for M. edulis and lowered pH being beneficial for M. senile. The seawater volume potentially cleared from suspended food particles by this AHS colonising community increased significantly, extending the affected distance around an OWF foundation by 9.2% in a future climate scenario. By using an experimental multi-stressor approach, this study thus demonstrates how ecophysiology underpins functional responses to climate change in these environments, highlighting for the first time the integrated, cascading potential effects of OWFs and climate change on the marine ecosystem.

TI  - Marine floating solar plants: An overview of potential, challenges and feasibility
AB  - The offshore environment represents a vast source of renewable energy, and marine renewable energy plants have the potential to contribute to the future energy mix significantly. Floating solar technology emerged nearly a decade ago, driven mainly by the lack of available land, loss of efficiency at high operating cell temperature, energy security and decarbonisation targets. The vast majority of the available technology and projects in operation are located in inland freshwater bodies. Currently there is momentum in the sector to develop floating solar systems to be deployed in marine environments. Experience from inland floating solar projects could open up possibilities to scale up and move to nearshore or even offshore conditions. Hence, it is relevant to explore the technical feasibility and challenges of designing floating photovoltaics (FPV) in marine environments, with a natural transition of FPV applications first to nearshore locations and then further exposed offshore environments. This research study provides a literature review of the potential of marine applications of floating solar plants, exploring the current available technologies, the technical challenges and the risks in designing and building these projects in the marine environment.

TI  - Solar radiation and water for emission-free marine mobility
AB  - Solar powered boats can provide emission-free water transportation. However, due to uncontrollable radiation of the sun, they cannot reliably be applied to commercial transportation. This paper describes a research hybrid boat which is powered by photovoltaic cells and uses fuel cells as a back-up system. The hydrogen required to operate the fuel cells is produced by stationary photovoltaic cells and stored in a tank. An energy management system provides for optimum use of the hydrogen. Energy production and energy usage is emission free. Â© 2014 IEEE.

TI  - Future biological and ecosystem impacts of ocean acidification and their socioeconomic-policy implications
AB  - Anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to the atmosphere and subsequent uptake by the ocean are changing seawater chemistry, a process known as ocean acidification. Research indicates that as ocean acidification continues, reflecting increasing CO2 emissions, it is likely that although some species will be tolerant it will impact many marine organisms and processes, including composition of communities and food webs. Whilst there may be local actions to limit acidification from local sources the root cause of ocean acidification, CO2 emissions, is a global issue requiring global action through United Nations bodies.

TI  - Lateral behaviour of large diameter monopiles at Sheringham Shoal Wind Farm
AB  - There are very sound reasons for the growth of the offshore wind industry. Both the UK and Europe as a whole possess considerable wind resources as measured in mean wind speed and consistency. Most of the existing wind energy turbines in the North Sea are founded on monopiles, and the most common geotechnical design method for these piles is the p-y concept according to the API regulations. However, the validity of this method is not proved for large diameter piles with predominantly lateral loading. In this paper the relation between the API model and a more advanced Finite Difference method is investigated for one location at the Sheringham Shoal Offshore Wind Farm site. The analyses were carried out using the computer programs SPLICE and FLAC 3D. The analyses show that based on the same geotechnical properties, the traditional API method gives larger deformation than the Finite Difference code using the softening-hardening soil model.

TI  - Carbon emission and economic output of China's marine fishery â€“ A decoupling efforts analysis
AB  - While marine capture fishery contributes to ever-increasing economic output, it also produces ever-increasing carbon emissions. Increasing the economic output of marine capture fishery while controlling its carbon emissions requires a better understanding of the relationship between the economic output of marine capture fishery and its carbon emissions. To this end, this work investigated the relationship between carbon emission and economic output, the key influencing factors of carbon emission, and the decoupling efforts in China's marine capture fishery using decoupling index, decomposition technique, and decoupling efforts model. The results indicate: (i) Decoupling state of all coastal regions got improved, especially Guangdong province which presented the best decoupling state, the stably strong decoupling. (ii) Carbon intensity is not only major contributor to carbon reduction, but also major effort maker to decoupling progress. On the contrary, industry structure was the primary inhibitor in almost coastal regions. (iii) All coastal regions made decoupling efforts in studying period, and over half of them made strong decoupling efforts. Last but not least, some policy implications are proposed.

TI  - Oceans Measurements for Engineering Design
AB  - Oceans Ltd. will present the technology being used to collect current and wave data offshore Newfoundland. The company has designed a data transmission system where current data collected by ADCP's are transmitted acoustically to the surface by acoustic modems to a telemetry buoy which re-transmits the data via RF communication link to the oil drilling platforms. The advantage and challenges of this system will be presented. The quality of the current data stored in the ADCP's will be discussed with respect to the data gaps and the ocean environment, and the challenges it presents with respect to engineering design. Engineering design criteria also requires good measurements of the wave climate and utilized methodologies such as extremal analysis and peak enhancement factors. These parameters are being modified as more information becomes available.

TI  - Sedimentary carbon on the continental shelf: Emerging capabilities and research priorities for Blue Carbon
AB  - Continental shelf sediments store large amounts of organic carbon. Protecting this carbon from release back into the marine system and managing the marine environment to maximize its rate of accumulation could both play a role in mitigating climate change. For these reasons, in the context of an expanding ``Blue Carbon{''} concept, research interest in the quantity and vulnerability of carbon stored in continental shelf, slope, and deep ocean sediments is increasing. In these systems, carbon storage is physically distant from carbon sources, altered between source and sink, and disturbed by anthropogenic activities. The methodological approaches needed to obtain the evidence to assess shelf sea sediment carbon manageability and vulnerability within an evolving blue carbon framework cannot be transferred directly from those applied in coastal vegetated ``traditional{''} blue carbon habitats. We present a toolbox of methods which can be applied in marine sediments to provide the evidence needed to establish where and when marine carbon in offshore sediments can contribute to climate mitigation, focusing on continental shelf sediments. These methods are discussed in the context of the marine carbon cycle and how they provide evidence on: (i) stock: how much carbon is there and how is it distributed? (ii) accumulation: how rapidly is carbon being added or removed? and (iii) anthropogenic pressures: is carbon stock and/or accumulation vulnerable to manageable human activities? Our toolbox provides a starting point to inform choice of techniques for future studies alongside consideration of their specific research questions and available resources. Where possible, a stepwise approach to analyses should be applied in which initial parameters are analysed to inform which samples, if any, will provide information of interest from more resource-intensive analyses. As studies increasingly address the knowledge gaps around continental shelf carbon stocks and accumulation - through both sampling and modelling - the management of this carbon with respect to human pressures will become the key question for understanding where it fits within the blue carbon framework and within the climate mitigation discourse.

TI  - Impact of micro-droplets on superhydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces
AB  - Ice accretion is a major threat to all exposed structures such as wind turbines, overhead power cables, offshore structures and aircrafts. Such deposition starts by an impact of water droplets of different sizes on the surface of the exposed structure. This work aims to shed more light on the difference in the dynamics occurring upon the impact of microdroplets on substrates with various wettabilities, hydrophilic (aluminum) and Superhydrophobic (Aluminum + WX2100) surfaces. Experiments are conducted on a wide range of diameters, between cloud sized droplets with diameters ranging down to 20Î¼m, and 10 times larger droplets with a diameter of 250 Î¼m. A comparison in the impact (through deformation) results is made all through the wide range and explained using the two extremes. This is done experimentally by analyzing the maximum spread diameter on the hydrophillic surface and superhydrophobic surface and maximum height as a function of time on the hydrophillic surface. Both parameters are visualized experimentally, simulated numerically for the same impact velocities and then results are compared for verification. Copyright Â© 2014 by ASME.

The hammer can work in depths of up to 300 m, can be fixed to the top of the pile and needs to be only roughly half the size of surface piling hammers when offshore. The design is centred around a hydraulic actuator with the rest of the pile hammer's components comprising a hammer, a hammer cage, power pack and control. (from paper)

TI  - Effect of hold up on the hydrate stability zone
AB  - Currently, reservoir fluid compositions (based on PVT reports) are used in predicting the hydrate stability zone. However, in multiphase flow there are variations in the local composition that may affect the hydrate stability zone. The main objective of this work was to investigate the effect of hold-up and the resulting variation in the local composition on the hydrate stability zone of various hydrocarbon systems. A thermodynamic software was used to predict the composition of various phases at different locations along a pipeline. A range of liquid hold-ups were assumed and the local composition was recalculated. The hydrate option of the software was used to predict the hydrate stability zone of the resulting local fluid composition. The calculations were repeated for a number of fluid systems and the results are presented in this work. The calculated hydrate stability zones for various hold-ups were compared with that of original reservoir fluid. The results show that hold-up plays an important role on the hydrate stability zone. High gas hold-up shifts the hydrate stability zone to the right. However, as high gas hold-ups occurs at high point and away from aqueous phase, in case of changes in the system conditions the amount of hydrates are limited to the amount of water available. This paper demonstrates that the hydrate stability zone of a multiphase fluid in a pipeline is a function of hold-up and the resulting changes in the local composition. This could have important consequences on the hydrate prevention strategies. Copyright Â© (2015) by the Offshore Technology Conference All rights reserved.

TI  - Dynamic response mitigation of floating wind turbine platforms using tuned liquid column dampers
AB  - In this paper, we experimentally study and compare the effects of three combinations of multiple tuned liquid column dampers (MTLCDs) on the dynamic performance of a model floating tension-leg platform (TLP) structure in a wave basin. The structural stability and safety of the floating structure during operation and maintenance is of concern for the performance of a renewable energy device that it might be supporting. The dynamic responses of the structure should thus be limited for these renewable energy devices to perform as intended. This issue is particularly important during the operation of a TLP in extreme weather conditions. Tuned liquid column dampers (TLCDs) can use the power of sloshing water to reduce surge motions of a floating TLP exposed to wind and waves. This paper demonstrates the potential of MTLCDs in reducing dynamic responses of a scaled TLP model through an experimental study. The potential of using output-only statistical markers for monitoring changes in structural conditions is also investigated through the application of a delay vector variance (DVV) marker for different conditions of control for the experiments.

TI  - On the trade-off between aviation NOx and energy efficiency
AB  - This study aims to assess the trade-off between the ever-increasing energy efficiency of modern aero-engines and their NOx performance. The work builds on performance models previously developed to optimise the specific fuel consumption of future aero-engine designs. As part of the present work a simple and adaptable NOx emissions correlation for Rich-burn Quick-quench Lean-burn combustor designs is derived. The proposed model is computationally inexpensive and sufficiently accurate for use in aero-engine multi-disciplinary conceptual design tools. Furthermore, it is possible to adapt the correlation to model the NOx emissions of combustors designed for very aggressive future cycles. An approach to lean-burn combustor NOx emissions modelling is also presented. The simulation results show that improving engine propulsive efficiency is likely to have a benign effect on NOx emissions at high altitude; at sea-level conditions NOx emissions are particularly likely to reduce. Improving engine thermal efficiency however has a detrimental effect on NOx emissions from RQL combustors, both at high altitude and particularly at sea-level conditions. LDI combustor technology does not demonstrate such behaviour. Current legislation permits trading NOx emissions engine efficiency and hence reduce CO2 emissions. If we are to reduce the contribution of aviation to global warming, however, future certification legislation may need to become more stringent and comprehensive. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The designing and developing of a programme with the specific objective to commission a new Multifunctional Underwater Support Vessel comes from the necessity of the IT Navy to replace IT Navy Ship ANTEO (ARS) that has reached it's operational life limit. The design criteria are driven by a combination of state-of-the-art commercial Offshore Support Vessel technology, with tight criteria in terms of functionality, ergonomics, safety and living comfort, and with Naval Standards required for naval operations such as helicopter (Helo) operations and military communications, all complying with international regulations that will come into force by 2014. The concept is to enable the It Navy to operate with a modern multirole, flexible, deployable unit, in order to support the Navy in it's Underwater Operations mainly for Search and Rescue of Distressed Submarines (Salvage Ship), Supporting the Italian Navy Diving Group (Supply Diving Vessel) and Supporting the Italian Special Forces for training and operational purpose.

TI  - Experience With Moored Observations in the Western Gulf of Maine From 2006 to 2012
AB  - The University of New Hampshire is studying CO2 gas exchange, ocean acidification, air-sea dynamics, and associated biological processes in the western Gulf of Maine. Two buoys provide data supporting these studies. The UNH CO2 buoy has been deployed jointly with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory northeast of the Isles of Shoals since 2006. The Jeffreys Ledge Moored Observatory is a development mooring testing new techniques and is deployed east of Gloucester, MA. This mooring is testing the direct covariance measurement of wind stress using a 3-D sonic anemometer with a motion package to remove buoy motion effects. A fast-rate atmospheric CO2 sensor is mounted by the anemometer to evaluate its potential for direct covariance gas flux measurements. Both buoys have additional meteorological and oceanographic sensors to provide supporting measurements. Six years of CO2 buoy data have helped quantify the seasonal air-sea flux cycle of CO2 in the Western Gulf of Maine. The buoy is now a node in near-term ocean carbon cycle process control experiments and longer-term ocean acidification monitoring. The Jeffreys Ledge buoy momentum flux measurements using wind and motion measurements indicate reasonable first-order buoy motion corrections can be made. Also, buoy-induced flow disturbance requires postmeasurement corrections. Rapid buoy azimuthal rotations were corrected with the addition of a steering vane. A vertical array of oxygen sensors captures phytoplankton bloom signatures and provides net community production estimates that augment in-water SAMI-CO2 measurements and add to a robust system to support process studies and improved biophysical modeling within this region.

TI  - Thermal Analysis of Brushless Doubly Fed Induction Machine
AB  - Brushless Doubly Fed Induction Machine (BDFIM) is a different type generator designed for energy production especially in offshore. A number of features of BDFIM which are frequency control and lack of brush make this generator advantageous energy generation from wind power. Although BDFIM owns some advantages, this machine is not commercially produced and it must be developed because of low efficiency and complex structure. Its design and analysis have been carried out to fix these disadvantages. Design of electrical machine is relevant to electromagnetic and thermal analysis. In this paper, thermal analysis of 3.2 MW BDFIM which is one of the most serious matter influencing the outputs is examined. Stator of BDFIM consists of two windings and they have different pole numbers and BDFIM owns nested loop squirrel cage rotor, consequently thermal analysis of BDFIM is more complex than other machines. In this paper, thermal resistances, capacitances and losses of BDFIM are calculated and transient and steady state thermal simulation is carried out with MATLAB/Simulink. In addition, flux density and flux lines of BDFIM are examined in Ansoft/MAXWELL to better evaluate thermal behavior. Â© 2018 IEEE.

TI  - Multiple earthing systems for offshore production platforms
AB  - Fixed offshore integrated oil and gas facilities will generally comprise accommodation, utilities, production and drilling facilities supplied from on-board centralised power generation via a fully integrated electrical distribution system. In such applications the selection of appropriate methods of system earthing is a key factor in achieving safe and reliable operations whilst meeting the sometimes differing requirements of the topsides and drilling operations. This paper considers the types of electrical power system configurations encountered on major offshore platforms and in particular considers the earth fault tolerance requirements of drilling operations to ensure supplies are maintained whilst moving towards make-well-secure conditions. The benefits and limitations of various options are discussed in relation to operation under both normal and emergency conditions and particular account is taken of achieving safe operations under life support and drilling make-well-secure conditions. The paper also discusses the differing practices worldwide and provides recommendations for achieving a comprehensive and effective integrated power system configuration.

TI  - Evaluation of rock mass stability and rock fall hazard for pipelines in submarine environments
AB  - Although relatively uncommon, rocky submarine outcrops with high to nearly vertical gradients do occur in various offshore settings, including high latitude fiords and tectonic margins with narrow or absent shelves, or high-gradient aprons constituted by ancient lithified carbonate reefs. Here pipelines and flowlines are subject to the hazard of landslides developed in the instable rock-mass and consequent impact of individual boulders. This paper proposes a methodology for the evaluation of landslide and rock fall hazard for pipelines in submarine rocky slopes. The analysis includes results from several common marine site investigations such as high resolution geophysical surveys, Side Scan Sonar imaging, ROV video transects and conventional geotechnical boreholes, and specific datasets including in-hole structural drilling and data from analogue outcrops into a probabilistic framework, aimed at establishing the risk of pipeline structural damage. The assessment of rock fall hazard for onshore infrastructures such as railways and roads is routinely evaluated based on well-established methodologies. Such analyses, however, either requires a full geomechanical understanding of the rock mass, hardly achievable offshore due to data limitations or a probabilistic evaluation of historical events, not applicable offshore. The methodology we propose overcomes these limitations and allows, after defining the maximum allowable impact energy for the design pipeline, obtaining the overall frequency of offshore pipeline damage and thus quantifying the risk associated to rock fall based on relevant standards and guidelines. The rock slope stability is evaluated using a limit equilibrium approach which includes pseudo-static accelerations. Given the uncertainties associated to key input parameters such as the mechanical properties of the rock mass, as well as to the size and trajectories of the failed rock wedges, a Monte Carlo probabilistic approach is preferred. The main outcome of the proposed methodology is the probability of pipeline failure in environments where rock mass instability and consequent rockfall phenomena represent a potential hazard.

The conductance of the VSC admittance can be shaped selecting appropriate VSC parameter values to increase VSC damping at poorly damped harmonic resonances and ensure system stability. This study extends existing findings and makes contributions in this direction. Analytical expressions of the positive- and negative-sequence VSC conductances are presented to study exhaustively the impact of VSC parameters on harmonic oscillatory instabilities. Two applications, i.e. a traction system and an offshore wind power plant, are used to show the contribution of this study. The analytical study is validated from PSCAD/EMTDC time-domain simulations.

TI  - Axial fatigue of spiral strands in offshore platform applications
AB  - Steel cables are used for mooring certain types of offshore platforms such as semi-submersibles, guyed towers, etc, and are proposed as elements of the mooring systems for wave energy devices, Their various characteristics (especially under cyclic Loading) are, therefore, of prime importance as regards a safe, economical, and functional performance of such structures, In a series of previous publications, a theoretical model capable of predicting axial fatigue life of multi-layered spiral strands from first principles, is reported. The analytical model is an extended version of a previously reported orthotropic sheet model, The theoretical predictions for some substantial spiral strands were backed by large scale experimental data, Recently, some very carefully documented axial fatigue test data on 25 and 45mm,O,D, spiral strands were reported by the team in University of Alberta. The important point about this data is the extensive reporting of the number and position of individual wire fractures along the test specimens, and (unlike the vast majority of other published data in the Literature) the full reporting of changes in a number of other properties of the cables (such as their axial stiffness) during the axial cyclic tests, with a careful description of the model(s) of failure, In the present paper, the encouraging support for the theoretical predictions by this recently reported set of axial fatigue test data is presented, The effect of mean axial load on the axial fatigue Life is subsequently examined, using an extensive series of theoretical parametric studies. The parametric studies were carried out using 3 types of realistic 127mm,O,D, spiral strand constructions with lay angles of 12, 18.01 and 24 degrees (which cover the current manufacturing limits), Using the results based on the parametric studies, the plausibility of using a simple Goodman (or Gerber) transformation for steel cables, as originally advocated by others, is critically examined, It is demonstrated that contrary to previous claims, presenting the axial fatigue test data in terms of an equivalent load range (with a minimum load of zero), rather than the traditional use of stress range, does not lead to any improvements in the fit of the data to a straight line. Indeed, it is theoretically shown that for a wide range of mean axial loads, the plots based on the stress range suffer from less scatter of data about the fitted line, and despite the extra efforts involved, the concept of equivalent load range does not offer any practical advantages.

TI  - Model predictive control of wave energy converters with prediction error tolerance
AB  - Sea wave energy converter (WEC) control is a non-causal optimal control problem, and the control performance relies on the accuracy of the prediction of incoming wave profile and the fidelity of the control-oriented model. To maximize energy conversion in real scenario, three issues should be fully considered: (a) the existing wave prediction methods inevitably introduce prediction errors, which degrades the control performance; (b) the model mismatch between the linearized state-space model and the hydrodynamic model also affects the control performance; (c) safe operations with limited power take-off (PTO) should be ensured to rule out the possibility of device damages. To explicitly deal with these problems, this paper proposes a novel control scheme to maximize the energy output subject to inaccurate predictions, model mismatch and multiple constraints. This is achieved by applying a feedback model predictive control (MPC) to handle the constraints and a compensator to cope with the prediction error and model mismatch. Due to the extra compensation input, the state and input constraints of MPC subsystem are further tightened to ensure constraints on both the states and the control input to be satisfied. Theoretical proof and simulation results show that the proposed controller is robust to achieve the maximal energy output subject to inaccurate prediction and inaccurate control-oriented model.

TI  - Numerical modeling of internal waves and their influence on deepwater floating systems
AB  - Internal waves occur due to a combination of density stratification, bathymetry, and tidal effects and have been observed in many parts of the world. Recent discoveries of oil and gas reserves in areas where these phenomena are prominent have caused concern for field development. There have been several incidents where adverse effects were reported due to the effect of these waves on offshore platforms. This paper studies the effects of these waves on tension leg platforms (TLPs) and semi-submersible platforms within a coupled analysis framework. The physics is modeled by the second order Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation obtained by simplification and scaling of the Boussinesq approximation. A solution involving Jacobian elliptic functions coupled with a structure function that captures the effect of the pycnocline is utilized to model the wave. The model is implemented in a coupled analysis framework, and time domain simulations are performed to study the effects on a TLP and Semi configured to the developmental requirements and environmental conditions of an internal wave prominent area. Previous results showing the effects of internal waves on Spar platforms are also presented for comparison purposes. Two different internal waves with heights of 90m and 170m are utilized for the study. The impact of these waves on platform motion, tendon and mooring line tension are presented in this paper. The study could provide guidance on platform selection in areas where the phenomenon is prominent. In addition the model adopted in this study has the advantage of capturing temporal effects of internal wave trains making it an effective model for advance warning systems with real time monitoring.

TI  - Upscaling and levelized cost of energy for offshore wind turbines supported by semi-submersible floating platforms
AB  - This study aimed to clarify upscaling and levelized cost of energy for offshore wind turbines supported by semi-submersible floating platform. Firstly, the upscaling rules of turbines, floaters and mooring lines are investigated, and the upscaling procedure is proposed based on the construction constraints and the static balance. Then, floater models are upscaled for 5, 10 MW turbines based on the semi-submersible floater for 2 MW turbine designed in Fukushima FORWARD project. By performing dynamic analyses, it is found that, the kinematic law for floaters is satisfied in the heave direction and relaxed in the surge and pitch direction. The dynamic similarity for mooring lines is satisfied by changing the mooring line quality. Finally, the levelized cost of energy is assessed by using engineering models and experience of demonstration projects. The initial cost is reduced 45 % and 57 % respectively for 5 MW and 10 MW comparing to 2 MW turbine. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Planning the R\&D of Marine Renewable Energy Resources: Avoiding Bottlenecks and Ensuring Sustainable Development in Developing Marine Economies
AB  - Planning for the research and development (R\&D) of renewable energy resources (RERs) has not received enough attention. This paper aims to study the planning for the R\&D of RERs in order to avoid bottlenecks and ensure sustainable development in developing marine economies. We have established a triple difference model (DDD) model and a wise pig game model between the theoretical government and enterprise. The data on RERs come from the World Bank and International Energy Agency databases. We have three contributions on the basis of distinguishing between mature and immature marine RERs technologies. First, it emphasizes the importance of developing R\&D planning for marine RERs immature technology in the future. Second, the DDD model is used to empirically establish whether RERs planning has a significant positive impact on RERs' output, which explains the importance of existing RERs planning. Third, the wise pig game model is used to analyze the welfare benefits to the government brought by the R\&D planning of marine RERs which proves the importance of future RERs R\&D planning.

TI  - An Intelligent Control Scheme for Optimum Efficiency and Reduced Emission Operation of Marine Transportation System
AB  - This paper proposes an intelligent control scheme (ICS) for optimum efficiency and reduced emission operation in small marine transportation systems such as tugs, research vessels, and small scale cruiser ships. The diesel engines used in marine and other transport related applications are designed to provide optimum efficiency at a specific value of mechanical loading. Generally, these engines provide the best fuel efficiency near 80\% of their rated load and also the break specific emission of CO (carbon mono oxide) and other harmful greenhouse gases are found to be lowest at this specific amount of mechanical loading. The proposed controller makes the diesel engine to operate continuously at 80\% of loading in order to ensure an optimum efficiency operation even if the mechanical load is kept changing due to the variations and fluctuations in the ship propulsion load or electrical load. The intelligent control scheme (ICS) uses a battery bank as an energy balancing element to maintain a constant total mechanical loading on the engine shaft using a bidirectional power flow control through the battery bank thus changing effective mechanical loading on the engine for optimum efficiency operation of the marine transportation system. The output mechanical power (P) delivered by the engine on its shaft is sensed using a power sensor and compared with its optimum value in order to calculate the error. Thereafter, based on the information about the error in engine shaft power, the ICS regulates the power flow to the SPAG (single phase asynchronous generator) in such a manner that the mechanical load on the engine is restored to its optimum value immediately. The optimum efficiency operation is maintained under randomly varying mechanical power demanded by the ship propulsion system and it is also maintained under varying electrical loads in the marine transportation system. This ICS scheme has been implemented in the laboratory using a DSP controller. The detailed test results are presented to validate the claims.

TI  - A two-pronged approach to decarbonising shipping is the only way
AB  - To meet the International maritime Organization's greenhouse gas (GHG) emission targets of 2030 and 2040, the maritime industry must take a two-pronged approach, which is to grow LNG ship fleet and bunkering capacity while the complex work to develop zero-emission fuel continues. This two-track approach is important to maximizing and accelerating shipping's reduction in GHG emissions. LNG's environmental footprint is significantly better than alternative fuels, e.g., distillates and heavy fuel oils, having almost no sulfur or particulate emission and significantly less nitrous oxide emission, leading to considerably less local pollution around ports and port cities. Specifically, life-cycle assessment of GHG emissions has found LNG to be up to 33% less than traditional heavy fuel oils, a performance which includes any methane slip along the life cycle value chain. Combining LNG as a marine fuel with energy deficient design and operations can make a vessel compliant with IMO 2050 targets.

TI  - A novel approach to replacing a gravel pack completion using hydraulic screens to remove the annular gap
AB  - Achieving flow performance in openhole sand control completions often requires removal of the annular gap between the screen section and wellbore. For the first time in the industry, patented hydraulic screen technology has been used to provide wellbore support and overcome the challenges associated with gravel packing in depleted reservoirs with low operational margins. This paper demonstrates how new technology has been adopted by an operator in Norway to provide effective downhole sand control in an offshore environment faced with continuous reservoir pressure depletion. Detailed job planning and evaluation of risks when adopting new technology is described. The case study describes a producer well drilled to 2580 m, at a maximum deviation of 30Â°, and temperature approximately 90Â°C. With the sand control equipment run to depth closed ended, the liner hanger and hydraulic screens are set by surface applied pressure. When set, the screens extend radially to close the annular gap and provide wellbore support; production ports in each screen provide the flow path from the reservoir to production tubing. The liner hanger packer was set and reservoir isolation barrier valve closed in the same trip providing testable barriers, prior to displacing the well for upper completion operations. The paper outlines how adopting new technology challenges openhole gravel packing and delivers effective downhole sand control in a depleted reservoir. The operator has demonstrated savings associated to operational planning, logistics, HSE risks and rig time. Production rates meet expectations with all screens contributing to flow.

TI  - Site investigation and geotechnical design strategy for offshore wind development
AB  - The development of multi billion euro Offshore Wind Farms presents geotechnical engineers with the opportunity to create comprehensive detailed ground models incorporating a large variety of geotechnical hazards. However the political structure of renewable energy projects often leads to a fragmented development team, with no one party appointed for the whole design process. Inexperienced clients are often commissioning surveys because they think that they want to do a survey rather than for an engineering reason. This leads to unclear specification, and a resulting survey that does not add the expected value to the project. The authors demonstrate in this paper how site investigation and ground modelling practices that are followed as routine in the design cycle of onshore projects can be adapted and applied to add significant value to offshore renewable projects. This paper seeks to set out a structure for development of the ground model for offshore wind projects, and demonstrates how clients can ensure their surveys are adding value to the design strategy for their projects.

TI  - Impact ofÂ Increasing Penetration ofÂ Renewables inÂ Insular Grids: Insights fromÂ theÂ Case ofÂ Andaman andÂ Nicobar Islands
AB  - Insular grids of non-interconnected islands are heavily dependent on oil-fired generators which have high fuel costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Hence, share of renewables, like solar, are being increased in insular grids, as a cheaper and cleaner alternative. In this work, a unit commitment model has been proposed for island grids with a growing renewable share. Firstly, reserve constraints for dealing with uncertainty produced by renewables, like solar, are proposed. Secondly, a road map for analyzing the situation arising from increasing renewable penetration is proposed. The same is implemented on the insular grid of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, in order to understand the complexity associated with the inclusion of dynamic renewable sources alongside conventional generators of the island. Results demonstrate that at this current stage of technology, integration of renewables with insular grids is going to be a far more challenging affair wherein the inclusion of solar after a certain point, would result in system reliability aspect outweighing the financial and environmental benefits therein.

TI  - Updatable probabilistic evaluation of failure rates of mechanical components in power take-off systems of tidal stream turbines
AB  - This paper presents a method for the probabilistic evaluation of the failure rates of mechanical components in a typical power take-off (PTO) system of a horizontal-axis tidal stream turbine (HATT). The method is based on a modification of the method of the influence factors, when base failure rates, relevant influence factors and, subsequently, resulting failure rates are treated as random variables. The prior (i.e., initial) probabilistic distribution of the failure rates of a HATT component is generated using data for similar components from other industries, while taking into account actual characteristics of the component and site-specific operating and environmental conditions of the HATT. A posterior distribution of the failure rate is estimated numerically based on a Bayesian approach as new information about the component performance in an operating HATT becomes available. The posterior distribution is then employed to obtain the updated mean and lower and upper confidence limits of the failure rate. The proposed method is illustrated by applying it to the evaluation of the failure rates of two key components of the PTO system of a typical HATTâ€”main seal and main bearing. In particular, it is shown that uncertainty associated with the method itself has a major influence on the failure rate evaluation. The proposed method is useful for the reliability assessment of both PTO designs of new HATTs and PTO systems of operating HATTs. Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Ship wake forcing and performance of a living shoreline segment on an estuarine shoreline
AB  - Investigation of the effectiveness of Natural and Nature-Based Features (NNBF) for protecting shorelines from ship wake is increasingly important with continued development along the coast, especially when combined with sea level rise. Studies that investigate the wave energy dissipation capacity of different techniques and account for variation in context will lead to improvements and innovation in designed NNBF. Few studies have examined the performance of NNBF in protecting shorelines from ship wake. In this study of a low-sloping estuarine shoreline adjacent to a major shipping route, a natural design using coir logs and wooden staking was implemented in a T-head groin configuration. Pressure transducers and electromagnetic current meters were deployed over \& SIM;1.5 months to investigate the energy dissipation and velocity attenuation capabilities of the installation. Results indicate that ship wakes account for 25\%-50\% of the total daily energy impacting the shoreline at the study site. Peak background velocities are typically over 50\% smaller than the largest ship wake velocities. Field data and results of the fully nonlinear Boussinesq model, FUNWAVE-TVD, indicate that the installation is capable of decreasing energy impacting the shoreline by 10\%-80\% and is effective over the lower 50\% of the tidal range and when submerged up to twice its height. Elevation surveys of the site indicate accrual of sediment within the installation, suggesting wave diffraction patterns promoting further accretion at the site over time. Observations indicate that coir logs may be effective in reducing wave energy from ship wakes but may fail under storm conditions in a moderate fetch confined channel. Findings from this study illustrate the opportunities and challenges nature-based solutions face in addressing ship wakes, and their ability to protect shorelines under high energy stressors.

TI  - Recovery trajectories during state change from bare sediment to eelgrass dominance
AB  - Seagrasses are important foundation species in shallow coastal ecosystems that provide critical ecosystem services including stabilizing sediment, sequestering carbon and nutrients, and providing habitat and an energy source for a diverse fauna. We followed the recovery of functional (primary productivity, carbon and nitrogen sequestration, sediment deposition) and structural (shoot density, biomass, plant morphometrics) attributes of Zostera marina (eelgrass) meadows in replicate large plots (0.2 to 0.4 ha) restored by seeding in successive years, resulting in a chrono sequence of sites from 0 (unvegetated) to 9 yr since seeding. Shoot density was the structural metric that changed most significantly, with an initial 4 yr lag, and a rapid, linear increase in plots 6 to 9 yr after seeding. Changes in Z. marina aerial productivity, sediment organic content, and exchangeable ammonium showed a similar trend with an initial 4 yr lag period before differences were observed from initial bare sediment conditions. After 9 yr, Z. marina meadows had 20x higher rates of areal productivity than 1 to 3 yr old meadows, double the organic matter and exchangeable ammonium concentrations, 3x more carbon and 4x more nitrogen, and had accumulated and retained finer particles than bare, unvegetated sediments. These results demonstrate the reinstatement of key ecosystem services with successful large-scale restoration, although none of the parameters reached an asymptote after 9 yr, indicating that at least a decade is required for these attributes to be fully restored, even in an area with high habitat suitability. Survivorship along a depth gradient showed that similar to 1.6 m (mean sea level) is the maximum depth limit for Z. marina, which matches the `tipping point' for survival predicted for this system from a non-linear hydro dynamic/seagrass growth model.

Through numerical simulations of structures subjected to current loads, wave hydrodynamic loads and inertia loads, some useful results are gained. The results show that first scheme is simple but stress is largest of all, and second scheme is reasonable for the loads are transferred effectively, and third scheme is less stable. Thus research work provides a valuable reference for harnessing of tidal energy.

TI  - Beyond LCOE: A study of ocean energy technology development and deployment attractiveness
AB  - Ocean (wave and tidal) energy is still in the prototype testing stage, with several challenges standing between the sector's current status and the goal of commercial deployment. The study of how to reduce the cost of energy, to a level competitive with renewable energy alternatives, is an important aspect of sector development. A comprehensive PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and Environmental) analysis has been carried out to reveal the risks and uncertainties that face wave and tidal energy technology within identified themes. The purpose of the PESTLE analysis was to ascertain the factors most relevant to the reduction of the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE), and the wider commercialisation of wave and tidal energy technology. It has been shown that two separate case studies are required in order to more accurately assess the needs of the ocean energy sector. Firstly the suitability of different geographic locations for technology deployment and secondly the progress of the technology in the development cycle; the areas that require the focus of research and development activity. With the completion of both case studies, the paths towards sector development and cost effective energy production has been presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - An underwater robotics platform for hybrid AUV/ROV systems
AB  - Modern ROV and AUVs are becoming more and more capable. Traditional ROVs are enhanced by sophisticated piloting aides to improve quality and to reduce operator load, minimizing errors and increase safety. Increasingly more complex AUV operations are becoming possible which involve decision making and intervention. In many ways the line between advanced ROV and AUV is disappearing. These systems are also becoming more and more complex and therefore more expensive to develop and qualify. At the same time the demands and tasks are changing requiring vehicles of different shapes, power levels, tools and functions to cope with these. The way that has chosen to address this, to be able to quickly field new vehicles that meet customer demands in a cost effective manner, is a technology platform. Reusing hardware and software components in between ROV and AUV systems allows us to build new systems that from the start have proven performance, reliability and a large user base to build on. This, combined with open interfaces that allow customers and third party suppliers to provide their own "intelligent" functions into the system, allows rapid deployment of new systems such as resident AUV and ROV systems. This paper will present the Robotics Platform and interface philosophy along with a view of the roadmap forward. It will cover existing components and how they are used. It will discuss open interfaces and how they are used in recent projects and some views on coming developments. Â© 2018, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Mitigation capacity of an eco-friendly locally sourced surfactant for gas hydrate inhibition in an offshore environment
AB  - Gas hydrate inhibition is very key and has become more sensitive as oil and gas exploration goes into deeper terrains especially deep offshore as a result of technological advancement. Use of chemicals has been the most efficient and cost effective in these areas. These chemicals add to the cost of doing oil and gas business and also cause harm to the environment; hence, research has been going on for more eco-friendly and cost-efficient inhibitors. This study takes a look at a locally sourced surfactant as one of such inhibitors. Varying weight percentages of the LSS were screened in a locally fabricated laboratory mini flow loop of 39.4Â m with an internal diameter of 0.5 inch mounted on an external frame work. The various pressure plots (pressure vs. time, change in pressure vs. time, initial and final pressures vs. time) show that the LSS used in very small percentages performed better than the synthetic inhibitor methanol (MeOH) used in higher weight percentage than the LSS. The final pressures for MeOH for 1â€“5 wt% were 104, 111, 123, 120 and 123 psi while those of the LSS were 115, 128, 125, 127 and 131 psi, respectively, for 0.01â€“0.05 wt%, respectively. This means that the system with LSS had more stable pressure values than those of MeOH. Similarly, the change in pressure at the end of 120Â min for MeOH was 46, 39, 27, 30 and 27 psi against 35, 22, 25, 23 and 19 psi for LSS. This was an indication that more gas was used up in the system with MeOH than in the system with LSS. The mitigation capacity of the LSS in percentage was calculated to be 69.30, 80.71, 78.07, 79.82 and 83.3% for 0.01â€“0.05 wt% while MeOH had values of 59.65, 65.79, 76.32, 73.68 and 76.32% for 1â€“5 wt%, respectively. This showed that the LSS inhibited hydrates better than MeOH in all the weight percentages considered. There is need to harness and develop the LSS for gas hydrate mitigation because it performed better than MeOH which is a known toxicant to man, terrestrial and aquatic habitat.

TI  - Enhanced transfer of organic matter to higher trophic levels caused by ocean acidification and its implications for export production: A mass balance approach
AB  - Ongoing acidification of the ocean through uptake of anthropogenic CO2 is known to affect marine biota and ecosystems with largely unknown consequences for marine food webs. Changes in food web structure have the potential to alter trophic transfer, partitioning, and biogeochemical cycling of elements in the ocean. Here we investigated the impact of realistic end-of-the-century CO2 concentrations on the development and partitioning of the carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and silica pools in a coastal pelagic ecosystem (Gullmar Fjord, Sweden). We covered the entire winter-to-summer plankton succession (100 days) in two sets of five pelagic mesocosms, with one set being CO2 enriched (~760 Î¼atm pCO2) and the other one left at ambient CO2 concentrations. Elemental mass balances were calculated and we highlight important challenges and uncertainties we have faced in the closed mesocosm system. Our key observations under high CO2 were: (1) A significantly amplified transfer of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus from primary producers to higher trophic levels, during times of regenerated primary production. (2) A prolonged retention of all three elements in the pelagic food web that significantly reduced nitrogen and phosphorus sedimentation by about 11 and 9%, respectively. (3) A positive trend in carbon fixation (relative to nitrogen) that appeared in the particulate matter pool as well as the downward particle flux. This excess carbon counteracted a potential reduction in carbon sedimentation that could have been expected from patterns of nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes. Our findings highlight the potential for ocean acidification to alter partitioning and cycling of carbon and nutrients in the surface ocean but also show that impacts are temporarily variable and likely depending upon the structure of the plankton food web.

TI  - Test Scheme for VSC-HVDC System Charging and Converter Passive Deblocking Using External Power Supply Under Weak AC System Conditions
AB  - Before the offshore wind power VSC-HVDC project is put into operation, it is necessary to test the converter station system and the whole wind power system to verify whether the performance meets the design requirements. However, the connected AC system may not meet the access conditions temporarily. In order to ensure the operation time of the project, this paper proposes a passive deblocking test scheme for the converters of onshore and offshore stations with external power supply, and verifies this scheme on the RTDS simulation platform. In this scheme, the external station power supply is used to charge the converter. After the charging is finished, the power supply is disconnected, and then the deblocking command is sent to the converter. The converter relies on the energy stored in the capacitor of the sub module to complete the short-term deblocking operation. The scheme could verify the performance of the converter and related devices, and find out the potential problems in advance, so as to lay the foundation for the subsequent formal test. Â© 2021 IEEE.

TI  - Wave-to-Wire Modeling and Simulation of a Wave Energy Converter for Off-Grid and Micro-Grid Applications
AB  - This paper describes the hydrodynamic, pneumatic, and electrical modeling and simulation study performed in the development of the Healy Wave Energy Converter (HWEC). The HWEC, based on a two-body structure, consists of a flotation buoy rigidly connected to a long vertical inertial tube which is open at the top and bottom. A piston-rod assembly is enclosed and connected to the power take-off (PTO) mechanism. Due to inertia of water within the tube, relative motion between the piston and the buoy-inertia tube structure drives the PTO, which consists of an air compressor, a dynamic pressure regulator and a turbine connected to an induction generator supported by a power electronic conversion system. The induction generator is operated in both self-excitation mode using switched capacitors and external excitation mode using an inverter to generate flexible power forms and to maximize the energy yield over a wide range of wave conditions. A PLC based control system ensures balance between the generated and consumed power under all dynamic conditions. Nonlinear time-domain numerical models were developed for each subsystem. The resulting modeling framework was used to specify component requirements, select operational parameters, and evaluate system performance. The HWEC system is designed to output moderate power with high reliability. The present analysis demonstrates that the HWEC can produce and store energy over a wide range of sea states, making it highly suitable for off-grid and micro-grid applications.

TI  - Effect of oscillating water column chamber inclination on the performance of a Savonius rotor
AB  - The global power potential of the waves that hit all the coasts worldwide has been estimated to be in the order of 1 TW. On an average, each wave crest transmits 10-50 kW/m of energy and this corresponds to 15 to 20 times more energy per meter than wind or solar energies. Wave energy is environmentally friendly and is the most consistent of all the intermittent sources. While wind, solar and wave are all intermittent, wave is the most consistent. Availability of waves is 90% compared to 30% for wind and solar energy. The oscillating water column (OWC) is the most investigated wave energy converter (WEC). OWC is a partially submerged hollow structure positioned, either vertically or at an angle. The bidirectional flow of air above the water column is used to drive a turbine. Majority of the OWC devices have chambers which are perpendicular to the incident waves. These conventional OWCs suffer severely from flow separation that occurs at the sharp corners of the chamber. In order to address this issue, researchers have proposed inclining the chamber at an angle with respect to the incident waves. This improves the flow characteristics. In addition to this, the flow in the chamber which ultimately decides the turbine performance, also increases. In the present study, the effect of OWC inclination on rotor performance was numerically studied using commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code ANSYS CFX. The results highlight that the 55Â° inclined OWC showed improved performance when compared to the conventional OWC and current OWC. The maximum power for the inclined OWC was 13% higher than that recorded for the rotor in the current OWC and 28% than that recorded in the conventional OWC at mean wave condition. The 55Â° inclined OWC recorded peak rotor power of 23.2 kW which corresponded to an efficiency of 27.6% at the mean sea state. The peak power and efficiency at maximum sea state was 26.5 kW and 21.5% respectively. Higher oscillation was observed in the 55Â° inclined OWC. The combination of increased flow rate and energy in the flow lead to better performance of the 55Â° inclined OWC. Copyright Â© 2018 ASME.

The concerning issues identified are noise pollution, visual pollution, reduction in recreational fishing and swimming areas, emission of materials into the atmosphere, the brine discharge and types of disposal methods used are the main cause of pollution. The reverse osmosis (RO) method is the preferred option in modern times especially when fossil fuels are becoming expensive. The RO has other positives such as better efficiency (30-50%) when compared with distillation type plants (10-30%). However, the RO membranes are susceptible to fouling and scaling and as such they need to be cleaned with chemicals regularly that may be toxic to receiving waters. The input and output water in desalination plants have to be pre and post treated, respectively. This involves treating for pH, coagulants, Cl, Cu, organics, CO2, H2S and hypoxia. The by-product of the plant is mainly brine with concentration at times twice that of seawater. This discharge also includes traces of various chemicals used in cleaning including any anticorrosion products used in the plant and has to be treated to acceptable levels of each chemical before discharge but acceptable levels vary depending on receiving waters and state regulations. The discharge of the brine is usually done by a long pipe far into the sea or at the coastline. Either way the high density of the discharge reaches the bottom layers of receiving waters and may affect marine life particularly at the bottom layers or boundaries. The longer term effects of such discharge concentrate has not been documented but it is possible that small traces of toxic substances used in the cleaning of RO membranes may be harmful to marine life and ecosystem. The plants require saline water and thus the construction of input and discharge output piping is vital. The piping are often lengthy and underground as it is in Tugun (QLD, Australia), passing below the ground. Leakage of the concentrate via cracks in rocks to aquifers is a concern and therefore appropriate monitoring quality is needed. Leakage monitoring devices ought to be attached to such piping during installation. The initial environment impact assessment should identify key parameters for monitoring during discharge processes and should recommend ongoing monitoring with devices attached to structures installed during construction of plants.

TI  - A 100\% wind, water, sunlight (WWS) all-sector energy plan for Washington State
AB  - This study analyzes the potential and consequences of Washington State's use of wind, water, and sunlight (WWS) to produce electricity and electrolytic hydrogen for 100\% of its all-purposes energy (electricity, transportation, heating/cooling, industry) by 2050, with 80-85\% conversion by 2030. Electrification plus modest efficiency measures can reduce Washington State's 2050 end-use power demand by similar to 39.9\%, with similar to 80\% of the reduction due to electrification, and can stabilize energy prices since WWS fuel costs are zero. The remaining demand can be met, in one scenario, with similar to 35\% onshore wind, similar to 13\% offshore wind, similar to 10.73\% utility-scale PV, similar to 2.9\% residential PV, similar to 1.5\% commercial/government PV, similar to 0.65\% geothermal, similar to 0.5\% wave, similar to 0.3\% tidal, and similar to 35.42\% hydropower. Converting will require only 0.08\% of the state's land for new footprint and similar to 2\% for spacing between new wind turbines (spacing that can be used for multiple purposes). It will further result in each person in the state saving similar to\$85/yr in direct energy costs and similar to\$950/yr in health costs {[}eliminating similar to 830 (190-1950)/yr statewide premature air pollution mortalities] while reducing global climate costs by similar to\$4200/person/yr (all in 2013 dollars). Converting will therefore improve health and climate while reducing costs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A review of NOx and SOx emission reduction technologies for marine diesel engines and the potential evaluation of liquefied natural gas fuelled vessels
AB  - Due to intensive marine activities and the use of low-quality fuel oils, the marine transport accounts for a considerable part of air pollution in the transportation sector. Although ships provide the convenient transportation, they exhaust a large number of hazardous pollutants, especially nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur oxides (SOx), which have a significant side effect on environment and human health. To alleviate the impact of global shipping on the environment, international maritime organization established the more stringent emission regulations from Tier I to Tier III in order to reduce emissions from ships. As a result, various emission reduction technologies need to be developed in order to meet more stringent regulations in the future and reduce the pollutant emissions. Under this background, it is indispensable to examine the existing emission reduction technologies when exploring another possible method to reduce the pollutant emissions. Based on a significant number of related literatures, it is general to utilize the marine alternative fuels to reduce the pollutant emissions. Especially, liquid natural gas (LNG) is considered to be one of the most promising marine alternative fuels due to its economy and environmentally friendly features. This review thus aims to summarize the different emission reduction technologies of marine diesel engines through three reduction paths of fuel optimization, pre-combustion control and exhaust after-treatment. Furthermore, the utilization of LNG in the marine diesel engines are evaluated comprehensively from three aspects of environmental protection, energy structure and economic benefits. At the end, some suggestions on the future research are given based on the extensive review on the state-of-the-art literature. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Wave energy is an important marine renewable energy, the development and utilization of wave energy can effectively alleviate the energy problems caused by the shortage of conventional energy and environmental pollution. Scientific evaluation of wave energy resources is the prerequisite for the utilization of ocean energy resources. The wave energy resources in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea during the period of 1980-2018 were assessed based on the latest ERA5 data of ECMWF using the new wave energy evaluation formula. The main calculation indexes include power density, usable level frequency, rich level frequency, the coefficient of variation, and the proportion of available wave height, etc. Results show that the wave energy resources in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea have obvious seasonal feature and the resources are richer in winter and autumn and poorer in spring and summer. Winter is the best season for wave energy resource development. The wave energy enrichment areas are mainly concentrated in the outer part of the Bohai Strait, the eastern part of Chengshantou and the offshore area of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River estuary. On this basis, the key development and utilization areas of wave energy resources were determined, and these data provide reference points for wave energy resource exploitation.

TI  - Modified Cascaded H-bridge Multilevel Inverter for Hybrid Renewable Energy Applications
AB  - Renewable energy sources and technologies have the potential to provide solutions to the long-standing energy problems being faced by developing countries. The renewable energy sources like wind energy, solar energy, geothermal energy, ocean energy, biomass energy and fuel cell technology can be used to overcome energy shortage in India. This paper proposes a modified multi-level inverter (MLI) topology for Hybrid Renewable Energy Sources (HRES) and a design of hybrid solar-wind power generation model with 9-level, 13-level and 17-level inverter topologies. A HRES connected to a modified Cascaded H-Bridge Multi Level Inverter (CHB-MLI) is developed, whose switches are controlled using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. The proposed hybrid energy system model consists of 10 Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) that intend to give 17 levels of output voltage. The proposed topology performs effectively with reduced number of components and reduced Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). The performance of the proposed system is analyzed by designing the model in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. The simulation results of the proposed inverter for the HRES application are compared with the results of the existing topologies to show the effectiveness of the proposed model.

TI  - Effects of a coastal power plant thermal discharge on phytoplankton community structure in Zhanjiang Bay, China
AB  - The effects of a thermal discharge from a coastal power plant on phytoplankton were determined in Zhanjiang Bay. Monthly cruises were undertaken at four tide times during April-October 2011. There were significant differences for dominant species among seven sampling months and four sampling tides. Species diversity (H') and Evenness showed a distinct increasing gradient from the heated water source to the control zone and fluctuated during four tides with no visible patterns. Species richness, cell count and Chl a at mixed and control zones were significantly higher than heated zones, and showed tidal changes with no obvious patterns. The threshold temperature of phytoplankton species can be regarded as that of phytoplankton community at ebb slack. The average threshold temperature over phytoplankton species, cell count and Chl a, and the threshold temperature of cell count can be regarded as that of phytoplankton community at flood slack during spring and neap respectively.

TI  - Optimization and cost of energy of renewable energy system in health clinic building for a coastal area in Tamil Nadu, India using homer
AB  - The renewable energy potential of coastal areas of Tamil Nadu, India ranks among the highest in the world. The annual solar energy received is 5.0 kWh m-2 and the wind energy received is at a moderate speed (4-6 m sec-1). This study proposes optimization and cost of energy of different hybrid renewable energy system to power a health clinic in that building. The total daily health clinic load is 34.9 kWh and detailed loads are listed. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) optimization computer model for distributed power, homer is used to estimate the optimization and its cost of energy. The implementation of RE systems to supply rural health clinics will contribute to reduce both electricity generation cost and C02 emissions while improving health care and quality of life in these isolated coastal regions.

TI  - Laboratory observations and numerical modeling of the effects of an array of wave energy converters
AB  - This paper investigates the effects of wave energy converters (WECs) on water waves through the analysis of extensive laboratory experiments, as well as subsequent numerical simulations. Data for the analysis was collected during the WEC-Array Experiments performed at the O.H. Hinsdale Wave Research Laboratory at Oregon State University, in collaboration with Columbia Power Technologies, using five 1:33 scale point-absorbing WECs. The observed wave measurement and WEC performance data sets allowed for a direct computation of power removed from the wave field for a large suite of incident wave conditions and WEC array sizes. Using measured power absorption characteristics as a WEC parameterization for SWAN was developed. This parameterization was verified by comparison to the observational data set. Considering the complexity of the problem, the parameterization of WECs by only power absorption is a reasonable predictor of the effect of WECs on the far field.

TI  - H-bridge multilevel voltage source converter for direct grid connection of renewable energy systems
AB  - The conventional approach based on low-voltage converter with power frequency transformer is commonly employed for grid connection of offshore renewable power generation systems. Because of the heavy weight and large size of the transformer, the system can be expensive and complex for installation and maintenance. As an alternative approach to achieve a compact and light direct grid connection, a high-voltage converter using series connected H-bridge (SCHB) multilevel converter topology is proposed in this paper. Since the SCHB converter requires a large number of isolated and balanced DC supplies, a high frequency transformer link is employed to couple the SCHB to the single low voltage DC supply. This paper presents the design and simulation of the proposed system. Â© 2011 IEEE.

TI  - Fundamental Experiments on Surge Characteristics of Submarine Cables Connected with Offshore Wind Farms
AB  - In offshore wind farms, cables between a wind turbine and another one or a substation on the land run into mediums with different resistivity in the air, the sea and the earth. In such cases, wave distortion of a propagating surge is expected on the cable. This paper carried out a fundamental experiment to confirm influence of surrounding mediums around a submarine cable connected with an offshore wind farm using a coaxial cable which is immersed to salt sea water. Sheath currents might be affected by the components of mode 0, so-called ``earth return mode{''}, which reflects at an interface between different kinds of mediums. However, mode 0 is small in sea, because resistivity of which is quite small. On the contrary, it is necessary to consider surge propagation-characteristics of the submarine connecting cable near the mouth of a river, on a lake and so on, because resistivity of fresh water is not enough small.

TI  - Implicit assumptions underlying simple harvest models of marine bird populations can mislead environmental management decisions
AB  - Assessing the potential impact of additional mortality from anthropogenic causes on animal populations requires detailed demographic information. However, these data are frequently lacking, making simple algorithms, which require little data, appealing. Because of their simplicity, these algorithms often rely on implicit assumptions, some of which may be quite restrictive. Potential Biological Removal (PBR) is a simple harvest model that estimates the number of additional mortalities that a population can theoretically sustain without causing population extinction. However, PBR relies on a number of implicit assumptions, particularly around density dependence and population trajectory that limit its applicability in many situations. Among several uses, it has been widely employed in Europe in Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA), to examine the acceptability of potential effects of offshore wind farms on marine bird populations. As a case study, we use PBR to estimate the number of additional mortalities that a population with characteristics typical of a seabird population can theoretically sustain. We incorporated this level of additional mortality within Leslie matrix models to test assumptions within the PBR algorithm about density dependence and current population trajectory. Our analyses suggest that the PBR algorithm identifies levels of mortality which cause population declines for most population trajectories and forms of population regulation. Consequently, we recommend that practitioners do not use PBR in an EIA context for offshore wind energy developments. Rather than using simple algorithms that rely on potentially invalid implicit assumptions, we recommend use of Leslie matrix models for assessing the impact of additional mortality on a population, enabling the user to explicitly define assumptions and test their importance.

TI  - Monitoring stored CO2 to document permanence
AB  - Injection of CO2 into porous rocks deep in the subsurface intrinsically has a low risk of leakage for three reasons: (1) Although CO2 is buoyant compared to brine, layered rocks limit vertical migration. Injection zones are chosen with at least one well-qualified confining system that should isolate CO2 within the selected interval. (2) Capillary trapping of CO2 in the pore system, dissolution of CO2 into formation fluids, and sorption and reaction of CO2 with organics and minerals will further attenuate CO2 lateral or vertical migration. (3) Wells are designed to isolate fluids in the deep subsurface from the overlying water and other resources; even a poorly constructed well will greatly retard migration of stored CO2. To add certainty to the planned storage, a monitoring program can be designed to document that the plume is migrating as predicted (and therefore that the planned-storage permanence is likely) and to assess any remaining uncertainties, for example, to further reduce well leakage or off-site migration risk. In an offshore setting, time-lapse seismic is the most preferred tool. A survey collected prior to injection provides the baseline survey. Injected CO2 displaces water and also increases pressure. During repeat surveys, the resulting changes in seismic velocity are measurable. Subtracting the repeat surveys from the pre-injection survey provides a high-quality image of the areas where CO2 has migrated. Other tools of high value are downhole-pressure measurements and wireline logs used to assess the zones at which CO2 is leaving the injection well(s). Gravity surveys are also used to assess the change in fluid density as CO2 is emplaced, and seismic sensors may be of value to assess microseismic response to injection. An available suite of environmental tools can be deployed to determine if any unexpected change occurs in the overburden, sediment, and water column. Advanced deployments such as fiberoptic cables and remotely operated sensor packages may have high value. Complexities of and limitations to monitoring must be critically assessed. The material impact of loss of CO2 from storage is forward modeled to determine if tools and techniques selected are sensitive to the changes. For example, if natural gas charge is present in the subsurface, seismic change from injection of CO2 is likely to be small and may be less than noise. Only by rigorous documentation that leakage is detectable can the expected outcome, high-quality storage, be documented. New work is being undertaken to develop optimized and commercializable monitoring for storage projects in the Gulf of Mexico. This work is related to a new multiyear project assessing the suitability of nearshore Gulf of Mexico for CO2 storage. Copyright Â© 2019, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - Numerical simulation of the overtopping-ramp design of a multistage overtopping wave energy breakwater hybrid device
AB  - One type of wave energy converter is based on the overtopping concept. An example of such device is the multi-reservoir Sea Slot-Cone Generator (SSG) which is based on a simple flat breakwater ramp design. Although it is capable of functioning as both a wave-breaker and wave energy harvester, the SSG still suffers from low performance with 38 percent hydraulic efficiency. This paper presents a numerical study to further improve the performance. The present research work considers the use of convex, concave, V-shape and bridge V-shapes front ramp designs. The overtopping phenomena were simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) software known as Flow3D. The results are presented in the form of mean overtopping discharge and expected power output for each of the three reservoirs. At the end of the study, the final results showed that the highest potential power output is given by the V-Shapes design with 67 percent (56.9 kW) improvement compared to current existing SSG device, which recorded (34.1 kW) at the wave height of 2.80 meters and a wave period of 9.3 seconds.

TI  - Spatio-temporal evolution and influencing factors of net carbon sink in marine aquaculture in China
AB  - Marine aquaculture not only has considerable economic benefits, but also provides high-quality ``decarbonization space `` for carbon neutrality, which is of great significance for realizing the goal of ``double carbon ``. Using the two-stage LMDI (logarithmic mean division index) method, this paper comprehensively analyzes the mechanism of net carbon sink capacity of mariculture in China from five factors: aquaculture structure, aquaculture efficiency, aquaculture scale, competitiveness of shellfish and algae and aquaculture mode. The results show that: 1) the net carbon sink of mariculture in China has increased year by year from 2010 to 2019, with obvious heterogeneous spatial distribution characteristics in three marine economic zone. 2) The improvement of aquaculture efficiency and innovation of aquaculture model contribute the most to the increase of carbon sink, and technological progress plays an increasingly important role. 3) The weak competitiveness of shellfish and algae seriously hinders the growth rate of carbon sink, and is the main reason for the increasing tightening of carbon sink space. 4) Regional heterogeneity analysis shows that the mechanism of increasing carbon sink in marine aquaculture is regionally heterogeneous and resource-dependent. Based on these findings, strategies are proposed to emphasize the ecological values of marine aquaculture, accelerate the technological innovation of deep-sea marine aquaculture, improve the organizational system and the management level, and expand the space for marine carbon sink.

TI  - Passive acoustic monitoring of a natural CO2 seep site â€“ Implications for carbon capture and storage
AB  - Estimating the range at which an acoustic receiver can detect greenhouse gas (e.g., CO2) leakage from the sub-seabed is essential for determining whether passive acoustic techniques can be an effective environmental monitoring tool above marine carbon storage sites. Here we report results from a shallow water experiment completed offshore the island of Panarea, Sicily, at a natural CO2 vent site, where the ability of passive acoustics to detect and quantify gas flux was determined at different distances. Cross-correlation methods determined the time of arrival for different travel paths which were confirmed by acoustic modelling. We develop an approach to quantify vent bubble size and gas flux. Inversion of the acoustic data was completed using the modelled impulse response to provide equivalent propagation ranges rather than physical ranges. The results show that our approach is capable of detecting a CO2 bubble plume with a gas flux rate of 2.3 L/min at ranges of up to 8 m, and determining gas flux and bubble size accurately at ranges of up to 4 m in shallow water, where the bubble sound pressure is 10 dB above that of the ambient noise.

TI  - Ultra deep water drilling riser
AB  - In recent years, numerous exploration activities of oil and gas industry have been conducted in ultra-deep water. Global offshore industry is building systems today for drilling in even deeper water, progressively using new technologies, and significantly extending existing technologies. The technology of ultra-deep water risers, which is the main tool in drilling oil, is more and more standard. The riser system is the communication system between the vessel and the subsea well head. Through this riser, down hole equipment is guided in to the well and mud is returned to the surface. The paper addresses the key design issues looking at sizing, design of key components, material selection, analysis methods and installation issues. Limitations of current technology and application are the driving source for innovations in this field. The riser is the key element for drilling in ultra-deep water. Its architecture for deep-water drilling depends on numerous different factors related to operational and environmental conditions. These include water depth, mud weight, auxiliary line diameters and working pressures, sea states and current profiles, and maximum rig offset. All of the above parameters have to be taken into account in the design of the various riser system components including the main tube, the auxiliary lines, the connectors, the distribution of buoyancy modules, and the tensioning system. Major concerns of drilling contractors are to run and retrieve the riser fast and to operate it safely in ultra-deep water. Thus, it leads to developed methodology and new technology for expanding the range of application of risers systems and make them well suited for ultra-deep drilling in very harsh operational and oceanographic environments. The main purpose of the methodology is to optimise the riser design to determine the working envelopes. This technical paper manly focuses on the global analysis of the drilling risers.

TI  - Cooperative Control Strategy of Fundamental Frequency Modulation-Based Current Source Converters for Offshore Wind Farms
AB  - The actively commutated current source converter (CSC) does not need large energy storage capacitors and can realize the black start of wind farms, which provides a practicable scheme for the lightweight offshore wind power DC transmission system. However, resulted from utilizing pulse width modulation, the existing CSC has the disadvantages of high DC harmonics and high switching loss. To solve this problem, an offshore wind power transmission system based on the current source converter with fundamental frequency modulation employed (FFM-CSC) is investigated. Firstly, the topology and mathematical model are analyzed. Then, a steady-state control strategy coordinated by the offshore CSC and the onshore CSC is put forward, and the power operating range is researched. A black start control strategy for wind farms is also proposed. Finally, the offshore wind power transmission system is tested by simulation in PSCAD/EMTDC. The results demonstrate that the FFM-CSC-based offshore wind power transmission system can smoothly realize the black start, stably control the frequency and amplitude of AC voltage, adapt to output changes of wind turbines, and realize the fault ride-through.

AB  - Single embryo transfer is being proposed as the solution to avoid multiple pregnancies in IVF. Nevertheless, in my opinion, although this is the right solution, it is still not the correct one at the present time. Mainly, it is unfair to the majority of infertile couples and it will also severely limit the physician's capacity to resolve unfavourable IVF cases. Furthermore, current IVF technology is far from perfect and the impact of single embryo transfer needs to be evaluated in patients over 38 years of age, poor responders, and also in regard to blastocyst transfer and the development of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis.

TI  - Experimental validation of the distributed drag method for simulating large marine current turbine arrays using porous fences
AB  - Marine current energy conversion can provide significant electrical power from resource-rich sites. However since no large marine current turbine arrays currently exist, validation of methods for simulating energy extraction relies upon scaled down laboratory experiments. We present results from an experiment using porous fences spanning the width of a recirculating flume to simulate flow through large, regular, multi-row marine current turbine arrays. Measurements of fence drag, free surface elevation drop and velocity distribution were obtained to validate a method for parameterising array drag in the distributed drag approach, which is typically implemented in regional scale models. The effect of array density was also investigated by varying the spacing between fences. Two different inflow conditions were used; the first used the flume bed in its natural state, whilst the second used roughness strips on the flume bed to significantly enhance ambient turbulence intensity to levels similar to those recorded at tidal sites. For realistic array densities (<0.07), a depth averaged formulation of effective array drag coefficient agreed within 10% of that derived from experimental results for both inflow conditions. The validity of the distributed drag approach was shown to be dependent on longitudinal row spacing between porous fences and ambient turbulence intensity, two features that determine the level of wake recovery downstream of each porous fence. Finally a force balance analysis quantified the change in bed drag as a result of the presence of porous fence arrays. Adding arrays to the flow gave an increase in bed drag coefficient of up to 95% which was 20% of the total added bed and array drag coefficient. Results have implications for regional scale hydrodynamic modelling, where array layout along with site specific characteristics such as turbulence intensity and bed profile determine the validity of the distributed drag approach for simulating energy extraction.

TI  - A review of the status of wind energy utilisaton in Nigeria
AB  - The paper looked into the wind energy potentials, and the extent to which these potentials were utilized in Nigeria for a sustainable environment. Reviews of past literature, reports on the subject, as well as physical survey were used to collect materials in order to accomplish this work. The paper will contribute in developing wind energy technology and utilization of wind resources across the country. From the findings, it was established that Nigeria is blessed with enormous opportunities for harnessing wind for various applications more specifically in the core northern region of Nigeria, hilly parts of the eastern, central, and offshore areas which signifies around 86% of the likely over-all yearly wind energy flux density for the Nigeria. It was also found out that wind energy utilization in the country is faced with challenges such as absence of local manufacturing for wind energy components, reluctance of government to encourage wind technologies, lack of offshore wind mapping, and low financing. The paper recommends that Government of Nigeria through its various agencies should develop more wind farm sites across the country, establish local manufacturing industries for wind energy systems, create enabling environment for investors to widen research activities.

TI  - Performance assessment of the full scale ISWEC system
AB  - ISWEC (Inertial Sea Wave Energy Converter) is a system using the gyroscopic reactions provided from a spinning flywheel to extract power from sea waves. The flywheel and the energy conversion systems works inside the sealed floating body thus being protected from the marine environment to obtain reliable and durable operation. The goal of this work is to identify a strategy to optimize the performance of the ISWEC and to introduce a mathematical tool suitable for this purpose. The control of the device aims to exploit all the available control parameters in order to maximize power generation. At first the tuning of PTO control law is analyzed and then the additional control degree provided by the gyro speed is considered too. The control strategies are identified with a constrained multivariable optimization algorithm taking into account the device physical limits. The system analyzed in the present work is a 100 kW ISWEC device deployed at the Island of Pantelleria, Italy. Â© 2015 IEEE.

TI  - An innovative design of wave energy converter
AB  - The aim of this research is to develop an innovative approach for electric power conversion of the vast ocean wave energy. A floating-buoy wave energy converter (WEC) using hydrostatic transmission (HST), which is shortened as HSTWEC, has been proposed to enhance the wave energy generation from wave fluctuations. In the HSTWEC device, the power take-off system (PTO) was combined with an HST circuit and an electric generator to convert the mechanical energy generated by wave energy into electrical energy. Design concept and working principle of the HST circuit were firstly derived. Next, a mathematical model, control concepts and selections of main components of the HSTWEC system has been carried out for an adequate investigation of the suggested system. Finally, simulations using MATLAB/Simulink and AMESim software have been performed in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed HSTWEC. The simulation results show that more than 65% of wave energy can be absorbed by using the HSTWEC device. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Reliability Evaluation of Multi-Energy Generation and Transmission System With Offshore Wind Power-Photovoltaic-Energy Storage
AB  - The wind-solar-load correlation model is the basis for accurately evaluating the reliability of offshore wind power-photovoltaic-energy storage grid connected system. To solve the problem of high-dimensional wind-solar-load correlation modeling, a hybrid time-varying Copula model based on vine structure was proposed. By combining the actual wind farm output, photovoltaic power station output and grid load data, eight wind-solar-load combined Copula models were established, and the proposed model had more advantages than other models by using two common evaluation criteria of optimal model. Taking the measured data of wind farms and photovoltaic stations in Shandong province as examples, eight groups of models were analyzed and compared in IEEE-RTS79 system with wind farms and photovoltaic stations. The results show that the proposed Copula function model can more accurately describe the multi-dimensional wind-solar-load correlation. However, other existing models underestimate the impact of the wind-solar-load correlation on system reliability. After adding the energy storage device to the test system, other models also have deviations in the selection of the optimal wind-solar installed capacity ratio, the selection of storage power station capacity and the evaluation of power fluctuation.

TI  - Monetization of associated gases from offshore oil fields by electrical power
AB  - Oil fields always contain a mix of product including associated gases. Flaring these gases is now prohibited and in locations offshore, their management can be challenging. These gases can be used in onsite energy production. But in most cases, the amount of produced gas largely exceeds platform fuel gas requirement. Exporting this gas by a subsea pipeline can be quite costly, particularly as water depth increases. Converting this potential energy offshore in electricity and export it by an HVDC link can be a way to monetize this gas production. This article proposes to make a review of the technology and its maturity to satisfy this objective.

TI  - Wave and current measurements for offshore windfarms
AB  - The measurement of waves, has been one difficult problem in observing the wave climate offshore. A crucial element in the development of any numerical model is its validation. Suitable measuring methods could be an ADP - Acoustic Doppler Profiler, a directional buoy, an array of pressuresensors, an ultrasonic device or an echo-sounder. Because of the resulting physical effects which may influence the wave measurement it is important to know how the applied device work. Due to the attenuation of the wave induced pressure signal with depth pressure-based underwater measurements have to be done with a sensor of suited effective range. In this regard the selected installation depth of the sensor or the sensor array is of great importance - the number of the pressure sensors in one array determines the directional resolution of the wave measurement. Direct measurements with movable devices such as a buoy are affected by unwanted acceleration signals as a result of the movement of the water surface. Especially when dealing with wave parameters like the Significant Wave Height (SWH) or the Wave Period. It is also fundamental to know whether the outputted signal is a real measured time series, e.g. the oscillation of the water surface (buoy) or a result of a spectral calculation (ADP). Even the mathematical methods behind the spectral results should be known exactly because little uncertainties there can cause great differences compared to a real-time measurement. Another important aspect is the definition of the measured parameter itself, e.g. the SWH.....

TI  - Rapid assessments of hydrate blockage risk in oil-continuous flowlines
AB  - As industry moves toward the production of oil and gas resources in deep offshore environments, the prospective formation of natural gas hydrates under low temperature, high-pressure conditions poses an increasing risk of pipeline blockage. Successful management of this risk requires a precise forecast of the hydrate growth rate. Such predictions should incorporate quantitative descriptions of both deterministic and probabilistic hydrate phenomena. In this work, we present a first step towards such a quantitative risk assessment for systems that form hydrate slurries, based on a consideration of the stochastic nature of hydrate formation. Our framework introduces a new approach to risk assessment, by coupling a laboratory-derived probabilistic nucleation model with existing deterministic calculations for hydrate slurry viscosification. This new approach is used to extend a previously-described hydrate risk algorithm, the Hydrate Flow Assurance Simulation Tool (HyFAST), which enables the rapid assessment of hydrate slurry viscosification using the most advanced models available. Importantly, while the previous version of HyFAST was constrained to calculations in flowloop and autoclave geometries, for which it is sufficient to consider a single volume element, the new version of the HyFAST algorithm allows calculations for flowlines wherein a series of multiple volume elements are considered. The advanced hydrate formation models within this algorithm allow identification of critically important hydrate formation scenarios, and may serve as a screening tool for cases that then require study within rigorous hydrodynamic packages such as OLGA (R) or LedaFlow (R) to examine behaviour during key transient events. By coupling the outputs of our predictive algorithm and quantitative risk framework, we demonstrate a new capability to assess what constitutes an acceptable level of hydrate formation. We use this algorithm in a series of case studies that compare the effectiveness of common hydrate mitigation strategies over the life of a reservoir, including the optimization of a wellhead choke opening for both production rate and hydrate blockage risk.

TI  - Assessing source contributions to particulate organic matter in a subtropical estuary: A biomarker approach
AB  - Assessing the sources and quantifying the contributions of particulate organic matter (POM) in estuaries is a challenge. Here we apply source-specific biomarkers to assess POM sources in an estuary receiving suspended material from freshwater wetlands, fringe mangroves and coastal environments. A three end-member mixing model, including terrestrial, estuarine and marine end-member contributions was developed and successfully validated to assess general OM dynamics and hydrologic processes that control POM distributions within the Shark River estuary in South Florida. Low tide and wet season conditions coincided with an enhanced signal of the freshwater end-member biomarker abundance, while high tide and dry season conditions resulted in enhanced POM input of marine origin. Incoming tide was observed to be an important factor in the re-suspension and tidal pumping of mangrove-derived POM, which seems to be the dominant source of particulate organic carbon (POC) in the estuary. The three end-member conceptual model was tested to obtain a rough estimate of POC source strength, with the ultimate goal of constraining carbon budgets in this sub-tropical estuary. Mangrove-derived POC flux of ca. 5.3Ã—105 to 1.0Ã—106kg/yr POC from the Shark River to the Gulf of Mexico were estimated, but end-member values used in the assessment need to be better constrained to reduce the degree of variability.

TI  - Method for prediction of ship traffic behaviour and encounter frequency
AB  - The design of new rules on seaways, such as traffic restrictions, requires determining the degree of improvement in marine traffic safety beforehand by considering the occurrence of new hazardous factors. This study proposes a method to predict the future traffic behaviour and ship encounter frequency (EF) with the introduction of a new traffic rule. First, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify the factors affecting the EF. A method of predicting future traffic behaviour and EF is presented based on the analysis of changes in the traffic flow in an area with a temporal restriction. Results show that the method appropriately predicts the location and degree of the occurrence of encounters in the sea area. The proposed method contributes to the discussion of future traffic safety, when sailing in a specific area is restricted by new regulations, installations of new offshore wind farms and fishing reefs.

TI  - Dynamic Analysis of a Tripod Offshore Wind Turbine under Earthquakes
AB  - Earthquakes are non-negligible hazards for the designing of offshore wind farms in the coastal regions of China, such as Bohai Bay. So, it is necessary to analyze the response of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) under earthquakes. Fluid mechanics are applied to the model, the interactions of sea water and the substructure are based on fluid theory analysis in this paper. Moreover, it takes into account of the influence of fluid-solid coupling effect, radiation effect of wave loads and pile-soil interactions on the OWT. By establishing the finite element model (FEM) and dynamic equation of a tripod OWT, the measured onshore and offshore seismic waves are applied in the finite element analysis of the Tripod OWT respectively, and the numerical analysis of a tripod OWT structure under different measured seismic waves is carried out. More detailed comparison of the differences between onshore and offshore seismic waves is carried out in the paper. The result shows that the offshore seismic waves stimulate more significant responses than the onshore one, which can be attributed to that abundant seismic frequencies are found around the fundamental frequencies of the OWT. the seismic response analysis is conservative by using the onshore seismic waves, however, using the offshore seismic waves is closer to the actual situation.

Their reduced environmental impact complies with the public concern on the compatibility of electrical infrastructures in residential areas. The lower fault rate of high voltage DC (HVDC) cables matches the need of transmission and distribution system operators for high reliability in power delivery [1], [2], and sometimes they are the only solution, e.g., submarine links. In general, the growing demand and dependency on offshore produced renewable energy makes submarine cables essential, and they have become critical infrastructures for the reliable delivery of electrical power [1]-[3].

TI  - Thermal-hydraulic analysis of a lead-bismuth small modular reactor under moving conditions
AB  - The application of lead-bismuth small modular reactor (SMR) has unique advantages in offshore engineering. Moving conditions caused by ocean environment are important for the security analysis of nuclear system. In this paper, the models including core neutronics, reactor thermal hydraulics and moving conditions for a natural circulation lead-bismuth reactor with thermal power of 5 MW are established. The calculation results show that (a) inclination causes core flowrate reduction and coolant temperature rise at the core outlet, maximum of which can be 20\% and 20 degrees C. (b) Heaving and rolling conditions both result in fluctuation of core mass flow rate and fuel cladding temperature while pattern of each differs. Flowrate fluctuation larger than 10\% of the steady state happens under large heaving condition. Backflow appears in the heat exchanger if the rolling condition is strong enough. (c) Lead-bismuth SMR is influenced more intensely under heaving and rolling condition compared with small PWR. 18\% larger mass flowrate fluctuation appears in the lead-bismuth SMR under heaving acceleration of 0.5 g. Opposite trend of time-domain average core flowrate appears for two reactors under rolling condition. This study provides theoretical basis for the thermal-hydraulic system analysis of lead-bismuth SMR under moving conditions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ocean carbon sequestration: Particle fragmentation by copepods as a significant unrecognised factor? Explicitly representing the role of copepods in biogeochemical models may fundamentally improve understanding of future ocean carbon storage
AB  - Ocean biology helps regulate global climate by fixing atmospheric CO2 and exporting it to deep waters as sinking detrital particles. New observations demonstrate that particle fragmentation is the principal factor controlling the depth to which these particles penetrate the ocean's interior, and hence how long the constituent carbon is sequestered from the atmosphere. The underlying cause is, however, poorly understood. We speculate that small, particle-associated copepods, which intercept and inadvertently break up sinking particles as they search for attached protistan prey, are the principle agents of fragmentation in the ocean. We explore this idea using a new marine ecosystem model. Results indicate that explicitly representing particle fragmentation by copepods in biogeochemical models offers a step change in our ability to understand the future evolution of biologically-mediated ocean carbon storage. Our findings highlight the need for improved understanding of the distribution, abundance, ecology and physiology of particle-associated copepods.

TI  - Impacts of CO2-induced seawater acidification on coastal Mediterranean bivalves and interactions with other climatic stressors
AB  - The effects of seawater acidification caused by increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), combined with other climatic stressors, were studied on 3 coastal Mediterranean bivalve species: the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and the clams Chamelea gallina and Ruditapes decussatus. CO2 perturbation experiments produced contrasting responses on growth and calcification of juvenile shells, according to species and location. In the Northern Adriatic (Italy), long-term exposure to reduced pH severely damaged the shells of M. galloprovincialis and C. gallina and reduced growth for the latter species. Seawater in the Ria Formosa lagoon (Portugal) was consistently saturated in carbonates, which buffered the impacts on calcification and growth. After 80 days, no shell damage was observed in Portugal, but mussels in the acidified treatments were less calcified. Reduced clearance, ingestion and respiration rates and increased ammonia excretion were observed for R. decussatus under reduced pH. Clearance rates of juvenile mussels were significantly reduced by acidification in Italy, but not in Portugal. Both locations showed a consistent trend for increased ammonia excretion with decreasing pH, suggesting increased protein catabolism. Respiratory rates were generally not affected. Short-term factorial experiments done in Italy revealed that acidification caused alterations in immunological parameters of adult bivalves, particularly at temperature and salinity values far from the optimal for the species in the Mediterranean. Overall, our results showed large variations in the sensitivities of bivalves to climatic changes, among different species and between local populations of the same species. Expectations of impacts, mitigation and adaptation strategies have to consider such local variability.

TI  - Factors influencing the organic carbon pools in tidal marsh soils of the Elbe estuary (Germany)
AB  - Purpose Soils of tidal marshes play an important role in regional carbon (C) cycles as they are able to store considerable amounts of organic carbon (OC). However, the C dynamics of marsh soils of the Elbe estuary have not been investigated so far. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the sources and distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) and the factors influencing the SOC pools of tidal marshes of the study region. Materials and methods In this study, SOC pools were determined in different salinity zones and elevation classes of the estuarine marshes. The amount of initial allochthonous OC was derived from the OC content in fresh sediments. The difference to the recent OC content in the soils was interpreted as autochthonous accumulation or mineralization by microorganisms. Results and discussion Young, low marshes of the study sites seem to be predominantly influenced by allochthonous OC deposition whereas the older, high marshes show autochthonous OC accumulation in the topsoils (0-30 cm) and mineralization in the subsoils (30-70 cm). SOC pools of the whole profile depth (0-100 cm) did not significantly differ between elevation classes, but decreased significantly with increasing salinity from 28.3 kg m(-2) in the most upstream site of the oligohaline zone to 9.7 kg m(-2) in the most downstream site of the polyhaline zone. Even though the areal extent of the investigated salinity zones was similar, the SOC mass within 100 cm soil depth decreased from 0.62 Tg (1 Tg = 10(12) g) in the oligohaline zone to 0.18 Tg in the polyhaline zone. Conclusions Elevation was found to be one factor influencing the SOC pools of tidal marshes. However, salinity seems to be an even stronger influencing factor reducing the above-ground biomass and, accordingly, the autochthonous OC input as well as the allochthonous input by enhanced mineralization of OC along the course of the estuary. An upstream shift of the salinity zones by sea level rise could, therefore, lead to a reduction of the SOC storage of the estuarine marshes.

TI  - AUTONOMOUS PHOTOVOLTAIC ELECTRICITY GENERATING SYSTEM FOR SHIPS MOORING AT PORTS AS AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY SOLUTION
AB  - Around the world, there is an increasing interest in how to reduce the negative impact of ships mooring in ports on the environment. It is necessary to find new solutions of this problem. One of them can be use of an autonomous electricity generating system on ships with photovoltaic cells. The main source of air pollutants emission by ships mooring in ports are marine generating sets. The generators are driven by marine diesel engines called auxiliary engines. Shut down of marine generating sets and change of electricity source for photovoltaic cells panels leads to reduction of air pollutants emission. It is important to estimate the electric power demand by ships mooring in ports and calculate the area of photovoltaic cells panels using solar energy. The specificity of cargo ship construction, first of all bulk-carriers, allows to install on cargo-hold covers large area of photovoltaic cells panels. The main technical problem in that case deals with storage of electric energy generated by photovoltaic cells panels and conversion of the energy. The authors propose the solution that can lead to design of whole system and significant reduction of air pollutants emission by ships mooring in ports.

TI  - Trade and trade-offs: Shipping in changing climates
AB  - This paper addresses the evolution of maritime transport demand in response to global climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. The complexity of the global shipping system makes predicting volumes and patterns of long-term future international maritime trade a challenging task which is best explored by building scenarios rather than `precise' forecasts. We present four contrasting scenarios of international maritime trade out to 2050, available in high resolution in terms of the dimensions studied (regions, countries, commodities, decades), which are consistent with high and low levels of global CO2 mitigation and associated climate impacts. The scenarios project trade increasing to between two and four times the 2010 value by 2050. Scenarios characterised by low temperature increases and material intensity lead to the lower bound trade increase with high trade growth in bioenergy commodities. Unfettered production growth across countries, high temperature increases and material intensity lead to a quadrupling of trade across energy, containerised, dry and wet commodities. The estimated range is lower than those in existing scenarios and forecasts in which globalisation is assumed to continue apace. The scenarios which project the highest growth presupposes both limited decarbonisation (in contrast to the Paris Agreement) and continued growth in expanding markets. The scenarios therefore become a valuable policy and decision-making tool to address technological and operational change required of the shipping sector, if it is to deliver mitigation in line with the Paris Agreement.

TI  - Efficient visual monitoring of offshore windmill installations with online image annotation and deep learning computer vision
AB  - The number of offshore windmills keeps growing around the world since they are an essential part of any strategy to produce energy without using nuclear power plants or burning fossil resources. Due to the growing number of installations new monitoring and inspection strategies and routines need to be developed that are not only effective but efficient. In this work we will present first results from a joint project of industry partners and academia that aims at the development of new approaches making use of modern imaging technologies and new methods from artificial intelligence and computer vision research. We investigate three different strategies for collecting digital photos or video and posterior computational analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our results indicate, that patterns of interest like rust or coating damage can be detected and classified with F-1 scores between 0.80 and 0.94 in photos collected by inspectors. In videos collected with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) rust patterns, oils spills and coating damage were detected with F-1 = 0.91. To support users in the time-consuming task of visual data exploration, we present a new visualization method referred to as ``virtual twin{''}. Using hand recorded image collections, a data-driven 3D model of a windmill is generated, that can be used to investigate damage patterns in the full context of the windmill and in full detail. Altogether our results indicate, that although each single approach has its limitations, a combination of different imaging methods, deep learning computer vision algorithms and sophisticated visual data exploration by experienced users appears to have potential to overcome the bottleneck in data analysis, interpretation and decision making in the context of the future inspections of offshore windmills, platforms or other constructions.

TI  - On prediction method of optimized control parameters for an array of point absorber type wave energy converters in waves
AB  - Using marine renewable energy can contribute providing the energy instead of using fossil fuel. There are some types of marine renewable energy. Wave energy is one of these and no one doubts its vast potential once they glance the sea. The object of this paper is an array of Point Absorber Wave Energy Converters (PA-WECs). In the array, hydrodynamic interactions among the array will be increase. When we consider the maximization of generated electric power of the array, the suitable choice of the control force of the generator is the key. In the past research, as for the detection of the suitable control force of the single PA-WEC it has been shown the analytical solution within linear system. In this paper, we show the analytical solution of the control force parameter for maximizing the generated electric power of the array taking the hydrodynamic interaction among the array both in diffraction and radiation problem into account. Then we carried out the numerical examination and discussed the validation of the proposed formulation and the good arrangement of an array in waves based on the proposed formulation. Â© 2018 IEEE

TI  - CO2 release in deep ocean by moving ship
AB  - This chapter illustrates that the moving-ship type of CO2 ocean storage is a concept whereby captured and liquefied CO2 is delivered by ship to a site and injected into the ocean depths by means of a pipe suspended beneath it as it slowly moves through the water. In addition to the horizontal movement of the release point, the rising and gradual dissolving behavior of CO2 droplets contributes to the dilution of CO2 in seawater. From the point of view of dilution, deeper injection and faster movement of the release point are preferable, and a technology to make droplets of an appropriate initial size is needed to control the distance of the vertical journey of CO2 droplets. It discusses that the engineering feasibility of a long pipe suspended and towed by a moving ship is first investigated. A streamlined nozzle for making droplets of an appropriate initial size is designed and examined in a towing tank and also in a high-pressure tank. The terminal velocity of a rising CO2 droplet under deep ocean circumstances is measured in a high-pressure tank taking into direct account the influence of a covering hydrate film. Finally, a numerical case study is performed to assess the effects of initial CO2 droplets on the plume dynamics, implementing the observation data taken from the experiments to a two-fluid CO2 plume evolution model.

TI  - GIS-Based Site Analysis of an Optimal Offshore Wind Farm for Minimizing Coastal Disasters
AB  - Ryu, G.H.; Kim, H.; Kim, Y.-G.; Chon, K.-H.; Joo, J.Y., and Moon, C.-J., 2021. GIS-based site analysis of an optimal offshore wind farm for minimizing coastal disasters. In: Lee, J.L.; Suh, K.-S.; Lee, B.; Shin, S., and Lee, J. (eds.), Crisis and Integrated Management for Coastal and Marine Safety. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 114, pp. 246-250. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. The horizontal force transmitted to the turbine and the substructure of a wind power system is very important factor in system safety, and such a system is particularly vulnerable to large-scale coastal disasters such as earthquakes and typhoons. Wind power systems built offshore and on coasts have reduced economic efficiency due to the increase in initial investment costs, because they require a more robust design when installed in areas vulnerable to coastal disasters. The western and southern seas of Korea have a relatively shallow water depth, which is advantageous for the construction of offshore wind farms. However, since it is close to the Pacific Rim, the probability of an earthquake is relatively high compared to those in other regions, and the frequency of typhoons is higher as well, so a more detailed site analysis is necessary. In this study, the GIS technique was used to select an optimal site for wind farms with a focus on reducing the risk of coastal disasters. The current state of earthquakes in the western and southern seas of Korea as well as the movement path and intensity of typhoons affecting or passing through the western and southern seas were also analyzed in a complex manner. As a result, an optimal site for an offshore wind farm with the lowest risk of coastal disasters was analyzed. Â© 2021 Coastal Education Research Foundation Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study conducted a comparative analysis of system performance between Sea Waves-Hydroelectric Power Plant (SW-HPP) and Beach Waves -Hydroelectric Power Plant (BW-HPP) as a source of renewable electrical energy as the source of raw water for shrimp ponds, milkfish and salt farmers by taking research sites on the coastal coast of Marunda Cilincing, North Jakarta. Using the comparative method by comparing the parameters of pump force, water inlet speed, pump inlet pressure, water inlet velocity, pump inlet pressure, water discharge, turbine power and electric power generated. Assuming a sea wave height of 2 meters, a 4 second wave period, linear waves and turbine efficiency of 0.88. The results showed that both systems are very suitable as a source of renewable energy generation and raw water for shrimp or milkfish ponds in north Jakarta Marunda Beach. With the same system size, PLTA-GL generates more electricity than PLTA-OP. Increasing the capacity and availability of water in the PLTA-GL reservoir can be done by installing 3 pump units and 1 turbine generator unit. Increasing the power capacity of the PLTA-OP unit can be done by increasing the coverage of the trap unit.

TI  - Distributed cooperative control research of doubly fed wind turbine groups in offshore wind farms
AB  - A distributed cooperative control strategy for doubly fed wind turbine groups in the offshore wind farms was proposed, which was based on Hamilton energy theory to make the closed-loop system globally stable and output synchronous. The single-machine model of doubly fed wind turbines was extended to a cluster model with the network topology of wind farms. And the distributed cooperative control was constructed by using the design method of distributed Hamilton systems. Furthermore, considering the actual conditions of the input energy of the practical systems, the distributed cooperative control design method with bounded input was proposed to guarantee the global stability and the output synchronization of the closed-loop system. The simulation results show that the distributed cooperative control strategy improves the adaptability of closed-loop systems, and has good control effects under the constraints of bounded input.

TI  - Contribution of the seagrass Syringodium isoetifolium to the metabolic functioning of a tropical reef lagoon
AB  - Seagrasses are gaining attention thanks to their metabolism and potential major role as carbon sinks, with further implications as nature-based solutions against climate change. Despite their recognized importance and the growing number of studies published, there is still a striking paucity of information on seagrass metabolism and contribution to biogeochemical cycles for some seagrass species and ocean areas. In this study we assessed the metabolic balance and nutrient cycling contribution of seagrasses to the benthic compartment of a tropical reef lagoon in Reunion Island, providing original information on a barely studied seagrass species (Syringodium isoetifolium) and a poorly studied ocean region (West Indian Ocean). We measured the net productivity, respiration and the metabolic balance in different components of the lagoon benthic compartment (i.e. seagrass, sediment, and benthic community) and the water-sediment nutrient benthic fluxes at differently impacted sites within the lagoon. The biogeochemical environmental variability, including inorganic and organic indicators of anthropogenic contamination, was also assessed at each site.Large spatial variability was detected in the metabolic balance of each benthic component assessed, also associated with the natural and/or anthropic-driven environmental variability found in the lagoon. The seagrass S. isoetifolium was net autotrophic across the lagoon and contributed to the lagoon benthic metabolism with net plant productivity exceeding by one order of magnitude the plant respiration. The lowest seagrass metabolism was detected at the impacted site. The metabolic balance of the sediment was heterotrophic but the high productivity of S. isoetifolium contributed to reducing the heterotrophy of the whole benthic community. The lagoon-wide benthic metabolic balance was slightly heterotrophic, but the associated uncertainty ranged from autotrophy to heterotrophy. Nutrient concentrations in the lagoon were low and the benthic community capacity for nutrient retention (uptake) and removal (denitrification and anammox) indicated potential for buffering moderate nutrient inputs into the lagoon. Organic contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) were low but detectable in the lagoon, especially in highly frequented beach areas, arising as an environmental quality indicator of interest.

TI  - Shellfish culture in the open ocean: Lessons learned for offshore expansion
AB  - Marine shellfish or bivalve aquaculture accounts for a large fraction of the total world production of cultured seafood, with production trailing only freshwater fish (mainly carps and similar species) and aquatic plants. However, growth of nearshore bivalve aquaculture is increasingly constrained by space, economics, human health, and environmental concerns. Offshore or open ocean waters offer a tremendous potential for expansion of the shellfish farming. Developments to date indicate that it is feasible to install, to maintain, and to operate bivalve culture systems in high-energy offshore waters with production rates often equaling or exceeding nearshore environments. Although production to date is limited and a number of technical, operational, economic, and social challenges must be addressed, a number of small to large-scale bivalve culture systems are in development or production. This article reviews the current production of bivalve shellfish, describes characteristics through case examples of offshore shellfish culture system, and assesses the future potential of this farming method.

TI  - Induction bent pipe in the Offshore industry
AB  - The U.S. capability and capacity to form bends from high strength pipeline steels (X-grades) has been greatly expanded in the last few years. The induction bending process offers many advantages over conventional bending processes (hot slab and cold bending). Numerous API-5LX pipeline steels, including grades X42 through X70, have been successfully bent. Complete mechanical testing, including notch toughness at temperatures from +32Â°F., 0Â°F., -20Â°F. and -50Â°F. have been obtained. Through extensive developmental work on the various X-grades, it has been shown that the original mechanical properties of the pipe can be maintained, and, in some cases, enhanced. Research into the basic mechanisms of the induction bending process highlights the importance of controlling the starting pipe chemistry, and also points out that bending speed and temperature are significant. Evaluation of the metallurgical structures that result from various pipe chemistries and bending parameters has verified which structures will result in the appropriate mechnical properties. Knowledge and control of all these factors assures the reliability and repeatability of induction bends, especially in critical environments such as sour gas and low temperature. Offshore applications, such as riser bends and complex expansion loops, will be discussed. Â© 1982 Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - The use of dope-free tubulars in offshore operations: Experiences and benefits
AB  - The use of dope-free tubulars in offshore operations has been increasingly adopted by different operators since its debut in the North Sea in 2003. Dope-free tubulars replace the storage and running pipe dope historically used in casing and tubing by a dry coating applied on pipe threads in an industrial controlled environment. The elimination of dope greatly simplifies the supply chain process involved in preparing casing and tubing for offshore wells, thus increasing efficiency and safety, and lessening the environmental impact of the process. The main benefits of this technology are: improved operational efficiency - preparation, running, pulling, management of rig returns; reliability: connections are made up in a more consistent and repetitive manner as the coating is applied as part of an industrial process replacing a manual operation; improved well productivity: eliminating the damage to the formation created by the pipe dope; and reduced impact on Health, Safety & Environment. Operators' experience, after a short learning curve, showed great reductions in running time, fewer connection re-make-ups and rejects, better workers' Health & Safety conditions thanks to the elimination of unsafe tasks and the creation of cleaner work areas, and a lesser environmental impact. This paper describes the experiences and benefits of using dope-free tubulars in offshore operations in the main offshore oilfields, including the North Sea, the Barents Sea, Brazil, Indonesia, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Persian Gulf.

TI  - Tank test results and numerical prediction of structural response of an innovative TLP for offshore wind turbines
AB  - The Offshore Wind Resources in deep water, but also the currently experienced issues with conventional foundations, are driving the solution requirements for new offshore wind power platforms. The latest monitoring results of German offshore wind farms show the challenges the industry is facing. Ecological impacts as well as foundation technology issues are forcing the sector to look for alternatives. The presentation will introduce a technology of a floating TLP-structure with a specific mooring line configuration as an innovative foundation concept for offshore wind turbines suited for water depths greater than 30 meters. The unique aspect of the GICON TLP is its modular, frame-work structure which allows buoyancy and load transfer functions to be decoupled from each other and instead be applied to the specific structural elements. In contrast to classic TLP designs and semi-submersible floaters, additional stabilizing effect achieved by this additional bracing minimizes the movement of the entire system. Due to this stable behavior of the TLP standard offshore turbines as currently available in the market should be usable for this platform. Furthermore results from model basin tests will be described. Also the comparison of calculated and experimental data obtained by extensive tank experiments with a scale model of an offshore turbine at Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (MARIN) in summer 2013 will be presented. These experiments include wind and wave loads that represent different sea states of the proposed location for the full scale prototype. In numerical simulations the dynamic behavior of the TLP under linked hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loading is taken into account also regarding different geometric configurations of the mooring line system and various types of anchorage systems at the sea floor. Using characteristic Campbell-diagrams structural stiffness of each component is optimized aiming at a soft-stiff design of the TLP-structure. The results of the scaled tests at MARIN have confirmed that a superposition of internal forces of the moored structure in operation for wind and wave loads can be assumed. Numerical modeling validation is confirmed by tank tests. Data and video from the tank tests will be shared as part of the presentation. GICON researchers plan to install a full- scale pilot plant in the German Baltic Sea in 2015. Copyright Â© (2015) by the Offshore Technology Conference All rights reserved.

TI  - Renewable energy production issues with the Cape Cod offshore wind energy programme
AB  - This paper evaluates the first offshore wind farm proposal in the USA. It is being put forward by Cape Wind Associates, a Boston-based firm that wishes to build 170 turbines five miles offshore in Nantucket Sound. The proposed development would supply up to 95% Cape Cod's energy needs and 2% of the energy requirements for the eastern New England region, preventing the need for additional fossil fuel power plants that would pollute the environment and harm the health of New Englanders. The eco-friendly state of Massachusetts has produced much opposition to this project. Criticism of this project ranges from anticipated bird kills by the turbines to concerns about the criteria and considerations that will be used in the permit process. However, the most important issue appears to be that of visual pollution to the residents of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. This paper examines this unique form of pollution and how reactionary not-in-my-backyard concerns can shape the debate. Copyright Â© 2006 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

TI  - Reactivity of CO2 with Utica, Marcellus, Barnett, and Eagle Ford Shales and Impact on Permeability
AB  - In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while recovering hydrocarbons from unconventional shale formations, processes that make use of carbon dioxide to enhance oil recovery while storing carbon dioxide (CO2) should be considered. Here, we examine samples from three shale basins across the United States (Utica and Marcellus Shales in the Appalachian Basin, Barnett Shale in the Bend Arch-Ft. Worth Basin, and Eagle Ford in the Western Gulf Basin) to address the following questions: (1) do changes from reaction with CO2 and fluids at the micrometer and nanometer scale alter flow pathways and, in turn, impact hydrocarbon production, CO2 storage, and seal integrity and (2) can CO2 or fluid reactivity be predicted based on physical or chemical properties of shale formations? Experiments were conducted at 40 degrees C and 10.3 MPa to characterize the interaction between CO2 and shale using X-ray diffraction (XRD), carbon and sulfur analysis, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), feature relocation scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), mercury (Hg) intrusion porosimetry, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and pore size analysis coupled with density functional theory (DFT) methods. Changes in mechanical, physical, and flow properties of shale cores due to CO2 exposure were addressed using a New England Research Autolab 1500 and Xenon X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning. Results showed that CO2 did not promote significant reactivity with the shale if water was not present; only shales with swelling clays or residual interstitial pore water reacted with dry CO2 to promote reactivity in shale. When water was added as a reactant, CO2 formed carbonic acid and reacted with the shale to dissolve carbonate pockets, etched and pitted the shale matrix surfaces, and increased the microporosity and decreased nanoporosity. Porosity and permeability increased appreciably in core shale samples after exposure to CO2 saturated fluid due to dissolution of carbonate. Shale mechanical properties were not altered. Trends were not observed that could tie CO2 or fluid reactivity to physical or chemical properties of the shale formations at the basin scale from the samples we examined. However, if the shale contained significant amounts of carbonate and water was available to react with the CO2, pore sizes were altered in the matrix and permeability and porosity increased.

TI  - Performance characterization of Bi-directional turbines for use in thermoacoustic generator applications
AB  - Bi-directional turbines convert oscillating axial fluid flow into uniform radial rotation and have proven effective in wave energy harvesting applications, like ocean wave generators. Two of the most widely studied designs for these scenarios are the Wells and axial turbines. This study characterizes the effectiveness of these turbines for use with a thermoacoustic generator; which is a relatively new technology that uses an induced temperature gradient to propagate acoustic waves within an enclosed, looped chamber. These generators are widely applied to refrigeration cycle systems; yet when paired with a bi-directional turbine, the resulting sound wave can be harnessed to generate electricity. This paper begins with a discussion of the thermoacoustic application covering relevant issues for the turbine. Next, the Wells, axial, and a combined hybrid turbine are presented in thorough detail including governing design features that were explored. Fabrication of a test fixture and turbine prototypes and experimental results from a broad ranging study of the performance of the turbine designs is shown. Finally, conclusions from the obtained results are discussed. Â© Copyright 2016 by ASME.

TI  - Demonstration of biofouling mitigation methods for long-term deployments of optical cameras
AB  - Biofouling mitigation measures for optical ports can extend the duration of oceanographic deployments, but there have been few quantitative studies offield performance. Results are presented from a 4-monthfield test of a stereo-optical camera system intended for long-term environmental monitoring of tidal turbines. A combination of passive (copper rings and ClearSignal antifouling coating) and active (mechanical wipers) biofouling mitigation measures are implemented on the optical ports of the two cameras and four strobe illuminators. Biofouling on the optical ports is monitored qualitatively by periodic diver inspections and quantitatively by metrics describing the quality of the images captured by cameras with different antifouling treatments. During deployment, barnacles colonized almost every surface of the camera system, except the optical ports with fouling mitigation measures. The effectiveness of the biofouling mitigation measures suggests that 4-month deployment durations are possible, even during conditions that would otherwise lead to severe fouling and occlusion of optical ports.

TI  - Study on Key Technical Schemes for Grid-connected Performance Testing of Offshore Wind Turbines
AB  - Offshore has the characteristics of not occupying land, rich in wind power resources, and has the advantages of high utilization hours of power generation and suitable for large-scale development. It has become the key direction of global wind power development. It can be predicted that offshore wind energy will become a very important part of the global energy internet in the future. After 20 years of wind power operation experience and the wind power technology improvement, the business and operation environment of offshore wind power development is becoming more and more mature. As the wind turbines installation site extends from land to offshore and deep-sea areas, "large" wind turbines have become the trend of offshore wind turbines development in the future. With the large-capacity offshore wind turbine prototype of many wind turbine manufacturers in China coming off the production line and successfully put into operation in China's coastal areas, offshore wind turbines above 6MW began to be put into commercial operation. Therefore, it is urgent to carry out relevant tests and inspections to improve the operation and grid connection performance of the unit. It is of great significance to master the operation characteristics and control methods of offshore wind turbine, qualitatively and quantitatively analyze its impact on power grid, study offshore wind power detection methods and develop relevant detection devices. Due to the differences of offshore environment, operation control and the particularity of offshore power transmission and collection mode, the onshore wind power test and detection ability can not adapt to the new changes and requirements of offshore wind energy test and detection.

TI  - Behavior of laterally loaded offshore wind monopiles in sands
AB  - The conventional design methods for laterally loaded offshore foundations in sand, API RP 2GEO (2014) and DNV (2018), were not developed for wind turbine monopiles that experience lateral loads imposing relatively small lateral displacements in service. This paper presents the results of research to evaluate the suitability of existing guidance for the design of laterally loaded monopiles at small displacements and to provide recommendations for improving design methods for monopile foundations. The research included applying existing techniques to measure the non-linear stiffness of sand at small shear strains, utilizing a three-dimensional finite element method (3-D FEM) model that incorporates the non-linear stiffness of sand to predict the lateral response of a monopile, testing the proposed approach with foundation model tests in the laboratory, and applying the proposed approach to the lateral load tests conducted on Mustang Island in 1966 that provided the original basis for current design methods. The following major conclusions are drawn from this research: 1. Model tests and field tests consistently show that the conventional p-y curves from current design practice tend to underestimate the initial stiffness for laterally loaded piles and fail to capture the non-linearity of the stiffness at small lateral displacements. 2. A 3-D FEM model that incorporates a constitutive model to characterize the small-strain properties of sand, including the maximum shear stiffness at very small strains and the relationships between shear stiffness and both shear strain and effective confining stress, is capable of predicting the response of laterally loaded piles both at model and field scales. These conclusions lead to the following recommendations for the design of laterally loaded monopiles in sand: 1. Exercise caution in using conventional p-y curves for sand to predict the performance of offshore wind turbine monopiles in service. The conventional p-y curves used in current design practice do not adequately predict the stiffness and non-linearity of laterally loaded piles at the small lateral displacements relevant for offshore wind turbine monopiles in service. 2. Measure directly or empirically establish the in-situ maximum ("small-strain") shear modulus, the relationship between shear modulus and shear strain, and the relationship between shear modulus and effective confining pressure. These small-strain properties are needed to predict the stiffness and non-linearity of laterally loaded piles at small lateral displacements. 3. Establish improved p-y curves to be used in design directly from 3-D FEM analyses using representative properties of the sand in-situ at small strains. Â© 2019, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - Environmental loads, motions, and mooring systems
AB  - As floating solar generating stations become larger and are located in more open bodies of water subject to extreme weather conditions, designing for survival becomes ever more challenging. This chapter commences with an overview of the physical properties of gravity water waves as found in oceans, seas, lakes, and reservoirs which result from wind blowing over the water surface. The next section on wave generation provides an appreciation of the height of waves which the floating solar array has to withstand as a function of wind speed, fetch distance, and duration. Wave spectra are introduced as a standard method of describing the characteristics of waves along with the fact that waves can travel very large distances in oceans arriving at a given location from different directions. Wave characteristics are modified as they travel from deep to shallow water through the process of shoaling and alter direction due to refraction. The net movement of water due to currents modifies the steepness of the waves either increasing or decreasing it depending on the relative direction of travel. The largest waves can be predicted using extreme value analysis for different return periods. A knowledge of the wave characteristics and the hydrodynamic response of the floating system enables an estimation of the loads on the structure. Wave loads due to both diffraction and drag are characterized. As well as the global loads on the structure localized very short duration high-impact loads can occur particularly on large flat surfaces due to wave slam. Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Studies of activated carbon electrodes for capacitive seawater desalination
AB  - Capacitive seawater desalination using non-grid-connected wind power provides an effective alternative to scarce water resources. Capacitive desalination uses a DC power supply and electrostatic charge of electrochemical double layer for ion removal is a promising technology for desalting applications. The influencing factors of the desalination technique (such as voltages, flow velocity and concentration of electrolytes) and the properties of activated carbon electrodes for capacitive desalination were studied by the potentiostatic charge/discharge technique and comparing the equipotential adsorption isotherms of activated carbon electrodes to alkali and alkaline earth metal chlorides. It was found that the properties of activated carbon electrodes for ion removal were determined by the operating voltage and flow velocity of the solution. Appropriately higher voltage resulted greater degree of adsorption. Adsorption amount of activated carbons to alkali and alkaline earth metal chlorides correlated with interaction between the ions and solvent. The Adsorption amount to alkali and alkaline earth metal chlorides ranged in the list of K+ â‰¥ Na+ â‰¥ Li+ â‰¥ Ca 2+ ge; Mg2+ and it seemed that ion adsorption on the surface of activated carbon is correlative with their hydrated ionic radius.

TI  - Improved oil recovery using CO2 as an injection medium: a detailed analysis
AB  - The main goal of any improved oil recovery (IOR) is to displace the remaining oil in a reservoir; it is achieved by improving the volumetric efficiency and enhancing the oil displacement. Carbon dioxide is considered to have high potential to improve the production efficiency of the reservoir. This processÂ is gaining a lot of relevance these days as one of the best IOR techniques because when CO2 dissolves in heavy oil, it reduces the oil viscosity, increases the oil swelling, improves the gravity segregation of oil and the internal drive energy. Consequently, this improves the oil recovery from the reservoir. Oil recovery using CO2 is a win/win technique because it enhances the oil recovery and can be used as a CO2 storage option in reservoirs to reduce the greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere. In the present study, the reservoir simulation is used to predict the reservoirâ€™s behavior using different production scenarios. A reservoir model is constructed using Eclipse and is used to optimize the well. The objective of this study is to enhance understanding of improved oil recovery for a typical reservoir located offshore on Australian continental shelf. The second part of this study focuses on carrying out an economic analysis of the best IOR scenario, with the maximum oil recovery, by analyzing key variables, such as oil prices, capital costs, operation and maintenance costs, CO2 prices and taxes. The results obtained indicated that proper well optimization performed in high oil saturation areas using sensitivity analysis and optimizing the values of injection and production increases the oil recovery and maximum sweep of the reservoir. The economic analysis carried out on the chosen optimum scenario 4 was found to be very economical with total savings of $173Â M. Â© 2014, The Author(s).

TI  - Prediction of power generation by offshore wind farms using multiple data sources
AB  - In this study we evaluated the wind resources of wind farms in the Changhua offshore area of Taiwan. The offshore wind farm in Zone of Potential (ZoP) 26 was optimized through an economic evaluation. The annual energy production (AEP) of the offshore wind farm in ZoP 26 was predicted for 10 and 25 years with probabilities of 50%, 75%, and 90% by using measured mast data, measure-correlate-predict (MCP) data derived from Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), and Central Weather Bureau (CWB) data. When the distance between the turbines in a wind farm was decreased from 12D to 6D, the turbine number increased from 53 to 132, while the capacity factor decreased slightly from 48.6% to 47.6%. MCP data derived from the inland CWB station with similar levels of wind resources can be used to accurately predict the power generation of the target offshore wind farm. The use of MCP with mast data as target data, together with CWB and MERRA data as reference data, proved to be a feasible method for predicting offshore wind power generation in places where a mast is available in a neighboring area.

AB  - In this paper, results from comparisons of simulations and measured offshore data from a floating combined wind and wave energy conversion system are presented. The numerical model of the platform is based on the aeroelastic code, HAWC2, developed by DTU Wind Energy, which is coupled with a special external system that reads the output generated directly by the wave analysis software WAMIT. The main focus of the comparison is on the statistical trends of the platform motion, mooring loads, and turbine loads in measurements and simulations during different operational conditions. Finally, challenges and possible approaches for further model development and validation are discussed. Â© 2015. The International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers.

TI  - Effect of pile-soil interaction on structural dynamics of large moment magnitude-scale offshore wind turbines in shallow-water Western Gulf of Mexico
AB  - The effect of pile-soil interaction on structural dynamics is investigated for a large offshore wind turbine (OWT) in the hurricane-prone Western Gulf of Mexico (GOM) shallow water. The OWT has a rotor with three 100-meter blades and a monotower structure. Loads on the turbine rotor and the support structure subject to a 100-year return hurricane are determined. Several types of soil are considered and modeled with a distributed spring system. The results reveal that pile-soil interaction affects dynamics of the turbine support structure significantly, but not the rotor dynamics. Designed with proper pile lengths, natural frequencies of the turbine structure in different soils stay outside dominant frequencies of wave energy spectra in both normal operating and hurricane sea states, but stay between blade passing frequency intervals. Hence, potential resonance of the turbine support structure is not of concern. A comprehensive Campbell diagram is constructed for safe operation of the offshore turbine in different soils.

TI  - Algal bioethanol production technology: A trend towards sustainable development
AB  - Fuel security, economics and climate change issues are creating a requirement for alternative renewable fuels. Bioethanol produced by algal biomass is becoming increasingly popular all over the world due to the sustainability of feed stock and environmentally friendly nature. This review paper describes the bioethanol production technology from algae using various cultivation, harvesting, extraction and commercialization techniques and its environmental perspectives. The economic sustainability of algae-derived bioethanol biofuel depends on the cost of production that could be minimized by producing valuable secondary by-products, which is the aim of current algal biofuel research. Future technologies with sufficient potential for maximum extraction capacity and minimal downstream processing using low cost feedstock will address the cost-effectiveness of renewable bioethanol biofuel.

TI  - Hybrid-Electric Propulsion for Aircraft
AB  - Against a background of increasing energy demand and rising fuel prices, hybrid-electric propulsion systems have the potential to significantly reduce fuel consumption in the aviation industry, particularly in the lighter sectors. By taking advantage of both electric motor and internal combustion engine, hybrid-electric propulsion systems provide not only a benefit in fuel saving but also a reduction in takeoff noise and the emission levels. This research considers the design and sizing process of a hybrid-electric propulsion system for a single-seat demonstrator aircraft, the experimental derivation of the internal combustion engine map, and the electric motor parameters. In addition to the experimental data, a novel modeling approach including several linked desktop PC software packages is presented to analyze and optimize hybrid-electric technology for aircraft. Further to the analysis of a parallel hybrid-electric, midscale aircraft, this paper also presents a scaling approach for a 20kg unmanned aerial vehicle and a 50ton intercity airliner. At the smaller scale, two different mission profiles are analyzed: an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance mission profile and a maximum-duration profile. At the larger scale, the performance of a 50ton intercity airliner is modeled, based on a hybrid-electric gas turbine, assuming a range of electric boost powers and battery masses.

TI  - Sustaining Undergraduate Sustainability Education
AB  - The importance of educating future generations of engineers with respect to sustainability is becoming increasingly obvious. At the U.S. Coast Guard Academy (CGA), the engineering faculty recognize the need to educate the future of our service and have developed a variety of classroom approaches to ensure students fully understand the role that climate change and sustainability play in their engineering decision making process. As a sea-going service, most of the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG)'s assets are along coastline. As the USCG's primary civil engineering accession point, ensuring future engineers are exposed to the potential challenges that may arise due to rising sea level, predicted water shortages and changes in the availability of energy resources is an issue of readiness. Concepts of sustainability have necessarily been infused into CGA's undergraduate engineering curriculum. The manner in which sustainability has been taught in several undergraduate courses within the civil engineering program at CGA is discussed. Teaching methods utilizing various pedagogies have been employed to ensure that graduates understand the complexity of the issues surrounding the ecological changes facing the planet while also providing a solid understanding of the practices of sustainability and the need for the education of future generations on the topic.

TI  - Energy for island communities - small wave energy systems based on the air diaphragm principle.
AB  - The general case is made for the consideration of wave energy as a possible useful and economic alternative source on power for island communities. Work in the UK to date has been concentrated on the large scale installations established at a site remote from the eventual user. It is this work that has been used to indicate the starting point for very different designs, both in scale and objective, but are required for the Island situation where the power is needed local to its point of conversion. The design presented is suitable for locations where the seabed is gently sloping and bedrock is at some depth below seabed and where modest power levels are required. Other configurations are possible to suit locations where great water depths occur close inshore and bedrock is exposed. The principles of the floating Lancaster Flexible Bag as designed for the UK Department of Energy Wave Energy Research and Development programme are adapted using the same air diaphragm principle applied to a bottom mounted inshore small scale installation.

TI  - Seawater flow characteristics and drag force variation with inflow angle in tidal current turbine system
AB  - Numerical analysis has been performed to investigate the seawater flow characteristics and drag force variation on tidal current turbine system with the direction of tidal current. Seawater velocity distribution is largely affected by the current direction flowing into the turbine system including shroud. Wake flow near the unshrouded turbine is generated and the wake region becomes wider in the tidal current direction. Drag force on the system also increases with the inflow angle. The vortex generated from the turbine system continuously moves outward from the shroud inside while the force increases before reaching a peak and then decrease. These results of the seawater flow characteristics with drag force variation according to tidal current direction can be applied to optimal design of tidal current power generation systems.

TI  - Exploration of Antifouling Potential of the Brown Algae Laminaria `Sanhai'
AB  - Seaweeds are one of the largest producers of biomass in the marine environment. It has been well known that marine algae, especially brown algae was a rich source of biogenic compounds with antifouling potential that could be ideal alternatives of tributyltin (TBT). In this paper, antifouling potential of the brown algae Laminaria `sanhai' was explored. Firstly, the dried alga was extracted and the antialgal and antilarval activities were investigated. The EC50 and LC50 values of crude extract of Laminaria `sanhai' against diatom (Skeletonema costatum) and barnacle larval (Chthamalus challengeri) were 8.9 mu g mL(-1) and 12.0 mu g mL(-1) respectively. Then, guided by bioassay, the bioactive substances were isolated by liquid-liquid extraction. The antialgal and antilarval activities of isolated fraction were improved with the EC50 value of 7.4 mu g mL(-1) against S. costatum and LC(50 )value of 9.7 mu g mL(-1) against C. challengeri larvae. Identification by IR, Q-TOFMS and GC-MS of the isolated bioactive substances revealed the abundance of fatty acids. These fatty acids, most with 16, 18 or 20 carbon atoms, contained myristic, hexadecanoic, oleic, linolenic, arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids. The results indicated that both the crude extract and the isolated bioactive substances had high antialgal and antilarval activities with no highlighted cytotoxicity which made the brown algae Laminaria `sanhai' a promising source of the environmentally friendly antifoulants.

TI  - Sustainable Seaweed Biotechnology Solutions for Carbon Capture, Composition, and Deconstruction
AB  - Seaweeds or macroalgae are attractive candidates for carbon capture, while also supplying a sustainable photosynthetic bioenergy feedstock, thanks to their cultivation potential in offshore marine farms. Seaweed cultivation requires minimal external nutrient requirements and allows for year-round production of biomass. Despite this potential, there remain significant challenges associated with realizing large-scale, sustainable agronomics, as well as in the development of an efficient biomass deconstruction and conversion platform to fuels and products. Recent biotechnology progress in the identification of enzymatic deconstruction pathways, tailored to complex polymers in seaweeds, opens up opportunities for more complete utilization of seaweed biomass components. Effective, scalable, and economically viable conversion processes tailored to seaweed are discussed and gaps are identified for yield and efficiency improvements. Â© 2020 The Authors

TI  - A new HVDC-DC converter for the efficient connection of HVDC networks
AB  - Today, HVDC power transmission in Europe is mainly used to transmit offshore wind power to the shore or to transfer bulk power over seas. The voltage rating of each single HVDC connection depends on the used technology and mainly on the available cable ratings and differs from project to project. Onshore DC power is converted into AC and fed in to the AC grid. With the upcoming need to transfer bulk power over long onshore distances it would be more economic to maintain DC energy transportation. Hence, there is a need for economic interconnection of HVDC lines (Multi Terminal Network) with different voltage ratings for combined long distance power transmission. In this paper a new HVDC-DC converter, based on MMC technology, is presented, investigated and compared to the commonly known use of full scale HVDC voltage source converters (VSC) for the direct interconnection of HVDC lines with different voltage ratings.

TI  - Seawall construction alters soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics and soil microbial biomass in an invasive Spartina alterniflora salt marsh in eastern China
AB  - Seawalls have increasingly been constructed to control the invasion of an exotic perennial grass, Spartina alterniflora, in coastal wetlands of eastern China. We investigated soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), available and microbial C and N, soil microbial community composition and biomass in a seawall-reclaimed S. alterniflora salt marsh compared with an adjacent natural S. alterniflora salt marsh. Seawall reclamation in S. alterniflora salt marsh significantly decreased soil salinity, moisture, litter and root biomass, and strongly decreased soil total organic C by 57\% and total organic N by 59\%, and also lowered soil available C and N in S. alterniflora salt marsh. Seawall reclamation significantly decreased soil microbial biomass C and the quantities of the total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), and bacterial, fungal, gram-negative bacterial, gram-positive bacterial, saturated straight-chain, and monounsaturated PLFAs in deeper soil layers (10-30 cm). Our results suggested that seawall construction could greatly decrease soil C and N accumulation of S. alterniflora salt marsh by decreasing S. alterniflora residuals input into the soil and lowering soil salinity and moisture, which further decreased soil microbial biomass by lowering soil available C and N in S. alterniflora salt marsh. Changes in soil microbial community composition and biomass could in turn affect soil C and N accumulation in a seawall-reclaimed S. alterniflora salt marsh in eastern China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - LAKE LEVEL REGULATION AND SHORELINE EROSION ON FLATHEAD LAKE, MONTANA - A RESPONSE TO THE REDISTRIBUTION OF ANNUAL WAVE ENERGY
AB  - Concern regarding increased coastal erosion has heightened amid growing acceptance of global warming and associated sea-level rise. Attention has focused on the absolute elevation of sea-level rise, whereas shoreline erosion may result more from the redistribution of wave energy over the duration of the sea-level rise. This study examines shoreline erosion in Flathead Lake, Montana, resulting from a redistribution of annual wave energy due to five decades of regulated lake levels by a dam at the lake's outlet. The annual rise in lake level is held for an extended duration at a regulated `'full pool'' level which is approximately 3 m above its natural base elevation. The total time for a complete cycle of lake level change also has been increased from 100 days to over 300 days.         Alteration of the natural lake level fluctuation has resulted in a transfer of annual wave energy from base elevations corresponding to the pre-dam nearshore shelf, to elevations corresponding to the limnetic foreshore environment, thereby inducing lake-wide erosion. The most extensive erosion has occurred along the low-lying dissipative north shore of the lake. The redistribution of annual wave energy due to regulated lake level fluctuation is the main factor contributing to that erosion. The redistribution of annual incident wave energy is examined in terms of an increase in the duration of the complete natural lake-level cycle, a reduced range in lake level fluctuation, and an elevated full pool lake level. Both the duration of lake level cycle and range in water level fluctuation affect the distribution of incident wave energy and were found to be more important to shoreline erosion than an absolute elevated water level. An alternative regulation scheme incorporating concerns for both hydropower production and lake recreation is proposed and examined in terms of reducing erosion. Altering the regulated lake level fluctuation by changing the timing and increasing the rate of lake level drawdown, would result in a significant reduction in the amount of annual wave energy that reaches the eroding full pool shoreline, thereby reducing the potential for take-wide shoreline erosion.

TI  - Energy assessments of onboard CO2 capture from ship engines by MEA-based post combustion capture system with flue gas heat integration
AB  - An early phase feasibility study was carried out for offshore CO2 capture from ship engines of a CO2 transport ship. A flexible in-house process simulator was applied in the assessments. Parametric studies of the overall onboard process were enabled by a fast data-driven capture plant model derived from supervised machine learning by PLS regression of a large dataset of rigorous simulations. The results show, based on the given models and assumptions, that the thermal energy coming from the ship engine exhaust gas is not sufficient alone to cover the thermal energy demand of an absorption-based CO2 capture unit operating above 50% capture rate using 30 wt% MEA (mono-ethanolamine) as solvent. The thermal energy demand can be met using a fuel afterburner as heat source. The added fuel consumption is estimated to increase the fuel consumption by 6â€“9% when operating with liquefied natural gas (LNG) as fuel source, while an increase of 8â€“12% is expected with diesel as fuel source. The effect of absorber height on energy consumption at a given CO2 capture rate is limited, especially for lower capture rates, and may be an important degree of freedom for optimizing the CAPEX/OPEX trade-offs. Use of state-of-the art solvents with lower specific energy consumptions will shift the results towards higher capture rates before a fuel afterburner is required to meet the thermal energy demands.

TI  - PRELIMINARY RESULTS ON BLUE CARBON CONTENT MAPPING IN COASTAL WATERS OF THE ARABIAN GULF USING SATELLITE-BASED MODELING APPROACH
AB  - Seagrass beds play an important role in carbon storage, as well as an effective removal of CO2 from the ``biosphere-atmosphere{''} system, which plays a significant role in the amelioration of climate change impacts. The present study focused on carbon content modeling and mapping in submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) including seagrass and algae species in coastal water areas (-0.5 to -7 m depth) of the Arabian Gulf using field sampling, laboratory analyses and satellite-based approach. The used Landsat-OLI image, acquired simultaneously with field sampling, was preprocessed rigorously to remove all radiometric and geometric anomalies. The modeling is applied on 55 samples collected from the seabed including biomass of the canopy (above-ground biomass: AGB), roots and rhizomes (below-ground biomass: BGB) and sediments (within a depth 15 cm). Each sampling location was automatically labeled and recorded using a ``Deep-Blue-Pro{''} underwater digital camera equipped with a sub-meter GPS survey and connected to a laptop computer allowing a real time viewing of seabed. The carbon content was analyzed in the laboratory considering separately the AGB, BGB, and sediments in each sample, and then converted and calculated at the OLI pixel size level. A linear regression at 95\% confidence interval was applied between the obtained carbon content at the pixel level and: a) calibrated reflectances in the VNIR spectral bands, b) water spectral indices, and c) percentage of SAV cover (PSAVC) fraction determined by a semi-empirical relation developed previously. The results revealed that the best fit (R-2 = 0.87) was obtained between PSAVC and the total carbon content derived from the biomass (AGB and BGB) and sediments. The cross-validation of derived carbon map based on the proposed modeling approach showed a good correlation (R-2 = 0.74) and an acceptable RMSE of +/- 0.4 kg/m(2). However, despite the limited number of sampling points, the uncertainly of carbon content scaling up at the pixel level, and the errors propagation in modeling process, these preliminary results are encouraging for carbon content modeling and mapping over a large area in shallow water based on optical remote sensing.

TI  - Diatom resting spore ecology drives enhanced carbon export from a naturally iron-fertilized bloom in the Southern Ocean
AB  - Southern Ocean Island systems sustain phytoplankton blooms induced by natural iron fertilization that are important for the uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide and serve as analogues for past and future climate change. We present data on diatom flux assemblages and the biogeochemical properties of sinking particles to explain the enhanced particulate organic carbon (POC) export fluxes observed in response to natural iron supply in the Crozet Islands region (CROZeX). Moored deep-ocean sediment traps (>2000 m) were located beneath a naturally fertilized island bloom and beneath an adjacent High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll (HNLC) control site. Deep-ocean carbon flux from the naturally-fertilized bloom area was tightly correlated (R = 0.83, n = 12, P < 0.0006) with the resting spore flux of a single island-associated diatom species, Eucampia antarctica var. antarctica. The unusually well preserved state of the Eucampia-associated carbon flux, determined by amino acid studies of organic matter degradation, was likely influenced by their ecology, since diatom resting spores are adapted to settle rapidly out of the surface ocean preserving viable cells. The naturally fertilized bloom enhanced carbon flux and the resulting Si/C and Si/N ratios were 2.0-3.4-fold and 2.2-3.5-fold lower than those measured in the adjacent HNLC control area. The enhanced carbon export and distinctive stoichiometry observed in naturally fertilized systems is therefore largely not attributable to iron relief of open ocean diatoms, but rather to the advection and growth of diatom species characteristic of island systems and the subsequent flux of resting spores. Carbon export estimates from current natural iron fertilization studies therefore represent a highly specific response of the island systems chosen as natural laboratories and may not be appropriate analogues for the larger Southern Ocean response. The broader implications of our results emphasize the role of phytoplankton diversity and ecology and highlight the need for a species-centered approach in order to understand the regulation of biogeochemical fluxes.

TI  - Mooring Design Selection of Aquaculture Cage for Indonesian Ocean
AB  - Fish production is important for the economy in fishing community and for ensuring food security. Climate change will lead a threat to fish productivity. Therefore, a solution offered is to cultivate certain fish, especially those with high economic value by using offshore aquaculture technology. A Sea Station cage is one of the offshore aquaculture cage model that has been used in some locations. As a floating structure, the Sea Station cage need a mooring system to maintain its position. This paper presents the selection analysis of the mooring system designs of the Sea Station cage model that it is suitable with Indonesia Ocean. There are 3 mooring configurations that are linear array, rectangular array, and 4 points mooring type. The nylon mooring rope type has been selected to be used on the 3 mooring configurations and the rope has a diameter of 104 mm with a breaking force of 2.3 MN. Based on results from comparing the 3 mooring configurations, the best mooring configuration is linear array with the tension on the rope of 217 KN and has the safety factor of 0.2 based on DNVGL OS-E301

TI  - The role of local knowledge in the governance of blue carbon
AB  - There are more than 1500 partnerships and initiatives currently addressing Sustainable Development Goal \#14 (Life Below Water), with blue carbon activities - carbon-oriented conservation and restoration projects in coastal ecosystems - representing a small proportion. A key challenge for blue carbon initiatives is the integration of social and cultural dimensions within governance mechanisms - a common problem in global environmental governance. An important question is how these mechanisms integrate local knowledge, traditional customs, and rights, especially in the climate-vulnerable contexts of island states in the Indo-Pacific region. This study describes global blue carbon governance - considering market-based instruments, public investment, partnership initiatives, and community-centred management schemes - and evaluates the extent to which these different approaches facilitate or constrain the integration and agency of local knowledge. This research offers valuable insights on the applicability of blue carbon governance mechanisms in small island states (SIS) in the Indo-Pacific region, and their potential to contribute to sustainability outcomes including social-ecological health and environmental justice.

TI  - Extracting energy from tidal currents: The ocean response at multiple space and time scales
AB  - Tidal stream energy is a reliable and predictable low-carbon energy source. Over the next few years the first arrays of multiple tidal stream turbines will be deployed mostly in UK, French and Canadian waters. The potential environmental effects should first be examined, in order to scale and site them appropriately. Large theoretical arrays of tidal stream turbines were designed for Scottish Waters (UK), to quantify the available power and the ocean response to its extraction. A comprehensive assessment of the tidal energy resource realistically available for electricity generation and the study of the potential environmental impacts associated with its extraction in Scottish Waters, can then lead the way to further development in different countries with potential tidal stream energy sources. In order to examine both local (<100 km) and region-wide (>100 km) spatial scales, the Scottish Shelf Model, an unstructured grid three-dimensional FVCOM (Finite Volume Community Ocean Model) implementation, is a useful tool, since it covers the entire NW European Shelf, but with a high resolution where the tidal stream energy is extracted. The arrays of tidal stream turbines were implemented in the model using the momentum sink approach, in which a momentum sink term represents the loss of momentum due to tidal energy extraction. A typical annual cycle of the NW European Shelf hydrodynamics was reproduced by the SSM model and compared with the same period perturbed by tidal stream energy extraction. The power extracted by the tidal stream arrays was estimated, taking into account the tidal stream energy extraction feedbacks on the flow and considering the realistic operation of a generic tidal stream turbine, which is limited to operate in a range of flow velocities due to technological constraints. The ocean response to tidal stream power extraction was then analysed at the temporal scale of a spring-neap tidal cycle and, for the first time, on longer term seasonal timescales. It is shown that the very large tidal stream arrays can introduce detectable changes to the tidal elevation, marine currents and ocean stratification patterns. Tidal elevation mainly increases upstream of the tidal farms locations (considering the direction of propagation of the tidal wave), while a decrease in the mean spring tidal range is observed downstream, along the UK East Coast and also in the Irish Sea. Marine currents, both tidal and residual flows, are also affected. They can slow down due to the turbines' action or speed up due to flow diversion and blockage processes, on both a local and regional scale. The strongest signal in tidal velocities is an overall reduction, which can in turn decrease the energy of tidal mixing and perturb the seasonal stratification on the NW European Shelf. Although the strength of summer stratification has been found to slightly increase, the extent of the stratified region does not greatly change, thus suggesting the enhanced biological and pelagic biodiversity hotspots, e.g. tidal mixing front locations, are not displaced. Such large-scale tidal stream energy extraction is unlikely to occur in the near future, since very large numbers of devices are required, but such potential changes should be considered when planning future tidal energy exploitation. It is likely that large scale developments around the NW European shelf will interact and could, for example, intensify or weaken the changes predicted here, or even be used as mitigation measures (e.g. coastal defence) for other changes, e.g. effects of climate change.

TI  - Assessing extreme environmental loads on offshore structures in the north sea from high-resolution ocean currents, waves and wind forecasting
AB  - The fast development of the offshore energy industry becomes an essential component of resilient economies in most of the countries around the North Sea, addressing an increasing demand for cost-efficient and environmentally safe energy sources. Offshore wind farms are planned to be installed further away from the coasts to ensure stronger and more stable wind resources in this region. Oil and gas extraction infrastructures are also planned to move into deeper areas of the continental shelf and continental shelf slopes to explore new fields. These deeper areas of the ocean are characterised by harsh environmental conditions: stronger winds, larger waves and strong shelf slope currents, inducing considerably larger loads on offshore structures. This study brings together operational physical oceanography and the mathematics of fluid-structure interactions to estimate the likelihood of extreme environmental loads on offshore structures in the North Sea. We use the state-of-the-art Met Office high resolution ocean forecasting system, which provides high-frequency data on ocean and tidal currents, wave heights and periods and winds at a ~7 km horizontal resolution grid, spanning the Northâ€“West European Shelf. The Morison equation framework is used to calculate environmental loads on various types of offshore structures that are typically employed by the offshore industries in the North Sea. We use hourly data for a 2-year period to analyse the spatio-temporal variability of mean and extreme hydrodynamic loads and derive the relative con-tributions of currents, waves and winds in the region. The results indicate that waves dominate extreme hydrodynamic forces on the shallow shelf, whereas the current contribution is important at the shelf break and in the English Channel.

TI  - Potential effect of CO2 seepage at high pressure on the marine organic matter
AB  - Seepage from a carbon capture and storage site (CCS) under the seabed can lead to CO2 enrichment of the surrounding seawater. This seepage may cause changes that alter the composition of the marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool. This study evaluated possible changes in the composition of the DOM in the event of CO2 seepage in sediments from a CCS site in the Baltic Sea. High-pressure (9 atm) and low pH (pH 7) conditions were simulated using a hyperbaric titanium tank over a period of 40 days. The DOM composition was analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to a high-resolution mass spectrometer (LC-HRMS) with electrospray (ESI) as ionization mode in both positive and negative polarities. An effect of the pH7 conditions on the DOM compounds was detected in both ionization modes. In this study, it was possible to determine whether the changes observed on the DOM were caused by natural seawater variation or by the effect of pH 7. Results showed that the composition of organic compounds can be impacted in seepage areas where a pH 7 occurs.

However, with the current economic outlook uncertain, it is essential that companies, more than ever before, strive to meet cost and time budgets as accurately as possible. This paper will explain how the use of current technologies with a single design environment for all major components can be utilised to maximise construction efficiency. The use of a single design environment reduces potential interface errors and therefore subsequent rework allowing shorter construction times and therefore greater cost efficiency, crucial in the current economic climate.

TI  - Spatial variability of ocean waves, from in-situ measurements
AB  - This paper describes the analysis of the spatial properties of ocean waves using measurements from an array of four directional wave buoys installed in a square formation, with side 500 m, in the Celtic Sea, UK. Wave measurements in this area have been installed to support resource assessment and design for wave energy devices at the Wave Hub site off the North Cornwall coast. This unique deployment of multiple directional sensors provides high quality direct measurements of the spatial properties of the wave field. Spectral parameters measured simultaneously by all four buoys within the array are compared and it is demonstrated that wave conditions cannot be considered stationary across the measurement area. Differences in the measured wave fields were observed primarily in the low frequencies and are observed to be of a level sufficient to impact the assessment of site characteristics. Theoretical estimations of refraction and bottom friction indicate that these physical processes contribute to the observed measurements. The results demonstrate the potential effect of spatial variability in wave fields on the monitoring of wave energy sites, and highlight the requirement for accurate evaluation of physical processes.

TI  - Early Project LDHI dosage assumptions versus an extensive laboratory study
AB  - Early phases of development for projects with hydrate mitigation strategies incorporating low dose hydrate inhibitors (LDHIs) are often subjected to assumptions in LDHI dosing requirements, which impact both CAPEX (tanks, pumps, umbilicals) and OPEX (chemical spend). These assumptions can influence the viability of projects moving forward, especially in low-cost environments, and has reemphasized the need for a critical evaluation of the state of the industry for LDHI performance under a variety of conditions. Within this paper, a series of tests examining the impact of produced water salinity and water cut on LDHI effectiveness using a range of hydrocarbon fluids was carried out using high pressure rocking cells. Standard test conditions were utilized throughout the investigation in constant mass rocking cells with an initial pressure of 2,500 psi using synthetic Green Canyon gas. Salinity sensitivity studies maintained held water cuts constant at 40 vol% while varying the salinity from condensed water up to 250,000 TDS NaCl. Water cut sensitivity studies examined both, 35,000 TDS (seawater) and 125,000 TDS, brine conditions while the water cut was varied from 5% to 80%. Salinity sensitivities were repeated using two commercially available anti-agglomerates (AAs) as standards and three hydrocarbon phases, including two different black oils and kerosene. Water cut sensitivities were conducted with one commercially available AA and two hydrocarbon phases: a black oil and kerosene. The significance of these matrices demonstrates that project planning should include baseline testing with fluids representing actual expected field conditions to better assess AA requirements for new developments. In many cases, project assumptions about costs or chemical performance should be reexamined. Â© 2018, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Caisson foundations for competitive offshore wind farms in Italy
AB  - The research presented in the paper moves from the results of a feasibility study recently carried out for the development of an offshore wind farm off the cost of Rimini, in the Northern Adriatic Sea. The work, based on in-situ measurements of the environmental conditions, assessed the suitability of the considered area for the development of a relatively large wind farm, although at the profitability limit. The study has considered 60 offshore wind turbines installed on monopiles, as they are, at present, the most common solution and a quantification of the investment costs could be reliably completed. With reference to such case, the paper addresses the use of caisson foundations, a convenient alternative to monopiles in water of shallow to intermediate depth, with the final aim of improving the overall cost-effectiveness of the investment.

TI  - Offshore wind speed estimates from a high-resolution rapidly updating numerical weather prediction model forecast dataset
AB  - In association with the Department of Energyâ€“funded Position of Offshore Wind Energy Resources (POWER) project, we present results from compositing a 3-year dataset of 80-m (above ground level) wind forecasts from the 3-km High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model over offshore regions for the contiguous United States. The HRRR numerical weather prediction system runs once an hour and features hourly data assimilation, providing a key advantage over previous model-based offshore wind datasets. On the basis of 1-hour forecasts from the HRRR model, we highlight the different climatological regimes of the nearshore environment, characterizing the mean 80-m wind speed as well as the frequency of exceeding 4, 12, and 25Â mÂ sâˆ’1 for east and west coast, Gulf of Mexico, and Great Lake locations. Preliminary verification against buoy measurements demonstrates good agreement with observations. This dataset can inform the placement of targeted measurement systems in support of improving resource assessments and wind forecasts to advance offshore wind energy goals both in New England and other coastal regions of the United States.

TI  - Parametric modelling of multi-body cylindrical offshore wind turbine platforms
AB  - This work explains a mathematical model to facilitate the parametric preparation of cylindrical multi-body panel geometries of offshore wind turbines. The input data in matrix-form, translated into a panel mesh that is used to represent a number of offshore wind turbine platforms currently being evaluated. The suggested approach goes through modelling without considering the connecting braces of multi-body geometries. The mathematical model is explained through the example of a cylinder. Then, buoy forms, spars and semi-submersibles are exemplified. To validate the method, the model of a TLP platform is used and the results obtained through the presented approach are compared to previously published results.

TI  - Three-dimensional woven geotextiles for containment dike construction
AB  - Every year, approximately 300 million m(3) (400 million yd(3)) of sediment is dredged from the United States' waterways (Fairweather, 1995). Although the primary purpose is to increase navigational capacities of channels, engineers are constantly seeking more effective and environmentally acceptable disposal methods for dredged materials. When the Port of Houston Authority faced this challenge, the Beneficial Uses Group (BUG) decided to utilize dredged material from the Houston Ship Channel to construct over 1720 hectares (4250 acres) of intertidal salt marshes. Starting in February 1994, three geosynthetic materials were installed along 1000 m (3300 ft) of dredged material containment levee at a demonstration marsh built on the east side of Atkinson Island. Proposed as possible cost-effective alternatives to conventional riprap, the three materials chosen included a cellular confinement system, fabricated geotextile tubes, and a three-dimensional woven geotextile for the shoreline protection. The three-dimensional woven geotextile was installed on 2H:1V slopes and secured using anchor trenches, hairpin-shaped reinforcing steel bar and duckbill anchors. To date, the product has helped to maintain a stable, nonerosive levee and promoted diversified aquatic vegetation (Anonymous, 1994). The project continues to be closely monitored by the Port of Houston Authority, the US Army Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Resources Conservation Services and a host of other agencies. This paper describes the background, selection, installation, and performance of the three-dimensional woven geotextile used for erosion protection along 122 m (400 ft) of levee on this demonstration project. Chronological data, field observations and photographs are included to compliment the observations and conclusions made by the authors, and others, from the time of installation to present.

TI  - Marine Protected Areas and Offshore Wind Farms
AB  - This chapter discusses the potential negative impacts that an offshore wind farms (OWFs) can have on marine biodiversity and the ways an OWF can increase species abundance, richness and biodiversity to establish whether OWF and Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can in fact ever co-exist. It also discusses the future prospects for OWF development that may reduce the initial impact, thereby enhancing their co-existence. The chapter considers examples where OWFs and MPAs exist in the same place as well as examples of where the existence of an MPA has prohibited or stalled the construction of an OWF. There are three main stages in the life of an OWF: construction, operation and decommissioning. The chapter discusses some of the known effects of OWF noise on marine mammals, such as temporary hearing loss and permanent tissue damage. Â© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Maritime environmental performance indicators for urban waterways in Amsterdam
AB  - Owing to new regulations starting from 2025, all commercial canal boats have to comply to zero local emission standards in Amsterdam. It is therefore vital that a clear emission indicator is made available for vessels with a varying operational profile, such as canal boats. In this paper, it is argued that current indicators, such as the Energy Efficiency Design Index, are not suitable for these (passenger) vessels. This paper proposes environmental performance indicators that can quantify emissions, (non-dimensional) energy and fuel usage based on an operational profile set in the design phase. This profile includes part load operation and auxiliary consumers and it can compare new designed concepts with current baseline vessels based on the â€˜benefit for societyâ€™ of different vessel types. In the proposed environmental performance indicators, several operational modes can be defined, in contrast with the currently proposed Energy Efficiency Design Index, which is a point index at 75% of installed power. To gauge not only local emissions but also global emissions, the environmental performance indicator methodology is used to determine a minimum efficiency from any power generation method. This minimum efficiency follows from a comparison between baseline vessels and concepts that are more energy efficient and emission friendly. The proposed environmental performance indicators were validated using measurements on typical propulsion configurations of canal boats in Amsterdam. Three full electric concepts were designed and compared with the measured baseline vessels. As full electric concepts do not have local emissions, the method of power generation must satisfy the requirement to have less global emissions than the mechanical baseline. Furthermore, an energy efficiency of at least 33% is calculated from a fossil-fuelled land-based power plant (including transport) to the boundary from quay to boat to be required for newly designed electric concepts to be more energy efficient than the mechanical baseline.

TI  - Projected impact of deep ocean carbon dioxide discharge on atmospheric CO2 concentrations
AB  - An evaluation of oceanic containment strategies for anthropogenic carbon dioxide is presented. Energy conservation is also addressed through an input hydrocarbon-fuel consumption function. The effectiveness of the proposed countermeasures is determined from atmospheric CO2 concentration predictions. A previous box model with a diffusive deep ocean is adapted and applied to the concept of fractional CO2 injection in 500 m deep waters. Next, the contributions of oceanic calcium carbonate sediment dissolution, and of deep seawater renewal, are included. Numerical results show that for CO2 direct removal measures to be effective, large fractions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide have to be processed. This point favors fuel pre-processing concepts. The global model also indicates that energy conservation, i.e. a hydrocarbon-fuel consumption slowdown, remains the most effective way to mitigate the greenhouse effect, because it offers mankind a substantial time delay to implement new energy production alternatives.

TI  - Operational constraints and strategies for systems to effect the sustainable, solar-driven reduction of atmospheric CO2
AB  - The operational constraints for a 6-electron/6-proton CO2 reduction system that operates at the concentration of CO2 in the current atmosphere (pCO2 = 400 ppm) have been evaluated on a variety of scale lengths that span from laboratory scale to global scale. Due to the low concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, limitations due to mass transport of CO2 from the tropopause have been evaluated through five different regions, each with different characteristic length scales: the troposphere; the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL); the canopy layer; a membrane layer; and an aqueous electrolyte layer. The resulting CO2 conductances, and associated physical transport limitations, will set the ultimate limit on the efficiency and areal requirements of a sustainable solar-driven CO2 reduction system regardless of the activity or selectivity of catalysts for reduction of CO2 at the molecular level. At the electrolyte/electrode interface, the steady-state limiting current density and the concomitant voltage loss associated with the CO2 concentration overpotential in a one-dimensional solar-driven CO2 reduction cell have been assessed quantitatively using a mathematical model that accounts for diffusion, migration and convective transport, as well as for bulk electrochemical reactions in the electrolyte. At pCO2 = 400 ppm, the low diffusion coefficient combined with the low solubility of CO2 in aqueous solutions constrains the steady-state limiting current density to &lt;0.1 mA cm-2 in a typical electrochemical cell with natural convection and employing electrolytes with a range of pH values. Hence, in such a system, the CO2 capture area must be 100- to 1000-fold larger than the solar photon collection area to enable a &gt;10% efficient solar-driven CO2 reduction system (based on the solar collection area). This flux limitation is consistent with estimates of oceanic CO2 uptake fluxes that have been developed in conjunction with carbon-cycle analyses for use in coupled atmosphere/ocean general circulation models. Two strategies to improve the feasibility of obtaining efficient and sustainable CO2 transport to a cathode surface at pCO2 = 400 ppm are described and modeled quantitatively. The first strategy employs yet unknown catalysts, analogous to carbonic anhydrases, that dramatically accelerate the chemically enhanced CO2 transport in the aqueous electrolyte layer by enhancing the acid-base reactions in a bicarbonate buffer system. The rapid interconversion from bicarbonate to CO2 in the presence of such catalysts near the cathode surface would in principle yield significant increases in the steady-state limiting current density and allow for &gt;10% solar-fuel operation at the cell level. The second strategy employs a thin-layer cell architecture to improve the diffusive transport of CO2 by use of an ultrathin polymeric membrane electrolyte. Rapid equilibration of CO2 at the gas/electrolyte interface, and significantly enhanced diffusive fluxes of CO2 in electrolytes, are required to increase the steady-state limiting current density of such a system. This latter approach however only is feasible for gaseous products, because liquid products would coat the electrode and therefore thicken the hydrodynamic boundary layer and accordingly reduce the diffusive CO2 flux to the electrode surface. Regardless of whether the limitations due to mass transport to the electrode surface are overcome on the laboratory scale, at global scales the ultimate CO2 flux limitations will be dictated by mass transport considerations related to transport of atmospheric CO2 to the boundary plane of the solar-driven reactor system. The transport of CO2 across the troposphere/ABL interface, the ABL/canopy layer interface, and the canopy layer/electrolyte interface have therefore been assessed in this work, to provide upper bounds on the ultimate limits for the solar-to-fuel (STF) conversion efficiency for systems that are intended to effect the reduction of atmospheric CO2 in a sustainable fashion at global scale.

TI  - Study Concerning the Expected Dynamics of the Wind Energy Resources in the Iberian Nearshore
AB  - The objective of the present study is to show a comprehensive assessment of the wind resource dynamics along the Spanish coastal environment of the Iberian Peninsula. After studying the historical resources (reported at 100 m height) for the 20-year period from 1999 to 2018 by analyzing the ERA5 time series of wind speed data, the 10 locations with highest historical wind resources are considered. For these, the study of the future dynamics for the 30-year period from 2021 to 2050 under the climate change scenario RCP 4.5 is carried out. After further selection, mean and maximum values, as well as the seasonal and monthly variability of the wind power density, are obtained for six locations along the Spanish coasts. Furthermore, a performance and economic dynamics assessment is presented for four different wind turbine technologies with rated capacities ranging between 3 and 9.5 MW. A further comparison with other locations in the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea is presented to provide a critical image of the Spanish wind resources dynamics in the European framework. The results indicate a noticeable gain of wind resources in various locations of the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts, with others presenting slight losses.

TI  - Modelling dynamic loadings of a tidal stream turbine in combined wave-current-turbulence environment
AB  - The understanding of hydrodynamic loadings on a Tidal Stream Turbine (TST) is important to its design, deployment and operation. An assessment involving combined wave-current-turbulence effects is essential for the prediction of the loadings and turbine performance. TSTs are often located in regions of localized high current, so the incident waves will be modified as they travel onto that higher current. This paper proposes a methodology which is capable of generating the combined wave-current effects with the integration of a model of the incident turbulence. The algorithm and methodology presented in this paper are implemented in the OpenFAST software. The modified numerical model has been validated by comparing its outputs to the scale model tests conducted in Edinburgh University's FloWave wave-current facility. The impact of combined waves, currents, and turbulence intensity on power production of a TST has been quantitatively investigated. The results show that the wave-current interaction effects are significant, in particular when waves travel in opposite direction to currents; in which case the loads were underestimated by 40.3% in comparison to excluding the wave-current interaction effects. Furthermore, the ambient turbulent flow is observed to affect the loadings and the performance of the TST, and the output suggests a discrepancy around 45.6% between different turbulence intensity levels.

Analysis shows that sequestration can provide time until renewable energy does become more reliable and cheaper.

TI  - Linear stability control of offshore wind turbines
AB  - Offshore wind farms in deep water are becoming an attractive prospect for harnessing renewable energy and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. One area of major concern with offshore wind turbines is stability control. The same strong winds that give deep water turbines great potential for energy capture also pose a threat to stability, along with potentially strong wave forces. We examine development of state space controllers for active stabilization of a spar-buoy floating turbine. We investigate linear state feedback with a state observer and evaluate response time and disturbance rejection of decoupled SISO controllers. Copyright Â© 2010 by ASME.

TI  - BDREA Betta and Dolphin Pods Routing via Energy Scarcity Aware Protocol for Underwater Acoustic Wireless Sensor Networks (UAWSNs)
AB  - There exist numerous applications for deploying Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs), including submarine detection, disaster prevention, oil and gas monitoring, off-shore exploration, and military target tracking. The acoustic sensor nodes are deployed to monitor the underwater environment, considering the area under observation. This research work proposes an energy scarcity-aware routing protocol for energy efficient UWSNs. Moreover, it aims to find the feasible region on the basis of the objective function, in order to minimize the energy tax and extend the network life. There are three different sensors nodes in the network environment, i.e., anchor nodes, relay nodes, and the centralized station. Anchor nodes originate data packets, while relay nodes process them and broadcast between each other until the packets reach the centralized station. The underline base scheme Weighting Depth and Forwarding Area Division Depth-Based Routing (WDFAD-DBR) for routing is based on the depth differences of the first- and second-hop nodes of the source node. The propose work, Betta and Dolphin Pods Routing via Energy Scarcity Aware protocol (BDREA) for packet forwarding from the forwarding nodes considers the first and second hops of the source node, i.e., the packet advancement, the network traffic, the distance to the centralized station, and the inverse normalized energy of the forwarding zone. It is observed that the proposed work improves the performance parameters by approximately 50\% in terms of energy efficiency, and prolongs the network life compared to Dolphin and Whale Pod (DOW-PR) protocols. Furthermore, the energy efficiency directly relates to the other parameters, and its enhancement can be seen in terms of an 18.02\% reduction in end-to-end delay when compared with the Weighting Depth and Forwarding Area Division Depth-Based Routing (WDFAD-DBR) protocol. Furthermore, BDREA improves the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) by approximately 8.71\%, compared to DOW-PR, and by 10\% compared with the benchmark, WDFAD-DBR, the energy tax by 50\% in comparison to DOW-PR, the end-to-end delay by 18\%, and the APD by 5\% in comparison to WDFAD-DBR.
