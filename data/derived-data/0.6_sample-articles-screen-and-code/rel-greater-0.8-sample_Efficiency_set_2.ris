TI  - Feasibility of the Zero-V: A zero-emissions hydrogen fuel-cell coastal research vessel
AB  - A study is presented to determine the technical, regulatory, and economic feasibility of a coastal research vessel (named the â€œZero-Vâ€) powered solely by hydrogen fuel cells. Feasibility is examined in the context of science mission profiles of particular significance in coastal oceanography that require a modern, capable, general-purpose coastal research vessel. These missions translate into the primary Zero-V vessel requirements against which technical feasibility is assessed. Hull form analysis indicated a trimaran design enables a vessel that can meet all of the space and volume requirements as well as for fitment of the machinery, service, and control spaces necessary for operation of the vessel. To meet speed and range (endurance) requirements, the vessel needs to be constructed of aluminum to reduce weight. The beam (56 feet), length (170 feet) and draft (12 feet) of the vessel enable it to dock at all primary ports of call. With 1800 kW of installed proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel-cell power for primary propulsion, the cruising speed is 10 knots. With 10,900 kg of consumable LH2 stored in two LH2 tanks, the range of the vessel is 2400 nautical miles, with an endurance of 15 days. Both the greenhouse gas (GHG) and criteria pollutant (NOx, HC, PM10) emissions were estimated based on a complete â€œwell-to-wavesâ€ (WTW) analysis. Using renewable hydrogen, the annual WTW GHG emissions predicted for the Zero-V are 91.4% less than those from an equivalent vessel running on conventional diesel fuel. Analysis of the WTW criteria pollutant emissions show that hydrogen PEM fuel-cell technology can reduce these emissions below stringent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Tier 4 marine diesel engine emissions limits regardless of whether the hydrogen is made using natural gas or renewable methods. The capital construction cost is estimated to be ~ $79 M, not unreasonable when compared to other modern diesel-fueled research vessels of similar size and capabilities. The operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs of the Zero-V were estimated to be 7.7% higher than operating the equivalent diesel-fueled vessel at the assumed fuel prices for LH2 made from steam reforming of fossil natural gas. The approach to safety for the Zero-V is described in terms of the arrangement of hazardous areas on the vessel. Regulatory review of the vessel design by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) and the Class society DNV GL found no fundamental or â€œshow-stoppingâ€ design concerns that would prevent eventual deployment of the Zero-V. Overall, this study found it feasible from technical, regulatory, and economic perspectives to design, build and operate a coastal research vessel powered solely by hydrogen fuel cells.

TI  - Bi-level optimization model applications in managing air emissions from ships: A review
AB  - Ship air emissions are recognized as one of the key concerns of the maritime industry. Competent authorities have issued various regulations to manage air emissions from ships. Although the authorities are policy makers, the effectiveness of policies is up to the shipping industry who operates the vessels and terminals to fulfill maritime transportation works. Given this characteristic, bi-level optimization model has been widely adopted in studies that optimize policy design or evaluate its effectiveness. The framework of a typical bi-level optimization model for ship emission management problem is given to show the basic structure of similar issues. A series of applications of bi-level optimization model in managing ship emissions is reviewed, including cases of Energy Efficiency Design Index, Emissions Control Area, Market Based Measure, Carbon Intensity Indicator, and Vessel Speed Reduction Incentive Program. We hope this paper can enlighten scholars interested in this area and provide help for them. Â© 2021 The Author(s)

TI  - Enhanced ship energy efficiency by using marine box coolers
AB  - Climate change, increasing fuel oil prices and new international regulation on ship emissions lead to more focus on shipping fuel consumption and energy efficiency. There are various solutions for improving the ship energy efficiency. In this manuscript, we aim to present a real case of energy saving by adopting the central cooling system with box cooler on the ship instead of conventional system. The electric energy power necessary for operating the machinery cooling system of the ship is calculated for conventional cooling system and compared to the cooling system using box coolers in term of fuel oil consumption and CO2 emissions. This study quantified the fuel saving potential that could be achieved with use of keel coolers. Adopting central cooling with box coolers may contribute in reduction of fuel oil consumption and improving the ship energy efficiency. systems. should not contain citations.

TI  - Energy storage analysis to increase large ship fuel efficiency
AB  - The marine transportation industry is a significant contributor to global emissions of CO2 and other pollutants. Although marine emission standards have become increasingly stringent, increasing fuel efficiency remains the primary objective in terms of further reducing emissions and overall marine energy use. In this paper, a hybrid powertrain is investigated as a means of increasing fuel efficiency for a modern, 100 m class, passenger vessel. The hybrid powertrain includes an Energy Storage System (ESS) based on sodium sulfur (NaS) batteries and commercially available Caterpillar diesel engine-generator sets. The ship's power load profile is based on annual averages for similar vessels. A control strategy and simulation models are developed and implemented in Simulink to analyze the power and energy flows in the hybrid powertrain. The Simulink model is used to compare the base scenario of a ship without energy storage to a hybrid scenario employing a 7.5 MWh NaS battery pack with related control strategy. Annual fuel consumption is the primary measure that is used to assess efficiency. Unlike hybrid powertrains for light-duty surface vehicle transportation, which achieve efficiency gains on the order of 10-20% [8, 9, 10], the hybrid powertrain for a large ship is estimated to lower annual fuel consumption by approximately 2%. The surprisingly small level of fuel savings is explained largely by the granularity of marine power systems, which include multiple generators that can be switched on and off to maximize fuel efficiency.

TI  - A review of low and zero carbon fuel technologies: Achieving ship carbon reduction targets
AB  - The shipping industry has paid unprecedented attention to reducing emissions and pollution in recent years. In particular, the International Maritime Organization has enacted many regulations on ship emissions, and the industry has increasingly focused on the development and application of low-carbon marine fuels. The use of low carbon alternative fuels can effectively solve the current environmental and energy problems. At present, the alternative fuels available for ships include liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, methanol, biodiesel, hydrogen and ammonia, etc. In the short term, liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, methanol technology is more mature, which can be applied to ships. In the long term, biodiesel, hydrogen fuel and ammonia fuel will inevitably become the mainstream of alternative fuels for ships. However, there are some challenges in the use of alternative fuels, such as leakage of liquefied natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas, low calorific value of methanol and biodiesel, and difficult storage of hydrogen and ammonia. This work will summarize and analyze the utilization potentiality of low carbon alternative fuel, low carbon combustion technologies for ships, and some of the new clean power technologies, which has important guiding significance for the development of low carbon fuel for ships in the future.

TI  - Causal analysis of carbon emissions, deadweight tonnage of global shipping fleet, fuel oil consumption, and economic activities in marine transportation
AB  - This paper examines the dynamic causal relationships between carbon emissions, deadweight tonnage (DWT) of the total global shipping fleet, fuel oil consumption, and economic activities for marine transportation using cointegration, error-correction, and Granger causality techniques. The intensity of carbon emissions and energy consumption, in addition to the elasticity of emissions and DWT, is discussed. It is concluded that (1) there exist long-run relationships between these variables for the period of 1980 and 2006; (2) the higher levels of economic activities induce more DWT growth than the growth of CO2 emissions; and (3) the fuel oil consumption is a weak exogenous variable to produce theCO(2)emissions. This paper also found that the cost of mitigation is increasing, and thus carbon finance is likely to become more common in the future. These results also provide policy recommendations to combat climate change.

TI  - Assessment of bulk designs enabled by the Panama Canal expansion
AB  - Traditionally seagoing vessels have been designed and optimized to operate at maximum economic speeds based on hydrodynamic considerations. More recently, high fuel prices and increased environmental concerns have challenged this practice. In combination with the introduction of stricter energy efficiency requirements, this makes design improvement a necessity for all new bulk vessels. This is in contradiction to traditional bulk vessel designs, where the focus has been on maximizing the cargo-carrying capacity at the lowest possible building cost, and not on reducing the energy consumption. Moreover, historically the Panama Canal has been an important design criterion, while the new canal locks from 2014 will significantly increase the maximum size of vessels that can sail through the canal. This expansion will enable cost cmd emission reductions through employing larger vessels or by more cost and energy efficient designs being introduced. The present paper provides an assessment of what can be achieved by employing larger bulk vessels and by introducing more energy efficient designs with focus on a vessel's beam, length and hull slenderness expressed by the length displacement ratio.

TI  - Ship impact model for technical assessment and selection of Carbon dioxide Reducing Technologies (CRTs)
AB  - It is not unreasonable to imagine that the future may herald higher energy prices and greater regulation of shipping's Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. With the introduction of the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) into MARPOL Annex VI, tools are needed to assist Naval Architects and Marine Engineers to select the best solutions to meet evolving requirements for reduced fuel consumption and associated carbon dioxide emissions. To that end, a concept design tool, the Ship Impact Model (SIM), has been developed for quickly calculating the technical performance of a vessel with one or more Carbon dioxide Reducing Technologies (CRTs) at an early design stage. The underlying basis for this model is the calculation of changes from known 'baseline ships'. The Ship Impact Model has been used in two projects to assess which selection (individual or combination) of Carbon dioxide Reducing Technologies (CRTs) have the most potential, in terms of cost-effectiveness and under other technical, operational and regulatory influences.

TI  - A Study of the Performance of Ship Diesel-Electric Propulsion Systems From an Environmental, Energy Efficiency, and Economic Perspective
AB  - Climate change and air pollution that are enormously impacted by ship emissions have become an intriguing issue, drawing consideration from the shipping industry. The shipâ€™s propulsion system is the main contributor to energy efficiency and ship emissions. This research paper presents a solution to this issue through propelling the ship by using a diesel-electric propulsion system instead of the conventional one. As a case study, a passenger ship is investigated. The results showed that the proposed electric propulsion system has lower emission rates than the conventional one by 10%, 21%, and 88% for Carbon dioxide, Nitrogen oxides and Sulfur dioxide emissions, respectively. From an energy efficiency point of view, the diesel-electric propulsion system enhances the energy efficiency and complies with the required International Maritime Organization (IMO) values, as actual energy efficiency is about 66%, 70%, 83%, and 95% of the required IMO values at baseline, Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3, respectively. From the economic point of view, the annual costs are $2.5 and $3.05 million for both diesel-electric and conventional propulsion systems, respectively. This shows that the annual cost of the diesel-electric option is less than that of the conventional by 22%. Â© 2022, Marine Technology Society Inc.. All rights reserved.

TI  - Dynamic model for the economical evaluation of different technical solutions for reducing naval emissions
AB  - The new regulations for the prevention of marine pollution are compelling the shipping industry to a change of strategy. This research provides an economical analysis of the short term alternative options for ship owners: to fit exhaust gas cleaning system on board using heavy fuel oil; to burn marine gas oil or to switch from heavy fuel oil to low sulfur fuel entering emissions controlled areas. An economic evaluation model of investments has been developed in order to compare the different solutions. Based on technical data of engines and operative vessel profiles, the model provides possible measurement tools to consider for the investment choice in the defined reference scenario. Different scenarios can be created by modifying investment conditions, environmental regulations and fuel price forecasts. The results of the model application to three real vessels of different types encourage the ship owners to adopt the option of the seawater scrubber. Copyright Â© 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

TI  - Norwegian ship-owners' adoption of alternative fuels
AB  - The shipping sector's rising greenhouse gas emissions are often considered â€œhard-to-abateâ€. Some ship-owners have recently adopted or started to consider the adoption of alternative fuels, but systematic studies of this are still lacking. We address this gap by studying how ship-owners differ in both actual and intended adoption of alternative fuels. We analyze data from a unique survey with 281 ship-owners in Norway, a major ship-owning country and center for maritime technology development, with descriptive statistics and analysis of variance. We find early adopters among large and established ship-owners in offshore, international cargo and domestic passenger shipping segments, which are often subjected to specific contractual demands for alternative fuel adoption. Laggards were typically small and young ship-owners operating in shipping segments where demands for alternative fuel adoption are weak. Our findings also suggest that firms' business strategy and financial and knowledge resources may have relevance for ship-owner's adoption of alternative fuels. Our study has implications for national and international policymaking, highlighting for example how contracting mechanisms can be an effective tool in incentivizing the adoption of alternative fuels.

TI  - A review of energy efficient methods for all-electric ships
AB  - With stringent environmental regulations and growing concerns on energy consumption of the marine transport sector, there is a serious effort to make on board energy system more efficient. Improving fuel efficiency is conceived as a sustainable measure in terms of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and overall marine energy use. As such, electrification of ship propulsion has been introduced as a solution for operating at higher efficiency and hence more saving fuel. However, energy efficiency in the context of marine transport is to be more stringent over time as required by International Maritime Organization (IMO). The energy performance indicators to evaluate such requirements include Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI). Several energy efficient methods are therefore proposed to further improve fuel efficiency on board electric vessels. These involve integration of energy storage system, implementation of DC distribution, optimal power distribution and scheduling as well as various operational practices that are currently applicable for existing conventional vessels. The paper summaries the concept of ship energy efficiency in terms of the standard indicators and provide a brief review on the energy efficiency improvement strategies published in literature. The aim of the review is to analyze the methods that are potential to incorporate into the autonomous system of all-electric vessels. The results show a significant variation in reported efficiency gain and thus a combination of various methods is suggested to achieve full potential for emissions reduction.

TI  - POWER REDUCTION CONSIDERATIONS FOR BULK CARRIERS WITH RESPECT TO NOVEL ENERGY EFFICIENCY REGULATIONS
AB  - After introducing an energy efficiency design index (EEDI) in 2011, International Maritime Organization (IMO) pursued their short-and long-term goals to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships by presenting, among others, an energy efficiency existing ship index (EEXI). Contrary to EEDI which is used for new ships solely, EEXI is addressing an energy efficiency of already built ships and is set to become formally applicable starting from 2023. Existing designs cannot be essentially and rapidly changed to comply the criterion. The only main particular from the preliminary design phase that can be meaningly optimized â€œpost festumâ€ is a required engine power, and thus, the speed. Therefore, the paper explores the effect of EEXI policy on a fleet of 153 bulk carriers built between 2000 and 2020 in order to address their near future and prompt design changes, specifically considering the power reduction. For that purpose, an attained and a required EEXI are calculated for each ship. The results showed that only 15% of the ships built in 2000-2012 satisfied 2013-2014 IMO criterion. This impacted the design of ships built in 2013-2022, as they complied the same criterion by 88% of share. However, no ship from the whole database satisfied the present day EEDI requirement and only one ship fulfilled the contemporary EEXI requirement meaning that the current designs are not able to match the emerging criteria to a large extent. In order to meet an energy efficiency criterion, a main engine power reduction and speed are predicted assuming that the engine power and shaft limiter are installed. The investigation showed that MCR reduction of the total fleet taken into account had to be reduced by 50% and speed by 15% on average in order for ships to meet current requirements. Moreover, a graphic method is developed for the estimation of EEXI by using only deadweight (DWT) and maximum continuous rating (MCR). The proposed simplified method based on average values could be used on existing bulk carriers with an aim to satisfy novel regulation with application of â€œeasy to useâ€ approach. Additionally, authors discussed other options to reliably evaluate an energy efficiency of existing ships. Â© 2022, University of Zagreb Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture.

TI  - Technoeconomic and environmental assessment of HyForce, a hydrogen-fuelled harbour tug
AB  - The call for concerted global action against the climate change impact is well heard. 191 countries would communicate their progressive plans through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as signatories to the Paris Agreement. Harbour crafts as part of the larger maritime ecosystem, can significantly contribute to reduced emissions. In this paper, HyForce, the next generation 2 MW hydrogen powered virtual tugboat was designed for a feasibility assessment for her techno-economic and environmental footprint to replace existing diesel-powered tugboats. The study compares the use of hydrogen fuel cells and an internal combustion engine to perform the same dynamic load profile for a typical tugboat mission. The results from the study show that a signpost for commercial competitiveness of HyForce is influenced primarily by the projected liquid hydrogen cost of 5.10 USD per kg in 2040 with a 2,000 USD/kW capital cost for the fuel cells. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from a â€œwell-to-wakeâ€ analysis for fossil-based hydrogen and renewable hydrogen supply chains were conducted, and the results show 26.9% and 75.6% reduction, respectively, compared to similar tug running on diesel fuel.

TI  - Emissions assessment of a tanker in a chilean port using bi-directional cold ironing integrated to LNG
AB  - Air pollution in coastal cities and nearby communities has become a health problem in the last decades because of the dispersion of pollutants produced by the various port activities. In this context, when a vessel at berth uses its auxiliary engines to generate the electric power to maintain its service, the operational profile is not continuous; the auxiliary engines work outside their fuel efficiency range, producing additional pollutant emissions. To reduce emissions while in port and at berth, two short-term options are considered: the first option is using alternative energy sources such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) instead of current fuels. The second option is using cold ironing technology, which enables to turn-off the vessels auxiliary engines, by feeding the services using shore power supply. In a classical cold ironing configuration, energy only flows from shore to on board. This work presents an emissions assessment of a tanker vessel at berth, applying a novel bi-directional energy flow strategy associated to a cold ironing system, integrating LNG, and compared to current fuels used, focused on the environmental impact on Quintero's Bay. This bay is one of the most important port areas of the Chilean coast deemed to be affected by emissions generated by intense port activities. Taking current fuels such as heavy fuel oil (HFO) and marine diesel oil (MDO) and ship's arrivals/departures from port as a reference case, the results presented in this work, show a significant reduction in emissions when applying the bi-directional energy flow strategy.

TI  - Energy efficiency approach in the O&G offshore operation: Vessel lng propelled
AB  - Among the biggest challenges involves today the Oil Companies it is important the ability to respond to the needs of the marine environment preservation. Eni is strictly committed in the reduction of CO2, NOX and SOX emissions. Due to increasingly stricter environmental regulations controlling air pollution from ships implemented through International Maritime Organization (IMO) Annex VI and the other local air quality controls, together with the potential for favourable price conditions, the use of LNG as a fuel, instead of conventional residual or distillate marine fuels, is expected to become more widely adopted in the future. LNG has different hazards than traditional fuel oil; therefore, operators must clearly understand the risks involves with LNG bunkering. The primary driver for selecting LNG as fuel were competitive pricing in terms of long-Term prospect and environmental stewardship and sustainability. Companies view this conversion as a significant step to reduce their CO2 footprint, which is a major concern to customers across industry that are prioritizing "greener" ship design with technology aimed at reducing emissions. Another deciding factor is the age of the existing fleet. For new vessels the life cycle economics favoured conversion at the time of consideration. For older vessels, on the other hand, new build programs provided the opportunity for new LNG OSV construction. Companies which adopt LNG as a fuel, should expect to invest more time to maintain and care for their vessels to meet 30 year life cycle, but on the positive side, the use of LNG, with its lower carbon content, move out as much as 80% longer some of the maintenance intervals. In terms of obstacles faced following the initial decision, early adopters unanimously agree that one of the biggest challenges has involved learning the myriad complexities of the operation and project work scope, not only technically, but also from a regulatory standpoint; requiring as a consequence a full-Time commitment to the project by all Stakeholders (Companies, Local and International Administration, Shipyards, etc.). The increasing use of LNG on board the OSV instead the MGO, is a necessary step in order to reduce CO2, NOX and SOX emissions and to be in compliance with the new parameters, already defined till 2050. The unanimous request from the International Organization (ONU) and Maritime Regulation (MARPOL) is to reduce till 50% the CO2, NOX and SOX, especially in the SECA Areas. Taking in consideration real cases, the analysis carried out shows that by replacing the LNG to MGO and using new-generation engines on board the OSV, gas emissions offshore can be immediately reduced up to 30%.

TI  - Acoustic Emission Method Evaluation for High Speed Ship Engines Condition Monitoring
AB  - Thanks to new technologies, which allow to increase engine motor resource, high speed diesel engines are becoming more popular in the marine industry. This is due to their small size and relatively high power capacity. These machines mostly are used as the vessels auxiliary engines and as emergency energy supplier. Last decade we can see a trend of high speed diesel use as main engines, particularly for vessels with diesel- electric power propulsion. Last accidents revealed that number of the engines damages appear without any symptom. Available information shows that significant number of accidents is caused by malfunction and defects in cylinder pack (liner, piston, cylinder head). To prevent drastic consequences, detection of abnormalities in the early stage is extremely important {[}3-5]. Our research during four years was focused on AE method implementation for the engine condition monitoring.

TI  - Source apportionment of PM2.5 at IMPROVE monitoring sites within and outside of marine vessel fuel sulfur emissions control areas
AB  - Fuel sulfur emissions control areas have been established in a few marine coastal regions to reduce environmental impacts from combustion of high sulfur residual fuel oil (RFO). For example, in August of 2012, the U.S. began enforcing fuel sulfur limits on certain large commercial marine vessels up to 200 nautical miles (nm) of its coasts as part of a North American Emissions Control Area (NA-ECA), and in January of 2014, the U.S. began enforcing fuel sulfur limits on these vessels within up to 50 nm of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands as part of the U.S. Caribbean Sea ECA (USCAR-ECA). This work evaluates ECA effectiveness at reducing PM2.5 from combustion of RFO by using both spatial analysis, comparing PM2.5 source apportionment at IMPROVE monitoring sites largely impacted by air from either inside or outside of an ECA, along with temporal analysis, comparing RFO combustion impacts pre and post ECA enforcement at sites largely impacted by air from inside an ECA. Source apportionment was performed using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) on chemically speciated PM2.5 data from 2009 to 2018. Results for 7 coastal U.S. IMPROVE sites influenced by marine air masses within the NA-ECA showed an annual mean reduction of PM2.5 from RFO combustion of 79.0\% (range, 60.2\% to 91.5\%) when comparing impacts from the pre-ECA (RFO average 2.7\% S) period of 2009-2011 to the ECA 0.1\% fuel S period of 2015-2018. In contrast, the Virgin Islands, Big Bend, and Baengnyeong Island South Korea IMPROVE sites were impacted by RFO combustion and were largely or wholly influenced by air masses from outside of an emissions control area. These sites saw a statistically significant 14.0\% increase, a 21.0\% decrease, or no statistically significant change, respectively, when comparing time periods pre and post ECA enforcement. Implications: This study performs source apportionment on PM2.5 monitoring data to identify 10 sites impacted by residual fuel oil combustion, mainly from marine vessel fuel use. The paper then evaluates the effects of enforcement of marine vessel fuel sulfur emissions control areas at reducing ambient impacts of this source on PM2.5. This study uses both temporal analysis of the source apportionment results, comparing source impacts before and after enforcement of marine vessel fuel sulfur emissions control areas, and spatial analysis, comparing source impacts between sites largely impacted or not impacted by airmasses originating inside of marine vessel fuel sulfur emissions control areas.

TI  - Fuel demand and emissions for maritime sector in Fiji: Current status and low-carbon strategies
AB  - The Green Growth Framework for Fiji under its theme for sustainable maritime transportation, envisages deployment of renewable energy technologies, retrofitting of existing vessels and development of improved vessel designs as some of the measures needed to make shipping more energy efficient. In this study, the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP) tool is used to develop various maritime transport scenarios (2016â€“2040) based on possible interventions. Domestic maritime transport used approximately 79 million litres of fuel in 2016 out of which 77% was marine diesel oil while the remaining was premix. The total emissions from maritime transport in 2016 was estimated to be 214 Gg of CO 2 e. At 2% annual growth rate in maritime passenger and freight activity, the total annual fuel consumption will increase to 127 million litres by 2040 with corresponding GHG emissions of 342 Gg of CO 2 e under the BAU scenario. This paper quantifies possible reductions in fossil fuel usage and associated emissions through energy efficiency and alternative fuels in the domestic sea transport sector in Fiji.

TI  - Large two-stroke marine diesel engine operation with a high-pressure SCR system in heavy weather conditions
AB  - The transient performance of a direct-drive large two-stroke marine diesel engine, installed in a vessel operating in a seaway with heavy weather, is investigated via simulation. The main engine of the ship is equipped with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) aftertreatment system for compliance with the latest International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules for NOx reduction, IMO Tier III. Because of limitations of exhaust gas temperature at the inlet of SCR systems and the low temperature exhaust gases produced by marine diesel engines, in marine applications, the SCR system is installed on the high-pressure side of the turbine. When a ship sails in heavy weather, it experiences a resistance increase, wave-induced motions, and a time-varying flow field in the propeller, induced by ship motions. This results in a fluctuation of the propeller torque demand and, thus, a fluctuation in engine power and exhaust gas temperature, which can affect engine and SCR performance. To investigate this phenomenon and take into account the engineâ€“propeller interaction, the entire propulsion plant was modeled, namely, the slow-speed diesel propulsion engine, the high-pressure SCR system, the directly driven propeller, and the shipâ€™s hull. To simulate the transient propeller torque demand, a propeller model was used, and torque variations due to ship motions were taken into account. Ship motions in waves and wave-added resistance were calculated for regular and irregular waves using a 3D panel code. The coupled model was validated against available measured data from a shipboard propulsion system in good weather conditions. The model was then used to simulate the behavior of a Tier III marine propulsion plant during acceleration from low to medium load, in the presence of regular and irregular waves. The effect of the time-varying propeller demand on the engine and the SCR system was investigated. Â© 2021 Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers. All rights reserved.

TI  - Hybrid Propulsion Systems for Small Ships: Context and Challenges
AB  - New generations of ship must meet new challenges, particularly in terms of energy efficiency, reliability and environmental impacts. One of the future goals of shipbuilding is to reduce the impact of ship emissions to respond to existent and future regulations of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) on greenhouse gas and pollutants emissions. In this context, Hybrid Propulsion Systems (HPS) are promising solutions to meet these requirements. This work presents a state of the art of hybrid propulsion systems for small vessels. The paper includes a general description of the future challenges for shipbuilding and a description of the possible topologies of HPS which can be implemented in small ships. The key features of the HPS components are also described and several electric and hybrid propulsion small ship are presented

TI  - On the collision safety of a gas fuelled 6500 TEU container vessel
AB  - Scheduled international environmental regulations are resulting in an increasing interest to use Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) as fuel for ships. However, the well known potential of LNG to reduce emissions must not increase the potential risks compared to conventional fuels. The Maritime Safety Committee has published an Interim Guidelines MSC.285(86) which includes a collision safety rule for gas fuelled vessels which requests a minimal distance of the LNG storage tanks from the ship outer shell (B/5-Rule). However, research work is needed regarding the actual crashworthiness of alternative ship designs with an LNG tank position closer to the ship shell than the B/5-Rule. A minimum safety concept actually discussed requires that LNG fuelled vessels shall have a collision resistance at least similar to the one of LNG carriers. In the present paper a case study is presented where the collision resistance of a gas fuelled 6500 TEU Container Vessel is investigated based on the GL-Rules I-1-33. The Container Vessel has an alternative design to the B/5-Rule exploiting more cargo hold space for LNG bunckering by placing the LNG tanks at 8% of B from the side shell. The crashworthiness of the Container Vessel is compared to the one of an LNG tanker of approximately the same size. Numerical computations indicate that the critical collision speed up to penetration of the inner hull is larger for the LNG carrier. For the more relevant case of LNG spill the Container Vessel with alternative design has an increased crashworthiness compared to the LNG tanker. It is shown that the critical collision speed for the Container Vessel is almost twice the one of the LNG tanker in case of an LNG spill. Copyright Â© 2012 by ASME.

TI  - Numerical investigation to increase ship efficiency in regular head waves using an alternative engine control strategy
AB  - According to the International Maritime Organization (IMO)'s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) strategy whose aim is to reduce the shipping industry's total carbon emissions by 50\% by the year 2050, it is desirable to increase ships energy efficiency to reduce GHG emissions and fuel costs. To do so, a short-term measure is to develop innovative engine control strategies in waves that will reduce ship's GHG emissions. In this study, a mathematical model is developed to assess two engine control strategies: the standard constant rotational speed mode and an innovative constant fuel rack approach. The coupled model is made of a mean value engine, propeller curves and a ship behavior simulator. Emphasis is placed on the presentation of the engine model and references are given for further details on the ship simulator. After verifying the coupling between the engine model and the ship simulator, the fuel consumption is compared, for the two strategies, at the same average speed and for three head regular waves. This paper presents the basics of a further long time research project and shows that coupling ship simulators with engine simulators leads to promising simulation tools for a ship's GHG emissions reduction. Results from a first application case show that the constant fuel rack approach reduces fuel consumption (up to 1.6\%).

TI  - Tracking Control for Hydrogen Fuel Cell Systems in Zero-Emission Ferry Ships
AB  - For more than a century, conventional marine vessels spatter the atmosphere with CO2 emissions and detrimental particles when operated by diesel motors/generators. Fuel cells have recently emerged as one of the most promising emission-free technologies for the electrification of ship propulsion systems. In fuel cell-based ship electrification, the entire marine power system is viewed as a direct current (DC) microgrid (MG) with constant power loads (CPLs). A challenge of such settings is how to stabilize the voltages and currents of the ship's grid. In this paper, we propose a new modified backstepping controller to stabilize the MG voltage and currents. Finally, to study the performance and efficiency of our proposal, we run an experiment simulation using dSPACE real-time emulator.

TI  - Environmental regulations spark power savings, reliability and safety
AB  - Increasingly stringent environmental policies are causing sea vessels to look at ways to adapt to reduce emissions. Thankfully, as marine operators explore new ship designs and technologies for achieving cleaner operations, they are also realizing other benefits from hybrid drives and energy storage solutions-including improved safety, reliability and cost savings. The technology has undergone significant advances across a wide range of marine applications over the past several years. The modernization of the ship would generate significant fuel savings, but the overall advantages would stem from energy storage. The ability to use energy reserves generated from the new technology would enable modernization with advanced, power-hungry weapons systems. The US Navy sources indicate hybrid-electric drives will increase vessel mission efficiency by allowing increased time at posts. Adding propulsion-derived ship service, or PDSS, to the HED increases the gains to 12 to 15 percent.

TI  - Environmental Sustainability of Arctic Shipping through Potential HFO-banned Areas along the NSR
AB  - Owing to the emergent trends in Arctic shipping, different market and policy-based measures would be considered to minimize the negative impacts from vessel-based emissions to the fragile Arctic sea environment. This study analyzes the effectiveness of enforcing HFO-banned areas and emission tax for the environmental sustainability of Arctic shipping. The locations of potential HFO-banned areas are analyzed with an optimization model to minimize the total emissions and cost separately and three scenarios are analyzed with free-ice, medium-ice, and heavy-ice conditions based on daily ice-thickness data obtained from the Arctic Data ArchiveTOPAZ4 system. The analysis is done for a voyage from Asia to Europe and vessel speeds and location data are gathered from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). Vessel-based emissions are estimated following the IMO fourth GHGs study in 2020 which incorporates the vessel's engine load, propulsive power demanded at different speeds, and fuel consumption with auxiliary engines and boilers, among others. A spatial variation of the selected HFO-banned areas is observed when changing ice conditions while producing different levels of CO2, CH4, N2O, BC, and SOx emissions. Although the enforcement of HFO-banned areas and emission tax reduces the total emissions, it significantly increases the total cost of the voyage. The medium-ice condition generates the least emission level and significantly different results are derived from environmental and economic objectives with all scenarios.

TI  - Design and evaluation of LNG-hydrogen hybrid propulsion system for LNG carrier
AB  - Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) in International Maritime Organization (IMO) is regulating the CO2 emission from vessels by an established index called the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI). The EEDI is applied to every ocean-going vessel and ratified to be stringent with respect to time; the CO2 emission should be reduced by 30 % in 2022 (Phase 3) and by 40 % in 2025 (Phase 4) from the emission level of 2013. Although the LNG-fuelled propulsion system has been developed to reduce the green-house gas emission, it hardly meet the regulation in Phase 4, and consequently some fuel without green-house gas emission should be combined with LNG. This study proposes the LNG-hydrogen hybrid system of a LNG carrier with 154K, 210K, and 267K cargo capacity and discusses some issues including the relative ratio of hydrogen with respect to LNG, the size of hydrogen fuel tanks, and operating complexities to satisfy the step-by-step regulations. An appropriate ratio of hydrogen fuel to satisfy the environmental regulation is estimated to more than 12% and 27% for Phase 4 and 5 respectively. The tank size of liquid hydrogen for the ship is estimated 1,300 âˆ¼ 3,300 m3, and the power of a fuel cell is required to be 4.9 âˆ¼ 11.8 MW. Optimising the hybrid propulsion system considering the spatial, operational, and economic feasibility for the hybrid propulsion system is identified as a future challenge.

TI  - How to Deploy Electric Ships for Green Shipping
AB  - Maritime transport plays an important role in global economic development but also inevitably faces increasing pressures from all sides, such as ship operating cost reduction and environmental protection. An ideal innovation to address these pressures is electric ships, which are more environmentally friendly than conventional manned fuel oil ships. The electric ship is in its early stages. To provide high-quality transportation services, the service network needs to be designed carefully. Therefore, this research simultaneously studies the location of charging stations, charging plans, route planning, ship scheduling, and ship deployment under service time requirements. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model with the objective of minimizing total cost comprised of charging cost, construction cost of charging stations, and fixed cost of ships. A case study using the data of the shipping network along the Yangtze River is conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the model. Valuable managerial insights are also derived from sensitivity analyses.

TI  - Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) for Inland Vessels in Bangladesh
AB  - This paper attempts to evaluate EEDI for inland vessels in Bangladesh.To assess the present situation of inland class vessels in terms of CO2 emission, 526 cargo ships, 247 passenger ships, 70 oil tankers and 36 ferries have been taken in this study. The formulated baseline equations based on the study of different types of Inland vessels have been compared with the IMO evaluated baseline equations for International Shipping. The effect of EEDI with respect to vessels draft, type of fuel, block coefficient, specific fuel consumption (SFC) and power has also been investigated. Finally, some viable recommendations have been proposed to reduce the detrimental effects of CO2 emission by optimizing hull shape of some existing vessels. (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI  - LNG as fuel for a deep sea dry bulk carrier
AB  - New environmental regulations indicate that a 'business as usual' approach is no longer an option towards sustainable shipping. LNG is one of the potential alternative solutions to help meet the specified IMO fuel sulphur content limits since it contains only traces of sulphur. Gas and dual fuel (DF) engines utilizing the Otto combustion process can produce NOx emissions below the IMO Tier III limits, and the C/H ratio of LNG allows a significant fuel based reduction of CO2 emissions also. This paper discusses the challenges involved and how these were met when considering LNG as fuel in an ocean-going dry bulk carrier, with a focus on the main challenges involved with CAPEX and engine technologies and their effect on vessel design. The study was conducted by Arista Shipping in conjunction with the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) and WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤, and was based on a representative bulk carrier design, an 82,000 dwt Kamsarmax vessel, which was selected as the project platform due to its proven design and high cargo capacity.

TI  - WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤ RT-flex96C: The world's most powerful engine enters service
AB  - WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤ Corporation has developed the world's most powerful engine, 14-cylinder RT-flex96C, for a large, fast container vessel, which entered into service on September 1, 2006. The low-speed engine is based on an already well-established 12-cylinder RT-flex96C design, which was developed from the RTA96C engine type widely applied in container ships since 1998. It provides unparalleled flexibility in the way the engines operates, resulting in smokeless operation at all operating speeds, lower fuel consumption, reduced maintenance costs, and lower steady operating speeds for better maneuvering. An important feature of the engine is the high-efficiency waste heat recovery system, which provides major savings in fuel consumption and reductions in exhaust gas emissions. The engine also extends the power available to suit the new generation of large containerships, with the complete flexibility of RT-flex common-rail technology.

TI  - Improvement of Environmental and Energy Efficiency of Marine Engines by Utilizing the Ecological Recirculation of Gas Heat in an Absorption Chiller
AB  - Technical regulation is carried out based on the real possibility of ensuring the required level of environmental friendliness of harmful emissions. Requirements for the environmental safety of ships are developed by the International Marine Organization (IMO). The requirements of IMO standards, applications, and protocols of the MARPOL 73/78 convention regulate technical, organizational, and legal environmental protection issues at sea. Their implementation often leads to a reduction of the economic and energy performance of marine diesel engines. However, the main difficulties in ensuring the environmental safety of internal combustion engines are associated with the selectivity of the components of the exhaust gases system. The innovative scheme of Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system with using the heat of recirculation gas by absorption chiller (ACh) for cooling the air at the intake of main ship engine is proposed. The effect of using the heat of recirculation gas for cooling engine intake air is analyzed considering the changing climatic conditions on the vesselâ€™s route line. The results of calculations have shown reducing the emissions of harmful substances (NOX by 26 to 39%; SOX by 9 to 14%) when the engine is running with recirculation of gas.

TI  - Feasibility study of an integrated COGES-DF engine power plant in LNG propulsion for a cruise-ferry
AB  - The feasibility study of an integrated COmbined Gas Electric and Steam-reciprocating engine propulsion plant for a Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) fueled cruise-ferry is assessed in this paper. Specifically, the purpose of this work is to respond to GNV shipownersâ€™ need to equip ships with a propulsion system highly efficient in a wide ship speed range. The issue was addressed through the repowering study of the GNV La Suprema ship. Several power plant configurations based on different dual-fuel (DF) engine and gas turbine combinations have been tested in a cogeneration efficiency maximization study performed over a wide ship speed range. Afterwards, the best power plant was identified. Analysis showed that COmbined Gas Electric and Steam (COGES) plants have a great potential for marine propulsion application due to their benefits in cogeneration efficiency, emissions and required volumes. Furthermore, integrating a COmbined Gas Electric and Steam plant with small size dual-fuel engines revealed high cogeneration efficiency over wide ship operating conditions. The propulsion plant comprising a COmbined Gas Electric and Steam plant based on GE25.1 gas turbine and small size dual-fuel engines was proved to guarantee high cogeneration efficiency (47â€“52%) over a wide ship speed range (16â€“26 knots). In particular, a 51% cogeneration efficiency is provided for the current operating condition of GNV La Suprema. Moreover, the energy efficiency design index (EEDI) for the different investigated plants has been also evaluated, to verify their compliance with IMO limits. The selected propulsion plant provides an EEDI margin of 1.42â€“2.89 gCO2/(t*nm) with respect to the 2025 requirements. Finally, economic analysis was performed for four different ship routes and capital/operational costs have been computed. Overall, the proposed COmbined Gas Electric and Steam-reciprocating engine power plant revealed to be economically feasible over all of the operating conditions accounted for. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Natural gas as a marine propulsion fuel Energy and environmental benefits in urban ferry service
AB  - Although transportation has major energy and environmental policy implications, not all sectors are treated equally, and ships often are overlooked. However, ships are a significant source of air pollution and account for a nontrivial portion of U.S. petroleum demand. Moderate emissions standards for new marine engines have been proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency, but these will take well over a decade to become effective once they are enacted, and there are no energy policy provisions for ships. Nonetheless, ships offer cost-effective options for both emissions reductions and the use of alternative fuels. Aware of these issues, the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Transportation Technologies and the Gas Research Institute sponsored a study of the potential use of natural gas as the fuel for passenger ferries as part of their Natural Gas Vehicle Technology Initiative. The results of the study are discussed, with a focus on the energy and environmental issues related to maritime operations in the United States. The challenges and opportunities of a specific project to design, construct, and operate several natural gas-powered ferries in Boston Harbor are discussed. A significant reduction in air pollution and a large increase in the use of natural gas as a transportation fuel are expected from this project, but the greenhouse gas emission impacts are ambiguous. Further, an emissions monitoring and analysis program is described that would greatly improve the accuracy of maritime emissions inventories and would enable ships to take part in existing emissions trading programs in port cities around the country. Such a development would create significant economic incentives to encourage ferry owners to invest in clean fuel technologies, which could have major implications for energy and environmental policy.

TI  - Container fleet renewal considering multiple sulfur reduction technologies and uncertain markets amidst COVID-19
AB  - The onset of 2020 is marked by stricter restrictions on maritime sulfur emissions and the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this background, liner companies now face the challenge to find suitable sulfur reduction technologies, make reasonable decisions on fleet renewal, and prepare stable operation plans under the highly uncertain shipping market. Considering three sulfur reduction technologies, namely, fuel-switching, scrubber, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) dual-fuel engine, this paper develops a robust optimization model based on two-stage stochastic linear programming (SLP) to formulate a decision plan for container fleet, which can deal with various uncertainties in future: freight demand, ship charter rate, fuel price, retrofit time and Sulfur Emission Control Area (SECA) ratio. The main decision contents include ship acquisition, ship retrofit, ship sale, ship charter, route assignment, and speed optimization. The effectiveness of our plan was verified through a case study on two liner routes from the Far East to Northwest America, operated by COSCO Shipping Lines. The results from SLP model show that large-capacity fuel-switching ships and their LNG dual-fuel engine retrofits should be included in the long-term investment and operation plan; slow-steaming is an important operational decision for ocean liner shipping; if the current SECA boundary is not further expanded or the sulfur emission restrictions not further tightened, the scrubber ship will have no advantage in investment cost and operation. However, considering the probabilities of more flexible scenarios, the results from the robust model suggest that it is beneficial to install scrubber on medium-capacity fuel-switching ships, and carry out more LNG dual-fuel engine retrofits for large-capacity fuel-switching ships. Compared with SLP, this robust strategy greatly reduces sulfur emissions while slightly pushing up carbon emissions.

TI  - Comparative study of a hybrid research vessel utilizing batteries or hydrogen fuel cells
AB  - The Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) current coastal/local research vessel, the R/V Robert Gordon Sproul, is nearing the end of its service life and will soon require replacement. This study compares three potential variants for an R/V Sproul replacement vessel (SRV): a Baseline SRV consisting of a traditional diesel-electric powertrain, a Battery Hybrid SRV (battery/diesel-electric) and a Hydrogen Hybrid SRV (hydrogen fuel cell/diesel-electric). All three variants meet the science mission requirements of the SRV but with varying levels of zero-emission runtime, energy efficiency and emissions. The Battery Hybrid SRV can provide 2.5 h of zero emissions (battery only) operation, but could not complete any of the identified SRV science missions without also engaging the diesel generators. In contrast, the Hydrogen Hybrid SRV can provide 23.4 h of zero emission (hydrogen only) runtime, and can complete 74% of the SRV science missions solely with zero-emission operation. The superior performance of the Hydrogen Hybrid SRV is attributable to the higher volumetric energy storage density of the LH2/fuel cell combination. The capital costs of these vessels are estimated to be: âˆ¼ $21.4 M for the diesel-electric Baseline SRV, âˆ¼ $26.0 M for the Battery Hybrid SRV vessel and âˆ¼ $34.4 M for the Hydrogen Hybrid SRV. The â€œwell-to-wavesâ€ (WTW) greenhouse gas (GHG) and criteria pollutant emissions were estimated using various sourcings for the diesel fuel, electricity and hydrogen fuel. The lowest emission levels are achieved with the Hydrogen Hybrid variant using 100% renewable hydrogen. The annual WTW GHG emissions from the Hydrogen Hybrid using renewable LH2 in combination with fossil diesel in the hybrid arrangement yields a 26.7% GHG emissions reduction from the Baseline vessel using fossil-derived diesel fuel. The Battery Hybrid vessel with 100% renewable electricity combined with diesel fuel provides a 6.9% reduction in GHG emissions. Similar results are seen for the criteria pollutant emissions. The hybrid vessels are also compared with regard to operational safety. The study reveals that hydrogen fuel-cell technology provides an effective hybrid supplement to diesel power for a coastal/local research vessel. Â© 2021

TI  - Enhanced application and emission control possibilities with electronically controlled low speed diesels
AB  - Two-stroke low speed diesels dominate the main propulsion engine market, being selected for nearly 80% of all ocean-going vessels. The main reason is the simplicity of the direct-coupled installation, the high reliability and the high thermal efficiencies. Four-stroke medium speed engines take the last 20 %, except on the LNG carrier propulsion field where steam turbines, while being threatened, still prevail. The occasional exception to the above is a few gas turbines in passenger (cruise) vessels. Recently, two-stroke low speed diesels have been developed for electronically controlled fuel injection systems, and such engines are now gaining momentum in the industry. The electronically (rather than cam) controlled fuel injection systems bring with it many operational benefits, which will be outlined in the paper. One such feature is the ability to inject very small fuel amounts safely through the same injectors as those able for full power operation. This paves the way for a more simple and safe version of large low speed dual fuel gas engines for propulsion of LNG carriers, representing significant fuel and gas saving possibilities, reducing CO2 emissions, and also opening new frontiers for low emission high-efficiency ship propulsion systems in other vessel types, including the largest types, as well as land based power generation. The paper will outline the technology, especially with a view to emission control and its economical and environmental potential.

TI  - Reducing pollutant emissions from vessel maneuvering in port areas
AB  - We propose an activity-based model to calculate ships' exhaust emissions while maneuvering in port. The exhaust emissions from the seven international commercial ports in Taiwan (namely Kaohsiung, Keelung, Taichung, Taipei, Hualien, Anping, and Suao) were calculated using actual data. Then, the regional ship exhaust emissions were estimated based on the number and size of ships and the type of fuel they used. Our method of predicting and evaluating the effectiveness of green port policies is shown to be intuitive and precise. Small vessels, which are the most common vessel type to enter and leave Taiwan ports, were shown to generate most of the emissions, but unit emissions from large vessels were the highest among three types of vessels (i.e., small, medium, and large). Moreover, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions corresponded to sailing speed. Taiwan International Ports Co., Ltd (TIPC) has slightly reduced carbon dioxide equivalent and sulfur oxide emissions by implementing a green port policy, consisting of multiple ways of building a sustainable port environment (such as vessel speed reduction and use of low-sulfur oil). However, nitrogen oxide emissions have not decreased significantly. Our findings indicate that lower speeds and onshore power supply can reduce local air pollution, and assist transportation authorities, who should consistently monitor GHG emissions in port, to proactively respond to the International Maritime Organization's regulations for ensuring a sustainable future.

TI  - Dual-fuel ME-GI engine operation on large LNG carriers (Q-flex and Q-max vessels)
AB  - Today, greenhouse gases and exhaust gas emissions are rightly high on the agenda for all ships owners, operators and charterers. With this in mind, a Charterer Certificate (Green Award Certificate) can be awarded to those demonstrating reduced emissions and fuel oil consumption and increased shipping efficiency. Therefore, a working group of maritime companies (Qatargas Operating Company Ltd. (QG), RasGas Company Ltd. (RG), ConocoPhillips and Rio Tinto) was established to develop a strategy to meet and demonstrate the targets required to achieve this Charterer Certificate. The group has identified the operation of Dual Fuel Main Engine Gas Injection (ME-GI) Engines as a way to help do so. In consideration of the above, a total of 45 Q-Flex and Q-Max vessels chartered to Qatargas Operating Company Ltd. (QG) and RasGas Company Ltd. (RG) are being considered for conversion to Dual Fuel Gas Injection (ME-GI) Engine. Using Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) vapour for the operation of Electronically Controlled High Pressure Gas Injection Engine for propulsion of ships, the conversion work will significantly reduce the emissions when compared with Marine Diesel Oil (MDO) and/or Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) in terms of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), Sulphur Oxides (SOx) and particulate matter (PM). Therefore, there are clear environmental benefits for using this fuel in the main engines along with a general reduction in particulate emissions. Taking into consideration, the relative differences in fuel prices and the strong requirements for lowering engine emissions the interest for using the LNG gas as fuel in the QG and RG LNG carriers has increased. In addition the ME-GI engine has the flexibility to combust both QG and RG gas compositions. Using LNG as a fuel will not affect engine performance in terms of speed, thermal efficiency or power output, and will maintain the same rating as for the fuel oil burning engine. LNG is destined to become the preferred energy source of the future in many areas of the world, and very few doubt this prediction. Hence, as there will most likely be an overcapacity in LNG production and tanker tonnage, this has generated additional interest in using LNG as a fuel source for ocean-bound vessels as it is expected to be cheaper than other types of fuel. This is especially true for vessels trading in Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECA) as they are required to burn Low-Sulphur fuels when within 200 nautical miles of any port or terminal within such an area. As such, it is felt that the cost savings will be even greater if the LNG fuel price is compared against the price for other types of Low- Sulphur fuels. This paper describes the operating philosophy and scope of works that will be required for the retrofit conversion of the Q-Flex and Q-Max vessels to ME-GI duel fuel two-stroke engines.

TI  - The relationship between the development of global maritime fleets and GHG emission from shipping
AB  - International shipping currently accounts for about 3\% of total global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but would continue to rise as transport capacity expands. If the shipping industry aims at delivering its proportionate contribution to curbing global warming under the Paris agreement, the sector has to, inevitably, promote energy conservation and emission reduction. A rapidly growing oceangoing fleet size and correspondingly rising GHG emissions on a global scale raise an interesting research question: could a certain relationship between the two be characterized as a function so that further emissions can be forecast based on the model? The paper adopts an allometric approach based on biological scaling laws to explore the potential relationship between the fleet size and corresponding GHG emissions from shipping. The results show that both the slowdown of the navigation speed and the current implementation of the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and Energy Efficiency Operation Index (EEOI) are effective on the whole. By employing the model, the development trends of GHG emissions from shipping in the future can be better understood. Through model applications and result analysis, numerical results validate the effectiveness of this method. The paper not only studies the development of GHG emissions from shipping in the past, but aslo evaluates its specific emission quantities in the future which is in line with the GHG emission reduction targets proposed by IMO on the 72nd IMO meeting, which will be helpful for policy decisions on the quota of GHG emissions to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and port administrators.

In this context, this study deals with the design and management of an innovative hybrid thermal-electric propulsion system. The evaluations are referred to the case study of a leisure boat, which is used for passenger transportation in tourist areas. Experimental tests are carried out on single components, with a particular focus on re-calibration of the thermal engine, for its homologation and optimal use in the proposed hybrid architecture. The identification of proper management strategies is performed on the basis of a boat simulation model, which is set up starting from experimental data and characteristics of components. In this regard, an optimization procedure, based on the use of genetic algorithms, is performed in order to set the parameters of onboard energy management strategies and pursue the double objective of extending battery pack cycling life and reducing exhaust emissions. The obtained simulation results highlight the benefits of the proposed architecture showing sensible improvements in comparison with a traditional ICE based configuration. The methodology proposed in this paper enables reliable evaluations and preliminary optimization of energy management strategies, with a drastic reduction in experimentation time and general costs.

TI  - Potential power setups, fuels and hull designs capable of satisfying future EEDI requirements
AB  - Maritime emission regulations set limits for SOx and NOx emissions for health and environmental reasons, and for CO2 through the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), with the general aim of mitigating global warming. EEDI verification is performed at the vessel's design speed and design loads, under calm-water conditions. This, although calm seas are the exception in shipping, and that even with calm-water conditions, ships usually operate at lower speeds than their design speed. A major challenge, if greenhouse gases (GHG) reduction targets are to be met through the EEDI, will be to identify EEDI-compliant solutions that reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions under realistic operational conditions, from lying idle at berth in port to when full power is required in critical situations at sea. In view of all the above, we use the Aframax tanker class to illustrate how such an assessment can be performed, and to display the differences in costs and benefits of options, all of which meet the requirements of the EEDI.

TI  - Techno-economic assessment of alternative marine fuels for inland shipping in Croatia
AB  - Emissions reduction targets are pushing the shipping industry towards cleaner and more energy-efficient solutions. One option proposed is to replace conventional marine fuels with cleaner fuels. This is particularly important for vessels engaged in short-sea shipping and inland waterway transportation because their exhaust gases more negatively affect the local population than long-distance ships do. Hence the aim of this study is to undertake a technical, environmental and economic analysis of alternative fuels to reduce the environmental footprint and lifetime costs of inland waterway transportation. The analysis will focus on Croatia whose existing outdated inland waterway fleet needs to meet the goals of the Low-Carbon Development Strategy of the Republic of Croatia. In the study, a life-cycle analysis and life-cycle cost assessment of different alternative fuels will be performed taking into account the operating profiles and technical characteristics of vessels working in Croatia. The potential effects of a carbon tax are also examined in a case study considering carbon emissions reduction targets in Croatia by 2030. The electrification of ships is highlighted as the most environmentally friendly option for each considered ship, reaching a carbon emission reduction of up to 51\%, while the most cost-effective option varies for each ship.

TI  - Air emission from ship driving force for next generation marine technological and policy change: A review
AB  - The main and auxiliary machineries that move a ship are considered the heart of the ship. Climate change, ozone depletion and global warming that has been recognized as threat of this generation, is linked to ship machineries. This, in a reciprocal manner, is driving the wave of change in policy and technological change for newly built and existing ship. The current challenges being faced are the balance between efficiency as well as low pollution and lack of data for engine performance, and how much emission is being released, and how much impact release to air green house gas (GHG) affluence from machineries, which has health, acidification and structural damage, make implementation of evolving policy difficult. This paper discuss a review of current direction policy technological change emanating from impact of air emission and its inherent consequence of powered shipping, and chemical behavior of green house gases. The paper also present result of evolving mitigation option being explored by marine engine manufacturers for retrofit system of existing ship and new energy technology for newly built. The paper also present data base management requirement that can be effective for require implementation.

TI  - Effect of Load Changes on Hybrid Shipboard Power Systems and Energy Storage as a Potential Solution: A Review
AB  - More electric technologies (METs) play an important role in meeting ever-growing demands for energy efficiency and emission reduction in the maritime transportation sector. As a result, ships with electrical power transmission are becoming popular compared to traditional mechanical power transmission based ships. Hybrid electric propulsion is an intermediate step in this trend where both mechanical and electrical propulsion technologies are combined to get the benefits of both technologies. In this arrangement, not only the propulsion loads but also non-propulsion loads are connected to a common electrical power bus that could lead to serious power quality issues due to disturbances such as large load changes. This paper presents a comprehensive review on energy storage-based solutions that have been proposed to reduce their effects. The important aspects of existing as well as emerging energy storage control techniques and challenges in reducing transient effects in hybrid shipboard power systems with the use of energy storage are discussed in the paper.

TI  - Included in COP21 text or not: Maritime industry commits to reducing emissions
AB  - The shipping industry, though not included in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21), still commits to reducing emissions. International Maritime Organization (IMO) has adopted universal measures that made shipping the first industrial sector to have binding global regime in place to reduce its CO2 emissions. Within the context of IMO's EEDI (Energy Efficiency Design Index), it was agreed that vessels constructed after 2025 will be 30 percent more efficient than those built in 2000. Developments of new propellers, the shape of the hull, antifouling technologies, all contribute to vessels having less emissions per ton kilometer.

TI  - A Comparative Analysis of Optimal Operation Scenarios in Hybrid Emission-Free Ferry Ships
AB  - The utilization of green energy resources for supplying energy to ships in the marine industry has received increasing attention during the last years, where different green resource combinations and control strategies have been used. This article considers a ferry ship supplied by fuel cells (FCs) and batteries as the main sources of ship's power. Based on the designers' and owners' preferences, different scenarios can be considered for managing the operation of the FCs and batteries in all-electric marine power systems. In this article, while considering different constraints of the system, six operating scenarios for the set of FCs and batteries are proposed. Impacts of each proposed scenario on the optimal daily scheduling of FCs and batteries and operation costs of the ship are calculated using a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model. Model predictive control (MPC) is also applied to consider the deviations from hourly forecast demand. Moreover, since the efficiency of FCs varies for different output powers, the impacts of applying a linear model for FCs' efficiency are compared with the proposed nonlinear model and its related deviations from the optimal operation of the ship are investigated. The proposed model is solved by GAMS software using actual system data and the simulation results are discussed. Finally, detailed real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) simulation outcomes and comparative analysis are presented to confirm the adaptation capability of the proposed strategy.

TI  - Facilities for bunkering of liquefied natural gas in ports
AB  - Emission reduction targets are driving a new way of thinking and a range of technological solutions within the shipping and port sectors. So far, four major solutions have been identified for cleaner ship fuels: (i) Marine Gas Oil, (ii) Heavy Fuel Oil + Scrubber, (iii) Liquefied Natural Gas - herein referred to as LNG, and (iv) Methanol. From those alternatives, most experts recognise LNG as the most developed fuel solution, both in the short- and in the medium-term. In 2014, the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) as well as the International Gas Union (IGU) reported a significant growth of terminals for LNG liquefaction and regasification. Moreover, the European Commission, as part of its Clean Power for Transport package, has adopted in 2014 a Directive `on the deployment of alternative fuels, recharging and refuelling infrastructure'. Nevertheless, there are several constraints that need to be addressed yet, more particularly in LNG importing countries in order to meet the future demand of the expected LNG-powered fleet. They include facilities for storage and transhipment of LNG for fuelling berths, barges and ships. This paper provides an overview of the use of LNG for the maritime industry and examines its potential for future growth on the basis of the LNG-powered fleet (current and in order) and planned expansion of LNG bunkering facilities, mainly in European ports. Most data here presented come from a variety of sources including international databases such as IHS Maritime, ports websites, and reports from LNG-related organisations. In addition, the results from past and current EU-funded projects in this field were reviewed and consultations were conducted among representatives from participating ports. Overall, it was found that the LNG powered fleet is expanding slowly and the trend is towards building LNG-propelled vessels for smaller ship sizes and short distances. Although Norway is the newbuilding front runner, other countries, mainly in Europe (e.g. the Netherlands, Denmark, Italy, and Malta), have ordered an important amount of new buildings. Similarly, European ports are expanding considerably their LNG bunkering capacities. Remarkable are the activities conducted by the ports of Spain and Italy with planned expansion for LNG handling and storage facilities beyond 2020. Finally, with regards to regulations, while international standards have been adopted for the construction and operation of LNG powered ships and crew's training, no harmonisation exists yet for LNG facilities in ports. The latter have allowed major ports to undertake independent initiatives to overcome the situation. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Energy efficiency in maritime transport
AB  - The maritime industry has developed immensely in the 21st century. One term that has a great importance and basis in the various aspects of shipping and maritime operations is fuel propulsion. Fuel propulsion is the fundamental rock that any machinery and shipping procedure is set upon nowadays. Despite the improvement in the maritime industry, there is still a major issue to tackle, which is the effect of using non-efficient energy sources (propulsion methods) (non-friendly). Per example, fuel oil is the main energy source for propulsion onboard most of the ships producing harmful emissions such as CO2, SOx and NOx, GHG. This has a direct negative impact on the marine and air environment in different ways. As a result, the IMO exerted great efforts in enhancing the energy efficiency aspect in order to save as much energy as possible from the shipping industry. These efforts appear vividly in the conventions and regulations adopted by the IMO and its amendments in different shapes, such as: The Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI). The Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP). All the ships must have an â€œenergy efficiency management planâ€ that includes steps to insure the optimum energy saving during their voyage, these steps include; regular maintenance and checkups as well as energy efficient habits to be strictly followed by the crewmembers onboard. This paper will formulate the energy efficiency policies and will discuss how to implement these policies and the measures that can be taken to comply with it. Also, the paper will focus more on the technical solutions such as using alternative energy source and introducing new energy efficiency modifications for the ships with the main aim to save energy, reduce the harmful air emission and their effect on the environment.

TI  - Strategy research on ship speed down and exploit high-viscosity fuel
AB  - Ships to save fuel oil are focused in the field of marine energy efficiency and emission reduction. To reduce shipping costs, improve economic operation and increase shipping profits, shipping companies take measures to slow down main engine and burn high-viscosity fuel oil. The main engines, auxiliary engines and boilers of COSCO container vessel loading 10000 containers combust the inferior fuel oil with the high viscosity at 700cst, it is analyzed and calculated in this paper. The results show that, steam consumption to heat the inferior high viscosity fuel oil is increased. When the main engine mean speed is reduced to 50-55RPM, the shipâ€™s actual speed is 11-12kn, navigational speed of container vessel is very low, itâ€™s save fuel oil is very significant, fuel-efficient reaches to limit.

TI  - Alternative Marine Fuel Research Advances and Future Trends: A Bibliometric Knowledge Mapping Approach
AB  - While the marine sector contributes significantly to the global economy, its environmental impact is a cause for apprehension due to growing concerns about ship emissions. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set decarbonization strategies consistent with sustainable development goals. The impending legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from maritime shipping by at least half by 2050 and to zero by the end of the century. A growing body of research has focused on alternative marine fuel selection; hence, this bibliometric review is timely. We assess the global scientific research on alternative marine fuel for knowledge mapping based on the articles available on the Scopus database since 1973. A total of 749 publications associated with alternative marine fuel has been subjected to a range of bibliometric analyses to explore this research field quantitatively and qualitatively. The study utilized the R-studio bibliometrics package and VOSviewer bibliometric tools to generate the results. The field of study has a growth rate of 7.05\%, having a significant contribution to knowledge from the USA, the United Kingdom, India, and China. Recent trends indicate that researchers are increasingly focused on alternative fuel oil choices. By analyzing commonly used keywords, it was possible to trace a multi-criteria decision analysis process that might be utilized to construct decision support systems for alternative maritime fuel selection. According to relevant articles, the research community has concentrated on the possibility of alternative fuels being utilized in place of traditional marine fuels to reduce emissions from the shipping sector from an environmental, technological, and economic standpoint. The current study offers an updated and comprehensive overview of research trends on alternative marine fuels. Researchers interested in data mapping work in this area can begin with this endeavor.

TI  - A hybrid marine vessel - Supplemented by a thermoelectric generator (TEG) power system - As a case study for reducing emissions and improving diesel engine efficiency
AB  - A hallmark of the maritime transportation industry is efficiency. Estimates are that 90% of cross border world trade is accomplished by means of waterways while consuming only 7% of the energy for the total transportation sector. Nonetheless, marine diesel engines, which serve as power plants for most commercial, ocean going vessels, have long been identified as a major source of air pollution for port cities and coastal areas. Accordingly, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (the MARPOL Treaty) has significant ramifications for the maritime industry, as exemplified by the stringent 2016 standard to lower emissions. Such realities, along with the rising cost of non-renewable petroleum fuels, necessitate the recovery of the wasted heat onboard marine vessels. Thermoelectric materials are an enabling technology that allows the recapture of this wasted energy from heat sources, such as exhaust and coolant systems, which account for nearly 50% of the total combustion energy. If a fraction of the marine diesel's wasted energy could be harnessed and stored with high power density batteries, an electric drive system could be utilized to transport ships quietly and cleanly into and out of congested ports and high population centers. Overall, a dramatic reduction of the maritime industry's carbon footprint could be realized, as a modest 10% increase in engine efficiency translates into a savings of approximately 180,000 barrels of fuel per day on a world-wide basis. Solid state thermoelectric materials, when exposed to a thermal gradient, generate an electric potential according to the Seebeck effect. While the automobile industry has taken a lead in commercializing thermoelectric generators (TEG) as early as 2013, it is the marine industry that may well be the greater beneficiary of this technology. Economies of scale, the ability to generate a higher thermal gradient, and fewer weight and volume constraints, all suggest a promising feasibility for marine applications. The successful development of a hybrid thermoelectric vessel (green ship) at Maine Maritime Academy is a promising first step in helping realize the theme of this year's General Assembly of the International Association of Maritime Universities (IAMU): Green Ships, Eco Shipping, and Clean Seas.

TI  - WÃ¤rtsilÌˆ dual-fuel now in 100 LNG carriers
AB  - WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤'s dual-fuel engines are now in 100 LNG carrier vessels, following the delivery of one such ship from a South Korean shipyard. The 100 LNG carriers represent â‰ˆ 25% of the current global fleet. WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤'s dual-fuel technology was first launched in the early 1990s for use in land-based power plant applications. The first marine installation of the 5ODF engine came a decade later. The technology allows the engine to be operated on either natural gas, light fuel oil, or heavy fuel oil, and switching between fuels can take place seamlessly during operation, without loss of power or speed, which ensures safety and continuous installation operability. The engine is designed to have the same output regardless of the fuel used.

TI  - Reduction of Resistance, Fuel Consumption and GHG Emission of a Small Fishing Vessel by Adding a Bulbous Bow
AB  - Protection of marine environment and reduction of GHG emissions are currently imperative criterion for ship design. For ships in service, including fishing vessels powered by internal combustion engines, options of retrofitting are sought to reduce their hydrodynamic resistance and fuel consumption. One such possibility is the addition of a simple-shape bulbous bow, which can be installed at low cost to upgrade a fishing vessel. We present an analysis of the effect that the bulbous bow has on fishing vessel resistance across the whole range of speeds at which the entire work cycle of the vessel is carried out. The resistance was calculated using a calculation of fluid dynamics (CFD) method for the actual size of the vessel. We show that it is possible to develop such a bulbous bow for which the resistance of fishing vessel with a bulbous bow is going to be lower than that of an unmodified shape. For the modified shape of the fishing vessel, fuel consumption, amount and composition of exhaust gases were calculated and the obtained results were compared with the parameters of the vessel without modification. The tests carried out and the obtained calculation results indicate that a significant reduction of fuel consumption and GHG emissions may be obtained for the existing old fishing vessels at low anticipated modernization costs.

TI  - Estimation of shipping emissions based on real-time data with different methods: A case study of an oceangoing container ship
AB  - The environmental consequences of ship-based greenhouse emissions have been increasingly significant as a result of the rise in the share of maritime transportation in international trade. Transnational organizations such as the European Union and the International Maritime Organization monitor these emissions and have come to limit some gas emissions such as SOx, NOx, PM, and CO2. These limiting measures are all needed and welcome. However, we need more accurate data to inform and implement even more concrete policies. This study contributes to such efforts by providing calculations of the emissions of NOx, NMVOC, PM, SOx, CO, and CO2 from an oceangoing container ship during its 37-day voyage in 2019. The use of a real case scenario differentiates this study from others. We employed two conventionally used methods to make the estimations. One is the fuel-based approach (top-down) and the other is the activity-based approach (bottom-up). While there is some discrepancy of results produced by the two methods, there is also consistency in terms of percentages regarding which gas is emitted most and when. The results indicate that by taking appropriate measures such as reducing fuel consumption, and using low-sulfur fuel, as well as optimizing port traffic, the environmental damage of maritime transportation could be reduced.

TI  - Ship energy management system development and experimental evaluation utilizing marine loading cycles based on machine learning techniques
AB  - In order to develop energy management systems for hybrid ship propulsion plants that are truly optimal and robust, it is important that the test conditions in experimental facilities are as close as possible to real world applications. In this context, a framework for the design and experimental evaluation of power-split control systems for ship propulsion is proposed. Using machine learning, data from ship operation are processed and 20 loading patterns are recognized; representative templates are extracted to be used as marine loading cycles in the energy management system development and testing. A ship propulsion model with wave disturbance is utilized to simulate realistic loading scenarios on the experimental facility. A predictive energy management system is presented, that controls the diesel engine and the electric motor/generator based on a strategy that defines the trade-off between fuel consumption and NOx emissions minimization. In addition the propeller load characteristics that are estimated and a speed predictor are utilized to aid the optimization within the 10 s prediction time window. A parametric simulation study is performed for the trade-off evaluation between fuel consumption and NOx emissions reduction potential of the control scheme. Finally, utilizing an extracted loading cycle, the energy management system is experimentally implemented and tested in real-time operation, where it has to cope with environmental disturbance rejection and follow the desired speed profile while performing the power-split control in respect to the fuel to NOx weighting strategy. Based on the experimental results in a hybrid dieselâ€“electric marine powertrain with a 260 kW diesel engine and a 90 kW electric machine, fuel consumption and NOx emissions reduction by 6% and 8.5% respectively, were achieved over the tested profile. In this framework, the capabilities of the energy management system in realistic operation conditions can be exploited and evaluated. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Lifecycle Environmental Benefits with a Hybrid Electric Propulsion System Using a Control Algorithm for Fishing Boats in Korea
AB  - In Korea, fishing boats account for 65,452 out of 71,174 coastal ships, and aging ships are a leading cause of environmental problems and economic loss. To solve this problem, the government has enacted a policy to promote the development and distribution of environmental vessels. Electric propulsion systems and hybrid systems are suggested as alternatives. However, to study whether this hybrid system is environmentally friendly, a system for measuring the performance of conventional diesel-powered ships was developed and measured. A case study applying the battery hybrid system was analyzed through a Matlab/Simulink simulation, and the effect of reducing the carbon dioxide emissions by 7.6\% was verified. In addition, comparing with a case where the load-sharing optimal control was introduced, we proved that the carbon dioxide reduction with the controller was 10.7\%. By applying the results of this study to various countries with different fuel production processes through the LCA technique, it was confirmed that the battery hybrid system is eco-friendly from the energy production stage, rather than unconditionally, according to the national power production method. Additional research is needed to reflect the aging trend of the entire fleet and to create a detailed category classification through future research.

TI  - Method for reduction of the NOX emissions in marine auxiliary diesel engine using the fuel mixtures containing biodiesel using HCCI combustion
AB  - The marine auxiliary diesel engines installed in the large transoceanic ships are used in order to generate the electricity but at the same time these engines are able to produce a significant amount of the harmful exhaust gas emissions. Therefore the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) concluded an agreement, which has to control generating of gaseous emissions in maritime transport. From this reason started to be used some of the alternative fuels in this branch. There was performed a study, which investigated emissions of the auxiliary marine diesel engine during application of the experimental fuels. The different testing fuels were created using the ratios 0%, 50%, 80% and 100% between the biodiesel and the ULSDF (Ultra Low Sulphur Diesel Fuel). The experimental measurements were performed at the different engine loading levels and various engine speeds in order to investigate an influence of the mixed fuels on the engine operational characteristics.

TI  - Parallel Control for Hybrid Propulsion of Multifunction Ships
AB  - Multifunction ships, naval vessels in particular, need to reduce fuel consumption while maintaining manoeuvrability. Hybrid propulsion that runs a main diesel engine and electric drive in parallel can achieve this. However, a parallel control strategy needs to be developed. In this paper, we use a simulation model of a hybrid propulsion system to investigate two parallel control strategies for diesel mechanical and electrical propulsion on multifunction ships. For the case study frigate, parallel control can increase the ship top speed with 3 kts when using two 4 MW electric drives and two 10 MW main diesel engines, compared with the same baseline hybrid propulsion without parallel control. The diesel engine speed control with electric drive torque control strategy increases ship acceleration rate with 17\% and reduces average engine thermal loading with 150 K. Moreover, the electric drive speed control with diesel engine torque control strategy can improve acceleration rate by 40\%, while eliminating thermal loading fluctuation due to heavy seas, and also reducing engine average thermal loading with 150 K. Future combination of the proposed electric drive speed control strategy with an adaptive pitch control and optimal power split strategy can potentially further increase hybrid propulsion plant performance.

TI  - Ship Performance Monitoring and Analysis to Improve Fuel Efficiency
AB  - A pilot project was launched to monitor vessel performance and to explore ways to reduce fuel consumption. A prototype Vessel Performance Monitoring and Analysis System (VPMAS) was used to collect information over a three week period. The project objective was to collect needed data, conduct preliminary analysis to establish trends, explore key performance indicators (KPI) to establish baseline, and explore data products for performance management. Performance management includes improving vessel performance and supporting efficient operation to reduce fuel consumption. For the pilot project, only a subset of vessel performance data was collected. Current key performance indicators (KPIs) include fuel consumption per trip, fuel consumption per distance travelled, fuel consumption per displacement distance and fuel consumption per payload distance. The dataset will expand in the future and will include the effect of environmental conditions. Preliminary analysis includes comparing the normal route for calm sea states and irregular routes taken probably to avoid heavy sea states; assessing the maneuvers in and out of harbors, computing key performance indicators, assessing the data trends and general statistics, and identifying data products to support performance management. Initial results show that automatic fuel measurement was in good agreement with manual tank sounding. A voyage on an irregular route consumed almost twice the amount of fuel consumed in a normal route. Fuel consumption would be reduced if constant speed is used in open water and if deviations from the desired routes could be minimized, for example, through optimized autopilot.

TI  - Performance Analysis of Ship Exhaust Gas Temperature Differential Power Generation
AB  - In addition to the use of waste heat from the vessel's exhaust gas to save energy onboard, reduce the carbon emissions of the ship, and combine the characteristics of ship waste heat, mathematical modeling and testing of ship waste heat temperature difference power generation were carried out in this study. Finally, an experimental platform for temperature differential power generation was established to assess the impact of influencing agents on the efficiency of temperature differential power generation. The results show that the effect of different thermally conductive greases on the efficiency of temperature differential power generation tablets is basically the same. In addition, the rate of flow of cooling water, the cooling plate area, and the heat source temperature have more significant effects on the open-circuit voltage and maximum output power. The results show that the maximum power output growth rate increases with increasing cooling water flow, reaching 8.26\% at 4 L/min. Likewise, increasing the heat source temperature enhances the maximum output power growth rate by 15.25\% at 220 degrees C. Conversely, the maximum output power of the temperature difference power generation device decreases as the cooling plate area increases, and the maximum output power reduction rate is 15.25\% when the cooling plate area is 80 x 200 mm(2) compared to the case of using a cooling plate area of 80 x 80 mm(2). Moreover, the maximum output power of the temperature differential power generation device reaches 13.6 W under optimal conditions. Assuming that the temperature difference power generation plate is evenly distributed on the tailpipe of the 6260ZCD marine booster diesel engine, it could save approximately 5.44 kW center dot h electric power per hour and achieve a reduction in CO2 emissions of 0.3435 kg per hour.

TI  - A review of fuel cell systems for maritime applications
AB  - Progressing limits on pollutant emissions oblige ship owners to reduce the environmental impact of their operations. Fuel cells may provide a suitable solution, since they are fuel efficient while they emit few hazardous compounds. Various choices can be made with regard to the type of fuel cell system and logistic fuel, and it is unclear which have the best prospects for maritime application. An overview of fuel cell types and fuel processing equipment is presented, and maritime fuel cell application is reviewed with regard to efficiency, gravimetric and volumetric density, dynamic behaviour, environmental impact, safety and economics. It is shown that low temperature fuel cells using liquefied hydrogen provide a compact solution for ships with a refuelling interval up to a tens of hours, but may result in total system sizes up to five times larger than high temperature fuel cells and more energy dense fuels for vessels with longer mission requirements. The expanding infrastructure of liquefied natural gas and development state of natural gas-fuelled fuel cell systems can facilitate the introduction of gaseous fuels and fuel cells on ships. Fuel cell combined cycles, hybridisation with auxiliary electricity storage systems and redundancy improvements are identified as topics for further study. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The thermodynamic characteristics of a combined cycle applied with a topping cycle such as a trilateral cycle at relatively high temperatures and a bottoming cycle such as an organic Rankine cycle at relatively low temperatures have been theoretically investigated. This is an electric generation system used to recover the waste heat of the exhaust gas from a diesel engine used for the propulsion of a large ship. As a result, when the boundary temperature between the topping and the bottoming cycles increased, the system efficiencies of energy and exergy were simultaneously maximized because the total exergy destruction rate (Â£Ed) and exergy loss (Â£) decreased, respectively. In the case of a marine diesel engine, the waste heat recovery electric generation system can be utilized for additional propulsion power, and the propulsion efficiency was found to be improved by an average of 9.17 % according to the engine load variation, as compared to the case with only the base engine. In this ease, the specific fuel consumption and specific C02 emission of the diesel engine were reduced by an average of 8.4% and 8.37%, respectively.

TI  - Study on Applicability of Energy-Saving Devices to Hydrogen Fuel Cell-Powered Ships
AB  - The decarbonisation of waterborne transport is arguably the biggest challenge faced by the maritime industry presently. By 2050, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the shipping industry by 50\% compared to 2008, with a vision to phase out fossil fuels by the end of the century as a matter of urgency. To meet such targets, action must be taken immediately to address the barriers to adopt the various clean shipping options currently at different technological maturity levels. Green hydrogen as an alternative fuel presents an attractive solution to meet future targets from international bodies and is seen as a viable contributor within a future clean shipping vision. The cost of hydrogen fuel-in the short-term at least-is higher compared to conventional fuel; therefore, energy-saving devices (ESDs) for ships are more important than ever, as implementation of rules and regulations restrict the use of fossil fuels while promoting zero-emission technology. However, existing and emerging ESDs in standalone/combination for traditional fossil fuel driven vessels have not been researched to assess their compatibility for hydrogen-powered ships, which present new challenges and considerations within their design and operation. Therefore, this review aims to bridge that gap by firstly identifying the new challenges that a hydrogen-powered propulsion system brings forth and then reviewing the quantitative energy saving capability and qualitive additional benefits of individual existing and emerging ESDs in standalone and combination, with recommendations for the most applicable ESD combinations with hydrogen-powered waterborne transport presented to maximise energy saving and minimise the negative impact on the propulsion system components. In summary, the most compatible combination ESDs for hydrogen will depend largely on factors such as vessel types, routes, propulsion, operation, etc. However, the mitigation of load fluctuations commonly encountered during a vessels operation was viewed to be a primary area of interest as it can have a negative impact on hydrogen propulsion system components such as the fuel cell; therefore, the ESD combination that can maximise energy savings as well as minimise the fluctuating loads experienced would be viewed as the most compatible with hydrogen-powered waterborne transport.

TI  - A Procedure for Predicting and Controlling the Ship Fuel Consumption: Its Implementation and Test
AB  - In light of the International Maritime Organization guidelines, the new Regulation of the European Union urges shipping companies to set up a system for monitoring, reporting and verification of CO2 emissions based on ship fuel consumption. However, in nowadays market, there is a lack of techniques for fuel consumption monitoring that can be adopted in a real environment. The proposed procedure overcomes the use of Speed-Power curves, which are commonly utilized in the Naval Architecture, by means of a multiple linear regression model that exploits the navigation information usually available in modern ships. This procedure can be used both to alert technical management of a shipping company for anomalous fuel consumption and to quantify the fuel consumption reduction connected with any specific policy adopted to improve energy efficiency. Therefore, this can be particularly profitable for shipping companies and operators in order to claim for carbon credits. The proposed approach is currently implemented by the Energy Saving Technical Department of the Grimaldi Group on a Ro-Ro Pax ship. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Regulations towards Cryogenic Carbon Capture Implementation on the Marine Transport
AB  - Considering that the maritime industry emits roughly 3% of the global emissions within the outlook to increase in-between 50 and 250 percent by 2050 the forecast of the growth highlights the need to introduce measures against the negative maritime industry impact on the environment in order to comply with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) goal to minimize the total greenhouse gas emission generation at least 50% by 2050 towards Paris climate agreement policy. According to the established standard from the 01st of January 2023 all ships will be required to present their annual operational carbon intensity indicator (CII) and CII rating. The CII rating will be related to the total volume of cargo carried per distance and will classify vessels into categories of efficiency: A, B, C, E, D where category A will represent the most efficient class of vessels. The low class vessels accordingly will be encouraged by authorities to introduce action measures to improve cargo handling efficiency levels therefore the introduced grading will likewise force shipowners to revise technological availability to retrofit vessels into more efficient. LNG fuel serves as a transition fuel due to its beneficial properties for decarbonization and cryogenic carbon capture technologies implementation in marine transport.

TI  - Emission and fuel reduction for offshore support vessels through hybrid technology
AB  - Traditionally offshore support vessels have been designed to ensure that they can perform their duties at nearly any sea state. This has been achieved through multiple engines and advanced dynamic positioning systems. This in combination with high safety standards set by the oil companies has resulted in a general operational pattern with vessels running multiple engines at low to medium loads to be prepared for unexpected incidents to happen at any time. At medium to high power the combustion engine produces each kWh with the lowest fuel consumption and the lowest emissions. When engines operate at low power, fuel consumption per kWh produced increases. For the cost of the operation, this increase in specific fuel consumption at lower loads makes a small impact compared to the total cost of the operation, while for emissions low loads implies that emissions of exhaust gases such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and aerosols such as black carbon (BC) increases rapidly due to less favorable combustion conditions. This study investigates potential emission and fuel consumption reductions which can be achieved by introduction of hybrid technologies including their climate mitigation potential. In this context hybrid means engines of different sizes, battery storage of energy to take peak power requirements, and power management systems with a more balanced focus on reducing emissions and energy consumption while maintaining a high safety standard. Our results indicate that hybrid technologies reduce both emissions and fuel consumption and that the climate impact of the emission reduction is much larger than the impact due to the reduction in fuel consumption alone.

TI  - Knowledge Base Construction of Ship Energy Efficiency Accounting for Various Environmental Factors Based on Big Data Analysis
AB  - Nowadays, energy saving and emission reduction have aroused widespread concern in the maritime industry. Energy efficiency optimization is one of the effective ways to save energy and reduce emissions. Ship energy efficiency is synthetically influenced by multiple factors including environmental and operational profile. The randomness of these factors results in very complex interrelation among the environment and ship engine speed as well as ship energy efficiency. It is difficult for the semi-empirical or theoretical modeling methods to describe such interrelation accurately. The rapid development of big data analysis makes it possible to obtain the association rules of various environmental factors and ship energy efficiency as well as engine speed. In this paper, big data analyses in terms of Parallel Distributed K-Means Clustering (PDKC) algorithm and Parallel Frequent Pattern Mining (PFPM) algorithm are adopted to achieve the clustering analysis of ship energy efficiency related data, and to obtain the interrelation among ship energy efficiency and environmental factors as well as engine speed. On this basis, the knowledge base of ship energy efficiency accounting for various environmental factors is established. The constructed knowledge base can be used for exploring optimization methods of ship energy efficiency, promoting decision-making system development and contributing to energy saving and emission reduction of ships.

TI  - Advanced operational measure for reducing fuel consumption onboard ships
AB  - Environmental issues and targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have reinforced attempts to increase energy efficiency for all stakeholders, including the shipping industry. International maritime organization (IMO) has prescribed operational and design measures to develop energy efficiency and decrease ship emissions, and one of the effective operational measures is trim optimization, which is a feasible measure because it does not necessitate ship structural modification or engine advancement, but it can reduce the ship resistance and decrease fuel consumption. The study of trim optimization can be implemented by conducting experimental tests, but it is a difficult, expensive method and consumed more time. Therefore, the present paper proposes a numerical method to predict the optimum trim which achieves the minimum ship resistance and lower fuel consumption. The current paper investigated two types of ships as a case study, bulk carrier, and container ship. The optimization process has studied several trim conditions, ship drafts, and speeds. The results showed that positive trim (trim by bow) have an increasing effect on fuel consumption, while the negative trim (trim by stern) have a decreasing effect on fuel consumption. Fuel-saving based on using optimum trim at each speed is a significant quantity to be benefited as it would reduce the operating costs and increase the energy efficiency.

TI  - Filtration systems for greener vessels
AB  - Several vessel owners and managers are considering alternative fuels, such as biodiesel and innovative crankcase systems, to comply with environmental regulations. The use of alternative fuels and innovative crankcase systems are also helping vessel owners and managers, to overcome the challenges of increased operating costs. A nee generation of fuel filtration systems have been developed specifically for these applications. The technology enables vessel operators in reducing the environmental impact of marine diesels, while maintaining optimum performance levels. It has been observed that filtering biofuels derived from vegetable oils or biomass offer an effective carbon neutral alternative to conventional diesel. Biofuels can also have a significant adverse effect on the cold filter plugging point (CFPP) of fuel, leading to reduced engine performance and complete breakdown.

TI  - Performance Monitoring Insight using Predictive Analytics: A Step towards IMO's GHG Emission Goals 2030
AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) regulates the GHG Emissions from ships through operational and technical measures. According to the survey, thousands of owners will be affected which may initially bring inflation in marine transportation economics. Many people believe that installing Energy Saving Devices could help the ships perform. On the contrary, many others are limiting the engine power, fuel consumption and emissions from highly complex network of sensors as well. The present study could benefit the ship owners who would wish to adapt a less complex methodology using Machine Learning which utilizes ship performance database of several voyages in order to do prediction of Fuel oil consumption in derated power in collaborating with the forecasted weather data. The study proposes a method to estimate the Power consumption of ships by predicting the ship operational performance at various environmental conditions, and to provide Engine Derating measures to improve the EEXI. An oil tanker is selected as the candidate vessel and a predictive model is developed with the vessel's Noon Report data. The predictive variables considered are engine brake power, engine RPM, draft, trim, speed over ground, speed through water and environmental factors. The machine learning model is trained over the analysed data and relations between parameters are established. Data is categorized into test and train datasets and a comparative analysis between combination of various multiple regression models, classification models and feature engineered datasets was conducted. The effectiveness of the models is measured based on a number of key performance indicators. The developed model can predict the power consumption of the vessel with excess of 95\% accuracy. Moreover, a preliminary version of mobile application (speed log app) is also developed to digitally enter the noon data on board the ship.

TI  - Resizing study of main and auxiliary engines of the container vessels and their contribution to the reduction of fuel consumption and GHG
AB  - The maritime industry has great potential for improving energy efficiency in both new builds and existing ships. It is, therefore, necessary to identify the areas where improvements can be made to reduce fuel consumption, and influence to the shipowners, shipyards and designers of ships on the need to implement these improvements in energetic efficiency and to achieve a reduction of between 25% and 75% of CO2 emissions as IMO report 2009 provides, making ships even more environmentally friendly. The study was conducted focusing on one type of ship such as containership, compiling a database of these ships built from 2000 to 2014. The 3618 ships comprising the study were taken from the database of Lloyd's Register of Shipping. With all the technical data on each of the ships, we proceeded to relate the main and auxiliary power, with the operating speed of the vessel, its displacement and GT, by size, age and generation ships. All the above comparisons were made according to ship sizes, graphically and analytically in which interesting conclusions could be drawn in the relevant dimensioning of the main and auxiliary engines, as well as the operation of the ship. Because of the current crisis some owners have already begun to change their size criteria of propulsion and auxiliary engines of these vessels, their management and operation as well as their speed. Another significant finding was the identification of some shipyards that build their ships with an oversize and exaggerated power of the main and auxiliary engines, regardless of the effect on increasing fuel consumption and impact on the environment. Finally, we have performed a comparative study of EEOI of these vessels by size and age to determine the environmental signature and their evolution. All this leads us to determine a set of measures to be applied, for example, power reduction or derating, etc. on existing ships and applied to new designs, thus reducing the propulsion and auxiliary power of these ships and collaborating to reduce greenhouse gases.

TI  - Economic and environmental trade-offs in water transportation
AB  - In recent years slow steaming has resurfaced as a fuel saving measure allowing ship owners to significantly cut operational costs. Reduced fuel consumption leads to lower levels of greenhouse gases and pollutant emissions. Port authorities have considered offering incentives to ship operators that significantly reduce sailing speedin the port proximity, as a means to improve local air quality.This chapter conducts a literature review on emissions modelling methodologies for maritime transport and develops a framework that allows the estimation of pollutant emissions under different sailing scenarios. The chapter presents existing regulations and port initiatives thataim to reduce maritime emissions. The merits of localise slow steaming near the calling port for various case studies including different ship size, trip distance, sailingspeed and fuel policies in place are examined. An activity based methodology is used to estimate fuel consumption and emissions savings during lower sailing speed operation for machinery on-board.Fuel price and the value of timelost govern the extent to which slow steaming and local speed reductions can be effective. The economic and environmental trade-offs occurring at different sailing speeds are discussed from the perspective of both the ship operator and the port authority considering the implications of regulatory policies such as the expansion of Emission Control Areas (ECA). The chapter concludes with a set of guidelines to port authorities on designing attractive speed reduction programmes, and recommendations to shipping companies on improving fuel efficiency across their schedule when such programmes are available.

TI  - Comprehensive Study of a Hybrid Electric Ship for Optimum Onboard Fuel Consumption
AB  - With significant inroads being made in the electrification of land-based transport in recent years, there is an increased impetus on maritime transport as well for navigating towards cleaner fuels and reducing their emissions. However, the griddistant nature of marine vessels poses several challenges for their electrification not faced by their overland counterparts. This paper addresses some of these issues and outlines the role of power electronics in tackling them through onboard/onshore converters. Moreover, a hybrid energy interface feeding the ship's propulsion system and various loads is modeled and analyzed in a simulated environment wherein an intelligent control strategy is employed to optimize the use of onboard energy resources. Finally, some future trends are highlighted in the development of electric ships for making water transport emission-free. Â© 2022 IEEE.

TI  - Installation and characteristics of urea-selective catalytic reduction systems for nitrogen oxide reduction in marine diesel engine
AB  - Since 1 January 2016, the International Maritime Organization Tier III regulations concerning nitrogen oxides took effect. International Maritime Organization Tier III targets new ships weighing over 400 ton engaged in international sailing, especially those entering and leaving emission control areas. The number of emission control areas, including sulfur emission control areas, is forecasted to increase in Japanese seas and elsewhere; thus, all new ships intended for international sailing purposes must consider appropriate responses to these regulations. Currently, urea-selective catalytic reduction systems are frequently used to satisfy International Maritime Organization Tier III regulations in marine diesel engines, but these decrease ship engine performance due to increased engine exhaust gas pressure. Thus, following a study by Ryu et al., this research compares engine exhaust gas pressures at different engine loads (25\%, 30\%, 35\%, 40\%, 45\%, and 50\%) with the application of a thinner metal catalyst to a selective catalytic reduction reactor; metal catalyst thickness was reduced by 30\% or more from the original sheet thickness of 0.1 t. Furthermore, 40\% urea was injected into the exhaust gas line to conduct a comparative analysis of nitrogen oxide reduction. By changing the metal catalyst's sheet thickness, nitrogen oxide was reduced by more than 80\%, while the engine exhaust gas pressure was lowered by approximately 13\%-28\%.

TI  - Design and Simulation of Ammonia-Fueled SOFC-ICE Hybrid Power System for Ship Application
AB  - Increasingly stringent emission limits and carbon reduction needs of the shipping industry have forced shipowners and builders to look for alternative fuels and related power technology. Using ammonia to fuel solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems is one of the most efficient and environment-friendly technology options for the marine power. Considering the efficient utilization of exhaust gas and the effective integration of hybrid system, the combination of SOFC and other power technologies can achieve higher efficiency. In view of the current promotion of low-carbon/zero carbon fuel in the maritime industry and the integration of efficient and stable complementary SOFC and internal combustion engine (ICE) hybrid, it will be applied on ships in the future. Therefore, this paper designed an ammonia-fueled SOFC-ICE hybrid system for all-electric ship application. Based on MATLAB/SIMULINL, the steady-state electrochemical model of SOFC and the look-up table model of ICE about load were established. It is found that the electric efficiency of the ammonia ICE can reach about 30%. Based on a typical oil tanker, the ammonia-fueled SOFC-ICE hybrid power system achieves an electrical efficiency of 46.6% when the installed power density of the ammonia-fueled SOFC is 0.3 W/cm2 and the SOFC/ICE power ratio is 70-30.

TI  - Preliminary design of a fuel cell/battery hybrid powertrain for a heavy-duty yard truck for port logistics
AB  - The maritime transport and the port-logistic industry are key drivers of economic growth, although, they represent major contributors to climate change. In particular, maritime port facilities are typically located near cities or residential areas, thus having a significant direct environmental impact, in terms of air and water quality, as well as noise. The majority of the pollutant emissions in ports comes from cargo ships, and from all the related ports activities carried out by road vehicles. Therefore, a progressive reduction of the use of fossil fuels as a primary energy source for these vehicles and the promotion of cleaner powertrain alternatives is in order. The present study deals with the design of a new propulsion system for a heavy-duty vehicle for port applications. Specifically, this work aims at laying the foundations for the development of a benchmark industrial cargo-handling hydrogen-fueled vehicle to be used in real port operations. To this purpose, an on-field measurement campaign has been conducted to analyze the duty cycle of a commercial Diesel-engine yard truck currently used for terminal ports operations. The vehicle dynamics has been numerically modeled and validated against the acquired data, and the energy and power requirements for a plug-in fuel cell/battery hybrid powertrain replacing the Diesel powertrain on the same vehicle have been evaluated. Finally, a preliminary design of the new powertrain and a rule-based energy management strategy have been proposed, and the electric energy and hydrogen consumptions required to achieve the target driving range for roll-on and roll-off operations have been estimated. The results are promising, showing that the hybrid electric vehicle is capable of achieving excellent energy performances, by means of an efficient use of the fuel cell. An overall amount of roughly 12 kg of hydrogen is estimated to be required to accomplish the most demanding port operation, and meet the target of 6 h of continuous operation. Also, the vehicle powertrain ensures an adequate all-electric range, which is between approximately 1 and 2 h depending on the specific port operation. Potentially, the hydrogen-fueled yard truck is expected to lead to several benefits, such as local zero emissions, powertrain noise elimination, reduction of the vehicle maintenance costs, improving of the energy management, and increasing of operational efficiency.

TI  - Analysis of Pollutant Emission Characteristics of Marine Diesel Engine Using Chemical Kinetics under the Background of Energy Shortage
AB  - The study aims to reduce the environmental pollutants produced in the ship transportation in the environment of energy shortage, and realize the comprehensive development of energy saving and emission reduction. Based on the theoretical basis of chemical kinetics, a new type of NOx emission generation model of marine diesel engine was proposed according to the traditional HB model. Second, the combustion chemical kinetics of sulfide was described, on which the sulfide generation and emission model of marine diesel engine was proposed. Third, the characteristics of NO, N2O and SO2 were analyzed according to the emission model of NOx and sulfide generation in marine diesel engine. The results showed that when the crankshaft angle was 230Â° and 250Â°CA, the content of NO and N2O in the exhaust pipe of diesel engine had an obvious peak. The content of NO and N2O in the cylinder and exhaust pipe of diesel engine increased at the beginning. As the crankshaft angle increased, the content of both decreased gradually, and the trend of change in the cylinder was slower than that in the exhaust pipe. The SO2 content in the diesel cylinder kept stable after a small increase until it disappeared. The SO2 content in the exhaust pipe first increased and then decreased. When the crankshaft angle was 230Â°CA, the SO2 content in the exhaust pipe of the diesel engine had an obvious peak. The emission characteristics of nitrogen oxide and sulfide were consistent with the correct change trend, which conformed to the theoretical mechanism. In a word, the study provides a practical basis for energy conservation and emission reduction, development of low-carbon economy, and efficient use of energy.

TI  - A review on regulations, current status, effects and reduction strategies of emissions for marine diesel engines
AB  - Marine diesel engines, which provide main power source for ships, mainly contribute to air pollution in ports and coastal areas. Thus there is an increasing demand on tightening the emission standards for marine diesel engines, which necessitates the research on various emission reduction strategies. This review covers emission regulations and emission factors (EFs), environmental effects and available emission reduction solutions for marine diesel engines. Not only the establishment of the emission control areas (ECAs) in the regulations but also many experiments show high concerns about the sulfur limits in fuels, sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. Research results reveal that NOx emissions from marine diesel engines account for 50% of total NOx in harbors and coastal regions. Sulfur content in fuel oil is an important parameter index that determines the development direction of emission control technologies. Despites some issues, biodiesel, methanol and liquefied nature gas (LNG) play their important roles in reducing emissions as well as in replacing fossil energy, being promising fuels for marine diesel engines. Fuel-water emulsion (FWE) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) are effective treatment option for NOx emissions control. Common rail fuel injection is an effective fuel injection strategy to achieve simultaneous reductions in particulate matter (PM) and NOx. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and wet scrubbing are the most mature and effective exhaust aftertreatment methods for marine diesel engines, which show 90% De-NOx efficiency and 95% De-SOx efficiency. It can be concluded that the integrated multi-pollutant treatment for ship emissions holds great promise. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Speed models for energy-efficient maritime transportation: A taxonomy and survey
AB  - International shipping accounts for 2.7% of worldwide CO2 emissions, and measures to curb future emissions growth are sought with a high sense of urgency. With the increased quest for greener shipping, reducing the speed of ships has obtained an increased role as one of the measures to be applied toward that end. Already speed has been important for economic reasons, as it is a key determinant of fuel cost, a significant component of the operating cost of ships. Moreover, speed is an important parameter of the overall logistical operation of a shipping company and of the overall supply chain and may directly or indirectly impact fleet size, ship size, cargo inventory costs and shippers' balance sheets. Changes in ship speed may also induce modal shifts, if cargo can choose other modes because they are faster. However, as emissions are directly proportional to fuel consumed, speed is also very much connected with the environmental dimension of shipping. So when shipping markets are in a depressed state and " slow-steaming" is the prevalent practice for economic reasons, an important side benefit is reduced emissions. In fact there are many indications that this practice, very much applied these days, will be the norm in the future. This paper presents a survey of speed models in maritime transportation, that is, models in which speed is one of the decision variables. A taxonomy of such models is also presented, according to a set of parameters. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Electric propulsion in the Dutch inland shipping sector
AB  - Maritime industries are continuously in search of new opportunities to improve their environmental impact by eliminating air polluting and climate affecting emissions. Ships that can sail without producing any such local pollutants are referred to as zero-emission ships. In pursuit of enabling the breakthrough of such vessels smart combinations of fuel-cells, batteries and electric propulsion systems are needed to secure acceptable payloads, range and turn-around times. A Dutch FELMAR-consortium, consisting of Nedstack, MARIN, Damen Shipyards Group, Future Proof Shipping, Marine Service Noord and Holland Ship Electric, has been awarded a grant for the development of a new generation of fuel cell electric energy system for zero-emission ships. It has been revealed that electric and hybrid propulsion in the Dutch inland shipping sector is in an early phase and needs such joint efforts to realize the broader goal of reducing emissions.

Modern LNG carriers feature complex and tightly integrated machinery systems to convert the onboard primary energy sources to useful energy demands for propulsion, electricity and heat. Therefore, process modelling and simulation techniques combined with an integrated systems approach is required for the evaluation of different configuration alternatives of LNG carriers. In this paper, we used our in-house process modelling framework DNVGL COSSMOS to develop a generic model of an LNG carrier integrated machinery system encompassing various propulsion and energy recovery technologies. The resulting system model was then coupled with a generic operational profile description accounting for various operating modes and intended trading routes of the vessel. The integrated LNG carrier machinery process model was subsequently used for the evaluation of different technology alternatives and machinery configurations. Namely, the model was used to size the gas-fuel compression trains; assess the introduction and optimal size of an LNG reliquefaction plant; compare electric and mechanical propulsion technologies; and, assess the introduction of energy recovery technologies such as shaft generators and exhaust gas economizers. The model-based studies resulted in an improved insight of this complex integrated machinery arrangement, revealing important performance trade-offs and interrelations between the vessel's sub-systems. The results revealed high energy savings potential of 5% to 8% depending on the energy recovery options implemented, operating profile and trading route. At the same time fuel savings of about 6% were identified, improving the overall cost-effectiveness of the integrated system.

TI  - Machine Intelligence Based Data Handling Framework for Ship Energy Efficiency
AB  - Appropriate navigation strategies should be developed to overcome the current shipping industrial challenges under emission-control-based energy efficiency measures. Effective navigation strategies should be based on accurate ship performance and navigation information; therefore, various onboard data handling systems are installed on ships to collect large-scale datasets. Ship performance and navigation data that are collected to develop such navigation strategies can be an integrated part of the ship energy efficiency management plan (SEEMP). Hence, the SEEMP with various navigation strategies can play an important part of e-navigation under modern integrated bridge systems. This study proposes a machine-intelligence-based data handling framework for ship performance and navigation data to improve the quality of the respective navigation strategies. The prosed framework is divided into two main sections of pre and post processing. The data pre-processing is an onboard application that consists of sensor faults detection, data classification, and data compression steps. The data post processing is a shore-based application (i.e., in data centers) and that consists of data expansion, integrity verification, and data regression steps. Finally, a ship performance and navigation dataset of a selected vessel is analyzed through the proposed framework and successful results are presented in this study.

TI  - Fuel Consumption and CO2 Emission Reductions of Ships Powered by a Fuel-Cell-Based Hybrid Power Source
AB  - The need for technological development to reduce the impact of air pollution caused by ships has been strongly emphasized by many authorities, including the International Maritime Organization (IMO). This has encouraged research to develop an electric propulsion system using hydrogen fuel with the aim of reducing emissions from ships. This paper describes the test bed we constructed to compare our electric propulsion system with existing power sources. Our system uses hybrid power and a diesel engine generator with a combined capacity of 180 kW. To utilize scale-down methodology, the linear interpolation method is applied. The proposed hybrid power source consists of a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC), a battery, and a diesel generator, the capacities of which are 100 kW, 30 Kw, and 50 kW, respectively. The experiments we conducted on the test bed were based on the outcome of an analysis of the electrical power consumed in each operating mode considering different types of merchant ships employed in practice. The output, fuel consumption, and CO2 emission reduction rates of the hybrid and conventional power sources were compared based on the load scenarios created for each type of ship. The CO2 emissions of the hybrid system was compared with the case of the diesel generator alone operation for each load scenario, with an average of 70\%similar to 74\%. This analysis confirmed the effectiveness of using a ship with a fuel-cell-based hybrid power source.

TI  - Requirements for a maritime transition in line with the Paris Agreement
AB  - The shipping industry is a hard-to-abate sector in today's society. Although past studies have looked at levels of carbon pricing, fuel savings, and the upscaling of green fuel availability separately, we combine these critical parameters for a green transition of the shipping industry to show what it takes to reach sectoral emissions reduction targets in line with the Paris Agreement. We utilize a least-cost optimization model drawing on data on, e.g., emissions with lifecycle elements and the costs of green fuel production. We find that reaching maritime reduction targets for a green transition requires high growth rates for green fuel availability, carbon pricing beyond 300EUR/tCO2eq, and at least 50% in fuel demand savings compared to today's demand projection for 2050. The results show the importance of immediate climate action if maritime emissions reduction goals are to be achieved. Â© 2022 The Author(s)

TI  - Proposed Inland Oil Tanker Design in Bangladesh Focusing CO2 Emission Reduction Based on Revised EEDI Parameters
AB  - Though inland ships account for a small portion of the total global CO(2)emissions from shipping, from the individual country's economic and environmental perspective, this is very important. To reduce CO2 emissions from sea-going ships by increasing energy efficiency, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted a generalized Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) in 2011. However, due to the variation in environmental, geographic and economic conditions, a generalized EEDI cannot be established in a similar fashion to that established by IMO. Shallow and restricted water effects, different fuel qualities (to reduce operational cost), increase in engine power requirements, reduction in carrying capacity, cargo availability, etc. make the EEDI by IMO inadequate for inland waterways. Therefore, an EEDI formulation based on revised parameters has been proposed for the inland ships in Bangladesh. This paper focuses on the possibility of CO2 emissions reduction from inland oil tankers in Bangladesh by implementing the revised EEDI formulation (henceforth denoted as EEDIINLAND). A sensitivity analysis was performed for the different ship design parameters of those oil tankers. Based on the analysis, suggestions were made on how to design inland oil tankers in Bangladesh using the revised EEDI formulation for reducing CO2 from the current level without any major cost involvement. Keeping the same speed and capacity, the vessels were redesigned based on those suggestions. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of those redesigned vessels using `Shipflow' showed a reduction in CO2 emissions through increasing EEDI(INLAND)by 7.54-13.65\%.

TI  - METHANOL AS MARINE FUEL BUILDS MOMENTUM
AB  - Methanol-fueled ships have already been built to equivalent technology standards so the flag state and classification community understands it is safe and practical. Research undertaken for the Methanol Institute suggests it can be bunkered at more than 100 ports globally and is either available on site or within close proximity to berths, with very little modification required to the existing bunkering infrastructure. The Methanol Institute is currently engaged in a pilot project in Singapore converting a crew transport service vessel which will also bunker Methanol regularly. Among the elements being studied is the availability of both conventional and renewable/bio methanol to move further towards a low/net carbon neutral environment, faster and in an economically viable manner. Based on over 60,000 hr of dual fuel engine testing conducted over three years by MAN Energy Solutions, a two-stroke engine running on methanol can reduce CO2 emissions by 15% compared with Tier II engines on HFO. Maritime start-up FUELSAVE has attracted more ship owners to its FS MARINE+ process for dynamic and load-based injection of hydrogen, oxygen, methanol, and water into marine engine fuel delivery systems. This resulted in the cleaner and more thorough combustion of fuel, typically HFO, is a dilution of the effects of a dirty primary fuel with a clean-burning alcohol distillate. FS MARINE+ is an efficiency enhancement and emissions reduction solution that achieves real net cost savings while reducing a vesselâ€™s carbon footprint and air pollution.

TI  - Analysis of Environmental Benefits of Shore Power for Preventing and Controlling Air Pollution Caused by Vessels at Berth
AB  - When vessels are berthed at ports, the air pollutants emitted by auxiliary engines will cause severe pollution to the ports and surrounding environments. In view of this situation, the author first summarizes the Chinese policies and policies of foreign countries on emission of air pollutants from vessels at berth, and then analyses the current status of and measures for control of air pollutant emission from vessels at berth. Secondly, the author analyses the environmental benefits of using shore power for better controlling air pollutant emission from vessels at berth, compares vessels using shore power with vessels using generated power in the energy conservation and emission reduction effects based on the fuel consumption rate of different auxiliary engines and current status of pollutant emission from power generation in China etc., analyses the current status of shore power application in China, estimates the energy conserved and emission reduced when shore power is used by vessels at berth. Thirdly, the author identifies the scale of electric energy replacement by, and environmental benefits of, shore power at ports in China. This paper delivers innovative approaches to the comparison between the effects of energy conservation and emission reduction based on fuel consumption rates of different auxiliary engines and estimation of conserved energy and reduced emission.

TI  - The effectiveness and costs of speed reductions on emissions from international shipping
AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping are an increasing concern. The paper evaluates whether vessel speed reduction can be a potentially cost-effective CO(2) Mitigation option for ships calling on US ports. By applying a profit-maximizing equation to estimate route-specific, economically-efficient speeds, we explore policy impacts of a fuel tax and a speed reduction mandate on CO(2) emissions. The profit-maximizing function incorporates opportunity costs associated with speed reduction that go unobserved in more traditional marginal abatement cost analyses. We find that a fuel tax of about \$150/ton fuel will lead to average speed-related CO(2) reductions of about 20-30\%. Moreover, a speed reduction mandate targeted to achieve 20\% CO(2) reduction in the container fleet costs between \$30 and \$200 per ton CO(2) abated, depending on how the fleet responds to a speed reduction mandate.

TI  - Ship operational measures implementationâ€™s impact on energy-saving and GHG emission
AB  - The improvement of ship operation efficiency and the environmental protection are the main pillars for a competitive and sustainable shipping industry. This sustainability depends on the fluctuation of the fuel price market, compulsory international maritime organization environmental regulations and the shipowners policy regarding the energy-saving and their commitment in the reduction of greenhouse gas emission. To ensure a sustainable competitiveness and compliance with environmental requirements of their fleets, the shipping companies have implemented several innovative solutions. Some innovative solutions might be implemented at ship design stage, while others might be implemented at ship operation stage. This paper focuses on the solutions which might be implemented at the operation stage, i.e. ship speed optimization, weather routing optimization, ship trim optimization and hull and propeller condition based maintenance. The effectiveness of these solutions has been demonstrated through study of ship voyages performance reports and simulation of case study. Â© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

TI  - Possible solutions for reducing NOx and SOx emissions from large cargo ships
AB  - In an attempt to curb air pollution from the shipping industry, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed two new sets of standards in July 2009, requiring ships that have compression-ignition engines with a capacity of 30 liters or more per cylinder in U.S. waters to reduce oxides of nitrogen (NO x) emissions by 15%-25% by 2011, and by up to 80% by 2016 from the current level. The stringent new standards will force shipping operators to invest in more efficient and cleaner engine and emission reduction technologies. This paper summarized some potential solutions for emissions reduction from large cargo ships, including selective catalytic reduction technology for NOx reduction, blending of biofuel with heavy fuel oil, application of oxygenates in marine diesel fuel, sea water scrubbing for SOx reduction, and plasma technology for emissions reduction.

TI  - One company's green logistics
AB  - Diesel engines have proven themselves powerful, reliable and efficient. However, emissions from fuel combustion of diesel engine always leave by-products of oxides of nitrogen, unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in the exhaust gas. Therefore, environmentalists call for cleaner technology to be used in place of conventional diesel engine. The alternative option of diesel-electric engine is an applicable modern technology that generates lower air emissions. The diesel-electric engine for marine vessel offers significantly higher energy efficiency and lower air emissions, compared to the traditional diesel engine. Marine diesel-electric engine is a hybrid engine that uses diesel fuel to generate mechanical torque and transform to electrical power for driving motor and propels the ship. The developed electrical systems, where the diesel engine can be operated on a variable speed giving a huge potential in fuel saving. The Gensets operate in variable speed mode, where the rpm can be adjusted for minimum fuel oil consumption according to the system load. It also allows the integration of energy storage sources like batteries. The energy storage sources reduce the transient loads on the diesel engines. A petroleum company has therefore launched a green logistics program and adopt diesel-electric engine into the marine logistic process to be an initiative of the environmental friendly offshore operation. The Anchor Handling Tug Supply (AHTS) operate in the Gulf of Thailand for supporting offshore petroleum production. Since 2012, more than 50% of AHTS operated by diesel engines have been replaced by diesel-electric engines. By implementation of the green logistics program, in 2013 our marine fleet can decreased up to 7,100 m3 of Marine Gas Oil (MGO) consumption, whilst also reduces totally 22,000 tons of CO2e emission. Divided from overall picture, the replacement power driven of AHTS by diesel-electric engines contributed to the fuel saving at 4,000 m3 of MGO or 56 % of total MGO reduction. In economical perspective, a company has an opportunity to cut off fuel expense for 206 MMTHB or 6.9 MMUSD per annual. This could reflect a company determination to stay at forefront of the industry as the leading petroleum exploration and production company driven by green practices throughout our operation and supply chains.

TI  - UECC's HYBRID PCTC TO USE BATTERY FOR BOW THRUSTER
AB  - European ship operator United European Car Carriers (UECC) has successfully operated a pair of LNG-fuelled short-sea PCTC since 2016. UECCâ€™s two existing LNG-fuelled vessels Auto Eco and Auto Energy are the biggest 1A super Finnish/Swedish ice classed PCTC and the first PCTC in the world capable of operating on LNG. They are capable of sailing a 14-day round trip in the Baltic solely on LNG, storing approximately 800 cu m in a cylindrical Type C tank, and were the first clients of the worldâ€™s first seagoing LNG bunkering vessel, ENGIE Zeebrugge. The company is now building a series of three further vessels that will be the first LNG battery hybrid PCTCs in the world. The energy storage system (ESS) system will be charged by a permanent magnet, directly driven shaft generator or dual fuel generators. As part of the total power system, which includes a WinGD 6RT-Flex50DF dual-fuel engine, a controllable pitch propeller, a bulb rudder, two dual-fuel gensets and a dual-fuel boiler, the ESS will provide power to the main switchboard, peak shaving capabilities for the main engine and auxiliaries and offer black-out prevention. The vessels will only require two auxiliaries, as the ESS and the shaft generator eliminate the need for one more that would otherwise have been required. The pioneering design will take UECC beyond the IMO target of 40% reduction in carbon intensity by 2030 through the combination of optimal hull design and the LNG battery hybrid solution.

TI  - Development of a multi-scheme energy management strategy for a hybrid fuel cell driven passenger ship
AB  - Hybrid fuel cell propulsion systems for marine applications are attracting widespread interest due to the need to reduce ship emissions. In order to increase the potential of these systems, the design of an efficient energy management strategy (EMS) is essential to distribute the required power properly between different components of the hybrid system. For a hybrid fuel cell/battery passenger ship, a multi-scheme energy managements strategy is proposed. This strategy is developed using four schemes which are: state-based EMS, equivalent fuel consumption minimization strategy (ECMS), charge-depleting charge-sustaining (CDCS) EMS, the classical proportional-integral (PI) controller based EMS, in addition to a code that chooses the suitable scheme according to the simulation inputs. The main objective of the proposed multi-scheme EMS is to minimize the total consumed energy of the hybrid system in order to increase the energy efficiency of the ship. The world's first fuel cell passenger ship FCS Alsterwasser is considered and its hybrid propulsion system is modelled in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The performance of the developed multi-scheme EMS is compared to the four studied strategies in terms of total consumed energy, hydrogen consumption, total cost and the stresses seen by the hybrid fuel cell/battery system components considering a daily ship operation of 8Â h. Results indicate that a maximum energy and hydrogen consumption savings of 8% and 16.7% respectively can be achieved using the proposed multi-scheme strategy. Â© 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

TI  - Bunkering & fuel testing: Fuel for thought
AB  - Even though shipping is one of the most efficient methods of transport in terms of carbon produced per ton-mile, it is the target of major carbon reduction efforts. Shipping accounts for âˆ¼ 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions which is likely to double by 2050. And as only 30-31% of marine fuel is used to power the vessel, technology will be the crucial factor in reducing these emissions. A discussion on bunkering and fuel testing covers Intertanko's call to the IMO to set target levels for the energy efficiency of new ships; possibility that lMO will regulate shipping by setting its own targets; risks associated with carrying different grades of fuel; drivers for fuel oil testing; concerns on wear to equipment and machinery; monitoring wear; optimizing lubricant feed rate; troubleshooting using online tools and technology; testing marine fuel for H2S content; and Shell's tests using GTL gasoil as a replacement for marine gasoil in a Caterpillar Marine auxiliary engine.

TI  - EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS OF HYDROGEN-NATURAL GAS ENGINES FOR MARITIME APPLICATIONS
AB  - A novel ship propulsion concept employs natural gas to reduce ship emissions and improve overall ship propulsion efficiency. This concept proposes a serial integration of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and a natural gas engine, while anode-off gas (gas at the fuel cell exhaust) is used in the natural gas engine. This study focusses on SOFC-gas engine integration by experimentally analyzing the effects of adding hydrogen, which is the main combustible component of the fuel cell anode-off gas, in marine natural gas engines. The overall challenge is to employ the anode-off gas to improve the performance of marine natural gas engines. To study the effects of anode-off gas combustion in natural gas engines, experiments with hydrogen addition in a marine natural gas engine of 500 kW rated power were performed. Natural gas was replaced with 10 \% and 20 \% of hydrogen, by volume, without any penalties in terms of output power. We found that the high combustion rate of hydrogen improved combustion stability, which allowed for better air-excess ratio control. Thus allowing leaning to higher air-excess ratios and extending the, otherwise, limited operating window Hydrogen addition also improved brake thermal efficiency by 1.2 \%, while keeping NOx emissions below the maritime emission regulations. The improvement in engine efficiency with a larger operating window may help improve the load-taking capabilities of marine natural gas engines.

TI  - MARITIME ENERGY CONTRACTING FOR CLEAN SHIPPING
AB  - To reduce the Sulphur emission from shipping and ensure clean shipping, a number of Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECA) were enforced in special areas around the globe. From 2015, in SECA, ship owners are not allowed to use fuel with more than 0.1\% Sulphur content. One of the major concerns for the SECA regulation is that maritime stakeholders have had to take into consideration the costs as well as the tolerable risks of their compliance investment options. Besides that, low freight rates have increased the competition and had caused financial pressure on ship owners so that lower capital reserves and low credibility levels limit the manoeuvring space for investment activities. The indications from BSR after 2015 showed that the low fuel price has eased the economic effects of the SECA regulation and as a result, most ship owners have delayed their investment decisions. Even though the postponement of emission abatement techniques seems to have reduced the compliance expenses for SECA, they, however, did not improve the position of shipowners relative to their competitors. Consequently, new policy instruments to stimulate innovation, to raise competitiveness and to comply with the new environmental regulations are needed. It would have been easier to hedge fuel price volatility and offer maritime logistics services for a lower price, but to be able to ensure sustainable results in long-term, maritime stakeholders must be ready to device astute strategies that can propel them to unparalleled advantage. This research first appraised the investment risks and payback period associated with the scrubber using different capital budgeting methods. It further illustrated the Maritime Energy Contracting (MEC) model as a market mechanism for the delivery of a cost-effective emission reduction using the scrubber technology as well as an instrument to realise a competitive advantage for ship operators. The results are empirically validated by case studies from BSR.

TI  - Green hydrogen as an alternative fuel for the shipping industry
AB  - There is growing pressure to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from maritime transportation. One of the most effective strategies for reducing GHG emissions is to switch from conventional fuels such as heavy fuel oil to alternative fuels. Green hydrogen is a promising alternative for the shipping industry. Nonetheless, its potential usage will depend on more than its environmental friendliness. Economic, technical, and safety factors must be assessed. This paper provides a critical assessment of the potential usage of green hydrogen in the shipping industry with an evaluation of production routes, techno-economic performance, storage, and safety. Benchmarking is also carried out compared to existing â€˜greyâ€™ and â€˜blueâ€™ production routes specific to shipping industry applications. Important metrics for liquid hydrogen are analyzed to evaluate production cost and GHG emissions for various routes. Furthermore, a comparison is made for the safety and health issues of hydrogen compared to conventional and emerging maritime shipping fuels. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Optimization of River-Sea-Going Ship Type Scheme and Operation Strategy Under Emission Control Area in China
AB  - Throughout Chinese existing river-sea-going ships, there are widespread problems such as chaotic ship types, small average tonnage, serious aging of ships, and low energy efficiency. In order to cater to the requirements of ship emission control areas implemented in China on January 1, 2016, research is carried out on optimization of river-sea-going ship type scheme and operation strategy under emission control area. The lowest cost model of single-ship round-trip voyage is constructed and the ship operation strategies under the emission control zone in China are analyzed. Through discussing the effects of different operation strategies on ship speed, cost and emissions, some suggestions are put forward for the operation of existing river-sea-going ships. At the same time, combining the optimization of design speed with the optimization of ship form schemes, a design speed model of river-sea-going liner based on penalty cost is proposed, and a comprehensive evaluation index system of river-sea-going liner form schemes based on technological advancement, environmental protection and economy is constructed. Systematic optimization of river-sea-going ship type scheme provides an effective way for the preliminary design of the river-sea-going ship, in line with the current river-sea-going shipping background of energy saving and emission reduction in China.

TI  - Scheduling of Power Generation in Hybrid Shipboard Microgrids with Energy Storage Systems
AB  - Concerns about the impact of global warming caused by air pollution and depletion of fossil fuels have attracted attention and opportunities in transportation especially in maritime industry. In all electric ships, the electrical equipment including electric propulsion is connected to the common ship electrical network to achieve better fuel consumption with less emission. However, the low-load factor of the parallel diesel generators (DGs) in some operating conditions, can negatively affect the fuel consumption rate. As an alternative, two or more power sources such as batteries and renewable-based prime movers can be integrated into the system aboard to improve the overall system performance. By optimal scheduling of the power sources, poor low-load efficiency can be avoided and controllable units can be dispatched in an emission-aware and cost-effective manner. This paper analyzes how much the operating cost of a shipboard system can be improved (based on estimation of specific fuel consumption (SFC) curve of a real system) considering the dynamic load profile with and without energy storage systems (ESSs). The case study in this paper is a ferry with a conversion from traditional diesel mechanical power to electrical propulsion powered by DGs and ESSs. Â© 2018 IEEE.

TI  - Prospects of cold ironing as an emissions reduction option
AB  - Cold ironing is the process of providing shorepower to cover the energy demands of ships calling at ports. This technological solution can eliminate the emissions of auxiliary engines at berth, resulting in a global reduction of emissions if the grid powering the ships is an environmentally friendly energy source. This paper conducts a literature review of recent academic work in the field and presents the status of this technology worldwide and the current barriers for its further implementation. The use of cold ironing is mandatory in Californian ports for ship operators and as a result terminal and ship operators were required to invest in this technology. In Europe, all ports will be required to have cold ironing provision by the end of 2025. Other regulations that target local emissions such as Emission Control Areas can have a significant impact on whether cold ironing is used in the future as a potential compliance solution. This paper constructs a quantitative framework for the examination of the technology considering all stakeholders. The role of regulation is shown to be critical for the further adoption of this technology. Illustrative case studies are presented that consider the perspective of ship operators of various ship types, and terminal operators that opt to invest in shorepower facilities. The results of the case studies show that for medium and high fuel price scenarios there is economic motivation for ship operators to use cold ironing. For the port, the cost per abated ton of pollutants is much lower than current estimates of the external costs of pollutants. Therefore, shorepower may be a viable emissions reduction option for the maritime sector, provided that regulatory bodies assist the further adoption of the technology from ship operators and ports. The methodology can be useful to port and ship operators in examining the benefits of using cold ironing as an emissions reduction action. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Hydrogen-based technologies in maritime sector: technical analysis and prospective
AB  - The maritime transportation sector is one of the main contributors to global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has adopted a strategy to reduce these emissions from international shipping >50% by 2050, compared to 2008's emissions. Therefore, ship owners need to adopt solutions to bring emissions within these and other future limits by means of environmentally friendly fuels (hydrogen or hydrogen carriers) and high efficiency propulsion technologies (fuel cells). This paper focuses on the replacement of the conventional Diesel genset installed on a hybrid small-size ferry, with an innovative system based on PEMFC technology. A real case scenario is investigated: the total energy/power demand of the vessel is determined basing on a typical operational profile. Then, a preliminary redesign of its powertrain configuration is proposed along with an energy management strategy. The analysis has allowed to define the hydrogen consumption for a daily operation. Finally, different storage technologies involving both compressed and liquefied hydrogen have been considered and compared, in order to identify ship's weight and space requirements.

In view of this, this paper first analyzes and predicts the shipping business trend, fuel consumption and LNG demand potential in China. Then, this paper makes an investigation into supply price of LNG resources, economical efficiency of LNG's being substitute for fuel oils, and the process of gas-powered vessels development. The following conclusions are drawn of the prospect of LNG as an alternative fuel for shipping vessels in China. (1) LNG is less competitive than fuel oils but more cost-effective than diesel. (2) In the future, LNG supply will satisfy the need of LNG as a vessel fuel and its price will be acceptable in the shipping business in China. (3) From both technical and economic points of view, LNG is a good alternative fuel for inland and offshore cargo ships and engineering ships, but not for fishing boats due to its small tonnage, short shipping time as well as fuel subsidies. (4) There are still many problems to solve in terms of legislation, technology, LNG supply on waters, etc. In general, the replacement of shipping vessel fuels by LNG will first go through a trial period of 2 - 3 years, then a start-up period of 2 - 3 years, and finally come into the business development. (5) With the possibility of this replacement and the process of market cultivation taken into account, it is predicted that the maximum demand volume of LNG as an alternative vessel fuel will be about 0. 6 billion m3 in 2015 and nearly 4 billion m 3 in 2020. In the end, this paper suggests that government departments in charge and the related enterprises should make overall plans and have a sense of ability to reasonably promote this project.

TI  - A framework for the replacement analysis of a hydrogen-based polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell technology on board ships: A step towards decarbonization in the maritime sector
AB  - Maritime transport is one of the largest greenhouse gas emitting sectors of the global economy, responsible for around 1 GtCO2eq every year. To comply with the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, the research is devoted introducing low and zero-carbon fuels and innovative propulsion technologies. In this context, hydrogen fuel cell powertrains can play a crucial role due to their high energy and environmental performances. In this paper, a techno-economic feasibility analysis for replacing an 8.3 MW diesel engine with a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell system is performed for a chemical tanker ship. For this purpose, a detailed method, that aims to estimate the volume and mass of the fuel cell system as well as of the hydrogen storage technologies, is developed. Three on board hydrogen storage technologies are considered: i) compressed hydrogen, ii) liquid hydrogen, iii) metal hydrides. Results highlight that the fuel cell-based powertrain is characterized by 60% less volume and 56% less mass compared to the diesel engine. As far as the hydrogen storage technologies are concerned, all solutions present significantly lower volumetric and gravimetric energy densities and therefore, additional volume and mass are required in comparison with diesel fuel configuration. These results involve a reduction of the total cargo capacity to comply with tanker ship physical constraints. The cargo should be reduced by 1.3%-1.1% for compressed hydrogen (at 350 bar and 700 bar, respectively), 0.1% for liquid hydrogen, and 9% for metal hydrides. Finally, the economic assessment in terms of Operational Expenditures, based upon the predicted hydrogen price reduction as well as the diesel price increase, in different cost scenarios (2020â€“2050), are evaluated. Results show that the competitiveness of the hydrogen solution with a retail price of 4 $/kg can be achieved by considering an incentive for the avoided CO2 equal to 112 $/tons. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Reducing shipboard emissions â€“ Assessment of the role of electrical technologies
AB  - Saving fuel and reducing emissions are major drivers in the marine industry, with a large number of potential modifications and machinery options available to enable the greening of shipping. Assessing which technology and what combination of solutions gives favourable economic results needs careful consideration of the vessel's operational profile. Electrification of shipboard systems introduces operational flexibility, offering the potential for fuel savings and emission reductions. Auxiliary drives, energy storage and onshore power supply are three approaches which address the issues of ship fuel consumption/emissions, specifically during in-harbour operation of vessels. In this paper, the impact of these three technologies on ship environmental performance and energy consumption is assessed by considering a real case RoRo vessel sailing a real operational profile. Models of the resultant system are built such that the machinery configurations can be analysed separately or in conjunction with each other. The results stress the importance of the operational profile of the vessel, showing significant fuel and emissions reductions during in-harbour operations but relatively small savings when considering operation through a complete return voyage. The sensitivity of the results to fuel and utility costs are also considered and shown to have a large impact on the economic feasibility (or otherwise) of different solutions. Â© 2016

TI  - Fuels, oils, and emissions: SMM discussion on emissions issues
AB  - A range of company views and future trends are presented during the 2008 CIMAC Circle at the SMM exhibition in Hamburg, Germany. Brief explanations of the IMO Tier II and Tier III are presented, focusing on the existing ships and newbuildings. Tier III, which will be introduced in 2016, will require a very significant reduction of 80% compared with current level. To allow compliance with IMO sulfur and SOx requirements, IMO has also worked out a three-step approach for reducing the sulfur content of fuel used on ocean-going ships from the current 4.5 to 3.5% in 2012 and 0.5% in 2020. Turbocharging and engine emissions reduction are also presented. Miller timing are used to reduce NOx emissions, which means that significantly higher pressure ratios are needed. The proposed CO2 index, a transport-efficiency indicator that shows the ratio between environmental impact and economic benefit, is also presented.

TI  - An Investment Strategy under Uncertainty on LNG-Powered Vessels for Environmental Compliance
AB  - The shipping industry is investigating alternative fuels for ships in order to comply with stricter emission requirements implemented by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a promising alternative since it could reduce emissions substantially and offer potential fuel cost savings. But the investment in LNG fuelled vessels is currently facing a high degree of uncertainty, such as the differential between the prices of LNG and conventional maritime fuels, the availability of LNG, and the reliability of its supply chain. This paper makes an attempt to study the possibility of investing in LNG powered vessels under uncertainty. A deferral option model is proposed to quantify the value of flexibility for a deferral based on multi-variables following specified stochastic processes. By exploiting the stochastic processes, it is possible to determine the value of deferral by solving a dynamic program using a least squares Monte Carlo simulation. The model is tested on an investment of a new chemical vessel with 19,000 deadweight tonnage (dwt) powered by LNG. Empirical analysis may suggest different investment strategies based on the probabilities of exercising an option, and related option values each year, and it indicates further that the attractiveness of LNG as a ship fuel is dominated by three parameters: difference of ship prices between a LNG powered vessel and a reference one, price difference between LNG and conventional fuel prices, and the share of operation time inside emission control areas (ECAs).

TI  - A modelling system for power consumption of marine traffic
AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has enforced stricter limit on the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission due to environment and climate concern. The measures to reduce GHG emissions from shipping can be divided into two groups. The first one is to improve ship energy efficiency through new technology, optimized operation and logistics, and the second one is to introduce alternative fuels with lower carbon intensity. However, the effectiveness and applicability of any measure depend on ship type, ship size, operation type, operation environment (wind and wave condition), as well as the cost of the measure. It is necessary to evaluate new measures in real shipping scenario. Modeling of ship fuel consumption and emission are fundamental input to evaluate the impacts of shipping on the environment and climate, and to evaluate new measures for reducing GHG emission. A modeling system is developed to estimate ship fuel consumption and emission, based on ship hydrodynamical models, information from Automatic Identification System (AIS), the IHS Fairplay database and metocean data. The modeling system aims to cover most of the ship types equipped with AIS transponders, and it will provide different hydrodynamical models to calculate fuel consumption based on the available ship information. In the paper, the modeling system will be described, and the power consumption from the modeling system are compared with the measurement data on one container ship. The comparison shows that the power consumption predicted with the modeling system agrees with measurement data well. The effects of weather data and measured speed on predicted power consumption are also analyzed. Â© 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). All rights reserved.

TI  - The Research of Power Allocation in Diesel-electric Hybrid Propulsion System
AB  - In the traditional diesel engine propulsion mode, the ships face up to a serial of issues, such as the inefficient performance of marine main engine under low load, the high fuel consumption rate and inferior combustion quality, which hinder the income increase and the pollution decrease. Dieselelectric hybrid propulsion ships can effectively reduce fuel consumption and emissions through reasonable power distribution. Moreover, it also has excellent handling performance and low noise. Taking a certain Deep Water Anchor Handling Tug Supply Vessel as the object, the multiobjective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) was used to optimize the allocation problem of the power system. The optimization calculation and simulation verification were carried out by using MATLAB. Â© 2019 IEEE.

TI  - Green environmentally friendly technologies for shipping and offshore industries
AB  - Environmentally friendly green technological innovations driven by the evolving regulatory landscape have the potential to provide performance solutions for the next generation of ships and offshore vessels. The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, Annex VI (MARPOL) requirements has become one of the most influential pieces of maritime legislation passed setting in motion a series of requirements that change the way vessels are designed and operated. The shipping and offshore industries are being revolutionized by the confluence of Annex VI requirements which limit the amount of sulfur in fuel oil, limit the amount of nitrogen oxides emitted from the engine combustion process, and reduce CO2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. The economics of alternative fuels such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) and low sulfur fuels and the imperatives of operating in Emission Control Areas (ECAs) are driving highly innovative vessel, system, and equipment designs. For vessels with operating profiles best serviced by hybrid type plants, operators can greatly benefit by adopting environmentally friendly green technologies such as renewable energy, alternative fuels, hybrid propulsion and power generation plants, and advanced environmental treatment systems. This paper will outline a number of these advanced green ship technologies currently being adopted in ship and offshore vessel design and considers the opportunities this presents for future vessel designs.

TI  - Biofuel as an alternative shipping fuel: technological, environmental and economic assessment
AB  - Fossil derived fuels available for application within the maritime sector have been dominated by heavy fuel oil (HFO), which is conventionally used in low speed (main) engines, and more refined fuels such as marine diesel oil (MDO), which is consumed in fast or medium speed engines. However, increasing fuel costs and regulatory pressure such as the restrictions placed on sulphur content have increased interest in the use of alternative fuels. A number of alternative fuels have been identified and may be viable for use within the maritime sector including straight vegetable oil (SVO) as an alternative to HFO in low speed engines, biodiesel to replace MDO/MGO in low to medium speed engines and bio-liquefied natural gas (bio-LNG) in gas engines using LNG. The potential sources of biomass feedstocks, conversion pathways and technologies are identified. The key parameters limiting their potential application are examined, in particular, availability, technological development, technical integration, and operational consequences. A proposed solution to overcome these limitations is recommended. The effective implementation of these strategies will enable the more widespread use of biofuels in marine applications, significantly reducing emissions from ships and improving global air quality and also protecting the ecological environment.

TI  - Optimization of a CO2-based Shipboard Waste Heat Recovery System
AB  - Under the resolution adopted at the 62nd Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC), carbon emission restrictions have been implemented for large ships since 2013. In order to comply with this, a number of efforts are being made to reduce fuel consumption in ships. In this study, in order to utilize engine exhaust waste heat, a carbon dioxide power cycle, which utilizes a carbon dioxide as a working fluid in contrast to conventional steam power cycle, was investigated. The power cycle was modeled and simulated to investigate its characteristics and performances under the shipboard waste heat recovery condition. The cycle power was maximized by using multivariate optimization method at various cycle minimum temperature conditions. Simulation results show that when the cycle's lowest temperature varied in the range of 16-40 degC, the waste heat recovery system increases power by 7.1-3.5\%.

TI  - Energy conservation: Passenger and container ships case studies
AB  - The main objective of this paper is to enhance the overall performance of Marine Diesel Engine power plant onboard passenger and container ships through a proposed fresh water generator and combined heat and power system. Fresh water produced will be used for drinking, cleaning and washing purposes, contributing to the high demand consumption particularly onboard passenger ships. The main idea for the proposed fresh water generator is to use the waste heat recovered from scavenging air to provide the heat required to evaporate sea water under vacuum converting it into steam. Energy conservation system for exhaust gases in container ships has a lot of advantages which include reducing fuel consumption for ships, increasing the overall efficiency and reducing the pollutant emissions which go out into the atmosphere. Results of the suggested fresh water generator indicated that for a typical installed propulsion power of 3350 hp consuming 10 ton of fuel oil per day, 8 tons of fresh water will be produced. This amount will be sufficient for 20 persons per day. For a number of diesel engines equipped with the proposed fresh water generator the specific fresh water generation was found to be about 100 gm/hp/hr. Combined heat and power plant is one of the methods used to improve engine performances and a better environment which can reduce emissions and fuel consumption by 4.5%.

TI  - Thermal analysis of thermo-electric power generation system for the waste heat recovery from a marine diesel engine aboard a handymax-size tanker
AB  - The waste heat recovery from marine diesel engines is important in terms of improving the energy efficiency of ships. Thermo-electric generator can be used to convert the waste heat in the ship to the electrical energy. This study investigates the effects of different thermo-electric materials and sea water temperatures on the thermal performance of the thermo-electric power generation system. The polyacetylene, Ba8Ga16Ge30, SiGe and (CuI)001Bi2Te3 are considered thermo-electric materials. The energy of the exhaust gases from the marine diesel engine on a handymax-size tanker is used as the waste heat source. The maximum electrical power of 117 kW is produced for (CuI)0.01Bi2Te3 at the sea water temperature of 5Â°C and the engine load of 100% MCR (Maximum Continuous Rating). However, the minimum electrical power of 18.74 kW is produced for the polyacetylene at 30Â°C and 75% MCR. Â© 2023 the Author(s).

TI  - Innovative Energy Systems: Motivations, Challenges and Possible Solutions in the Cruise Ship Arena
AB  - The worldwide effort on the environmental issue in the maritime field has led to always more stringent regulations on greenhouse gas emission (GHG). In this perspective, the International Maritime Organization has developed regulations intended to increase the ship's efficiency and reduce GHG emissions both in design phase, through the introduction of an Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), either in management phase, adopting the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP). In this challenging perspective, several approaches and technologies adopted in land-based engineering can also be advantageous for marine applications. This is the case of the Distributed Energy Resources (DER) solution applied in landbased microgrids, which increases both the system's efficiency and reliability. This work is primarily focused on methodological aspects related to the adoption of a DER solution on-board cruise ships, with the integration of different energy sources in order to pursue a more flexible, reliable and sustainable management of the ship. In this context, another engineering best practice developed for land-based applications that is further investigated in the paper is related to the on board thermal energy recovery issue, revisited due to the implementation of the DER solution.

TI  - Strategies for the low sulfur policy of imoâ€”an example of a container vessel sailing through a european route
AB  - Ships are an important part in international trade transportation and a major source of pollution. Therefore, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) implemented an amendment to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) Annex VI, which stipulates that the sulfur content in marine fuel oil shall not exceed 0.5 wt.% starting in 2020. In order to meet the IMO low sulfur policy, shipping lines could adopt one of the following strategies: (1) using very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO), i.e., with sulfur content less than 0.5 wt.%; (2) installing scrubbers or other exhaust gas aftertreatment systems; or (3) replacing current fuels with clean alternative fuels such as natural gas. This study evaluates the feasibility and benefits of these strategies for shipping lines in order to determine the most cost-effective measures. First, according to the feasibility of the strategies evaluated by SWOT analysis, although scrubbers can reduce emissions of sulfur oxides into the atmosphere, more and more countries are restricting the discharge of wastewater from open-loop scrubbers into their waters. Instead, VLSFO and liquefied natural gas (LNG) are good choices in terms of environmental protection and economic benefits. Therefore, this study further evaluates the two strategies of replacing high sulfur fuel oil (HSFO) with VLSFO and converting diesel engines to LNG engines based on a cost-benefit methodology. This study took an 8500 TEU container vessel, which is powered by a marine diesel engine with the nominal power of 61,800 kW, sailing the Asian-European route as an example, and calculated the total incremental costs, pollutant emission reductions, and cost benefits arising from the implementation of the VLSFO and LNG strategies, respectively. According to the results of this study, the total incremental cost of LNG is higher than that of VLSFO in the first 4.7 years, but this gradually decreases, making the gap of the total incremental costs between the two strategies wider year by year. In comparison with using HSFO without any improvement, the total incremental costs of the VLSFO and LNG strategies increase by 12.94% and 22.16% over the following five years, respectively. The use of LNG can significantly reduce SOx, PM, NOx, and CO2 emissions; on the other hand, it leads to more CH4 emissions than the VLSFO strategy. Compared to doing nothing, the cumulative reduction rates of SOx, PM, NOx, and CO2 emissions over the next five years after the adoption of the LNG strategy are 3.6%, 7.0%, 70.4%, and 15.7%, respectively. The higher emission reduction rates of LNG compared to VLSFO illustrate that the former has a good effect on the suppression of exhaust gas pollution. In terms of the cost-benefit evaluation of the two strategies, this study shows that the VLSFO strategy is more cost-effective than the LNG strategy in the first 2.5 years, but that the cost-benefit ratio of the latter increases year by year and exceeds that of the former, and the gap between them widens year by year. Based on the evaluation results of this study, the LNG strategy is suitable for ocean-going container vessels with fixed routes and younger or larger sized vessels to meet the IMO low sulfur policy. In contrast, the VLSFO strategy is appropriate for old merchant ships with fewer container spaces. LNG is a suitable medium-and long-term strategy, i.e., for more than 2.5 years, for shipping lines to meet the IMO low sulfur policy, while VLSFO is a suitable short-term strategy.

TI  - A Novel Hybrid Fuel Consumption Prediction Model for Ocean-Going Container Ships Based on Sensor Data
AB  - Accurate, reliable, and real-time prediction of ship fuel consumption is the basis and premise of the development of fuel optimization; however, ship fuel consumption data mainly come from noon reports, and many current modeling methods have been based on a single model; therefore they have low accuracy and robustness. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid fuel consumption prediction model based on sensor data collected from an ocean-going container ship. First, a data processing method is proposed to clean the collected data. Secondly, the Bayesian optimization method of hyperparameters is used to reasonably set the hyperparameter values of the model. Finally, a hybrid fuel consumption prediction model is established by integrating extremely randomized tree (ET), random forest (RF), Xgboost (XGB) and multiple linear regression (MLR) methods. The experimental results show that data cleaning, the size of the dataset, marine environmental factors, and hyperparameter optimization can all affect the accuracy of the model, and the proposed hybrid model provides better predictive performance (higher accuracy) and greater robustness (smaller standard deviation) as compared with a single model. The proposed hybrid model should play a significant role in ship fuel consumption real-time monitoring, fault diagnosis, energy saving and emission reduction, etc.

TI  - The development of a transdisciplinary policy framework for shipping companies to mitigate underwater noise pollution from commercial vessels
AB  - One of the newly emerging environmental issues is underwater noise pollution. It has both negative environmental and socio-economic impacts and threatens sustainable shipping. While other types of shipping pollutants have been regulated and societal awareness has been raised, due to the intangible characteristics of underwater noise pollution, there is neither societal awareness nor an international legally binding instrument to mitigate underwater noise pollution. This paper aims to raise awareness of ship owners regarding UWN pollution by introducing the sources of UWN pollution, as well as proposing a transdisciplinary policy for shipping companies to mitigate UWN pollution from their ships. The proposed policy is aligned with IMO's initial GHG strategy, especially the Energy Efficiency Design Index, Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index, and Enhanced Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan. This multi-dimensional approach will make stakeholders more enthusiastic to tackle underwater noise pollution while enhancing the efficient use of capacities and resources.

TI  - Bionics and green technology in maritime shipping: An assessment of the effect of Salvinia air-layer hull coatings for drag and fuel reduction
AB  - To save energy and reduce environmental impacts, new technologies towards a development of a sustainable 'greener' economy are needed. The main opportunity to improve sustainability by reducing emissions is within the transport sector. More than 90% of all goods worldwide are transported by ships. Particularly maritime ships using heavy fuel oil and marine gas oil play a major role. The total fuel consumption of shipping in 2016 was about 250 m t (domestic ca. 50 m t, international shipping ca. 200 m t). The vast portion of the energy consumption of a ship is the need to overcome the drag between ship hull and water-depending on the shape of the vessel and its size up to 90% of total fuel consumption. This means reducing drag helps to save fuel and reduces carbon emissions as well as pollution considerably. Different techniques for drag reduction are known, e.g. the micro-bubble technique or the bulbous bow. We investigated a novel bioinspired technique since 2002: the application of biomimetic surfaces with long-term stable air layers on ship hulls, serving as a slip agent. This technology is based on the Salvinia Effect, allowing a permanent stabilization of air layers under water. In this case study, we analysed the possible savings, which also could be combined with modified micro-bubble technologies. We calculated, based on a selection of five ship types, representing 75% of the world fleet, that air-layer hull coatings could lead to estimated savings of 32.5 million tons of fuel (meaning 13.0% of the worldwide shipping fuel consumption), equal to 18.5 billion US$ and 130.0 million tons of CO 2e per year. The positive impacts on global temperature and other greenhouse gases are calculated and could be a contributing factor in accomplishing the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The study is a contribution to enhance our patchy knowledge concerning the potential economic and ecological benefit of bionics and biomimetic technologies.

TI  - Analysis of energy efficiencies of in-port ferries and island passenger-ships and improvement policies to reduce CO2 emissions
AB  - This study focuses on estimating CO2 emissions and analysing energy efficiencies using the Energy Efficiency Operational Index (EEOI) for ferries sailing within an urban port of Taiwan and passenger-ships operating on island routes surrounding Taiwan. A comparative analysis of energy efficiency parameters showed that hybrid diesel-electric ferries had a 12% improved efficiency compared to the traditional full-diesel ferries, while high-speed passenger ships had up to 79% lower efficiency than medium-speed passenger ships. Some potential policies for reducing CO2 emissions from in-port ferries and island passenger-ships are presented based on these results. The estimated CO2 emissions from in-port ferries sailing within the urban port could be reduced by 10% when employing hybrid diesel-electric ferries instead of traditional full-diesel ferries. Emissions from island passenger-ships operating on island routes could be reduced by 11â€“26% through utilising small medium-speed passenger ships instead of small high-speed passenger ships and large passenger ships.

TI  - Real performance in seaways and its impact on ship design
AB  - With the recent decision by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to reduce maritime Greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% by 2050, designing and implementing cost-effective measures to reduce fuel consumption and emissions becomes core priority for naval architects, shipbuilders and owners. Although many vessels in recent years have been delivered with new bow types aimed at reducing additional power in a seaway, the tendency has been to fit these to existing designs and not looking at the full potential emission reduction possible by altering main dimensions and total fullness. In this study we demonstrate how simplified models and tools can be used in the early stage of the project to decide main dimensions and fulness with focus on reducing fuel consumption and cost in the seaway.

TI  - INTEGRATED SYSTEM DESIGN AND CONTROL OPTIMIZATION OF HYBRID ELECTRIC PROPULSION SYSTEM USING A BI-LEVEL, NESTED APPROACH
AB  - Hybrid electric powertrain systems present as effective alternatives to traditional vehicle and marine propulsion means with improved fuel efficiency, as well as reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air pollutants. In this study, a new integrated, model-based design and optimization method for hybrid electric propulsion system of a marine vessel (harbor tugboat) has been introduced. The sizes of key hybrid powertrain components, especially the Li-ion battery energy storage system (ESS), which can greatly affect the ship's life-cycle cost (LCC), have been optimized using the fuel efficiency, emission and lifecycle cost model of the hybrid powertrain system. Moreover, the control strategies for the hybrid system, which is essential for achieving the minimum fuel consumption and extending battery life, are optimized. For a given powertrain architecture, the optimal design of a hybrid marine propulsion system involves two critical aspects: the optimal sizing of key powertrain components, and the optimal power control and energy management. In this work, a bi-level, nested optimization framework was proposed to address these two intricate problems jointly. The upper level optimization aims at component size optimization, while the lower level optimization carries out optimal operation control through dynamic programming (DP) to achieve the globally minimum fuel consumption and battery degradation for a given vessel load profile. The optimized Latin hypercube sampling (OLHS), Kriging and the widely used Expected Improvement (EI) online sampling criterion are used to carry out ``small data{''} driven global optimization to solve this nested optimization problem. The obtained results showed significant reduction of the vessel LCC with the optimized hybrid electric powertrain system design and controls. Reduced engine size and operation time, as well as improved operation efficiency of the hybrid system also greatly decreased the GHG emissions compared to traditional mechanical propulsion.

TI  - Design of the security alarm control system for LNG-fueled vessels
AB  - With the rapid growth of the economy, air pollution becomes increasingly serious and environment protection has attracted more attention. It is a fact that ships produce enormous air pollution emissions with high energy consumption and research has been constantly carried out on clean energy applications. LNG as an alternative clean marine fuel to run on ships is still at an initial stage. Different from traditional energy resources, LNG may generate risks in the process of application. Security alarm control system will effectively monitor risk sources preventing the occurrence of danger. Based on the deep analysis of the pros and cons of the existing structure and mode of security alarm control system of LNG-fueled vessels combined with the work and risk characteristics of marine engine, storage tanks and gas supply piping which have different danger sources, design a new type security alarm control system to optimize the structure design and logic control mode and implement functions of automatic detection, alarm and device control of combustible gas from risk sources. The system is stable and reliable with easy operation effectively reducing the risks of LNG-fueled ships.

TI  - Bi-Objective Optimization of Vessel Speed and Route for Sustainable Coastal Shipping under the Regulations of Emission Control Areas
AB  - To comply with the regulations of emission control areas (ECAs), most operators have to switch to low-sulfur fuels inside the ECAs. Besides, a low-carbon objective is essential for long-term environmental protection; thus, is regarded as important as making profit. Therefore, the operators start making speed and route decisions under the two objectives of minimizing carbon emissions and maximizing profit. Drawing on existing methods, this paper formulates the profit and carbon emissions in sustainable coastal shipping, investigates the speed and route principles, and determines the best tradeoff between profit and carbon emissions. It is found that vessel speed should be set between emissions-optimum speed and profit-optimum speed, and the route must be selected in light of the speed decision. Next, the optimal choices of speed and route were examined under different scenarios and vessel types. The results show that the operation measures and objectives depend greatly on fuel price, vessel load, and vessel parameters. The operator should speed up the vessel if he/she wants to make more profit or if the scenario is favorable for profit making; e.g., low fuel price and high vessel load (LFHL). Large vessels should pursue more profit under LFHL conditions, without having to sail further outside the ECA. But this rule does not apply to small vessels. In addition, the operator should slow down the vessel inside the ECA and sail further, outside the ECA, with the growth in the price spread between marine gas oil (MGO) and heavy fuel oil (HFO), especially at a low HFO price. The research findings help operators to design operational measures that best suit the limit on sulfur content in fuel and the situation of the shipping market.

TI  - Ship fuel consumption monitoring and fault detection via partial least squares and control charts of navigation data
AB  - New regulations in the shipping sector aim to give greater transparency to operations and public access to CO2 emissions data. EU regulation 2015/757 became mandatory in January 2018 and urges shipping companies to set up systems for daily monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of emissions for individual ships. Manual acquisition and handling of emissions data may be allowed (e.g. bunker fuel delivery note, bunker fuel tank monitoring), but is adversely affected by uncertainty due to human intervention and will eventually be unusable for monitoring purposes. However, the massive amounts of navigation data acquired by multi-sensor systems installed on-board of modern ships have great potential to aid compliance with regulations but their use is hampered by the lack of effective analytical methods in the maritime literature. This work demonstrates a statistical framework and automatic reporting system for fuel consumption monitoring that addresses the MRV requirements needed to comply with the regulations. The framework has been applied to the Grimaldi Group's Ro-Ro Pax cruise ships and is shown, in addition, to be capable of supporting fault detection as well as verifying CO2 savings achieved after energy efficiency initiatives.

TI  - The cost of innovative and sustainable future ship energy systems
AB  - The latest guidelines approved by the environmental protection committee of the international maritime organization (IMO) will require the shipping sector to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% before 2050 and achieve a complete decarbonization by the end of the century. This will require a major change in the way ships are built and operated today. In this paper, we aim at understanding what types of ship energy systems and fuels will be preferable and what will be the costs to achieve the environmental goals set by IMO for shipping. To do this, we approach the question as an MILP problem, with increasingly stringent constraints on the total GHG emissions and with the objective of minimizing the total cost of ownership. We apply this analysis to three ship types (a containership, a tanker, and a passenger ferry) and we determine what type of choice for the shipâ€™s energy systems will be the most optimal, for each ship type. The results show that the most cost-effective pathway towards the elimination of GHG emissions is composed of a first phase with LNG as fuel and with an increasing use of carbon capture and storage, while the full decarbonisation of the shipping sector will require switching to hydrogen as fuel. These results depend only marginally on the type of ship investigated and on the type of regulation enforced. While the costs required to achieve up to 75% GHG emission reduction are relatively similar to the baseline case (50-70% higher), moving towards a full decarbonisation will require a cost increase ranging between 280% and 340% higher than the business as usual.

TI  - Decarbonisation of maritime transport - European Union measures as an inspiration for global solutions
AB  - The EU Regulation 2015/757 established a monitoring, reporting and verification (EU MRV) mechanism for CO2 emissions from shipping. Certainly, given the international nature of shipping, the optimum solution would be to introduce appropriate mechanisms within the framework of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). However, the IMO Data Collection System for ship fuel oil consumption data (IMO DCS), established in 2016 and similar to the EU MRV mechanism, has not been perceived as sufficient given the EU's ambitions to achieve swift decarbonisation of maritime transport. The fragmentation of greenhouse gas emission regulation has also consequences for the Port State Control inspections. The article explores the EU MRV and IMO DCS co-existence in terms of financial penalties and other types of sanctions in case of non-compliance with the EU MRV or IMO DCS obligations.

TI  - Impacts of the Increasingly Strict Sulfur Limit on Compliance Option Choices: The Case Study of Chinese SECA
AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has proposed several environmental regulations on controlling SOx and NOx emissions from ships in coastal areas. Under the framework of IMO, some areas have established strict emission control areas (ECAs) to reduce emissions, which mainly contain Europe and North America. To further strengthen the control and supervision over air pollutants from shipping activities, the Sulfur cap regulation of 0.5\% by mass will come into effect on 1 January, 2020 globally, when all the sailing vessels on the high sea should use fuels with sulfur content less than 0.5\%. This limit is stricter for the global recognized sulfur emission control areas (SECAs), where it was 0.1\% since 1 January 2015. However, Chinese local SECA lags behind the globally recognized SECAs, where the 0.5\% Sulfur cap was implemented from 2016 and it has to be strengthened along with the global sulfur cap 2020. These increasingly stringent emission regulations have huge effects on shipping operators. The current study discusses the potential impacts of the stricter sulfur cap on operators' compliance option choices, where fuel-switching and scrubber system are analyzed under different sulfur limits. Meanwhile, the slow steaming practice is incorporated into the fuel-switching option by considering speed differentiation in different sulfur limit areas. This study develops a cost-minimizing model using NPV (net present value) method. It analyzes the optimal option within vessels' lifespan considering the tradeoff between the initial investment and future operational cost for newbuilding vessels based on a case study. In addition, emissions of CO2 and SOx are compared under different compliance options in different sulfur cap scenarios. Our results find that the scrubber system is a suitable option to comply with the 0.5\% global sulfur limit, and a higher efficiency of sulfur abatement can be attained by the scrubber system option. However, it emits more carbon emissions due to higher energy consumption used by the scrubber system. In addition, the effects of additional vessels deployed in the cycle on the compliance choices are also demonstrated in the analysis.

TI  - Adapting the shipping sector to stricter emissions regulations: Fuel switching or installing a scrubber?
AB  - This paper examines how the existing fleet in the shipping industry can be adapted to the new emission regulations through the two main techniques that currently exist: (a) the use of low sulphur marine diesels; and (b) the installation of scrubbers. A method is presented here for drawing up an economic assessment of both these techniques under uncertainty. It enables the best option to be selected at any given time taking into account fuel prices (spot and futures), scrubber installation costs, the time that the vessel operates in an Emission Control Area (ECA) and the remaining useful lifetime of the vessel. The paper also considers the possibility of an unexpected change from a non-ECA navigation area to an ECA. The assessment is carried out in a manner consistent with marine diesel and crude oil spot and futures market quotes. Our results show the net present value of investing in the installation of scrubbers and investing in changing fuel types for different assumptions on how vessels are operated. We also analyse increases in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions as a consequence of using scrubbers and how they affects the financial analysis if such incremental emissions must be paid under a CO2 pricing mechanism.

TI  - Ship life cycle greenhouse gas emissions
AB  - The international maritime transport sector is known as one of the oldest industries in the world. Ships are used for various purposes from transportation to militaryÂ and they areÂ considered vital for global trade since their main use is for the transport of goods around the world. Currently, the international commercial shipping sector is carrying out nearly nine out of ten tons of the global cargo transportation needs. Despite the fact that the effect of shipping emissions to global warming is limited when compared to other modes of transport, greenhouse gas emissions constitute a serious issue for shipping as well. Just as any other product, a ship has a life cycle which is expected to last 20â€“30 years or more. A shipâ€™s life cycle may be divided into four main phases: manufacturing, operation, maintenance and dismantling/recycling. The great portion of emissions occurs during the operational phase due to the propulsion and energy demands of the ship however greenhouse gases are emitted also in other phases of the ship life cycle. In this study, a life cycle concept for ships is comprehensively described and some illustrative emission results are provided in particular for ship greenhouse gas emissions (GHGâ€™s).

TI  - Decarbonization in Shipping Industry: A Review of Research, Technology Development, and Innovation Proposals
AB  - This review paper examines the possible pathways and possible technologies available that will help the shipping sector achieve the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) deep decarbonization targets by 2050. There has been increased interest from important stakeholders regarding deep decarbonization, evidenced by market surveys conducted by Shell and Deloitte. However, deep decarbonization will require financial incentives and policies at an international and regional level given the maritime sector's similar to 3\% contribution to green house gas (GHG) emissions. The review paper, based on research articles and grey literature, discusses technoeconomic problems and/or benefits for technologies that will help the shipping sector achieve the IMO's targets. The review presents a discussion on the recent literature regarding alternative fuels (nuclear, hydrogen, ammonia, methanol), renewable energy sources (biofuels, wind, solar), the maturity of technologies (fuel cells, internal combustion engines) as well as technical and operational strategies to reduce fuel consumption for new and existing ships (slow steaming, cleaning and coating, waste heat recovery, hull and propeller design). The IMO's 2050 targets will be achieved via radical technology shift together with the aid of social pressure, financial incentives, regulatory and legislative reforms at the local, regional and international level.

TI  - The Influence of Economic Barriers and Drivers on Energy Efficiency Investments in Maritime Shipping, from the Perspective of the Principal-Agent Problem
AB  - Maritime transport stands out as a strategic sector; the increasing trend in maritime traffic makes it essential to reduce energy consumption and emissions through investment in energy efficiency. However, investments can be hindered by barriers, and drivers are necessary to reduce or overcome them and promote investment. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to analyze what factors influence investment decisions-and how they do so-when there are principal-agent problems in the shipowner-charterer relationship. The methodology is based on the following process: model and hypotheses formulation, variable definition, the creation of a study sample and statistical treatment through a descriptive analysis of variables and a binomial logistic regression model, all based on a state-of-the-art application. The results corroborate the hypotheses and indicate that principal-agent problems and split incentives, especially in time charter contracts, and a lack of verified information make the shipowners less likely to invest. Moreover, energy efficiency measures are less likely to be implemented in older vessels, possibly due to the difficulty associated with recovering the investment; they are more likely in larger and newer vessels, and regulation encourage their adoption. Furthermore, investment is more likely in vessels with verified information and high levels of both activity and harmful emissions. Improved knowledge in this field could help businesses and governments to act in a more sustainable manner, without detriment to an innovative and competitive sector.

TI  - TOWARDS ZERO SHIP EMISSIONS II â€“ PROJECT GREENSHIP
AB  - IMO's own International Shipping Facts and Figures report 2012 stated the number of vessels across the globe of 100 Gross Tonnage and over was 104,304, with cargo carrying vessels being 55,138 and expressed concern about the exponential increase of CO2, NO2, CH4 and so forth in recent year. The EU responded by setting targets. The EU 2050 objectives set some intermediate targets for Eco-Efficient Vessel Emission Reduction for key pollutants: CO2: >80% (-30% by 2020), NOx: 100% (-80% by 2020), SOx: 100% (-80% by 2020) and Noise Reduction: -3dB. A review of current research (Ziarati et al, 2018) clearly shows that the targets set for 2020 by both IMO and EU were not achieved and the 2050 goals are also unlikely to be achieved. The Industry is taking steps to reduce its air pollution and carbon footprint due to recent and upcoming IMO and EU regulations; IMO GHG study, Buhang et al (2009) reports that IMO has introduced some limits but has been unable to monitor ship emissions. EMSA has tried the use of satellites and drones to monitor ships, which pollute the sea but has been unable to monitor ship emissions and waste discharge at sea effectively due to technical difficulties and also vastness of the oceans. As the regulations and technologies governing energy efficiency on board ships becomes more complex it is realised by both the IMO and the shipping industry that seafarers need specific training to a much higher level in these fields. There needs to be a position specifically for managing, checking and controlling a shipâ€™s emissions for gases that are harmful to human health and the environment, an "Emissions Manager". As this is a brand new position, there are neither defined competences for this role nor any specific knowledge, understanding or proficiency for it. The paper gives full account of IMO efforts in recent years in setting legislation for key pollutants and reports on a new job specification for the Emissions Manager and proposes that an e-course being developed by several EU member states for the training of key ship officers and crew on how to minimise and monitor harmful emissions. The corresponding programme concerned with the current practice of managing emissions as well as the principle of making ships energy efficient. The new training programme targets both current cadets and existing seafarers in order to complement their skills.

TI  - Strategy development for retrofitting ships for implementing shore side electricity
AB  - Shore side electricity (SSE) is the use of electricity from the shore to power a ship's system when it is berthing at ports. It is a solution to reduce the emissions of auxiliary engines at berth and to improve the local and regional air quality. This paper develops a multi-objective model that integrates spatial and temporal dimensions for strategic planning regarding whether and when to retrofit ships to use SSE. The strategic planning problem is to maximize the environmental benefit and to minimize the payback period of the investment over the entire planning horizon. By adopting an improved multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), a series of retrofit strategies for container ships calling at Dalian Port in China are obtained under a projected annual visiting frequency of ships with different ship sizes and shipping lines. Depending on a selected retrofit strategy, the sum of the payback periods of ships that are determined to be retrofitted is 46 years (on average less than four years) and the environmental benefit of using SSE can be up to 128 million USD for Dalian Port in the planning horizon from 2020 to 2035. The results show that using SSE is an efficient method to decline emissions within the maritime sector and validate that the proposed methodology can be useful to ship owners to decide upon investing in SSE applications and to promote the development of green shipping and green ports.

TI  - Hybrid Electric Solutions for Marine Applications
AB  - The transition to a sustainable economy is one of the major undertakings in human history. Meeting the International Maritime Organization's goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions from ships by 2050 is a critical step toward sustainability. It will require a comprehensive and proactive response from the maritime community. Shipping is well positioned to take concrete action by choosing to implement technologies that provide reduced fuel consumption and lower emissions. Technical solutions to improve energy efficiency and to decarbonize shipping are increasingly leading towards electrification in marine applications. Electric propulsion enables to optimize the power production under varying load profiles, and simplifies integration of energy storage systems and alternative power sources. In marine power distribution, DC grid solutions are gaining popularity and increasing the content of power electronics in shipboard power systems. Strict regulations and requirements to cut emissions are accelerating investments in renewable hydrogen and electrofuels. Accordingly, the marine industry is undergoing a rapid transition from fossil to alternative low-carbon fuels. This will introduce fuel cells as a credible alternative to internal combustion engines, and further increasing the share of electric power distribution semiconductorbased power conversion.

TI  - Effects of adverse sea conditions on propulsion and manoeuvring performance of low-powered ocean-going cargo ship
AB  - Current EEDI (Energy Efficiency Design Index) regulations striving to reduce the installed engine power on new ships for a low EEDI may lead to underpowered ships having insufficient power when operating in adverse sea conditions. In this paper, the operational safety of a low-powered ocean-going cargo ship operating in adverse sea conditions has been investigated using an integrated ship propulsion, manoeuvring and sea state model. The ship propulsion and manoeuvring performance, especially the dynamic engine behaviour, when the ship is sailing in heavy weather and turning into head sea, have been studied. According to the results, the dynamic engine behaviour should be considered when assessing the ship operational safety, as the static engine operating envelope is inadequate for the safety assessment. The impact of PTO/PTI (power-take-off/in) operation and changing propeller pitch on the ship thrust availability in adverse sea conditions have also been investigated. To protect the engine from mechanical and thermal overloading, compressor surge and over-speeding during dynamic ship operations and/or in high sea states, the engine and propeller should be carefully controlled. The paper shows that if in (heavy) adverse weather the propeller pitch can be reduced or if the shaft generator can work as a motor (PTI), more thrust can be developed which can significantly improve the operational safety of the ship.

TI  - LNG AS SHIP FUEL FOR SOX EMISSION REDUCTION TARGET IN THE SEA OF MARMARA
AB  - Maritime transport is the most environmentally friendly type of transport mode. However, ships' exhaust emissions affect negatively and considerably air quality and human health. Since ships release exhaust emissions to air on a large scale, IMO has adopted the Annex VI `prevention of air pollution' from vessels' to the MARPOL73/78 Convention in 1997. This annex put limits on SOx NOx and PM emissions in both worldwide and Emission Control Areas (ECA) {[}1]. Turkey also adopted MARPOL Annex VI, and expected that an ECA will be announced in Turkish territorial waters in near future. Additionally, regulations on ECAs force ship owners or managers to use alternative technologies or fuels in order to reduce ship emissions. In this study, ship emission reduction ways are analysed, especially low sulphur marine gas oil (MGO) and LNG as ship fuels for SECA. Environmentally, two subjects have been discussed which are: total emissions from ships passing through Turkish Straits, and how much emission reduction can be obtained if these ships would use LNG or MGO as fuel. Financially, external costs of ship emissions onto national economy and investment costs for ship owners for new LNG fuelled ships or retrofitting of existing ships have been analysed by using Payback Period and Net Present Value methods.

TI  - Study and simulation on the energy efficiency management control strategy of ship based on clean propulsion system
AB  - Nowadays, with the higher voice of ship energy saving and emission reduction, the research on energy efficiency management is particularly necessary. Energy efficiency management and control of ships is an effective way to improve the ship energy efficiency. In this paper, according to the new clean propulsion system configurations of 5000 tons of bulk carrier, the energy efficiency management control strategy of the clean propulsion system is designed based on the model of advanced brushless doubly-fed shaft generator, propulsion system using LNG/diesel dual fuel engine and energy consumption of the main engine for reducing energy consumption. The simulation model of the entire propulsion system and the designed control strategy were designed. The influence of the engine speed on the ship energy efficiency was analyzed, and the feasibility of the energy efficiency management control strategies was verified by simulation using Matlab/Simulink. The results show that the designed strategies can ensure the power requirement of the whole ship under different conditions and improve the ship energy efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions.

TI  - Green technologies for offshore industry
AB  - Environmental technological innovations driven by the evolving regulatory landscape have the potential to provide performance solutions for the next generation of offshore vessels. Future historians may look back at the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, Annex VI (MARPOL) requirements as one of the most important pieces of maritime legislation passed. It sets in motion a series of requirements that change the way vessels are designed and operated. For all practical purposes, the offshore industry may be revolutionized by the confluence of Annex VI requirements which limit the amount of sulfur in fuel oil, limit the amount of nitrogen oxides emitted from the engine combustion process, and reduce CO2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. The economics of alternative fuels such as LNG and the imperatives of operating in Emission Control Areas (ECA) are driving innovative vessel designs. Offshore vessel operators of the world can greatly benefit by adopting green technologies such as renewable energy, alternative fuels, hybrid propulsion and power generation plants, and advanced environmental systems. This paper will outline a number of emission pollutant driven and energy efficiency driven green ship technologies currently being adopted in offshore vessel design, and considers the opportunities this presents for future designs.

TI  - Environmental protection and energy efficiency improvement by using natural gas fuel in maritime transportation
AB  - Emissions from vessels are a major environmental concern because of their impacts on the deterioration of the environment, especially global warming of the atmosphere. Therefore, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) concerns significant care to environmental protection through the reduction of exhaust emission and improvement of energy efficiency through technical and operational measures. Among the suggested measures from IMO, the alternative fuel such as natural gas has the priority to be used instead of fossil fuels. The present paper calculates the effect of using natural gas in a dual-fuel engine from environmental and energy efficiency perspectives. As a case study, a container ship has been investigated. The results of the analysis show that the percent of CO2, NOx, and SOx emission reduction corresponding to using a dual-fuel engine operated by natural gas instead of a diesel engine operated by heavy fuel oil is about 30.4%, 85.3%, and 97%, respectively. Moreover, it found that NOx and SOx emission rates of the dual-fuel engine comply with the IMO 2016 and 2020 limits, respectively. Furthermore, the Energy Efficiency Design Index value in the case of using dual-fuel engine is lower than the value by using diesel engine by about 30%, and this value will be 77.18%, 86.84%, and 99.27% of the required value for the first, second, and third phases, respectively, as recommended by IMO.

TI  - A hydrogen fuelled fast marine transportation system
AB  - Hydrogen may offer considerable potential as a marine fuel. The lower fuel mass when compared with existing hydrocarbon fuels can usefully increase payload which in turn benefits the economics of oceanic transport and provides the opportunity to compete in new markets. The potential to virtually eliminate pollution at the point of use may prove significant at a time when exhaust emissions from shipping are becoming a matter of global concern. The potential for hydrogen in the marine environment, the current state of transferable technologies, the particular technical and economic issues that need to be addressed are considered in the context of a design study being conducted on a high speed foil-assisted catamaran capable of transporting 600 industry standard containers at speeds of up to 64 knots (118.5 km/hr) over trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic trade routes. It is concluded that such a vessel is technically feasible and could achieve door-to-door delivery times as part of an integrated transport chain otherwise only possible by airfreight but at a fraction of the cost.

TI  - Thermodynamic analysis and performance optimization of the supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle combined with the Kalina cycle for waste heat recovery from a marine low-speed diesel engine
AB  - With the continuous rise in world oil prices and increasing environmental awareness, how to improve ship energy efficiency and reduce ship pollution emissions has become a common concern of the shipping industry. Waste heat recovery technology is an effective method to improve the fuel economy of ships and help the future ships to meet the increasingly stringent Energy Efficiency Design Index of the International Maritime Organization. Under the thermodynamic analysis results of the 8S90ME-C10.2 low-speed marine diesel engine, this paper proposed a waste heat recovery scheme that combined the supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle power generation system with the Kalina cycle power generation system. According to the energy and exergy balances of the combined cycle system, a MATLAB program based on the REFPROP database was established. With the application of control variate method, the influence of the key operating parameters including the main compressor inlet temperature, the turbine inlet temperature, the main compressor outlet pressure, the expander inlet pressure, and the ammonia solution mass concentration on the system performance was thoroughly analyzed. Moreover, the multi-objective optimization matching between the diesel engine and the combined power generation system was carried out from the viewpoints of the thermodynamic performance and economic performance and the impact of the system on the fuel economy and the Energy Efficiency Design Index of the ship was calculated. The results showed that the combined power generation system was used to recycle the waste heat of diesel engine exhaust gas and bypass exhaust gas to generate electricity, which reduced the annual fuel consumption and the Energy Efficiency Design Index to 16.62\% and 15.01\%, respectively. Finally, this study provides a reference for researchers to study the combined use of supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle and Kalina cycle to recycle the waste heat of the marine diesel engine.

TI  - Low carbon shipping: Consideration of the applicability of IMO greenhouse gas regulations to warships
AB  - In December 2003, the International Maritime Organisation Assembly adopted resolution A.963(23) on policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from international maritime commercial shipping. The outcomes to date are three policies; the " Energy Efficiency Design Index " (EEDI), the " Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan" (SEEMP) and the " Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator" (EEOI). The first two of these were included in MARPOL Annex VI Chapter 4 in July 2011 at MEPC 62 and apply to certain types of commercial ships. Although warships are exempt from IMO regulations, many navies throughout the world strive to meet IMO environmental regulations. As most navies are a reflection of their governments" policy, environmental stewardship is generally held as a high priority for navies during peacetime operations. This paper explores if and how the EEDI and SEEMP can be applied to warships.

TI  - Enabling Technologies for Sustainable All - Electric Hybrid Vessels
AB  - The global marine fleets have been reported to consume approximately 300 million tons of fuel annually and contribute 2.8\% of global greenhouse gases emissions (GHG). It is widely projected that the numbers will continue to grow, predominantly driven by the increase in global trades and energy demand from emerging countries. In recent years, enabling technologies, such as hybrid electrical propulsion system and advanced power management strategies, have been developed and introduced to the marine industries not only to reduce fuel consumption, but also to adhere to the increasingly stringent regulations on emissions by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Such technologies are especially critical for vessels that operate in the water near urban areas, such as ferries and tugs, which may contribute up to 15\% of the global marine fleet fuel consumption. In this paper, the design and integration of hybrid electrical propulsion systems, with the use of modern DC distribution and energy storage systems, will be discussed and compared to conventional systems. The benefits of hybrid all-electric power and propulsion system in terms of fuel and energy consumption, emission reduction, performance, as well as system redundancy are presented in this paper.

TI  - Classification: Clean air, clean ships, with LNG propulsion
AB  - Bureau Veritas (BV) is working on solutions for LNG use as fuel for passenger vessels. BV believes that the marine industry needs to look at new ways of reducing the environmental impact from ships as public opinion becomes ever more focused on green issues. Several new projects are in the pipeline with the goal of an environmental friendly passenger ship, with no marine emissions and very low emissions to air. Engine makers have families of dual-fuel engines that can burn fuel or LNG and BV was the first to class dual fuel vessels. The issues that now need to be resolved are how to apply a technology which works on gas carriers to the more regulated and sensitive area of passenger vessels. There is considerable synergy between these two sectors at extreme ends of the shipping industry, i.e., they share a common concern on energy efficiency and reduction of air emissions. Moreover, there is a market for LNG-fuelled ferries, which can operate on fixed routes. At present, BV considers that there is a lack of global distribution of LNG in ports used by passenger ships, and logistical problems related to bunkering. A further major issue for passenger ships that want to use LNG as a secondary fuel is finding sufficient space onboard suitably located for LNG storage.

TI  - A study on estimation methodology of GHG emission from vessels by using energy efficiency index and time series monitoring data
AB  - The National Maritime Research Institute of Japan (NMRI) has developed an Eco-Shipping Support System for domestic coastal shipping to provide energy saving navigation route and just-in-time speed plan. The operations by these services using weather routing are becoming a popular method combined with the rising fuel price. Accordingly, many simulation-based studies have been accomplished for comparative analysis. However, shipping company attempt to evaluate the effects of these operations based on actual data. The NMRI has developed methodologies to evaluate the amount of GHG emission reductions by using the speed plan services. One is based on Energy Efficiency Navigational Indicator (EENI), which is proposed to evaluate both loaded and unloaded conditions, in different size and speed of ships. The other is the estimate of operational performances of ship by using monitoring data. This paper presents applicability of these estimation methodologies to actual ships. Consequently,effectiveness and practical applicability was confirmed. Â© 2015 Taylor & Francis Group

TI  - Electric Power Integration Schemes of the Hybrid Fuel Cells and Batteries-Fed Marine Vessels-An Overview
AB  - Transportation electrification is undergoing a significant transition toward the utilization of efficient and reliable energy sources and smart integration schemes, where this transitioning is continuously facing ever-tightening challenges in order to comply with the increased environmental regulations. Among the different means of transportation, global maritime transport is responsible for 2\%-3\% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and it is predicted to increase to 17\% by 2050 if no changes are adapted. Hence, the international maritime organization (IMO) has targeted to reach a 50\% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050 compared to 2008. Hence, alternative energy sources shall be utilized in order to meet these strict GHG emissions reduction targets, where battery- and hydrogen-fed fuel cells can play a vital role in such aspects. Since the output of these two energy sources is unregulated dc voltage, their connection to the whole ship power system can be accomplished in several ways, where each way has its features, in addition to utilizing different power conditioning stages (PCSs), and these features are not well clarified and compared in the literature. Hence, this article presents an overview of the possible integration schemes that can be utilized in fuel cell- and battery-fed vessels, which is supported with a comparative assessment. This is also presented along with highlighting the state-of-the-art PCSs that are available in the market and can be utilized in these integration schemes within marine vessels. Such overview and comparative assessment are seen to be of significant importance and added value for researchers and developers in both the academic and industrial sides in order to accelerate the adoption of fuel cells in marine systems for zero-emission shipping.

TI  - Biodiesel as alternative fuel for marine diesel engine applications: A review
AB  - Transportation and shipping activities are major contributor to air pollution at sea where most of it occurs as a result of exhaust emissions from ships. Stringent emission limitations enforced by the International Maritime Organization have hastened the need to find a new alternative fuel for marine diesel engines. Thus, biodiesel fuel was chosen as one of the environmentally friendly alternative energy that can reduce ship toxic gas emissions and at the same time reduces dependence on petroleum-based fuels. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of biodiesel as an alternative fuel for marine diesel engine applications. This review covers the biodiesel fuel background, engine performance, history, recent progress, engine warranty, issues, challenges, and possible solutions on using biodiesel for marine applications. A significant number of literatures from indexed journals were cited accordingly. The results of previous studies had shown that the use of biodiesel would mostly increase the amount of brake specific fuel consumption and nitrogen oxide gas while conversely reducing other toxic gas emissions. Although a number of issues and challenges arise, most marine engine manufacturers give conditional warranty against the use of biodiesel in the engines. The study concluded that biodiesel and its blends have a bright future in the marine sector, provided some of the highlighted issues can be solved. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Can Market-based Measures Stimulate Investments in Green Technologies for the Abatement of GHG Emissions from Shipping? A Review of Proposed Market-based Measures
AB  - In order for the maritime sector to align itself with the targets set by the Paris Agreement, it should reduce its GHG emissions by at least 50\% by 2050 compared to 2008 with the ultimate aim to phase them out entirely. It is along these lines that in April 2018 the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) developed a strategy, consisting of a range of potential technical and operational measures to reduce GHG emissions from international shipping, ranking from improvements on ship design to the employment of alternative fuels. In order to stimulate the adoption of these policies, the IMO also considers the implementation of market-based measures (MBM) that will provide additional incentives to shipowners to invest in new technologies and uptake of cleaner fuels. The MBMs analysed in this paper include two different policies proposed by different countries and associations for the abatement of GHG emissions from shipping: a) the International Fund for GHG emissions from ships that includes the imposition of a global levy on marine bunker fuel for all vessels and b) the Maritime Emission Trading System (METS) that requires all maritime companies to buy/sell emission allowances to meet their annual emission reductions targets, setting a cap on global shipping emissions. This paper presents and analyses these two diverse MBMs, highlighting their main advantages and drawbacks. The scope of this paper is to investigate the potential of these MBMs to incentivise investments in new technologies and alternative fuels, both essential for the decarbonisation of the maritime sector.

TI  - COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT SHIP EMISSION ESTIMATION METHODOLOGIES FOR ANNUAL EMISSION FOOTPRINT AND REDUCTION TECHNIQUES OF A BULK CARRIER
AB  - Ships have an indispensable role in trading and transportation. Due to the growth of population and the new demands of the growing economies, the need for shipping but also its harmful effects are increasing and emission problems will grow further in the future. The main harmful effects caused by shipping are carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), oxides of sulfur (SOx), particulate matter (PM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and black carbon (BC). The emissions have global effects on the health of a large number of people, especially those living in cities with a harbour. Although emissions caused by shipping are comparatively small, they must be in focus. With the increasing importance of global warming and social awareness, ship manufacturing industry should behave in parallel with the new rules. International organizations, such as International Maritime Organization (IMO), and several governments brought strict rules to reduce the emissions to an acceptable level. Besides, innovative and effective technologies are developed by some companies under the support of international organizations and national authorities. In this study, we aimed to investigate the current regulations and emission reduction technologies. Annual emission footprint estimation is calculated in order to remark the potential danger of shipping emissions. Two methodologies are used for calculations, namely, fuel consumption approach and engine power approach. Emission factors are taken from three different studies. In fuel consumption approach, the total emission amounts were 10115.7 and 9213.7 tons (according to Cooper and Gustafsson {[}35] as well as Eyring et al. {[}18] emission factors). For engine power approach, three different results are reached: 11503.1, 11191.2 and 11546.4 tons of Cooper and Gustafsson {[}35], Eyring et al. [}18] and CALEPA {[}36] emission factors.

TI  - Feasibility analysis of an innovative naval on-board power-train system with hydrogen- based PEMFC technology
AB  - The maritime transportation sector is one of the main contributors to global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM), hazardous air pollutants, NOX and SOX. In particular, it is estimated that the CO2 emissions in this sector are about 1 Gt every year. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted stringent emission limits in its Tier III regulation, most notably on NOX and SOX emissions and pledged to reach a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipments by at least 50% by the year 2050, compared to 2008 emissions. For emission control areas (ECAs) these requirements are particularly strict and will be difficult to meet with traditional diesel engines and bunker fuels. Therefore, ship owners need to adopt solutions to bring emissions within these and other future limits by means of environmentally friendly fuels and high efficiency propulsion technologies. In this context, hydrogen and fuel cells play a crucial role, thanks to their low criteria pollutant and GHG emission. This paper presents a techno-economic feasibility study for replacing the conventional diesel engine powertrain, usually employed in Ro-Pax ferries, with an innovative system based on polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technology. The ferry is actually powered by four diesel engines, which deliver a total output of 37.8 MW. The ferry also has two auxiliary engines which give an output of 4.0 MW and also two 2.0 MW bow thrusters for its manoeuvring. The energy analysis has allowed to define the hydrogen consumption for each cruise, as well as the optimal size of the innovative propulsion system. In particular, The PEMFC powertrain is sized at the same maximum power output as the main diesel engine and, thanks to the modular architecture of fuel cells and their flexible performance at partial load, the auxiliary engines are not contemplated. Moreover, in order to identify the best solution in terms of ship's weight and space requirements, two hydrogen storage solutions based on compressed hydrogen technology and liquefied hydrogen technology, have been analyzed and compared. The economic assessment has been carried out by estimating the CAPEX and OPEX for each H2 storage technology by considering short-term, mid-term and long-term scenarios (from 2020 to 2050).

TI  - ENERGY EFFICIENCY DESIGN INDEX AND CO2 REDUCTION TREND ASSESSMENT FOR TURKISH FLAGGED SHIPS
AB  - International Maritime Organization(IMO) has adopted the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) in 1.January.2013 for all new ships above 400 GT, in order to set technical practices to ensure ship energy efficiency management. With this move IMO stipulated global ship fleet to become more efficient and less CO2 emitting by meeting the requirements of EEDI measures, through three phases until 2050. In this context, this study has analyzed the potential of EEDI and CO2 reduction for 405 Turkish Flagged (TF) Ships to understand the current and prospective state of energy efficiency level of Turkish Fleet up to 2025.

TI  - Waste heat recovery steam systems techno-economic and environmental investigation for ocean-going vessels considering actual operating pro files
AB  - Waste heat recovery steam systems is a proven technology for improving the ship power plant efficiency and reducing the ship environmental footprint, thus their usage can respond to the pressure for decarbonising the shipping operations. This study aims at investigating the techno-economic feasibility of various waste heat recovery steam systems whilst assessing their environmental impact for three ocean-going tanker vessels with their type spanning from Handymax size to very large crude carriers. Thermodynamic modelling of the investigated systems is employed for estimating the systems performance parameters including the generated electric power and fuel savings taking into account the vessels actual operating profiles and typical annual voyages characteristics. The systems net present value and the profitability index indicators are employed for assessing the systems economic feasibility, whereas the systems environmental impact is evaluated by using the achieved annual carbon dioxide emissions reduction. Two different nominal turbo-generator sizes matching the ship main engine full-load and part-load conditions are investigated, whereas a sensitivity analysis on the fuels prices is carried out to identify the marginal fuel price that renders the investment of each investigated system profitable. The derived results demonstrate that the single pressure waste heat recovery system sized for the ship engine part-load operation provides an attractive solution depending on the vessel type considering the technical, economic and environmental parameters. This study results in better insights on the impacts of the investigated energy efficiency improvement technologies for tanker ships, thus it can prove useful support for designing future sustainable ship power plants.

TI  - Probability of achieving the energy efficiency index by Monte Carlo simulation
AB  - IMO is introducing two different emission indexes for a vessel: the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI). Both EEDI and EEOI will be probably used as part of a levy scheme to force the maritime sector to significantly reduce the carbon footprint. At present do exist few ports and/or states applying fees based on ship emissions. The reliability of a regular shipping service, or service reliability, defined as the probability to complete the link within schedule, is an important parameter that greatly influences commercial aspects, as well as the ship carbon footprint. In this paper the authors present a procedure to evaluate the EEOI indicator by Monte Carlo simulation, estimating the total ship fuel consumption as a function of the random variables displacement and speed. A complete series of operating data concerning two years of navigation, for a commercial trade in the Mediterranean Sea, were collected and used to validate the code.

In this work, two case vessels were considered for analysis, a Roll-On-Roll-Off ship and a harbour tug boat. Actual sailing operational profiles were used as the basis for energy considerations to assess the potential for lower emissions. An energy-centric simulation model was built to estimate the emission of various pollutants, considering different machinery set-ups. Results have shown that savings are possible, especially for vessels which run on residual fuels, where auxiliary drives provide a way of exploiting the advantages of cleaner sources for manoeuvring instances.

Increasingly the benefits of reduced engine emissions both for climate change and pollution legislation reasons are also a strong influence,.. With the continuing upward trend of fuel costs, all those means by which fuel consumption can be reduced needs consideration This paper presents a range of energy saving technologies in the context of BMT's own Product Tanker design. The study seeks to show, from an independent viewpoint, how they might be applied to achieve the real financial and environmental benefits. The consequences for machinery performance is identified along with consideration of the parasitic loads such features can require. The estimated acquisition and implementation costs are compared with the benefits to the ship's resultant in-service costs to show how the choice of an energy saving solution needs to be considered in conjunction with the ship's overall design, its machinery and its operating role.

TI  - A Novel Big Data Collection System for Ship Energy Efficiency Monitoring and Analysis Based on BeiDou System
AB  - The call for green shipping is increasing, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from ships becomes more and more important. Traditional ship energy efficiency monitoring is based on the noon reports, which are susceptible to human error and have a time delay. Many ship energy efficiency monitoring systems have been designed and developed, but they usually cannot send data to the shore in time. In order to identify abnormal fuel consumption in time, this paper realizes a big data collection system for ship energy efficiency monitoring based on the BeiDou System. The system installed on two sister container ships has already collected a lot of data. Big data analysis methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation analysis, are applied in the system to realize data visualization and analysis. Using PCA, it turns out that the shaft power of the main engine is related to a certain ship speed, which is also affected by load and weather conditions, and is the biggest factor in determining fuel consumption. To realize the assessment of hull fouling and the optimization of ship trim, a useful physics-based analysis is proposed. The analysis shows that the fouling of ship body greatly increases its resistance. Our analysis method can also find the best trim under specific loading condition. All these points are important for reducing fuel consumption and improving ship efficiency.

In this line, the Global Maritime Energy Efficiency Partnerships was launched. GloMEEP has the purpose of fostering a reduction in the emissions through the adoption and implementation of energy efficiency measures. With the aim of providing a tool for costs and benefits analysis of these energy efficiency measures, DNV GL developed an interactive spreadsheet for IMO. The tool is meant to provide an assessment of the impact of the various possible energy efficiency measures. It computes the effects of these technical operational measures on both the EEDI and the EEOI, and also the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve. In the present paper, use, results and potential of the model have been exploited by using input data derived from the specific segment of cruise vessels. Â© 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

TI  - A variable DC approach to minimize drivetrain losses in fuel cell marine power systems
AB  - This paper presents a method of operating a zero-emission power system in marine vessels. The main goal of the proposed method is to reduce losses of drivetrain devices. The power sources considered in this work are proton exchange membrane fuel cell and lithium-ion battery while the main power consumers are induction motors driven propulsion system. Both sources and consumers are connected to a common DC bus through power conversion devices. In the proposed method, the DC bus voltage level is controlled according to the loading of the fuel cells. By controlling the DC bus voltage, it allows operation of fuel cell DC/DC converter in freewheeling mode which significantly reduces the converter losses. In addition, this approach is also expected to reduce the motor and battery drive losses. Feasibility of the proposed operation method and loss calculations are presented on a real-time hardware-in-loop simulator consisting of real control units and virtual power device models.

TI  - Influence of Low-Speed Marine Diesel Engine Settings on Waste Heat Availability
AB  - The low-speed marine diesel engine is the most effective of all the ship propulsion systems. On every ship there is a need for thermal energy besides mechanical power to drive the propeller. It is possible to install a heat exchanger in the exhaust system that makes use of waste heat of the exhaust gasses of the diesel engine. Such a combined mechanical and thermal energy generation is called cogeneration. Modern engines allow the variation of the fuel injection timing and the variation of the exhaust valve timing, which results in a great usage flexibility. In the current work a computer simulation model of a low-speed marine diesel engine is presented. The exhaust gas heat energy available to power a heat exchanger was calculated. The time of the beginning of fuel injection and the time of the opening of the exhaust valve was varied. It was analyzed how these parameters influence the power, the fuel consumption, the engine efficiency, the exhaust gas temperature, the heat energy available in the exhaust gasses, the overall efficiency of the cogeneration system, and the power to heat ratio.

AB  - Electrification of vessel power and propulsion system has been widely utilized in the shipbuilding industry in recent years. It is expected to be adopted in all marine vessel segments as the increasingly strict marine greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions regulations push the maritime fleet to decrease its reliance on conventional fuels such as marine diesel oil (MDO). With the development of sustainable energy sources and energy storage technologies, such as fuel cells, batteries, and super-capacitors, these renewable energy sources are integrated into the marine electric power system to reduce or even achieve zero-emission operation. A comprehensive shipboard power system model is thecrucial foundation for the further research. In this paper, a hybrid shipboard power configuration will be studied and modeled using Matlab/Simulink. The detailed model using average converters' models for the ship power system will be described.

TI  - Methodology for rating the operational energy effciency performance of ships in the context of global climate governance
AB  - In a joint effort to address global climate change, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has considered imposing a regulatory regime on the operational energy effciency of ships to complement the existing mandatory mechanism on design effciency. However, the random and uncertain nature of the operational energy effciency of ships poses a signifcant challenge to performance regulation. In this paper, a quantile regression model, with dummy variables representing the observation calendar years, is applied to quantify the level, the scale and the skewness of the distribution of the operational carbon intensity performance of international shipping. A rating mechanism is further constructed on this basis, which is able to guide the performance of international shipping as a whole in line with the levels of ambition, whilst being robust to certain individual deviations. This rating mechanism is demonstrated using the bulk feet of China as a sample, which shows its competency as a systematic solution for scientifc evaluation of the operational energy effciency of ships.

TI  - Cost-effective planning and abatement costs of battery electric passenger vessel services
AB  - This paper analyzes the energy replacement potential for high-speed passenger vessels. Emphasis is on whether better planning of services can mitigate technical and economic barriers to zero emission transport. A novel Mixed-Integer Programming problem for battery electric vessel services that jointly minimizes operator and passenger costs subject to strategic (fleet selection and land-based infrastructure location), tactical (frequency), and operational decisions (sailing pattern) is proposed. The planning problem is utilized to estimate technology replacement potential and associated costs for two existing services/routes in Norway and based on four hypothetical demand scenarios derived from the same two services. The results showcase that constraints related to battery range and charging limit the replacement potential and make energy conservation more pertinent. Abatement cost estimates range between 3 000 and 18 000 NOK per ton CO2, placing them well above the social cost of carbon calculated at 2 000 NOK per ton by 2030.

TI  - A model for estimating the carbon footprint of maritime transportation of Liquefied Natural Gas under uncertainty
AB  - The demand for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) in the global markets has changed significantly. As a result, industries have been forced to consider investing significantly in supply chains to achieve an efficient distribution of LNG for cost efficiency and carbon footprint reduction. To minimize the contribution of LNG maritime transportation to global climate change, there is a need to quantify the carbon footprints systematically. In this research, we developed a novel and practical model for estimating the carbon footprint for LNG maritime transport. Using the MATLAB program, an uncertainty-based carbon footprint accounting framework is created. The Monte Carlo simulation model is built to conduct a carbon footprint analysis while the main input parameters were changed within a reliable range. Later, a multivariate sensitivity analysis is performed using the Risk Solver software to estimate the most significant parameters on the net carbon footprints. The sensitivity analysis results showed that that steam process day and steaming fuel consumption are found to be the most sensitive parameters for the overall carbon footprint for both Laden and Ballast trips. Furthermore, it was found that the Q-Max vessel produces more carbon emissions when compared to the Q-Flex, although both are traveling the same distance and are using the same fuel type. The type of fuel is also significantly affecting the emission values due to the relevant carbon content in the fuel. Like the case of the two conventional vessels, the one that is running with the only LNG is found to have fewer emissions when compared to the one run with dual-mode. Â© 2021

TI  - Cost assessments of ship main propulsion and service power options
AB  - With the increase of greenhouse-gas regulation in marine vessels, more attention has been paid to the energy saving and carbon reduction problems. Main propulsion and service power systems that cause emissions and result in significant fuel oil costs are among the major energy saving and carbon reduction problems. Better fuel efficiency and cleaner emissions alternatives for main propulsion and ship service power, that provide different improvement levels, can be used to match individual owner's special needs. Cost effective analysis is essential and important when considering the economic competitiveness of these alternatives. In order to provide accurate cost analysis results, a set of cost analysis model for ship main propulsion and service generator systems is proposed in this paper. A present value method is used to consider capital cost and operational & maintenance costs in the economic life of equipment in the analysis. Several possible propulsion and electrical power generation options are studied by using ship practical data. To reduce effects of uncertain parameters on analysis result and determine critical parameters, sensitive analyses are also performed. The model developed can assist owners in establishing a business case for currently available or further ship powering and electrical generator systems.

AB  - The new regulations regarding ship emissions based on IMO regulations combined to the high fuel prices require the application of new technologies to improve ship efficiency and to reduce the CO2, NOX, SOX and BC emissions. The application of LNG as fuel and battery packs to improve the conventional engines performance are already a reality in offshore supply vessels (OSV) around the world. However, the reduction in OPEX and payback time of the additional investment is very dependent of the ship operational profile, which are related to the FPSOs and port facilities particularities in Brazil. In order to estimate the advantages of these technologies in the PSV overall performance several different simulators regarding DP operation, sailing, waiting and anchored mode are combined to obtain a digital twin of the vessel. These simulators are combined to the real data monitored from the ships regarding ship speed, position and heading collected in Brazil based on AIS/AIS-Sat database. This database is combined to the environmental conditions regarding wave, current and wind obtained based on global numerical models to provide the environmental loads acting in the ship during the different stages of the operation. The DP simulations are performed applying a thrust allocation algorithm, the calm water resistance is obtained based on regression models and the added resistance due to waves are computed based on strip theory. The forces are converted into electric load by considering the propeller, generators, switchboard, electric drive and engine efficiency curves combined to a power management system (PMS) algorithm, which balance the loads in the engines according to the operational mode. The baseline for comparison is the current PSV without dual-fuel engines or battery pack. Â© 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.
