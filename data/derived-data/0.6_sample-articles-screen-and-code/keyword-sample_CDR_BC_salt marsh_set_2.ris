TI  - The economic feasibility of Blue Carbon cooperation in the South China Sea region
AB  - Coastal Blue Carbon is the carbon stored in mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass meadows. There is an urgent need to protect the coastal ecosystem by developing Blue Carbon economy. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility and mechanism of the Blue Carbon cooperation in the South China Sea Region (SCSR) from an economic angle. We utilize the paradigm of Cobb-Douglas production to stimulate Blue Carbon development and mathematically prove the feasibility of such a cooperation strategy. The Shapley value in game theory is further applied, which not only confirms the reality of this cooperation but also provides an allocation mechanism of the cooperation benefits. The results suggest that there exists a profitable opportunity for the Blue Carbon cooperation in the SCSR. Further discussion and suggestions are provided in promotion of research focus on the Blue Carbon cooperation. Â© 2019

TI  - Hypersaline tidal flats as important ``blue carbon{''} systems: a case study from three ecosystems
AB  - Hypersaline tidal flats (HTFs) are coastal ecosystems with freshwater deficits often occurring in arid or semiarid regions near mangrove supratidal zones with no major fluvial contributions. Here, we estimate that organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were buried at rates averaging 21 (+/- 6), 1.7 (+/- 0.3) and 1.4 (+/- 0.3) gm(-2) yr(-1), respectively, during the previous century in three contrasting HTF systems, one in Brazil (eutrophic) and two in Australia (oligotrophic). Although these rates are lower than those from nearby mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass systems, the importance of HTFs as sinks for OC, TN and TP may be significant given their extensive coverage. Despite the measured short-term variability between net air-saltpan CO2 influx and emission estimates found during the dry and wet season in the Brazilian HTF, the only site with seasonal CO2 flux measurements, the OC sedimentary profiles over several decades suggest efficient OC burial at all sites. Indeed, the stable isotopes of OC and TN (delta C-13 and delta N-1(5)) along with C : N ratios show that microphytobenthos are the major source of the buried OC in these HTFs. Our findings highlight a previously unquantified carbon as well as a nutrient sink and suggest that coastal HTF ecosystems could be included in the emerging blue carbon framework.

TI  - Climate and anthropogenic controls on blue carbon sequestration in Hudson River tidal marsh, Piermont, New York
AB  - Tidal marshes globally are experiencing erosion with sea level rise. In order to adaptively plan for essential marsh preservation, we recognize the importance of the investigation of marsh archives for the perspective they provide toward resilience. Our objective in this study is to examine the relationship of tidal marsh carbon sequestration with both climate change and human impact throughout past centuries and millennia. A Hudson River marsh sediment core spanning the last 2000 years is analyzed for bulk loss on ignition (LOI), bulk density, sedimentation rate, carbon (C) and mineral flux, and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis including lead, copper, titanium and potassium. We compare this record to previously established pollen and spore stratigraphy from the same site, along with an extensive macrofossil based AMS 14C chronology based upon both cores. Carbon accumulation generally follows sediment accumulation rates, which were higher than 200 g C m-2 yr-1 prior to 1500 years ago. Declines in carbon storage rate during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) are linked to drought, fire, and charcoal, while lesser declines during the Little Ice Age (LIA) are linked to cooling and a shorter growing season. Subsequent human impact with marsh haying practices also led to carbon accumulation rate decline to 100 g C m-2 yr-1. Increases in C sequestration rates in recent decades may be attributable to nitrogen pollution of the estuary, invasive plants, and/or increased flooding, but the lack of mineral sediment threatens their stability. Ecosystem function is declining with the loss of foundational species, and the crisis is deepening for preservation of this habitat. We strongly recommend strategies for minimizing marsh loss.

TI  - Carbon stocks, sequestration, and emissions of wetlands in south eastern Australia
AB  - Nontidal wetlands are estimated to contribute significantly to the soil carbon pool across the globe. However, our understanding of the occurrence and variability of carbon storage between wetland types and across regions represents a major impediment to the ability of nations to include wetlands in greenhouse gas inventories and carbon offset initiatives. We performed a large-scale survey of nontidal wetland soil carbon stocks and accretion rates from the state of Victoria in south-eastern Australiaa region spanning 237,000km(2) and containing >35,000 temperate, alpine, and semi-arid wetlands. From an analysis of >1,600 samples across 103 wetlands, we found that alpine wetlands had the highest carbon stocks (290 +/- 180 Mg C-org ha(-1)), while permanent open freshwater wetlands and saline wetlands had the lowest carbon stocks (110 +/- 120 and 60 +/- 50 Mg C-org ha(-1), respectively). Permanent open freshwater sites sequestered on average three times more carbon per year over the last century than shallow freshwater marshes (2.50 +/- 0.44 and 0.79 +/- 0.45 Mg C-org ha(-1)year(-1), respectively). Using this data, we estimate that wetlands in Victoria have a soil carbon stock in the upper 1m of 68 million tons of C-org, with an annual soil carbon sequestration rate of 3 million tons of CO2 eq. year(-1)equivalent to the annual emissions of about 3\% of the state's population. Since European settlement (similar to 1834), drainage and loss of 260,530ha of wetlands may have released between 20 and 75 million tons CO2 equivalents (based on 27\%-90\% of soil carbon converted to CO2). Overall, we show that despite substantial spatial variability within wetland types, some wetland types differ in their carbon stocks and sequestration rates. The duration of water inundation, plant community composition, and allochthonous carbon inputs likely play an important role in influencing variation in carbon storage.

TI  - Fingerprinting Blue Carbon: Rationale and Tools to Determine the Source of Organic Carbon in Marine Depositional Environments
AB  - Blue carbon is the organic carbon in oceanic and coastal ecosystems that is captured on centennial to millennial timescales. Maintaining and increasing blue carbon is an integral component of strategies to mitigate global warming. Marine vegetated ecosystems (especially seagrass meadows, mangrove forests, and tidal marshes) are blue carbon hotspots and their degradation and loss worldwide have reduced organic carbon stocks and increased CO2 emissions. Carbon markets, and conservation and restoration schemes aimed at enhancing blue carbon sequestration and avoiding greenhouse gas emissions, will be aided by knowing the provenance and fate of blue carbon. We review and critique current methods and the potential of nascent methods to track the provenance and fate of organic carbon, including: bulk isotopes, compound-specific isotopes, biomarkers, molecular properties, and environmental DNA (eDNA). We find that most studies to date have used bulk isotopes to determine provenance, but this approach often cannot distinguish the contribution of different primary producers to organic carbon in depositional marine environments. Based on our assessment, we recommend application of multiple complementary methods. In particular, the use of carbon and nitrogen isotopes of lipids along with eDNA have a great potential to identify the source and quantify the contribution of different primary producers to sedimentary organic carbon in marine ecosystems. Despite the promising potential of these new techniques, further research is needed to validate them. This critical overview can inform future research to help underpin methodologies for the implementation of blue carbon focused climate change mitigation schemes.

TI  - Tidal freshwater forest accretion does not keep pace with sea level rise
AB  - Soil properties, accretion, and accumulation were measured in tidal freshwater forests (tidal forests) of the Ogeechee, Altamaha, and Satilla rivers of the South Atlantic (Georgia USA) coast to characterize carbon (C) sequestration and nutrient (nitrogen-N, phosphorus-P) accumulation in these understudied, uncommon, and ecologically sensitive wetlands. Carbon sequestration and N and P accumulation also were measured in a tidal forest (South Newport River) that experiences saltwater intrusion to evaluate the effects of sea level rise (SLR) and saltwater intrusion on C, N and P accumulation. Finally, soil accretion and accumulation of tidal forests were compared with tidal fresh, brackish and salt marsh vegetation downstream to gauge how tidal forests may respond to SLR. Soil accretion determined using C-137 and Pb-210 averaged 1.3 and 2.2 mm yr(-1), respectively, and was substantially lower than the recent rate of SLR along the Georgia coast (3.0 mm yr(-1)). Healthy tidal forest soils sequestered C (4982 g m(-2) yr(-1)), accumulated N (3.25.3 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and P (0.290.56 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and trapped mineral sediment (340650 g m(-2) yr(-1)). There was no difference in long-term accretion, C sequestration, and nutrient accumulation between healthy tidal forests and tidal forests of the South Newport River that experience saltwater intrusion. Accelerated SLR is likely to lead to decline of tidal forests and expansion of oligohaline and brackish marshes where soil accretion exceeds the current rate of SLR. Conversion of tidal forest to marshes will lead to an increase in the delivery of some ecosystem services such as C sequestration and sediment trapping, but at the expense of other services (e.g. denitrification, migratory songbird habitat). As sea level rises in response to global warming, tidal forests and their delivery of ecosystem services face a tenuous future unless they can migrate upriver, and that is unlikely in most areas because of topographic constraints and increasing urbanization of the coastal zone.

TI  - Declines of methylmercury along a salinity gradient in a low-lying coastal wetland ecosystem at South Carolina, USA
AB  - Wetlands are widely regarded as biogeochemical hotspots of highly toxic methylmercury (MeHg), mainly mediated by sulfate-reducing bacteria. In low-lying coastal wetlands, sea level rise, a phenomenon caused by global climate change, is slowly degrading numerous healthy freshwater forested wetlands into salt-degraded counterparts with a nickname â€œghost forestsâ€, and eventually converting them to saltmarshes. However, little is known about the changes of mercury (Hg) methylation, bioaccumulation, and biomagnification along the forest-to-saltmarsh gradient. Here, we conducted extensive field sampling in three wetland states (healthy forested wetlands, salt-degraded forested wetlands, and saltmarsh) along a salinity gradient (from 0 to 9.4 ppt) in Winyah Bay, South Carolina, USA. We found that in our study wetland systems the saltmarshes had the lowest levels of both total Hg and MeHg in sediments and biota, as compared to healthy forested wetlands and saltwater-degraded ghost forests. Our results suggest that the slow conversion of forested wetland to saltmarsh could reduce net MeHg production in our study wetland systems, which we hypothesized that could be attributed to increased sulfate reduction and excessive buildup of sulfide in sediment that inhibits microbial Hg methylation, and/or reduced canopy density and increased photodegradation of MeHg. However, it should be noted that biogeochemical MeHg responses to salinity changes may be site-specific and we urge more similar studies in other wetland systems along a salinity gradient. Therefore, long-term salinization of coastal wetlands and the slow conversion of forests to marshes could decrease long-term exposure of toxic MeHg levels in coastal food webs that are similar to our system, and ultimately reduce human exposure to this neurotoxin.

TI  - Ecological parameter reductions, environmental regimes, and characteristic process diagram of carbon dioxide fluxes in coastal salt marshes
AB  - We investigated the ecological parameter reductions (termed ``similitudes{''}) and characteristic patterns of the net uptake fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) in coastal salt marshes using dimensional analysis method from fluid mechanics and hydraulic engineering. Data collected during May-October, 2013 from four salt marshes in Waquoit Bay and adjacent estuary, Massachusetts, USA were utilized to evaluate the theoretically-derived dimensionless flux and various ecological driver numbers. Two meaningful dimensionless groups were discovered as the light use efficiency number (LUE=CO2 normalized by photosynthetically active radiation) and the biogeochemical number (combination of soil temperature, porewater salinity, and atmospheric pressure). A semi-logarithmic plot of the dimensionless numbers indicated the emergence of a characteristic diagram represented by three distinct LUE regimes (high, transitional, and low). The high regime corresponded to the most favorable (high temperature and low salinity) condition for CO2 uptake, whereas the low regime represented an unfavorable condition (low temperature and high salinity). The analysis identified two environmental thresholds (soil temperature similar to 17 degrees C and salinity similar to 30 ppt), which dictated the regime transitions of CO2 uptake. The process diagram and critical thresholds provide important insights into the CO2 uptake potential of coastal wetlands in response to changes in key environmental drivers.

TI  - Coastal wetland ecosystems deliver large carbon stocks in tropical Mexico
AB  - Tropical wetlands are important in the global carbon (C) cycle and climate system. To elaborate government policies that protect wetland ecosystem services, spatially explicit data on the existing C stocks are needed. This study quantified above and below ground C stocks in mangrove, swamp forests, marshes, and grazed wetlands in three different regions in Mexico (Veracruz, Tabasco/Campeche, and Chiapas states), using a combination of remote sensing techniques and field data collection. We report a 0.688 Gt C stock in the areas investigated showing that these wetlands hold important C stocks. The total C stock of Mexico's wetlands is expected to be considerably larger as our study is not a complete survey of Mexico's total wetland area. Across the three regions, the currently unprotected swamp forests and marshes had substantial peat deposits storing approximate to 0.232 and 0.375 Pg C, respectively. The high C stocks found in swamp forests (1801 +/- 283 Mg C ha(-1)) and marshes (1100 +/- 376 Mg C ha(-1)) are likely to be vulnerable to human interventions such as drainage. Flooded grasslands, used for grazing, had substantially lower C storage (271 +/- 122 Mg C ha(-1)), showing that grazed areas are less effective as C stores. Across sites the belowground C pool that was two orders of magnitude greater than the aboveground biomass C stocks. Carbon storage in wetland vegetation types differed among the three study regions, indicating the need for developing government policies considering a specific regional approach to protect the C stocks of coastal wetlands. Given that freshwater swamps had the greatest C stocks and freshwater marshes stored most C, these wetland peat deposits should be prioritized for conservation, via new legislation or inclusion in payment for ecosystem services schemes.

TI  - Tidal effects on ecosystem CO2 exchange in a Phragmites salt marsh of an intertidal shoal
AB  - Understanding the mechanisms and controlling factors of ecosystem CO2 exchange in tidal wetlands is of great benefit for research concerning the global carbon cycle and climate change. In spite of this, the multiple controls of ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 exchange in coastal wetlands subject to subdaily tidal flooding have yet to be adequately addressed. In this study, we investigated the tidal influence on ecosystem CO2 exchange in a Phragmites salt marsh of an intertidal shoal in the Changjiang estuary, based on eddy covariance (EC) measurements. The results revealed that the study area acted as a strong sink for atmospheric CO2 (net ecosystem exchange, NEE = -901 g C m(-2)) in 2018. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), air temperature (T-a), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were major drivers of NEE on both diel and multi-day scales. The fides, along with the bio-meteorological variables, strongly affect ecosystem photosynthesis (gross primary production, GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco) in the tidal wetland, especially on the multi-day scale. Regardless of which flux partitioning method was utilized, tidal inundation generally imposed inhibitory effects on GPP, which were directly attributed to tidal water level (TWL) and salinity. The daytime data-based estimates of R-eco was also suppressed on average under the tidal inundation condition when T-a was higher relative to the non-inundation condition, reflecting the influence of TWL on R-eco and the reduced sensitivity of R-eco to T-a. We observed that NEE responded positively or negatively to tidal flooding, depending on the magnitude of tidal suppression on GPP and R-eco. When T-a was roughly between 28 and 32 degrees C and PAR was > 1200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), GPP was suppressed by fides more than R-eco during the early and rapid vegetative stage, while during the peak vegetative stage, the opposite was true. This study not only shows the unique impact of tidal salt marsh wetlands on carbon uptake, but it also represents an example of a coastal wetland in which tidal inundation promotes the net uptake of CO2.

TI  - Responses of soil respiration to simulated groundwater table and salinity fluctuations in tidal freshwater, brackish and salt marshes
AB  - Hydrological and salinity fluctuations in coastal wetlands induced by climatic change (e.g., drought) and anthropogenic activities can significantly affect the blue carbon sink via soil respiration (CO2 emissions). However, little information is available on the interactive effects of the groundwater table and salinity on soil respiration in coastal wetlands. Here, in situ soil columns were collected from tidal freshwater wetlands, brackish wetlands, and salt marshes to conduct a simulated assessment of the effects of fluctuations in the groundwater table (âˆ’30 cm, âˆ’20 cm and âˆ’10 cm) and salinity (0 ppt, 12ppt, and 26 ppt) on soil respiration in the field. The results showed that soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands (0.56â€“2.1 Î¼mol/m2/s) and salt marshes (0.19â€“2.02 Î¼mol/m2/s) was higher than that in brackish wetlands (0.17â€“0.9 Î¼mol/m2/s) in all groundwater table and salinity treatments. The diurnal variation in soil respiration in the three simulated wetlands showed a unimodal curve, while the peak time was influenced by the groundwater table and salinity, with the maximum occurring at 11 a.m.-2 p.m. Soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands and brackish wetlands was significantly higher in the deep (âˆ’30 cm) and medium (âˆ’20 cm) groundwater table treatments than in the shallow (âˆ’10 cm) groundwater table treatment (p &lt; 0.05) and significantly higher in the low (0 ppt) and medium (12ppt) salinity treatments than in the high (26 ppt) salinity treatment (p &lt; 0.05). However, soil respiration in salt marshes decreased significantly as the groundwater table and salinity increased (p &lt; 0.05). The groundwater table and salinity exhibited significant interactive effects on soil respiration in brackish wetlands (p &lt; 0.05) and salt marshes (p &lt; 0.01). Additionally, significantly negative correlations were observed between soil respiration and groundwater table and salinity in three wetlands (p &lt; 0.05). Soil respiration in the three wetlands was significantly and positively correlated with microbial biomass carbon (p &lt; 0.05) and significantly and positively correlated with soil organic carbon and total nitrogen (p &lt; 0.01). The findings of this work can help reduce the uncertainty of model to accurately estimate carbon cycling of coastal wetlands at local, regional and global scales, and improve the blue carbon sink of coastal wetlands by regulating the groundwater table and salinity levels in wetland restoration projects.

TI  - Blue carbon effects of mangrove restoration in subtropics where Spartina alterniflora invaded
AB  - Mangrove swamps and salt marshes are noted for their large carbon sequestration and storage capacity. In southeastern China, mangrove transplantation is conducted as ecological restoration where exotic Spartina alterniflora (hereafter Spartina) is removed. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of mangrove trans-plantation on carbon sink potential. We analyzed chronological sediment accretion, soil carbon sequestration, and carbon storage of mangroves and Spartina on Maoyan and Ximen islands. Results showed that on both islands mangroves and invasive Spartina stored 12.7\%-31.4\% more carbon than bare mudflats over top meter soils, with Spartina outperforming restored mangroves. Both restored mangroves and invasive Spartina enhanced sediment accretion, but this enhancement was minimal in high sediment supply areas like Maoyan. Spartina invasion improved carbon sequestration capacity compared to bare mudflats in Maoyan, but mangrove restoration failed. In low sediment supply areas like Ximen, restored mangroves have outperformed Spartina invasion on carbon sequestration enhancement since >5 years of planting. Thus, carbon sink potential of mangrove restoration depended on sediment supply and time, with sediment supply being more important. We suggested that it was preferable to conduct mangrove restoration with Spartina eradication in low sediment supply areas in subtropics.

TI  - Non-conservative behavior of dissolved organic carbon in a Georgia salt marsh creek indicates summer outwelling
AB  - Salt marshes are highly productive ecosystems that efficiently accumulate carbon. However, it remains unclear how much carbon is exported from salt marshes (i.e., outwelled) through creeks as dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Addressing this uncertainty is critical for quantifying net carbon accumulation and determining the role marshes play in broader coastal carbon cycles. Consequently, this study sought to quantify net DOC fluxes through Groves Creek, the tidally-driven main creek channel of Groves Creek salt marsh on the Georgia coast (USA). To do this, near-continuous records of water flux, salt flux, and DOC flux were determined in Groves Creek's primary creek channel at 10-min resolution over 16 months. At our study site, we found that generally more water flowed onto the marsh through Groves Creek's primary creek channel during flood tide than left this route during ebb tide. The remaining unsampled water balance was assumed to leave the marsh via secondary marsh channels and over the marsh edge. Due to this limitation, the conservative nature of salt was utilized alongside flow and DOC to determine net DOC trends in Grove Creek's primary creek channel. Cumulative net DOC-salt relationships are linear for most of the study, indicating DOC largely behaved conservatively in the creek channel and wider marsh system. However, a period of non-conservative behavior in which the cumulative net DOC:salt ratio decreased indicated net DOC outwelling (4.1-30.1 g DOC m(- 2) y(-1)) during summer 2014. Results indicate DOC outwelling events, as observed here, may occur in pulses during highly productive summer months. Resolving these ``hot `` moments of DOC export at high-temporal resolution across larger salt marsh ecosystems is required to assess the true extent and quantitative significance of DOC outwelling to coastal carbon cycles and ecology.

TI  - LargeCO(2)release and tidal flushing in salt marsh crab burrows reduce the potential for blue carbon sequestration
AB  - Abundant crab burrows in carbon-rich, muddy salt marsh soils act as preferential water flow conduits, potentially enhancing carbon transport across the soil-water interface. With increasing recognition of blue carbon systems (salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrass) as hotspots of soil carbon sequestration, it is important to understand drivers of soil carbon cycling and fluxes. We conducted field observations and flow modeling to assess how crab burrows drive carbon exchange over time scales of minutes to weeks in an intertidal marsh in South Carolina. Results showed that continuous advective porewater exchange between the crab burrows and the surrounding soil matrix occurs because of tidally driven hydraulic gradients. The concentrations of dissolved inorganic (DIC) and organic (DOC) carbon in crab burrow porewater differ with that in the surrounding soil matrix, implying a diffusive C flux in the low-permeability marsh soil. Gas-phase concentrations of CO(2)in similar to 300 crab burrows were approximately six times greater than ambient air. The estimated total C export rate via porewater exchange (1.0 +/- 0.7 g C m(-2)d(-1)) was much greater than via passive diffusion transport (6.7 +/- 2 mg C m(-2)d(-1)) and gas-phase CO(2)release (1.8 mg C m(-2)d(-1)). The burrow-related carbon export was comparable to the regional salt marsh DIC export, groundwater-derived DIC export, and the net primary production previously estimated using ecosystem-scale approaches. These insights reveal how crab burrows modify blue carbon sequestration in salt marshes and contribute to coastal carbon budgets.

TI  - Estuarine submerged aquatic vegetation habitat provides organic carbon storage across a shifting landscape
AB  - Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) thrives across the estuarine salinity gradient providing valuable ecosystem services. Within the saline portion of estuaries, seagrass areas are frequently cited as hotspots for their role in capturing and retaining organic carbon (C-org). Non-seagrass SAV, located in the fresh to brackish estuarine areas, may also retain significant soil C-org, yet their role remains unquantified. Given rapidly occurring landscape and salinity changes due to human and natural disturbances, landscape level carbon pool estimates from estuarine SAV habitat blue carbon estimates are needed. We assessed C-org stocks in SAV habitat soils from estuarine freshwater to saline habitats (interior deltaic) to saline barrier islands (Chandeleur Island) within the Mississippi River Delta Plain (MRDP), Louisiana, USA. SAV habitats contain C-org stocks equivalent to those reported for other estuarine vegetation types (seagrass, salt marsh, mangrove). Interior deltaic SAV C-org stocks (231.6 +/- 19.5 Mg C-org ha(-1)) were similar across the salinity gradient, and significantly higher than at barrier island sites (56.6 +/- 10.4 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Within the MRDP, shallow water SAV habitat covers up to an estimated 28,000 ha, indicating that soil C-org storage is potentially 6.4 +/- 0.1 Tg representing an unaccounted C-org pool. Extrapolated across Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico, this represents a major unaccounted pool of soil C-org. As marshes continue to erode, the ability of coastal SAV habitat to offset someof the lost carbon sequestration may be valuable. Our estimates of C-org sequestration rates indicated that conversion of eroding marsh to potential SAV habitat may help to offset the reduction of C-org sequestration rates. Across Louisiana, we estimated SAV to offset this loss by as much as 79,000Mg C yr(-1) between the 1960s and 2000s. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Carbon sequestration in back-barrier tidal marsh soils
AB  - Tidal marshes are broad flat wetlands that have some of the highest carbon stocks of any ecosystem. Although the amount of carbon stored in these soils is undeniable, there are a number of uncertainties regarding carbon sequestration rates of these systems. One of the timeliest is related to the usefulness of a single sequestration rate for carbon accounting purposes. We measured soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rates across an elevation gradient in three back-barrier tidal marshes in New England to test if a single sequestration value can be used for such marshes. Time zero was marked by deposition of overwash sediments from Hurricane Sandy in 2012. A total of 52 sampling locations were established at the three marshes. Eight years after overwash deposition, average plant cover ranged from 55 to 94%. Soils developed thin A horizons over underlying overwash C horizons. Sequestration rates ranged from 52 to 637Â g carbon mâˆ’2yrâˆ’1. These rates are three to four times that of the average SOC sequestration rate in New England forests. Sequestration rates increased as elevation decreased (p values were.006,.020, and.16 for the three marshes). Average SOC sequestration rates for the lowest elevation marshes (296 and 326Â g mâˆ’2Â yrâˆ’1) were significantly higher than that of the higher elevation marsh (186Â g mâˆ’2Â yrâˆ’1). Our studies suggest that there is a significant elevation relationship in carbon sequestration within marshes, and a single sequestration rate is not representative of all marshes in similar settings.

TI  - Self-organized sulfide-driven traveling pulses shape seagrass meadows
AB  - Seagrasses provide multiple ecosystem services and act as intense carbon sinks in coastal regions around the globe but are threatened by multiple anthropogenic pressures, leading to enhanced seagrass mortality that reflects in the spatial self-organization of the meadows. Spontaneous spatial vegetation patterns appear in such different ecosystems as drylands, peatlands, salt marshes, or seagrass meadows, and the mechanisms behind this phenomenon are still an open question in many cases. Here, we report on the formation of vegetation traveling pulses creating complex spatiotemporal patterns and rings in Mediterranean seagrass meadows. We show that these structures emerge due to an excitable behavior resulting from the coupled dynamics of vegetation and porewater hydrogen sulfide, toxic to seagrass, in the sediment. The resulting spatiotemporal patterns resemble those formed in other physical, chemical, and biological excitable media, but on a much larger scale. Based on theory, we derive a model that reproduces the observed seascapes and predicts the annihilation of these circular structures as they collide, a distinctive feature of excitable pulses. We show also that the patterns in field images and the empirically resolved radial profiles of vegetation density and sediment sulfide concentration across the structures are consistent with predictions from the theoretical model, which shows these structures to have diagnostic value, acting as a harbinger of the terminal state of the seagrass meadows prior to their collapse.

TI  - Dublin's saltmarshes contain climate-relevant carbon pools
AB  - Wetland ecosystems, particularly coastal vegetated ecosystems, play a vital role in climate mitigation and adaptation. Coastal vegetated habitats (including coastal wetlands such as seagrass meadows, saltmarshes, and mangroves) are some of the most efficient ecosystems for storing carbon on a per hectare basis, retaining organic carbon for centuries to millennia. We conducted carbon stock assessments, to a depth of 1 m, across four young saltmarsh sites and the adjacent mudflats in Dublin, Ireland. Soil cores and vegetation samples were taken across each site in order to analyze the carbon content of each carbon pool. The carbon density of Dublin's saltmarshes was 112.1 +/- 10.1 Mg C-org ha(-) (1). The dominant plant species were Spartina anglica, Plantago maritima, and Atriplex portulacoides. The soil carbon pool of these saltmarshes contributes 87\% to the total carbon stock, with living plant biomass contributing the remaining 13\%. Saltmarshes are important ecosystems for climate mitigation and can provide nature-based solutions to reduce net carbon emissions; however, their degradation will lead to the loss of climate-relevant carbon pools.

However, the dynamic changes in community structure and abiotic environments in these regenerated marsh after seawall reclamation are largely unknown. We analyzed the seasonal changes of soil nutrient pools and the direction effects on them. The results showed that soil total nitrogen (TN) has decreased but soil organic carbon (SOC) has increased from May to September. Direction has influenced the patterns and seasonal changes in soil TN and SOC. The potential influencing factors have been largely contributed to soil salinity reduction, vegetation growth, microorganism activities with different seasonal characteristics. Researches on seasonal dynamic of marsh regeneration after seawall reclamation can provide us helpful information to understand mechanism of marsh restoration and design coastal marsh restoration projects.

TI  - Reclamation of coastal salt marshes promoted carbon loss from previously-sequestered soil carbon pool
AB  - Coastal salt marshes have recently been identified as important components of `blue carbon' sinks, will continue to maintain C accumulation for millennia, but have been seriously lost or degraded worldwide mainly owing to land reclamation. Most work to date has concentrated on the effects of habitat conversion or destruction on C sequestration potential, while relatively less attention has been put on their impacts on large standing soil C pool (previously sequestered and stored soil C) associated with salt marshes. Here, we provide direct empirical evidence to determine reclamation effects on previously sequestered soil C pool in salt marshes after nine years following reclamation. Our results showed that soil moisture significantly decreased and soil microbial biomass significantly increased along with the transition from salt marshes to reclaimed lands. Meanwhile, soil respiration was three-folds higher in reclaimed lands than in salt marshes. Consequently, soil organic C pool in reclaimed lands declined to 60\% (0-20 cm) and 79\% (0-100 cm) of those in salt marshes after nine years. We may speculate that half-life of topsoil C pool of salt marshes after reclamation is approximately 10 years, and previously sequestered and stored soil C pool may decline to the minimum value within roughly 15 years. Our results suggest that a considerable proportion of previously sequestered soil C, once effectively `locked up' in salt marshes mainly due to anaerobic conditions, is vulnerable to saltmarsh habitat loss and can be rapidly released into the atmosphere (as CO2) contributing to global warming within a short period after reclamation.

TI  - Resource stoichiometry, vegetation type and enzymatic activity control wetlands soil organic carbon in the Herbert River catchment, North-east Queensland
AB  - Wetlands are highly productive ecosystem with great potential to store carbon (C) and retain nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in their soil. Changes in vegetation type and land use can affect organic matter inputs and soil properties. This work aimed to examine how these changes affected elemental stoichiometry and C-, N-, and P- associated enzyme activities and wetland soil organic C stock. We quantified organic C concentrations, and stoichiometric ratios of C, N, and P in total and microbial biomass pools, along with the activities and ratios of C-, N-, and P-associated enzymes for soils of natural coastal wetlands with different vegetation types, namely Melaleuca wetland (Melaleuca spp), mangrove forests (Bruguiera spp), and saline marsh (Eleocharis spp). We also compared these natural wetlands to an adjacent sugarcane plantation to understand the effects of vegetation types. Hypothesis-oriented path analysis was used to explore links between these variables and soil organic C stocks. Tidal forested soils (0â€“30 cm) had the highest organic C, N, and P contents and potential activities of C-, N-, P- acquiring enzymes, compared with other vegetation types. Mangroves soils had the highest total soil C:N and microbial biomass C:P ratios. Microbial biomass C:P ratios were significantly and positively related to total C:P, while microbial biomass N:P ratios were positively associated with total soil C:P and N:P ratios. Path analysis suggested that soil organic C stock was largely explained by total C:P ratio, microbial biomass N:P ratios, total P content, and the ratio of C- and P-associated enzymes. Different types of wetlands have different soil properties and enzymatic activities, implying their different capacity to store and process C and N. The resource quality and stoichiometry direct influence the organic C stock. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Global blue carbon accumulation in tidal wetlands increases with climate change
AB  - Coastal tidal wetlands produce and accumulate significant amounts of organic carbon (C) that help to mitigate climate change. However, previous data limitations have prevented a robust evaluation of the global rates and mechanisms driving C accumulation. Here, we go beyond recent soil C stock estimates to reveal global tidal wetland C accumulation and predict changes under relative sea level rise, temperature and precipitation. We use data from literature study sites and our new observations spanning wide latitudinal gradients and 20 countries. Globally, tidal wetlands accumulate 53.65 (95\%CI: 48.52-59.01) Tg C yr(-1), which is similar to 30\% of the organic C buried on the ocean floor. Modeling based on current climatic drivers and under projected emissions scenarios revealed a net increase in the global C accumulation by 2100. This rapid increase is driven by sea level rise in tidal marshes, and higher temperature and precipitation in mangroves. Countries with large areas of coastal wetlands, like Indonesia and Mexico, are more susceptible to tidal wetland C losses under climate change, while regions such as Australia, Brazil, the USA and China will experience a significant C accumulation increase under all projected scenarios.

TI  - Seagrass ecosystems: Contributions to and mechanisms of carbon sequestration
AB  - The ocean's vegetated habitats, in particular seagrasses, mangroves and salt marshes, each capture and store a comparable amount of carbon per year, forming the Earth's blue carbon sinks, the most intense carbon sinks on the planet. Seagrass meadows, characterized by high prima-ry productivity, efficient water column filtration and sediment stability, have a pronounced capacity for carbon sequestration. This is enhanced by low decomposition rates in anaerobic seagrass sediments. The carbon captured by seagrass meadows contributes significantly to the total blue carbon. At a global scale, seagrass ecosystems are carbon sink hot spots and have profound influences on the global carbon cycle. This importance combined with the many other functions of seagrass meadows places them among the most valuable ecosystems in the world. Unfortunately, seagrasses are declining globally at an alarming rate owing to anthropogenic disturbances and climate change, making them also among the most threatened ecosystems on the Earth. The role of coastal systems in carbon sequestration has received far too little attention and thus there are still many uncertainties in evaluating carbon sequestration of global seagrass meadows accurately. To better assess the carbon sequestration of global seagrass ecosystems, a number of scientific issues should be considered with high priorities: 1) more accurate measurements of seagrass coverage at national and global levels; 2) more comprehensive research into species-and location-specific carbon sequestration efficiencies; 3) in-depth exploration of the effects of human disturbance and global climate change on car-bon capture and storage by seagrass ecosystems.

TI  - Restoring coastal plants to improve global carbon storage: Reaping what we sow
AB  - Long-term carbon capture and storage (CCS) is currently considered a viable strategy for mitigating rising levels of atmospheric CO2 and associated impacts of global climate change. Until recently, the significant below-ground CCS capacity of coastal vegetation such as seagrasses, salt marshes, and mangroves has largely gone unrecognized in models of global carbon transfer. However, this reservoir of natural, free, and sustainable carbon storage potential is increasingly jeopardized by alarming trends in coastal habitat loss, totalling 30-50% of global abundance over the last century alone. Human intervention to restore lost habitats is a potentially powerful solution to improve natural rates of global CCS, but data suggest this approach is unlikely to substantially improve long-term CCS unless current restoration efforts are increased to an industrial scale. Failure to do so raises the question of whether resources currently used for expensive and time-consuming restoration projects would be more wisely invested in arresting further habitat loss and encouraging natural recovery.

TI  - Process Controls of the Live Root Zone and Carbon Sequestration Capacity of the Sundarbans Mangrove Forest, Bangladesh
AB  - The conservation of coastal wetland ecosystems, like mangrove forests and salt marshes, represents a critical strategy for mitigating atmospheric emissions and climate change in the 21st century. Yet the existence of these environments is threatened by human-induced disturbances, namely deforestation and accelerated sea-level rise. Coastal systems maintain surface elevation in response to sea-level rise through a combination of physical and biological processes both above and below the ground surface. The quantification and relative contribution of belowground process controls (e.g., seasonal water content, organic matter decomposition) on surface elevation change is largely unexplored but crucial for informing coastal ecosystem sustainability. To address this knowledge deficit, we integrated measurements of surface elevation change of the live root zone (0.5 to 1 m depth) with geotechnical data from co-located sediment cores in the Sundarbans mangrove forest (SMF) of southwest Bangladesh. Core data reveal that the primary belowground controls on surface elevation change include seasonal fluctuations in pore-water content and the relative abundance of fine-grained sediments capable of volumetric expansion and contraction, supporting an elevation gain of ~2.42 Â± 0.26 cm yearâˆ’1. In contrast to many mangrove environments, the soils of the SMF contain little organic matter and are dominantly composed (&gt;90%) of inorganic clastic sediments. The mineral-rich soil texture likely leads to less compaction-induced subsidence as compared to organic-rich substrates and facilitates surface equilibrium in response to sea level rise. Despite a relatively high soil bulk density, soil carbon (C) density of the SMF is very low owing to the dearth of preserved organic content. However, rates of C accumulation are balanced out by locally high accretion rates, rendering the SMF a greater sink of terrestrial C than the worldwide mangrove average. The findings of this study demonstrate that C accumulation in the SMF, and possibly other alluvial mangrove forests, is highly dependent on the continued delivery of sediment to the mangrove platform and associated settings.

TI  - Net primary productivity and carbon sequestration potential of salt marsh vegetation in Chongming Dongtan of the Yangtze Estuary based on CASA model [åŸºäºŽ CASA æ¨¡åž‹çš„é•¿æ±Ÿå£å´‡æ˜Žä¸œæ»©æ¹¿åœ°æ¤è¢«å‡€åˆçº§ç”Ÿäº§åŠ›ä¸Žå›ºç¢³æ½œåŠ›]
AB  - Wetland ecosystems have strong carbon storage and sequestration abilities, playing an important role in global carbon cycle. To understand the carbon sequestration capacity of salt marsh wetlands, we estimated net primary productivity based on field investigation and remote sensing in a typical tidal creek system in the southern Chongming Dongtan Wetland. The carbon sequestration potential of salt marsh wetlands under environmental change was also estimated. The results showed that net primary productivity of halophytes exhibited significant temporal and spatial variations. The temporal variations were mainly reflected in the inter-annual differences and seasonal differences. The total net primary productivity of salt marsh in 2013 and 2017 was 245.70 and 257.75 t CÂ·a-1, respectively, showing a slight increase. The net primary productivity in summer (97.70Â±69.31 g C m-2Â·month-1) was significantly higher than that in other seasons (P&lt;0.05). At the spatial scale, net primary productivity decreased with elevation and Phragmites australis cohorts (1079.64Â±168.34 g C m-2Â·a-1) had significantly higher net primary productivity than other cover types (P&lt;0.05). In 2017-2018, the carbon sequestration capacity of salt marshes in the study area was lower than the average level of carbon sequestration capacity of terrestrial vegetation in the same area. As the marsh matures gradually, carbon sequestration capacity can be further improved. Under the background of sea level rise, the positive succession of salt marsh vegetation compensates for the organic carbon loss caused by the erosion of salt marsh edge. The total carbon sequestration potential increased by 130.24-250.12 tÂ·a-1. The continuous rise of global temperature and the changes of estuarine environment, such as sea level rise, shoreline erosion, vegetation succession and human disturbance, increase the uncertainty of salt marsh carbon sequestration ability. Prediction of its contribution to carbon cycle will provide scientific support for carbon sequestration and increasing carbon sinks. Â© 2022 editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Ecology.

TI  - Changes in Ecosystem Nitrogen and Carbon Allocation with Black Mangrove (Avicennia germinans) Encroachment into Spartina alterniflora Salt Marsh
AB  - Increases in temperature are expected to facilitate encroachment of tropical mangrove forests into temperate salt marshes, yet the effects on ecosystem services are understudied. Our work was conducted along a mangrove expansion front in Louisiana (USA), an area where coastal wetlands are in rapid decline due to compounding factors, including reduced sediment supply, rising sea level, and subsidence. Marsh and mangrove ecosystems are each known for their ability to adjust to sea-level rise and support numerous ecosystem services, but there are some differences in the societal benefits they provide. Here, we compare carbon and nitrogen stocks and relate these findings to the expected effects of mangrove encroachment on nitrogen filtration and carbon sequestration in coastal wetlands. We specifically evaluate the implications of black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) encroachment intoSpartina alterniflora-dominated salt marsh. Our results indicate that black mangrove encroachment will lead to increased aboveground carbon and nitrogen stocks. However, we found no differences in belowground (that is, root and sediment) nitrogen or carbon stocks between marshes and mangroves. Thus, the shift from marsh to mangrove may provide decadal-scale increases in aboveground nitrogen and carbon sequestration, but belowground nitrogen and carbon sequestration (that is, carbon burial) may not be affected. We measured lower pore water nitrogen content beneath growing mangroves, which we postulate may be due to greater nitrogen uptake and storage in mangrove aboveground compartments compared to marshes. However, further studies are needed to better characterize the implications of mangrove encroachment on nitrogen cycling, storage, and export to the coastal ocean.

TI  - Seasonal Species Variation of Sediment Organic Carbon Stocks in Salt Marshes of Tuticorin Area, Southern India
AB  - Increasing attention in global blue carbon investigation in these contemporary times, salt marsh has the distinctive importance in coastal ecosystems. We examined sediment organic carbon stock in the four dominant salt marsh species areas viz. Suaeda maritima, Sesuvium portulacastrum, Arthrocnemum indicum, and Salicornia brachiata from Tuticorin, southeast coast of India in two seasons i.e. dry (July 2015) and wet season (January 2016). We examined above ground (AGB) and below ground biomass (BGB), sediment physico-chemical properties like pH, BD, composition, OM\%, C-org\%, C and N\%, sediment organic carbon stocks (SOCS) and multivariate analysis on studied variables. Maximum AGB was recorded in A. indicum in both dry and wet season (10.91 +/- 0.15g/cm(2) and 14.87 +/- 0.68g/cm(2)). The highest BGB was observed in S. maritima in both seasons, as 2.01 +/- 0.35g/cm(2) and 4.49 +/- 0.35g/cm(2), respectively. The OM percentage ranged between 4.13 +/-.083 and 7.23 +/-.088\% and the highest was observed in the wet season from S. maritima. Sediment organic stocks (Mgha (-1)) ranged from 8.42 +/-.640 to 54.46 +/- 1.46Mgha (-1) reflects nearly 7 times higher than the dry season. The present study can be useful for the estimation of blue carbon budgets in tropical coastal ecosystem since this type was the first hand information from this area.

TI  - Large-scale predictions of salt-marsh carbon stock based on simple observations of plant community and soil type
AB  - Carbon stored in coastal wetland ecosystems is of global relevance to climate regulation. Broadscale inventories of this "blue" carbon store are currently lacking and labour intensive. Sampling 23 salt marshes in the United Kingdom, we developed a Saltmarsh Carbon Stock Predictor (SCSP) with the capacity to predict up to 44 % of spatial variation in surface soil organic carbon (SOC) stock (0-10 cm) from simple observations of plant community and soil type. Classification of soils into two types (sandy or not-sandy) explained 32 % of variation in SOC stock. Plant community type (five vegetation classes) explained 37 % of variation. Combined information on soil and plant community types explained 44 % of variation in SOC stock. GIS maps of surface SOC stock were produced for all salt marshes in Wales (~4000 ha), using existing soil maps and governmental vegetation data and demonstrating the application of the SCSP for large-scale predictions of blue carbon stores and the use of plant community traits for predicting ecosystem services.

TI  - Modelling predictive changes of blue carbon due to sea-level rise using InVEST model in Chilaw Lagoon, Sri Lanka
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems such as mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds, are vital for mitigating climate change owing to their high capacity for carbon capture and storage. Sea-level rise (SLR), as a result of climate change, poses a severe threat to these ecosystems due to the proximity of these ecosystems to coastal margins and, thus, modelling how blue carbon within these ecosystems will respond to SLR scenarios will prove vital to the effective management and conservation of these ecosystems. The Chilaw lagoon in Sri Lanka is home to considerably small and highly disturbed mangrove forests (422.92Â ha) where the blue carbon dynamics of the lagoon are poorly studied. The primary objective of this study was to model and predict the possible changes to blue carbon in the Chilaw lagoon owing to the impact of SLR, making use of the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST 3.11.0) Coastal Blue Carbon Model. Carbon storage, carbon accumulation, carbon emissions, net carbon sequestration, and valuation of net carbon sequestration were modelled considering four SLR scenarios relating to Shared Socioeconomic Pathways indicated in the 6th assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for years 2100 and 2150. The only blue carbon land-use land cover (LULC) identified was the mangrove forest. The present blue carbon stock in the ecosystem was found to be 991.52Â MgC and it is predicted to be 2049.93Â MgC in the year 2100. In the year 2150, the influence of SLR is evident and carbon stocks are predicted to decrease with increasing extents of inundation. Total carbon sequestration (2021â€“2150), the monetary value of carbon sequestration in 2150, and carbon accumulation (2100â€“2150) were all predicted to decrease with rising sea levels. Emissions of carbon were found to increase with the increasing level of disturbance owing to SLR. The study represents the first time the InVEST model was utilized to model blue carbon dynamics in Sri Lanka and indicates the possible changes to blue carbon in the Chilaw lagoon and quantifies it as well.

TI  - Wetland Soil Co-2 Efflux Along a Latitudinal Gradient of Spatial and Temporal Complexity
AB  - Foundation plant species play an important functional role in modifying microenvironment through vegetation structure and by influencing soil properties. Mangroves and salt marsh differ in vegetation structure, yet offer similar ecosystem services. This work aimed to understand how different vegetation classes and abiotic factors along a latitudinal gradient of spatial and temporal complexity affect soil CO2 efflux. Soil CO2 efflux, biomass, soil properties, and soil and air temperature were measured in July 2015 and January 2016 in situ at 10 sites along a 342-km latitudinal gradient on the Atlantic coast of Florida. Mean CO2 flux values ranged from 0.41 +/- 0.19 to 2.03 +/- 0.19molm(-2)s(-1) across vegetation classes, and efflux values in mangrove plots were not significantly different between sampling dates, whereas ecotone and salt marsh efflux values were. On average, CO2 flux was 1.11 +/- 0.18molm(-2)s(-1) greater in July than in January across plots. There was no significant trend between efflux and aboveground biomass and a positive trend between belowground biomass and CO2 efflux. Edaphic parameters (organic matter content (\%), soil N, organic C, and pH) were comparable across all vegetation class soils and there was a positive trend between soil temperature and flux. Soil efflux had an inverse relationship with latitude; in January, there is an increase in efflux with a decrease in latitude, while in July, efflux increases with an increase in latitude. Consequently, we assert that differences in CO2 efflux were due to soil temperature and species productivity along the latitudinal gradient studied.

TI  - Coastal vegetation invasion increases greenhouse gas emission from wetland soils but also increases soil carbon accumulation
AB  - Soil properties and soil-atmosphere fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O from four coastal wetlands were studied throughout the year, namely, native Kandelia obovata mangrove forest vs. exotic Sonneratia apetala mangrove forest, and native Cyperus malaccensis salt marsh vs. exotic Spartina alterniflora salt marsh. Soils of the four wetlands were all net sources of greenhouse gases while Sonneratia forest contributed the most with a total soil-atmosphere CO2-equivalent flux of 137.27mgCO2m-2h-1, which is 69.23%, 99.75% and 44.56% higher than that of Kandelia, Cyperus and Spartina, respectively. The high underground biomass and distinctive root structure of Sonneratia might be responsible for its high greenhouse gas emission from the soil. Soils in Spartina marsh emitted the second largest amount of total greenhouse gases but it ranked first in emitting trace greenhouse gases. Annual average CH4 and N2O fluxes from Spartina soil were 13.77 and 1.14Î¼molm-2h-1, respectively, which are 2.08 and 1.46 times that of Kandelia, 1.03 and 1.15 times of Sonneratia, and 1.74 and 1.02 times of Cyperus, respectively. Spartina has longer growing season and higher productivity than native marshes which might increase greenhouse gas emission in cold seasons. Exotic wetland soils had higher carbon stock as compared to their respective native counterparts but their carbon stocks were offset by a larger proportion because of their higher greenhouse gas emissions. Annual total soil-atmosphere fluxes of greenhouse gases reduced soil carbon burial benefits by 8.1%, 9.5%, 6.4% and 7.2% for Kandelia, Sonneratia, Cyperus and Spartina, respectively, which narrowed down the gaps in net soil carbon stock between native and exotic wetlands. The results indicated that the invasion of exotic wetland plants might convert local coastal soils into a considerable atmospheric source of greenhouse gases although they at the same time increase soil carbon accumulation.

TI  - Changes in Sediment Organic Carbon Accumulation under Conditions of Historical Sea-Level Rise, Southeast Saline Everglades, Florida, USA
AB  - Mangroves can store more sediment organic carbon (SOC) than freshwater and salt marshes. Understanding how mangroves have responded to historical sea-level rise (SLR) is fundamental to assessing their resilience and capacity to store carbon as SLR accelerates. We quantified landscape-level temporal and spatial trends in historical coastal wetland sediment accumulation and associated SOC content (i.e., storage) along coastal-to-inland gradients in Southeast Florida. The observed trends were transgressive and attributed to the historical rise in sea level. Our results indicate an overall significant increase in the SOC content of the historic wetland sediment succession caused by the vertical accumulation and landward migration of carbon-rich mangrove-dominated plant communities (mean = 0.08 g cm(-3)) into and over carbon-poor wet prairie plant communities (mean = 0.02 g cm(-3)). The observed historical increase in SOC is predicted to diminish over time as the difference between rates of SLR and vertical sediment accumulation increases and because the landward migration of mangrove-dominated plant communities is now obstructed by a shore-parallel flood-control levee. These results are likely to unfold in other low-latitude coastal wetlands where they are sandwiched between rising seas and an urbanized landscape.

TI  - Plant size metrics and organic carbon content of Florida salt marsh vegetation
AB  - Carbon stored in soil and vegetative biomass in mangrove swamps, salt marshes, and seagrass flats (â€œcoastal blue carbonâ€) is a significant component of the coastal carbon budget due to the ability of these ecosystems to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide as plant biomass and peat. Growing interest in the protection of these essential yet vulnerable coastal ecosystems, as well as recognition of their capacity to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide, has led to the need for rapid and accurate quantification of location-specific coastal blue carbon stocks. This study provides allometric equations for the calculation of aboveground dry biomass based on plant height for 18 salt marsh species from Tampa Bay, Florida, USA. The 18 plant species were also analyzed for carbon and nitrogen content to determine the appropriate carbon conversion factor to use for blue carbon calculations. The salt marsh plants had an average of 1.2Â Â±Â 0.4% nitrogen and 41.1Â Â±Â 5.5% carbon. With the exception of Batis maritima, which had a carbon content of only 23.4%, carbon content for all other species ranged from 33.4â€“47.1%. The four most succulent plant species in this study contained an average of 33.3Â Â±Â 7.0% carbon, while the nine graminoid species contained 44.4Â Â±Â 2.0% carbon. These species-specific equations and carbon data provide non-destructive methods to rapidly quantify vegetative biomass and carbon stocks for monitoring efforts and blue carbon stock assessments.

TI  - Salt marsh ecosystem restructuring enhances elevation resilience and carbon storage during accelerating relative sea-level rise
AB  - Salt marshes respond to sea-level rise through a series of complex and dynamic bio-physical feedbacks. In this study, we found that sea-level rise triggered salt marsh habitat restructuring, with the associated vegetation changes enhancing salt marsh elevation resilience. A continuous record of marsh elevation relative to sea level that includes reconstruction of high-resolution, sub-decadal, marsh elevation over the past century, coupled with a lower-resolution 1500-year record, revealed that relative sea-level rose 1.5 Â± 0.4 m, following local glacial isostatic adjustment (1.2 mm/yr). As sea-level rise has rapidly accelerated, the high marsh zone dropped 11 cm within the tidal frame since 1932, leading to greater inundation and a shift to flood- and salt-tolerant low marsh species. Once the marsh platform fell to the elevation favored by low-marsh Spartina alterniflora, the elevation stabilized relative to sea level. Currently low marsh accretion keeps pace with sea-level rise, while present day high marsh zones that have not transitioned to low marsh have a vertical accretion deficit. Greater biomass productivity, and an expanding subsurface accommodation space favorable for salt marsh organic matter preservation, provide a positive feed-back between sea-level rise and marsh platform elevation. Carbon storage was 46 Â± 28 g C/m2/yr from 550 to 1800 CE, increasing to 129 Â± 50 g C/m2/yr in the last decade. Enhanced carbon storage is controlled by vertical accretion rates, rather than soil carbon density, and is a direct response to anthropogenic eustatic sea-level rise, ultimately providing a negative feedback on climate warming.

TI  - A comparison of soil carbon pools across a mangrove-salt marsh ecotone at the southern African warm-temperate range limit
AB  - Mangroves and salt marshes are globally recognized for their ability to efficiently sequester and store carbon in biomass and soil carbon pools. An increase in soil carbon has been found at range limits where mangroves are expanding along ecotones into salt marsh, as mangroves store more carbon per unit area. However, the magnitude of this trend is variable at different mangrove range limits depending on the rates of expansion and the local climatic and geomorphological factors that influence current mangrove distribution. This study presents the first account of soil carbon storage across a mangrove-salt marsh ecotone at the Nahoon Estuary, a warm-temperate range limit for the east coast of the African continent. Soil carbon (to 50 cm depth) was compared between mangrove, salt marsh, and a transitional ecotone habitat. We found that soil carbon was highest at 30-50 cm below the surface across all habitats. The average soil carbon in the upper 50 cm was similar in mangrove (110.14 MgC.ha(-1)), ecotone (114.50 MgC.ha(-1)), and salt marsh habitats (109.62 MgC. ha(-1)). These results show that although mangroves have expanded at the Nahoon Estuary over the past 50 years, the soil carbon content is still similar across the mangrove-salt marsh ecotone. This is in contrast to other studies from southern hemisphere mangrove range limits in Australia. However, these trends have been reported at northern hemisphere range limits in the USA. Further studies in this region are needed to identify environmental factors influencing soil carbon variability. (C) 2019 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of Spartina invasion on the soil organic carbon content in salt marsh and mangrove ecosystems in China
AB  - Coastal wetlands are large reservoirs of soil carbon (C) and have been invaded globally by the exotic species Spartina alterniflora. However, the effects of these invasions on soil C content remain unclear. We performed a meta-analysis of 2479 soil organic C (SOC) content observations collected from 91 field studies conducted in coastal China, the world's largest introduced range for S. alterniflora. Spartina alterniflora invasions had no significant effect on the SOC content in vegetated native wetlands in coastal China. S. alterniflora increased the SOC content in the top 30 cm of salt marshes after invading only one of the nine marsh types, which was dominated by a dwarf succulent species, Suaeda salsa in the northern subtropics and decreased the SOC content in the top 60 cm of mangroves dominated by Kandelia obovata and mixed communities after invasion in the southern subtropics. S. alterniflora invasions did not significantly affect the SOC content in the other salt marsh or mangrove ecosystems. Moreover, the SOC content in S. alterniflora-invaded ecosystems increased only on a decadal scale and then decreased, rather than increasing monotonically. Synthesis and applications. Our findings reveal that the SOC content of S. alterniflora-invaded ecosystems is similar to or lower than that of most native ecosystems. As soil bulk density is often reduced by S. alterniflora invasions, the C storage capabilities of vegetated native ecosystems might be substantially reduced after S. alterniflora invasions. Moreover, the SOC content in these invaded ecosystems gradually decreased after long-term S. alterniflora invasions (>20 years). Therefore, the displacement of native salt marsh or mangrove species by S. alterniflora may not be considered a natural climate solution to increase the C sink in coastal China. Future efforts are required to control S. alterniflora preferentially in coastal wetlands where S. alterniflora invasions do not increase the SOC content, and to conserve and restore native coastal wetlands, which are the core areas of the World Natural Heritage site serving as China's Migratory Bird Sanctuaries that have been severely threatened by S. alterniflora invasions, to increase ecological integrity and C sinks and to mitigate climate change.

TI  - Plum rain enhances porewater greenhouse gas fluxes and weakens the acidification buffering potential in saltmarshes
AB  - Seasonal rainfall, locally known as plum rain, is a potentially important driver of greenhouse gas dynamics in saltmarshes, but no studies of its effects have been reported. We quantified porewater exchange and related greenhouse gas fluxes in a saltmarsh over a spring-neap-spring tidal cycle (30 tidal cycles) during the plum rain season. Radon-traced porewater exchange rates were found to be 15.5 (pre-rain) and 24.8 (plum rain) cm dayâˆ’1, which released CO2 and CH4 to surface waters with the fluxes (mmol mâˆ’2 dayâˆ’1) of 77.7 and 0.28 during the pre-rain period and 132.3 and 0.63 over the plum rain period, respectively. The large amounts of soil CO2 export through porewater exchange during the plum rain significantly increased the CO2 inventory and reduced the pH from 8.06 to 7.86 (median) in saltmarsh surface water. The result suggests that plum rain-derived porewater exchange with lower pH values may contribute to coastal acidification. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Conservation of blue carbon ecosystems for climate change mitigation and adaptation
AB  - Emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), has been the main cause of climate change and global warming since the mid-20th century. Blue carbon (BC) ecosystems, which include tidal marshes, mangroves, and seagrass meadows, play a key role in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Despite occupying only 0.2% of the ocean surface, they contribute 50% of carbon burial in marine sediments, equivalent to the sequestration of 1%-2% of current global CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Conversely, damage to these ecosystems risks the release of that carbon back to the atmosphere. Conserving and restoring BC ecosystems not only maintains CO2 sequestration capacity but also services essential for climate change adaptation along coasts, including prevention of shoreline erosion. However, BC ecosystems rank among the most threatened ecosystems on earth. Urgent action is needed to prevent further degradation, to avoid additional greenhouse emissions, as well as restoring degraded habitats to recover their climate change mitigation potential.

TI  - Rapid recovery of carbon cycle processes after the cessation of chronic nutrient enrichment
AB  - Salt marshes provide critical ecosystem services including some of the highest rates of carbon storage on Earth. However, many salt marshes receive very high nutrient loads and there is a growing body of evidence indicating that this nutrient enrichment alters carbon cycle processes. While many restoration plans prioritize nutrient management in their efforts to conserve salt marsh ecosystems, there has been little empirical investigation of the capacity for carbon cycle processes to recover once nutrient loading is reduced. To address this, we compared rates of greenhouse gas fluxes (i.e., CO2 and methane) measured using static chambers, and soil organic matter decomposition, using both litter bags and the Tea Bag Index (TBI), during the last two years of a long-term, ecosystem-scale nutrient enrichment experiment (2015-2016) as well as in the first two years of recovery post-enrichment (2017-2018). We found that both ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and decomposition processes (i.e., rhizome decomposition and soil organic matter stabilization) were enhanced by nutrient enrichment, but returned to reference ecosystem levels within the first year following the cessation of nutrient enrichment and remained at reference levels in the second year. These results suggest that management practices intended to reduce nutrient loads in coastal systems may, in fact, allow for rapid recovery of carbon cycle processes, potentially restoring the high carbon sequestration rates of these blue carbon ecosystems.

TI  - Carbon stocks and accumulation rates in Red Sea seagrass meadows
AB  - Seagrasses play an important role in climate change mitigation and adaptation, acting as natural CO2 sinks and buffering the impacts of rising sea level. However, global estimates of organic carbon (C-org) stocks, accumulation rates and seafloor elevation rates in seagrasses are limited to a few regions, thus potentially biasing global estimates. Here we assessed the extent of soil C-org stocks and accumulation rates in seagrass meadows (Thalassia hemprichii, Enhalus acoroides, Halophila stipulacea, Thalassodendrum ciliatum and Halodule uninervis) from Saudi Arabia. We estimated that seagrasses store 3.4 +/- 0.3 kg C-org m(-2) in 1 m-thick soil deposits, accumulated at 6.8 +/- 1.7 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1) over the last 500 to 2,000 years. The extreme conditions in the Red Sea, such as nutrient limitation reducing seagrass growth rates and high temperature increasing soil respiration rates, may explain their relative low C-org storage compared to temperate meadows. Differences in soil C-org storage among habitats (i.e. location and species composition) are mainly related to the contribution of seagrass detritus to the soil C-org pool, fluxes of C-org from adjacent mangrove and tidal marsh ecosystems into seagrass meadows, and the amount of fine sediment particles. Seagrasses sequester annually around 0.8\% of CO2 emissions from fossil-fuels by Saudi Arabia, while buffering the impacts of sea level rise. This study contributes data from understudied regions to a growing dataset on seagrass carbon stocks and sequestration rates and further evidences that even small seagrass species store C-org in coastal areas.

TI  - Carbon sequestration in a pacific northwest eelgrass (zostera marina) meadow
AB  - Coastal wetlands are known to be efficient carbon sinks due to high rates of primary productivity, carbon burial by mineral sediments, and low rates of sediment organic matter decomposition. Of the three coastal wetland types: Tidal marshes, tidal forests, and seagrass meadows, carbon burial by seagrasses is relatively under-studied, and reported rates range widely from 45 to 190 g C m-2 yr-1. Additionally, most of these seagrass rates are biased toward tropical and subtropical species, particularly Posidonia oceanica, with few focused on Zostera marina, the most widespread species in the northern hemisphere. We measured sediment organic content, carbon content, and long-term accretion rates to estimate organic carbon stocks and sequestration rates for a Z. marina meadow in Padilla Bay, a National Estuarine Research Reserve in Washington. We found rates of carbon sequestration to be quite low relative to commonly reported values, averaging 9 to 11 g C m-2 yr-1. We attribute this to both low sediment organic content and low rates of accretion. We postulate here that Padilla Bay's low carbon sequestration capacity may be representative of healthy Z. marina meadows rather than an anomaly, and that Z. marina meadows have an inherently low carbon sequestration capacity because of the species' low tolerance for suspended sediment (which limits light availability) and sediment organic content (which leads to toxic sulfide levels). Further research should focus on measuring carbon sequestration rates from other Z. marina meadows, particularly from sites that exhibit, a priori, the potential for higher rates of carbon sequestration.

TI  - Response of salt-marsh carbon accumulation to climate change
AB  - About half of annual marine carbon burial takes place in shallow water ecosystems where geomorphic and ecological stability is driven by interactions between the flow of water, vegetation growth and sediment transport. Although the sensitivity of terrestrial and deep marine carbon pools to climate change has been studied for decades, there is little understanding of how coastal carbon accumulation rates will change and potentially feed back on climate. Here we develop a numerical model of salt marsh evolution, informed by recent measurements of productivity and decomposition, and demonstrate that competition between mineral sediment deposition and organic-matter accumulation determines the net impact of climate change on carbon accumulation in intertidal wetlands. We find that the direct impact of warming on soil carbon accumulation rates is more subtle than the impact of warming-driven sea level rise, although the impact of warming increases with increasing rates of sea level rise. Our simulations suggest that the net impact of climate change will be to increase carbon burial rates in the first half of the twenty-first century, but that carbon-climate feedbacks are likely to diminish over time.

TI  - Seasonal Variations in Dissolved Carbon Inventory and Fluxes in a Mangrove-Dominated Estuary
AB  - Two experiments were performed during the wet and dry seasons to quantify dissolved carbon dynamics and fluxes in the Shark River, a tidal estuary flowing through the largest contiguous mangrove forest in North America (Everglades National Park, Florida, USA). During these experiments, between 80\% and 87\% of the total dissolved carbon pool consisted of inorganic carbon (DIC). Carbon inputs from mangroves to the estuary were slightly higher during the wet season, whereas alkalinity inputs were comparable during the two experiments. Longitudinal dissolved carbon fluxes to the coastal ocean were slightly higher during the wet season (13.53 +/- 0.76 x 10(5) mol day(-1) during the wet and 11.70 +/- 0.32 x 10(5) mol day(-1) during the dry), whereas longitudinal alkalinity flux was comparable during both experiments (10.64 +/- 0.74 in the wet vs. 9.88 +/- 0.30 x 10(5) mol day(-1) during the dry season). Overall, DIC production in surface water, porewater, and groundwater was dominated by oxic mineralization of mangrove-derived organic matter and carbonate dissolution. Carbonate dissolution was the most important alkalinity production process in the system. The experiments show that regardless of the season and hydro-climatic conditions, Shark River receives large inputs of dissolved carbon from the upstream marsh, mangroves, and carbonate dissolution, and that per area, it exports a greater amount of dissolved carbon than many other mangrove-dominated estuaries in the world.

TI  - Temporal Changes in Seawater Carbonate Chemistry and Carbon Export from a Southern California Estuary
AB  - Estuaries are important subcomponents of the coastal ocean, but knowledge about the temporal and spatial variability of their carbonate chemistry, as well as their contribution to coastal and global carbon fluxes, are limited. In the present study, we measured the temporal and spatial variability of biogeochemical parameters in a saltmarsh estuary in Southern California, the San Dieguito Lagoon (SDL). We also estimated the flux of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total organic carbon (TOC) to the adjacent coastal ocean over diel and seasonal timescales. The combined net flux of DIC and TOC (FDIC + TOC) to the ocean during outgoing tides ranged from âˆ’ 1.8Â±0.5 Ã— 103 to 9.5Â±0.7 Ã— 103 mol C hâˆ’1 during baseline conditions. Based on these fluxes, a rough estimate of the net annual export of DIC and TOC totaled 10Â±4 Ã— 106 mol C yearâˆ’1. Following a major rain event (36Â mm rain in 3Â days), FDIC + TOC increased and reached values as high as 29.0Â Â± 0.7 Ã— 103 mol C hâˆ’1. Assuming a hypothetical scenario of three similar storm events in a year, our annual net flux estimate more than doubled to 25Â Â± 4 Ã— 106 mol C yearâˆ’1. These findings highlight the importance of assessing coastal carbon fluxes on different timescales and incorporating event scale variations in these assessments. Furthermore, for most of the observations elevated levels of total alkalinity (TA) and pH were observed at the estuary mouth relative to the coastal ocean. This suggests that SDL partly buffers against acidification of adjacent coastal surface waters, although the spatial extent of this buffering is likely small.

TI  - Sources of organic carbon in mangrove sediments: variability and possible ecological implications
AB  - Mangrove sediments from three different mangrove ecosystems (Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary in the Godavari Delta, Andhra Pradesh, India, and Galle and Pambala, south-west Sri Lanka) were analysed for their organic carbon content, elemental ratios (C:N) and carbon stable isotope composition. Organic carbon content (0.6 - 31.7\% dry weight), C/N ratios (7.0 - 27.3) and delta(13)C (between -29.4 and -20.6parts per thousand) showed a wide range of values. Lower stocks of organic carbon coincided with low C/N (atom) ratios and less negative delta(13)C values, indicating import of marine or estuarine particulate suspended matter. High organic carbon stocks coincided with high C/N ratios and delta(13)C values close, but not equal, to those of the mangrove vegetation. The variations observed in this study and published literature data could be adequately described by a simple two-end mixing model, whereby marine/estuarine suspended matter and mangrove litter were taken as end members. Thus, while in some mangrove ecosystems or vegetation zones, organic carbon stocks can be very high and are almost entirely of mangrove origin, there also appear to be cases in which deposited estuarine or marine suspended matter is the dominant source of organic carbon and nitrogen in mangrove sediments. This situation is remarkably similar to that observed in temperate salt marsh ecosystems where the importance of local vascular plant production to the sediment organic carbon pool is equally variable. The observed high variability in organic matter origin is thought to have a major impact on the overall carbon dynamics in intertidal mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - Above- and Belowground Biomass Allocation in Four Dominant Salt Marsh Species of the Eastern United States
AB  - Measurements of aboveground and belowground biomass allocations are important for characterization of structure and function in marsh ecosystems as various processes such as carbon sequestration, gas transport, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem resilience are affected by these allocations. We measured aboveground and belowground biomass, root and rhizome characteristics, leaf area index (LAI), and carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio of various tissues of four tidal marsh species in New Jersey by harvesting biomass during peak growing season. The aboveground biomasses for Spartina patens, S. alterniflora, Phragmites australis, and Distichlis spicata were 2.3, 2.2, 1.7 and 1.2Â kgÂ mâˆ’2, respectively. The ratio of belowground to aboveground biomass for S. alterniflora and D. spicata, harvested from a recently restored wetland were lower than in previous studies. LAI for S. alterniflora, D. spicata, P. australis, and S. patens were 8.4, 6.8, 4.8 and 3.7Â m2Â mâˆ’2, respectively. Diameter of rhizome and root, number of primary roots per node, root surface area to volume ratio, and C/N of various tissues varied with species. The measured above- and belowground biometric traits are crucial for a better understanding of carbon dynamics, and modeling greenhouse gas transport in marsh ecosystems.

TI  - Carbon Storages along a Climate Induced Coastal Wetland Gradient
AB  - Across the globe, coastal wetland vegetation distributions are changing in response to climate change. In the southeastern United States, increased winter temperatures have resulted in poleward range expansion of mangroves into pure salt marsh habitat. Climate change-induced expansion of mangroves into salt marsh will significantly alter carbon (C) storage capacity of these wetlands, which currently store the highest average C per land area among unmanaged terrestrial ecosystems. Total ecosystem C stocks were measured along a 342 km latitudinal gradient of mangrove - to - marsh dominance in Florida. Carbon stocks were quantified through measurements of above- and belowground biomass and soil C. Interior mangrove C stocks were greater than both salt marsh and ecotonal C stocks and soil C comprised the majority of each ecosystem C component (51-98\%). The wetlands investigated in this study cover 38,532 ha, and store an average of 215 Mg of C ha(-1). Currently, mangroves cover 31\% of the land area studied, storing 44\% of the total C, whereas salt marshes occupy 68\% of the wetland area and only store 55\% of the C. Total conversion of salt marsh to mangrove may increase C storage by 26\%, predominately due to increases in aboveground biomass.

TI  - Improved estimates on global carbon stock and carbon pools in tidal wetlands
AB  - Tidal wetlands are global hotspots of carbon storage but errors exist with current estimates on their carbon density due to the use of factors estimated from other habitats for converting loss-on-ignition (LOI) to organic carbon (OC); and the omission of certain significant carbon pools. Here we show that the widely used conversion factor (LOI/OC = 1.724) is significantly lower than our measurements for saltmarsh sediments (1.92 Â± 0.01) and oversimplifies the polynomial relationship between sediment OC and LOI for mangrove forests. Global mangrove OC stock in the top-meter sediment reaches 1.93 Pg when corrected for this bias, and is 20% lower than the previous estimates. Ecosystem carbon stock (living and dead biomass, sediment OC and inorganic carbon) is estimated at 3.7â€“6.2 Pg. Mangrove deforestation leads to carbon emission rates at 23.5â€“38.7 Tg yrâˆ’1 after 2000. Mangrove sediment OC stock has previously been over-estimated while ecosystem carbon stock underestimated.

TI  - The present state-of-the-art of blue carbon repository in India: a meta-analysis
AB  - The present study collated data on the Indian blue carbon repository (mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes) from peer-reviewed literature on carbon stock assessment. This meta-analysis indicated that the blue carbon ecosystems of India could have a collective carbon stock of 67.35 Tg C (mangroves, seagrass, and salt marsh accounting for 67 Tg C, 0.0630 Tg C, and 0.0049 Tg C, respectively). Several studies have ubiquitously measured the spatial extent of mangroves (similar to 4991 km(2)) and seagrasses (similar to 517 km(2)) in India; however, the salt marshes (290-1398 km(2)) have contradictions in estimates. The green payments against the blue carbon ecosystems of India can be as high as similar to 9.6 billion US \$, whereas the social cost of carbon sequestered by these ecosystems can vary between 0.47 and 5.43 billion US \$. The present study also identified the key research areas that require priority to minimize the uncertainties in blue carbon stock assessment to foster a robust ecosystem-based approach for climate change adaptation in the country. The study identified that less than half of the total mangrove habitats of India are yet to be sampled leaving a scope of substantial uncertainty in nationwide blue carbon estimates. The spatial extent of India's salt marshes is another aspect that needs to be delineated with a higher confidence level.

TI  - Allometry data and equations for coastal marsh plants
AB  - Coastal marshes are highly valued for ecosystem services such as protecting inland habitats from storms, sequestering carbon, removing nutrients and other pollutants from surface water, and providing habitat for fish, shellfish, and birds. Because plants largely determine the structure and function of coastal marshes, quantifying plant biomass is essential for evaluating these ecosystem services, understanding the biogeochemical processes that regulate ecosystem function, and forecasting tidal wetland responses to accelerated sea level rise. Allometry is a convenient and efficient technique for nondestructive estimation of plant biomass, and it is commonly used in studies of carbon and nitrogen cycles, energy flows, and marsh surface elevation change. We present plant allometry data and models developed for three long-term experiments at the Smithsonian Global Change Research Wetland, a brackish marsh in the Rhode River subestuary of the Chesapeake Bay. The dataset contains 9,771 measurements of stem height, dry mass, and (in 9638 cases) stem width across 11 plant species. The vast majority of observations are for Schoenoplectus americanus (8430) and Phragmites australis (311), with fewer observations for other common species: Amaranthus cannabinus, Atriplex patula, Iva frutescens, Kosteletzkya virginica, Polygonum hydropiper, Solidago sempervirens, Spartina alterniflora, Spartina cynosuroides, and Typha angustifolia. Allometric relationships take the form of linear regressions of biomass (transformed using the Box-Cox procedure) on either stem height and width, or on stem height alone. Allometric relationships for Schoenoplectus americanus were not meaningfully altered by elevated CO2, N enrichment, the community context, interannual variation in climate, or year, showing that a single equation can be used across a broad range of conditions for this species. Archived files include: (1) raw data used to derive allometric equations for each species, (2) reports and evaluations of the allometric equations we derived from the data, and (3) R code with which our derivations can be replicated. Methodological details of our experiments, data collection efforts, and statistical modeling are described in the metadata. The allometric equations can be used for biomass estimation in empirical and modeling studies of North American coastal wetlands, and the data can be used in ecological studies of terrestrial plant allometry.

TI  - Carbon accumulation and vertical accretion in a restored versus historic salt marsh in southern Puget Sound, Washington, United States
AB  - Few comparisons exist between vertical accretion (VA) and carbon accumulation rates (CARs) in restored versus historic (i.e. reference) marshes. Here, we compare these processes in a formerly diked, sparsely vegetated, restored salt marsh (Six Gill Slough, SG), whose surface is subsided relative to the tidal frame, to an adjacent, relatively pristine, historic salt marsh (Animal Slough, AS). Six sediment cores were collected at both AS and SG approximately 6 years after restoration. Cores were analyzed for bulk density (BD), \% loss of ignition, \% organic carbon, and Pb-210. We found that sharp changes in BD in surface layers of SG cores were highly reliable markers for the onset of restoration. The mean VA since restoration at SG (0.79 {[}SD = 0.29] cm/year) was approximately twice that of AS (0.41 {[}SD = 0.16] cm/year). In comparison, the VA at AS over 50 years was 0.30 (SD = 0.09) cm/year. VA consisted almost entirely of inorganic sediment at SG whereas at AS it was approximately 55\%. Mean CARs at SG were somewhat greater than at AS, but the difference was not significant due to high variability (SG: 81-210 g C m(-2) year(-1); AS: 115-168 g C m(-2) year(-1)). The mean CAR at AS over the past 50 years was 118 (SD = 23) g C m(-2) year(-1). This study demonstrates that a sparsely vegetated, restored salt marsh can quickly begin to accumulate carbon and that historic and restored marshes can have similar CARs despite highly divergent formation processes.

TI  - Root-zone carbon and nitrogen pools across two chronosequences of coastal marshes formed using different restoration techniques: Dredge sediment versus river sediment diversion
AB  - Coastal marshes have among the highest rates of soil carbon accumulation of any ecosystem on Earth, yet they are increasingly being lost due to high rates of relative sea-level rise, changes to their hydrology, and other natural and anthropogenic factors. To mitigate some of this wetland loss, restoration strategies in Louisiana have been focused on creating marshes using dredge spoil and diverting river flow into deteriorating wetland basins. Here, we aimed to compare these two different restoration approaches in terms of the development of soil carbon and nitrogen within the root zone (top 30 cm) by examining two chronosequences of newly formed marshes that span 32- and 25-year timeframes-one of which was a series of brackish, created marshes in the Chenier Plain (Sabine; marsh creation), and the other, a series of deltaic, tidal, freshwater marshes in the currently prograding Wax Lake Delta (WLD; sediment diversion). We also assessed the vegetation coverage and the relative chemical stability of the soil organic carbon and nitrogen (refractory versus labile) that has accumulated across these restoration sites. We observed that vegetation coverage initially increased more rapidly in the Sabine marshes, but it was similar to that in the WLD marshes by similar to 30 years post-establishment. Whereas the soil carbon pool reached similar quantities between the two chronosequences, it increased nearly twice as fast on average in WLD versus Sabine. The density of soil nitrogen closely tracked soil carbon in WLD, but it remained uniform across the Sabine marshes. Refractory soil carbon accounted for 59 +/- 12\% of the total soil carbon, and the refractory carbon pool increased at a rate that was similar between both chronosequences, despite the characteristic differences in salinity, nutrient input, plant species composition, and mineral sedimentation rates. Overall, our results suggest that marshes formed from sediment diversions in Louisiana have the potential to rival or outpace marshes created using dredge sediment in terms of vegetation and soil organic matter development.

TI  - Ecosystem Functions of Tidal Fresh, Brackish, and Salt Marshes on the Georgia Coast
AB  - We examined patterns of habitat function (plant species richness), productivity (plant aboveground biomass and total C), and nutrient stocks (N and P in aboveground plant biomass and soil) in tidal marshes of the Satilla, Altamaha, and Ogeechee Estuaries in Georgia, USA. We worked at two sites within each salinity zone (fresh, brackish, and saline) in each estuary, sampling a transect from the creekbank to the marsh platform. In total, 110 plant species were found. Site-scale and plot-scale species richness decreased from fresh to saline sites. Standing crop biomass and total carbon stocks were greatest at brackish sites, followed by freshwater then saline sites. Nitrogen stocks in plants and soil decreased across sites as salinity increased, while phosphorus stocks did not differ between fresh and brackish sites but were lowest at salty sites. These results generally support past speculation about ecosystem change across the estuarine gradient, emphasizing that ecosystem function in tidal wetlands changes sharply across the relatively short horizontal distance of the estuary. Changes in plant distribution patterns driven by global changes such as sea level rise, changing climates, or fresh water withdrawal are likely to have strong impacts on a variety of wetland functions and services.

TI  - Soil carbon and nitrogen storage in recently restored and mature native Scirpus marshes in the Yangtze Estuary, China: Implications for restoration
AB  - As part of research into the re-establishment of the native species Scirpus mariqueter in the salt marshes of the Yangtze Estuary, the roles of revegetation mode (planting density), site characteristics (sediment texture and hydrological regime) and community age (recently restored and mature marshes) in the storage of soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (SN) were examined. In recently restored marsh characterized by muddy sediments with moderate sediment accretion, vegetation growth and SOC and SN storage increased along with the increase in planting densities and the SOC storage was 1.14â€“1.52 times greater than that in non-vegetated plots after two years of revegetation. The SOC storage under a high planting density equated to approximately 75% of the carbon stock in the mature marsh. However, the increase in SOC storage was much less in those sites characterized by silty sediments than that in sites with muddy sediment, even when a high planting density was applied. This is attributed to a lower rate of sediment deposition and inhibition of below-ground root growth, which was found to be strongly correlated with carbon and nitrogen stocks in the soil. Additionally, the main rooting system of S. mariqueter and SOC and SN storage were concentrated in the top âˆ¼20Â cm in the recently restored marshes. These results demonstrate that successful vegetation restoration plays a key role in determining SOC and SN storage within a salt marsh. The restoration of native S. mariqueter for SOC and SN stocks is most effective when conducted in muddy sediments with good sedimentation rates and using a high planting density. In contrast, costs will be higher and recovery time longer in silty (or sandy) sediments, due to their poorer conditions for plant growth and significantly lower rates of carbon and nitrogen accumulation.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Estimation of Seagrass Percent Cover and LAI for Above Ground Carbon Sequestration Mapping
AB  - Seagrasses are distinct flowering plants which thrive underwater. They are part of a complex ecosystem that supports different forms of life. Recent studies found out that coastal wetlands - mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrass, are far more proficient in sequestering and storing carbon than terrestrial ecosystems. Although seagrasses occupy only 0.2\% of the area of the oceans, they sequester approximately 15\% of total carbon storage in the ocean. Several remote sensing techniques are available to map and monitor seagrasses but most of them focus only on extent and area coverage. To estimate the carbon sequestration of seagrass beds, aside from extent, other parameters are needed such as leaf area index, percent cover, density, biomass etc., However, there are limits in mapping seagrass parameters using remote sensing. The reflectance measured by sensors is affected by other factors such as water absorption, turbidity, dissolved organic matter, depth and phytoplankton which affects the backscattering of energy. In this study, different remotely sensed datasets and field data were used to measure the parameters needed to estimate the carbon sequestration. Multispectral satellite images such as Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope were utilized to map the distribution and percent cover. High-resolution RGB images obtained by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were also utilized to correlate field data gathered parameters. Field data such as species, percent cover, leaf area index, canopy height and above ground biomass were gathered in situ. Data extracted from different remote sensing technologies were put together to support the estimation of carbon sequestration of seagrass beds.

TI  - Greenhouse gas flux with reflooding of a drained salt marsh soil
AB  - Salt marshes are highly effective carbon (C) sinks and bury more C per square meter annually than any other ecosystem. Reclamation and anthropogenic impacts, however, have resulted in extensive losses of salt marshes. Carbon credits can be generated and sold by restoring marshes, but only if C sequestration and net reductions in greenhouse gases (GHG) are reliably quantified. Restored marshes, however, may exhibit different patterns of GHG emissions than natural marshes and it is possible that they could temporarily become sources of N2O even in the usually N-limited estuarine environment. Research on short-term GHG flux following salt marsh restoration is limited to studies of two restored marshes which examined GHG flux more than six months after the return of tidal flooding. Here we report on a laboratory experiment in which soil cores collected from a drained agricultural marsh on the St. Lawrence Estuary were flooded with estuary water. Gas flux measurements immediately after flooding revealed small increases in N2O and CH4, but a large decline in CO2 yielding, from a climatic perspective, a net cooling effect over the observation period. In addition to restoring the land's capacity to sequester C once a marsh develops, returning tidal flooding thus appears to have the added benefit of stemming large ongoing C losses. With more than 400 km2 of undeveloped dykeland, Eastern Canada is well positioned to restore large sections of marsh and contribute to reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

TI  - Vegetation persistence and carbon storage: Implications for environmental water management for Phragmites australis
AB  - Environmental water allocations are used to improve the ecological health of wetlands. There is now increasing demand for allocations to improve ecosystem productivity and respiration, and enhance carbon sequestration. Despite global recognition of wetlands as carbon sinks, information regarding carbon dynamics is lacking. This is the first study estimating carbon sequestration for semiarid Phragmites australis reedbeds. The study combined aboveground biomass assessments with stable isotope analyses of soils and modeling of biomass using Normalized Digital Vegetation Index (NDVI) to investigate the capacity of environmental water allocations to improve carbon storage. The study considered relationships between soil organic carbon (SOC), carbon sources, and reedbed persistence in the Macquarie Marshes, a regulated semiarid floodplain of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. SOC storage levels to 1 m soil depth were higher in persistent reedbeds (167 Mg ha(-1)) than ephemeral reedbeds (116-138 Mg ha(-1)). In situ P. australis was the predominant source of surface SOC at persistent reedbeds; mixed sources of surface SOC were proposed for ephemeral reedbeds. C-13 enrichment with increasing soil depth occurred in persistent and ephemeral reedbeds and may not relate to flow characteristics. Despite high SOC at persistent reedbeds, differences in the rate of accretion contributed to significantly higher rates of carbon sequestration at ephemeral reedbeds (approximately 554 and 465 g m(-2) yr(-1)) compared to persistent reedbeds (5.17 g m(-2) yr(-1)). However, under current water regimes, rapid accretion at ephemeral reedbeds cannot be maintained. Effective management of persistent P. australis reedbeds may enhance carbon sequestration in the Macquarie Marshes and floodplain wetlands more generally.

TI  - The Evolution of Blue Carbon Science
AB  - `Blue carbon' was coined over a decade ago to describe the contribution of mangroves, seagrasses, and tidal marshes to carbon drawdown in coasts and oceans, concomitantly attracting attention of policy-makers and resource managers to their potential as a natural climate solution. Here, we explore the emergence and evolution of this relatively new research field through bibliometrics approaches to investigate patterns and trends in scientific publications through time. Our aim was to understand the evolution of blue carbon science, from where we came from and where we are now. We analysed 1,729 papers from 5,763 authors. Overall, the carbon-sink capacity of these ecosystems has been recognised long before the term `blue carbon' was coined; with an annual percentage growth rate of 20\% y(-1). Research attention was highest for mangroves (similar to 38\% of publications), followed by saltmarshes (similar to 22\%), and seagrasses (similar to 18\%); while similar to 16\% of the studies included two or more blue carbon ecosystems and 5\% of the studies focused on other ecosystems. The citation burst analysis showed that, in the 1990s, the hot topic (i.e., fast-growing topic) was related to the overall flux and dynamics of carbon, with a recent transition to the role of coastal vegetation to climate change mitigation from 2009. The term `blue carbon' became a hot topic in 2017, with the strongest citation burst between 2017 and 2020. This bibliometric study draws the patterns and trends of blue carbon science and indicate that this field is evolving through time to focus more on the blue carbon role as nature climate solutions.

TI  - Bacterial carbon sources in coastal sediments: a cross-system analysis based on stable isotope data of biomarkers
AB  - Coastal ecosystems are typically highly productive, and the sediments in these systems receive organic matter from a variety of local and imported sources. To assess if general patterns are present in the origin of carbon sources for sedimentary bacteria and their relation to the origin of the sediment organic carbon pool, we compiled both literature and new data on delta C-13 of bacterial biomarkers ( the phospholipid derived fatty acids i+a15:0), along with delta C-13 data on sediment organic carbon (delta C-13(TOC)) and macrophyte biomass from a variety of typical near-coastal systems. These systems included mangroves, salt marshes (both C3 and C4-dominated sites), seagrass beds, and macroalgae-based systems, as well as unvegetated sediments. First, our delta C-13(i+a15:0) data showed large variability over the entire range of delta C-13(TOC), indicating that in many settings, bacteria may depend on carbon derived from various origins. Secondly, systems where local macrophyte production is the major supplier of organic carbon for in situ decomposition are generally limited to organic carbon-rich, peaty sites (TOC > 10 wt\%), which are likely to make up only a small part of the global area of vegetated coastal systems. These carbon-rich sediments also provided a field based estimate of isotopic fractionation between bacterial carbon sources and biomarkers (-3.7 +/- 2.1\%), which is similar to the expected value of about -3\% associated with the biosynthesis of fatty acids. Thirdly, only in systems with low TOC ( below similar to 1 wt\%), we consistently found that bacteria were selectively utilizing an isotopically enriched carbon source, which may be root exudates but more likely is derived from microphytobenthos. In other systems with between similar to 1 and 10 wt\% TOC, bacteria appear to show on average little selectivity and delta C-13(i+a15:0) data generally follow the delta C-13(TOC), even in systems where the TOC is a mixture of algal and macrophyte sources that generally are believed to have a very different degradability.

TI  - Estimating blue carbon sequestration under coastal management scenarios
AB  - Restoring and protecting ``blue carbon{''} ecosystems - mangrove forests, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows are actions considered for increasing global carbon sequestration. To improve understanding of which management actions produce the greatest gains in sequestration, we used a spatially explicit model to compare carbon sequestration and its economic value over a broad spatial scale (2500 km of coastline in southeastern Australia) for four management scenarios: (1) Managed Retreat, (2) Managed Retreat Plus Levee Removal, (3) Erosion of High Risk Areas, (4) Erosion of Moderate to High Risk Areas. We found that carbon sequestration from avoiding erosion-related emissions (abatement) would far exceed sequestration from coastal restoration. If erosion were limited only to the areas with highest erosion risk, sequestration in the non-eroded area exceeded emissions by 4.2 million Mg CO2 by 2100. However, losing blue carbon ecosystems in both moderate and high erosion risk areas would result in net emissions of 23.0 million Mg CO2 by 2100. The removal of levees combined with managed retreat was the strategy that sequestered the most carbon. Across all time points, removal of levees increased sequestration by only an additional 1 to 3\% compared to managed retreat alone. Compared to the baseline erosion scenario, the managed retreat scenario increased sequestration by 7.40 million Mg CO2 by 2030, 8.69 million Mg CO2 by 2050, and 16.6 million Mg CO2 by 2100. Associated economic value followed the same patterns, with large potential value loss from erosion greater than potential gains from conserving or re-storing ecosystems. This study quantifies the potential benefits of managed retreat and preventing erosion in existing blue carbon ecosystems to help meet climate change mitigation goals by reducing carbon emissions.

TI  - Incomplete tidal restoration may lead to persistent high CH4 emission
AB  - Salt marshes provide a range of critical ecosystem services including high rates of carbon sequestration. Recent recognition of the importance of these ecosystems has led to an interest in restoring marshes that have been degraded by human activities. Tidal restriction from coastal development can alter salt marsh plant and animal communities as well as marsh biogeochemistry. However, much less is known about how tidal restriction, and subsequent tidal restoration, may alter greenhouse gas emissions. Since salt marshes typically have lower emissions of methane than freshwater wetlands, tidal restoration that increases the salinity in a restricted marsh could theoretically improve the net global warming potential of a marsh by lowering methane emissions. In this study, we examined the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide at four temperate salt marshes, three of which had been restricted and subsequently restored. Greenhouse gas fluxes were poorly correlated with environmental parameters (biomass, temperature, moisture, sediment organic content, porewater salinity and pH, etc.) normally considered to be primary drivers of salt marsh biogeochemical processes. Carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions and uptake were not influenced by the restriction and restoration history of the marshes. Despite comparable salinity, methane emissions in one partially restored marsh were 25 times higher than those in unimpacted reference sites 13+ years after restoration. However, methane emissions from the other restored sites were equal to or significantly lower than those from unimpacted reference sites. This study highlights that we cannot assume recovering ecosystems will function like unimpacted ones, especially if restoration is incomplete.

TI  - Spatial variation of above-ground carbon storage in temperate coastal wetlands
AB  - Carbon mitigation services provided by coastal wetlands are not spatially homogeneous. The scale of assessment at which above-ground biomass is measured will directly influence carbon storage estimates. Greater confidence in estimates is obtained with approaches that describe more variation. There is a need to improve accuracy while optimising assessment effort efficiency. Accurate quantification of carbon storage is dependent upon accurate assessment of biomass, carbon content and the extent of vegetation for which carbon storage is being assessed. This study demonstrates that vegetation structure influences above-ground biomass of mangrove and saltmarsh, resulting in considerable variability in biomass estimates and associated carbon storage of temperate coastal wetlands in southeast Australia. For mangrove, variability in above-ground biomass (Mg ha(-1) SE) was best described by measuring height, stem diameter, crown area and vegetation density, whereby tall mangrove (3-8 m in height; 71.50 +/- 12.53 Mg ha(-1)) had higher biomass than both shrub (1.3-3 m in height; 53.06 +/- 6.94 Mg ha(-1)) and dwarf mangrove (< 1.3 m in height; 10.68 +/- 1.77 Mg ha(-1)). Saltmarsh aboveground biomass was best described by height, species and vegetation density, which demonstrated significant differences between rush saltmarsh (15.97 +/- 2.35 Mg ha(-1)) and herbs, grasses and sedges saltmarsh (7.51 0.91 Mg ha `). The effect of this variation was compounded by carbon content (\% C), which varied markedly between vegetation structural form and species (30.9-49.8\% C). Maintaining accuracy when assessing carbon storage requires mapping units that correspond to the scale of biomass assessments. Results from this study suggest that recognition of variation in biomass and carbon content of mangrove and saltmarsh vegetation structure will enhance the accuracy of estimates of carbon storage, and provide the confidence necessary for carbon storage inventories.

TI  - Nitrous oxide fluxes in estuarine environments: response to global change
AB  - Nitrous oxide is a powerful, long-lived greenhouse gas, but we know little about the role of estuarine areas in the global N2O budget. This review summarizes 56 studies of N2O fluxes and associated biogeochemical controlling factors in estuarine open waters, salt marshes, mangroves, and intertidal sediments. The majority of in situ N2O production occurs as a result of sediment denitrification, although the water column contributes N2O through nitrification in suspended particles. The most important factors controlling N2O fluxes seem to be dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and oxygen availability, which in turn are affected by tidal cycles, groundwater inputs, and macrophyte density. The heterogeneity of coastal environments leads to a high variability in observations, but on average estuarine open water, intertidal and vegetated environments are sites of a small positive N2O flux to the atmosphere (range 0.15-0.91; median 0.31; Tg N2O-N yr(-1)). Global changes in macrophyte distribution and anthropogenic nitrogen loading are expected to increase N2O emissions from estuaries. We estimate that a doubling of current median NO3- concentrations would increase the global estuary water-air N2O flux by about 0.45 Tg N2O-N yr(-1) or about 190\%. A loss of 50\% of mangrove habitat, being converted to unvegetated intertidal area, would result in a net decrease in N2O emissions of 0.002 Tg N2O-N yr(-1). In contrast, conversion of 50\% of salt marsh to unvegetated area would result in a net increase of 0.001 Tg N2O-N yr(-1). Decreased oxygen concentrations may inhibit production of N2O by nitrification; however, sediment denitrification and the associated ratio of N2O:N-2 is expected to increase.

TI  - Do we have enough pieces of the jigsaw to integrate CO2 fluxes in the coastal ocean?
AB  - Annually integrated air-water CO2 flux data in 44 coastal environments were compiled from literature. Data were gathered in 8 major ecosystems (inner estuaries, outer estuaries, whole estuarine systems, mangroves, salt marshes, coral reefs, upwelling systems, and open continental shelves), and up-scaled in the first attempt to integrate air-water CO2 fluxes over the coastal ocean (26 x 10(6) km(2)), taking into account its geographical and ecological diversity. Air-water CO2 fluxes were then up-scaled in global ocean (362 x 10(6) km(2)) using the present estimates for the coastal ocean and those from Takahashi et al. (2002) for the open ocean (336 x 106 km(2)). If estuaries and salt marshes are not taken into consideration in the up-scaling, the coastal ocean behaves as a sink for atmospheric CO2 (-1.17 Mol C m(-2) yr(-1)) and the uptake of atmospheric CO2 by the global ocean increases by 24\% (-1.93 versus -1.56 Pg C yr(-1)). The inclusion of the coastal ocean increases the estimates of CO2 uptake by the global ocean by 57\% for high latitude areas (-0.44 versus -0.28 Pg C yr(-1)) and by 15\% for temperate latitude areas (-2.36 versus -2.06 Pg C yr(-1)). At subtropical and tropical latitudes, the contribution from the coastal ocean increases the CO2 emission to the atmosphere from the global ocean by 13\% (0.87 versus 0.77 Pg C yr(-1)). If estuaries and salt marshes are taken into consideration in the upscaling, the coastal ocean behaves as a source for atmospheric CO2 (0.38 mol C m(-2) yr(-1)) and the uptake of atmospheric CO2 from the global ocean decreases by 12\% (-1.44 versus -1.56 Pg C yr(-1)). At high and subtropical and tropical latitudes, the coastal ocean behaves as a source for atmospheric CO2 but at temperate latitudes, it still behaves as a moderate CO2 sink. A rigorous tip-scaling of air-water CO2 fluxes in the coastal ocean is hampered by the poorly constrained estimate of the surface area of inner estuaries. The present estimates clearly indicate the significance of this biogeochemicatly. highly active region of the biosphere in the global CO2 cycle.

TI  - Managed Retreat of Saline Coastal Wetlands: Challenges and Opportunities Identified from the Hunter River Estuary, Australia
AB  - We analyse the potential impacts of sea-level rise on the management of saline coastal wetlands in the Hunter River estuary, NSW, Australia. We model two management options: leaving all floodgates open, facilitating retreat of mangrove and saltmarsh into low-lying coastal lands; and leaving floodgates closed. For both management options we modelled the potential extent of saline coastal wetland to 2100 under a low sea-level rise scenario (based on 5 % minima of SRES B1 emissions scenario) and a high sea-level rise scenario (based on 95 % maxima of SRES A1FI emissions scenario). In both instances we quantified the carbon burial benefits associated with those actions. Using a dynamic elevation model, which factored in the accretion and vertical elevation responses of mangrove and saltmarsh to rising sea levels, we projected the distribution of saline coastal wetlands, and estimated the volume of sediment and carbon burial across the estuary under each scenario. We found that the management of floodgates is the primary determinant of potential saline coastal wetland extent to 2100, with only 33 % of the potential wetland area remaining under the high sea-level rise scenario, with floodgates closed, and with a 127 % expansion of potential wetland extent with floodgates open and levees breached. Carbon burial was an additional benefit of accommodating landward retreat of wetlands, with an additional 280,000 tonnes of carbon buried under the high sea-level rise scenario with floodgates open (775,075 tonnes with floodgates open and 490,280 tonnes with floodgates closed). Nearly all of the Hunter Wetlands National Park, a Ramsar wetland, will be lost under the high sea-level rise scenario, while there is potential for expansion of the wetland area by 35 % under the low sea-level rise scenario, regardless of floodgate management. We recommend that National Parks, Reserves, Ramsar sites and other static conservation mechanisms employed to protect significant coastal wetlands must begin to employ dynamic buffers to accommodate sea-level rise change impacts, which will likely require land purchase or other agreements with private landholders. The costs of facilitating adaptation may be offset by carbon sequestration gains. Â© 2013 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.

TI  - Shift in soil organic carbon and nitrogen pools in different reclaimed lands following intensive coastal reclamation on the coasts of eastern China
AB  - The impacts of coastal reclamation on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) sinks of coastal wetlands remain unclearly understood. This study was conducted to investigate the alterations of soil organic C and N (SOC and SON) pools following conversion of Phragmites australis salt marsh into fishpond, wheat and rapeseed fields and town construction land through reclamation along Jiangsu coast in eastern China. Coastal reclamation significantly increased stocks of soil total, labile and recalcitrant organic C and N (SLOC, SLON, SROC, and SRON), and concentrations of water-soluble organic C (WSOC), microbial biomass C and N (SMBC and SMBN), cumulative CO2-C mineralization (MINC) following conversion of P. australis salt marsh into fishpond, wheat and rapeseed fields. However, coastal reclamation reduced SOC, SLOC, SROC, SRON, WSOC, SMBC, SMBN, and MINC following conversion of P. australis salt marsh into town construction land. Our results suggest that coastal reclamation affects C and N sinks of coastal wetlands by changing SOC and SON pools size, stability and dynamics changes following conversion of P. australis salt marsh into other land use types. This finding were primarily attributed to alterations in quantity and quality of exogenous materials returning the soil, and soil physiochemical properties as affected by coastal reclamation.

TI  - Salt marsh-mangrove ecotones: using structural gradients to investigate the effects of woody plant encroachment on plant-soil interactions and ecosystem carbon pools
AB  - Changing winter climate extremes are expected to result in the poleward migration of mangrove forests at the expense of salt marshes. Although mangroves and marshes are both highly valued ecosystems, the ecological implications of mangrove expansion have not been fully investigated. Here, we examined the effects of mangrove expansion on below-ground properties related to peat development and carbon storage. We investigated plant-soil interactions in marshes and across mangrove forest structural gradients in three locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico (USA). We compared our results to those from terrestrial grasslands where the effects of woody plant encroachment are often influenced by rainfall and plant traits. Abiotic conditions at our study locations differed, particularly in terms of physicochemical properties related to precipitation. Marsh species composition, marsh above-ground biomass, and mangrove forest structural complexity also varied across these locations. Marshes in the driest location (Central Texas) had higher salinities and were dominated by low biomass succulent plants and lower soil carbon pools. Marshes in the wetter, less saline locations (Louisiana and North Florida) contained high biomass grasses and higher soil carbon pools. At all locations, above-ground biomass and above-ground carbon pools were higher in mangroves than marshes; however, below-ground soil carbon pools were only higher in mangroves than marshes in the driest location. In the wetter locations, the linkages between mangrove forest structure and soil properties were minimal or not significant. However, in the driest location, there was a significant increase in soil properties related to peat development and carbon storage with increased mangrove forest structural development.Synthesis: Our results indicate that the ecological implications of woody plant encroachment in tidal saline wetlands are dependent upon precipitation controls of plant-soil interactions. Although the above-ground effects of mangrove expansion are consistently large, below-ground influences of mangrove expansion appear to be greatest along low-rainfall coasts where salinities are high and marshes being replaced are carbon poor and dominated by succulent plants. Collectively, these findings complement those from terrestrial ecosystems and reinforce the importance of considering rainfall and plant-soil interactions within predictions of the ecological effects of woody plant encroachment.

TI  - Plant biomass and rates of carbon dioxide uptake are enhanced by successful restoration of tidal connectivity in salt marshes
AB  - Salt marshes, due to their capability to bury soil carbon (C), are potentially important regional C sinks. Efforts to restore tidal flow to former salt marshes have increased in recent decades in New England (USA), as well as in some other parts of the world. In this study, we investigated plant biomass and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes at four sites where restoration of tidal flow occurred five to ten years prior to the study. Site elevation, aboveground biomass, CO2 flux, and porewater chemistry were measured in 2015 and 2016 in both restored marshes and adjacent marshes where tidal flow had never been restricted. We found that the elevation in restored marsh sites was 2â€“16 cm lower than their natural references. Restored marshes where porewater chemistry was similar to the natural reference had greater plant aboveground biomass, gross ecosystem production, ecosystem respiration, as well as net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) than the natural reference, even though they had the same plant species. We also compared respiration rates in aboveground biomass (AR) and soil (BR) during July 2016, and found that restored marshes had higher AR and BR fluxes than natural references. Our findings indicated that well-restored salt marshes can result in greater plant biomass and NEP, which has the potential to enhance rates of C sequestration at 10-yrs post restoration. Those differences were likely due to lower elevation and greater flooding frequency in the recently restored marshes than the natural marsh. The inverse relationship between elevation and productivity further suggests that, where sea-level rise rate does not surpass the threshold of plant survival, the restoration of these salt marshes may lead to enhanced organic and mineral sedimentation, extending marsh survival under increased sea level, and recouping carbon stocks that were lost during decades of tidal restriction.

TI  - A review of carbon monitoring in wet carbon systems using remote sensing
AB  - Carbon monitoring is critical for the reporting and verification of carbon stocks and change. Remote sensing is a tool increasingly used to estimate the spatial heterogeneity, extent and change of carbon stocks within and across various systems. We designate the use of the term wet carbon system to the interconnected wetlands, ocean, river and streams, lakes and ponds, and permafrost, which are carbon-dense and vital conduits for carbon throughout the terrestrial and aquatic sections of the carbon cycle. We reviewed wet carbon monitoring studies that utilize earth observation to improve our knowledge of data gaps, methods, and future research recommendations. To achieve this, we conducted a systematic review collecting 1622 references and screening them with a combination of text matching and a panel of three experts. The search found 496 references, with an additional 78 references added by experts. Our study found considerable variability of the utilization of remote sensing and global wet carbon monitoring progress across the nine systems analyzed. The review highlighted that remote sensing is routinely used to globally map carbon in mangroves and oceans, whereas seagrass, terrestrial wetlands, tidal marshes, rivers, and permafrost would benefit from more accurate and comprehensive global maps of extent. We identified three critical gaps and twelve recommendations to continue progressing wet carbon systems and increase cross system scientific inquiry.

TI  - Flocculation and sediment deposition in a hypertidal creek
AB  - In the hypertidal Bay of Fundy, environmental impacts in response to commercial-scale tidal power development remain to be fully understood. The extraction of tidal energy may impact sediment dynamics in far-field environments, such as the intertidal zone, through potential alterations to tidal amplitude in the Minas Basin. Tidal conditions (e.g. current velocity, turbulence, suspended sediment concentration) were monitored in a sheltered salt marsh creek over 18 tidal cycles in various stages of the spring-neap cycle. Samples of deposited and suspended sediments were collected and analyzed for grain size using a Beckman Coulter Multisizer III. Results suggest that the flocculated component of both deposited and suspended sediment is consistently high over a wide range of tidal conditions. A routinely high incoming concentration of highly-flocculated material results in large amounts of sediment deposition in tidal creeks in response to individual tidal cycles. Resuspension and removal of newly deposited material is shown to vary with over-marsh, bankfull and channel-restricted tides. Disruption of the tidal regime due to a reduction in Minas Basin tidal amplitude may lessen the cumulative export capacity of tidal channels over time, potentially leading to gradual infilling of tidal creeks.

TI  - Invasive Phragmites Increases Blue Carbon Stock and Soil Volume in a St. Lawrence Estuary Marsh
AB  - Our study of a St. Lawrence Estuary marsh reveals that, compared to native Spartina patens-dominated vegetation, invasive Phragmites australis makes a greater contribution to soil volume and carbon stock (referred to as blue carbon). Phragmites' contributions to soil volume enhance marsh sustainability in face of sea level rise, and its greater contribution to soil carbon helps to reduce the atmospheric concentration of CO2. Phragmites australis (common reed) is a cosmopolitan species growing in fresh to brackish wetlands. An invasive genetic strain, introduced from Europe or Asia, has expanded extensively along the St. Lawrence River in the last few decades but has been little studied on the estuarine portion. We collected soil cores from three sites within an invasive Phragmites stand and one site within S. patens-dominated stand in a St. Lawrence Estuary salt marsh near la Pocatiere, Quebec. We measured the bulk density, carbon content, volume, and mass of belowground organic matter in 2-cm-thick soil layers of three cores at each Phragmites site. Bulk density and carbon content were measured in 5-cm-thick soil layers of three cores at S. patens site. Results showed that soil in the Phragmites stands held 37â€“77% more blue carbon than in the S. patens-dominated marsh. Based upon their diameter size, Phragmites rhizomes could be contributing 7.4â€“10.2Â cm to the thickness in the upper 20Â cm of soil. We suggest that any management of invasive Phragmites include consideration of its role in increasing blue carbon stocks and marsh resilience along with other ecosystem services. Â©2020.

TI  - Alkalinity export to the ocean is a major carbon sequestration mechanism in a macrotidal saltmarsh
AB  - Saltmarshes are a blue carbon ecosystem accumulating large quantities of organic carbon in sediments. Some of this carbon can be transformed into dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and methane (CH4) that may eventually be exported to the ocean or atmosphere. Although extensive studies have quantified specific components of the carbon budget such as carbon burial, limited attention has been given to pore-water-derived carbon and total alkalinity (TA) exports to the ocean. Here, we quantified lateral exports to the ocean (outwelling) of 202 +/- 160 and 78 +/- 75 mmol m(-2)d(-1) of DIC and TA, respectively. The TA : DIC concentration ratio in the creek waters was similar to 1, implying TA production from anaerobic mineralization in sediments. The lateral TA exports were comparable to the local (94 +/- 48 mmol m(-2)d(-1)) and national (similar to 50 mmol m(-2)d(-1)) organic carbon burial. High TA exports could locally increase the ocean buffering capacity and contribute bicarbonate to the coastal ocean, acting as a long-term carbon storage. Pore water traced by radon contributed 28-37\% and 58-69\% of DIC and TA exports. Separating the two major DIC components (i.e., CO2 emissions and alkalinity exports) is essential to resolve the carbon sequestration potential from saltmarshes. Here, dissolved CO2 emissions to the atmosphere accounted for 3-5\% of total DIC outwelling. CH4 emissions played a minor role offsetting around 0.3 to 6\% of the carbon sequestration. Overall, we demonstrate that alkalinity export into the ocean can be an overlooked carbon sequestration pathway in saltmarshes at rates comparable to carbon burial.

Compared with terrestrial ecosystems, coastal vegetation shows higher rates of atmospheric CO2 uptake and a more efficient retention of carbon (C) in sediments. Salt marshes present the highest values as C binders, although a global estimation of these values is still pending due to regional gaps in the records predominantly from the southern hemisphere. There are no clear patterns or dominant processes with enough evidence to account for the observed variability, suggesting that context dependent processes are likely greatest influencers on C storage. Salt marshes in the South West Atlantic (SWA) coast are densely populated by the intertidal burrowing and herbivore crab Neohelice (=Chasmagnathus) granulata. Many ecological processes related to C transformation occurring in these salt marshes are influenced by crab activities, either through bioturbation or via herbivory. We hypothesize that N. granulata could have a significant role in the capacity of SWA salt marshes to bind C. Reduction of plant biomass, increased aerobic decomposition in the sediment and facilitation of erosion are some of the multiple effects exerted by N. granulata that can directly and indirectly modify the capacity of salt marshes to bind C. Here, we compiled information available regarding C sequestration and accumulation in SWA coastal salt marshes and propose a hypothetical model including the mechanisms mediated by N. granulata that interfere the transformation paths of C in salt marshes. The data suggest that mechanisms that are top-down regulated, negatively affect C accumulation in the form of aboveground biomass especially in salt marshes dominated by Spartina alterniflora. While, mechanisms mediated by bioturbation can negatively (increasing oxygenation and thus facilitating aerobic degradation) affect as well as positively (increasing retention of macrodetritus) affect the accumulation of C, the latter being of greater magnitude in Spartina densiflora salt marshes.

TI  - Alkalinity Production Coupled to Pyrite Formation Represents an Unaccounted Blue Carbon Sink
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems, including mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses, mitigate climate change by storing atmospheric carbon. Previous blue carbon research has focused on organic carbon stocks. However, recent studies suggest that lateral inorganic carbon export might be equally important. Lateral export is a long-term carbon sink if carbon is exported as alkalinity (TAlk) produced via sulfate reduction coupled to pyrite formation. This study evaluates drivers of pyrite formation in blue carbon ecosystems, compares pyrite production to TAlk outwelling rates, and estimates global pyrite stocks in mangroves. We quantified pyrite stocks in mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses along a latitudinal gradient on the Australian East Coast, including a mangrove dieback area, and in the Everglades (Florida, USA). Our results indicate that pyrite stocks were driven by a combination of biomass, tidal amplitude, sediment organic carbon, sediment accumulation rates, rainfall, latitude, temperature, and iron availability. Pyrite stocks were three-times higher in mangroves (103Â Â±Â 61Â Mg/ha) than in saltmarshes (30Â Â±Â 30Â Mg/ha) and seagrasses (32Â Â±Â 1Â Mg/ha). Mangrove pyrite stocks were linearly correlated to TAlk export at sites where sulfate reduction was the dominant TAlk producing process. However, pyrite generation could not explain all TAlk outwelling. We present the first global model estimating pyrite stocks in mangroves, giving a first-order estimate of 197Â Mg/ha (RMSEÂ =Â 24Â Mg/ha). In mangroves, estimated global TAlk production coupled to pyrite formation (âˆ¼3Â mol/m2/y) is equal to âˆ¼24% of their global carbon burial rate, highlighting the importance of including TAlk export in future blue carbon budgets.

TI  - Utility of radium quartet for evaluating porewater-derived carbon to a saltmarsh nearshore water: Implications for blue carbon export
AB  - Saltmarshes are global hotspots of carbon sequestration and storage and are known as effective blue carbon ecosystems. However, the role of porewater exchange in saltmarshes as a source of carbon to the nearshore waters is still poorly constrained. Herein, we examined the radium quartet, dissolved inorganic (DIC) and organic (DOC) carbon in the porewater and nearshore surface water of Chongming Dongtan saltmarsh, China. Multiple methods based on the radium quartet were applied to estimate the porewater exchange, including the three-endmember model, mass balance model and time series observation. All methods revealed that the porewater exchange rate in Chongming Dongtan saltmarsh equaled 3.37 Â± 1.23 cm dâˆ’1. The porewater-derived DIC and DOC fluxes were then estimated to be (1.51 Â± 0.64) Ã— 107 and (9.97 Â± 6.96) Ã— 105 mol dâˆ’1, respectively, which correspondingly made up 64.6% and 35.6%, of the total inputs into the Chongming Dongtan saltmarsh nearshore water. Considering the intertidal area covered by saltmarsh vegetation, carbon export through the porewater exchange was 3.87 Â± 1.55 g C mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1, and was 1.2-fold greater than the carbon burial rate, accounting for approximately 29% of carbon outwelling in Chongming Dongtan saltmarsh. This study highlights the significance of porewater exchange for evaluating carbon sequestration capacity, and suggests that porewater exchange should not be overlooked in blue carbon assessments of saltmarshes.

TI  - ``Slow{''} and ``fast{''} in blue carbon: Differential turnover of allochthonous and autochthonous organic matter in minerogenic salt marsh sediments
AB  - Salt marshes are recognized as blue carbon ecosystems for their ability to rapidly sequester organic carbon (OC) via sedimentation. For this reason, there is growing interest in managing these systems to help mitigate climate change. However, in order for sediment accretion to offset ongoing CO2 emissions, organic matter undergoing burial must be derived from contemporary primary production. To investigate the provenance of OC sequestered by salt marshes, we analyzed the concentration and isotope composition (delta C-13 and Delta C-14) of sedimentary OC in two minerogenic marshes in San Francisco Bay, California, USA. Data from the low marsh dominated by Spartinaspp. show that autochthonous OC is entering the sediment matrix and may in part be stabilized through incorporation into the mineral-bound pool. However, the sedimentary OC stock as a whole is dominated by material with low values of delta C-13 (similar to -20 to -25 parts per thousand) and Delta C-14 (similar to 100 to -300 parts per thousand) indicating a preponderance of allochthonous OC that was retained in other OC reservoirs for 10(2) to 10(3) years prior to deposition in the marsh. Diagenetic modeling of OC and its delta C-13 values further shows that autochthonous OC is lost from the sediment profile at a much faster rate than allochthonous OC. The rapid turnover of contemporary autochthonous OC ({''}fast carbon{''}) relative to the apparent stability of old allochthonous OC ({''}slow carbon{''}) suggest that carbon burial at these sites is largely decoupled from ongoing CO2 emissions.

TI  - Soil CO2 efflux as early response assessment for remediation of diesel polluted soils
AB  - Soil contamination by petroleum hydrocarbons constitutes a considerable environmental risk due to their toxicity. In recent decades, several biological and chemical technologies have been developed for remediating in situ soils and waters affected by leakages of diesel fuel. The aim of this study is to assess the soil CO2 efflux as an early measuring tool of the effectiveness of these remediation treatments applied in situ on diesel polluted soils. The study site was located in a tidal salt marsh ecosystem in the Cadiz Bay, where two zones were distinguished according to the level of diesel pollutant (high-polluted and low-polluted areas). In the high-polluted area, three remediation technologies (phytoremediation, bioremediation, and chemical oxidation) were applied individually as well as in combination in order to identify synergies that improve the decontamination performance. The specific objectives of the study were (1) to determine soil CO2 efflux in a diesel polluted tidal salt marsh under a Mediterranean climate; (2) to examine the relationships between soil moisture content, soil temperature and soil CO2 efflux; (3) to test whether the different remediation treatments promote an early response in soil CO2 efflux. The initial results showed a positive correlation between soil temperature fluctuations and soil CO2 efflux in the low-polluted area of the marsh, but no significant relationships were detected in the high-polluted area. On average, remediation treatments lead to greater soil CO2 efflux rates (81.3 and 294.8 mg CO2-C m(-2) h(-1) before and after treatment implementations, respectively). Of all the remediation treatments, only those plots in which pure biological treatments were employed (phytobarrier, phytoremediation and bioremediation) displayed a clear early response in soil CO2 efflux.

TI  - Carbon sequestration and its potential by wetland ecosystems in China
AB  - As one of the important ecosystem services of wetlands, carbon sequestration of lakes and swamps in China were investigated in this paper. Based on the reported bulk density and total organic carbon content, we estimated the carbon sequestration rate of major lakes and swamps regions in China. The carbon sequestration capacity of lakes of the whole country was 1981.87GgC Â· a-1. Lakes in East China exhibited the highest carbon sequestration rate and the greatest carbon sequestration capacity. Swamps demonstrated a total higher carbon sequestration of 4.9lTgC, 1.47 times greater than that of lakes in China. Among the five varieties of swamps, mangrove had the highest carbon sequestration rate of 444.27 gC Â· m-2Â· a-1, while the inland marsh was of the greatest carbon sequestration capacity, the amount was 1501.12 GgC a-1. Wetlands reclamation led to huge amount of carbon emission, and the carbon loss due to reclamation of lakes and swamps were 0.82 and 26.9Tg, respectively. After the great flood in 1998, wetlands recovery policies such as returning farms to lakes and swamps were implemented. The carbon sequestration potential of wetlands recovery was 30.48GgC Â·a-1, including 30.26GgC Â· a-1 from returning farms to lakes and 0.22GgC Â· a-1 from returning farms to swamps. Under the ongoing National Wetland Conservation Action Plan, the carbon sequestration potential of wetland restoration was estimated at 6.57GgC Â· a-1. Accordingly, wetland protection and restoration can improve the carbon sequestration potential of wetlands.

TI  - Sediment subsidy: Effects on soil-plant responses in a rapidly submerging coastal salt marsh
AB  - The tidal energy subsidy hypothesis postulates that the high primary productivity of coastal salt marshes is the result of an energy subsidy provided by the tides. The sediment component of this subsidy is especially important in contributing to the elevation increase of the marsh surface, a process essential for the sustainability of salt marshes during periods of sea level rise. This research tested the hypothesis that sediment subsidies have an ameliorating effect on sea level rise-induced impacts to salt marsh vigor. We assessed the plant structural and soil physico-chemical responses to different intensities of sediment subsidy in a salt marsh experiencing a high rate of relative sea level rise. Sediments were hydraulically dredged with a high fluid to solids ratio (85%:15%) from the Gulf of Mexico and dispersed into a Spartina alterniflora dominated salt marsh. Approximately 2 years after this fluid-sediment-enrichment, maximum sediment elevation did not exceed 30cm above ambient and both plant cover and aboveground biomass responded positively. Sediment subsidy increased soil mineral matter, and, in turn, soil fertility and marsh elevation, and thereby reduced nutrient deficiency, flooding, and interstitial sulfide stresses. Thus, sediment subsidy generated a more favorable environment for plant growth and potentially, marsh sustainability. Â© 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Changes in organic carbon accumulation driven by mangrove expansion and deforestation in a New Zealand estuary
AB  - Mangroves are rapidly being lost to deforestation in many locations while expanding their areal extent in other subtropical and temperate regions. Currently, there is a paucity of information on how these changes may alter the carbon accumulation capacity of coastal areas. Here, sediment cores were collected from two areas and used to determine the influence of mangrove migration and deforestation on sediment carbon stocks and accumulation rates. The deforested area contained lower sedimentary organic carbon stocks (2767 +/- 580 g m(-2)) compared to the preserved area (6949 +/- 84 g m(-2)). Sediment accumulation rates, derived from excess Pb-210 and Pu239+240 depositional signatures, ranged from 0.19 to 0.35 cm yr(-1). The total sedimentary organic carbon (TOC) accumulation rates for the period after mangrove deforestation (2005-2011) exhibited significant differences between preserved areas (Core C: 43.9 +/- 6.9 g m(-2) yr(-1); Core D: 83.1 +/- 5.9 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and the deforested area (Core B: 25.8 +/- 6.0 g m(-2) yr(-1)), suggesting a decline after deforestation. For the preserved area, the TOC accumulation under mangrove dominance (65.5 +/- 16.3 g m(-2) yr(-1), after 1944) was higher than under saltmarsh dominance (23.5 +/- 15.9 g m(-2) yr(-1,) before 1944), as revealed by carbon isotopic signatures (delta C-13). The increase in the TOC accumulation due to mangrove expansion in this New Zealand estuary was conservatively estimated as three-fold higher, and two-fold higher in stocks in comparison to the period when this ecosystem was dominated by non-mangrove vegetation.

TI  - Quantification of blue carbon in tropical salt marshes and their role in climate change mitigation
AB  - Vegetated coastal ecosystems (VCE) display a promising potential to act as natural carbon sinks in climate change mitigation. Although growing interest in wetland carbon has intensified the global level carbon stock estimation studies, large knowledge gaps and uncertainties remain, particularly in tropical salt marshes in the South and Southeast Asian regions. Therefore, the current study aims to quantify the organic carbon stocks in the salt marsh habitats on the Northwest coast of Sri Lanka and to showcase the relevance of salt marsh carbon in local and regional contexts. Vegetation and soil up to a depth of 50 cm were sampled from four sites representing the Wedithalathive Nature Reserve (WNR). Species-specific allometric relationships developed for the major succulent halophytic species indicated a significant positive correlation between dry biomass and plant height. The loss-on-ignition (LOI) technique was applied in combination with a carbon conversion factor to calculate the soil organic carbon (SOC) content across 4 depth intervals. The study provided an average total organic carbon (TOC) storage of 73 Â± 14.47 Mg C haâˆ’1 up to a depth of 50 cm, in which the aboveground vegetation accounted for ~2% share. Sri Lankan salt marshes hold 2.01 Tg of organic carbon and directly reflect their potential for inclusion in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. This has been the first comprehensive study on salt marsh blue carbon stocks in Sri Lanka and the findings of this study will strengthen the knowledge base on regional and global saltmarsh carbon stocks and their potential role in climate change mitigation.

TI  - Modelling predictive changes of blue carbon due to sea-level rise using InVEST model in Chilaw Lagoon, Sri Lanka
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems such as mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds, are vital for mitigating climate change owing to their high capacity for carbon capture and storage. Sea-level rise (SLR), as a result of climate change, poses a severe threat to these ecosystems due to the proximity of these ecosystems to coastal margins and, thus, modelling how blue carbon within these ecosystems will respond to SLR scenarios will prove vital to the effective management and conservation of these ecosystems. The Chilaw lagoon in Sri Lanka is home to considerably small and highly disturbed mangrove forests (422.92 ha) where the blue carbon dynamics of the lagoon are poorly studied. The primary objective of this study was to model and predict the possible changes to blue carbon in the Chilaw lagoon owing to the impact of SLR, making use of the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST 3.11.0) Coastal Blue Carbon Model. Carbon storage, carbon accumulation, carbon emissions, net carbon sequestration, and valuation of net carbon sequestration were modelled considering four SLR scenarios relating to Shared Socioeconomic Pathways indicated in the 6th assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for years 2100 and 2150. The only blue carbon land-use land cover (LULC) identified was the mangrove forest. The present blue carbon stock in the ecosystem was found to be 991.52 MgC and it is predicted to be 2049.93 MgC in the year 2100. In the year 2150, the influence of SLR is evident and carbon stocks are predicted to decrease with increasing extents of inundation. Total carbon sequestration (2021-2150), the monetary value of carbon sequestration in 2150, and carbon accumulation (2100-2150) were all predicted to decrease with rising sea levels. Emissions of carbon were found to increase with the increasing level of disturbance owing to SLR. The study represents the first time the InVEST model was utilized to model blue carbon dynamics in Sri Lanka and indicates the possible changes to blue carbon in the Chilaw lagoon and quantifies it as well.

TI  - Effects of exotic Spartina alterniflora on vertical soil organic carbon distribution and storage amount in coastal salt marshes in Jiangsu, China
AB  - Coastal wetlands soil organic carbon (SOC) plays an important role in global carbon sequestration, and exotic S. alterniflora affects the coastal ecosystem's functions including SOC storage (SOCS). We investigated the vertical deep soil SOC distribution (0-300 cm) in Jiangsu salt marsh and estimated its changes. The results show that (1) exotic S. alterniflora increases the SOC, with higher densities (g kg(-1)) in both topsoil and deep soil in its colonized area, and subsequently increases the SOCS vertical depth (cm) distribution. Such influences become more prominent with time since the introduction of S. alterniflora. The deepest SOC distribution (180 cm) and the highest SOC content (2.14 +/- 0.19 g kg(-1)) in the deep layer( 50-300 cm) were found in the zones where S. salsa - S. alterniflora co-exist (SSI). The vertical SOC distribution in zones where multi-species co-exists is deeper than that in mono-species dominated zones; (2) The deep soil (100-300 cm) SOC accounts more than 50\% of 0-300 cm SOC in Jiangsu salt marsh, suggesting that SOC content of deep soil should not be ignored when calculating the global soil carbon stock; (3) Total SOCS within 0-300 cm in Jiangsu salt marshes (107.84 x 10(6) m(2)) is 84.90 x 10(10) g, of which 0-100 cm, 100-200 cm and 200-300 cm layer accounts for 38.25\%, 30.72\% and 31.03\%, respectively. The size of the SOCS (0-300 cm) in the Jiangsu salt marshes relatively to the global biome (0.36 x 10(-6)) is in a lower proportion of the range of salt marsh area to global biome area (0.89 x 10(-6)). The S. alterniflora salt marsh contributes most of the SOCS in the 0-300 cm and 0-100 cm soils. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Changes in organic carbon source and storage with sea level rise-induced transgression in a Chesapeake Bay marsh
AB  - Organic matter (OM) accumulation in marsh soils affects marsh survival under rapid sea-level rise (SLR). This work describes the changing organic geochemistry of a salt marsh located in the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay that has transgressed inland with SLR over the past 35-75 years. Marsh soils and vegetation were sampled along an elevation gradient from the intertidal zone to the adjacent forest, representing a space-for-time substitution of the process of marsh transgression. Stable carbon isotope analysis of bulk OM gives evidence for a transition from C3 upland-sourced OM to C4-dominated marsh vegetation over time. The vegetative source of the OM changes along a marsh-upland mixing line from herbaceous angiosperm-sourced lignin in the lower elevation marsh to a woody gymnosperm signature at the upper border of the marsh. The results of stable isotope and lignin analyses illustrate that landward encroachment of marsh grasses results in deposition of herbaceous tissues exhibiting relatively little decay. This presents a possible mechanism for OM stabilization as marshes migrate inland. Regional index terms: USA, Maryland, Chesapeake Bay, Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge.

TI  - Carbon storage potential in a recently created brackish marsh in eastern North Carolina, USA
AB  - Carbon (C) sequestration through accumulated plant biomass and storage in soils can potentially make wetland ecosystems net C sinks. Here, we collected GHG flux, plant biomass, and litter decomposition data from three distinct vegetation zones (Spartina alterniflora, Juncus roemerianus and Spartina patens) on a 7-year-old created brackish marsh in North Carolina, USA, and integrate these data into an overall C mass balance budget. The marsh fixed an average of 1.85 g C mâˆ’2 dayâˆ’1 through plant photosynthesis. About 41â€“46% of the fixed C remained in plants, while 18.4% of the C was decomposed and released back to the atmosphere as CO2 and CH4, and 8.6â€“13.2% of the decomposed C was stored as soil C. In all, this created marsh sequestered 28.7â€“44.7 Mg CO2 yearâˆ’1 across the 14 ha marsh. Because the brackish marsh emitted only small amounts of CH4 and N2O, the CO2 equivalent emission of the marsh was âˆ’0.87 to âˆ’0.56 g CO2-eq mâˆ’2 dayâˆ’1, indicating the marsh has a net effect in reducing GHGs to the atmosphere and contributes to cooling. However, resultant CO2 credit (through the increment of soil C) would be worth only $30.76â€“$47.90 USD per hectare annually, or $431â€“$671 per year for the project, which, coupled with other enhanced ecosystem services, could provide landowners with some additional economic incentive for future creation projects. Nevertheless, C mass balance determinations and radiative cooling metrics showed promise in demonstrating the potential of a young created brackish marsh to act as a net carbon sink.

TI  - Carbon Storage Increases with Site Age as Created Salt Marshes Transition to Mangrove Forests in Tampa Bay, Florida (USA)
AB  - Coastal wetlands can sequester large amounts of organic carbon (OC), providing an additional motivation for the preservation and restoration of these ecosystems. In Tampa Bay (Florida, USA), created coastal wetlands are initially planted with Spartina spp., but nearly all sites naturally transition into mangrove forests. It was hypothesized that carbon storage in the created wetlands would increase with site age due to the accumulation of soil organic carbon and replacement of salt marsh vegetation with mangrove forests. Mature, mangrove-dominated sites had higher total organic carbon stocks (138.7 +/- 13.8 Mg C ha(-1)) than middle-aged transitional sites (85.6 +/- 25.5 Mg C ha(-1)) or young salt marshes (34.5 +/- 7.7 Mg C ha(-1)). Mature sites consisted of tall trees (> 130 cm tall) and scarce salt marsh vegetation. Transitional sites contained mangrove scrubs (30-130 cm tall) and seedlings (< 30 cm tall) while still supporting salt marsh vegetation; younger sites were dominated by salt marsh vegetation and had no trees. Belowground OC constituted the greatest carbon pool (59.4\% of the total OC stock), but belowground OC stocks were not significantly different among the site age classes, suggesting that aboveground OC stocks drove the difference in total OC stocks. The total carbon accumulation rate, including both aboveground and belowground OC, was 4.7 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) across the 26-year chronosequence. This study has demonstrated that carbon storage in created coastal wetlands is correlated to wetland age, indicating that these ecosystems have the potential to become significant sources of OC storage.

TI  - Causal mechanisms of soil organic matter decomposition: deconstructing salinity and flooding impacts in coastal wetlands
AB  - Coastal wetlands significantly contribute to global carbon storage potential. Sea-level rise and other climate-change-induced disturbances threaten coastal wetland sustainability and carbon storage capacity. It is critical that we understand the mechanisms controlling wetland carbon loss so that we can predict and manage these resources in anticipation of climate change. However, our current understanding of the mechanisms that control soil organic matter decomposition, in particular the impacts of elevated salinity, are limited, and literature reports are contradictory. In an attempt to improve our understanding of these complex processes, we measured root and rhizome decomposition and developed a causal model to identify and quantify the mechanisms that influence soil organic matter decomposition in coastal wetlands that are impacted by sea-level rise. We identified three causal pathways: (1) a direct pathway representing the effects of flooding on soil moisture, (2) a direct pathway representing the effects of salinity on decomposer microbial communities and soil biogeochemistry, and (3) an indirect pathway representing the effects of salinity on litter quality through changes in plant community composition over time. We used this model to test the effects of alternate scenarios on the response of tidal freshwater forested wetlands and oligohaline marshes to short- and long-term climate-induced disturbances of flooding and salinity. In tidal freshwater forested wetlands, the model predicted less decomposition in response to drought, hurricane salinity pulsing, and long-term sea-level rise. In contrast, in the oligohaline marsh, the model predicted no change in response to drought and sea-level rise, and increased decomposition following a hurricane salinity pulse. Our results show that it is critical to consider the temporal scale of disturbance and the magnitude of exposure when assessing the effects of salinity intrusion on carbon mineralization in coastal wetlands. Here, we identify three causal mechanisms that can reconcile disparities between long-term and short-term salinity impacts on organic matter decomposition.

TI  - Short-term seawater inundation induces metal mobilisation in freshwater and acid sulfate soil environments
AB  - Climate change is leading to global sea level rise. Storm surges and higher tides will generate short-term `pulses' of seawater into freshwater systems, often for the first time in over 3000 years. The effect of increased seawater inundation upon soil geochemistry is poorly understood. We identified 12 sites in South Australia which are predicted to be inundated by seawater storm surges in the next 20 years. Within these 12 sites are three distinct environments; fresh water streams and lakes, hypersaline saltmarsh and mangroves, and acid sulfate soils. Soils were inundated with seawater under laboratory conditions to replicate a short-term (two weeks) inundation by a storm surge. Lowering of redox potential and dissolution of high concentrations of reactive Mn and Fe in freshwater environments lead to the release of dissolved Fe and Mn in the soils from freshwater environments. Soils also released As, Cu, Ni, Cd and Co, while Zn and Pb were less mobilised. Concentrations of metals released exceeded water quality guidelines to protect freshwater aquatic ecosystems in most cases. By comparison, hypersaline soils only released minor amounts of Mn, Fe, Cd and Ni, and only in some of the soils. The moderately acidic acid sulfate soil (pH 5.41) reductively dissolved Mn and Fe releasing significant amount of Fe and Mn as well as As, Cu, Ni, Cd and Co, whereas almost all metal species decreased in the porewaters of the strongly acidic acid sulfate soil (pH 2.77). The response to short-term seawater inundation in acid sulfate soils was dependent upon the baseline soil acidification status. This study highlights the need for further research on seawater inundation of coastal soils as sea levels rise and storm surges penetrate further inland.

TI  - Contrasting effects of nutrient enrichment on below-ground biomass in coastal wetlands
AB  - 1. Anthropogenically enhanced nutrient availability is often cited among the most important drivers of altered ecosystem function and loss of services world-wide. Although the above-ground consequences of nutrient enrichment on plant growth patterns are numerous and well documented, below-ground impacts are less clear but nonetheless critical from a global change perspective. In coastal wetlands, for example, plant-soil-nutrient dynamics directly affect the capacity to sequester carbon as soil organic matter, keep pace with sea level rise and resist storm-induced erosion. 2. Here, we investigate the effects of excess nutrient loading on below-ground plant growth in an oligohaline marsh fertilized for 7 years with a factorial combination of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). We used two common assessment procedures, the ingrowth and standing crop methods, to simultaneously quantify distinct aspects of below-ground plant growth, which are (i) below-ground biomass accumulation into unexploited open resource space and (ii) in situ, or maintenance, below-ground biomass of plants in equilibrium with their environment, respectively. Our objective was to determine if plant growth responses to nutrient enrichment differed depending on process and/or biomass component measured. 3. We show that excess N concurrently increased live root biomass accumulation in ingrowth cores and reduced in situ live root standing crop. Similar, albeit non-significant, response trajectories were apparent for other below-ground biomass pools using both methods, excepting dead biomass and total standing crop. A review of previously published research supports our results and suggests that nutrient enrichment consistently has contrasting effects on below-ground plant growth depending on whether biomass accumulation or standing crop is measured, and that living biomass components are most responsive to enhanced nutrient availability. 4. Synthesis. We conclude that eutrophic conditions can be both beneficial and detrimental to ecosystem function by either stimulating below-ground biomass accumulation in unexploited soil or reducing the below-ground standing crop required to sustain the nutritional needs of established plants in mature communities. Thus, nutrient enrichment may, in the short-term, contribute to soil organic matter (i.e. carbon) accumulation by increasing below-ground growth as plants exploit new resource space. Over the long-term, however, nutrient enrichment has the potential to negatively impact soil organic matter content as plants equilibrate to excess nutrient availability by down-regulating below-ground standing crop.

TI  - Carbon sequestration potential of a Phragmites salt marsh in the liaohe river estuarine wetland
AB  - Enhancing the carbon sink of terrestrial ecosystems has been suggested as a useful measure to ameliorate the greenhouse effect. Estuarine wetlands, characterized by high net primary productivity (NPP), have the highest carbon sequestration reported for terrestrial ecosystems. However, owing to the dynamic and complex environmental factors in estuarine wetlands, the enhancement of their carbon sink has not been well documented, and the amount of the carbon sequestration potential of estuarine wetlands remains unknown. Therefore, it is fundamental to investigate the carbon sequestration potential of estuarine wetlands to assess and enhance their carbon sink. The main objective of this study was to investigate the carbon sequestration potential of plants for Phragmites salt marshes in the Liaohe River estuarine wetland using field observations and numerical modeling. According to the practice managements and environmental characteristics in the Liaohe River estuarine wetland, the carbon sequestration potential of plants can be classified by wetland plant succession, Phragmites field irrigation, and the effect of climate change. The carbon sequestration potential of plant succession was calculated using the area expansion by tidal deposition and NPP. The ratio of tidal deposition was obtained from the LiaoNing Province Geological Monitoring Report, and the NPP was observed at field sampling sites. The carbon sequestration potential of Phragmites field irrigation was determined by the area of Phragmites fields and the maximum Phragmites NPP, which was modeled with the relationship between NPP and soil moisture, salinity, and irrigation depth. Soil moisture and salinity were measured using a WET Sensor, and irrigation depth was obtained from the Liaohe River Estuarine Wetland Management Office. The carbon sequestration potential of climate change was modeled using the Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model. The parameters in the CASA model were measured using a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data product and meteorological variables, including air temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation, which were obtained from predicted results under projected climate change scenarios. The results suggested that the Phragmites salt marsh in the Liaohe River estuarine wetland has very high carbon sequestration potential, which could be enhanced by wetland succession and irrigation under the influence of the projected climate change in the future. NPP will be increased progressively by 53.18-70.91 MgC annually owing to the expansion of the Suaeda pterantha salt marsh, and by 70.32 MgC annually owing to the conversion of the tidal flat to a Phragmites salt marsh. It will increase by 17.2 GgC annually owing to the succession of Aeluropus littoralis meadows to Phragmites salt marshes, and by 0.47-0.54 TgC annually owing to the irrigation of Phragmites fields. The NPP of Phragmites salt marshes will increase to 1.33-1.49 TgC in 2030, which is 0.58-0.66 TgC higher than that in 2011. More than 94% of the carbon sequestration potential is a result of Phragmites field irrigation, whereas only 3.2% and 2.4% are a result of plant succession, and climate change, respectively. In 2050, the NPP of Phragmites salt marshes will increase by 0.61-0.68 TgC. The contribution of irrigation will decease to 90%, whereas the contribution of climate change will increase to 6% since the increasing temperature is favorable for plant photosynthesis. The NPP of Phragmites salt marshes will increase to 1.43-1.6 TgC in 2100, which is 0.68-0.77 TgC higher than that in 2011. The contribution of irrigation will decease to 80%, whereas the contribution of climate change will increase to 15%. Â© 2017, Ecological Society of China. All rights reserved.

TI  - Carbon stocks of mangroves and salt marshes of the Amazon region, Brazil
AB  - In addition to the largest existing expanse of tropical forests, the Brazilian Amazon has among the largest area of mangroves in the world. While recognized as important global carbon sinks that, when disturbed, are significant sources of greenhouse gases, no studies have quantified the carbon stocks of these vast mangrove forests. In this paper, we quantified total ecosystem carbon stocks of mangroves and salt marshes east of the mouth of the Amazon River, Brazil. Mean ecosystem carbon stocks of the salt marshes were 257 Mg C ha(-1) while those of mangroves ranged from 361 to 746 Mg C ha(-1). Although aboveground mass was high relative to many other mangrove forests (145 Mg C ha(-1)), soil carbon stocks were relatively low (340 Mg C ha(-1)). Low soil carbon stocks may be related to coarse textured soils coupled with a high tidal range. Nevertheless, the carbon stocks of the Amazon mangroves were over twice those of upland evergreen forests and almost 10-fold those of tropical dry forests.

TI  - Invasion chronosequence of Spartina alterniflora on methane emission and organic carbon sequestration in a coastal salt marsh
AB  - Spartina alterniflora was intentionally introduced to China in 1979 for the purpose of sediment stabilization and dike protection, and has continuously replaced native plants or invaded bare mudflats in the coastal marsh. To evaluate the spatial variation of CH4 emission and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage along the invasion chronosequence, we selected four sites including bare mudflat (Control, as first year invasion), and marshes invaded by S. alterniflora in 2002 (SA-1), 1999 (SA-2) and 1995 (SA-3), respectively, in Sheyang county, Jiangsu, China and set up the marsh mesocosm system for flux measurement. The mean accumulation rate of SOC in the 0-30 cm layer exponentially increased with the invasion time, ranging from 1.08 (over the first 9 years) to 235 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (over the period of 12-16 years). The cumulative CH4 emission during the growth season was 20.5, 75.4, 81.0 and 92.2 kg CH4 ha(-1) in Control, SA-1, SA-2 and SA-3, respectively, and there was a binomial relationship between CH4 emission and invasion time. Cumulative CH4 emission was logarithmically increased with SOC concentration; however the ratio of CH4 emission to SOC concentration was inversely correlated with the invasion time in the S. alterniflora marsh, suggesting that the less increased SOC in the S. alterniflora marsh was converted into CH4. The net global warming potential (GWP) was estimated at 733 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) in the tidal mudflat and reduced to -1273 (SA-1) to -2233 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) (SA-3) in the S. alterniflora marsh. Our results indicated that S. alterniflora invasion effectively sequestrated atmospheric CO2 and mitigated GWP in the coastal marsh of China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Geochemical analyses reveal the importance of environmental history for blue carbon sequestration
AB  - Coastal habitats including saltmarshes and mangrove forests can accumulate and store significant blue carbon stocks, which may persist for millennia. Despite this implied stability, the distribution and structure of intertidal-supratidal wetlands are known to respond to changes imposed by geomorphic evolution, climatic, sea level, and anthropogenic influences. In this study, we reconstruct environmental histories and biogeochemical conditions in four wetlands of similar contemporary vegetation in SE Australia. The objective is to assess the importance of historic factors to contemporary organic carbon (C) stocks and accumulation rates. Results from the four corestwo collected from marine-influenced saltmarshes (Wapengo marine site (WAP-M) and Port Stephens marine site (POR-M)) and two from fluvial influenced saltmarshes (Wapengo fluvial site (WAP-F) and Port Stephens fluvial site (POR-F))highlight different environmental histories and preservation conditions. High C stocks are associated with the presence of a mangrove phase below the contemporary saltmarsh sediments in the POR-M and POR-F cores. C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance analyses show this historic mangrove root C to be remarkably stable in its molecular composition despite its age, consistent with its position in deep sediments. WAP-M and WAP-F cores did not contain mangrove root C; however, significant preservation of char C (up to 46\% of C in some depths) in WAP-F reveals the importance of historic catchment processes to this site. Together, these results highlight the importance of integrating historic ecosystem and catchment factors into attempts to upscale C accounting to broader spatial scales.

TI  - Model selection in Bayesian framework to identify the best WorldView-2 based vegetation index in predicting green biomass of salt marshes in the northern Gulf of Mexico
AB  - Coastal wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems globally but have experienced dramatic degradation and loss within the past several decades. Vegetation biomass of coastal wetlands is not only the key component of blue carbon storage but also plays an important role in vertical accretion, important for maintaining these habitats under relative sea-level rise. Remote sensing offers a cost-effective approach to study vegetation biomass at a broad spatial scale. We developed statistical models to predict peak aboveground green biomass of Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus, two dominant species of salt marshes using WorldView-2 satellite imagery at the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) on the Mississippi coast in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The model accounted for nested data structures in the sampled biomass, assimilated uncertainties from data, parameters and model structures, and helped determine the best vegetation index among a variety of commonly-used indices to predict aboveground green biomass. We developed a series of mixed-effects models, which included different combinations of fixed effect(s), random intercept, and random slope(s). The fixed effects were species and one of the 60 vegetation indices derived from a WorldView-2 image obtained on 6 October 2012. The random effect used was site. We implemented the models in a Bayesian framework and selected the best model structure and vegetation index based on minimum posterior predictive loss and deviance information criterion. The results showed that the best vegetation index to predict peak green biomass was the green chlorophyll index derived from the reflectance values of band 8 (near-infrared) and band 3 (green), and its effect on biomass prediction varied among sites. The inclusion of species as a fixed effect improved the model prediction. The study demonstrated the need to account for spatial dependence of data in developing a robust model, and the importance of the second WorldView-2 near-infrared band (860-1040nm) in predicting aboveground green biomass for the Grand Bay NERR. The analysis using mixed-effects modeling in Bayesian inference which coherently combined field and WorldView-2 data with uncertainties accounted for provides a robust and nondestructive tool for resource managers to monitor the status of coastal wetlands at a high spatial resolution in a timely manner. Through this study, we hope to emphasize the importance of appropriately accounting for nested data structures using mixed-effects models and promote wider application of Bayesian inference to facilitate assimilation of uncertainties in remote sensing applications.

TI  - Salt Marsh Carbon Pool Distribution in a Mid-Atlantic Lagoon, USA: Sea Level Rise Implications
AB  - The distribution of carbon (C) within a salt marsh may vary among vegetation zones depending on production and decomposition dynamics and organic and mineral depositional history. We examined spatial and temporal variation of plant and soil C pools within a salt marsh fringing a coastal lagoon along the mid-Atlantic coast of the U. S. The total plant C pool increased from high marsh shrub to low marsh grass dominated areas. Much of the spatial variation in plant C pool was due to fine roots and small organic matter (dlm) that could not be identified by species, which averaged 2398 gC m(-2) in Spartina patens-dominated, 2215 gC m(-2) in Spartina alterniflora-dominated, and 676 gC m-2 in Juncus roemerianus-dominated areas. Belowground C pool loss was 36\% less for S. patens than S. alterniflora and was similar between S. alterniflora and J. roemerianus. Accretion and C accumulation rates were greater in the S. alterniflora-dominated stand than in the J. roemerianus-dominated stand. Our results suggest that landward migration onto terrestrial soils can lead to an estimated 80\% increase in belowground plant C composed primarily of fine roots and dlm and 36-70\% increase in soil carbon between 15 and 30 cm depths.

TI  - Coastal wetland response to sea level rise in Connecticut and New York
AB  - The persistence of salt marshes in the landscape depends on their ability to accommodate rising sea level and minimize additional flooding stress. We use sediment cores and water level data from 14 marshes in Connecticut and New York to evaluate how marsh accretion, mineral and organic accumulation, carbon storage, and hydroperiod have changed from 1900 to 2012. We observe a regional acceleration in marsh accretion beginning around 1940, although marsh accretion did not reach parity with sea level rise for several additional decades. Despite a rise in marsh accretion from 1.0mmyr-1 circa 1900 to 3.6mmyr-1 at present, the marsh surface has lost elevation relative to tidal datums. Declining relative elevations have led to increased tidal flooding, particularly in high marsh settings. As flooding increased, organic matter accumulation accelerated at all marshes. Accelerating mineral deposition was only observed in areas of short-form Spartina alterniflora. Mineral and organic sediment accumulation co-limit accretion, but organic accumulation was the stronger limiting factor, suggesting that marsh response to sea level rise in the region is sensitive to processes affecting rates of belowground production and decomposition. Marsh carbon storage over the period of study averaged 84gCm-2yr-1, increasing as accretion accelerated. If marshes remain spatially intact as sea levels rise, these results suggest that marshes have the capacity to become even greater C sinks. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Tidal Marsh Restoration at Poplar Island: II. Elevation Trends, Vegetation Development, and Carbon Dynamics
AB  - In natural tidal marshes, nutrient fertilization stimulates complex responses, bringing into question the suitability of nutrient-rich dredged material as a substrate for tidal marsh restoration. We examined vegetation and elevation trends in the constructed tidal marshes at Poplar Island, Maryland where fine-grained dredged material (high nutrient) and locally dredged sand (low nutrient) were used as substrates. Macrophyte production was higher and root:shoot ratios lower in dredged material marshes. Measured vertical accretion was similar in dredged material (7.4 +/- 0.6 mm y(-1)) and sand (6.4 +/- 0.9 mm y(-1)) marshes, and is keeping pace with local sea-level rise. A detailed carbon budget was developed for one dredged material marsh to examine carbon dynamics under high nutrient availability. High annual macrophyte production combined with small exports via tidal exchange and methane emissions resulted in an annual carbon burial of 206 g C m(-2) y(-1), and calculated vertical accretion of 6.5 mm y(-1) from organic matter. This is attributed to the contribution of organic matter from aboveground biomass due to protection from perimeter dikes constructed to contain dredged material during placement, reducing marsh exposure and organic matter export. With appropriate design and management, fine-grained, high-nutrient dredged material makes a suitable substrate for tidal marsh restoration.

TI  - Underestimated PAH accumulation potential of blue carbon vegetation: Evidence from sedimentary records of saltmarsh and mangrove in Yueqing Bay, China
AB  - Sediments of blue carbon vegetation are becoming a sink of natural and anthropogenic pollutants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). However, the extent to which PAHs are accumulated and varied in blue carbon sediments, and the impact of blue carbon vegetation on the accumulation and retention capacity of PAHs, have been poorly explored. This study examines the sedimentary records of PAHs in profiles from mangrove plantation, saltmarsh, and mudflat in Ximen Island and Maoyan Island of Yueqing Bay, China. The existence of blue carbon vegetation provides a sheltered environment for the accelerated burial of sediment and OC. Decadal PAH sedimentation records show staged changes characterized by the emission of PAHs and colonization of blue carbon vegetation, reflecting the accelerated burial of PAHs in sediments by blue carbon vegetation colonization. In addition, the colonization of blue carbon vegetation contributes to the shift of PAH compositions in sediments. This study provides new insights into the underestimated PAH accumulation potential and retention capacity of blue carbon vegetation and the corresponding underlying sediments, supporting the environmental benefits of blue carbon vegetation.

TI  - Effects of waterlogging and elevated salinity on the allocation of photosynthetic carbon in estuarine tidal marsh: a mesocosm experiment
AB  - Background and aim Coastal marshes and wetlands hosting blue carbon ecosystems have shown vulnerability to sea-level rise (SLR) and its consequent effects. In this study, we explored the effects of waterlogging and elevated salinity on the accumulation and allocation of photosynthetic carbon (C) in a widely distributed species in marsh lands. Methods The plant-soil mesocosms of Phragmites australis were grown under waterlogging and elevated salinity conditions to investigate the responses of photosynthetic C allocation in different C pools (plant organs and soils) based on (CO2)-C-13 pulse-labeling technology. Results Both waterlogging and elevated salinity treatments decreased photosynthetic C fixation. The hydrological treatments also reduced C-13 transport to the plant organs of P. australis while significantly increased C-13 allocation percentage in roots. Waterlogging and low salinity had no significant effects on C-13 allocation to rhizosphere soils, while high salinity (15 and 30 ppt) significantly reduced C-13 allocation to soils, indicating a decreased root C export in saline environments. Waterlogging enhanced the effects of salinity on the C-13 allocation pattern, particularly during the late growing season. The responses of flooding and elevated salinity on C allocation in plant organs and rhizosphere soils can be related to changes in nutrient, ionic concentrations and microbial biomass. Conclusion The adaptation strategy of P. australis led to increased C allocation in belowground organs under changed hydrology. Expected global SLR projection might decrease total C stocks in P. australis and alter the C allocation pattern in marsh plant-soil systems, due to amplified effects of flooding and elevated salinities.

TI  - Tidal restoration to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from freshwater impounded coastal wetlands
AB  - Freshwater impounded wetlands are created by artificially restricting coastal wetlands connection to tides. The decrease in salinity and altered hydrology can significantly increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, specifically methane (CH4). Restoration of freshwater impounded wetlands through tidal reintroduction can potentially reduce GHG emissions; however, studies in tropical regions are scare. This study investigates the potential for tidal restoration of impounded freshwater coastal wetlands by comparing their GHG emissions with tidally connected mangrove and saltmarshes in the Burdekin catchment in Queensland, Australia. We found that freshwater impounded wetlands had significantly higher CH4 emissions (3,633 Â± 812 Î¼g CH4Â mâˆ’2Â hourâˆ’1) than mangroves (27 Â± 8Â Î¼g CH4Â mâˆ’2Â hourâˆ’1) and saltmarsh (13 Â± 8Â Î¼g CH4Â mâˆ’2Â hourâˆ’1). Soil redox, moisture, carbon, nitrogen, and bulk density were all significantly correlated to methane emissions. Conversely, freshwater impounded wetlands had significantly lower nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions (âˆ’0.72 Â± 0.18 Î¼g N2O mâˆ’2Â hourâˆ’1) than mangroves and saltmarsh (0.35 Â± 0.29 and 1.32 Â± 0.52 Î¼g N2O mâˆ’2Â hourâˆ’1 respectively). Nevertheless, when converting to CO2 equivalents (CO2-eq), freshwater impounded wetlands emitted 91 Â± 20 g CO2-eq mâˆ’2Â hourâˆ’1, compared to the much lower 0.8 Â± 0.2 and 0.7 Â± 0.2Â g CO2-eq mâˆ’2Â hourâˆ’1 emission rates for mangroves and saltmarsh. In conclusion, restoration of freshwater impounded wetlands through tidal restoration is likely to result in reduced GHG emissions. Â© 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Local geomorphological gradients affect sedimentary organic carbon storage: A Blue Carbon case study from sub-tropical Australia
AB  - Coastal blue carbon systems (mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and tidal saltmarshes) are renowned for their efficacy at sequestering large amounts of carbon (C) in sedimentary sinks and effective management action to preserve these C stocks requires an understanding of spatial variability within an estuary. This study analysed 33 coastal blue carbon sediment cores across three subtropical estuaries of Eastern Australia. We measured depth, C content and dry bulk density down the soil profile. Mean C stocks for mangroves, seagrass and saltmarsh, up to a 3 metre depth, were estimated to be 738 +/- 119, 439 +/- 72, and 823 +/- 138 Mg C ha(-1), respectively. Linear regression models showed the relationship between distance from ocean and C stocks was significant in mangroves and saltmarsh (p <= 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively), with the exception of mangroves in an urbanised estuary which displayed the inverse. The differences we observed in C stocks in mangroves and saltmarsh, not seagrass, in relation to location within the estuary may have important implications for management actions and ecological processes.

TI  - Modeling of carbon sequestration in coastal marsh soils
AB  - Two transects were established across submerging coastal landscapes in Dorchester County, Maryland. Extensive sampling protocol was performed along the submerging upland tidal marsh soils to model C sequestration. Coastal marsh soils are accreting vertically and migrating laterally over the low-lying forest soils to keep pace with sea-level rise. The predictive C sequestration model was a two-step linear function. Therefore, C sequestration will continue to occur by accumulation in the organic horizons and sea-level rise is the driving force. During the last 150 yr, the rate of C sequestration averaged 83.5 Â± 23 g m-2 yr-1. Before the last few hundred years, the predicted long-term rate of C sequestration averaged 29.2 Â± 5.35 g m-2 yr-1. Sampling protocol and model validation ascertain the validity of the model and placed 80% confidence and 10% accuracy on rates of C sequestration and the predictive model. The model indicated that coastal marsh soils have higher C storage capacity than upland forest soils, and soils in the Cumulic subgroup of Mollisols. In general, C storage in mineral soils tends to reach a steady-state condition, whereas C sequestration in coastal marsh soils is a continuous phenomenon. During the next century, future C sequestration in the newly formed coastal marsh soils averaged 400 Â± 162 g m-2 yr-1. Modeling C sequestration in coastal marsh ecosystems indicated that C storage under positive accretionary balance acts as a negative feedback mechanism to global warming.

TI  - Tidal marsh plant responses to elevated CO2, nitrogen fertilization, and sea level rise
AB  - Elevated CO2 and nitrogen (N) addition directly affect plant productivity and the mechanisms that allow tidal marshes to maintain a constant elevation relative to sea level, but it remains unknown how these global change drivers modify marsh plant response to sea level rise. Here we manipulated factorial combinations of CO2 concentration (two levels), N availability (two levels) and relative sea level (six levels) using in situ mesocosms containing a tidal marsh community composed of a sedge, Schoenoplectus americanus, and a grass, Spartina patens. Our objective is to determine, if elevated CO2 and N alter the growth and persistence of these plants in coastal ecosystems facing rising sea levels. After two growing seasons, we found that N addition enhanced plant growth particularly at sea levels where plants were most stressed by flooding (114\% stimulation in the+10cm treatment), and N effects were generally larger in combination with elevated CO2 (288\% stimulation). N fertilization shifted the optimal productivity of S. patens to a higher sea level, but did not confer S. patens an enhanced ability to tolerate sea level rise. S. americanus responded strongly to N only in the higher sea level treatments that excluded S. patens. Interestingly, addition of N, which has been suggested to accelerate marsh loss, may afford some marsh plants, such as the widespread sedge, S. americanus, the enhanced ability to tolerate inundation. However, if chronic N pollution reduces the availability of propagules of S. americanus or other flood-tolerant species on the landscape scale, this shift in species dominance could render tidal marshes more susceptible to marsh collapse.

TI  - The Science and Policy of the Verified Carbon Standard Methodology for Tidal Wetland and Seagrass Restoration
AB  - The restoration of tidal wetland and seagrass systems has the potential for significant greenhouse gas benefits, but project-level accounting procedures have not been available at an international scale. In this paper, we describe the Verified Carbon Standard Methodology for Tidal Wetland and Seagrass Restoration, which provides greenhouse gas accounting procedures for marsh, mangrove, tidal forested wetland, and seagrasses systems across a diversity of geomorphic conditions and restoration techniques. We discuss and critique the essential science and policy elements of the methodology and underlying knowledge gaps. We developed a method for estimating mineral-protected (recalcitrant) allochthonous carbon in tidal wetland systems using field-collected soils data and literature-derived default values of the recalcitrant carbon that accompanies mineral deposition. We provided default values for methane emissions from polyhaline soils but did not provide default values for freshwater, oligohaline, and mesohaline soils due to high variability of emissions in these systems. Additional topics covered are soil carbon sequestration default values, soil carbon fate following erosion, avoided losses in organic and mineral soils, nitrous oxide emissions, soil profile sampling methods, sample size, prescribed fire, additionality, and leakage. Knowledge gaps that limit the application of the methodology include the estimation of CH4 emissions from fresh and brackish tidal wetlands, lack of validation of our approach for the estimation of recalcitrant allochthonous carbon, understanding of carbon oxidation rates following drainage of mineral tidal wetland soils, estimation of the effects of prescribed fire on soil carbon stocks, and the analysis of additionality for projects outside of the USA.

TI  - Aboveground biomass and its spatial distribution pattern of herbaceous marsh vegetation in China
AB  - Herbaceous marsh is the most widely distributed type of marsh wetland ecosystem, and has important ecological functions such as water conservation, climate regulation, carbon storage and fixation, and sheltering rare species. The carbon sequestration function of herbaceous marsh plays a key role in slowing climate warming and maintaining regional environmental stability. Vegetation biomass is an important index reflecting the carbon sequestration capacity of wetlands. Investigating the biomass of marsh vegetation can provide a scientific basis for estimating the carbon storage and carbon sequestration capacity of marshes. Based on field survey data of aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation and the distribution data set of marsh in China, we analyzed the aboveground biomass and its spatial distribution pattern of herbaceous marsh on a national scale for the first time. The results showed that in China the total area of herbaceous marsh was 9.7x10(4) km(2), the average density of aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation was 227.5 +/- 23.0 g C m(-2) (95\% confidence interval, the same below), and the total aboveground biomass was 22.2 +/- 2.2 Tg C (1 Tg=10(12) g). The aboveground biomass density of herbaceous marsh vegetation is generally low in Northeast China and the Tibetan Plateau, and high in central North China and coastal regions in China. In different marsh distribution regions of China, the average biomass density of herbaceous marsh vegetation from small to large was as follows: temperate humid and semi-humid marsh region (182.3 +/- 49.3 g C m(-2))<Tibetan Plateau marsh region (243.9 +/- 26.6 g C m(-2))<temperate arid and semi-arid marsh region (300.5 +/- 73.2 g C m(-2))<subtropical humid marsh region (348.4 +/- 59.0 g C m(-2))<coastal marsh region (675.4 +/- 73.8 g C m(-2)). Due to the different area of herbaceous marsh, the total above-ground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in different marsh distribution regions was the largest in the temperate humid and semi-humid marsh region (9.6 +/- 2.6 Tg C), and was the smallest in the coastal marsh region (1.1 +/- 0.1 Tg C). The spatial distribution of aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in China has obvious non-zonality characteristics, but also presents certain zonality in some regions. The aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in the Tibetan Plateau decreased with the increase of altitude. With the aggravation of drought, the aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in temperate humid and semi-humid regions and temperate arid and semi-arid regions decreased first and then did not obviously change. The aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in temperate humid and semi-humid regions was relatively larger in the regions with higher average annual temperature. The results can provide scientific basis for accurately evaluating the adjustment action of wetland ecosystems on climate, and provide decision support for adaptive management of wetland ecosystems.

TI  - Biophysical drivers of net ecosystem and methane exchange across phenological phases in a tidal salt marsh
AB  - Salt marshes are large carbon reservoirs as part of blue carbon ecosystems. Unfortunately, there is limited information about the net ecosystem (NEE) and methane (CH4) exchange between salt marshes and the atmosphere to fully understand their carbon dynamics. We tested the influence of biophysical drivers by plant phenological phases (i.e., Greenup, Maturity, Senescence and Dormancy) on NEE and CH4 exchange in a grass-dominated temperate tidal salt marsh. We used three years of data derived from eddy covariance, PhenoCam (to measure vegetation phenology), and ancillary meteorological and water/soil variables. Overall, NEE showed significant differences among all phenological phases (p < 0.05), while CH4 exchange had significant differences among all phases except for Greenup and Dormancy. Net CO2 uptake was higher across Maturity (-61 g C-CO2 m(2)), while CO2 emissions were higher during Dormancy (182 g C-CO2 m(2)). The lower but constant CO2 emissions during Dormancy overshadowed the CO2 uptake during the growing season and contributed to >72\% of the annual CO2 emissions in this ecosystem. Net CH4 emissions were higher during Maturity (3.7 g C-CH4 m(2)) and Senescence (4.2 g C-CH4 m(2)). Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) substantially influenced (r(2) > 0.57) daytime NEE across phenological phases, but a combination of variables including water table level (WTL), water temperature and atmospheric pressure were relevant to explain CH4 exchange. The study site was an overall net carbon source to the atmosphere with annual emissions of 13-201 g C-CO2 m(-2)yr(-1) and 8.5-15.2 g C-CH4 m(-2)yr(-1). Our findings provide insights on: a) the role of plant phenological phases on ecosystem-scale CO2 and CH4 fluxes; b) challenges for modeling ecosystem-scale CO2 and CH4 fluxes in salt marshes; and c) the potential net loss of carbon to the atmosphere that should be considered for carbon management and accounting in these ecosystems.

TI  - Delaware Bay salt marsh restoration: Mitigation for a power plant cooling water system in New Jersey, USA
AB  - In 1994 Public Service Electric and Gas of New Jersey (PSE\&G), now Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG), proposed and implemented a program to offset egg, larvae and fish losses at the cooling water intake at Salem Generating Station. The program included wetland habitat restoration, fish ladder installation, new cooling water intake technology, and a biological monitoring program. The wetland habitat restoration was the core component and the most controversial aspect of the program. It addressed two types of habitats: diked salt hay farms and wetlands dominated by Phragmites australis. The wetland restoration program used ecological engineering principles to restore approximately 4550 ha. It also protected upland buffers and other lands for a total of over 8700 ha. Eight fish ladders were installed to allow anadromous river herring to return to previously blocked spawning habitat. PSEG also implemented operational changes, installed advanced cooling water intake technology to reduce losses of invertebrates and early life stages of fish, and conducted studies of behavioral deterrents. The biological monitoring program continues to assess the abundance and distribution of juvenile coastal migratory fish species while they are in the Delaware River Estuary; it also monitors use of wetlands by fish and invertebrates.

TI  - The Contribution of Subtidal Seagrass Meadows to the Total Carbon Stocks of Gazi Bay, Kenya
AB  - Seagrass beds occur globally in both intertidal and subtidal zones within shallow marine environments, such as bays and estuaries. These important ecosystems support fisheries production, attenuate strong wave energies, support human livelihoods and sequester large amounts of CO2 that may help mitigate the effects of climate change. At present, there is increased global interest in understanding how these ecosystems could help alleviate the challenges likely to face humanity and the environment into the future. Unlike other blue carbon ecosystems, i.e., mangroves and saltmarshes, seagrasses are less understood, especially regarding their contribution to the carbon dynamics. This is particularly true in regions with less attention and limited resources. Paucity of information is even more relevant for the subtidal meadows that are less accessible. In Kenya, much of the available information on seagrasses comes from Gazi Bay, where the focus has been on the extensive intertidal meadows. As is the case with other regions, there remains a paucity of information on subtidal meadows. This limits our understanding of the overall contribution of seagrasses in carbon capture and storage. This study provides the first assessment of the species composition and variation in carbon storage capacity of subtidal seagrass meadows within Gazi Bay. Nine seagrass species, comprising of Cymodocea rotundata, Cymodocea serrulata, Enhalus acoroides, Halodule uninervis, Halophila ovalis, Halophila stipulacea, Syringodium isoetifolium, Thalassia hemprichii, and Thalassodendron ciliatum, were found. Organic carbon stocks varied between species and pools, with the mean below ground vegetation carbon (bgc) stocks (5.1 +/- 0.7 Mg C ha(-1)) being more than three times greater than above ground carbon (agc) stocks (0.5 +/- 0.1 Mg C ha(-1)). Mean sediment organic carbon stock (sed C-org) of the subtidal seagrass beds was 113 +/- 8 Mg C ha(-1). Combining this new knowledge with existing data from the intertidal and mangrove fringed areas, we estimate the total seagrass ecosystem organic carbon stocks in the bay to be 196,721 Mg C, with the intertidal seagrasses storing about 119,790 Mg C (61\%), followed by the subtidal seagrasses 55,742 Mg C (28\%) and seagrasses in the mangrove fringed creeks storing 21,189 Mg C (11\%). These findings are important in highlighting the need to protect subtidal seagrass meadows and for building a national and global data base on seagrass contribution to global carbon dynamics.

TI  - Enrichment of trace elements by blue carbon habitats in Maoyan Island of Yueqing Bay, China
AB  - Mangroves and saltmarshes are coastal blue carbon ecosystems with important eco-environmental functions. In this study, profile samples from five habitats (mangrove, saltmarsh, mudflat, paddy field, and mountain forest) were collected in the Maoyan Island of Yueqing Bay, China, to measure the concentrations of trace elements (TEs) (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Ti, and Zn) among the five ecosystems and to assess their hazardous potentials on the environment. Our results showed that, compared to other sites, concentrations of TEs (except Cd, Pb, and Zn) in mangrove sediment were higher at the top 50Â cm of the profile. Besides, significant enrichment of most of the TEs (except Cd, Ni, and Pb) in mangrove and Cd, Pb, and Zn in saltmarsh sediment was observed after the colonization of mangrove and saltmarsh vegetation. Correlation and principal component analysis suggested that the Co, Fe, Mn, and Ti in mangrove, saltmarsh, and mudflat sediments mainly derived from natural sources; whereas Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn possibly came from both natural and anthropogenic sources. The results of contamination indices showed that there was no serious prevalence of TEs (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) contamination across the sedimentary profile of all habitats, and the potential hazards of these six elements were low. This study indicates that coastal blue carbon ecosystems not only sequester a considerable amount of carbon but also enrich a substantial portion of trace elements that can minimize the adverse impacts of TEs on marine environments.

TI  - Carbon accumulation rates are highest at young and expanding salt marsh edges
AB  - Colonization by vegetation governs variability in carbon accumulation rates in salt marshes, suggesting that accelerating sea level rise will enhance their carbon sequestration through landward expansion, according to carbon analysis and dating of cores from seven marshes in North Carolina An objective of salt marsh conservation, restoration, and creation is to reduce global carbon dioxide levels and offset emissions. This strategy hinges on measurements of salt marsh carbon accumulation rates, which vary widely creating uncertainty in monetizing carbon credits. Here, we show the 14-323 g C m(-2) yr(-1) range of carbon accumulation rates, derived from cores collected at seven sites in North Carolina U.S.A., results from the landward or basinward trajectory of salt marsh colonization and the intertidal space available for accretion. Rates increase with accelerating sea-level rise and are highest at young and expanding marsh edges. The highest carbon densities are near the upland, highlighting the importance of this area for building a rich stock of carbon that would be prevented by upland development. Explaining variability in carbon accumulation rates clarifies appraisal of salt marsh restoration projects and landscape conversion, in terms of mitigating green-house gas emissions.

TI  - Carbon sequestration and biogeochemical cycling in a saltmarsh Subject to coastal managed realignment
AB  - Globally, wetlands provide the largest terrestrial carbon (C) store, and restoration of degraded wetlands provides a potentially important mechanism for climate change mitigation. We examined the potential for restored saltmarshes to sequester carbon, and found that they can provide a modest, but sustained, sink for atmospheric CO2. Rates of C and nutrient cycling were measured and compared between a natural saltmarsh (high- and low-shore locations), claimed arable land on former high-shore saltmarsh and a managed realignment restoration site (high- and low-shore) in transition from agricultural land to saltmarsh 15 years after realignment, at Tollesbury, Essex, UK. We measured pools and turnover of C and nitrogen (N) in soil and vegetation at each site using a range of methods, including gas flux measurement and isotopic labelling. The natural high-shore site had the highest soil organic matter concentrations, topsoil C stock and below-ground biomass, whereas the agricultural site had the highest total extractable N concentration and lowest soil C/N ratio. Ecosystem respiration rates were similar across all three high-shore sites, but much higher in both low-shore sites, which receive regular inputs of organic matter and nutrients from the estuary. Total evolution of C-14-isotopically labelled substrate as CO2 was highest at the agricultural site, suggesting that low observed respiration rates here were due to low substrate supply (following a recent harvest) rather than to inherently low microbial activity. The results suggest that, after 15 years, the managed realignment site is not fully equivalent to the natural saltmarsh in terms of biological and chemical function. While above ground biomass, extractable N and substrate mineralisation rates in the high-shore site were all quite similar to the natural site, less dynamic ecosystem properties including soil C stock, C/N ratio and below-ground biomass all remained more similar to the agricultural site. These results suggest that reversion to natural biogeochemical functioning will occur following restoration, but is likely to be slow; we estimate that it will take approximately 100 years for the restored site to accumulate the amount of C currently stored in the natural site, at a rate of 0.92 t C ha(-1) yr(-1).

TI  - Leveraging Carbon Services of Coastal Ecosystems for Habitat Protection and Restoration
AB  - Coastal ``blue carbon,{''} (carbon sequestered in salt marsh, mangroves, and seagrasses) is a newly recognized benefit. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), with partners, has been exploring and developing new policy opportunities for coastal conservation using the climate benefits of these ecosystems. We detail NOAA's efforts (federal and international, market and non-market) to leverage blue carbon for coastal conservation including: (1) how blue carbon is or could be incorporated into U.S. federal policies (both existing and new policy activities); (2) market-based policy solutions including the development of a Verified Carbon Standard methodology for carbon credits for wetland restoration and two landscape assessments of the climate mitigation benefits of watershed-scale restoration; and (3) international efforts to build a North American community of practice for blue carbon science and policy with the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, Canada, and Mexico, and an assessment of where blue carbon can be incorporated into international policy frameworks (including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Wetlands Supplement and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)). Protecting coastal carbon leads to co-benefits including resilience to storms and erosion, and fishery benefits, thus blue carbon is a ``triple win{'' for climate mitigation, adaptation, and conservation.

TI  - Influence of the conservation status on carbon balances of semiarid coastal Mediterranean wetlands
AB  - Permanent freshwater and brackish marshes are the typical wetland type of the Mediterranean Spanish coast. Historically, alterations to the original morphological and hydrological characteristics of some these ecosystems have increased their trophic status, which could influence the carbon (C) balance, while other ecosystems remain close to their natural condition. In this work, the main processes related to the C cycle were studied in several Mediterranean coastal marshes with different degrees of alteration and in sites restored and managed in different ways. Carbon associated with greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4) was determined using gas exchange methods for plankton, benthos, and sediments, as well as net production estimations for helophytes, to determine the influence of wetland conservation status, restoration, and management practices on C balances. Freshwater and brackish marshes showed capacity for C capture, especially in the restored sites (similar to 950g m(-2) yr(-1)), with a paramount role of helophytes. Differences among the study sites revealed the importance of alterations and restoration for C exchange. Specifically, a highly altered site showed increased rates of aerobic respiration compared to undisturbed sites, with a decrease in C storage capacity to similar to 50g m(-2) yr(-1). Management practices resulting in instability of the organic sediments favoured degradative metabolism, with release of stored C and concomitant increases in CH4 emissions. Our results indicate that the hydromorphological alterations in these sites may convert healthy ecosystems contributing to C sequestration and climate change mitigation into C-emitting ecosystems.

TI  - Salt marsh-atmosphere CO2 exchanges in Patos Lagoon Estuary, Southern Brazil
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems are recognized as carbon sinks and therefore for their potential for climate mitigation. While carbon stocks and burial rates have been quantified and estimated regionally and globally, there are still many knowledge gaps on carbon fluxes exchanged particularly at the interface vegetation-atmosphere. In this study we measured the atmospheric CO2 concentrations in a salt marsh located in the Patos Lagoon Estuary, southern Brazil. Eddy correlation techniques were applied to account for the CO2 exchange fluxes between the vegetation and the atmosphere. Our dataset refers to two sampling periods spanning from July up to November 2016 and from January to April 2017. By using time series analysis techniques including wavelet and cross-wavelet analysis, our results show the natural cycles of the CO2 exchanges variability and the relationship of these cycles with other environmental variables. We also present the amplitudes of the salt marsh-atmosphere CO2 fluxes' diurnal cycle for both study periods and demonstrate that the CO2 fluxes are modulated by the passage of transient atmospheric systems and by the level variation of surrounding waters. During daytime, our site was as a CO2 sink. Fluxes were measured as -6.71 +/- 5.55 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and -7.95 +/- 6.44 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for the winter-spring and summer-fall periods, respectively. During nighttime, the CO2 fluxes were reversed and our site behaved as a CO2 source. Beside the seasonal changes in sunlight and air temperature, differences between the two periods were marked by the level of marsh inundation, winds and plant biomass (higher in summer). The net CO2 balance showed the predominance of the photosynthetic activity over community respiration, indicating the role of the salt marsh as a CO2 sink. When considering the yearly-averaged net fluxes integrated to the whole area of the Patos Lagoon Estuary marshes, the total CO2 sink was estimated as -87.6 Mg C yr(-1). This paper is the first to measure and study the vegetation-atmosphere CO2 fluxes of a salt marsh environment of Brazil. The results will contribute to the knowledge on the global carbon budget and for marsh conservation and management plans, including climate change policies.

TI  - INTERACTIVE EFFECTS OF ATMOSPHERIC CO2 ENRICHMENT, SALINITY AND FLOODING ON GROWTH OF C-3 (ELYMUS-ATHERICUS) AND C-4 (SPARTINA-ANGLICA) SALT-MARSH SPECIES
AB  - The growth response of Dutch salt marsh species (C3 and C4) to atmospheric CO2 enrichment was investigated. Tillers of the C3 species Elymus athericus were grown in combinations of 380 and 720 mul l-1 CO2 and low (0) and high (300 mM NaCl) soil salinity. CO2 enrichment increased dry matter production and leaf area development while both parameters were reduced at high salinity. The relative growth response to CO2 enrichment was higher under saline conditions. Growth increase at elevated CO2 was higher after 34 than 71 days. A lower response to CO2 enrichment after 71 days was associated with a decreased specific leaf area (SLA). In two other experiments the effect of CO2 (380 and 720 mul l-1) on growth of the C4 species Spartina anglica was studied. In the first experiment total plant dry weight was reduced by 20\% at elevated CO2. SLA also decreased at high CO2. The effect of elevated CO2 was also studied in combination with soil salinity (50 and 400 mM NaCl) and flooding. Again plant weight was reduced (10\%) at elevated CO2, except under the combined treatment high salinity/non-flooded. But these effects were not significant. High salinity reduced total plant weight while flooding had no effect. Causes of the salinity-dependent effect of CO2 enrichment on growth and consequences of elevated CO2 for competition between C3 and C4 species are discussed.

TI  - CO2 Uptake Offsets Other Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Salt Marshes with Chronic Nitrogen Loading
AB  - Coastal wetlands are known for exceptional productivity, but they also receive intense land-based nitrogen (N) loading. In Narragansett Bay, RI (USA), coastal ecosystems have received anthropogenic N inputs from wastewater for more than two centuries. Greenhouse gas fluxes were studied throughout a growing season (2016) in three coastal wetlands with contrasting histories of nitrogen loading. The wetland with the highest historic N load (Mary's Creek, Warwick, RI) had significantly greater nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions than the other two sites. However, the two marshes with historic N loads (Mary's Creek and Mary Donovan, Little Compton, RI) also had greater rates of CO2 uptake than the reference site (Nag Marsh, Prudence Island, RI). Their CO2 uptake rates far outpaced their other greenhouse gas emissions. Mary's Creek had the greatest above- and below-ground plant biomass, vertical accretion rates, and carbon content of soils. Spartina alterniflora height was greatest at Mary's Creek and Mary Donovan marsh. The following growing season (2017), greenhouse gases were compared across four plant-defined ecological zones in Mary's Creek. Higher rates of CO2 uptake and CH4 emissions were found in the S. alterniflora-vegetated creekbank compared to high marsh zones or bare mudflats. Potential denitrifying enzyme activity did not significantly differ across the four zones nor between Mary's Creek and Nag Marsh, suggesting a consistently high capacity to completely reduce N loads. These results support efforts to protect and restore these coastal ecosystems for their carbon sequestration function even despite prevalence of anthropogenic N loading.

TI  - Land use changes and metal mobility: Multi-approach study on tidal marsh restoration in a contaminated estuary
AB  - Inundation of formerly embanked areas in order to combine flood control and tidal marsh restoration will be applied increasingly. However, areas suitable for the implementation are often found to be contaminated. Re-inundation of metal contaminated soils can have consequences on total metal concentrations as well as metal mobility. In this study, metal mobility in a tidal marsh restoration project was evaluated based on the modified BCR sequential extraction method, concentrations of acid volatile sulfides (AVS) and simultaneously extracted metals (SEM) and metal concentrations in plants. The results obtained from the sequential extraction suggest an increase in metal mobility following inundation due to the reduction of Fe and Mn oxides and the subsequent release of associated metals. However, the differences in results between sequential extraction and {[}SEM-AVS] may indicate that redistribution of the metals to the mobile fraction can be caused by sample processing. High AVS concentrations in newly deposited sediments in the restored marsh may indicate that the formation of insoluble metal-sulfide complexes will reduce metal mobility on the longer term. Processes following inundation of metal contaminated land are complex and different conditions prevailing in other sites or estuaries can result in different behavior of the trace metals. More in situ research is needed to get a better insight in the risks involved. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effect of tidal action and drying-wetting cycles on carbon exchange in a salt marsh: Progress and prospects
AB  - Tidal salt marshes have a high carbon accumulation rate and low CH4 emissions, representing some of the most dense carbon sinks in the world. In addition, salt marshes are likely to capture and bury atmospheric CO2 more quickly in the future due to climate warming and sea level rise. Therefore, the "blue carbon" in tidal salt marshes plays an important role in the global carbon cycle and in the mitigation of climate change. Unlike other wetland types, a salt marsh is subjected to periodic flooding and exposure by tides, which leads to the alternation of salt accumulation and leaching. Therefore, tidal flooding and the drying and wetting cycles induced by tides in a salt marsh have a profound impact on the carbon biogeochemical cycle and carbon balance. However, it is still not clear how carbon exchange and carbon sequestration in a salt marsh respond to tidal hydrodynamic processes and the drying and wetting cycles. Moreover, previous studies have generally considered the vertical exchange of CO2 or CH4 or the transverse exchange of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and particulate organic carbon (POC) in isolation to evaluate the carbon budget of tidal salt marshes, which in turn limits the accurate assessment of the carbon sequestration process. Therefore, to accurately estimate and predict the sequestration capacity of blue carbon in salt marshes, it is important to (1) analyze the effects of different stages of the tide on the key processes of carbon exchange; (2) clarify the microbial mechanism of carbon exchange in a salt marsh under tidal action; (3) explore the tidal hydrodynamic influence on the production, release, and leaching of DOC, DIC, and POC from salt marshes to the adjacent coastal water; (4) clarify the influence of tidal action on the mechanisms of carbon sequestration in a salt marsh; and (5) incorporate the tidal hydrodynamic process into the empirical models of salt marshes to accurately evaluate their carbon budget.

TI  - Microphytobenthos and phytoplankton in the Severn estuary, UK: Present situation and possible consequences of a tidal energy barrage
AB  - Information on the distribution of microphytobenthos (micro-algae forming biofilms on sediment surfaces) and phytoplankton in the Severn estuary is reviewed. Microphytobenthos (MPB) are widely distributed in salt marsh and mudflat environments, with biomass levels lower than in other estuaries (average 53 mg chl a m-2 on mud, 12 mg chl a m-2 on sand). Seasonal and spatial patterns occur in the species composition of biofilms. Large areas of the Severn have not been surveyed, but it is likely that MPB are abundant in these regions. Dissolved inorganic N, P and Si concentrations are high in the upper estuary (&gt;400 Î¼M nitrate,&gt;10 Î¼M phosphate,&gt;140 Î¼M silicate) and decrease seaward. Phytoplanktonic chl a concentrations are low in the main estuary (2.2 Î¼g chl a L-1), but increase in the Bristol Channel and at the head of the estuary (&gt;10 Î¼g chl a L-1). High turbidity is the likely cause for low phytoplankton activity. Annual production of MPB was estimated at 33 g C m-2 of inter-tidal area y-1 in the Severn estuary. This estimated benthic primary production would utilise 3.9% and 4.9% of the annual estuarine N and P loads. Construction of tidal energy barrages is estimated to significantly reduce annual estuarine MPB production (by 77% for the Cardiff-Weston barrage). It is unlikely that any potential increases in MPB biomass on remaining inter-tidal areas will be sufficient to compensate for these losses. In general, the data coverage for benthic and planktonic distribution, production and related nutrient cycles is extremely limited and significant new research work is needed to enable more definite predictions of the post-barrage situation to be made.

TI  - Blue carbon in coastal landscapes: a spatial framework for assessment of stocks and additionality
AB  - Efforts to incorporate blue carbon, the carbon associated with marine ecosystems, into carbon accounting and carbon markets are increasing. To fully leverage the capacity of marine ecosystems to sequester carbon requires information to guide prioritisation of coastal landscapes for conservation and regeneration. A comprehensive landscape-scale assessment of mangrove and saltmarsh blue carbon requires information regarding vegetation cover, sedimentological and geomorphological factors. This information should also be integrated with socio-economic factors that alter natural processes of blue carbon accumulation and storage. The purpose of this study was to provide a framework for undertaking a first-pass assessment of blue carbon storage, preservation, generation and permanency in coastal landscapes, and to incorporate socio-economic factors that will influence blue carbon storage in coastal landscapes. This was achieved using readily available datasets that were analysed using a raster-based approach to develop a proxy indication of biophysical and socio-economic factors relevant for mangrove and saltmarsh blue carbon. The approach demonstrated that large catchments were associated with areas highly suitable for blue carbon storage, preservation, generation and permanency. Small catchments associated with mature barrier estuaries had the highest proportional area that provides potential blue carbon ecosystem services and climate mitigation benefits. The qualitative approach used does not replace high-resolution quantitative assessments of blue carbon storage, flux and detailed site-specific assessment of socio-economic factors that may influence blue carbon services; however, it can be used to guide prioritisation of blue carbon landscapes for further assessment prior to conservation and/or regeneration.

TI  - Biosphere-atmosphere exchange of CO2 and CH4 in mangrove forests and salt marshes
AB  - Coastal wetlands have one of the highest carbon sequestration rates among the worldâ€™s natural ecosystems mainly because of their high primary productivity and low rate of ecosystem respiration. Meanwhile, they are often assumed to be minor sources of methane (CH4), a highly potent greenhouse gas (GHG), under the influence of high salinity. On the other hand, frequent inundation and anaerobic environment make coastal wetlands potential sources of CH4 if other favorable conditions are met. Accurate quantification of the magnitude and direction of biosphere-atmosphere exchange of GHGs, including carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4, is essential for a comprehensive assessment of the climatic impact of coastal wetlands. The eddy covariance technique allows for the direct, quasicontinuous, and long-term measurements of ecosystem-scale GHG fluxes and has been increasingly used in coastal wetland ecosystems. In this chapter, we briefly introduce the basics of the eddy covariance technique, followed by a synthesis of biosphere-atmosphere exchange of CO2 and CH4 in coastal mangroves and salt marshes, with a particular focus on the temporal variability and biophysical drivers.

TI  - Strong Dynamics in Tidal Marsh DOC Export in Response to Natural Cycles and Episodic Events From Continuous Monitoring
AB  - The role of tidal wetlands as hotspots for carbon and nutrient exchange with adjacent waters has been well documented, but large uncertainties remain regarding the physical and biogeochemical controls on these fluxes, which have significant implications for coastal carbon cycling and budgets. This study elucidates the variability in lateral wetland dissolved organic (DOC) fluxes tidally, seasonally, and during extreme weather events for a brackish wetland within a sub-estuary of the northwestern Chesapeake Bay, USA. Continuous fluxes from the wetland-draining tidal creek were calculated based on DOC concentrations ({[}DOC]) estimated using optical and physicochemical properties measured in situ with concurrent water flow data. Mean export was found to be 8.59 (+/- 1.20) kg C (n = 1,128) tidal cycle(-1) and annual flux from the wetland to sub-estuary was 200.66 (+/- 28.09) g C m(-2) yr(-1). Peaks in DOC flux were associated with Hurricane Joaquin in 2015, where just two tidal cycles accounted for similar to 5\% of annual export. Analysis of tidal creek water quality measurements reveal seasonal and tidal dependencies. Highest {[}DOC] and largest low versus high tide differences were observed in summer, corresponding to more fresh plant biomass and its mobilization, consistent with results from Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Despite summer highs in tidal creek {[}DOC], monthly DOC fluxes were greatest in early fall due to higher water flows. The annual flux presented here is higher than fluxes previously reported for this system, highlighting the importance of continuous measurements for monitoring carbon export under a wide range of environmental conditions.

TI  - Carbon Removal Using Coastal Blue Carbon Ecosystems Is Uncertain and Unreliable, With Questionable Climatic Cost-Effectiveness
AB  - Mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and tidal saltmarshes are vegetated coastal ecosystems that accumulate and store large quantities of carbon in their sediments. Many recent studies and reviews have favorably identified the potential for such coastal â€œblue carbonâ€ ecosystems to provide a natural climate solution in two ways: by conservation, reducing the greenhouse gas emissions arising from the loss and degradation of such habitats, and by restoration, to increase carbon dioxide drawdown and its long-term storage. The focus here is on the latter, assessing the feasibility of achieving quantified and secure carbon removal (negative emissions) through the restoration of coastal vegetation. Seven issues that affect the reliability of carbon accounting for this approach are considered: high variability in carbon burial rates; errors in determining carbon burial rates; lateral carbon transport; fluxes of methane and nitrous oxide; carbonate formation and dissolution; vulnerability to future climate change; and vulnerability to non-climatic factors. Information on restoration costs is also reviewed, with the conclusion that costs are highly uncertain, with lower-range estimates unrealistic for wider application. CO2 removal using coastal blue carbon restoration therefore has questionable cost-effectiveness when considered only as a climate mitigation action, either for carbon-offsetting or for inclusion in Nationally Determined Contributions. Many important issues relating to the measurement of carbon fluxes and storage have yet to be resolved, affecting certification and resulting in potential over-crediting. The restoration of coastal blue carbon ecosystems is nevertheless highly advantageous for climate adaptation, coastal protection, food provision and biodiversity conservation. Such action can therefore be societally justified in very many circumstances, based on the multiple benefits that such habitats provide at the local scale. Copyright Â© 2022 Williamson and Gattuso.

TI  - Seagrass, mangrove and saltmarsh sedimentary carbon stocks in an urban estuary; Coffs Harbour, Australia
AB  - Coastal vegetation (seagrass, mangrove and saltmarsh) termed ``blue carbon'' systems have recently been noted for their potentially large carbon storage capacities. This study quantifies sedimentary blue carbon stocks in an urban estuary containing seagrass (Zostera muelleri), mangrove (Avicennia marina), and saltmarsh (Sporobolus virginicus) habitats in the Coffs Creek Estuary (NSW, Australia). The objective of this study is to investigate the carbon storage dynamics, including the evaluation of potential influences from the plant cover and geomorphology. The sediment carbon stock results presented in this work show that mangroves store more carbon, 1070 +/- 827 compared to 858 +/- 190 and 365 +/- 255 Mg ha(-1) than saltmarsh and seagrass, respectively. These results are of interest because in Coffs Creek alone, mangroves have expanded (in area) by more than 25\% from 1986 to 2011. The large sediment carbon stocks found in this urban system emphasize the benefits of restoring and protecting these ecosystems as a way of offsetting atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

TI  - Effects of waterlogging and salinity increase on CO2 efflux in soil from coastal marshes
AB  - Coastal marshes play a notable role in sequestering carbon in plants and soil; however, coastal ecosystems are vulnerable to global change in terms of sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion. The effects of independent and interactive hydrological treatments of waterlogging and elevated salinity on soil CO2 effluxes in Spartina alterniflora marshes were investigated based on a mesocosm approach. This study highlighted the importance of respective soil respirations during inundation (nondrainage, Rs.ND) and reaeration (drainage, Rs.D) in the marshes soils. We found that waterlogging treatments heavily suppressed Rs.ND but increased the Rs.D, regardless of salinity levels. Light salinity enhanced soil respiration, whereas high salinity inhibited soil CO2 efflux, regardless of the water table level. Waterlogging strengthened the negative effects of salinity on Rs.ND and offset the negative effects on Rs.D. The variations in soil respiration under the hydrological treatments can be mainly attributed to changes in root biomass; indigenous soil microbial biomass; and activities of sucrase, cellulase and dehydrogenase, as well as ionic concentrations and oxidation-reduction potential. The temperature sensitivity (Q10 value) of soil respiration (only for Rs.D) after drainage showed a notable decline under the conditions of waterlogging and high salinity. The effect degree of coupled hydrological treatments on soil respiration and Q10 values was similar to a single waterlogging factor before drainage and more strongly than a single factor after drainage. We suggest that the soil CO2 efflux under water flooding and reaeration, inundation duration, and salinity levels need to be considered to understand the impacts of future hydrological changes on coastal marshes.

TI  - Controls on Sediment Accretion and Blue Carbon Burial in Tidal Saline Wetlands: Insights From the Oregon Coast, USA
AB  - Oregon estuaries provide important opportunities to assess controls on tidal saline wetland carbon burial and sediment accretion as both rates of relative sea level rise (RSLR; -1.4 0.9 to 2.8 0.8 mm yr(-1)) and fluvial suspended sediment load relative to estuary area (0.23 to 17 x 10(3) t km(-2) yr(-1)) vary along the coast. We hypothesized that vertical accretion, measured using excess Pb-210 in least-disturbed wetlands within seven Oregon estuaries, would vary with either RSLR or sediment load relative to estuary area, and carbon burial would correlate strongly to sediment accretion. Mean rates of high marsh accretion (0.8 0.2 to 4.1 0.2 mm yr(-1)) indicate that Oregon tidal wetlands have mainly kept pace with twentieth-century RSLR with the exception that the accretionary balance in the central coast is negative, suggesting drowning. Experiencing the fastest rates of RSLR, central-coast estuaries may foreshadow the fates of other Oregon estuaries under future accelerated sea level rise. Comparison of mass accumulation rates with sediment loads, however, indicates low trapping efficiency and therefore no fluvial sediment limitation. Thus, nonlinear feedback between RSLR and sediment accretion may enhance wetland resistance to drowning. Among wetlands keeping pace with or exceeding RSLR, sediment accretion displays no significant relationship with elevation but rather appears controlled by both the rate of RSLR and relative sediment load, highlighting the importance of incorporating both factors into future studies of tidal saline wetlands. Carbon burial rates, controlled by sediment accretion, will likely increase with future accelerated sea level rise. Plain Language Summary Salt marshes and brackish scrub-shrub and forested tidal wetlands, collectively known as tidal saline wetlands, provide valuable services such as habitat for wildlife, protection from coastal flooding, and carbon sequestration. Despite their importance, tidal saline wetlands are threatened by sea level rise and scientists must better understand what controls their growth so as to make predictions of their future survival. Additionally, sediment accumulation within tidal saline wetlands is an important control on the amount of carbon sequestered in coastal areas; thus, understanding how these systems will evolve in the coming decades may shed light on the global carbon cycle and climate change. New results from the Oregon coast indicate that both the local pace of sea level rise and the amount of sediment delivered by rivers control tidal saline wetland growth. Because sea level rise is relatively slow in Oregon and Pacific Northwest rivers deliver relatively high amounts of sediment to the coast, Oregon tidal saline wetlands may be resistant to future drowning. However, of the seven estuaries studied, two showed evidence of drowning over the last century; the reasons for this are unclear but may relate to the local pace of sea level rise or other processes not accounted for in this study. Key Points Oregon tidal saline wetlands kept pace with twentieth-century sea level rise, except in the central coast, the reasons for which are unclear In estuaries with a positive accretionary balance, both sea level rise and sediment load relative to estuary area control accretion Blue carbon burial rates, provided herein, are the first such measurements for Oregon tidal saline wetlands

TI  - The value of carbon sequestration by saltmarsh in Chichester Harbour, United Kingdom
AB  - Following decades of habitat loss, carbon sequestration by coastal margin habitats has been recognised for its capacity to regulate atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Chichester Harbour, an estuarine complex on the South coast of the UK, is used as a case study area in this paper. Saltmarsh habitat there has declined by 60.6\% from 1946 to 2018. This downward trend is predicted to continue. Extrapolated from historic habitat loss, three future saltmarsh habitat area scenarios (worst-case, average loss, best-case) are used to estimate the net carbon sequestered by saltmarsh from 2018 to 2030. Only the best-case scenario predicts a positive net carbon sequestration. Two representative carbon prices (UK policy abatement cost, and the social cost of carbon) are applied to estimate the value of the net carbon sequestered. Discount rates of 2.3\% and 3.5\% are also applied. Average loss scenario values range from -2,221,358.99 pound +/- 627,655.96 (abatement cost and a 2.3\% discount rate) to -986,303.19 pound +/- 278,684.84 (social cost of carbon and a 3.5\% discount rate). This study is the first to examine non-use values in the area. Results generated here can aid in highlighting the benefits saltmarsh habitats provide, promoting its conservation, as valuations of coastal habitats are poorly represented in management.

TI  - Ecosystem engineering by large grazers enhances carbon stocks in a tidal salt marsh
AB  - Grazers can have a large impact on ecosystem processes and are known to change vegetation composition. However, knowledge of how the long-term presence of grazers affects soil carbon sequestration is limited. In this study, we estimated total accumulated organic carbon in soils of a back-barrier salt marsh and determined how this is affected by long-term grazing by both small and large grazers in relation to age of the ecosystem. In young marshes, where small grazers predominate, hare and geese have a limited effect on total accumulated organic carbon. In older, mature marshes, where large grazers predominate, cattle substantially enhanced carbon content in the marsh soil. We ascribe this to a shift in biomass distribution in the local vegetation towards the roots in combination with trampling effects on the soil chemistry. These large grazers thus act as ecosystem engineers: their known effect on soil compaction (based on a previous study) enhances anoxic conditions in the marsh soil, thereby reducing the oxygen available for organic carbon decomposition by the local microbial community. This study showed that the indirect effects of grazing can significantly enhance soil carbon storage through changing soil abiotic conditions. This process should be taken into account when estimating the role of ecosystems in reducing carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Ultimately, we propose a testable conceptual framework that includes 3 pathways by which grazers can alter carbon storage: (1) through above-ground biomass removal, (2) through alteration of biomass distribution towards the roots and/or (3) by changing soil abiotic conditions that affect decomposition.

TI  - Carbon storage versus fossil fuel substitution: a climate change mitigation option for two different land use categories based on short and long rotation forestry in India
AB  - Short rotation bioenergy crops for energy production are considered an effective means to mitigate the greenhouse effect, mainly due to their ability to substitute fossil fuels. Alternatively, carbon can be sequestered and stored in the living biomass. This paper compares the two land use categories (forest land and non-forest land) for two management practices (short rotation vs. long rotation) to study mitigation potential of afforestation and fossil fuel substitution as compared to carbon storage. Significant carbon benefit can be obtained in the long run from using lands for growing short rotation energy crops and substituting fossil fuels by the biomass thus produced, as opposed to sequestering carbon in the biomass of the trees. When growth rates are high and harvest is used in a sustainable manner (i.e., replanting after every harvest), the opportunities for net carbon reductions appear to be fossil fuel substitution, rather than storage in ecosystem biomass. Our results suggest that at year 100 a total of 216 Mg C ha(-1) is sequestered for afforestation/reforestation using long rotation sal (Shorea robusta Gaertn.f) species, as opposed to offset of 412 Mg C ha(-1) for carbon storage and fossil fuel substitution for short rotation poplar (Populus Deltoides Marsh) plantations. The bioenergy option results in a continuous stream of about 3 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) of carbon benefits per year on forest land and 4 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) on non-forest land. Earlier studies have shown that in India waste land availability for establishing energy plantations is in the range of 9.6 to 36.5 Mha. Thus, using the 758 Tg biomass per year generated from 9.6 Mha waste land gives a mitigation potential in the range of 227 to 303 Tg C per year for carbon storage and fossil fuel substitution from poplar plantation for substituting coal based power generation. Depending upon the land availability for plantation, the potential for energy generation is in the range of 11,370 PJ, possibly amounting to a bioenergy supply of 43\% of the total projected energy consumption in 2015. Further studies are needed to estimate the mitigation potential of other species with different productivities for overall estimation of the economic feasibility and social acceptability in a tropical country like India.

TI  - Vegetation succession and carbon sequestration in a coastal wetland in northwest Florida: Evidence from carbon isotopes
AB  - Measurements of stable carbon isotopic ratios as well as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) contents in soils and plants were made along a chronovegetation sequence stretching from high marsh to low marsh in a coastal wetland in northwest Florida. The wetland is dominated by Juncus roemerianus, which is a C3 plant and has an average delta C-13 of -27 parts per thousand. Lesser amounts of other species, including C4 plants, are also present in the area. The delta C-13 values of soil organic matter from low and middle marshes range from -24 to -27 parts per thousand, which are consistent with the current plant community. However, the delta C-13 values of soil organic matter from high marsh show significant variations, from -23 parts per thousand in the surface soil to -17 parts per thousand at depth. This large C isotopic variation within soil profiles indicates a shift in local vegetation, from a C4-dominated community to the current C3 plant-dominated marsh, as a result of landward expansion of the wetland due to sea level rise. Radiocarbon dates on soil organic matter indicate that this ecological change occurred in the past hundred years or so as a result of sea level rise presumably due to global warming. Soil organic carbon inventory was similar to 29 +/- 3.6 kg m(-2) in low marsh (the oldest part of the wetland), 15 +/- 3.6 kg m(-2) in middle marsh, and 13 +/- 6.0 kg m(-2) in high marsh (the youngest and most inland part of the wetland). N and P inventories are also higher in low marsh than in high marsh and seem to correlate directly with aboveground productivity in the marshes. The much higher C storage in low marsh than in high marsh indicates that carbon sequestration increased significantly as coastal wetland evolves from high marsh (initial stage) to low marsh (steady state). This has important implications to the global C cycle. As sea level rises owing to global warming, coastal wetlands are expected to expand landward in many areas where topography is gentle, which would provide a significant sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide.

TI  - Tidal influence on the relationship between solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and canopy photosynthesis in a coastal salt marsh
AB  - Accurately estimating the dynamics of ecosystem photosynthesis in coastal wetlands is of paramount importance to the quantification of blue carbon and climate change. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence at 760 nm (SIF760) and the gross primary productivity (GPP), as well as the underlying mechanisms in coastal salt marshes that are regularly flooded by tides, based on continuous observations of the SIF760 and GPP throughout the growing season of Phragmites australis during 2019. The results show that the SIF760 was significantly correlated with the GPP on the half-hourly, daily, and weekly scales in different phenological stages, and the linearity of the SIF760-GPP relationship generally improved as the time scale increased. Moreover, we found that the canopy structure (i.e., leaf area index and spatial distribution of leaf angles) plays a major role in explaining the relationship between the SIF760 and photosynthesis on half-hourly and daily scales at the study site. Tidal flooding significantly suppressed the strength of the correlation between SIF760 and GPP in the early and rapid growth vegetation stage. Furthermore, the tides generally lowered the degree of the correlation between the light use efficiency for photosynthesis (LUEp) and the SIF yield, and between the LUEp and the canopy SIF760 escape probability. This indicates that tidal inundation diminished the roles of the plant physiology and canopy structure in explaining the relationship between the SIF760 and photosynthesis, and thus, it had a negative effect on the SIF760-based GPP estimation. The results of this study demonstrate that tidal inundation exerts a significant influence on the relationships between the SIF760 and GPP and their responses to the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, which leads to a better understanding of the mechanism linking the SIF760 and photosynthesis in tidal wetlands and provides new insights into reliable blue carbon quantification in a large scale domain.

TI  - Response of a salt marsh plant to sediment deposition disturbance
AB  - Salt marshes (a type of coastal wetland with herbaceous plants) are one of the most productive ecosystems. The organic matter accumulated by plants, together with deposition of inorganic mineral sediments, contributes to vertical marsh growth and determines the marsh ability to cope with regional sea level rise. Deposition of mineral sediment, in turn, alters the growth of plant roots and shoots, and further marsh morphology and blue carbon storage. Based on mesocosm experiments simulating the sedimentation intensity, this paper examined the responses of Spartina alterniflora (a plant widely distributed in global salt marshes) to sediment deposition events (0-24 cm thicknesses). The plant height increased by 1.51 cm on average with 1 cm sediment deposition. New roots grew into the deposited sediment layers, resulting in a significant increase in the below-ground biomass. The below-ground biomass doubled with the treatment of 24 cm deposition thickness in comparison with that without deposition. The depth-dependent distribution of below-ground biomass changed from a monotonous (decreasing with soil depth) to a non-monotonic (increasing first and then decreasing) trend. This illustrates the growth of marsh plants in response to sediment deposition disturbance (similar to artificial or storm-induced sediment deposition) and have important implications for further investigations on marsh resiliency, blue carbon storage and marsh morphology.

TI  - Climate and plant controls on soil organic matter in coastal wetlands
AB  - Coastal wetlands are among the most productive and carbon-rich ecosystems on Earth. Long-term carbon storage in coastal wetlands occurs primarily belowground as soil organic matter (SOM). In addition to serving as a carbon sink, SOM influences wetland ecosystem structure, function, and stability. To anticipate and mitigate the effects of climate change, there is a need to advance understanding of environmental controls on wetland SOM. Here, we investigated the influence of four soil formation factors: climate, biota, parent materials, and topography. Along the northern Gulf of Mexico, we collected wetland plant and soil data across elevation and zonation gradients within 10 estuaries that span broad temperature and precipitation gradients. Our results highlight the importance of climate-plant controls and indicate that the influence of elevation is scale and location dependent. Coastal wetland plants are sensitive to climate change; small changes in temperature or precipitation can transform coastal wetland plant communities. Across the region, SOM was greatest in mangrove forests and in salt marshes dominated by graminoid plants. SOM was lower in salt flats that lacked vascular plants and in salt marshes dominated by succulent plants. We quantified strong relationships between precipitation, salinity, plant productivity, and SOM. Low precipitation leads to high salinity, which limits plant productivity and appears to constrain SOM accumulation. Our analyses use data from the Gulf of Mexico, but our results can be related to coastal wetlands across the globe and provide a foundation for predicting the ecological effects of future reductions in precipitation and freshwater availability. Coastal wetlands provide many ecosystem services that are SOM dependent and highly vulnerable to climate change. Collectively, our results indicate that future changes in SOM and plant productivity, regulated by cascading effects of precipitation on freshwater availability and salinity, could impact wetland stability and affect the supply of some wetland ecosystem services.

TI  - Effect of burrowing crabs on retention and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen in an intertidal salt marsh
AB  - Ecosystem engineers that affect other organisms by creating, modifying, maintaining or destroying habitats have received widespread attention. Understanding natural ecosystems and the way in which ecosystem engineers shape the environment is important to ecological restoration based on key ecosystem processes. Increasing studies has shown that crabs in intertidal salt marsh can act as ecosystem engineers, affecting the geomorphological processes and spatial heterogeneity of tidal flat. In this study, field investigations and manipulative experiments were conducted to explore how crab burrowing activity affects intertidal microtopography and soil carbon and nitrogen in the intertidal salt marshes. The results showed that crab burrowing activity is one of the key factors influencing concave-convex microtopography, which could intercept plant detritus and subsequently influencing the retention and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen. When compared to areas of flat microtopography with few or no crab burrows, soil organic carbon content (SOC), soil inorganic carbon content (SIC), total carbon content (TC), and total nitrogen content (TN) in adjacent areas of concave-convex micro topography with high density crab burrows were all significantly higher. Artificial simulation of ecosystem engineering processes could also change the geomorphological features of tidal flats and improve the retention and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen, which could also attract more crabs to burrow and settle down, then generate and maintain the concave-convex microtopography. Taken together, the results of this study provide scientific and effective implication and guidance for the restoration of coastal salt marshes.

TI  - Refining Estimates of Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Salt Marsh â€œBlue Carbonâ€ Erosion and Decomposition
AB  - Coastal wetlands have sediments that contain organic matter preserved against decomposition for timespans that can range up to millennia. This â€œblue carbonâ€ in wetland sediments has been proposed as a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide and a potential source of greenhouse gases if coastal habitats are lost. A missing gap in the role of coastal habitats in the global carbon cycle is elucidating the fate of wetland sediment carbon following disturbance events, such as erosion, that can liberate organic matter to an oxygenated environment where decomposition can more readily occur. Here, we track the fate of previously stored salt marsh sediment by measuring the production of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) during an oxygenated incubation. Sediments from two depth horizons (5â€“10 cm and 20â€“25 cm) were incubated at two temperatures (20 and 30Â°C) for 161 days. Q10 of the decomposition process over the entire course of the experiment was 2.0 Â± 0.1 and 2.2 Â± 0.2 for shallow and deep horizons, respectively. Activation energy for the decomposition reaction (49.7 kJ â‹… molâ€“1 and 58.8 kJ â‹… molâ€“1 for shallow and deep sediment horizons, respectively) was used to calculate temperature-specific decomposition rates that could be applied to environmental data. Using high-frequency water temperature data, this strategy was applied to coastal states in the conterminous United States (CONUS) where we estimated annual in situ decomposition of eroded salt marsh organic matter as 7â€“24% loss per year. We estimate 62.90 Â± 2.81 Gg C â‹… yrâ€“1 is emitted from eroded salt marsh sediment decomposition in the CONUS. Â© Copyright Â© 2021 McTigue, Walker and Currin.

TI  - Invasive cordgrass (Spartina spp.) in south-eastern Australia induces island formation, salt marsh development, and carbon storage
AB  - Invasive vegetation species can lead to major changes in the geomorphology of coastal systems. Within temperate estuaries in the southern hemisphere, especially Australia and New Zealand, the cordgrass Spartina spp. has become established. These species are highly invasive, and their prolific growth leads to the development of supratidal environments in formerly intertidal and subtidal environments. Here, we quantified the impact of Spartina invasion on the geomorphology and sequestration capacity of carbon in the sediments of Anderson Inlet, Victoria, Australia. Spartina was first introduced to the area in the 1930s to aid in land reclamation and control coastal erosion associated with coastal development. We found that Spartina now dominates the intertidal areas of the Inlet and promotes accretion (18mm/year) causing the formation of over 108ha of supratidal islands over the past 100years. These newly formed islands are calculated to potentially contain over 5.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent carbon. Future management of the inlet and other Spartina-dominated environments within Australian presents a dilemma for resource managers; on the one hand, Spartina is highly invasive and can outcompete native tidal marshes, thereby warranting its eradication, but on the other hand it is likely more resilient to rising sea levels and has the potential for carbon sequestration. Whether or not the potential advantages outweigh the significant habitat change that is anticipated, any management strategies will likely require additional research into costs and benefits of all ecosystem services provided by Spartina including in relation to nutrient cycling, shoreline stabilisation, and biodiversity as well as in response to the longevity of carbon found within the sediments.

TI  - Temperature sensitivity of organic-matter decay in tidal marshes
AB  - Approximately half of marine carbon sequestration takes place in coastal wetlands, including tidal marshes, where organic matter contributes to soil elevation and ecosystem persistence in the face of sea-level rise. The long-term viability of marshes and their carbon pools depends, in part, on how the balance between productivity and decay responds to climate change. Here, we report the sensitivity of labile soil organic-matter decay in tidal marshes to seasonal and latitudinal variations in temperature measured over a 3-year period. We find a moderate increase in decay rate at warmer temperatures (3-6\% per degrees C, Q(10) = 1.3-1.5). Despite the profound differences between microbial metabolism in wetlands and uplands, our results indicate a strong conservation of temperature sensitivity. Moreover, simple comparisons with organic-matter production suggest that elevated atmospheric CO2 and warmer temperatures will accelerate carbon accumulation in marsh soils, and potentially enhance their ability to survive sea-level rise.

TI  - New Insights Into the Influence of Plant and Microbial Diversity on Denitrification Rates in a Salt Marsh
AB  - Coastal salt marshes are some of the most productive ecosystems on Earth, providing numerous services such as soil carbon storage, flood protection and nutrient filtering, several of which are mediated by the sediment microbiome associated with marsh vegetation. Here, nutrient filtering (nitrate removal through denitrification) was examined by determining microbial (bacteria and archaea) community structure (16S rRNA gene iTag sequencing), diversity, denitrification rates and metabolic potential (assembled metagenomic sequences) in collocated patches of Spartina alterniflora (Spartina) and Juncus roemerianus (Juncus) sediments. The iTag data showed that diversity and richness in Spartina and Juncus sediment microbial communities were highly similar. However, microbial community evenness differed significantly, with the most even communities observed in Juncus sediments. Further, denitrification rates were significantly higher in Juncus compared to Spartina, suggesting oscillations in microbial abundances and in particular the core microbiome identified herein, along with plant diversity influence marsh nitrogen (N) removal. Amplicon and assembled metagenome sequences pointed to a potentially important, yet unappreciated Planctomycetes role in N removal in the salt marsh. Thus, ecosystem perturbations that alter marsh vegetation distribution could impact microbial diversity and may ultimately influence the ecologically important ecosystem functions the marsh sediment microbiome provides.

TI  - Extraction of seagrass biophysical parameters using unmanned aerial systems (UAS)
AB  - Carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere is drastically increasing every year because of continuous development of industrial activities of today's society. An active research regarding carbon sequestration and carbon storage is progressing, demanding for more investigation and analysis of carbon sinks. Recent studies found out that coastal wetlands - mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrass, are far more capable of carbon sequestration and carbon storage than terrestrial ecosystems. Approximately 15% of total carbon storage in the ocean are sequestered by seagrasses, although seagrasses inhabit only 0.2% of the area of the oceans. To estimate the carbon sequestered by seagrasses, extent, percent cover and density are among the biophysical parameters necessary. In this study, the RGB aerial images using Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) was utilized for classification of seagrass and extraction of seagrass density and percent cover. UAS survey was conducted in Anda, Pangasinan to gather RGB images and field samples were also collected. The images were mosaicked to produce an orthophoto. To classify seagrass from non-seagrass areas, object-based classification (OBC) and pixel-based classification (PBC) were used and compared by implementing the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Maximum Likelihood method. Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering was performed for the derivation of the percent cover and density. Results showed that OBC having an overall accuracy of 93% produced higher accuracy than PBC which yields 86%. Meanwhile, most seagrass areas were categorized with dense and continuous density. The study proved that Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) was an effective approach for seagrass cover mapping because it produces high-resolution images resulting to more accurate maps.

TI  - Effects of Drying-Rewetting Frequency on Vertical and Lateral Loss of Soil Organic Carbon in a Tidal Salt Marsh
AB  - Tidal salt marshes, as ``blue carbon{''} ecosystems, play a critical role in mitigation of global climate change since their large soil organic carbon (SOC) pool. Drying-rewetting cycles induced by periodic tides have profound influence on soil carbon cycling in tidal salt marshes. However, the magnitude and mechaanism of the effects of drying-rewetting frequency on SOC loss in tidal salt marshes is still uncertain. Here, we conducted a mesocosm experiment to identify how drying-rewetting frequency changes alter the vertical (CO2 and CH4) and lateral (dissolved organic carbon) carbon losses of soils in a tidal salt marsh in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). We found that increasing soil moisture inhibited CO2 emission but stimulated CH4 emission in a tidal salt marsh. Soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was produced in the drying phase and rewetting lead to the loss of DOC. Soil moisture and salinity change induced by drying-rewetting cycles were the critical factors controlling vertical organic carbon loss in a tidal salt marsh. DOC had significant effects on CO2 emissions. Changes of tidal action and drying-rewetting cycle induced by global change can affect the pathway of carbon loss in a tidal salt marsh.

TI  - Predators help protect carbon stocks in blue carbon ecosystems
AB  - Predators continue to be harvested unsustainably throughout most of the Earth's ecosystems. Recent research demonstrates that the functional loss of predators could have far-reaching consequences on carbon cycling and, by implication, our ability to ameliorate climate change impacts. Yet the influence of predators on carbon accumulation and preservation in vegetated coastal habitats (that is, salt marshes, seagrass meadows and mangroves) is poorly understood, despite these being some of the Earth's most vulnerable and carbon-rich ecosystems. Here we discuss potential pathways by which trophic downgrading affects carbon capture, accumulation and preservation in vegetated coastal habitats. We identify an urgent need for further research on the influence of predators on carbon cycling in vegetated coastal habitats, and ultimately the role that these systems play in climate change mitigation. There is, however, sufficient evidence to suggest that intact predator populations are critical to maintaining or growing reserves of `blue carbon' (carbon stored in coastal or marine ecosystems), and policy and management need to be improved to reflect these realities.

TI  - Prediction of the landscape pattern of the Yancheng Coastal Wetland, China, based on XGBoost and the MCE-CA-Markov model
AB  - Coastal wetland is a crucial part of the blue carbon ecosystem, having unique structural characteristics and serving both land and water functions. These areas also offer strong carbon sequestration and storage capacity. However, human activities and climate change have led to an ongoing decline in wetland areas. As an important wetland reserve in China, the coastal wetlands of Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, bring together a great number of water resources, land resources, biological resources, landscape resources, mineral resources, energy resources, and many other resources. However, in recent years, the coastal wetlands of Yancheng have also faced a continuous reduction in area. In this study, an integrated model of the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm and multi-criteria evaluation-cellular automata-Markov (MCE-CA-Markov) model was designed to determine the importance of the driving factors of landscape pattern change and predict the landscape pattern of coastal wetlands in 2025, based on the analysis of landscape pattern changes in 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 in Yancheng coastal wetlands, Jiangsu Province. The results showed that the landscape configuration of coastal wetlands in Yancheng changed significantly during 2005â€“2020. The total natural wetland landscape area declined steadily over that 15-year span, showing a total decrease of 2.971Ã—104 ha; on the contrary, the artificial wetlands increased. The analysis of the driving factors of wetland damage showed that gross domestic product (GDP), distance to roads, and average precipitation were the key factors. Based on this model, the natural wetland landscape of Yancheng's coastal wetlands is predicted to decline sharply in 2025, and the wetland salt marsh vegetation will be extensively converted to aquaculture and agricultural land. Constructed land is predicted to increase significantly, and the trend of urban expansion is obvious. The study concludes with practical suggestions for the sustainable development and ecological conservation of the Yancheng coastal wetland ecosystem based on the predicted scenario.

TI  - Intertidal salt marshes as an important source of inorganic carbon to the coastal ocean
AB  - Dynamic tidal export of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to the coastal ocean from highly productive intertidal marshes and its effects on seawater carbonate chemistry are thoroughly evaluated. The study uses a comprehensive approach by combining tidal water sampling of CO2 parameters across seasons, continuous in situ measurements of biogeochemically-relevant parameters and water fluxes, with high-resolution modeling in an intertidal salt marsh of the U.S. northeast region. Salt marshes can acidify and alkalize tidal water by injecting CO2 (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA). DIC and TA generation may also be decoupled due to differential effects of marsh aerobic and anaerobic respiration on DIC and TA. As marsh DIC is added to tidal water, the buffering capacity first decreases to a minimum and then increases quickly. Large additions of marsh DIC can result in higher buffering capacity in ebbing tide than incoming tide. Alkalization of tidal water, which mostly occurs in the summer due to anaerobic respiration, can further modify buffering capacity. Marsh exports of DIC and alkalinity may have complex implications for the future, more acidified ocean. Marsh DIC export exhibits high variability over tidal and seasonal cycles, which is modulated by both marsh DIC generation and by water fluxes. The marsh DIC export of 414 g C m(-2) yr(-1), based on high-resolution measurements and modeling, is more than twice the previous estimates. It is a major term in the marsh carbon budget and translates to one of the largest carbon fluxes along the U.S. East Coast.

TI  - Distribution of iron- and sulfate-reducing bacteria across a coastal acid sulfate soil (CASS) environment: Implications for passive bioremediation by tidal inundation
AB  - Coastal acid sulfate soils (CASS) constitute a serious and global environmental problem. Oxidation of iron sulfide minerals exposed to air generates sulfuric acid with consequently negative impacts on coastal and estuarine ecosystems. Tidal inundation represents one current treatment strategy for CASS, with the aim of neutralizing acidity by triggering microbial iron- and sulfate-reduction and inducing the precipitation of iron-sulfides. Although well-known functional guilds of bacteria drive these processes, their distributions within CASS environments, as well as their relationships to tidal cycling and the availability of nutrients and electron acceptors, are poorly understood. These factors will determine the long-term efficacy of "passive" CASS remediation strategies. Here we studied microbial community structure and functional guild distribution in sediment cores obtained from 10 depths ranging from 0 to 20 cm in three sites located in the supra-, inter- and sub-tidal segments, respectively, of a CASS-affected salt marsh (East Trinity, Cairns, Australia). Whole community 16S rRNA gene diversity within each site was assessed by 454 pyrotag sequencing and bioinformatic analyses in the context of local hydrological, geochemical, and lithological factors. The results illustrate spatial overlap, or close association, of iron-, and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in an environment rich in organic matter and controlled by parameters such as acidity, redox potential, degree of water saturation, and mineralization. The observed spatial distribution implies the need for empirical understanding of the timing, relative to tidal cycling, of various terminal electron-accepting processes that control acid generation and biogeochemical iron and sulfur cycling.

TI  - Observations of Wave Height Amplification Behind an Oyster Castle Breakwater System in a High-Energy Environment: Gandys Beach, NJ
AB  - This study reports findings of an analysis of modifications to the incident wave field caused by constructed Oyster Castle (R) breakwater systems at Gandys Beach Preserve in Downe Township, NJ. The Nature Conservancy's (TNC) Gandys Beach Preserve is a one-mile stretch of beach located along with intertidal mud flats, sandy beaches, tidal creeks, and salt marshes. Gandys Beach can be classified as a high-energy environment, with open water fetches exceeding 30 miles, and a tidal range on the order of 2 m. The Gandys Beach living shoreline project was designed and constructed by TNC in partnership with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to investigate the effectiveness of various natural and nature-based features (NNBFs) in protecting and enhancing salt marshes and beaches in high (er) energy environments. Many of the NNBF techniques used at Gandys Beach, such as Oyster Castle (R) block breakwaters (Oyster Castles), had only been implemented at smaller scales in New Jersey prior to the project. Stevens was contracted by USFWS/TNC to evaluate the impact of the breakwater systems on incident waves. Four breakwater sections along the beach were selected to monitor wave attenuation. Month-long deployments of wave staffs and pressure sensors occurred in the summer and winter of 2019. Analysis of the data indicates that when crests of the Oyster Castles are exposed the breakwater system effectively attenuates waves. However, when the structures are submerged, wave height attenuation decreases, and under certain conditions wave heights behind Oyster Castles can be amplified more than 80\%. These results are troubling, especially in areas experiencing sea level rise where the frequency of submergence will likely increase in the future. Due to the complex nature of Gandys Beach, exact mechanisms causing this amplification remain uncertain. Furthermore, transmission coefficients (K-t) above 1 are not typically modeled in existing empirical equations. Seabrook and Hall (Coast. Eng. Proc., 1998, 1 (26), 2000) is the only studied empirical formula that indicated an amplification of the H-s as observed during these field deployments and therefore was used to model K-t. However, poor agreement between the modeled and observed K-t was found and a better predictive tool is needed.

TI  - Effect of restoration on saltmarsh carbon accumulation in Eastern England
AB  - Wetland soils are globally important carbon stores, and natural wetlands provide a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) through ongoing carbon accumulation. Recognition of coastal wetlands as a significant contributor to carbon storage (blue carbon) has generated interest into the climate change mitigation benefits of restoring or recreating saltmarsh habitat. However, the length of time a re-created marsh will take to become functionally equivalent to a natural (reference) system, or indeed, whether reference conditions are attainable, is largely unknown. Here, we describe a combined field chronosequence and modelling study of saltmarsh carbon accumulation and provide empirically based predictions of changes in the carbon sequestration rate over time following saltmarsh restoration. Carbon accumulation was initially rapid (average 1.04 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) during the first 20 years), slowing to a steady rate of around 0.65 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) thereafter. The resulting increase in C stock gave an estimated total C accumulation of 74 t C ha(-1) in the century following restoration. This is approximately the same as our observations of natural marsh C content (69 t C ha(-1)), suggesting that it takes approximately 100 years for restored saltmarsh to obtain the same carbon stock as natural sites.

TI  - Does Regional Development Influence Sedimentary Blue Carbon Stocks? A Case Study From Three Australian Estuaries
AB  - Mitigating climate change through the reduction of atmospheric CO2 levels is of interest, particularly through maintaining and re-establishing natural ecosystems that act as carbon sinks, such as coastal vegetated habitats or ``blue carbon{''} systems. Here we compare sedimentary blue carbon (C) stocks from 37 sediment cores collected in pristine (n = 13), agricultural (n = 11), and urban (n = 13) estuaries within the same geomorphological region, located on the eastern coast of Australia. The mean estimated C stocks for each carbon system (seagrass, mangrove, and saltmarshes) were 402 +/- 78, 830 +/- 109, and 723 +/- 100 Mg C ha(-1), respectively, conservatively estimated up to 3 m depths. Analysis of variance revealed no significant difference between C stocks per area (C ha(-1)) considering each habitat type and between specific estuaries. However, the total estuarine C stocks were found to be greater with increasing levels of conservation, based on larger areas of blue carbon vegetation. The potential loss of C to the atmosphere from these small regional estuaries are 500,574 +/- 118,635 tons of CO2 equivalent (CO(2)e), based on specific assumptions. The implication of these results are that there are large C stocks in small regional estuaries which supports the protection of blue C systems in developing coastal areas and highlights the uncertainties of the CO2 emissions from potential blue C habitat degradation.

TI  - Carbon Pool in Mexican Wetland Soils: Importance of the Environmental Service
AB  - Mexican wetlands are not included in Earth system models around the world, despite being an important carbon store in the wetland soils in the tropics. In this review, five different types of wetlands were observed (marshes, swamps, flooded grasslands, flooded palms and mangroves) in which their carbon pool/carbon sequestrations in Mexican zones were studied. In addition, it was shown that swamps (forested freshwater wetlands) sequestered more carbon in the soil (86.17 +/- 35.9 Kg C m(-2)) than other types of wetlands (p = 0.011); however, these ecosystems are not taken into consideration by the Mexican laws on protection compared with mangroves (34.1 +/- 5.2 Kg C m(-2)). The carbon pool detected for mangrove was statistically similar (p > 0.05) to data of carbon observed in marshes (34.1 +/- 5.2 Kg C m(-2)) and flooded grassland (28.57 +/- 1.04 Kg C m(-2)) ecosystems. The value of carbon in flooded palms (8.0 +/- 4.2 Kg C m(-2)) was lower compared to the other wetland types, but no significant differences were found compared with flooded grasslands (p = 0.99). Thus, the carbon deposits detected in the different wetland types should be taken into account by policy makers and agents of change when making laws for environmental protection, as systematic data on carbon dynamics in tropical wetlands is needed in order to allow their incorporation into global carbon budgets.

TI  - Coastal carbon processing rates increase with mangrove cover following a hurricane in Texas, USA
AB  - Changes in species distributions and disturbances have complex impacts on ecosystem functioning. In many subtropical coastal wetlands, plant identity and cover are changing, as salt marshes dominated by low-stature herbaceous species transition to woody mangroves. These systems are also subject to frequent and potentially more intense hurricanes, which can alter a range of ecosystem structures and functions. We examined how changes in dominant plant species affected carbon processing in coastal wetlands following a hurricane. We experimentally manipulated cell-scale (3 x 3 m) cover of black mangroves (Avicennia germinans) and salt marsh plants (e.g., Spartina alterniflora and Batis maritima) in fringe and interior locations of 10 plots (24 x 42 m) to create a gradient in mangrove cover in coastal Texas, USA. Hurricane Harvey made direct landfall over our site on 25 August 2017, uniformly decreasing soil nutrients and impacting the spatial patterns of total soil sulfide accumulation (delta S-34). To test how mangrove cover affected carbon processing and retention after the hurricane, we measured litter breakdown rates (k) of A. germinans and S. alterniflora in surface soils and associated microbial respiration rates, and fast- and slow-decomposing standard litter substrates (green and red tea, respectively) in subsurface soils (15 cm depth). Soil temperatures were lower in mangrove than marsh cells, and A. germinans litter k increased linearly with plot-level mangrove cover. Breakdown rates of S. alterniflora and fast-decomposing green tea litter increased nonlinearly with mangrove cover (highest k at intermediate \% cover). Slow-decomposing red tea had similar k in all plots and was highest where soil delta S-34 was greatest. Microbial respiration rates (R) did not change with plot-level mangrove cover for either S. alterniflora or A. germinans litter. Respiration associated with S. alterniflora litter was highest in interior marsh cells, and R associated with A. germinans litter was similar between fringe and interior mangrove cells. Despite widespread declines in soil nutrient concentrations and increases in delta S-34, all predicted to decrease R and k, post-hurricane carbon processing increased with mangrove cover in coastal wetlands. Our results indicate that disturbances can reduce local plant identity effects and may enhance carbon loss.

AB  - Mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds are important components of coastal blue carbon, with much higher carbon burials in sediment than those in terrestrial ecosystems. Carbon accumulation rate (CAR) is a key index to evaluate the carbon sequestration capacity of coastal blue carbon ecosystems. This review introduced the principle of a long-term monitoring system, the surface elevation table-marker horizon (SET-MH), and its application in CAR evaluation in coastal wetlands. The SET-MH methods have been globally used in blue carbon sequestration capacity assessment. The establishment of the SET monitoring systems in the coasts of China will obtain in situ data set of surface elevation change and CAR, which will serve for the blue carbon assessments and provide basic information for the national carbon neutrality strategy.

TI  - Climate change mitigation and improvement of water quality from the restoration of a subtropical coastal wetland
AB  - Coastal wetland restoration is an important activity to achieve greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets, improve water quality, and reach the Sustainable Development Goals. However, many uncertainties remain in connection with achieving, measuring, and reporting success from coastal wetland restoration. We measured levels of carbon (C) abatement and nitrogen (N) removal potential of restored coastal wetlands in subtropical Queensland, Australia. The site was originally a supratidal forest composed of Melaleuca spp. that was cleared and drained in the 1990s for sugarcane production. In 2010, tidal inundation was reinstated, and a mosaic of coastal vegetation (saltmarshes, mangroves, and supratidal forests) emerged. We measured soil GHG fluxes (CH4, N2O, CO2) and sequestration of organic C in the trees and soil to estimate the net C abatement associated with the reference, converted, and restored sites. To assess the influence of restoration on water quality improvement, we measured denitrification and soil N accumulation. We calculated C abatement of 18.5Â Mg CO2âˆ’eq haâˆ’1 yearâˆ’1 when sugarcane land transitioned to supratidal forests, 11.0Â Mg CO2âˆ’eq haâˆ’1 yearâˆ’1 when the land transitioned to mangroves, and 6.2Â Mg CO2âˆ’eq haâˆ’1 yearâˆ’1 when the land transitioned to saltmarshes. The C abatement was due to tree growth, soil accumulation, and reduced N2O emissions due to the cessation of fertilization. Carbon abatement was still positive, even accounting for CH4 emissions, which increased in the wetlands due to flooding and N2O production due to enhanced levels of denitrification. Coastal wetland restoration in this subtropical setting effectively reduces CO2 emissions while providing additional cobenefits, notably water quality improvement. Â© 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Assessing the risk of carbon dioxide emissions from blue carbon ecosystems
AB  - ``Blue carbon{''} ecosystems, which include tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows, have large stocks of organic carbon (Corg) in their soils. These carbon stocks are vulnerable to decomposition and - if degraded - can be released to the atmosphere in the form of CO2. We present a framework to help assess the relative risk of CO2 emissions from degraded soils, thereby supporting inclusion of soil Corg into blue carbon projects and establishing a means to prioritize management for their carbon values. Assessing the risk of CO2 emissions after various kinds of disturbances can be accomplished through knowledge of both the size of the soil Corg stock at a site and the likelihood that the soil Corg will decompose to CO2.

TI  - Blue carbon sinks in South Africa and the need for restoration to enhance carbon sequestration
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses) contribute towards climate change mitigation because they are efficient at sequestering atmospheric CO2 into long-term total ecosystem carbon stocks. Destruction or disturbance therefore reduces sink capacity and leads to significant CO2 emissions. This study reports the first national estimates of: 1) total carbon storage, 2) CO2 emissions from anthropogenic activities, 3) the potential for restoration to enhance carbon sequestration for blue carbon ecosystems in South Africa. Mangrove ecosystems have the greatest carbon storage per unit area (253â€“534 Mg C haâˆ’1), followed by salt marshes (100â€“199 Mg C haâˆ’1) and seagrasses (45â€“144 Mg C haâˆ’1). Salt marshes are the most extensive and contribute 67 % to the national carbon stock of 4000 Gg C. Since 1930, 6500 ha has been lost across all blue carbon ecosystems (26 % of the natural extent), equivalent to losing 1086 Gg C from the national carbon stock. Historic CO2 emissions were estimated at an average rate of 30,266 t CO2e yrâˆ’1. Despite losses, a total of 3998 ha could be restored to increase carbon sequestration and CO2 removals of 14,845 tCO2e.yrâˆ’1. Extractive activities have declined rapidly in recent decades, but abiotic pressures on estuarine ecosystems (flow modification, reduced water quality, and artificial breaching) have been increasing. There is an urgent need to quantify the potential impact of these pressures and include them in estuarine management and restoration plans. Blue carbon ecosystems cover a relatively small area in South Africa, but they are valued for their multiple ecosystem services that contribute towards climate change adaptation and biodiversity co-benefits. These ecosystems need to be included in national policies driving climate change response in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land-Use (AFOLU) sector, such as incorporating them into the wetland subcategory of the national GHG inventory.

TI  - Global trends and prospects of blue carbon sinks: a bibliometric analysis
AB  - Blue carbon sinks (mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses) are considered an effective nature-based approach for climate change mitigation. Despite growing interest, a systematic review of this topic is still scarce. This study evaluated 1348 blue carbon sink-related articles from 1990 to 2020 using bibliometric technology. The results from total of 85 countries, 1538 institutions, and 4492 authors indicated that blue carbon sink research shows the characteristics of rapid growth. The most active country, institution, and author were USA, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Duarte C.M., respectively. Relatively close academic collaboration has formed in blue carbon science. Environmental Sciences was the most popular category with 590 papers. The percentages of articles related to mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses were 63.87%, 40.36%, and 40.65%, respectively. Mangrove carbon sinks are the most popular topic, and stable isotope and remote sensing are the most researched technologies for mapping and quantifying blue carbon sinks. The threats to blue carbon sinks are complex and distinctive. Restoration, conservation, and management of blue carbon ecosystems aimed to improve their carbon sink capacity are becoming hot issues and should be further investigated in the future. These findings provide a scientific roadmap for further research in this field and will enable stakeholders to identify the research trend.

TI  - Phosphorus limitation of coastal ecosystem processes
AB  - Primary production in coastal wetlands is conventionally thought to be limited by nitrogen. Although the plant community in a pristine salt marsh was found to be limited primarily by nitrogen availability, the bacteria[community in the soil was limited by phosphorus. Hence, in coastal wetlands, and possibly in many ecosystems, individual trophic groups may respond differently to nitrogen and phosphorus loading. Phosphorus limitation of the growth of nitrogen-transforming bacteria will affect carbon fixation, storage, and release mediated by plants, a result that has important implications for ecosystem management.

TI  - Carbon dioxide fluxes reflect plant zonation and belowground biomass in a coastal marsh
AB  - Coastal wetlands are major global carbon sinks; however, they are heterogeneous and dynamic ecosystems. To characterize spatial and temporal variability in a New England salt marsh, greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes were compared among major plant-defined zones during growing seasons. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes were compared in two mensurative experiments during summer months (2012-2014) that included low marsh (Spartina alterniflora), high marsh (Distichlis spicata and Juncus gerardii-dominated), invasive Phragmites australis zones, and unvegetated ponds. Day-and nighttime fluxes were also contrasted in the native marsh zones. N2O fluxes were measured in parallel with CO2 and CH4 fluxes, but were not found to be significant. To test the relationships of CO2 and CH4 fluxes with several native plant metrics, a multivariate nonlinear model was used. Invasive P. australis zones (-7 to -15 mu mol CO2.m(-2).s(-1)) and S. alterniflora low marsh zones (up to -14 mu mol CO2.m(-2).s(-1)) displayed highest average CO2 -uptake rates, while those in the native high marsh zone (less than -2 mu mol CO2.m(-2).s(-1)) were much lower. Unvegetated ponds were typically small sources of CO2 to the atmosphere (< 0.5 mu mol CO2.m(-2).s(-1)). Night-time emissions of CO2 averaged only 35\% of daytime uptake in the low marsh zone, but they exceeded daytime CO2 uptake by up to threefold in the native high marsh zone. Based on modeling, belowground biomass was the plant metric most strongly correlated with CO2 fluxes in native marsh zones, while none of the plant variables correlated significantly with CH4 fluxes. Methane fluxes did not vary between day and night and did not significantly offset CO2 uptake in any vegetated marsh zones based on sustained global warming potential calculations. These findings suggest that attention to spatial zonation as well as expanded measurements and modeling of GHG emissions across greater temporal scales will help to improve accuracy of carbon accounting in coastal marshes.

TI  - Reclamation-induced tidal restriction increases dissolved carbon and greenhouse gases diffusive fluxes in salt marsh creeks
AB  - Intertidal creeks play an important role in transporting nutrients between coastal ecosystems and ocean. Reclamation is a predominant anthropogenic disturbance in coastal regions; however, the influence of reclamation on carbon and nitrogen species and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in creek remains unclear. In a subtropical salt marsh of eastern China, the seasonal patterns of dissolved carbon (DOC, DIC, CO2, and CH4) and inorganic nitrogen (NH4+-N, NO2--N, and NO3--N and N2O) species, and the diffusive fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O, were compared between the natural tidal creeks and the reclaimed creeks. Due to notably changed hydrological and biological conditions in the reclaimed creeks, concentrations of all dissolved carbon species, NH4+-N and NO2--N increased significantly by 60.2-288.2\%, while NO3--N and N2O decreased slightly, compared to the natural tidal creeks. DIC and NO3--N were the primary components of the total dissolved carbon and inorganic nitrogen in both creek types; however, their proportions decreased as a result of elevated DOC, CO2, CH4, NH4+-N, and NO2--N following reclamation. Significantly higher global warming potential (0.58 +/- 0.15 g CO2-eq m(-2) d(-1)) was found in the reclaimed creeks, making them hotspot of greenhouse effects, compared to the natural tidal creeks. Our results indicated that changes in flow velocity, salinity, Chlorophyll a, and pH were themain factors controlling the dissolved carbon and nitrogen and consequent GHG emissions, due to reclamation. This study is helpful in understanding of carbon and nitrogen sink-source shifts resulting from land use changes in coastal wetlands. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mangrove and Freshwater Wetland Conservation Through Carbon Offsets: A Cost-Benefit Analysis for Establishing Environmental Policies
AB  - Mexico has extensive coastal wetlands (4,243,137 ha), and one of its most important sites is the Alvarado Lagoon System, located in the Papaloapan River Basin on the Gulf of Mexico. The land cover dedicated to livestock and sugarcane has increased: by 25 % in 2005 and 50 % in 2010, with a loss of wetland vegetation and the carbon that it stores. We found that the Net Present Value of mangrove carbon offsets profit is equal to $5822.71, that of broad-leaved marshes is $7958.86, cattail marshes $5250.33, and forested wetlands $8369.41 per hectare, during a 30-year-carbonoffset contract. However, the opportunity cost from conserving wetland instead of growing sugarcane is positive according to REDD+ methodology, e.g., broad-leaved marsh conservation ranged from $6.73 to $20 USD/t CO2e, that of cattail marshes from $12.20 to $32.65 USD/t CO2e, and forested wetlands from $7.15 to $20.60 USD/t CO2e, whereas the opportunity cost between conservation and livestock was negative, it means that conservation is more profitable. The cost-benefit analysis for assessing investment projects from a governmental perspective is useful to determine the viability of conserving coastal wetlands through carbon offset credits. It also shows why in some areas it is not possible to conserve ecosystems due to the opportunity cost of changing from one economic activity (livestock and sugarcane) to carbon offsets for protecting wetlands. Furthermore, it allows for a comparison of carbon markets and assessment in terms of REDD+ and its methods for determining the social cost per ton of carbon avoided.

TI  - Modelling blue carbon farming opportunities at different spatial scales
AB  - There is a growing interest in including blue carbon ecosystems (i.e., mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses) in climate mitigation programs in national and sub-national policies, with restoration and conservation of these ecosystems identified as potential activities to increase carbon accumulation through time. However, there is still a gap on the spatial scales needed to produce carbon offsets comparable with terrestrial or agricultural ecosystems. Here, we used the Coastal Blue Carbon InVEST 3.7.0 model to estimate future net carbon sequestration in blue carbon ecosystems along Australia's Great Barrier Reef (hereafter GBR) catchments, considering different management scenarios (i.e., reintroduction of tidal exchange through the removal of barriers, sea level rise, restoring low lying land) at three different spatial scales: whole GBR coastline, regional (14,000-16,300 ha), and local (335-370 ha) scales. The focus of the restoration (i.e., tidal marshes and/or mangroves) was dependent on data availability for each scenario. Furthermore, we also estimated the monetary value of carbon sequestration under each management scenario and spatial scale assessed in the study. We found that large scale restoration of tidal marshes could potentially sequester an additional similar to 800,000 tonnes of CO(2)e by 2045 (potentially generating AU\$12 million based on the average Australia carbon price), with greater opportunities when sea level rise is accounted for in the modelling. Also, we found that regional and local projects would generate up to 23 tonnes CO(2)e ha(-1) by the end of the crediting period. Our results can guide future decisions in the blue carbon market and financing schemes, however, the return on investment is dependent on the carbon price and funding scheme available for project implementation.

TI  - Effects of warming and altered precipitation on plant and nutrient dynamics of a New England salt marsh
AB  - Salt marsh structure and function, and consequently ability to support a range of species and to provide ecosystem services, may be affected by climate change. To better understand how salt marshes will respond to warming and associated shifts in precipitation, we conducted a manipulative experiment in a tidal salt marsh in Massachusetts, USA. We exposed two plant communities (one dominated by Spartina patens-Distichlis spicata and one dominated by short form Spartina alterniflora) to five climate manipulations: warming via passive open-topped chambers, doubled precipitation, warming and doubled precipitation, extreme drought via rainout shelter, and ambient conditions. Modest daytime warming increased total aboveground biomass of the S. alterniflora community (24%), but not the S. patens-D. spicata community. Warming also increased maximum stem heights of S. alterniflora (8%), S. patens (8%), and D. spicata (15%). Decomposition was marginally accelerated by warming in the S. alterniflora community. Drought markedly increased total biomass of the S. alterniflora community (53%) and live S. patens (69%), perhaps by alleviating waterlogging of sediments. Decomposition was accelerated by increased precipitation and slowed by drought, particularly in the S. patens-D. spicata community. Flowering phenology responded minimally to the treatments, and pore water salinity, sulfide, ammonium, and phosphate concentrations showed no treatment effects in either plant community. Our results suggest that these salt marsh communities may be resilient to modest amounts of warming and large changes in precipitation. If production increases under climate change, marshes will have a greater ability to keep pace with sea-level rise, although an increase in decomposition could offset this. As long as marshes are not inundated by flooding due to sea-level rise, increases in aboveground biomass and stem heights suggest that marshes may continue to export carbon and nutrients to coastal waters and may be able to increase their carbon storage capability by increasing plant growth under future climate conditions.

TI  - The influence of Spartina maritima on carbon retention capacity in salt marshes from warm-temperate estuaries
AB  - Salt marshes constitute highly productive systems playing an important role on ecosystem functions. The aim of this study is to compare the role of Spartina maritima salt marshes on carbon cycling. Thus, four salt marshes located in two mesotidal estuarine systems (Tagus and Mondego, two salt marshes per estuary) were studied. The S. maritima above- and belowground biomass, carbon production, decomposition rates (through a litterbag experiment) and carbon content in the sediment were estimated for a one year period in both systems and compared. In Corroios (located at the Tagus estuary) S. maritima salt marsh had the highest belowground production (1008gCm-2y-1), slower decomposition rate (k=0.0024d-1), and the highest carbon content in sediments (750gCm-2y-1); and thus, the highest carbon retention capacity. The other three salt marshes had comparatively higher aboveground productions, higher decomposition rates and lower carbon retention capacity. Therefore, Corroios had the most important carbon cycling characteristics. As a whole, results show that differences in carbon cycling in salt marshes depend mostly on its own characteristics and maturity, rather than the system itself. The intrinsic characteristics of the salt marshes, namely the physicochemical conditions determined by the maturity of the system, are more important factors affecting the role of warm-temperate mesotidal salt marshes as carbon sinks.

TI  - Plant manipulations and diel cycle measurements test drivers of carbon dioxide and methane fluxes in a Phragmites australis-invaded coastal marsh
AB  - Invasion of coastal marshes by Phragmites australis may alter carbon cycling, including fluxes of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Understanding patterns and drivers of these GHG fluxes in P. australis-invaded coastal marshes is critical to predicting how this widespread biological invasion may impact carbon (C) sequestration in coastal marshes. The objectives of this study were (1) to test effects of P. australis aboveground vegetation removal on GHG fluxes over short timescales (up to 4 months) and (2) to contrast diel patterns of GHG fluxes in P. australis-vegetated and cleared plots. First, effects of mechanical aboveground P. australis biomass removal on GHG fluxes and soil variables were tested over a series of short-term durations (from min to months). Next, on 3 dates, GHG fluxes were measured every 3 h over complete diel cycles. Net daytime CO2 uptake (-60 to 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) was observed where P. australis was left intact. All durations of vegetation removal produced similar CO2 emissions to those measured from intact P. australis plots during evening hours. CH4 fluxes did not differ where P. australis was removed or left intact. Greater daytime CH4 emissions (75-100 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) were found than at night (20-40 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) from both cleared and vegetated plots. Results of this study suggest that CO2 fluxes in this system vary primarily due to substantial photosynthetic uptake by P. australis, and that CH4 emissions are likely driven by abiotic factors, such as temperature, that vary on diel cycles. Calculation of net GHG fluxes in this P. australis-invaded coastal marsh indicates that it is a GHG sink during the growing season. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Environmental Controls, Emergent Scaling, and Predictions of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Fluxes in Coastal Salt Marshes
AB  - Coastal salt marshes play an important role in mitigating global warming by removing atmospheric carbon at a high rate. We investigated the environmental controls and emergent scaling of major greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) in coastal salt marshes by conducting data analytics and empirical modeling. The underlying hypothesis is that the salt marsh GHG fluxes follow emergent scaling relationships with their environmental drivers, leading to parsimonious predictive models. CO2 and CH4 fluxes, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), air and soil temperatures, well water level, soil moisture, and porewater pH and salinity were measured during May-October 2013 from four marshes in Waquoit Bay and adjacent estuaries, MA, USA. The salt marshes exhibited high CO2 uptake and low CH4 emission, which did not significantly vary with the nitrogen loading gradient -1 (5-126 kg.ha(-1).year ) among the salt marshes. Soil temperature was the strongest driver of both fluxes, representing 2 and 4-5 times higher influence than PAR and salinity, respectively. Well water level, soil moisture, and pH did not have a predictive control on the GHG fluxes, although both fluxes were significantly higher during high tides than low tides. The results were leveraged to develop emergent power law-based parsimonious scaling models to accurately predict the salt marsh GHG fluxes from PAR, soil temperature, and salinity (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency = 0.80-0.91). The scaling models are available as a user-friendly Excel spreadsheet named Coastal Wetland GHG Model to explore scenarios of GHG fluxes in tidal marshes under a changing climate and environment.

TI  - Carbon storage and sediment trapping by Egeria densa Planch., a globally invasive, freshwater macrophyte
AB  - Invasive plants have long been recognized for altering ecosystem properties, but their long-term impacts on ecosystem processes remain largely unknown. In this study, we determined the impact of Egeria densa Planch, a globally invasive freshwater macrophyte, on sedimentation processes in a large tidal freshwater region. We measured carbon accumulation (CARs) and inorganic sedimentation rates in submerged aquatic vegetation SAV dominated by E. densa and compared these rates to those of adjacent tidal freshwater marshes. Study sites were chosen along a range of hydrodynamic conditions in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California, USA, where E. densa has been widespread since 1990. Cores were analyzed for bulk density, % inorganic matter, % organic carbon, 210Pb, and 137Cs. Our results show that E. densa patches constitute sinks for both â€œblue carbonâ€ and inorganic sediment. Compared to marshes, E. densa patches have greater inorganic sedimentation rates (E. densa: 1103â€“5989 g mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1, marsh: 393â€“1001 g mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1, p &lt; 0.01) and vertical accretion rates (E. densa: 0.4â€“1.3 cm yrâˆ’1, marsh: 0.3â€“0.5 cm yrâˆ’1, p &lt; 0.05), but similar CARs (E. densa: 59â€“242 g C mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1, marsh: 109â€“169 g C mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1, p &gt; 0.05). Sediment stored by E. densa likely reduces the resilience of adjacent marshes by depleting the sediment available for marsh-building. Because of its harmful traits, E. densa is not a suitable candidate for mitigating carbon pollution; however, currently invaded habitats may already contain a meaningful component of regional carbon budgets. Our results strongly suggest that E. densa patches are sinks for carbon and inorganic sediment throughout its global range, raising questions about how invasive SAV is altering biogeochemical cycling and sediment dynamics across freshwater ecosystems.

TI  - Impacts of Age and Expansion Direction of Invasive Spartina alterniflora on Soil Organic Carbon Dynamics in Coastal Salt Marshes Along Eastern China
AB  - Invasion of Spartina alterniflora has been reported to modify carbon (C) cycling processes and pools of the native salt marsh ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how the invasion age and expansion direction of S. alterniflora impact the soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. In this study, by considering the continuous invasion of S. alterniflora into mudflat (seaward) and native species Suaeda salsa (landward) salt marshes over a period of 20 years chronosequence, we quantify their impacts on SOC dynamics along the coastal salt marshes of Yancheng National Nature Reserve of China, based on the extensive field sampling and remote sensing data. The results showed that (1) S. alterniflora invasion increased SOC concentration and density, which averaged 8.39 g C kg(-1) and 0.0085 g C cm(-3) seaward and 6.26 g C kg(-1) and 0.0065 g C cm(-3) landward, respectively; (2) soil organic carbon showed a significantly positive relationship with total nitrogen (TN), salinity, and water content and a negative relationship with pH and bulk density for S. alterniflora landward expansion. For seaward expansion, it showed a similar relationship, but there are higher correlations with soil properties except an insignificant relationship with pH; and (3) soil organic carbon and carbon accumulation rate are significantly higher in seaward than in landward. However, for landward expansion, soil organic carbon concentration keeps increasing linearly with invasion time, while for seaward expansion, it increased to a maximum in 11 years of invasion and then decreased. Our results showed that it is very important to assess the effects of invasion on SOC dynamics in salt marsh ecosystems by considering both the expansion direction and invasion age.

TI  - Relative sea-level change regulates organic carbon accumulation in coastal habitats
AB  - Because coastal habitats store large amounts of organic carbon (C org ), the conservation and restoration of these habitats are considered to be important measures for mitigating global climate change. Although future sea-level rise is predicted to change the characteristics of these habitats, its impact on their rate of C org sequestration is highly uncertain. Here we used historical depositional records to show that relative sea-level (RSL) changes regulated C org accumulation rates in boreal contiguous seagrassâ€“saltmarsh habitats. Ageâ€“depth modeling and geological and biogeochemical approaches indicated that C org accumulation rates varied as a function of changes in depositional environments and habitat relocations. In particular, C org accumulation rates were enhanced in subtidal seagrass meadows during times of RSL rise, which were caused by postseismic land subsidence and climate change. Our findings identify historical analogs for the future impact of RSL rise driven by global climate change on rates of C org sequestration in coastal habitats. Â© 2018 The Authors.

TI  - Sources and chemical stability of soil organic carbon in natural and created coastal marshes of Louisiana
AB  - Coastal marshes are globally important for sequestering carbon, yet sea-level rise and anthropogenic stressors can reduce their capacity as carbon sinks. Marsh restoration can offset a portion of carbon loss through the degradation of natural marshes, but potential differences in the sources and stability of soil organic carbon (SOC) between created and natural marshes may affect their function as a long-term carbon sink. Here, we examine the sources and chemical stability of SOC in natural and created marshes across the Gulf coast of Louisiana, USA. Marshes were examined along an estuarine salinity gradient in a former interdistributary basin of the Mississippi River Delta and in six created marshes across a 32-year chronosequence and a natural reference marsh (n = 6) in the Chenier Plain. Carbon source was assessed using Î´13C analysis and chemical stability was determined through an acid hydrolysis digestion that removed labile carbon (LC). Soil Î´13C values suggested that the local vegetation dominated SOC in all natural marshes although brackish marshes had a mix of sources and degradation of SOC. Recalcitrant carbon (RC) was 72.2 Â± 0.5 % of SOC across fresh, brackish and saline marshes. The depth-averaged RC accumulation rate was almost three times greater than LC accumulation rate, yet both contributed significantly to accretion and long-term SOC accumulation (124â€“132 g mâˆ’2 yâˆ’1 in natural marshes). RC and SOC accumulation rate increased with mineral sediment accumulation rate. For the created marshes, SOC became increasingly recalcitrant due to an increase in in-situ plant inputs, but accumulation rates were lower than the natural marshes. Overall, this study illustrates that natural marshes have a large stock of RC from the vegetation while dredge sediment created marshes have no plant-derived carbon initially, which accumulates slowly thereafter. Restoration practices may be improved by preserving and augmenting these deteriorating but carbon-rich natural marshes. Â© 2023

TI  - Wave-energy dissipation: Seaweeds and marine plants are ecosystem engineers
AB  - Ocean waves deliver an immense amount of energy to coasts around the planet, powering high-velocity flows that interact with nearshore marine plants and animals. Although some of these interactions are beneficial, it is often advantageous for subtidal and intertidal ecological communities if wave-induced water velocities can be reduced by safely dissipating wave energy. This function is often fulfilled by seaweeds and marine plants, which thereby act as ecosystem engineers, modifying the environment to the benefit of the community. Recent advances in hydro-mechanical theory help to explain the mechanisms by which vegetation dissipates wave energy, highlighting the role that organismsâ€™ tendency to bend in flow-their structural flexibility-plays in their ability to engineer wave-induced flows. Here, I review these theories and their application to salt marsh plants, seagrasses, mangroves, and seaweeds, focusing on the ways that marine vegetation serves a foundational role in community function.

TI  - Tipping Points in the Mangrove March: Characterization of Biogeochemical Cycling Along the Mangrove-Salt Marsh Ecotone
AB  - Coastal wetland vegetation communities can respond to sea level rise via the encroachment of more salt- and inundation-tolerant species into existing vegetation communities. Black mangroves (Avicennia germinans L.) are encroaching on saltgrass (Distichlis spicata L.) within the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge in east central Florida (USA). Nine soil cores collected along three transects captured the transitions of both perceived abiotic drivers (salinity and inundation) and vegetation communities during both high- and low-water seasons to investigate patterns in soil biogeochemical cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). Results showed no change in soil carbon dioxide production along the ecotone during either season, though changes in enzyme activity and mineralization rates of N and P could indicate changes in C quality and nutrient availability affecting C degradation along the ecotone. All parameters, excluding microbial biomass carbon, showed higher rates of activity or availability during the low-water season. Long-term soil nutrient stores (total C, N, P) were greatest in the saltgrass soils and similar between the mangrove and transition zone soils, indicating a `tipping point' in biogeochemical function where the transition zone is functionally equivalent to the encroaching mangrove zone. Indicators of current biogeochemical cycling (that is, enzyme activity, potentially mineralizable N rates, and extractable ammonium concentrations) showed alterations in activity across the ecotone, with the transition zone often functioning with lower activity than within end members. These indicators of current biogeochemical cycling change in advance of full vegetation shifts. Increases in salinity and inundation were linked to mangrove encroachment.

TI  - Addressing global warming and biodiversity through forest restoration and coastal wetlands creation
AB  - The Climate Challenge is a partnership between the Department of Energy and the electric utility industry to reduce, avoid, and sequester greenhouse gases. A portion of the initiative, the sequestration of greenhouse gases, is the focus of this presentation. Over 4 million acres of bottomland hardwood forests were cleared for agriculture in the Mississippi River Valley in the 1970s. Reestablishing these forests would improve depleted wildlife habitats, serve as wildlife corridors, increase biodiversity, and decrease soil erosion. Also, Louisiana is losing coastal wetlands at a rate of approximately 25 square miles/year. This coastal erosion is due to a number of factors and many efforts are currently underway to address the matter. One such effort is the use of material generated in the dredging of navigational canals; however, this material is low in nutrient value, making the regeneration of marsh grasses more difficult. In addition, bottomland hardwood forests and coastal wetland grasses are excellent 'carbon sinks' because they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and store it in living plant tissue. Entergy Services, Inc. is an electric utility with a service territory that comprises portions of both the Lower Mississippi River Valley and the Gulf of Mexico coastline. This provides an opportunity to positively address both habitat losses noted above while at the same time addressing global warming, forest fragmentation, and biodiversity. Entergy, through its affiliation with the UtiliTree Carbon Company, is participating in projects that will investigate the feasibility of using bottomland hardwood reforestation on cleared marginal farmlands now managed by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Entergy has also begun a research project with the Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Louisiana. The research is a compost demonstration project that will utilize wood waste generated through our tree-trimming program as a compost material that will be mixed with low nutrient dredge material to create new coastal wetlands. Taken together, Entergy's initiatives will be able to address global warming through carbon sequestration, restore fragmented forest habitats, reduce coastal erosion and improve the quality of a vital coastal aquatic nursery habitat. Efforts will be made to manage the created habitats for biodiversity. Pulling all these ideas together creates an effect in which the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. In such a synergy of ideas, there are no losers and the winners are both industry participants and the environment.

TI  - Reviews and syntheses: Calculating the global contribution of coralline algae to total carbon burial
AB  - The ongoing increase in anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is changing the global marine environment and is causing warming and acidification of the oceans. Reduction of CO2 to a sustainable level is required to avoid further marine change. Many studies investigate the potential of marine carbon sinks (e.g. seagrass) to mitigate anthropogenic emissions, however, information on storage by coralline algae and the beds they create is scant. Calcifying photosynthetic organisms, including coralline algae, can act as a CO2 sink via photosynthesis and CaCO3 dissolution and act as a CO2 source during respiration and CaCO3 production on short-term timescales. Longterm carbon storage potential might come from the accumulation of coralline algae deposits over geological timescales. Here, the carbon storage potential of coralline algae is assessed using meta-analysis of their global organic and inorganic carbon production and the processes involved in this metabolism. Net organic and inorganic production were estimated at 330 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and 900 g CaCO3 m(-2) yr(-1) respectively giving global organic/inorganic C production of 0.7/1.8 x 10(9) t C yr(-1). Calcium carbonate production by free-living/crustose coralline algae (CCA) corresponded to a sediment accretion of 70/450 mm ky r(-1). Using this potential carbon storage for coralline algae, the global production of free-living algae/CCA was 0.4/1.2 x 10(9) t C yr(-1) suggesting a total potential carbon sink of 1.6 x 10(9) tonnes per year. Coralline algae therefore have production rates similar to mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses representing an as yet unquantified but significant carbon store, however, further empirical investigations are needed to determine the dynamics and stability of that store.

TI  - Increased Organic Carbon Burial in Northern Florida Mangrove-Salt Marsh Transition Zones
AB  - Blue carbon habitats like salt marshes and mangroves bury large amounts of carbon with limited area; however, they also are increasingly susceptible to current climate change. Combined effects of rising temperatures, decreasing freeze frequencies, and increasing sea level rise rates are resulting in mangrove replacement of salt marshes along the southern United States. Surface soils analyzed here from wetlands along northern Florida Atlantic and Gulf Coasts showed higher apparent sedimentation rates in mangrove-dominated sites (1.5-3.2 mm yr(-1)) and where mangroves are migrating into the marsh (termed transition sites, 2.3-3.8 mm yr(-1)). Average carbon burial rates were higher in transition sites for both coasts (27-47 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) compared to the respective mangrove (10-22 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) and salt marsh (4-7 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) sites. Lignin biomarker data (?-6, ?-8, and C/V) indicated that mangrove and transition sites had higher lignin inputs from woody vascular plants compared to salt marsh sites, which may slow decadal- to centennial-scale decay. Higher amino acid concentrations in mangrove soils relative to mangrove biomass (1.8-2.3 mmol g C-1 vs. 0.2-0.9 mmol g C-1) and lower C/N indicated that these mangrove sites receive higher algal inputs than the transition and salt marsh sites, attributed to greater tidal inundation in the mangrove sites given their position near the shoreline. Overall, increased accretion, carbon burial, and lignin in mangrove transition sites indicate that this migration may increase carbon burial and increase the stability and residence time of buried soil carbon. Future studies on mangrove migration in northern Florida can verify this through replication and elevation analysis.

TI  - Influence of the Wax Lake Delta sediment diversion on aboveground plant productivity and carbon storage in deltaic island and mainland coastal marshes
AB  - Coastal Louisiana is experiencing a significant loss of coastal wetland area due to increasing sea level rise, subsidence, sediment starvation and marsh collapse. The construction of large scale Mississippi River sediment diversions is currently being planned in an effort to help combat coastal wetlands losses at a rate of &gt;50 km-2 y-1. The Wax Lake Delta (WLD) is currently being used as a model for evaluating potential land gain from large scale diversions of Mississippi River water and sediment. In this study, we determine the impact of the WLD diversion on plant production at newly formed islands within the delta and adjacent, mainland freshwater marshes. Plant aboveground productivity, sediment nutrient status and short term accretion were measured at three locations on a transect at each of three fresh water marsh sites along Hog Bayou and at six newly formed emerging island sites in the delta. Spring flooding has resulted in a greater increase in plant production and consequently, greater carbon sequestration potential in adjacent mainland marshes compared to the newly formed island sites, which contain less total carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in the sediment. While sediment diversions are predicted to create land, as seen in island formation in the WLD, the greatest benefit of river sediment diversions from a carbon credit perspective might be to the adjacent freshwater mainland marshes for several reasons. Both greater plant production and sediment C accumulation are two important factors for marsh stability, while perhaps even more critical, is the prevention of the loss of stored sediment C in the marsh profile. This stored C would be lost without the introduction of freshwater, nutrients and sediment through river sediment diversion efforts. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Differential Capacity of Carbon Sequestration Potential: Analyzing Avicennia marina and Salicornia brachiata along the South-Eastern Coast of India
AB  - The various plant parts of a mangrove, Avicennia marina and a salt marsh, Salicornia brachiata, namely leaves, stems, and roots from Tamil Nadu, India, were analyzed for variation in their carbon sequestration potential for a period during July 2019 to August 2020. The investigations were done using a carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur analyzer. The carbon (C) concentration for different seasons revealed a maximum value of 447.26 g C kg-1 (44.726\%) in leaves of A. marina recorded during premonsoon months at Nagapattinam, and the minimum of 269.57 g C kg-1 (26.957\%) in the roots during monsoon season at Thoothukudi. Similarly, the maximum value of 514.08 g C kg-1 (51.408\%) was recorded in leaves of S. brachiata during post-monsoon at Nagapattinam and the minimum of 183.26 g C kg-1 (18.326\%) during monsoon in roots at Thoothukudi. The physicochemical parameters such as bulk density, pH, sediment organic matter, and microbial loads of A. marina and S. brachiata reported considerable variation. The mean value of soil organic carbon in A. marina was 24.92 g C kg-1 and 8.04 g C kg-1 in S. brachiata. There was a significant difference in sediment organic matter between the stations (p . 0.01). Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy was carried out to identify the functional groups such as amides amines, carbonyl-containing compounds, and alcohols in the sediments of both the species; it was observed that a major broadband around 3621 cm-1 assigned to be due to hydrogen-bonded O-H stretching vibration and another band around 1052 cm-1 due to C-N stretch. Regardless of their significance, information on the current spatial dispersion (event and degree) of mangroves and salt marshes is fragmented.
