TI  - Economic assessment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a marine fuel for CO2 carriers compared to marine gas oil (MGO)
AB  - CO2carriers are considered as a solution for CO2transport as a part of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and ship fuel cost is an important parameter impacting total cost of CO2shipping. Heavy fuel oil (HFO) is a traditional marine fuel but alternative marine fuels such as MGO and LNG shall be considered for future researches on CO2shipping because low sulphur content fuel is required in sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs) from January 2015. However, LNG has not been seriously considered as a marine fuel for CO2carriers and its economic feasibility has not been studied so far. This paper assesses economics of LNG fueled CO2carriers based on a CO2shipping scenario in North Sea and fuel price in June 2016. Parameter studies are conducted to understand the influence of important parameters such as a marine fuel price, LNG fuel system cost, and small LNG distribution cost. The results show that LNG fueled CO2carriers are more cost-effective than CO2carriers utilizing MGO based on fuel price in June 2016 and when crude oil price is higher than approximately 30â€“50 USD/bbl. Furthermore, technology development on LNG fuel system and bunkering infrastructure could strengthen the competitiveness of LNG as a marine fuel for CO2carriers. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Dynamic modelling and energy analysis of offshore compressed air storage in the North Sea region
AB  - Among the methods suggested for addressing the intermittency of renewable energy resources, compressed air energy storage (CAES) is considered a promising method due to its relatively low cost, scalability, fast response time, and simplicity of design and operation. In this work, we investigate the dynamic behavior of the storage of compressed air in the gas reservoirs of the North Sea using the existing infrastructures. The curtailment, i.e. stopping the windmills when the supply is much higher than the demand for electricity, is a problem in the North Sea. It is expected that this problem becomes more severe in near future with the installation of new windfarms that quadruples the windmills in the North Sea. Simultaneously, there is a political agreement to end the oil and gas production in the Danish sector of the North Sea, which makes the infrastructures available for alternative usage. The large space of the gas reservoirs that are connected to the platforms already equipped with transport pipelines, compressors, and turbines can be utilized for the storage of surplus and curtailed electricity. Here, we develop a simulator that links a dynamic model of the air flow in the gas reservoirs with the compressors and turbines and the time series data of the fluctuating wind electricity production to determine the efficiency of the process. Since the pressure change during the storage and production of air is governed by a parabolic diffusion equation, we study the effect of the permeability of the reservoir and near-well region on the overall exergy loss of the process. Moreover, since the mixing of the injected air (oxygen) with volatile hydrocarbons in the reservoir poses a big risk, we create an insitu combustion model to quantify the impacts of a potential explosion in the reservoir. We suggest a preemptive measure by pre-injecting a carbon dioxide cushion before starting the CAES process. Finally, we compare the amount of carbon dioxide emission that can be avoided in the North Sea region by CAES process compared to the alternative use of the reservoir for carbon dioxide storage.

TI  - DAS SYSTEM MODELING AND DATA VALIDATION FOR CCS MONITORING
AB  - Monitoring of CCS facilities with fiber optic has increased rapidly over the last six years. As part of carbon capture and storage monitoring fiber optic tools have been deployed at different test sites. This monitoring has taken advantage of enhancements in distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) technology. Here we present a workflow to assess optimal optical acquisition to acquire seismic signals, passive and active, that are needed for permanent reservoir surveillance. We present data from new DAS interrogators units capable of sensing long distances that would encompass CCS projects being developed on land and offshore. Data presented here includes active seismic within a shallow CCS facility connected to a long fiber optic line. In addition the long range technology is validated for passive induced seismicity surveillance. We demonstrate that the fiber optic DAS systems have high sensitivity needed for high resolution imaging of storage facilities and for detectability of potential induced events during permanent injection monitoring.

TI  - Geochemical tracers for monitoring offshore CO2 stores
AB  - Chemical tracers are proposed as an effective means of detecting, attributing and quantifying any CO2 leaks to surface from geological CO2 storage sites, a key component of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology. A significant proportion of global CO2 storage capacity is located offshore, with some regions of the world having no onshore stores. To assure regulatory bodies and the public of CO2 storage integrity it is important to demonstrate that robust offshore monitoring systems are in place. A range of chemical tracers for leakage have been tested at onshore pilot CCS projects worldwide, but to date they have not been trialled at injection projects or CO2 release experiments located offshore. Here, for the first time, we critically review the current issues surrounding commercial scale use of tracers for offshore CCS projects, and examine the constraints and cost implications posed by the marine environment. These constraints include the logistics of sampling for tracers offshore, the fate of tracers in marine environments, tracer background levels, marine toxicity and legislative barriers - with particular focus on the Europe and the UK. It is clear that chemicals that form a natural component of the CO2 stream are preferable tracers for ease of permitting and avoiding cost and risks of procuring and artificially adding a tracer. However, added tracers offer more reliability in terms of their unique composition and the ability to control and regulate concentrations. We identify helium and xenon isotopes (particularly 124,129Xe), and artificial tracers such as PFCs and deuterated methane as the most suitable added tracers. This is due to their conservative behaviour, low environmental impact and relative inexpense. Importantly, we also find that SF6 and C-14 are not viable tracers for CCS due to environmental concerns, and many other potential tracers can be ruled out on the basis of cost. Further, we identify key challenges that are unique to using tracers for offshore monitoring, and highlight critical uncertainties that future work should address. These include possible adsorption or dispersion of tracer compounds during ascent through the overburden, longevity of tracers over the timeframes relevant for CCS monitoring, the permissible environmental effects of tracer leakage, and tracer behaviour in seabed CO2 bubble streams and in dissolved CO2. These uncertainties directly affect the selection of appropriate tracers, the injection program and concentrations necessary for their reliable detection, and appropriate sampling approaches. Hence offshore tracer selection and associated expense are currently poorly constrained. Further, there is limited experience of sampling for tracers in the marine environment; current approaches are expensive and must be streamlined to enable affordable monitoring strategies. Further work is necessary to address these unknowns so as to evaluate the performance of potential tracers for CO2 leak quantitation and provide more accurate costings for effective offshore tracer monitoring programs.

TI  - Coal-based, ultra-clean, high efficient fuel cell hybrid power generation
AB  - Siemens Power Generation heads one of three teams engaged in development of ultraclean, highly efficient, fuel cell/gas turbine hybrid power systems in coal-fired power plants. Under the sponsorship of the U. S. Department of Energy s National Energy Technology Laboratory, the Fuel Cell Coal-Based Systems initiative targets systems with a minimum plant thermal efficiency of 50% on a high heating value basis, greater than 90% carbon dioxide capture, and zero emissions of criteria pollutants. The program extends work already underway in the Department of Energy s Solid State Energy Conversion Alliance (SECA) to hybrid fuel cell/turbine plants of greater than 100 MWe scale and operating on coal-based synthesized fuel. The program further extends the SECA product cost goal of $400/kWe for the power island in an Integrated Gasified Fuel Cell (IGFC) power plant. The program culminates in system demonstrations, at multi megawatt scale, in the FutureGen or other host generating plant. This paper discusses alternative hybrid cycles under consideration, methods for carbon dioxide separation, and development steps necessary for fuel cell operation on synthesized fuels. The paper also discusses test facilities and methodologies for preliminary bench scale verification of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) operation under pressurized conditions typical of the hybrid cycles.

TI  - Capture of CO2 using water scrubbing
AB  - Conceptual power plant CO2 capture processes involving conventional chemical and physical solvents require extensive processing to recycle the solvent and to prepare the separated CO2 for disposal. The use of water as a once-through solvent in a CO2 capture process avoids the need for separation Of CO2 from the solvent with potential savings in energy and cost. To minimise water requirements the scrubbing process needs to be operated at high pressure and is therefore best suited to integration with an IGCC process. The large flow of water required, and the need to discharge the resulting solution Of CO2 into deep water, dictates that seawater scrubbing Of CO2 from a coastal power plant is the most likely application of the concept. This paper reports on an assessment study that evaluates the potential for seawater scrubbing as a CO2 mitigation technology. In addition to a technical and economic analysis of the concept, other issues examined include; the impact of the discharge of acidified water into the deep ocean environment and the availability of suitable coastal locations for installation of an IGCC power plant with CO2 capture using water scrubbing.

TI  - Impact potential of hypersaline brines released into the marine environment for CCS reservoir pressure management
AB  - The environmental impact potential arising from the possible disposal of hypersaline brines into the ocean as part of reservoir pressure management for Carbon Capture and Storage is assessed using sophisticated high-resolution hydrodynamic models for the first time, investigating several industry guided scenarios. Although the characteristics of some brines in their undiluted form would have a high environmental impact potential, we find that dispersion in a hydrodynamically active region like the North Sea acts to dilute disposed brine rapidly, even in a worst case approach, such that the potential impact footprint (area exposed to environmentally damaging salinity or temperature) is small, measured in 10's of meters depending on the release scenario and site specific data such as the hypersaline water contaminants along with in-situ conditions such as currents and mixing. The method of brine disposal has a significant influence on dispersal, such that brines released nearer the sea surface disperse more rapidly, compared with release at the seabed. Hence consideration of brine release height is recommended to further limit impact potential.

TI  - Availability assessment of a power plant working on the Allam cycle
AB  - The availability of a power production system utilizing the Allam cycle is modelled and analysed. First, a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis is conducted to identify the main failure modes of system's components. Generalized Stochastic Petri nets as dynamic model for supporting a Monte Carlo simulation are used to evaluate the availability of a test case of an Allam cycle system. The test case consists of a scenario of a power plant project using the Allam cycle, which can capture 100\% CO2 and therefore can be used in offshore oil and gas production units by reinjecting CO2 in the wells to maintain reservoir pressure. The failure data for the components are taken from OREDA that contains failure rates of offshore equipment. Simulation results on the availability of the system and other production parameter are obtained considering corrective maintenance alone. Finally, a parametric study demonstrates the effect of variation of mean time to failure and mean time to repair on system performance. This study can help in optimizing operation and maintenance actions in complex production systems.

TI  - Logical Analysis on the Strategy for a Sustainable Transition of the World to Green Energy-2050. Smart Cities and Villages Coupled to Renewable Energy Sources with Low Carbon Footprint
AB  - This paper brings, as an element of novelty and originality, a strategic feasibility study, in the form of a logical analysis related to the proposed objective, with particularization to the area of the EFTA plus the UK and Ireland. We tried to achieve an overall picture of a sustainable and prudent transition at the macroeconomic level, but also at the microeconomic and local levels, with specific values of ecological and energy-smart villages/towns. The convergent actions of the signatory states of the climate treaty COP-26/2021-Glasgow, UK are to improve the logistics and financing of the large-scale replacement of fossil fuels used in the economy and lives of human society. Various strategies have been discussed to address the energy mixes that could be used in the transition phase in stages and combined-cycle natural-gas plants, conditioned by the implementation of CCUS technology. The preliminary stage will focus on the provision and implementation of modern technologies for the production of electricity in photovoltaic and wind power. Starting with the 2030s, the industrialized production of blue and green hydrogen is expected; the first is expected to be obtained from the chemical synthesis of natural gas with the separation and storage of residual carbon from chemical reactions, and the second directly from ocean water through the phenomenon of H2O electrolysis. As a basic legislative element, the strategy aims to refine the idea of a carbon tax at the border or at the user, in order to discourage the use of fossil fuels.

TI  - Performance prediction and evaluation of CO2 utilization with conjoined electrolysis and carbonation using desalinated rejected seawater brine
AB  - The study of the simultaneous oceanic and atmospheric pollutant treatment process is proposed and evaluated based on the simulation performance. High contents of metal ions and low costs are some of the advantages in using desalinated rejected brine, which allows to have a stable feedstock source and to take some steps toward a sustainable electrolysis environment. By using metal cations present in desalinated wastewater, carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technology can overcome the limitations in present technologies. Mineral carbonation at ambient temperature using electrolysis has been designed. To evaluate the proposed process, a simulation compromising both electrolysis of brine and carbonation process is applied to estimate the energy consumption. As a result, about 91.3% of CO2 is captured from flue gas, and CaCO3 and MgCO3 are produced as final products. The simulation results reveal that operational cost is highly dependent on the electricity price, so different scenarios were consulted to assess the economic feasibility of the process. The proposed design was compared with alternative CCUS technology to comment on their limitations and viability of its application. Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Deviations from environmental baseline: Detection of subsea CO2 release in the water column from real-time measurements at a potential offshore Carbon Dioxide Storage site
AB  - Within the framework of the STEMM-CCS project, a controlled CO2 release experiment was conducted under real-life conditions in the Goldeneye complex area, a depleted gas field located in the UK sector of the North Sea. Here, the viability of water column monitoring for the detection of the injected CO2 is evaluated. Real-time pH and pCO2 measurements were taken in the water column during the CO2 release experiment. Monitoring was carried out throughout the full water column, from the near-seafloor to the sea surface, in order to assess the spatial extent of the CO2 release. The dispersion of the CO2 plume was strongly influenced by tidal circulation in the area. The strongest signals were detected within 8 m of the bubble stream during low tide. The lowest pH and highest pCO2 values were 7.965 and 942.1 mu atm, respectively, corresponding to variations of 16.4\% {[}H+] and 125.6\% from baseline values. The pCO2 baseline dynamics of Goldeneye area were assessed by the evaluation of the natural pCO2-O2 covariance. The estimation of seasonal thresholds for anomalous pCO2 (pCO2:O2 ratio May= 1.63 +/- 0.04) allowed us to assess with confidence the non-biological origin of the detected CO2 during the release experiment.

TI  - Techno-economic assessment of polygeneration based on fluidized bed gasification
AB  - The electric power sector contributes to about a quarter of the total CO2 emissions worldwide. Therefore, in most mitigation scenarios for the climate change the share of low-carbon electricity supply increases from the current share of approximately 30% to more than 80% by 2050. A promising approach is the polygeneration concept for electrical power and chemicals based on integrated gasification combined cycle. It offers the possibility to capture CO2 in a very efficient pre-combustion process and is able to accommodate the intermittent renewable power generation from wind and solar while operating the gasification island at full load by producing synthetic chemical products during times of low power demand. In this work, a process model of a polygeneration plant including a 350 MWel combined cycle power plant with a fluidized bed dryer, a fluidized bed gasifier, a gas purification unit, a CO-Shift unit, a Rectisol acid gas removal, and a synthesis reactor array is developed. The model is used to investigate the specific CO2 emissions and the process efficiency for different operation modes for power and methanol production. The model offers two options to introduce excess electricity from renewable sources into the process: via hydrogen from electrolysis or via additional drying and heating of the feedstock. The influence on the process efficiency and the economics are assessed. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - A proposal of zero-emission ship service premising the GHG storage into aquifers under ocean floor
AB  - For a drastic reduction of GHG emission from the ship service, the idea to liquidize and store CO2 in tanks on board was investigated premising the GHG storage in the aquifers under ocean floor. As a result, ethane is the most appropriate fuel for boiler/turbine system because its fluidization pressure and temperature are similar to those of liquid CO2, which enables the empty fuel tanks to store 76 percent of captured CO2. Oxygen can be supplied from membrane-type air separation system on board. The total cost of the proposed system is estimated to 22.6 USD / CO2 ton if the waste heat from the main engine can be available for power generators.

TI  - Will gas be gone in the United Kingdom (UK) by 2050? An impact assessment of urban heat decarbonisation and low emission vehicle uptake on future UK energy system scenarios
AB  - The UK government has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 80%, from 1990 levels, by 2050. Decarbonisation of transport and heat supply to buildings is recognised as a fundamental step in achieving this target. With cities being the largest producers of GHG emissions they provide the biggest opportunity for climate change mitigation. Two contrasting visions of a 2050 target-compliant scenario are evaluated against each other. One is based on a high penetration of nuclear power and renewables the other based on predominantly gas with carbon capture storage (CCS). An impact assessment is carried out on both scenarios to understand how each scenario might perform over 4 evaluation criteria. The evaluation criteria provide insight into each scenario regarding; guaranteeing security of supply, scenario cost, sustainability and how feasible it is to deploy the chosen technologies. Whilst both scenarios raise discussion points on the feasibility of deploying certain technologies the more favourable scenario, in terms of the study results, is the nuclear and renewables option. The renewable energy generating technologies included as part of the study â€“ from largest to smallest in terms of capacity â€“ are wind, solar photovoltaic, tidal and river hydro. The outputs of this study provide an important contribution to academic debate on what might be the most effective approach to achieving the 2050 decarbonisation target. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - First generation graz cycle power plant for near-term deployment
AB  - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a recognized technology pathway to curb the increasing emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the power generation sector. But most available technologies are still on the study or laboratory-scale level, so that considerable R&amp;D efforts are needed to achieve commercialization level. The Graz Cycle originally presented in 1995 by Jericha [1] is an oxyfuel technology and promises highest efficiency using state-of-the-art turbine materials and improved thermodynamic developments in a comparatively complex interaction of rotating machinery, condensers and heat exchanger components. But although detailed conceptual design for all main components has been presented, there is still a large step towards a Graz Cycle pilot demonstration plant. In order to facilitate construction of a demonstration plant we consider the performance of a near-term Graz Cycle process design based on modest cycle data and available turbomachinery components using a simplified flow scheme. The work is supported by on-going development work for a first generation oxyfuel turbine that has already been undertaken by Clean Energy Systems, Inc. [2]. Their further work on a second generation oxyfuel turbine received $30 million funding support from the U.S. Department of Energy in September 2010 [3]. Two near-term Graz Cycle plants are presented based on basic and advanced operating conditions of the proposed commercially available turbine. Besides the turbine the additional equipment for a first-generation cycle is discussed. The predicted optimum net efficiency is 23.2 % (HHV). A near-term zero-emission power plant can only be commercially attractive if it will be deployed in a niche market. Therefore an economic analysis commensurate with an early pre-FEED conceptual study is carried out for the U.S. Gulf Coast where revenue from multiple product streams that could include power, steam, CO2 and water, as well as argon and (potentially) nitrogen from the ASU is provided. The economic analysis suggests that a capital investment of $94 million can secure construction of a 13.2 MWe zero emission oxyfuel power plant and yield a 14.5% (unlevered) return on capital invested.

TI  - The sustainability of clean coal technology: IGCC with/without CCS
AB  - Integrated gasification combined cycle power generation (IGCC) is one of the emerging clean coal technologies for reducing greenhouse emissions in coal-fired electricity generation. IGCC technology, both with and without CO2 capture and storage (CCS) is compared with conventional super-critical power generation based on pulverized coal. The comparison is based on an equal consumption rate of Queensland black coal. The sustainability parameters being investigated are: thermal efficiency, environmental performance, inherent safety and economics. The IGCC processes have been modeled using commercial steady-state mass and energy balance software. Both the gross and net thermal efficiencies of the IGCC power station are reduced when the plant is configured for CCS. The net efficiency is reduced from 32.1% to 26.1%, when 81% of the CO2 is captured. This delivers an overall reduction in CO2 emissions per unit of electrical energy output of 73.2% compared to the reference plant. However, environmental performance in other areas suffers as a result of switching to IGCC-CCS, particularly fresh water consumption is increased by 2.5 tonne/MWh for both coastal and inland locations. Inherent safety risks associated with IGCC are also greater with the gasifier being the highest risk unit in the facility with a Dow fire and explosion index of 168 compared with an index of 107 for a conventional boiler. Toxicity hazard also increases with carbon monoxide present at concentrations several thousand times higher than the TWA limit. The minimum viable selling price of electricity for a 7% IRR is calculated to increase from USD80 MWh-1 for a conventional power station to USD101 MWh-1 for IGCC and to USD145 MWh-1 for IGCC-CCS. It is concluded that the application of IGCC-CCS is highly effective in reducing carbon dioxide emissions, the highest-profile problem associated with coal-fired electricity. There is an economic penalty which has been previously documented. However, there are also drawbacks concerning inherent safety and other environmental factors apart from CO 2 emissions, which until now have been under emphasized.

TI  - Carbon capture, utilization and storage development in Romania
AB  - Related to the Southern part of Romania, from our previous and present CCUS studies, the industrial CO2 emissions - verified on 2017, the appropriate geological structures for CO2 storage as well as oil and gas deposits for EOR and EGR, are well documented. GeoEcoMar is the single Romanian organization having in the same time high professional experience in the complex geological and geophysical studies on the Danube and the Western Black Sea Basin as well as in the CCUS studies. Evolving environmental regulatory directives have generated interest and investment to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from large point sources using carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. CCS is a suite of technologies integrated to capture and transport CO2 from major point sources to a storage site where the CO2 is injected down wells and into porous geological formations deep below the surface. There it is trapped and permanently stored. CO2 enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) is a promising option to move CCS forward by enabling development of carbon capture at industrial sites and pipeline infrastructure for CO2 transport. When executed synergistically, EOR and CCS are referred to as carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). CO2-EOR storage is being increasingly recognized as an important strategy for mitigating climate change. The use of CO2-EOR for purpose of geologic storage has many practical advantages. Literature and experts generally view CO2-EOR as a proven technology. Technologies and methodologies for injection, production and monitoring have been in use and refined over the past few decades. Other than CO2 supply and processing, candidate CO2-EOR sites typically have modest infrastructure demands, because in most cases existing wells can be used directly or with some modifications for injection and production. Finally, a number of monitoring methodologies for establishing the quantity of CO2 stored have been demonstrated. CO2-EOR operations are mainly monitored to check that bottom-hole and reservoir pressures are being maintained within the operational constraints, to track the movement of the CO2 injected, and to ensure that the wells are complying with integrity standards especially due to the potential for flow assurance problems stemming from the corrosive nature of CO2 in pipelines and hydrate forming hazards. Monitoring and surveillance for these objectives are usually implemented via gauges for injection/production and pressure data, geochemical analysis of produced fluids, and well logs and/or downhole sensors that measure tracer concentration, fluid saturations, resistivity and casing integrity. Seismic surveys have also been used to monitor for CO2 plume movement. Additional monitoring requirements for storage include demonstrating integrity of the producing reservoir, verification of the quantity of stored CO2, wellbore integrity monitoring, plume pathways monitoring, near-surface monitoring, and surface monitoring.

TI  - Evaluation of large-scale CO2 storage on fresh-water sections of aquifers: An example from the Texas Gulf Coast Basin
AB  - Large-scale injections Of CO2 into subsurface saline aquifers have been proposed to remediate climate change related to buildup of green house gases in the atmosphere. The pressure buildup caused by such injections may impact a volume of the basin significantly larger than the CO2 plume itself In areas with hydrological settings similar to the Gulf Coast Basin, the perturbation of the flow-field in deep parts of the basin could result in brines or brackish water being pushed up-dip into unconfined sections of the same formations or into the capture zone of fresh-water wells. The premise of the current study is that the details of multiple-phase flow processes necessary to model the near field evolution of the CO2 plume are not necessary to describe the impact of the pressure anomaly on up-dip aquifers. This paper quantitatively explores conditions under which shallow groundwater would be impacted by up-dip displacement of brines, utilizing an existing carefully calibrated flow model. Modeling an injection of water, arguably equivalent to 50 million tons of CO2/year for 50 years resulted in an average water-table rise of similar to 1 in, with minor increase in stream baseflow and larger increase in ground water evapotranspiration, but no significant change in salinity.

Benefits from offshore wind farms (OWFs) may extend further than low CO2 energy production. Wind turbine substructures introduce hard surfaces that are rapidly colonised by epibenthic marine organisms, altering biomass and biodiversity within the local ecosystem. Biodiversity plays a critical role in supporting ecosystem processes and functions that maintain ecosystem services. As offshore wind development continues to grow and modify marine habitats, changes in biodiversity could affect the provision of ecosystem services. In this context, this review sets out to capture the current understanding of epibenthic biodiversity change following the installation of OWFs and attempt to link these changes in biodiversity with marine ecosystem services through the associated processes and functions.

TI  - Impact of CO2-WAG design optimisation on coupled CO2-EOR and storage projects in carbonate reservoirs
AB  - CO2-WAG injection has been applied in offshore Brazilian carbonate reservoirs aiming to improve oil recovery and promote a safe destination to CO2 naturally being produced alongside with hydrocarbon gas. A gas reutilisation strategy can potentially lead to multiple benefits: residual oil saturation reduction, maintenance of reservoir pressure, avoidance of gas flaring and development of the infrastructure and expertise necessary to make CO2 storage more accessible once oil production is complete, paving the path for a low carbon future, whereas mature basins can be a potential hub for Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS). This study aims to develop a methodology to design CO2-WAG projects that not only achieve a high Net Present Value (NPV) but also maximizes the capacity and safety of geological CO2 storage.

TI  - Optimising energy footprint for offshore CO2 separation, transportation and storage
AB  - This paper describes the experience of PETRONAS in sustainable development of a high CO2 gas field. The development project which have a potential of storing 23MTPA of CO2 in a nearby offshore saline aquifer is energy intensive. The operational cost of operating the high duty CO2 capture, transport and reinjection (or CCS) facilities has a negative impact on the overall project economics. As such, optimizing the energy footprint of the CCS facilities is imminent. As a means to achieve the desired duty reduction, the project have identified potential energy recovery from the high pressure well stream via the adiabatic turboexpander gas expansion, deployment and integration of the liquid CO2 pumps as opposed to the conventional higher duty compressor systems and utilizing low BTU gas turbine drivers to avoid the high duty fuel gas separation penalty. The aggregate duty reductions achieved has met the initial project expectation. However, the deployment of these technology is rather new for offshore service and a proper technology qualification exercise is a necessity. Copyright 2014, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Three layers of energy law for examining CO2 transport for carbon-capture and storage
AB  - This research is a legal analysis concerning four scenarios for cross-border carbon dioxide (CO2) transport that could increase the deployment of carbon-capture and storage (CCS) deployment in Europe. The legal analysis categorizes the law into three levels-international, national and local-and considers the four scenarios in light of these three levels of energy law. Upon reviewing the four scenarios, it is clear that the Rotterdam Nucleus (referred to as the `Pilot Case') is the leading scenario and as a result it is explored in more detail. The potential Pilot Case is based on the development of Rotterdam (in the Netherlands) as a southern North Sea hub. Under this Rotterdam Nucleus scenario, captured CO2 will be transported through the Port of Rotterdam to depleted gas fields offshore the Netherlands. CO2 will also be transported through further links using CCS infrastructure to facilitate the processing of undeveloped gas fields offshore UK. The Pilot case contemplates further expansion opportunities, increasing the capture clusters through additional pipelines, expanding to further gas fields and using the port of Rotterdam for CO2 shipping-hence the analysis of the other scenarios may be invaluable in the future development of CO2 networks in the EU. Finally, and an original contribution of this article is that it employs the three lawyers of energy law theoretical framework to an energy problem that was examined by an interdisciplinary research team. Furthermore, this research was developed further through two key industry stakeholder meetings with CCS experts in the EU.

TI  - Human and environmental impact assessment of postcombustion CO2 capture focusing on emissions from amine-based scrubbing solvents to air
AB  - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) has become a key technology in climate change mitigation programs worldwide. CCS is well-studied in terms of greenhouse gas emission reduction potential and cost of implementation. Impacts on human health and the environment have, however, received considerably less attention. In this work, we present a first assessment of human health and environmental impacts of a postcombustion CO2 capture facility, focusing on emissions from amine-based scrubbing solvents and their degradation products to air. We develop characterization factors for human toxicity for monoethanolamine (MEA) as these were not yet available. On the basis of the limited information available, our assessment indicates that amine-based scrubbing results in a 10-fold increase in toxic impact on freshwater ecosystems and a minor increase in toxic impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. Theseincreases are attributed to emissions of monoethanolamine. For all other impact categories, i.e., human toxicity, marine ecotoxicity, particulate matter formation, photochemical oxidant formation, and terrestrial acidification, the CO2 capture facility performs equally well to a conventional NGCC power plant, albeit substantial changes in flue gas composition. The oxidative degradation products of MEA, i.e., formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and ammonia, do not contribute significantly to total environmental impacts. Â© 2010 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Investigation of CO2 storage potential of the Durban basin in South Africa
AB  - The mitigation of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions through technologies such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) has been internationally identified as one of the major technical approaches that can be used to combat global climate change in fossil fuel dominated countries. The South African Centre of Carbon Capture and Storage (SACCCS) was established in 2009 to investigate the potential for CCS in the country. Results from a country-scale assessment of CO2 storage potential suggest that South Africa has a theoretical storage capacity of âˆ¼150 Gt, of which 98% occurs offshore in Mesozoic sedimentary basins preserved on the submerged continental shelf. This paper will discuss the progress associated with the ongoing investigation of CO2 storage potential in the 10 000 km2, offshore Durban basin on the east coast of South Africa. With the use of existing data and information the geological development and CO2 storage suitability of the offshore Durban basin is assessed. The basin is structurally complex, hosting a number of horst and graben structures but is dominated by the Tugela Cone, a Tertiary-age, deep-water fan complex that is located seaward of the continental shelf. Although not formally given formation status, sequence stratigraphic correlation can be applied to the Jurassic to Cretaceous succession, separating it into four formations based upon onshore sequences in the Zululand basin to the north. Formations are namely; Syn-Rift, Makatini, Mzinene, St Lucia. Cenozoic sediments range in thickness from âˆ¼1300 m to âˆ¼2000 m comprising a variety of lithologies that cap the sequence. Re-analysis of existing legacy 2D seismic and exploration borehole data has been undertaken in the context of CCS to assess the CO2 prospectivity, geological evolution, and depositional architecture of this portion of the South African continental shelf.

TI  - Adapting the Technology Performance Level Integrated Assessment Framework to Low-TRL Technologies Within the Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage Industry, Part I
AB  - With the urgent need to mitigate climate change and rising global temperatures, technological solutions that reduce atmospheric CO2 are an increasingly important part of the global solution. As a result, the nascent carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) industry is rapidly growing with a plethora of new technologies in many different sectors. There is a need to holistically evaluate these new technologies in a standardized and consistent manner to determine which technologies will be the most successful and competitive in the global marketplace to achieve decarbonization targets. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic assessment (TEA) have been employed as rigorous methodologies for quantitatively measuring a technology's environmental impacts and techno-economic performance, respectively. However, these metrics evaluate a technology's performance in only three dimensions and do not directly incorporate stakeholder needs and values. In addition, technology developers frequently encounter trade-offs during design that increase one metric at the expense of the other. The technology performance level (TPL) combined indicator provides a comprehensive and holistic assessment of an emerging technology's potential, which is described by its techno-economic performance, environmental impacts, social impacts, safety considerations, market/deployability opportunities, use integration impacts, and general risks. TPL incorporates TEA and LCA outputs and quantifies the trade-offs between them directly using stakeholder feedback and requirements. In this article, the TPL methodology is being adapted from the marine energy domain to the CCUS domain. Adapted metrics and definitions, a stakeholder analysis, and a detailed foundation-based application of the systems engineering approach to CCUS are presented. The TPL assessment framework is couched within the internationally standardized LCA framework to improve technical rigor and acceptance. It is demonstrated how stakeholder needs and values can be directly incorporated, how LCA and TEA metrics can be balanced, and how other dimensions (listed earlier) can be integrated into a single metric that measures a technology's potential.

TI  - A model for analysis of integrated gasification combined cycle power plant with carbon dioxide capture
AB  - Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) is believed to be one of the most promising technologies to offer electricity and other de-carbon fuels with carbon capture requirement at a relatively low cost. With the process of carbon dioxide capture, it can also actually meet strict regulations for other pollutants emission. However, the performances can vary depending on what kinds of technologies or processes are used. This paper has developed a model and calculated by using Engineering Equation Solver (EES) program to determine and compare different available technologies and processes. There are four main components in the model: Gasification Island; Gas Cleanup Island; Carbon Dioxide Capture Island and Power Island. Among them, the different options of Gasification Island; and Carbon Dioxide Capture Island are expected to be the most effective factors to influence the performance of the plant. Therefore, different gasification processes are examined in this paper, including Shell, GE (Texaco) and Lurgi. The carbon dioxide capture processes are based on SELEXOL, a physical absorption process, because of the high partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the syngas. A process called "double-absorption" is used for capturing sulfur compounds and carbon dioxide. This paper calculated and compared the net outputs, efficiency penalties for CO2 capture part, and net plant efficiencies for different technologies and processes by using EES program. This model tries to treat the IGCC with carbon dioxide capture part as a whole thermal system, instead of just looking at the capture system alone. Different gasification technologies mentioned above will result in various paths and efficiencies of using steam and waste energy in the system. It will make reasonable use of various waste energies and steams for both mechanical and chemical processes to improve the performance of the plant, and incorporate a CO2 capture system into the design concept of the power plant.

TI  - Technology of CO2 capture and storage
AB  - This paper studies carbon capture and storage based on carbon emission. There are three main technical routes for CO2 emission reduction: pre-combustion capture, oxygen-rich combustion, and post-combustion capture; CO2 separation technology mainly includes: chemical absorption method, solid adsorption method, membrane separation method. CO2 capture needs to be transported to a special place for storage, which can be generally divided into geological storage, marine storage and chemical storage. Future carbon capture research will focus on cost savings and energy savings. Â© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.

The NCLRDM can determine ports of call, call sequence, ship type and service frequency simultaneously with the objective of minimizing state subsidies for coastal shipping operators under a given carbon emission reduction target for the entire intermodal network. A network-topology method (Temporal-Spatial Expansion) captures differences in traffic assignment between waterway and highway networks. A genetic and Frank-Wolfe hybrid algorithm is used to solve the NCLRDM. The model is applied to the Bohai Bay in China. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Strategies for detection and monitoring of CO2 leakage in sub-seabed CCS
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (CCS) in sub-seabed geological formations is currently being studied as a potential option to mitigate the accumulation of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere. For the verification of CO2 storage integrity in the sub-seafloor, developments of the techniques to detect and monitor CO2 leaked from the seafloor is vital. Seafloor-based acoustic tomography is a technique that can be used to detect emissions of liquid CO2 droplets or gas CO2 bubbles from the seafloor. An in-situ pH/pCO(2) sensor can provide rapid and high-precision measurements in seawater, and is therefore able to detect pH and pCO(2) changes caused by the leaked CO2. An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) installed with the pH/pCO(2) sensor provides an automated observation technology that can detect and monitor CO2 leakage from the seafloor. By towing a multi-layer monitoring system consisting of a number of pH/pCO(2) sensors and transponders, the dispersed area of leaked CO2 overlying a CCS site can also be identified. The seafloor-mounted automatic elevator consists of a buoy equipped with pH/pCO(2) and depth sensors, collecting intermittently a CTD-like data as it ascends and descends. Hence, CO2 leakage from the seafloor is detected and monitored as follows. Step 1: detect the CO2 leakage by the seafloor-based acoustic tomography. Step 2: map the distribution of the leakage points using the pH/pCO(2) sensor installed on the AUV. Step 3: monitor the impacted area using a remotely operated underwater vehicle or the automatic elevator or by towing the multi-layer monitoring system. (C) 2013 The Authors.

TI  - Behavioral responses of brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) to reduced seawater pH following simulated leakages from sub-sea geological storage of CO2
AB  - Large-scale storage of CO2 within sub-sea geological formations is a viable option for reducing the volume of this greenhouse gas released directly to the atmosphere from anthropogenic activities. Risks to benthic marine life following possible leakage of gas through the seabed from this carbon capture and storage (CCS) initiative are not yet well established. This study examined behavior (activity patterns) in brown shrimp (Crangon crangon), exposed to a range of reduced seawater pH conditions (7.6, 7, or 6.5) simulating leakage scenarios of varying scales. Brown shrimp have an endogenous rhythmicity associated with their activity, which dictates they are most active during hours of darkness, presumably as protection against vision-dependent predators. This endogenous rhythm in activity continues to be expressed when shrimp are held under constant low-light conditions in the lab and provides an ecologically relevant endpoint to measure when examining the influence of reduced pH on the behavior of these animals. No marked differences in activity pattern were observed between control shrimp maintained at pH 8.1 and those at pH 7.6. However, changes in activity were evident at pH 7 and pH 6.5, where significant shifts in timing and intensity of activity occurred. There was an unexpected increase in activity within periods of expected light, probably signaling efforts by shrimp to migrate away from reduced seawater pH conditions. The loss of this important member of the benthic community due to migration may have important consequences for many of the resilient species that remain. Â© 2016 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Effect of Seawater, Aluminate Cement, and Alumina-Rich Spinel on Pelletized CaO-Based Sorbents for Calcium Looping
AB  - Calcium looping (CaL) is considered as an emerging technology to reduce CO2 emissions in power generation systems and carbon-intensive industries. The main disadvantage of this technology is reactivity decay over carbonation/calcination cycles due to sintering. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of novel sorbents for CaL. Three types of pelletized CaO-based sorbents for CO2 capture were developed by adding aluminate cement, aluminate cement with seawater, or alumina-rich spinel to calcined limestone. Different concentrations of seawater in deionized water solutions were tested: 1, 10, 25, and 50 vol %. All samples were tested in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) under two different calcination conditions: mild (N2 atmosphere and 850 Â°C during calcination) and realistic (CO2 atmosphere and 950 Â°C during calcination). The samples were characterized using SEM and EDX. Aluminate cement CaO-based sorbents exhibited better performance in the TGA tests (25% conversion after 20 cycles achieved by limestone and 35% with aluminate cement CaO-based pellets, under mild conditions, and 11% conversion after 20 cycles with limestone compared to 15% utilizing aluminate cement CaO-based pellets, under realistic conditions). However, doping had a negative effect on the reactivity of the sorbent. Moreover, alumina rich spinel CaO-based sorbents showed the worst performance. Â© 2019 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Comparative life cycle assessment of tidal stream turbine blades
AB  - Renewable energy allows electricity generation with lower environmental and resource impact than generation from fossil fuels. However, the manufacture, use and ultimate disposal of the equipment used to capture renewable energy has an environmental impact. This impact should be minimised. Most tidal turbine blades are currently manufactured from glass or carbon fibre reinforced polymers. Such blades cannot be recycled at the end of their life, and are disposed of in landfill or by incineration. As the tidal energy industry grows, the volume of non-recyclable waste is a potential problem. Here we consider the environmental impact of ten combinations of material and disposal method for tidal stream turbine blades, including recyclable options. Our findings suggest that: â€¢ Glass fibre blades have greenhouse gas emissions of around 15,500 kgCO2e for the scope considered, and a significant environmental impact in all impact categories. â€¢ Steel blades are heavy and have greater material and manufacturing greenhouse gas emissions than glass fibre blades, but these are partly offset by recycling. â€¢ Carbon fibre blades have the greatest impact of the cases considered in greenhouse gas, human toxicity, and marine toxicity. The impact is particularly large when disposed of in landfill. â€¢ Composite materials using flax fibre and recyclable resin may have lower impact (26% lower greenhouse gas emissions than glass fibre), provided they are treated correctly after use. These materials may also offer the potential for lower cost blades in future. Â© European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference 2021.

TI  - Green and efficient configuration of integrated waste heat and cold energy recovery for marine natural gas/diesel dual-fuel engine
AB  - Energy conservation and emission reduction form a dominant theme in our time, hence, researchers urgently need to develop green and efficient technologies to adapt to new rules. To achieve the cascade utilization of waste heat and cold energy as well as meet the daily energy and life requirements of ships, a green and efficient configuration is proposed, which include the analysis and matching of supercritical and subcritical Rankine cycles, comprehensive utilization of liquefied natural gas cold energy, carbon separation and capture, and hydrocarbon adsorption. Foremost, the simulation results are compared with the literature data to verify the accuracy of the proposed integrated system. Subsequently, a point-by-point analysis of the operation parameters that affect the system performance is performed. In addition, the method for the efficient utilization of cold energy, and the contribution of quantitative cold energy are proposed. After obtaining the optimal operation conditions, the economic and thermodynamic performance of the cold energy recovery system and integrated system is calculated. The results demonstrate that the integrated system is feasible in economy and could meet the daily needs of the ship. The output work, energy efficiency, and exergy efficiency reach 270.78 kW, 26.89\% and 54.33\%, respectively. Finally, after the installation of the energy-saving technology, the system shows excellent emission reduction characteristics. Therefore, the configuration is found to be an effective implementation of a novel idea for energy conservation and emission reduction.

TI  - An Investigation into the Logistical and Economical Benefits of using Offshore Thermal Power in a Future CCS Scheme
AB  - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is an increasingly popular scheme to mitigate CO2 emissions from large point sources (IPCC 2005). Thermal power plants account for a large portion of the world's total CO2 emissions and are therefore the most attractive target for CCS. For a typical thermal power plant; the process would involve capturing the CO2, transporting it to a suitable location for storage and storing it in a manner that will ensure minimal leakage over a very long period of time. Due to public concerns and protests regarding storage onshore, offshore geological storage of CO2 is most likely to be used for future projects (Winden et al. 2011). The successful implementation of CCS thus depends on the feasibility of capturing the CO2, transporting it to an offshore site and injecting it deep beneath the seabed. Pilot projects such as the Sleipner rig in Norway have already proven the feasibility of using offshore geological storage and post combustion technology for capturing CO2 can also be considered mature. No long distance, large scale transportation solutions for CO2 has yet been proven to work with satisfactory results. Transportation of CO2 is thus identified as an area where breakthroughs could lead to forward leaps in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. This paper presents a study on a possible future way of solving CO2 transportation issues associated with the use of CCS. Geological storage locations are located in the sedimentary basins which is where oil and gas reserves are also found. The issue of transporting CO2 from an onshore power plant to an offshore storage site can thus be compared to the issue of transporting natural gas from an offshore extraction site to an onshore power plant or production facility. This is conventionally done using either ships or pipelines. This paper investigates the cost competitiveness of using the third alternative of Gas To Wire (GTW) where the gas is combusted offshore. This eliminates the need for transportation altogether and the concept has already been proven to be attractive for exploiting certain gas fields. It is shown here that the concept is even more attractive in a scenario where CCS is used since it eliminates two transportation issues. In this study, the transportation cost of natural gas and CO2 is compared to the costs of sub-sea High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) electrical cables and is shown to be higher. Pipelines have a large potential to be the most economical way of transporting CO2 to most prospective storage sites in the future (Winden et al. 2011) and will therefore be used to represent a conventional method of CO2 transportation in this study. For comparison, the alternative of transporting by ship or using a pipeline-ship combination will also be presented briefly. Initial studies show that the reduction in transportation costs compared to all conventional methods would more than offset the increased costs of operating a power plant offshore. It is also shown that the gains in transportation cost will decrease the Levelised Cost Of Energy (LCOE) for an example scenario located in Western Australia.

TI  - Low carbon electricity systems for Great Britain in 2050: An energy-land-water perspective
AB  - The decarbonisation of the power sector is key to achieving the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global mean surface temperature rise to well below 2 Â°C. This will require rapid, national level transitions to low carbon electricity generation, such as variable renewables (VRE), nuclear and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage, across the world. At the same time it is essential that future power systems are sustainable in the wider sense and thus respect social, environmental and technical limitations. Here we develop an energy-land-water nexus modelling framework and use it to perform a scenario analysis with the aim of understanding the planning and operational implications of these constraints on Great Britain's (GB) power system in 2050. We consider plausible scenarios for limits on installed nuclear capacity, siting restrictions that shape VRE deployment and water use for thermal power station cooling. We find that these factors combined can lead to up to a 25% increase in the system's levelised cost of electricity (LCOE). VRE siting restrictions can result in an up to 13% increase in system LCOE as the deployment of onshore wind is limited while nuclear capacity restrictions can drive an up to 17% greater LCOE. We also show that such real-world limitations can cause substantial changes in system design both in terms of the spatial pattern of where generators are located and the capacity mix of the system. Thus we demonstrate the large impact simultaneously considering a set of nexus factors can have on future GB power systems. Finally, given our plausible assumptions about key energy-land-water restrictions and emission limits effecting the GB power system in 2050, the cost optimal penetration of VREs is found to be at least 50%.

TI  - Assuring the integrity of offshore carbon dioxide storage
AB  - Carbon capture and storage is a key mitigation strategy proposed for keeping the global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees C. Offshore storage can provide up to 13\% of the global CO2 reduction required to achieve the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change goals. The public must be assured that potential leakages from storage reservoirs can be detected and that therefore the CO2 is safely contained. We conducted a controlled release of 675 kg CO2 within sediments at 120 m water depth, to simulate a leak and test novel detection, quantification and attribution approaches. We show that even at a very low release rate (6 kg day(-1)), CO2 can be detected within sediments and in the water column. Alongside detection we show the fluxes of both dissolved and gaseous CO2 can be quantified. The CO2 source was verified using natural and added tracers. The experiment demonstrates that existing technologies and techniques can detect, attribute and quantify any escape of CO2 from sub-seabed reservoirs as required for public assurance, regulatory oversight and emissions trading schemes.

TI  - The techno-economics of alternative CO2 transport systems and their application in the Canadian oil sands industry
AB  - The rise in GHG emissions from the oil sands industry has prompted government and industry to seek ways to reduce its CO2 output. CCS is currently the leading option in Alberta. A key to making it viable is a system that allows multiple emitters to gather, capture, and transport their CO2 to the best sinks, efficiently and economically. The oil sands are located in Northern Alberta. Geological formations suitable for CO2 storage exist in the South-West region, similar to 400 km from the sources. Implementing CCS will necessitate transporting roughly 30 megatonnes of CO2 to suitable sinks. One of the best sinks is the underground aquifer in the Redwater Reef near Ft. Saskatchewan, with an estimated preliminary capacity of one gigatonne of CO2, or 37 years of CO2 emissions from oil sands, at 2007 rates. In this study, we compare two schemes to transport CO2 from oil sands operations by capturing CO2 and: 1) transporting it in its supercritical state to storage in the Redwater Reef and 2) transporting it in solution to Redwater, regenerating the solvent on-site and storing the CO2 in the Redwater Reef. The fugitive emissions of Case 1 are consistently higher than those of Case 2. This is due to the former's electricity demands and the fact that the emissions associated with energy for solvent regeneration are not captured. Case 1 is more susceptible to electricity cost fluctuations than Case 2, but the latter is more susceptible to changes in the price of fuel. Although the CAPEX is similar for both, Case 2 benefits more from economies of scale than Case 1; the OPEX for Case 1 is 3.5\% higher. The avoidance costs of Case 2 are lower on a gross basis (111 vs. 114 \$/tonne CO2) and on a net basis (327 vs. 851 \$/tonne CO2). (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - INTEGRATION OF A CAO-BASED THERMAL STORAGE SYSTEM IN AN IGCC PLANT WITH CARBON CAPTURE
AB  - Using pre-combustion CO2-capture, IGCC plants show significant potential for efficient power generation with carbon capture. The gasification and gas processing steps however have multiple temperature and flow constraints which severely limit the flexibility of IGCC plants to meet the dynamic demands of the current grid. To address this issue, a CaO-based energy storage system has recently been proposed to substantially increase the load range of a base IGCC plant without cycling the gasifier island. In this work, further storage configurations have been assessed, addressing the inefficiencies identified in previous work. In particular, the following cases have been investigated: directly fired calciners with varying make-up flow rate to minimize the purge stream energy loss, directly fired calciners with improved heat integration to reduce the calciner syngas demand and an indirectly fired calciner to minimize the ASU penalty. Additionally, an alternative storage integration strategy after the Selexol unit has been compared both with respect to its performance and its impact on the base IGCC plant design and operation. To this end, process simulation was undertaken in Aspen Plus (TM). As demonstrated, the CaO based energy storage system can be effectively used to modulate the IGCC net power output by +/- 20-25\%, while maintaining the capture capacity of 90\% of the CO2-emissions. Improvement of the particle reactivity and the internal heat recuperation were found to impact the round-trip efficiency the most.

TI  - Reducing carbon dioxide emissions with enhanced oil recovery projects: A life cycle assessment approach
AB  - A wide range of industries are investigating methods of reducing their emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Several options have been identified ranging from energy efficiency and reforestation to capture and storage in oceans, aquifers, or underground. Although greenhouse gases are not yet regulated, the power generation and petroleum industries are already considering greenhouse gas capture and storage methods to reduce their emissions to the atmosphere. Preferred options are the ones utilizing CO2 as a product and therefore providing an additional economic benefit to the oil and gas production process. Currently, CO2 is widely used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects to extract more oil out of aging reservoirs. Thus, storage of CO2 in active reservoirs does not require technology advances and offers the advantage of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. The present research conducted a life cycle assessment to determine the benefits derived from storing CO2 in active reservoirs while enhancing the extraction of oil and the impacts on the environment over the process lifetime. The potential for CO2 storage in a specific oil reservoir in Texas was demonstrated, as well as the mass balance of greenhouse gas emissions generated from the energy-intensive process. Our findings suggest that the storage capacity of this reservoir is huge, the process emissions are minimal in comparison, and the EOR activity is almost carbon-neutral when comparing net storage potential and gasoline emissions from the additional oil extracted.

TI  - Effects of wettability of rock-CO2-water systems on the migration and distribution of geologically sequestered supercritical CO 2
AB  - CO2 sequestration (capture, injection, and long-term storage) in various geologic media including depleted oil reservoirs, saline aquifers, and oceanic sediments is being considered as a possible solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Residual or capillary trapping is one of the most important mechanisms to impede the migration of supercritical (SC) CO 2 and reduce leakage risks. Capillary pressure and relative permeability are key factors in sequestration, and they are strongly affected by the interfacial properties between SC CO2, saline fluids and formation rocks. Interfacial properties are usually described by interfacial tension and contact angle. Preliminary analyses regarding the effects of wettability and entry pressure on the capacity and sealing efficiency have been presented in the literature. A few experimental observations illustrate that interfacial properties are functions of pressure, temperature, salinity and pH of formation fluids, as well as the formation rock mineralogy. The injection of SC CO2 can alter the in-situ conditions of P, T, pH, etc. in target formations, and consequentially change the interfacial tension and contact angle. In this study, numerical simulations on idealized formations are conducted to investigate the effects of SC CO2 injection induced interfacial property alteration on the capillary pressure and relative permeability, and consequently on the extent of SC CO2 migration and storage capacity. Simulations and analyses in this study are mainly concentrated on three effects of SC CO2 migration: 1) reservoir rock formation wettability; 2) capillary pressure variation; and 3) variations in relative permeability. To date, experimental measurements in the literature have been focused mostly on the variation of interfacial tension and contact angle. These effects are investigated in the research presented here by scaling the capillary pressure, calculated from the van Genuchten model, with parameters estimated from in-situ conditions (P, T, pH and salinity) using correlations determined from previous studies. By contrast, experimental investigations of the dependence of relative permeability on wettability are relatively sparse in the literature. In order to facilitate our investigation, the modified Burdine model is adapted, in which the effects of contact angle are explicitly described. It is found that the SC phase irreducible saturation increases as the SC CO 2 wettability of the reservoir formation rock is elevated, thus enhancing storage efficiency.

TI  - Detection and quantification of CO2 seepage in seawater using the stoichiometric Cseep method: Results from a recent subsea CO2 release experiment in the North Sea
AB  - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a potential significant mitigation strategy to combat climate change and ocean acidification. The technology is well understood but its current implementation must be scaled up nearly by a hundredfold to become an effective tool that helps meet mitigation targets. Regulations require monitoring and verification at storage sites, and reliable monitoring strategies for detection and quantification of seepage of the stored carbon need to be developed. The Cseep method was developed for reliable determination of CO2 seepage signal in seawater by estimating and filtering out natural variations in dissolved inorganic carbon (C). In this work, we analysed data from the first-ever subsea CO2 release experiment performed in the north-western North Sea by the EU STEMM-CCS project. We successfully demonstrated the ability of the Cseep method to (i) predict natural C variations around the Goldeneye site over seasonal to interannual time scales; (ii) establish a process-based baseline C concentration with minimal variability; (iii) determine CO2 seepage detection threshold (DT) to reliably differentiate released- CO2 signal from natural variability and quantify released- CO2 dissolved in the sampled seawater. DT values were around 20 \% of the natural C variations indicating high sensitivity of the method. Moreover, with the availability of DT value, the identification of released- CO2 required no preknowledge of seepage occurrence, but we used additional available information to assess the confidence of the results. Overall, the Cseep method features high sensitivity, automation suitability, and represents a powerful future monitoring tool both for large and confined marine areas.

TI  - CO2 Storage in Saline Aquifers: In the Southern North Sea and Northern Germany
AB  - CO2 storage in depleted gas fields is attractive but gas fields are unequally distributed geographically and can be utilized only within a restricted window of opportunity. Therefore, CO2 storage in saline aquifers can be expected to become an important element of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) systems. CO2 storage in saline aquifers is studied in the European DYNAMIS project, where special attention was paid to the relation between the geological structure, geological properties and achievable injection rates. This paper presents the results from simulations of CO2 storage in two aquifer structures. One aquifer structure is located in the English sector of the Southern North Sea and one aquifer structure located in Northern Germany. The geological model of the Southern North Sea structure was built using existing knowledge of facies geometry and distribution from literature and well logs and the overall geometry from interpreted horizons. The distributions of properties like lithology, net-to-gross ratios, porosity and permeability were stochastically modelled to represent the braided and meandering river and fan systems within the Bunter Sandstone Formation. High-porosity and high-permeability zones model fluvial channels running through the reservoir. A different approach was chosen for the North German structure. Because there is no information on the facies or petrophysical parameter distribution of the aquifer, three different model scenarios were generated. One model was created with homogeneous properties throughout the aquifer. Two other model scenarios were generated allowing the porosity and permeability to vary within certain ranges. This was done using a sequential Gaussian simulation with the known mean, minimum and maximum values of porosity and permeability, respectively. Due to the size of the aquifer structures and computing limits, up-scaling of the geological model of the Southern North Sea was required. The up-scaling was aimed to retain as much as possible of the modelled geological features such as braided river and fan systems. Several reservoir simulations were carried out in collaboration between TNO and IFP to assess CO2 injection. Given the injection rate constraints, the aim of the injection simulations was to: assess the achievable rate of injection; study the migration and behavior of the CO2 in the reservoir; assess the most appropriate location(s) for the CO2 injection wells using alternate injection strategies. The injection strategy is relevant especially for the Southern North Sea structure, where river and fan systems may results in high-permeability zones through the reservoir. Accessing such systems may significantly improve a reservoir's value for CO2 storage. The effect of such systems on the injection rates is demonstrated. The reservoir simulations also demonstrate the injection rates that can be achieved in tight reservoirs as in the North Germany case, and the effect of spatial variability of geological parameters. This will show whether it is reasonable to assume spatial geological homogeneity, when data on the reservoir formation are scarce. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved

TI  - Direct air capture of CO2: A response to meet the global climate targets
AB  - Highlights: DAC can help deal with difficult to avoid emissions. Large-scale deployment of DAC requires serious government, private, and corporate support and investment particularly to offset the capital cost as well as operational costs. Further optimizations to the costs can be found in choice of energy source as well as advances in CO2 capture technology such as high capacity and selectivity materials, faster reaction kinetics, and ease of reusability. Abstract: Direct air capture (DAC) technologies are receiving increasing attention from the scientific community, commercial enterprises, policymakers and governments. While deep decarbonization of all sectors is required to meet the Paris Agreement target, DAC can help deal with difficult to avoid emissions (aviation, ocean-shipping, iron-steel, cement, mining, plastics, fertilizers, pulp and paper). While large-scale deployment of DAC discussions continues, a closer look to the capital and operational costs, different capture technologies, the choice of energy source, land and water requirements, and other environmental impacts of DAC are reviewed and examined. Cost per ton of CO2 captured discussions of leading industrial DAC developers with their carbon capture technologies are presented, and their detailed cost comparisons are evaluated based on the choice of energy operation together with process energy requirements. Validation of two active plantsâ€™ net negative emission contributions after reducing their own carbon footprint is presented. Future directions and recommendations to lower the current capital and operational costs of DAC are given. In view of large-scale deployment of DAC, and the considerations of high capital costs, private investments, government initiatives, net zero commitments of corporations, and support from the oil companies combined will help increase carbon capture capacity by building more DAC plants worldwide.

TI  - A risk-based monitoring plan for the Fort Nelson feasibility project
AB  - The Plains CO 2 Reduction (PCOR) Partnership and Spectra Energy Transmission (SET) are investigating the feasibility of a carbon capture and storage (CCS) project near Fort Nelson, British Columbia, Canada. The project aims to reduce carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions from SET's Fort Nelson sour gas-processing plant by injecting up to 2 million tonnes of sour CO 2 (approximately 95% CO 2, 4% hydrogen sulfide [H 2S], and 1% methane [CH 4]) a year into a deep mid-Devonian-age carbonate reef for long-term geologic storage. The Fort Nelson CCS project provides a unique opportunity to develop a set of cost-effective, risk-based monitoring techniques for large-scale storage of sour CO 2 in deep saline formations. An approach is being developed that integrates characterization, modeling, risk assessment, and monitoring into an iterative process to produce superior quality results during each phase of the project. During the preinjection phase of the project, the characterization activities are used as input to the modeling effort. The results of the modeling and characterization activities are used as input to the first-round risk assessment, which helps identify knowledge gaps and project risks. The output from the risk assessment is then used to guide further characterization efforts and develop the monitoring plan. Once injection begins, the monitoring program results will be compared to the modeling predictions. The models will be adjusted as necessary, and new simulations will be run to predict the movement of the injected sour CO 2 in the reservoir. Predictions that closely match the monitoring data will strengthen the project by 1) demonstrating that the modeling can be used to accurately aid in risk identification, 2) providing insight into long-term stability of the CCS system, 3) helping to ascertain when closure conditions have been met in the postinjection phase, and 4) enabling the CCS operator to obtain CCS project closure certification. Although specific techniques and procedures may change as the project proceeds, this philosophy of integrated characterization, modeling, and risk assessment will ensure that monitoring strategies remain fit for purpose, cost-effective, and efficient throughout the life of the project.

TI  - A Japanese project to sequester CO2
AB  - A new technology to sink and store CO2 deep in the ocean is being developed by the National Maritime Research Institute, in cooperation with the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science &amp; Technology. The Cosmos project (CO2 sending technology for ocean storage) is being supported by the Japanese Railway, Construction, Transport and Technology Agency. The project's concept is to first liquefy captured CO2 at its triple point (0.52 MPa and 216.6 K) and transport the liquefied CO2 to an offshore platform. There, a slurry of liquid CO2 and dry ice is formed by pressurized crystallization of the liquid along the solid-liquid line of CO2's phase diagram. The slurry (liquid/solid = 50:50) is then injected through nozzles at a depth of about 500 m, and the mixture then sinks to a depth of up to 3500 m. Injecting the CO2 slurry (as 48-cm-dia. balls) to a depth of 200 m is sufficient for the material to sink below the critical depth of 2700 m, where the density of liquid CO2 equals that of seawater. Because of the high pressure and the low temperature at such depths, a membrane of CO2 hydrate forms at the interface between the liquid CO2 and the seawater, preventing the CO2 from being dispersed. A 1:80-scale model of the platform and injection system has been constructed, and the group plans to test the entire concept in the future.

TI  - Analysis and optimization of carbon supply chains integrated to a power to gas process in Italy
AB  - The mathematical model for carbon capture, utilization and storage supply chains is developed for Italian regions. This model is used to design supply chains minimizing total costs and reducing significantly carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon dioxide can be stored or utilized to produce methane through a power to gas system, where hydrogen is obtained by the electrolysis of water using renewable power while methane is fed to the gas grid. The Mixed Integer Linear Program model is applied to design carbon systems developed for ten regions with major carbon dioxide emissions, while different saline aquifers are proposed as storage sites. Results show that the Adriatic sea is the most appropriate offshore storage site in the supply chain. This leads to a lower net methane production cost and to the lowest level of economic incentives as compared to other cases. The total costs of this supply chain are 7.34Â·104 million â‚¬/year (953 â‚¬/tonCO2 captured), and 16.1 Mton/year of methane are produced. The supply chain does not result economically favorable without substantial financial incentives (80 â‚¬/tonCO2 for carbon tax and 260 â‚¬/MWh economic incentive for methane production). Comparing supply chains that include simultaneous utilization and storage of carbon dioxide with a carbon capture and utilization supply chain (without storage) shows that the latter is economically less favorable. In addition to mitigation of carbon environmental impact for the whole Country, the large scale supply chain proposed here meets 35% of Italy's methane demand as a whole, a significant contribution to a global economic perspective, widely discussed nowadays, which should include self-sustainment elements at regional level.

TI  - CO2 - From problem to business opportunity?
AB  - The first decision to apply underground storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) captured from natural gas - as a climate change mitigation effort - was taken by Statoil (operator) and partners in the Sleipner North Sea licence in 1990. The second such decision was taken by Statoil (operator) and partners in the SnÃ¸hvit licence in the Barents Sea in the fall of 2001. A third project of this type was put in operation in the In Salah field in Algeria. This paper presents these injection projects and possible solutions to how CO2 can be turned into a business opportunity. The whole chain of CO2 management will be covered, including capture, transportation, storage and end use of CO2.

TI  - Scope for converting an existing natural gas enhanced oil recovery project to carbon dioxide injection
AB  - This chapter examines the potential to generate electric power with natural gas used for an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) scheme. Generating electricity using natural gas currently injected for EOR in the Magnus field, and injecting the resulting CO2 instead, could possibly give low emission power at comparable costs to other new technologies, even under realistic economic conditions. This would still not be commercially viable due to the lack of support for CO2 capture and storage (CCS) schemes, but may indicate this option should be considered, as an alternative to natural gas EOR, elsewhere or in the future. The Magnus scheme would also be likely to have significant additional benefits, including helping to provide grid connections for large scale renewable generation (onshore or offshore) in Shetland and Orkney, making a contribution of 0.2% reduction in UK CO2 emissions and providing a flagship CCS+EOR project for Scotland and the UK. Hopefully future opportunities will emerge, as in the scheme proposed, to combine both cost-effective low emission generations through CCS and EOR and also long term infrastructure development for a wider range of complementary energy developments around the North Sea.

TI  - Spending review quells green technology sector anxieties
AB  - Siemens, General Electric and Mitsubishi have indicated that their investment in offshore wind turbine manufacturing in the UK was conditional on a ports upgrade. Osborne's comprehensive spending review (CSR) also indicated that support for the feed-in tariff (FiT) would remain there but savings would be made by refocusing it on the most cost-effective technologies, saving Â£40m in 2014-15. The changes will be implemented at the first scheduled review of tariffs in 2013 unless massive uptake forces the government to carry out an earlier review. Other spending for environmental groups include a Â£1bn investment to create one of the world's first commercial-scale carbon-capture and storage demonstration plants. A total of Â£860m has been planned for the Renewable Heat Incentive, which will be introduced from 2011-12. One of the revenue generating sources for the Green Investment Bank (GIB) could be the Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) Energy Efficiency Scheme.

TI  - Modelling large-scale CCS development in Europe - linking techno-economic modelling to transport infrastructure
AB  - This paper a studies the potential lay-out of CCS infrastructure in Europe, by combining techno-economic modelling of Europe's electricity sector with a detailed modelling and analysis of a CO2 transport infrastructure. First, the electricity sector is described using the Chalmers Electricity Investment Model, which, for each EU member state, yields the technology mix - including CCS - until the year 2050. The model gives the lowest system cost under a given CO2 emission reduction target. Thus, the model gives the annual flows of CO2 being captured by country and fuel. Secondly, these flows are used as input to InfraCCS, a cost optimization tool for bulk CO2 pipelines. Finally, the results from InfraCCS are applied along with Chalmers databases on power plants and CO2 storage sites - to design the development over time of a detailed CO2 transport network across Europe considering the spatial distribution of power plants and storage locations. Two scenarios are studied: with and without onshore aquifer storage. The work shows that the spatial distribution of capture plants over time along with individual reservoir storage capacity and injectivity are key factors determining routing and timing of the pipeline network. The results of this work imply that uncertainties in timing for installation of capture equipment in combination with uncertainties related to accurate data on storage capacity and injectivity on reservoir level risk to seriously limit the build-up of large-scale pan-European CO2 transportation networks. The study gives that transport cost will more than double if aquifer storage is restricted to offshore reservoirs. Thus, it is found that the total investments for the pan-European pipeline system is (sic) 31 billion when storage in onshore aquifers is allowed and (sic) 72 billion if aquifer storage is restricted to offshore reservoirs with corresponding specific cost (sic) 5.1 to (sic) 12.2 per ton of CO2 transported.

AB  - In his first environment speech as UK Prime Minister, Gordon Brown identified key roles for renewables and carbon capture and storage in the UK's future energy mix. According to Brown, new evidence suggested that the UK's emissions target of a 60% cut by 2050 could be increased to as much as 80%. With a Â£1 billion investment into wind, wave and tidal energy, Britain is committed to meeting their share of the EU's 2020 renewable energy target, which could mean the UK will have to produce between 40 and 50% of its electricity from renewable sources. Brown also announced the launch of the government's carbon capture storage competition, a decision on new nuclear plants to be made in 2008, and proposed the banning of the one-use plastic bag.

TI  - Transforming transport - Is electrification the only way forward?
AB  - Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and meeting the aim of the Paris Agreement requires worldwide action from all sectors of society. As a major emitter of energy-related CO2, the transport sector will require a transformation over the course of this century. Before, during and after the adoption of the Paris Agreement, IPIECA issued a series of publications, held dedicated workshops and hosted a number of topic-specific side events at UNFCCC COPs (Conference of Parties) to convene experts from industry, academia, think tanks and other stakeholders to produce a perspective on the potential pathways toward a low-emission future and the role of the oil and gas sector as an enabler. Building on this approach, IPIECA worked with experts within the sector and drawing upon data and literature from the IEA and other bodies to produce in-depth low-emission pathways for transport. IPIECA identified a wide range of technologies that will be necessary for transport sub-sectors (light-duty and heavy-duty road vehicles, aviation and maritime) to evolve to a low-emissions future. Continuing improvements in the efficiency of the internal combustion engines coupled with hybridization and optimized vehicle/vessel designs will provide significant GHG emission reductions. Electric vehicles are key for the light-duty sector, although the full life cycle of battery manufacture, utilization and disposal as well the sustainability of electricity generation source is particularly important if valid comparisons are to be made with internal combustion engines. More advanced biofuels, synthetic fuels, 'e-fuels' and hydrogen could also be used as a power source to improve emissions. And, there is a role for carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the production of hydrogen. Transport modes such as heavy-duty vehicles, aviation and commercial shipping need a significantly high energy density. Here electrification will present more of a challenge and there is the opportunity for use of sustainably sourced biomass as an alternative. This paper will lay out the IPIECA view on how the oil and gas industry can be part of the solution in meeting both the challenges of the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. It examines in detail potential pathways for the transformation of the transport sector and provides a perspective on the technologies and other key enablers of a low-emissions transport future.

TI  - Solid CO2 hydrates for sustainable environment: Application in carbon capture and desalination
AB  - The world population has reached 7.9 billion and is growing, which creates the necessity to manage the water-energy nexus. India's energy sector predominantly depends on coal-fired power, which generates âˆ¼ 70% of electricity while utilizing âˆ¼ 30 billion cubic meters of water (bcm) and is responsible for global warming (the increasing CO2 level) and the water crisis. In this direction, gas hydrate-based carbon capture and seawater desalination are potential technologies for clean water production while utilizing flue gas coming from coal-fired power plants. Gas or clathrate hydrates are ice-like crystalline materials that form at a suitable temperature and pressure conditions. Hydrates form a cage-like structure of water molecules while encapsulating the CO2 molecules and rejecting the salts. One mole of hydrate utilizes 85% water and 15% CO2, which is one of the motivations to develop hydrate-based desalination technology. However, sluggish kinetics of hydrate formation and low temperature or high-pressure conditions is the major bottleneck to deploying a hydrate-based approach. Therefore, in the current work, cyclopentane (CP, 6 mol%) is used as a thermodynamic promoter which shifts the hydrate forming temperature (equilibrium conditions) from 277 to 291 K at âˆ¼ 2.0 MPa pressure compared to non-CP system. Moreover, in context to enhance the rate of hydrate formation, the performance of hydrophobic amino acid (l-leucine) is evaluated for the formation kinetics of binary CP-CO2 hydrates in saline (3.5 wt% NaCl in water) and non-saline media. The experimental results indicate that salinity suppresses the water to hydrate conversion by 50% (first 60 min data). The addition of 1000 ppm l-leucine helps to enhance the initial hydrate formation rate resulting in a higher percent of hydrate conversion in lesser process time. However, kinetic inhibition effect was observed at high content of l-leucine (5000 ppm). Our findings offer new insights into integrated hydrate-based carbon capture and seawater desalination approach. Â© 2022

TI  - Optimization of a Ship-Based Logistics System for Carbon Capture and Storage
AB  - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is the process of capturing CO 2 before it enters the atmosphere, transporting it, and then storing the CO 2 in a permanent underground storage site. CCS is projected to play an important role for compliance with the temperature degree goals set by the Paris Agreement, and with this in mind, we study the so-called Ship-Based CCS Logistics Problem (SCLP). The SCLP deals with designing a cost-effective ship-based logistics system to ensure that CO 2 captured from emission sources in the hinterland of loading ports is transported to unloading ports nearby the final storage sites. As part of this, one needs to determine the intermediate storage capacities at the loading ports, ship fleet size and mix, fleet deployment and sailing speeds along each chosen route. To solve the SCLP, we propose a new mixed integer programming model, where candidate ship routes are generated as input. We use our optimization model to analyze three future supply scenarios based on estimations of the volume of captured CO 2 from emission sources in mainland Europe that is brought via ports of Antwerp, Dunkirk, Rotterdam and Wilhelmshaven to Norwegian storage sites. Our computational results show that the logistics cost per tonne of CO 2 will be around 10 Euros in low volume scenarios and drop to about 8 Euros in high demand scenarios due to economies of scale. In the considered high demand scenario for the year 2050 about 100 ships are required that perform several thousand round trips per year within the considered port network.

This paper aims to evaluate the most promising CO2 liquefaction processes that can be used for port-to-port and portâ€“offshore CO2 ship transportation. The energetic, exergetic, and economic analyses are applied. The liquefaction pressure has been set to 15 bar (liquefaction temperature âˆ’30â—¦C), which corresponds to the design of the existing CO2 carriers. The three-stage vapor-compression process has been selected among closed systems (with propane-R290, ammonia-R717, and R134a as the working fluid) and the precooled Lindeâ€“Hampson processâ€”as the open system (with R717). The three-stage vapor-compression process R290 shows the lowest energy consumption, and the CO2 liquefaction cost 21.3 USD/tCO2 . Although the power consumption of precooled Lindeâ€“Hampson process is 3.1% higher than the vapor-compression process with R209, the lowest total capital expenditures are notable. The CO2 liquefaction cost of precooled Lindeâ€“ Hampson process is 21.13 USD/tCO2 . The exergetic efficiency of the three-stage vapor-compression process with R290 is 66.6%, while the precooled Lindeâ€“Hampson process is 64.8%. Â© 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Strategies for elastic full waveform inversion
AB  - Ocean-bottom cables (OBC) have become common in reservoir monitoring of oil and gas production, and also for CO2 capture and storage experiments. Compared to conventional streamer data, OBC data contain more information, particularly about shear waves. This information may be used to estimate the P- and S-wave velocity and density models using the full waveform inversion method. In this study, we investigate different inversion strategies for estimating the three elastic parameter models. We study the difference between conventional streamer and OBC datasets in terms of recovering all three isotropic elastic parameters. We find that the streamer dataset is sufficient for recovering only the P-wave model, while the OBC dataset enables us to recover both the P-wave and S-wave models. There are, however, difficult to invert for the density model using both datasets. An update, however, was achieved by using an empirical relation in the iterations. The best inversion results were obtained using a sequential based approach, where each parameter was inverted for on a one-by-one basis. Â© 2014 SEG.

TI  - Development of CO2 injection method "cosmos" for CO2 ocean storage
AB  - Ocean storage of CO2 has been proposed by Marchetti as one of greenhouse gas control technologies, where CO2 is captured from flue gas of fossil fuels and injected into deep seafloor below the depth of 3500 m to be sequestered from the atmosphere. The outline of the COSMOS project of the National Maritime Research Institute, Japan, focusing on the development of CO2 injection method is presented.

TI  - Planning for offshore CO2 storage: Law and policy in the United Kingdom
AB  - `Offshore CO2 storage' refers to the injection of liquefied CO2 into deep geological formations beneath the seabed (e.g. depleted oil and gas reservoirs, and saline aquifers) for the purpose of storing it there on a permanent basis. The storage in this manner of captured CO2 emissions from industrial installations and power plants has attracted considerable scientific and technical interest as a potential mitigation response to climate change. A key issue facing policymakers in several countries is how to reconcile policy commitments to develop offshore CO2 storage with other competing - and potentially conflicting - uses of the marine environment. With a view to informing policy responses to this issue, this paper presents a case study of legal and policy frameworks concerning offshore CO2 storage in United Kingdom. The paper maps key design features of the United Kingdom's framework for marine permitting and planning, appraising the extent to which they enable orderly development of offshore CO2 storage in a manner consistent with relevant high-level policy objectives.

TI  - Studying the effect of CO2-induced acidification on sediment toxicity using acute amphipod toxicity test
AB  - Carbon capture and storage is increasingly being considered one of the most efficient approaches to mitigate the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere associated with anthropogenic emissions. However, the environmental effects of potential CO2 leaks remain largely unknown. The amphipod Ampelisca brevicornis was exposed to environmental sediments collected in different areas of the Gulf of CÃ¡diz and subjected to several pH treatments to study the effects of CO2-induced acidification on sediment toxicity. After 10 days of exposure, the results obtained indicated that high lethal effects were associated with the lowest pH treatments, except for the RÃ­a of Huelva sediment test. The mobility of metals from sediment to the overlying seawater was correlated to a pH decrease. The data obtained revealed that CO2-related acidification would lead to lethal effects on amphipods as well as the mobility of metals, which could increase sediment toxicity.

TI  - Carbon capture and storage in the UK and Germany: easier task, stronger commitment?
AB  - A successful carbon capture and storage (CCS) policy and programme is widely considered essential to curbing carbon dioxide emissions. What explains the strikingly different policy outcomes in two key European Union political heavyweights and coal economies, the UK and Germany? The UK has decided to contract two specific CCS projects, with explicit timelines for realisation; Germany has made no such decisions. From scrutiny of official documents and in-depth high-level interviews, it was found that the UK has more favourable structural capacity, including offshore storage capacity (which evokes less conflict) and significant oil-industry expertise, and thus an easier task. Moreover, this structural capacity has interacted with a solid political commitment to bring CCS forward in the UK, including specific, multistage funding and a high-level drive to develop CCS, especially after 2009. In Germany, by contrast, CCS has encountered increasing local and central opposition since 2009, with the Energiewende and renewables being accorded priority.

TI  - Controls on CO2 storage security in natural reservoirs and implications for CO2 storage site selection
AB  - For carbon capture and storage to successfully contribute to climate mitigation efforts, the captured and stored CO2 must be securely isolated from the atmosphere and oceans for a minimum of 10,000 years. As it is not possible to undertake experiments over such timescales, here we investigate natural occurrences of CO2, trapped for 10(4)-10(6) yr to understand the geologic controls on long term storage performance. We present the most comprehensive natural CO2 reservoir dataset compiled to date, containing 76 naturally occurring natural CO2 stores, located in a range of geological environments around the world. We use this dataset to perform a critical analysis of the controls on long-term CO2 retention in the subsurface. We find no evidence of measureable CO2 migration at 66 sites and hence use these sites as examples of secure CO2 retention over geological timescales. We find unequivocal evidence of CO2 migration to the Earth's surface at only 6 sites, with inconclusive evidence of migration at 4 reservoirs. Our analysis shows that successful CO2 retention is controlled by: thick and multiple caprocks, reservoir depths of >1200 m, and high density CO2. Where CO2 has migrated to surface, the pathways by which it has done so are focused along faults, illustrating that CO2 migration via faults is the biggest risk to secure storage. However, we also find that many naturally occurring CO2 reservoirs are fault bound illustrating that faults can also securely retain CO2 over geological timescales. Hence, we conclude that the sealing ability of fault or damage zones to CO2 must be fully characterised during the appraisal process to fully assess the risk of CO2 migration they pose. We propose new engineered storage site selection criteria informed directly from on our observations from naturally occurring CO2 reservoirs. These criteria are similar to, but more prescriptive than, existing best-practise guidance for selecting sites for engineered CO2 storage and we believe that if adopted will increase CO2 storage security in engineered CO2 stores.

TI  - Combination of Silica Gel and Surfactin Promoting Methane Hydrate Formation
AB  - Recently, gas hydrates based technologies have been exploited for few novel applications such as storage and transpiration of natural gas, gas mixtures separation, CO2 capture, and seawater desalination. Most of these applications are currently facing a challenge of low rate of gas hydrate formation. Chemical additives like surfactants can play a role of a good kinetic promoter for gas hydrate formation. The present study reports the application of biosurfactant for enhancing gas hydrate formation. Biosurfactant was produced by Bacillus subtilis strain A21. These types of microbes show their presence in the real gas hydrate sites also. The surfactin was characterized using many sophisticated techniques, conforming the formation of surfactin. It was used in the presence of fixed bed media of silica gel, and it was observed that surfactin in the presence of silica gel increased the consumption of moles of methane as well as reduced the induction time also as well as the conversion was also increased up to 27.9\% for 390 min for 1000 ppm surfactin hence indicating it to be a clean and novel promoter of methane hydrate formation in combination with silica gel which can replace its synthetic counterparts which have environmental concerns.

TI  - A low-carbon future for The North Sea Basin
AB  - Human emissions of greenhouse gases have caused a predictable rise of 1.2 degrees C in global temperatures. Over the last 70 years, the rise has occurred at a geologically unprecedented speed and scale. To avoid a worsening situation, most developed nations are turning to renewable sources of power to meet their climate commitments, including the UK, Norway, Denmark and The Netherlands. The North Sea basin offers many advantages in the transition from fossil fuels by virtue of its natural resources, physical setting, offshore infrastructure and skilled workforce. Nonetheless, the magnitude of the up-front costs and the scale required to achieve net zero emissions are rarely acknowledged. In addition, some of the technologies being planned are commercially immature. In particular, the current cost of the capture, transport and disposal of carbon dioxide is problematic as a large-scale solution to industrial emissions. Repurposing the North Sea to meet a low-carbon future will require substantial collaboration between governments and industrial sectors. There are nonetheless significant opportunities for companies prepared to switch from the traditional oil and gas business to renewable energy production and other sustainable activities.

TI  - CONSEQUENCE MODELING OF HYPOTHETICAL RELEASES FROM CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) TRANSPORT PIPELINES
AB  - Reducing carbon emissions is increasingly becoming a priority to combat climate change. Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is one of the primary approaches to help combat carbon emissions in the oil and gas and other industries. These technologies involve capturing the CO2 from combustion, refining, or other types of industrial activities, then transporting that CO2 to another location where it can be utilized or stored underground or below the sea floor. Pipelines are one of the primary transportation methods, and as more CCUS operations start to come online, more pipelines will be built or converted from transporting hydrocarbons to transporting CO2. Like most products transported by pipeline, there are risks associated with CO2 transport. However, these risks are quite different from those of hydrocarbon transport. CO2 is not flammable and is less toxic. The primary risk associated with a release of a large quantity of CO2 is the displacement of oxygen that can cause an asphyxiation hazard. Direct exposure to cooled CO2 liquid or gas can cause irritation or even frostbite. CO2 releases into water can harmfully alter the water pH level. Due to these risks, it is necessary for operators to understand the potential consequences of an accidental loss of containment. This paper will review an approach for consequence modeling used for the potential conversion of service from crude oil transport to CO2, for a confidential pipeline operator. This will include an overview of the modeling tools used, the inputs and assumptions incorporated, the range of hypothetical release scenarios considered (including full-bore ruptures and smaller leaks) and overview of the results. This assessment was used to answer a variety of questions asked to evaluate whether this conversion was a viable project. This included determining the potential impact area from a worst-case discharge, what receptors are at risk, and identifying optimal operational considerations (i.e. valve type and placement, leak detection requirements, etc.). This approach for consequence modeling for CO2 pipelines can be used to help ensure safety during the coming energy transition. Copyright Â© 2022 by ASME.

TI  - Environmental considerations for subseabed geological storage of CO2: A review
AB  - Many countries are now using or investigating offshore geological storage of CO2 as a means to reduce atmospheric CO2 emissions. Although associated research often focuses on deep-basin geology (e.g. seismic, geomagnetics), environmental data on the seabed and shallow subseabed is also crucial to (1) detect and characterise potential indicators of fluid seeps and their potential connectivity to targeted storage reserves, (2) obtain baseline environmental data for use in future monitoring, and (3) acquire information to facilitate an improved understanding of ecosystem processes for use in impact prediction. This study reviews the environmental considerations, including potential ecological impacts, associated with subseabed geological storage of CO2. Due to natural variations in CO2 levels in seafloor sediments, baseline CO2 measurements and knowledge of physical-chemical processes affecting the regional distribution of CO2 and pH are critical for the design of appropriate monitoring strategies to assess potential impacts of CO2 seepage from subseabed storage reservoirs. Surficial geological and geophysical information, such as that acquired from multibeam sonar and sub-bottom profiling, can be used to investigate the connectivity between the deep reservoirs and the surface, which is essential in establishing the reservoir containment properties. CO2 leakage can have a pronounced effect on sediments and rocks which in turn can have carryover effects to biogeochemical cycles. The effects of elevated CO2 on marine organisms are variable and species-specific but can also have cascading effects on communities and ecosystems, with marine benthic communities at some natural analogue sites (e.g. volcanic vents) showing decreased diversity, biomass, and trophic complexity. Despite their potential applications, environmental surveys and data are still not a standard and integral part of subseabed CO2 storage projects. However, the habitat mapping and seabed characterisation methodology that underpins such surveys is well developed and has a strong record of providing information to industry and decision makers. This review provides recommendations for an integrated and interdisciplinary approach to offshore geological storage of CO2, which will benefit national programs and industry and will be valuable to researchers in a broad range of disciplines.

TI  - Sorption-enhanced gasification of municipal solid waste for hydrogen production: a comparative techno-economic analysis using limestone, dolomite and doped limestone
AB  - Sorption-enhanced gasification has been shown as a viable low-carbon alternative to conventional gasification, as it enables simultaneous gasification with in-situ CO2 capture to enhance the production of H2. CaO-based sorbents have been a preferred choice due to their low cost and wide availability. This work assessed the technical and economic viability of sorption-enhanced gasification using natural limestone, doped limestone with seawater and dolomite. The techno-economic performance of the sorption-enhanced gasification using different sorbents was compared with that of conventional gasification. Regarding the thermodynamic performance, dolomite presented the worst performance (46.0% of H2 production efficiency), whereas doped limestone presented the highest H2 production efficiency (50.0%). The use of dolomite also resulted in the highest levelised cost of hydrogen (5.4 â‚¬/kg against 5.0 â‚¬/kg when limestone is used as sorbent), which translates into a CO2 avoided cost ranging between 114.9 â‚¬/tCO2 (natural limestone) and 130.4 â‚¬/tCO2 (dolomite). Although doped limestone has shown a CO2 avoided cost of 117.7 â‚¬/tCO2, this can be reduced if the production cost of doped limestone is lower than 42.6 â‚¬/t. The production costs of new sorbents for CO2 capture and H2 production need to be similar to that of natural limestone to become an attractive alternative to natural limestone.

TI  - Post-Combustion Carbon Capture and Storage in Industry
AB  - Post-combustion CO2 capture as a form of carbon capture and storage (CCS) is currently the most promising technology to reduce CO2 emissions from the conversion of fossil fuels. Currently, in the form of amine scrubbing, it exists at the commercial scale; a number of other CCS technologies also exist at the commercial or near-commercial scale, in the form of pre-combustion capture from gasification processes, oxy-fuel combustion for CO2 separation, and chemical and calcium looping. While the utility market is an evident focus of CCS technology, there are some doubts about whether or not this market will be largely dominated, in the next several decades, by renewable generation and the mass enrolment of energy storage devices, or if CCS technologies will be utilized to balance the supply-demand gap. However, there remain numerous opportunities in the industrial sector for CCS technology to contribute to reducing CO2 emissions. These opportunities include well-known industries such as cement and steel as well as sectors like marine transport. This chapter will evaluate the available technologies and focus on the many opportunities that now exist in the industrial sector for CCS.

TI  - Dynamic simulation and control of feed conditioning system for CO 2 capture
AB  - There are several CO 2 removal technologies currently applied in the commercial and production scale. One of the potential technologies currently being evaluated for offshore CO 2 separation is Centrifugal Fluid Separation technology, specifically Supersonic Gas Separation (SGS). It is potentially better than the conventional solutions such as membrane in terms of CAPEX, hydrocarbon losses, footprint, tonnage and power requirement. However, the stringent requirement of cryogenic temperature and high pressure of its feed requires a robust feed conditioning process plant. There are limited studies on the simulation and control design which are crucial to test the stability and dynamic responses of the feed conditioning plant. This paper investigates the optimal regulatory plant-wide control strategy for the feed conditioning plant subjected by various disturbances in temperature, pressure and feed CO 2 composition.

TI  - Conversion of CO2from the Energy Systems On-Board Ships via Catalytic Cycloaddition to Styrene Oxide: Modeling and Numerical Simulation
AB  - The conversion of CO2from the flue gas stream of marine engines on-board cargo ships via the catalytic cycloaddition to styrene oxide (SO) using fixed-bed reactors (FBRs) packed with silica-supported pyrrolidinopyridinium iodide (SSPI) catalyst was studied. The hydrodynamics and performance of these FBRs exposed to tilting and rolling/heaving motions were explored via a Eulerian 3D unsteady state model with the aim of understanding their behavior under changes in sea state. In the case of permanent inclination of selected (large-diameter) FBRs, the secondary flow of liquid in circumferential and radial directions generated by gravity-driven migration of liquid is less important compared to the flow in axial direction and causes axial symmetry breaking only in the wall regions of the reactor. The performance of CO2cycloaddition process increases slowly with inclination of FBR. CO2conversion oscillations under externally induced sinusoidal heave motion (SHM) (with amplitude up to 0.2g and period up to 20 s) or sinusoidal angular motion (SAM) (with amplitude up to 15 deg and period up to 40 s) are maintained around the conversion of vertical reactor (SHM) or are slightly offset upward compared to the conversion of vertical reactor (SAM). The results show a little impact of forced SAM and SHM on the hydrodynamics of large-diameter FBRs. The reactor proposed for the conversion of CO2into a value-added chemical (styrene carbonate) on-board a middle size cargo ship is much smaller than the offshore units suggested in the open literature for the capture of carbon via an absorption process.

TI  - Pre-combustion removal of carbon dioxide from natural gas power plants and the transition to hydrogen energy systems
AB  - A system to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from combustion power plants is described. Unlike earlier proposals based on flue gas treatment, the problem is addressed prior to combustion by reforming the hydrocarbon fuel into H2 and CO2. Following separation, H2 is burned in place of the original fuel and the captured CO2 is liquefied and injected into the deep ocean at a depth sufficient to ensure effective containment, and to minimize damage to the marine environment. Calculations indicate moderate plant thermal efficiency and power cost penalties. In addition, the H2 production potential of this system may be exploited as a means to facilitate the transition from fossil fuels to future hydrogen energy systems. Â© 1992 by ASME.

This is the only technology currently available that allows continued use of fossil fuels while simultaneously reducing emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere. Although the subsurface injection and subsequent migration of large amounts of CO2 involve a number of challenges, many decades of research in the earth sciences, focused on fluid movement in porous rocks, provides a strong foundation on which to analyze the system. These analyses indicate that environmental risks associated with large CO2 injections appear to be manageable.

TI  - Rethinking appraisal: Identification of pre- and post-sanction uncertainty drivers in deep and ultra deep Gulf of Mexico fields using data mining and data analytics
AB  - Appraisal is a key step in consenting to develop an asset, or abandoning it, and is pursued after successful drilling of an exploration well in a potential field. During the appraisal process the drainage area and original hydrocarbons in place, as well as ultimate recovery (EUR) from the field are estimated which are often based on minimum set of information gathered during the exploration phase. This lack of data, along with uncertainties surrounding the appraisal data, introduces high degrees of variations in pre- and post-sanction EURs (EUR). These estimates, however, are revisited each time new data becomes available and as a result, the EUR from a field, along with several other factors, is subject to change over the field lifespan. Identifying the key drivers in accurate pre-sanction estimation of ultimate recovery and reducing post sanction EUR variance, helps in resource allocation and sustainable field development. A major hurdle faced in subsurface characterization of assets is the degree of dependency between attributes and, the often non-linear behavior of these attributes. One way of overcoming these limitations is regression analysis; however, even in a high accuracy fit, regression coefficients by themselves are not necessarily good measures for ranking attributes, and elimination of lower ranked attributes would result in a new ranking of the remaining attributes. In the present study, several data mining techniques are applied on a dataset of 152 deep and ultra-deep water (D&UDW) fields in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) to determine which of the 77 well-, reservoir- and field-scale attributes best capture the EUR variance for different fluid types in D&UDW fields in the GoM. Unlike the conventional regression approaches, the present study offers a robust and stable ranking of attributes with high accuracy fit, where low to none contributing (poorly-predictive) attributes can be safely removed without changing the overall ranking of higher attributes. This ensures that a high ranked attribute is indeed a major contributor to accurate estimation of the ultimate recovery from a field, and therefore is worth the investment for capturing its value; on the other hand, a low ranked attribute, in all likelihood, is a redundant attribute and should not be collected; this would in turn free up resources that can be allocated to acquisition of high(er) ranking attributes.

TI  - Navigating the ``paradox of openness{''} in energy and transport innovation: Insights from eight corporate clean technology research and development case studies
AB  - Using an inductive case study approach drawn from original interview data, this article investigates the innovation approaches among a sample of international energy companies, or corporate firms. It first presents a conceptual framework synthesized from the business studies, entrepreneurship, evolutionary economics, innovation studies, management science, organization studies, political science, and sociology literature. This framework suggests that corporate approaches to clean technology innovation will cut across the four dimensions of organizational multiplicity and stakeholder involvement, information sharing, coordination and control, and market orientation. It then explores how eight firms the Algal Carbon Conversion Flagship and Aurora Algae (biofuel), DONG and Statoil (carbon capture and storage), Tesla and Volkswagen (electric vehicles), and Siemens and Vestas (offshore wind turbines) approach clean technology development with ``open innovation{''} attributes mixed with ``closed{''} attributes. Although the study finds striking similarities among the particular approaches embraced by each corporate actor, it also notes that approaches are technology and firm specific, and the potential for different permutations leads to an almost endless number of possible stylistic combinations. The innovation profiles depicted also reveal conflict and competition among various stakeholders, the implication being that corporate innovation in the energy sector remains a conflicted, disjointed, and messy process.

TI  - Why massive nuclear deployment is essential
AB  - Avoiding CO2 emissions while meeting global energy needs is a far greater challenge than most commentators and governments appreciate. Even the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has offered no scenario that would stabilize atmospheric levels. The capacity of the oceans to absorb CO 2 is limited to about 40% of the level of emissions in 1990. Shared equitably among the present-day world population, per capita emissions of 35% of the current European average would only return the world to 100% of 1990 emission levels. Yet world population will probably grow by 25% by 2050 and, between 1990 and 2007, global emissions increased by 29%. Our current global trajectory is hurtling us toward ever-higher levels, perhaps even disaster. Consequently, near-zero-emitting sources are the only approaches to energy generation that should be deployed. Nuclear power, with its immense energy density, is the only available source that qualifies for widespread deployment. Existing alternative options are not and cannot effectively contribute (see e.g. MacKay, 20081). The weakness in wind is the need for back-up and supplementation, not so much from its short-term fickleness but its seasonal variability. Carbon capture and storage would have to achieve far higher levels of capture than currently seem feasible. Hydroelectricity has limited remaining potential as well as needing careful deployment to avoid collateral emissions. Aggressive conservation and efficiency measures reduce but do not solve the growth in energy demand and usage. Global economic downturns provide temporary relief but huge social political pain, and energy supply security concerns remain unresolved issue for many countries, even today. Of course nuclear alone would face an overwhelming challenge. We shall need to deploy massive improvements in the efficiency with which energy is used. Solar power in various forms has promise and could have a substantial role at lower latitudes in consistently sunny areas though photovoltaic electricity is still a high-cost option. Geothermal and various forms of ocean-derived energy have development potential. However, we argue that worldwide deployment of 5000 to 10 000 nuclear reactors by 2050 is the only clearly accessible pathway to CO2 stabilization that exists today. This will require extension of the resource beyond once-through cycles and so the deployment of advanced reactor types. But it is doable, it is affordable, and our planet must plan to accomplish this deployment. Copyright Â© 2009 by ASME.

TI  - Hybrid and composite risers for deep waters and aggressive reservoirs
AB  - This paper outlines the main benefits of composite and hybrid flexible risers in deep water applications and describes the main challenges in qualifying such riser solutions for safety and reliability. The most prominent new riser concepts that utilize modern composite materials for strength, weight reduction and corrosion resistance are briefly introduced. They use pultruded carbon fibre composite rods as tensile strength elements or thermoplastic composite pipes (TCPs) as the complete riser section or as a layer in an unbonded flexible riser wall. These concepts provide the bending flexibility required for efficient installation and accommodation of movement of the floating offshore unit. The bending flexibility is achieved by accommodating relative movements between elements of the unbonded layers in the pipe wall and by the inherent flexibility of the TCP. The shortcomings of current design practices for application to hybrid and composite risers are identified. Industry addresses these challenges by using modern design formats and structural reliability methods as well as best industry practice for qualification of new technology. The main qualification challenges are summarized, and recommendations are provided for how to address them. Work is in progress to capture the current state of the art in new tailor-made standards to simplify the safe and responsible exploitation of the new hybrid and composite riser technologies in offshore oil and gas field developments without needing to resort to structural reliability analysis and technology qualification.

TI  - Phosphorus behavior in sediments during a sub-seabed CO2 controlled release experiment
AB  - The CO2 controlled release experiment ``Quantifying and Monitoring Potential Ecosystem Impacts of Geological Carbon Storage{''} (QICS) assessed the impacts of potential CO2 leakage from sub-seabed carbon capture and storage reservoirs to the marine environment. During QICS, CO2 gas was released into shallow sediment in Ardmucknish Bay, Scotland, in the spring and summer of 2012. As part of this project, we investigated the effects of CO2 leakage on sedimentary phosphorus (P), an essential nutrient for marine productivity. We found no statistically significant effects during QICS, as the solid-phase P content in the sediment was constant before, during, and after exposure to CO2. However, laboratory experiments using marine sediment standard materials as well as QICS sediment revealed substantial differences among these different sediment types in their potential for P release during CO2 exposure. Employing the SEDEX sequential extraction technique to determine the sizes of the major P pools in the sediments, we showed that calcium-bound P can be easily released by CO2 exposure, whereas iron-bound P is a major sink of released P. The overall impacts of CO2 leakage on sediment P behavior appear to be low compared to natural variability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Oxygen production technologies for IGCC power plants with CO2 capture
AB  - IGCC power plants seem to represent one of the most appealing options to produce electric energy from coal and low grade solid fuels with interesting plant efficiency and low environmental impact. As a matter of fact the majority of gasification-based power plants are equipped with oxygen-blown gasifiers which have two main advantages with respect to air-blown reactors: high values of cold gas efficiency and an N2 deprived syngas. The aim of this paper is to compare two different oxygen production technologies for oxidant supply to the gasification island. An IGCC power plant with pre-combustion CO2 capture has been modelled considering: (i) a cryogenic distillation ASU based on a pumped liquid oxygen cycle; (ii) an innovative OTM-based oxygen production technology integrated in the power island. An overall heat and material balance has been estimated to evaluate plant performances and compare the two options; our thermodynamic analysis shows a promising improvement of the overall plant performance for the OTM-based IGCC nonetheless several key issues deserve a more in depth analysis to asses the real potentialities of membrane-based oxygen production technology.

TI  - Ranking and risking alternative CO2 storage sites offshore Norway
AB  - As a part of the Norwegian Government plan to develop a new full-scale CCS project, several industrial players were engaged to conduct feasibility studies on CO2 capture, transport and storage during 2016. This paper summarizes the storage site evaluation study. The overall concept is to capture CO2 from several industrial sources in the Oslo area and transport via ship to offshore storage on the Norwegian continental shelf. The design capacity requirement was to handle 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 per year over a period of 25 years. Three storage site were investigated: the Heimdal gas field, and two new sites named Smeaheia and Utsira South. All three sites were found to be technically feasible from a geological and reservoir engineering perspective. However, the Utsira site had insufficient capacity due to well-leakage risk and limited available area for storage licencing. Use of the depleted Heimdal gas field was found to be technically feasible but less attractive due to costs and operational issues at the site. In contrast, the Smeaheia site offered both operational and geological flexibility leading to its eventual selection for further maturation as a new offshore CO2 storage site in Norway.

TI  - Simulated leakage of high pCO(2) water negatively impacts bivalve dominated infaunal communities from the Western Baltic Sea
AB  - Carbon capture and storage is promoted as a mitigation method counteracting the increase of atmospheric CO2 levels. However, at this stage, environmental consequences of potential CO2 leakage from sub-seabed storage sites are still largely unknown. In a 3-month-long mesocosm experiment, this study assessed the impact of elevated pCO(2) levels (1,500 to 24,400 mu atm) on Cerastoderma edule dominated benthic communities from the Baltic Sea. Mortality of C. edule was significantly increased in the highest treatment (24,400 mu atm) and exceeded 50\%. Furthermore, mortality of small size classes (0-1 cm) was significantly increased in treatment levels >= 6,600 mu atm. First signs of external shell dissolution became visible at >= 1,500 mu atm, holes were observed at > 6,600 mu atm. C. edule body condition decreased significantly at all treatment levels (1,500-24,400 mu atm). Dominant meiofauna taxa remained unaffected in abundance. Densities of calcifying meiofauna taxa (i.e. Gastropoda and Ostracoda) decreased in high CO2 treatments (> 6,600 mu atm), while the non - calcifying Gastrotricha significantly increased in abundance at 24,400 mu atm. In addition, microbial community composition was altered at the highest pCO(2) level. We conclude that strong CO2 leakage can alter benthic infauna community composition at multiple trophic levels, likely due to high mortality of the dominant macrofauna species C. edule.

AB  - Shell's Peterhead carbon capture and storage (CCS) project, at Peterhead Power Station, Aberdeenshire on the northeast coast of Scotland, is competing to become the world's first gas fired power station to integrate CCS on a commercial scale. Post-comustion amine-based capture technology will be retrofitted to one of the three turbines at Peterhead Power Station, diverting the flue gases and preventing around 90% of the turbine's emitted CO2 from entering the atmosphere. Shell owns the Cansolv absorption technology, by which feed gas is first quenched and saturated in a circulated water pre-scrubber. The gas then contacts a lean amine solution in a counter-current mass transfer-packed absorption column.

TI  - At what pressure shall co2 be transported by ship? An inâ€depth cost comparison of 7 and 15 barg shipping
AB  - The pipeline has historically been the preferred means to transport CO2 due to its low cost for short distances and opportunities for economies of scale. However, interest in vesselâ€based transport of CO2 is growing. While most of the literature has assumed that CO2 shipping would take place at low pressure (at 7 barg and âˆ’46 Â°C), the issue of identifying best transport conditions, in terms of pressure, temperature, and gas composition, is becoming more relevant as shipâ€based carbon capture and storage chains move towards implementation. This study focuses on an inâ€depth comparison of the two primary and relevant transport pressures, 7 and 15 barg, for annual volumes up to 20 MtCO2/year and transport distances up to 2000 km. We also address the impact of a number of key factors on optimal transport conditions, including (a) transport between harbours versus transport to an offshore site, (b) CO2 pressure prior to conditioning, (c) the presence of impurities and of purity constraints, and (d) maximum feasible ship capacities for the 7 and 15 barg options. Overall, we have found that 7 barg shipping is the most costâ€efficient option for the combinations of distance and annual volume where transport by ship is the costâ€optimal means of transport. Fur-thermore, 7 barg shipping can enable significant cost reductions (beyond 30%) compared to 15 barg shipping for a wide range of annual volume capacities. Â© 2021 by the authors.

TI  - New hydrate Anti-agglomerant formulation for offshore flow assurance and oil capture
AB  - Gas hydrate formation often blocks flowlines in oil and gas production due to low temperature and high pressure, and may result in serious safety and environmental problems. Risk management of gas hydrate is a major challenge in offshore hydrocarbon production. Anti-agglomerantion (AA) is an attractive option because of effectiveness at low dosage and high subcooling. Hydrate particles are kept small and allow flow in slurry form, therefore avoiding plugging in flowlines. Until recently various authors have believed that anti-agglomeration is based on the formation of water-in-oil emulsion. We have demonstrated that the process can occur without emulsion or through oil-in-water emulsion. We have shown anti-agglomeration in methane and in one natural gas system. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness in two natural gases and in a crude oil system. In the crude oil, the effectiveness is shown in both water and in brine. These demonstrations pave the way for vast potential applications in both offshore flowlines and in oil capture from the seabed. Copyright Â© 2014, Offshore Technology Conference.

Three-dimensional (3D) seismic has been shown to be an effective technology for visualizing and measuring subsurface geology and fluids. In this study, we demonstrate the successful acquisition, processing and initial interpretation of a high-resolution 3D (HR3D) seismic survey in Tomakomai, offshore Japan, above an active offshore CO2 injection site.

TI  - Kaombo start-up strategy: Together we Throve!
AB  - The FPSO Kaombo Norte came on stream on July 27th offshore Angola. When both its FPSOs will be at plateau, Kaombo, the biggest deep offshore project in Angola will account for 15% of the country's oil production. It produces light oil from six fields scattered over an 800-square-kilometer area. Gindungo, Gengibre, and Caril fields are connected to the Norte FPSO while Mostarda, Canela, and Louro fields will be producing on FPSO Sul. The full development stands out for its subsea network size with more than 300 kilometers of lines on the seabed within 1500-2000m water depth, including subsea production wells more than 25km away from the production facility. In order to secure a safe First-Oil and to smoothly start-up the production, a detailed and cross-functional study was carried out. The first step was to start from a clean slate by forgetting all previous startup scenarios: the three loops candidate to start-up hydrocarbon production were re-analyzed in depth to evaluate strengths and weaknesses. A task force composed of all involved disciplines, including contractors, was put in place in order to apply a cross-functional approach. Constraints from reservoir up to topsides were analyzed providing an overall picture and clear ranking to develop the start-up strategy. An ambitious planning of the commissioning activities combined with a relatively short-term reservoir management were crucial to lock production loop priorities with water injection and gas export systems readiness. The work jointly performed contributed to serene environment for a safe start-up and ramp-up. Following the assessment, decision was made to start first the most "powerful" reservoir despite a challenging flowline. The relatively high initial pressure and oil undersaturation, the robust open-hole gravel-pack completions and high productivity wells were beneficial to stabilize the multiphase flow in the subsea network. Improvement of the production was rapidly made with the start-up of the second production loop only fifteen days after. Postponement of the water injection system and the availability of the riser base gas lift were judiciously calculated: the readiness of these systems arrived in due time to respectively slow down the natural depletion of the reservoirs and improve the wells eruptivity and stability of the flowlines. Our capacity to re-invent ourselves and leave behind individual priorities conducted to a collective success captured in the outstanding production levels since early days of field life.

TI  - Impact of Uncertainties on the Design and Cost of CCS From a Waste-to-Energy Plant
AB  - Uncertainties are an inherent and important element of novel systems with limited large-scale industrial experience and must be taken into account in order to enable the design of cost-efficient energy systems. This paper investigates the optimal design of carbon capture and storage from a waste-to-energy plant under uncertainties. With the aim of providing a better understanding of the impact of uncertainties on the design and cost of CCS chains, as well as the capture technology selection, the case of a hypothetical 40 MW waste-to-energy plant located in Norway is considered. The impact of key technical and cost uncertainties on the cost of different CO2 capture and CCS chain options are investigated using an in-house techno-economic CCS assessment tool combined with an uncertainty quantification framework. When the different capture options are compared on a deterministic basis, the advanced amine yields the best performances (CO2 avoidance cost of 153 euro/tCO(2), avoided), followed by the membrane process based on partial capture (200 euro/tCO(2), avoided) and MEA-based capture (217 euro/tCO(2), avoided). However, in contrast with the advanced amine, the partial capture considered in the membrane process does not enable net negative CO2 emissions. Once technical and cost uncertainties are taken into account, the advanced amine-based capture remains the best option, however the MEA-based capture outperform the membrane process. Finally, the stochastic optimization showed that the uncertainties considered do not impact the optimal capture capacity in this case. The full CCS chain perspective is then included through two chain options: a nearby offshore saline aquifer or an offshore CO2 EOR storage located further away. The EOR-based chain leads to the best performances (187 vs. 202 euro/tCO(2), avoided) both on a deterministic basis and when different uncertainty scenarios are considered. However, as a shared transport and storage infrastructure is considered, uncertainty regarding the amount of CO2 coming from nearby industries leads to a different optimal design of the chain (pipeline diameter and ship capacity). Finally, uncertainties on the EOR response to CO2 injection can significantly reduce the potential of the CO2 EOR-based chain and lead to cases in which the saline aquifer-based chain would be optimal.

TI  - Off-shore PV and wind based energy generation
AB  - The development of oil drilling production leads to the research of standalone power plants located nearby to exclude the transportation of fuel for oil platforms. The present paper demonstrates opportunities in off-shore energy generation on the basis of photovoltaic (PV) panels using the existing infrastructure as a base. The proposed approach can be used to partly or generally consume energy for oil production from renewable energy sources with off-shore localization which may significantly reduce the cost of the oil based products in the near future. This is the first step to the big PV-based energy generation off-shore facilities. For more or less stable oil drilling facilities the offshore wind farms are considered. Â© 2019 IEEE.

TI  - Low-emission offshore Gas-To-Wire from natural gas with carbon dioxide: Supersonic separator conditioning and post-combustion decarbonation
AB  - Gas-To-Wire is a solution for remote offshore oil-gas fields with high gas-oil ratio and high carbon dioxide content, as it requires minimum natural gas upgrade and is feasible for long-distance transportation. Additionally, combining offshore Gas-To-Wire with carbon capture enables abatement of emissions while providing revenues from enhanced oil recovery. This work investigated offshore Gas-To-Wire comprising processing of natural gas with high carbon dioxide content, power generation, post-combustion carbon capture and enhanced oil recovery. Supersonic separator is proposed for three applications: fuel-gas conditioning, fuel-gas decarbonation and pioneering dehydration of supercritical carbon dioxide. Economic analysis, including offshore rig and electricity transmission, results in positive Net Present Value with 20% of return-on-investment, besides a Levelized Cost of Energy comparable to onshore power plants with carbon capture and storage. Sensitivity analysis shows high impact of electricity-price and oil recovery yield on profitability, as well as better economic performance when carbon dioxide is not removed from fuel-gas; i.e., all carbon capture should be post-combustion capture. Thus, despite effectiveness of supersonic separator for fuel-gas decarbonation, the 612 MW optimized Gas-To-Wire with carbon capture plant should have 100% of carbon removal via post-combustion, resulting in 38.3% return-on-investment and even better Levelized Cost of Energy similar to onshore power plants without carbon capture.

TI  - Study of geological storage for a candidate CCS demonstration Project in Tomakomai, Hokkaido, Japan
AB  - The Prime Minister of Japan declared: Japan should positively commit itself to setting a long-term reduction target. For its mid-term goal, Japan will aim to reduce its emissions by 25% by 2020, if compared to the 1990 level, consistent with what the science calls for in order to halt global warming. In order to achieve this target, the government considers CCS (Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage) as an essential method and aims to improve CCS technology to practical levels. Japan CCS Co., Ltd. (JCCS) was established in May, 2008 in order to study the potential and feasibility of CCS demonstration projects in Japan. The company was commissioned by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) in Japan. Major shareholders of JCCS include electric power companies, upstream to downstream petroleum companies, material companies, engineering companies, etc.. In 2008, an investigation of candidate sites for the CCS demonstration was done over Japan and several promising offshore sites were selected. One of the selected candidate sites is the Tomakomai offshore site in Hokkaido prefecture, located in the northern part of Japan where there are petroleum refineries, paper mills and power plants close to the site. The Yufutsu oil and gas field is located in the eastern part of Tomakomai city where much geological data has been obtained through oil and gas exploration. Basic geological modes were constructed and CO2 reservoir simulation was performed to predict the movement of the stored CO2. Simulation results show us that a sufficient volume of CO2 could be safely stored in the saline aquifers at the Tomakomai site for a demonstration period and afterward. From October to November in 2009, a 3D seismic survey was implemented to confirm the geological potential of the site. Ocean bottom cables enabled us to survey in front of the Tomakomai Port. The survey area (full-stacked area) was 3.0 km (N-S) by 2.7 km (W-E) and about 2 km from the shoreline with several target formations at a depth of about 1,100âˆ¼3,000 m. This survey was conducted in 4 patches using 2 to 3 sets of ocean bottom cables with the total number of receiver and shot lines being 10 and 26, respectively. Results of this survey were utilized in building the detailed 3D geological model for the CO2 reservoir simulation. Basic plant designing to capture CO2 at the hydrogen process in the petroleum refineries is currently ongoing. The captured CO2 will be injected at 250,000 ton/year for 4-5 years in the demonstration project. Many local organizations, such as the Tomakomai city government and the fisheries cooperative, cooperated to carry out the 3D seismic survey. The Tomakomai government has been strongly willing to invite the CCS demonstration project to the city. By their continuous cooperation is possible to carry forward the feasibility study in order to start the CO2 injection in 3-4 years. Â© 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - CO2 Transport Strategy for the Offshore CCS in Korea
AB  - Republic of Korea is the seventh largest CO2 emission country in 2010 and the third fastest country in the growth of CO2 emission according to the European Commission's Joint Research Center. To mitigate the effect of CO2 on the climate change and global warming, Korea should reduce the anthropogenic CO2 emissions from sources such as the power plants and iron works. So carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technology is regarded as one of the most promising reduction options. This study established the CO2 transport strategies from the sources to sinks (such as the saline aquifers and gas fields in the Southeast Sea of the Korean Peninsula) for the offshore CCS in Korea. Also the cost estimations were carried out with the CO2 transport strategies. The CO2 transport methods suggested in this study were pipelines for both onshore and offshore, and a complex concept consisting of a pipeline for the source to coast (including the liquefaction facility on a barge) and a CO2 carrier for the coast to sink (including the temporary storage near offshore sink). With respect to the onshore pipelines, it was desirable to construct the CO2 transport pipelines along existing roads and/or LNG (liquefied natural gas) pipelines, as already realized in the United Kingdom (UK) and the Australia CO2 transport chains because of the cost and environmental aspects. The CO2 carrier was considered for the offshore CCS demonstration stage starting in 2016 to meet the timeline set by the Korea National CCS Master Plan. To optimize the CO2 transport systems, the advantages and drawbacks for the CO2 transport using the pipeline and shipping were analysed and the costs for them were also estimated with the CO2 transport strategies. There were several factors to be considered before constructing the CO2 pipelines including the amount of CO2, the terrain, the diameter of pipe, the transport pressure, the CO2 quality, the transport temperature, the CO2 state (i.e. gas, liquid or supercritical phases), etc. Also for the CO2 shipping it should be considered such as the amount of CO2, the shape and capacity of CO2 cargo tanks, the ship capacity, the liquefaction pressure and temperature, the type of the temporary storage, etc. Although the present study is now on-going to optimize the CO2 transport infrastructure for the offshore CCS in Korea, the preliminary results show the CO2 transport cost for the pipeline system is lower than that for the shipping in the present status.

TI  - What have we learned about CO2 leakage from field injection tests?
AB  - Legislation and guidelines developed for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) have set performance requirements to minimize leakage risk, and to quantify and remediate any leaks that arise. For compliance it is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of the possible spread, fate and impacts of any leaked CO2, and also the ability to detect and quantify any leakage. Over the past decade, a number of field scale CO2 release experiments have been conducted around the world to address many of the uncertainties regarding the characteristics of near-surface expression of CO2 in terms of the impact and quantitation of CO2 leaks. In these experiments, either free phase or dissolved CO2 is injected and released into the shallow subsurface so as to artificially simulate a CO2 leak into the near-surface environment. The experiments differ in a number of ways, from the geological conditions, surface environments, injection rates and experimental set-up-including the injection and monitoring strategy. These experiments have provided abundant information to aid in the development of our scientific understanding of environmental impacts of CO2 while assessing state of the art monitoring techniques. We have collated a global dataset of field-scale shallow controlled release experiments that have released CO2 at depths shallower than 25 m. The dataset includes 14 different field experiment locations, of which nine intended to release CO2 to surface, and the remaining sites intended for CO2 to remain in the shallow subsurface. Several release experiments have been conducted at half of these sites, and so in total, 42 different CO2 release tests have taken place at the 14 sites we examine. These experiments and their results are scrutinised to establish: (i) the range of experimental approaches and environments explored to date (such as the environment, subsurface conditions, injection strategy and whether gaseous or dissolved CO2 were injected and in what quantities); (ii) the range of CO2 injection and surface release rates at these experiments; (iii) the collective learnings about the surface and subsurface manifestation of the CO2 release, the spread and fate of the CO2, rates of CO2 flux to surface, and methods of measuring these; (iv) how successfully current approaches can detect and quantify CO2. This allows us to highlight where uncertainties remain and identify knowledge gaps that future experiments should seek to address. We also draw on the collective experiences to identify common issues or complications, and so recommend best practice' guidelines for experiment design and reporting at future CO2 release experiments.(C) 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Injecting carbon dioxide to boost oil and gas recovery is both environment-friendly and financially viable. Mature oil and gas fields in the North sea have huge potential for carbon storage. However, only few facilities exist for capturing, transporting and storing carbon dioxide. Thus, Shell and Statoil's plan of building gas-fired power station with carbon dioxide capture at the Tjeldbergodden industrial complex is a welcome relief to the current situation.

TI  - Local acceptance and communication as crucial elements for realizing CCS in the Nordic region
AB  - The purpose of this paper was to assess the Nordic situation with regard to carbon capture and storage (CCS) deployment at the local level. This was done by identifying important factors found in the literature on community acceptance and communication and relating this to possible CCS deployment in the Skagerrak region. The analysis was complemented with findings from interviews made with municipalities in the three countries (Denmark, Sweden and Norway). The results show that the possibilities to store CO2 offshore may be a clear advantage for the Nordic region and that Porsgrunn municipality in Norway display very positive attitudes towards existing and potential CCS activities, which stands in contrast to the many public acceptance challenges experienced in Europe. Moreover, the municipalities display very different awareness about CCS, which is seen in relation to CCS experiences and national policies. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Sea of green
AB  - Imperial College spin-out Process Systems Enterprise (PSE) is joining forces with maritime classification society Det Norske Veritas (DNV) to develop systems for on-ship carbon capture and storage (CCS). PSE specializes in the simulations of chemical-industry processes and logistics to optimize and fine- tune the variables to maximize profitability. Among the factors to be considered are the tight constraints of space on board ships; the fact that ships are constantly moving while they emit CO 2; the need to maximize energy efficiency; and the safety requirements of modern shipping. There is no need for pressurized tanks and no risk of the release of the gas. This makes the chemical option attractive for shipboard application. The reactions are, however, reversible; CO2 can be released, usually by applying heat, and restoring the original absorbing material.

AB  - Researchers from Newcastle University, UK, have discovered that, in the presence of a Ni catalyst, CO2 can be rapidly and cheaply converted into solid carbonate salts. The discovery could lead to a simpler and less-expensive alternative for carbon capture and storage. The researchers were investigating the detailed mechanism of the carbonic acid reaction, as well as how organisms - particularly the sea urchin - absorb CO2 into their skeletons. Analysis of the surface of the sea urchin larvae revealed a high concentration of nickel on their exoskeleton. Nanoparticles of Ni were added to the carbonic acid test and complete removal of CO2 was observed. The group is now optimizing the mineralization reaction.

TI  - Low-carbon GeoEnergy resource options in the Midland Valley of Scotland, UK
AB  - Scotland is committed to be a carbon-neutral society by 2040 and has achieved the important initial step of decarbonizing power production. However, more ambitious measures are required to fully decarbonize all of the electricity, transport and heating sectors. We explore the potential to use low-carbon GeoEnergy resources and bioenergy combined with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) in the Midland Valley area to decarbonize the Scottish economy and society. The Midland Valley has a long history of geological resource extraction and, as a result, the geology of the region is well characterized. Geothermal energy and subsurface energy storage have the potential to be implemented. Some of them, such as gravity and heat storage, could re-use the redundant mining infrastructure to decrease investment costs. Hydrogen storage could be of particular interest as the Midland Valley offers the required caprock-reservoir assemblages. BECCS is also a promising option to reduce overall CO2 emissions by between 1.10 and 4.40 MtCO(2) a(-1). The Midland Valley has enough space to grow the necessary crops, but CO2 storage will most likely be implemented in North Sea saline aquifers. The studied aspects suggest that the Midland Valley represents a viable option in Scotland for the exploitation of the majority of low-carbon GeoEnergy resources.

TI  - Analysis: Wind power bodymakes waves
AB  - British Wind Energy Association was in the South West to mark the start of a long campaign to champion the emerging wave and tidal power sector, after 25 yr helping to bring wind farms to the UK countryside. Based on comparable European installations, the investment needed to reach the UK government's 10% target of electric power by 2010 is likely to be Â£20-23 billion. With regard to lifecycle terms, wind generators to not reduce the CO2 to any significant degree when the emissions from the complete power supply system are considered. The government is advised to work on other technological means, e.g., CO2 capture with storage and fuel cell application, to promote improvements in energy efficiency and encourage robust methods of saving energy with guaranteed CO2 reduction. However, years of distortion and non-market aligned subsidies have severely curtailed the country's renewable potential.

TI  - Indirect ocean capture of atmospheric CO2: Part II. Understanding the cost of negative emissions
AB  - Negative emissions technologies (NETs), which result in the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere, will be necessary to limit global warming to 2 degrees C. Unlike point-source CO2 capture, NETs are agnostic to the emission source, and reduce the existing atmospheric CO2 concentration. This enables NETs to address distributed emissions from transportation and past emissions that have led to existing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Despite their critical necessity, there are relatively few NETs that have been developed, and existing technologies do not have sufficiently detailed techno-economic analyses to allow comparison for the purpose of strategic investment and policy decisions. An analysis was performed of the economic feasibility of a novel platform of candidate NETs - indirect ocean capture (IOC) - through industry-validated economic and chemical process modeling supported by inputs from a prototype system. This manuscript details the development of a high-fidelity estimate of the cost of avoided CO2 emissions from this NET by coupling scaled experiments to economic analyses. For the lowest-cost scenario of co-location with a desalination plant, a likely cost of \$604 per metric ton of avoided CO2 (tCO(2)) was found, and a best-case cost of \$373/tCO(2). Through improvements to unit processes, creative process optimization, and reduced carbon-neutral electricity prices, the cost of IOC negative emissions may be reduced in the future. Although NETs won't likely require deployment for several years in order to limit warming to 2 degrees C, an objective techno-economic assessment of the options on the table will ensure that the best technology is developed and ready when deployment is required.

TI  - Extensive CO2 emissions from shallow coastal waters during passage of Hurricane Irene (August 2011) over the Mid-Atlantic Coast of the U.S.A.
AB  - Shallow coastal waters serve an important role as long-term carbon (C) sinks because they capture terrestrial C and retain internally produced C in wetlands and sediments. We show that tropical cyclones (TCs) can lead to rapid CO2 efflux from estuaries, driven by physical and biogeochemical perturbation of these coastal C reservoirs, and that the magnitude of TC-driven CO2 emissions may offset C that accumulates over much longer timescales. In August 2011, Hurricane Irene passed over North Carolina's Neuse River Estuary-Pamlico Sound (NRE-PS), which is part of the second largest estuarine system in the U.S., the Albemarle-Pamlico Sound. Irene rapidly changed the NRE-PS system from a small CO2 sink to a large CO2 source. Irene-induced CO2 efflux from the NRE alone was at least four times the annual riverine C input and seven times the annual atmospheric CO2 uptake. The magnitude and duration of ecosystem disturbance from TCs vary with storm intensity and frequency but likely are qualitatively similar across many terrestrial and coastal systems. Consequently, altered TC activity under future climate scenarios may shift the balance between C accumulation in, and release from, coastal C reservoirs.

TI  - CO2 EOR and storage - Lessons learned from several case studies
AB  - While CO2 EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) has been studied and used for several decades now the CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) applications are relatively new, yet actively expanding field of research. For both EOR and CCS processes an application to a given underground site requires an in-depth investigation and process optimization to achieve either optimal production or maximize storage capacity. A number of experimental and simulation studies performed in IRIS over a course of last years provided a deeper understanding of physical phenomena of CO2 transport. A number of issues related to handling various forces and scaling them up from core to field level were highlighted. While those investigations were performed for CO2 EOR projects the physical phenomena mentioned above are important for long-term storage. Diffusion, gravity and capillary forces would dominate shape and position of the CO2 plume during storage period in the absence of viscous forces (after injection shuts in). Several phenomena are addressed here: 1) CO2 dissolution in aqueous phase as carbon dioxide would migrate inside the storage site both as a free and dissolved phase; 2) diffusive transfer in the formation; 3) chemical interaction of carbon dioxide with reservoir rock as a way of changing rock properties; 4) dependence of relative permeabilities on miscibility development between oil and CO2; 5) dynamic reservoir behaviour during CO2 injection and pressure build-up may cause changes in flow properties of reservoir rock, fractures and faults, which determine well injectivity and may alter CO2 migration path and cause leak-off from the storage site. This manuscript presents case studies of the actual fields and analysis of laboratory experiments highlighting the phenomena described above. A sensitivity study of an actual naturally fractured reservoir in the North Sea is also presented. Finally conclusions on importance of correct handling of physical phenomena for reliable prediction of CO2 EOR or CCS processes are made.

TI  - Reduction of freshwater usage of a coal fired power plant with CCS by applying a high level of integration of all water streams
AB  - The integration of the recently built 1 070 MW coal-fired unit in Rotterdam (Netherlands) with the proposed new 250 MW demonstration carbon capture unit of the Rotterdam Opslag en Afvang Demonstratieproject (ROAD) would lead to a substantial reduction in freshwater usage. This is partly due to the power plant design, the most relevant features being the seawater direct cooling and the limestone gypsum Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD); and partly due to the high level of integration. This paper describes the water and waste streams of the capture plant, including quality and (re-) use in the power plant. The implications for a full scale capture are discussed.

TI  - Quantification of a subsea CO2 release with lab-on-chip sensors measuring benthic gradients
AB  - We present a novel approach to detecting and quantifying a subsea release of CO2 from within North Sea sediments, which mimicked a leak from a subsea CO2 reservoir. Autonomous lab-on-chip sensors performed in situ measurements of pH at two heights above the seafloor. During the 11 day experiment the rate of CO2 release was gradually increased. Whenever the currents carried the CO2-enriched water towards the sensors, the sensors measured a decrease in pH, with a strong vertical gradient within a metre of the seafloor. At the highest release rate, a decrease of over 0.6 pH units was observed 17 cm above the seafloor compared to background measurements. The sensor data was combined with hydrodynamic measurements to quantify the amount of CO2 escaping the sediments using an advective mass transport model. On average, we directly detected 43 +/- 8\% of the released CO2 in the water column. Accounting for the incomplete carbonate equilibration process increases this estimate to up to 61 +/- 10\%. This technique can provide long-term in situ monitoring of offshore CO2 reservoirs and hence provides a tool to support climate change mitigation activities. It could also be applied to characterising plumes and quantifying other natural or anthropogenic fluxes of dissolved solutes.

TI  - Combined FIV and VIV effects on a cantilevered pipe discharging fluid in deep waters
AB  - To avoid or mitigate global warming, several ocean carbon capture and storage concepts have been proposed. One of the recent approaches is to dispose carbon dioxide via a fixed vertical cantilevered pipe onto the seabed in deep waters. Due to a high aspect ratio and flexibility of such long pipe conveying fluid with fixed-free end conditions and external hydrodynamic loading caused by currents, the pipe may experience large-amplitude 3-D vibrations leading to structural failure. Hence, it is essential to understand and investigate the pipe nonlinear dynamic behaviors subject to combined flow-induced vibration (FIV) and vortex-induced vibration (VIV). In this study, the 3-D nonlinear equations of a cantilevered pipe discharging fluid in the sea are analyzed using a Galerkin-based multi modal approach combined with a finite difference Houbolt's integration scheme. Particular attention is paid to the combined effects of FIV and VIV on the dynamic response of the cantilevered pipe in water. To model the fluctuating lift and drag forces associated with VIV, the two dimensional wake oscillators distributed along the pipe are adopted. Numerical simulations in the FIV case of a pipe discharging fluid in the air are first validated with experimental results in the literature to justify the mathematical models and numerical approaches. Modal convergence analysis is also performed. Results in the combined FIV and VIV cases are then highlighted in order to show the effects of cross-flow and in-line VIV when compared with the pure FIV case. The effects of geometric nonlinearities, the coupling/interaction of multi modes and the space-time modifications of pipe responses and trajectories are highlighted. It is hoped that the numerical observations and findings obtained from this study could be verified by experimental studies which are presently lacking in the literature. Â© 2015 by ASME.

TI  - The use of leaching tests to assess metal release from contaminated marine sediment under CO2 leakages from CCS
AB  - This study provides a better knowledge of key parameters controlling the mobility of Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC), As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn from contaminated marine sediment in contact with acidified seawater using static and dynamic standard leaching tests. These procedures have been modified in order to use different leaching agents, L/S ratios, contact times and pH values that simulate seawater acidification under CO2 leakages scenarios. Studied sediment from a potential area of CO2 storage, shows a high acid neutralisation capacity (ANC(pH=4)=3.58 eq/kg) for deionised water as well as for seawater (ANC(pH=4)=3.97 eq/kg). The availability control mechanism is shown by releasing Cd with seawater at pH values 6, 7 and 8 and by the releasing of Zn with seawater at pH 6; the solubility control mechanism appears for Ni release using natural seawater. Experimental results of metal release from the pH dependence leaching test are modelled with Visual MINTEQ geochemical software to predict metal release from sediment, obtaining minor differences with experimental values. An improvement in the metal release results has been obtained considering in the model the influence of the DOC, Fe- and Al-(hydr)oxides, humic acids and fulvic acids. The obtained results would be useful as a line of evidence input for the risk assessment of a Carbon Capture and Storage site where acidified seawater at different concentrations of CO2 is in contact with sediment.

TI  - Energy mix for net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 in Japan An analysis considering siting constraints on variable renewable energy
AB  - This study investigated cost-effective energy strategies for realizing net zero CO2 emissions in Japan by 2050, employing an energy system optimization model with hourly electricity balances. The detailed temporal resolution enables the model to capture the intermittency of variable renewable energy (VRE) and the costs of system integration measures. Siting constraints on VRE, such as prohibiting solar PV and onshore wind developments in forests and offshore wind developments inside fishery rights areas, are incorporated in the model to reflect the environmental protection and social acceptance perspectives. Simulation results imply that a well-balanced power generation mix, combining renewables, nuclear, gas-fired with carbon capture and storage, as well as ammonia-fired, would contribute to curbing mitigation costs. In contrast, a simulation case with very high VRE penetration poses economic challenges. The average shadow price of electricity in 2050 in a 100\% renewables case (RE100) is projected to be more than doubled from a reference case which is based on middle-of-the-road assumptions. Marginal CO2 abatement cost in 2050 increases from 49,200 JPY/tCO(2) in the reference case to 75,300 JPY/tCO(2) in the RE100 case. The economic viability of high VRE penetration is improved by relaxing the siting constraints, although it may raise environmental and social concerns.

VGB-Kongress mit Fachausstellung]
AB  - The VGB congress of September 23-25, 2009 with the theme "addressing climate change - winning public acceptance through advanced technologies" takes place at Lyons. The congress is a significant meeting place of the European energy industry with renewed participation of many international participants. The meeting occurs near the pump storage power plant of Grand' Maison, 25 km east of Grenoble. The power plant, 1,685 m above sea level involves the dams of Grand' Maison and Verney. The output of the hydro power plant turbines is about 1.2 Gw and output of the pumps is up to 1.8 Gw. The first steam engines of about 300 yr ago converted about 0.5% of the energy input to usable work. Today modern thermal power plants exceed 50% electrical efficiency. With optimal use of the exhaust energy, up to 90% total use of the input energy is possible. In parallel to this, in recent decades power plants have contributed to clean air and noise initiatives and protection of the waters and ground, and being gentle on resources. In addition, development of the 700Â°C fossil power plant and technologies to separate carbon dioxide from flue gas and store it underground (carbon capture and storage, CCS), expansion of offshore wind energy, and expansion of energy reserves by continued use and expansion of nuclear power plants are going ahead. These efforts must be accompanied by winning public acceptance, which is the theme of this year's conference and exhibition. This year's site of the conference and exhibition is well chosen because France achieves two of the goals of energy policy, namely, climate protection and independence from energy imports. France generates about 80% of its electricity by nuclear energy and about 10% of its electricity by hydropower.

TI  - Workflows and considerations for CO2 injection in a highly depleted gas field in the southern North Sea
AB  - Issues and associated mitigation measures for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) relating to capacity, injectivity and integrity of the storage site are not trivial. Modeling of CO2 injection along wellbores is still in its infancy compared with traditional hydrocarbon modeling. While a significant amount of work has been done with respect to modeling discrete components of the storage site and associated infrastructure, validation of our modeling tools and the results still remains uncertain, particularly with respect to two phase flow in the wellbore. This paper presents a workflow for injection of CO 2 into highly depleted gas fields, addressing the issues around injection modeling and the impact on surface facilities, well design and the near wellbore interface. These include: obtaining accurate predictions of phase behavior, density, and viscosity, determining the impact of delivery pressure and temperature versus reservoir conditions. Wellbore design issues such as sizing and load resistance of tubulars and metallurgy selection in order to ensure both injection performance and integrity must also be considered. Modeling CO2 in the reservoir is also discussed considering the near wellbore effects (cooling and potential ice / hydrate formation). Finally, short and long term monitoring issues are identified and the benefits and limitations of the various monitoring options are discussed. Copyright 2011, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - Risk Assessment-Led Characterisation of the SiteChar UK North Sea Site for the Geological Storage of CO2
AB  - Risk assessment-led characterisation of a site for the geological storage of CO2 in the UK northern North Sea was performed for the EU SiteChar research project as one of a portfolio of sites. Implementation and testing of the SiteChar project site characterisation workflow has produced a `dry-run' storage permit application that is compliant with regulatory requirements. A site suitable for commercial-scale storage was characterised, compatible with current and future industrial carbon dioxide (CO2) sources in the northern UK. Pre-characterisation of the site, based on existing information acquired during hydrocarbon exploration and production, has been achieved from publicly available data. The project concept is to store captured CO2 at a rate of 5 Mt per year for 20 years in the Blake Oil Field and surrounding Captain Sandstone saline aquifer. This commercial-scale storage of 100 Mt CO2 can be achieved through a storage scenario combining injection of CO2 into the oil field and concurrent water production down-dip of the field. There would be no encroachment of supercritical phase CO2 for more than two kilometres beyond the field boundary and no adverse influence on operating hydrocarbon fields provided there is pressure management. Components of a storage permit application for the site are presented, developed as far as possible within a research project. Characterisation and technical investigations were guided by an initial assessment of perceived risks to the prospective site and a need to provide the information required for the storage permit application. The emphasis throughout was to reduce risks and uncertainty on the subsurface containment of stored CO2, particularly with respect to site technical performance, monitoring and regulatory issues, and effects on other resources. The results of selected risk assessment-led site characterisation investigations and the subsequent risk reassessments are described together with their implications for the understanding of the site. Additional investigations are identified that could further reduce risks and uncertainties, and enable progress toward a full storage permit application. Permit performance conditions are presented as SiteChar-recommended useful tools for discussion between the competent authority and operator.

TI  - A study of very large scale post combustion CO2 capture at a refining \& petrochemical complex
AB  - The CO2 Capture Project (CCP) is a joint project of eight major energy companies working to make significant reductions in the cost of capturing and storing CO2. The CCP is developing a range of technologies; post-combustion, oxyfuel and pre-combustion decarbonisation. To ensure realism, ``real world{''} scenarios, based on actual sites, have been established. One scenario is based upon the BP Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical complex located in the UK. This paper presents a study of the cost and practicability of capturing CO2 from the site using today's best available technology. The paper examines issues of retrofitting a very large scale, post combustion, amine based capture facility. It is designed to capture 2,000,000 tonnes per annum, of carbon dioxide which is compressed to 220 bar(a) for pipeline transmission to a North Sea oil field where it can be used for Enhanced Oil Recovery. Alternatively, it could also be stored in depleted reservoirs or deep saline formations. The study provides a firm basis for comparison with other technologies and develops a feasible process design and cost estimate. The paper discusses the environmental impacts, the benefits and the challenges to be addressed by anyone considering post combustion capture at this unprecedented scale.

TI  - Role of CO2 sequestration by country for global warming mitigation after 2013
AB  - This chapter evaluates CO2 sequestration technologies in parallel with other mitigation technologies and also in consideration of their regional differences. Five kinds of CO2 sequestration technologies are modeled: enhanced oil recovery, depleted gas well sequestration, enhanced coal-bed methane, aquifer sequestration, and ocean sequestration. The divided regions are interlinked through transportations of CO2 and various kinds of energies. The model is an intertemporal optimization type; the objective function is the total cost of energy systems plus CO2 sequestration between 2000 and 2050. Energy supply systems and CO2 capture and sequestration technologies are represented in the bottom-up fashion in order to evaluate technological strategies of CO2 emission mitigation technologies. CO2 sequestration potentials of the 77 divided regions were estimated based on several geographical information systems (GIS) data. The model analysis results show that CO2 sequestration accounts for a large part of the total CO2 emission reduction; the amounts of the cumulative world CO2 sequestration between 2000 and 2050 are about 45 GtC and 65 GtC with and without emission trading, respectively, and that the cost effective strategies differ by region. In the emission trading case, all the four types of underground CO2 sequestration technologies are utilized for US; the sequestration into ocean and aquifer are utilized for Japan. CO2 sequestration technologies would decrease the world marginal cost of CO2 reduction in 2050 by about 59 $/tC. Â© 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Monetization of carbon dioxide and oil and gas production brine: from waste to usable products
AB  - This study explored the vast scale of produced brine available and novel pathways to convert offshore carbon dioxide (CO2) to valuable products. Carbonate structures were selected as host materials with monohydrocalcite (MHC) as the target product. Laboratory simulates comprising carbonate salts of group two metal ions were titrated against CO2 absorbed into dilute alkali solution. The rapid mixing of reactants at pH &gt;9 is essential. Thermal and spectroscopic analyses revealed the product forms and purity of MHC and residual magnesium ions. MHC readily forms at low temperatures and ionic strengths and yet is a feasible material for larger-scale production. Barium and strontium in produced brine depress MHC formation slightly. MHC has low solubility and requires about 5 mole% partial substitutions of calcium by magnesium. The fine-grained and non-agglomerating MHC crystals have beneficial uses. MHC synthesis at room temperature ensures an energy-efficient process and environmentally benign products, forming a basis of a carbon capture process. Â© 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Moderate CO2 sink due to phytoplankton bloom following a typhoon passage over the East China Sea
AB  - In September 2017, following passage of Typhoon Talim, daily satellite imagery captured a large area (âˆ¼300-km long and âˆ¼160-km wide) of high concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl a) that persisted for at least 8 days on the East China Sea (ECS) shelf. Ship-based measurements were conducted 5â€“6 days after the passage of Talim. Results showed that surface seawater within the area of high Chl a concentration had features of high salinity, low temperature, and low partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in comparison with surrounding seawater. The high Chl a concentration reflected a phytoplankton bloom triggered by upwelling nutrient-rich deeper water attributable to the passage of Typhoon Talim. The change in surface pCO2 in the area of high Chl a concentration was explained by the combined effects of upwelling deeper water and subsequent biological production. The airâ€“sea CO2 flux in the area of high Chl a concentration was âˆ’2.8 Â± 0.4 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1 in the post-typhoon stage, which turned the study area from near equilibrium (0.3 Â± 0.3 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1 in the surrounding water) to a moderate CO2 sink. This phytoplankton bloom absorbed 0.013 Tg C during the 8 days following the passage of Talim, effectively canceling out 28% of the typhoon-induced CO2 efflux during typhoon passage across the ECS. Therefore, the effect of typhoons on airâ€“sea CO2 flux in the post-typhoon stage cannot be ignored. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - A Comparison of Carbon Dioxide Sources for Mosquito Capture in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Light Traps on the Florida Gulf Coast
AB  - Traditional sources of carbon dioxide (CO2), dry ice, and compressed gas, were tested against 3 combinations of food-grade reagents known to generate CO2 using a compact, lightweight generator delivery system with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention light traps. Three 6 Ã— 6 Latin square trials were completed near the Florida Gulf Coast in the Lower Suwannee Wildlife Refuge during the summer of 2013, collecting a total of 31,632 female mosquitoes. Treatments included dry ice, compressed CO2 gas, a control trap (no CO2), citric acid + sodium bicarbonate, vinegar + sodium bicarbonate, and yeast + sugar. Decreasing order of trap collections (treatment mean number of mosquitoes per trap night Â± standard error) were dry ice 773.5 (Â±110.1) > compressed gas 440.7 (Â±42.3) > citric acid + sodium bicarbonate 197.6 (Â±30.4), yeast + sugar 153.6 (Â±27.4) > vinegar + sodium bicarbonate 109.6 (Â±16.2) > control 82.4 (Â±14.0). A 2-way Kruskal-Wallis analysis by treatment, site, and treatment Ã— site interaction identified significant differences between all treatments. Although dry ice and compressed CO2 gas collected significantly more mosquitoes than other combinations (P < 0.05), use of citric acid and sodium bicarbonate or yeast and sugar greatly outperformed unbaited traps and offer a good alternative to dry ice and compressed gas in areas where these agents are not readily available or are difficult to obtain due to logistical constraints. An inexpensive, portable CO2 generator for use with food-grade reagents is described. Copyright Â© 2015 by The American Mosquito Control Association, Inc.

AB  - A review has been performed of a possible geological storage system for anthropogenic carbon dioxide based in the Northern United Kingdom. The review has considered sources Of CO2 from BP Amoco operations both onshore and offshore with options to include some large point source power plants situated on the East coast of Scotland. The sources have significantly different characteristics that may favour different capture processes. Potential storage sites include local coal beds and offshore oil fields. Various configurations of a storage hub were considered. Initial results indicate that an onshore source Of CO2 supplying 2 - 4 million tonnes/year to an offshore EOR scheme is, in principle, technically feasible. The economic, technical and HSE issues that must be addressed to make this scheme viable are set out.

TI  - ReEngineered Feedstocks for Pulverized Coal Combustion Emissions Control
AB  - New coal reaction technology called ReEngineered Feedstock (ReEF), consisting of post-recycled paper and plastics, was evaluated for combustion emissions control when cofiring with pulverized coal. Experiments were conducted with four types of ReEF in a 2 in. diameter laboratory-scale fluidized bed combustor system heated to 1200, 1400, and 1600 degrees C. Flue gas emission was continuously monitored with an online infrared multigas analyzer and mass spectrometer. The results indicate that co-firing ReEF with coal provides SO2 emission reduction in flue gas up to 85\% and moderate decrease in NO emissions, as well as higher carbon conversion than pure coal combustion. ReEF, slag and fly ash solids were were analyzed by X-ray diffraction; identification of sulfates in the product ash conclusively supports the mechanism of in situ sulfur capture.

TI  - Power to the people?
AB  - The government wants to see businesses and householders across the UK generating their own energy. Rightly or wrongly, government policy is likely to favor a mix of energy sources in future. New nuclear power stations will come on stream before the decade is out. Coal-fired power stations will continue to operate, although with mandatorily-fitted carbon capture and storage technology, expensive wind and tidal energy farms will find backers, and community energy projects will increase in popularity. The introduction of the feed-in tariffs mechanism in April has been designed to convince businesses, schools, community groups and householders to dip their hand in their pockets to pay for on-site renewables. Climate Change Minister, Greg Barker, says he wants to see what more the Government can do to help develop the microgeneration industry and get more advice to businesses so that they can trust the technology on the market.

TI  - News. Strategic roundtable. Perspectives and Challenges of Technologies for a Methane Age
AB  - The prospects for a global transition to a "Methane Age" are discussed. In the last two centuries, global energy systems have transformed from a reliance on carbon intensive sources such as coal to oil and more recently to natural gas. This has resulted in substantial decarbonization, a driving force for the emergence of the Methane Age. Another driving force is the need for clean and affordable energy services. Access to affordable energy services is crucial for economic development with over 1.3 billion people living in poverty (with &lt; $1 a day) and with 2 billion without access to affordable energy services. A challenge is to develop transboundary trade in natural gas through investment in pipeline and LNG infrastructures. Stationary use of methane for cooking and fuel cells for electricity generation is important for many developing countries. Greater use of natural gas in public transportation can reduce urban air pollution. Current estimates of natural gas resources are of abundance. The more speculative deposits of methane hydrates are gigantic. This is another driving force for the emergence of the Methane Age. Their exploitation would require development of new technologies. Technologies include fuel cells, gas and combined cycle turbines and mini-turbines for electricity generation and cogeneration of heat to steam reforming for hydrogen production. Bridge technologies such as CNG, bio-fuel, gas-to-liquids, and dimethylether (DME) vehicles would diversify the fleet, help reduce emissions, and provide enabling infrastructures for fuel cell vehicles with hydrogen propulsion in the long term. A larger role of natural gas would result in a higher share of global emissions of greenhouse gases and especially of CO2. Technologies for carbon capture and storage would need to be developed and deployed. Already today CO2 is separated and stored in a deep-sea aquifer below the North Sea and carbon dioxide serves as an agent for EOR. The amounts of carbon dioxide to be stored would be enormous from a few to &gt; 500 billion ton of elemental carbon accumulated by 2100. Achieving a hydrogen and electricity age has never been more urgent. The Methane Age can serve as bridge toward the Hydrogen and Electricity Era. It also provides a perspective toward future zero emissions energy systems with universal access to energy services by all.

TI  - A Critical Review of Power Take-Off Wave Energy Technology Leading to the Conceptual Design of a Novel Wave-Plus-Photon Energy Harvester for Island/Coastal Communities' Energy Needs
AB  - As the global interest in renewable energy generation continues, the need to develop new and innovative solutions is being explored every day throughout the world by researchers and innovators. Hybrid renewable energy innovations are gaining progressive interest not only because of the threat of climate change but also due to the technological advancements seen in renewables. Ocean waves have immense potential as a renewable energy source, and related technologies have advanced continuously over the past few decades. In response, this paper extensively studies wave energy converters (WECs) based on the power take-off (PTO) technique, and presents a novel hybrid wave-plus-photon energy (HWPE) harvester called Wavevoltaics, based on wave and solar energy capture systems for coastal communities' power needs, in line with decarbonization measures. The HWPE harvester uses a simple rack-and-pinion mechanism in combination with solar cell technology to convert the wave energy into usable electrical energy in a water column structural design. This novel HWPE device can be used to provide power for lighting and gadgets for coastal communities that rely heavily on fossil fuels for their lighting and electrical needs. Later in the paper, the challenges faced in hybrid wave energy development are presented.

TI  - CCS in the North Sea region: A comparison on the cost-effectiveness of storing CO2 in the Utsira formation at regional and national scales
AB  - The potential scale of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) under long-term decarbonisation scenarios means that analysis on the contribution of large international CO2 storage reservoirs is critical. This paper compares the potentially key role of CCS within cost-optimizing energy systems modelling at the national level (ensuring country-specific technical, economic and policy detail), and the regional level (ensuring transboundary electricity and CO2 trade). Analysis at alternate model scales investigates the full range of drivers on the feasibility and trade-offs in using the Utsira formation as a common North Sea CO2 storage resource. A robust finding is that low carbon electricity is a primary decarbonisation pathway and that CCS plays a key role (32-40\%) within this portfolio. This paper confirms that the overall driver of the amount of CCS utilized is the climate policy, with by 2050 a total of 475-570 MtCO(2) captured and stored (of which 110-120 MtCO(2) is stored in Utsira) under an 80\% CO2 reduction target. Modelled country differences are much larger due to specific national policies and to regional (EU) commodity trading. From 2030 onwards, Utsira plays a key role within the CO2 storage cost curve, with the Netherlands and the UK being the largest contributors, followed by transboundary flows of CO2 from other countries. However, overall regional CCS flows may be larger (for example under low fossil fuel prices) than the estimated (and uncertain) maximum annual injection rates into Utsira which could potentially represent a significant constraint.

TI  - Cost-effective balance between CO2 vessel and pipeline transport: Part II - Design of multimodal CO2 transport: The case of the West Mediterranean region
AB  - As part of large scale application of CO2 capture and storage, million tons CO2 per year have to be transported by pipelines and/or vessels from capture to storage sites. In previous studies, costs of, pipeline systems and point-to-point vessel connections have been estimated. In this research, these cost analysis are supplemented by adding a transport system combining vessel and pipeline transport. The cost savings potential of this multimodal CO2 transport system has been analyzed for the West Mediterranean region (i.e. Spain, Portugal, and Morocco) - where vessel transport can play an important role. In detail: A multimodal extended adaption of a pipeline system optimization model has been defined and was then parameterized adapting a nonlinear vessel and pipeline transport cost model. Next, cost savings due to vessel transport were quantified for the West Mediterranean region. When CO2 emissions are stored in the region itself, cost could be lowered by up to 20\% on routes with low transport volumes and in a complementary way by a redirection of flows at the expense of longer transport distances to prevent costly offshore storage. In case of a European CO2 transport infrastructure including North Sea storage, transport of CO2 by vessel could be profitable if CO2 is used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). However, North Sea neighboring countries can be expected to crowd out Iberian CO2 of the market for EOR storage volumes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Carbon dioxide capture and storage
AB  - A reduction of CO2 emissions from the use of fossil fuel is the primary purpose of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS). CO2 is captured directly form the industrial source, concentrated into a pure form, and then pumped deep underground for long-term storage. It has also been suggested that CO2 can be stored in the ocean as an alternative storage in underground geological formations. CCS can contribute up to 20% of needed CO2 reductions, on par with expected reductions from efficiency improvements and large -scale deployment of renewable energy resources. carbon dioxide can be captured directly from industrial sources by three methods, such as post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture, or combustion of fossil fuels in a pure oxygen environment. Post-combustion capture separates CO 2 from exhaust gas, which consists primarily of a mixture of N 2 and CO2, using chemical solvents such as monoethanolamine.

TI  - Road to Maritime Sector Decarbonization
AB  - Ecospray is actively working on projects for carbon capture in the marine sector, using three different technologies for removing CO2 from exhaust gases: fuel cells, amines scrubbing and calcium hydroxide scrubbing. These different approaches can meet the requirements that are characteristic of different ship types, proposing specific solutions for each case to allow an effective retrofit and to be compliant with the limits imposed by IMO for the next years. The activity, partially carried out in collaboration with the University of Genoa, also led to the establishment of a new joint laboratory devoted to optimize fuel cell performance, while deadlines for onboard or prototypes in Ecospray laboratories are all fixed for middle 2022.

TI  - Transcriptomic response of sea urchin larvae Strongylocentrotus purpuratus to CO2-driven seawater acidification
AB  - Ocean acidification from the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 is expected to have deleterious consequences for many calcifying marine animals. Forecasting the vulnerability of these marine organisms to climate change is linked to an understanding of whether species possess the physiological capacity to compensate for the potentially adverse effects of ocean acidification. We carried out a microarray-based transcriptomic analysis of the physiological response of larvae of a calcifying marine invertebrate, the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, to CO2-driven seawater acidification. In lab-based cultures, larvae were raised under conditions approximating current ocean pH conditions (pH8.01) and at projected, more acidic pH conditions (pH7.96 and 7.88) in seawater aerated with CO2 gas. Targeting expression of -1000 genes involved in several biological processes, this study captured changes in gene expression patterns that characterize the transcriptomic response to CO2-driven seawater acidification of developing sea urchin larvae. In response to both elevated CO2 scenarios, larvae underwent broad scale decreases in gene expression in four major cellular processes: biomineralization, cellular stress response, metabolism and apoptosis. This study underscores that physiological processes beyond calcification are impacted greatly, suggesting that overall physiological capacity and not just a singular focus on biomineralization processes is essential for forecasting the impact of future CO2 conditions on marine organisms. Conducted on targeted and vulnerable species, genomics-based studies, such as the one highlighted here, have the potential to identify potential 'weak links' in physiological function that may ultimately determine an organism's capacity to tolerate future ocean conditions.

TI  - Blue hydrogen must be done properly
AB  - Future energy scenarios include both green and blue hydrogen, as both are needed to scale up decarbonized energy supply. A transition to renewable energy is predicted over time, but the urgency we are facing cannot be met by renewable energy alone. For blue hydrogen production, the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are primarily affected by emissions from natural gas production, processing, and transport (CO2 and methane), as well as process efficiency and carbon capture ratio. Few complete and updated analyses are available that cover the entire blue hydrogen value chain with the best available technology for process facilities, as well as the proper design, operation, and maintenance of all relevant systems and infrastructure. This paper analyses the GHG intensity of blue hydrogen, using recent data as well as input from technology providers on state-of-the-art gas reforming technologies. Data are primarily based on natural gas production and transport in the North Sea Basin, with gas export from the Norwegian continental shelf to continental Europe or the United Kingdom, and with blue hydrogen production either in Norway or near pipeline landfall in the European Union or United Kingdom. Some data related to potential blue hydrogen production in the US Appalachian region are also given. The data show that the properly designed and operated value chains for blue hydrogen supply, with minimal emissions from natural gas supply and high carbon capture in hydrogen production, will give a major reduction in GHG emissions from energy end-use. GHG footprint for end-users based on blue hydrogen will typically be 80%â€“90% lower than for direct supply and use of natural gas. Â© 2022 Equinor.

TI  - RELIABILITY-BASED OPTIMIZATION OF OFFSHORE SALT CAVERNS FOR CO2 ABATEMENT
AB  - In recent years, projects have been proposed to utilize salt caverns as a storage method for supercritical CO2 (s-CO2) and have been carried out around the world, which can effectively reduce the anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG) concentration. Careful and rational design of the salt cavern are required to guarantee the structural stability and reliability of the cavern when in service. In this study, physics-based FE models were first developed to simulate the salt cavern construction process and predict the creep deformation of the cavern wall during s-CO2 storage. In addition, Gaussian process (GP) based surrogate models were constructed from FE simulation results to estimate the properties of salt caverns with cheaper calculations. Then, to obtain a reliable and robust design, an RBDO framework was employed with the assistance of an adaptive fidelity enhancement technique to scan through the high-dimensional design space, which provides a swift and efficient search for the optimal conditions while considering the uncertainties in the salt cavern construction process. This research is one of the first to account for uncertainties within the salt cavern design process, and the results show that uncertainties of variables can strongly affect the system reliability and the volume of the salt cavern.

TI  - C/P RATIOS IN MARINE DETRITUS
AB  - Until reliable procedures have been developed to preserve the phosphorus contained in particulate matter captured by in situ pumps and sediment traps and until these procedures are applied over a wide range of locations and depths in the sea, indirect methods will have to be used to determine the C/P ratio in marine detritus. We have taken two such approaches: (1) the use of C/N ratios for particulates captured in the upper thermocline in conjunction with O-2/P and N/P ratios obtained from deconvolutions of ocean chemical data and (2) regression along isopycnals in the deep-sea waters free of-fossil fuel CO2. While neither approach yields a definitive answer, both suggest that a value of 127 carbon atoms per phosphorus atom would be a more appropriate interim value than that of 106 adopted long ago by A. C. Redfield and his associates.

TI  - Carbon dioxide ocean and ground storage as a method of climate change mitigation
AB  - Global warming-induced climate change is one of the significant civilisation threats of the modern times. Human-induced enhanced global wanning, via the greenhouse effect resulting from high carbon dioxide emissions, poses a substantial danger to the environment we live in. Consequences of global warming can be devastating for the present, but mainly for the future generations. This paper reviews the negative impacts of global warming on our environment, and two still innovative methods of reducing atmospheric concentrations of CO2. The methods discussed in the paper would allow the storage of anthropogenic CO2 originating from large sources of emission, either in the oceans or in the underground geological structures. The Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage method presented is technologically feasible, many of them being demonstrated in different parts of the world. The paper discusses their positive and negative aspects, along with the ability to mitigate against the climate changes. Copyright Â© 2007 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

TI  - How policy choice affects investment in low-carbon technology: The case of CO2 capture in indirect coal liquefaction in China
AB  - An improved understanding of investment decisions on low-carbon technology will greatly facilitate assessing the effectiveness of carbon emissions mitigation policies. We use the example of implementing CCS (carbon capture and storage) within ICL (indirect coal liquefaction), a controversial technology in China, by constructing a RO (real options) model for the investment decision-making process to assess how different climate policies affect low-carbon technology investors under highly uncertain circumstances. We find that a carbon tax provides the strongest signal for investment and that a market-based measure provides firms with flexibility. Moreover, different types of carbon markets generate substantially different effects on firm behavior, and the CO2 price level exerts a more powerful influence on investors than market volatility or the policy's implementation date. Considering the regional disparities among the coal-abundant but less-developed provinces and the affluent coastal regions in China, we suggest that a sub-national CDM (clean development mechanism) would complete the current domestic policy framework to balance the development requirement and CO2 abatement, whereas extraordinary administrative efforts are necessary to raise the current price of CO2 credits to an effective level, to broaden the carbon market coverage and consolidate the carbon market foundation.

TI  - Characterization of a potential CO2 storage site in a carbonate aquifer - Example from the South Adriatic offshore
AB  - The Southern Adriatic Sea is one of the five perspective areas for CO2 storage being evaluated under the FP7 European SiteChar project. This site is the most challenging among those studied in this project, since the potential reservoir is hosted in a carbonate formation. In a first instance, the 3D geological static model at both regional and local scale, was constructed, based on the analysis and the interpretation of the available geological, geophysical and borehole data. Coupled fluid flow and geomechanical modeling has been also performed, through the simulation of various scenarios (i.e. open, closed or mid-opened faults, in situ different stress regimes). Dynamic modeling shows that CO2 injection-induced overpressure extends up to 30 km when faults are open, and that sealing capacity of the faults impacts the stress field and the propagation of the CO2 plume around the injection point. The site characterization procedure that has been applied on the Southern Adriatic offshore can be considered as an example that could be adopted when investigating reservoir carbonate formations, especially where crucial information for modeling are missing and need to be derived through an analytical approach.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Marine Gas Seeps Using an Interferometric Sidescan Sonar
AB  - There is a significant need for reliable, cost-effective, and preferably automatic methods for detecting and monitoring marine gas seeps. Seeps at the seafloor may originate from natural sources including sediments releasing biogenic methane and volcanoes releasing CO2, or from man-made constructions such as pipelines or well heads, and potentially also from subseafloor CO2 storage sites. Improved seep detection makes it possible to estimate the amount of greenhouse gases entering the oceans, and to promptly detect and address potential leaks to reduce environmental and economical consequences. Sonar is an excellent tool for seep detection due to the strong acoustic backscatter properties of gas-filled bubbles in water. Existing methods for acoustic seep detection include multibeam and sidescan surveying, as well as active and passive sensors mounted on a stationary platform. In this work, we develop a new method for automatic seep detection using an interferometric sidescan sonar. We apply signal processing techniques combined with knowledge about acoustical and spatial properties of seeps for improved detectability. The proposed method fills an important gap in existing technology-the ability to automatically detect a seep during a single pass with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with an interferometric sidescan sonar. Results from simulations as well as field data from two leaking abandoned wells in the North Sea indicate that small seeps are consistently detected on a sandy seafloor even when the observation time is limited (a single pass with the AUV). We explore the detection capability for different seafloor types ranging from silt to gravel.

TI  - `Slippery slope' or `uphill struggle'? Broadening out expert scenarios of climate engineering research and development
AB  - It is increasingly recognised that meeting the obligations set out in the Paris Agreement on climate change will not be physically possible without deploying large-scale techniques for either removing greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere or reflecting sunlight away from the Earth. In this article we report on the findings of a scenarios method designed to interrogate how far these `climate engineering' ideas may develop in the future and under what governance arrangements. Unlike previous studies in climate engineering foresight that have narrowly focussed on academic perspectives, a single climate engineering idea and a restricted range of issues, our approach sought to respond to theoretical imperatives for `broadening out' and `opening up' research methods applied to highly uncertain and ambiguous topics. We convened a one-day event with experts in climate change and climate engineering from across the sectors of government, industry, civil society and academia in the UK, with additional experts from Brazil, Germany and India. The participants were invited to develop scenarios for four climate engineering ideas: bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, direct air capture and storage, stratospheric aerosol injection and marine cloud brightening. Manifold challenges for future research were identified, placing the scenarios in sharp contrast with early portrayals of climate engineering research as threatening a `slippery slope' of possible entrenchments, lock-ins and path dependencies that would inexorably lead to deployment. We suggest that the governance challenges for climate engineering should therefore today be thought of as less of a slippery slope than an `uphill struggle' and that there is an increasingly apparent need for governance that responsibly incentivises, rather than constrains, research. We find that affecting market processes by introducing an effective global carbon price and direct government expenditure on research and development are incentives with broad potential applications to climate engineering. Responsibly incentivising research will involve a pluralistic architecture of governance arrangements and policy instruments that attends to collective ambitions as well as national differences and emerges from an inclusive and reflexive process.

TI  - The development and comparison of CO2 BOG re-liquefaction processes for LNG fueled CO2 carriers
AB  - CO2 carriers are considered as a solution for CO2 transport as a part of Carbon Capture and Storage. CO2 carriersâ€™ design is similar to that of commercial liquefied gas carriers and core technology of liquefied gas carriers is to handle boil-off gas during voyages. This paper introduced newly developed CO2 boil-off gas re-liquefaction processes making use of cold LNG fuel and investigated economic feasibility of newly developed processes by comparison with a conventional boil-off gas re-liquefaction process. New processes enabled considerable main equipment costs saving and additional fuel cost saving for re-liquefying boil-off gas. Simulation study results showed total amount of boil-off gas in a LNG fueled CO2 carrier could be re-liquefied by LNG fuel consumed during the voyage and comparative cost assessment results demonstrated those newly developed processes could be applied into a LNG fueled CO2 carrier with insignificant additional cost. The finding of this paper confirms those newly introduced processes are technically and commercially feasible at present and will contribute to growing the potential market of LNG as a marine fuel as well as commercializing CCS technology by providing more cost-effective solution for CO2 shipping.

TI  - Geological Storage of CO2 in DF1-1 Gas Field South China Sea: Design of a demonstration project
AB  - DF1-1 gas field is located in the west of the South China Sea, which is associated with high concentration of CO2. Currently CO2 separated from the natural gas stream is emitted into the atmosphere. In this study, a demonstration project of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) is considered, proposing to inject CO2 separated on the platform back into the original gas reservoir. The CO2 storage site considered is a nearly abandoned gas block in the DF1-1 gas field. Membrane separation technique will be installed on the platform for the separation. CO2 is compressed at supercritical state and injected through a single well (used to be a producer). A new platform auxiliary to the main platform will be built to accommodate the compressor and separation equipment. CO2 will be injected at the rate of 0.14 million Sm3/d for 10 years over the field development period. At the end of the project, the pressure of the CO2 storage reservoir will be increased to its original pressure. Scoping economic analysis shows that the CO2 storage cost of the project is around US$20 per ton CO2, in which the auxiliary platform is the main cost factor.

TI  - Supply chain optimization for electricity-based jet fuel: The case study Germany
AB  - Electricity-based jet fuel from renewables, also labeled sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), is expected to play a key role in the defossilization of aviation. The realization of first plants for the production of such power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels is imminent. This raises the challenge of an effective PtL supply chain design, which is addressed in this work. A novel optimization approach is introduced that enables an integrated selection of sites and technologies. Economically favorable supply chain designs are presented for the case study of Germany, with production primarily located in the wind power rich greater North Sea coast area. The Heide Refinery and Emsland Lingen Refinery sites are particularly suited for fuel synthesis, while cement and iron \& steel plants are preferred as CO2 point sources. This study shows that at an electricity price of 0.05 euro kWh(-1), the costs for SAF production and supply range from 2052 to 2258 euro t(-1). The minimum is obtained at a production volume equivalent to 4 \% of the national jet fuel demand. To achieve the envisioned 2030 target of 2 \% PtL SAF, an investment volume of 1.6 Beuro is expected.

TI  - 3D modelling and capacity estimation of potential targets for CO2 storage in the Adriatic Sea, Italy
AB  - One of the most innovative and effective technologies developed in recent decades for reducing carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere is carbon capture and storage (CCS). It consists of capture, transport and injection of CO2 produced by energy production plants or other industries. The injection takes place in deep geological formations with the suitable geometrical and petrophysical characteristics to trap CO2 permanently in the subsurface, which is called geological storage. In the development process of a potential geological storage site, correct capacity estimation of the injectable volumes of CO2 is one of the most important aspects. There are various approaches to estimate CO2 storage capacities for potential traps, including geometrical equations, dynamic modelling, numerical modelling and 3D modelling. In this work, the generation of 3D petrophysical models and equations for calculation of the storage volumes are used to estimate the effective storage capacity of four potential saline aquifers in the Adriatic Sea offshore. The results show how different saline aquifers, with different lithologies at favourable depths, can host a reasonable amount of CO2, which will require further and more detailed feasibility studies for each of these structures. A detailed analysis is carried out for each saline aquifer identified, varying the parameters of each structure identified and adapting them for a realistic estimate of potential geological storage capacity.

TI  - Development of a Reactive Hydraulic Modulator (RHM)
AB  - It is recognised that reactive control for WECs offers increased energy capture potential. To date, an infinitely variable reactive control strategy has not been implemented, presumably due to the perceived complexity, reliability and efficiency issues presented by such technologies. This paper discusses development of the Reactive Hydraulic Modulator (RHM). This is a generic, infinitely variable reactive control device based on known high reliability marine technology. The paper discusses modelling of requirements, development of the control philosophy, and physical design of a unit to achieve reactive control. The impact of reactive control on cost of energy for WECs is discussed. Existing hydraulic PTO concepts appear to employ simple passive operation or switching control. The RHM offers increased energy capture, meaning that this technology will be more cost effective, even allowing for higher capital costs. The paper discusses the previous experience of MacTaggart Scott in high integrity hydraulic solutions with integrated sensing and control, how this capability has attracted the support of the Carbon Trust, and how the RHM has been developed by applying a unique combination of known technologies to the problem. The importance of assembly, maintenance free operation, modularity of components and overall installation is discussed. Further development work on the RHM concept is also discussed: â€¢ Applicability to different types of WECs. â€¢ Seawater as a fluid to address environmental concerns. â€¢ Using active control to smooth wave farm output and 'detune' the device to allow continued generation in higher seastates.

TI  - An application of probabilistic risk assessment PRA methodology in the optimization of CO2 injection well locations for CO2 storage development plan, offshore Malaysia
AB  - A depleted gas field in the Sarawak basin, offshore Malaysia, was selected as a candidate geological site for CO2 storage. The selection and design for the CO2 injection well locations are an important decision making in the business planning, which involved a complicated risk assessment system covering subsurface and surface integration. The objective in this paper is to apply the probabilistic risk assessment method in the optimization of CO2 injection well locations for the CO2 storage development plan. Risk comes from uncertainty, so the workflow with probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) methodology includes: 1) the risk identification and sensitivity analysis: the definition of uncertainty elements; 2) the risk analysis: the uncertainty ranges and distributions; and 3) Risk evaluation: including the individual element and composite risk evaluation. Similar to risk matrix method, two parameters used: 1) the likelihood (Pi) of occurrence of each consequence, expressed by the percentile of a threshold; and 2) the severity magnitude (Ii) of the possible adverse consequences, expressed by the coefficient of variation. The total risk is the sum of the products of Pi and Ii, displayed on the risk map. The workflow and methodology were applied in a depleted gas reservoir for CO2 storage. The main elements identified for uncertainty analysis include: 1) structural model including the top of reservoir depth and internal reservoir zonation; 2) reservoir parameters based on porosity and permeability; 3) fluid contacts. Combing all possible cases for each element, a number of scenarios of reservoir models were constructed, which are the foundation of risk evaluation. Risk score, expressed by probability, was calculated by all elements, generating a composite risk probability map, where there are different risk levels at different locations. Combining with engineering constraints, the CO2 injection well locations were selected by optimization, avoiding the area with high risk. Â© 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - Harvesting energy from salinity differences using battery electrodes in a concentration flow cell
AB  - Salinity-gradient energy (SGE) technologies produce carbon-neutral and renewable electricity from salinity differences between seawater and freshwater. Capacitive mixing (CapMix) is a promising class of SGE technologies that captures energy using capacitive or battery electrodes, but CapMix devices have produced relatively low power densities and often require expensive materials. Here, we combined existing CapMix approaches to develop a concentration flow cell that can overcome these limitations. In this system, two identical battery (i.e., faradaic) electrodes composed of copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) were simultaneously exposed to either high (0.513 M) or low (0.017 M) concentration NaCl solutions in channels separated by a filtration membrane. The average power density produced was 411 Â± 14 mW m-2 (normalized to membrane area), which was twice as high as previously reported values for CapMix devices. Power production was continuous (i.e., it did not require a charging period and did not vary during each step of a cycle) and was stable for 20 cycles of switching the solutions in each channel. The concentration flow cell only used inexpensive materials and did not require ion-selective membranes or precious metals. The results demonstrate that the concentration flow cell is a promising approach for efficiently harvesting energy from salinity differences. Â© 2016 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Learnings from the Shell Peterhead CCS Project Front End Engineering Design
AB  - Commercial-scale demonstration of carbon capture and storage (CCS) is required to advance wide-spread implementation of CCS technology across a range of carbon-intensive industries, in order to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to atmosphere. Capturing the learnings from leading demonstration projects is key for design optimisation, technology development and in turn, cost reduction. The importance of knowledge sharing and dissemination of learnings is of particular importance for CCS in order to maximise the cost-competitiveness of the technology across industry and energy markets and help reduce the overall costs to society for decarbonisation. Shell led the development of the Peterhead CCS (PCCS) project in the UK, from which the learnings from the completed front end engineering design (FEED) phase of the project have been identified and captured. In line with the agreement with the UK government, who sponsored part of the FEED phase, the learnings have been shared publically for the benefit of future follow on projects. The project completed FEED in 2015, the same year in which the project was cancelled due to UK Government withdrawal of funding for the UK CCS Commercialisation Competition. The Peterhead CCS project FEED phase comprised design work for CO2 capture from the Peterhead gas fired power station using Shell Cansolv technology. The project design also encompassed pipeline transport of the CO2 through an existing pipeline to the CO2 subsurface storage site in the North Sea Goldeneye reservoir, utilising the existing offshore platform. This paper provides an overview of learnings from across both the technical and non-technical spectrums, including key technical CCS specific topics, as well as learnings from engagement with stakeholders, and development of regulatory frameworks. The learnings shared can be applied to the design of future CCS projects to reduce costs, optimise the technology, and realise public and regulatory support. The development of the FEED provided confidence that the construction and operation of the PCCS project was feasible and that the project was in a position to advance to the next stage of the development.

TI  - CO2 fixation by membrane separated NaCl electrolysis
AB  - Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), a major cause of global warming, have been rising due to industrial development. Carbon capture and storage (CCS), which is regarded as the most effective way to reduce such atmospheric CO2 concentrations, has several environmental and technical disadvantages. Carbon capture and utilization (CCU), which has been introduced to cover such disadvantages, makes it possible to capture CO2, recycling byproducts as resources. However, CCU also requires large amounts of energy in order to induce reactions. Among existing CCU technologies, the process for converting CO2 into CaCO3 requires high temperature and high pressure as reaction conditions. This study proposes a method to fixate CaCO3 stably by using relatively less energy than existing methods. After forming NaOH absorbent solution through electrolysis of NaCl in seawater, CaCO3 was precipitated at room temperature and pressure. Following the experiment, the resulting product CaCO3 was analyzed with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR); field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) image and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were also analyzed. The results showed that the CaCO3 crystal product was high-purity calcite. The study shows a successful method for fixating CO2 by reducing carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere while forming high-purity CaCO3. Â© 2015 by the authors.

TI  - Electricity generation technologies: Comparison of materials use, energy return on investment, jobs creation and CO2 emissions reduction
AB  - Shifting to a low-carbon electricity future requires up-to-date information on the energetic, environmental and socio-economic performance of technologies. Here, we present a novel comprehensive bottom-up process chain framework that is applied to 19 electricity generation technologies, consistently incorporating 12 life-cycle phases from extraction to decommissioning. For each life-cycle phase of each technology the following 4 key metrics were assessed: material consumption, energy return ratios, job requirements and greenhouse gas emissions. We also calculate a novel global electricity to grid average for these metrics and present a metric variability analysis by altering transport distance, load factors, efficiency, and fuel density per technology. This work quantitatively supports model-to-policy frameworks that drive technology selection and investment based on energetic-economic viability, job creation and carbon emission reduction of technologies. The results suggest energetic-economic infeasibility of electricity generation networks with substantial shares of: i) liquefied natural gas transport, ii) long distance transport based hard and brown coal and pipeline natural gas, and iii) low-load factor solar-photovoltaic, concentrated solar power, onshore and offshore wind. Direct sector jobs can be expected to double in renewable-majority scenarios. All combustion-powered technologies without natural (biomass) or artificial carbon capture (fossil fuels) are not compatible with a low carbon electricity generation future. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - How to decarbonise international shipping: Options for fuels, technologies and policies
AB  - International shipping provides 80-90\% of global trade, but strict environmental regulations around NOx, SOx and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are set to cause major technological shifts. The pathway to achieving the international target of 50\% GHG reduction by 2050 is unclear, but numerous promising options exist. This study provides a holistic assessment of these options and their combined potential to decarbonise international shipping, from a technology, environmental and policy perspective. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is reaching mainstream and provides 20-30\% CO2 reductions whilst minimising SOx and other emissions. Costs are favourable, but GHG benefits are reduced by methane slip, which varies across engine types. Biofuels, hydrogen, nuclear and carbon capture and storage (CCS) could all decarbonise much further, but each faces significant barriers around their economics, resource potentials and public acceptability. Regarding efficiency measures, considerable fuel and GHG savings could be attained by slow-steaming, ship design changes and utilising renewable resources. There is clearly no single route and a multifaceted response is required for deep decarbonisation. The scale of this challenge is explored by estimating the combined decarbonisation potential of multiple options. Achieving 50\% decarbonisation with LNG or electric propulsion would likely require 4 or more complementary efficiency measures to be applied simultaneously. Broadly, larger GHG reductions require stronger policy and may differentiate between short- and long-term approaches. With LNG being economically feasible and offering moderate environmental benefits, this may have short-term promise with minor policy intervention. Longer term, deeper decarbonisation will require strong financial incentives. Lowest-cost policy options should be fuel- or technology-agnostic, internationally applied and will require action now to ensure targets are met by 2050.

TI  - CO2 geological storage potential in Korea
AB  - According to the forecast of the International Energy Agency (IEA), CCS has the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and could contribute to 19% of global carbon dioxide mitigation by 2050. Korean government recently announced that Korea has set its voluntary 2020 emissions reduction target to a 30 % reduction from its forecast under a "business as usual" scenario, which is equivalent to 4% less than the 594 million tons of carbon that was emitted in 2005. CCS is included to achieve this target. This paper first explains the CO2 storage potential both in onshore and offshore areas in Korea. While onshore sedimentary basins seem to have unfavorable physical properties such as porosity and permeability, offshore sedimentary basins exhibit very good physical properties in sand thickness and porosity. In order to implement CCS project at the scale needed to achieve a meaningful reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, the knowledge of the available CO2 storage capacity obtained by detailed matching of large stationary CO 2 sources with geological storage sites is required. Most CCS programs in Korea, however, are not integrated with capture and storage projects. This paper considers the feasibility of CO2 capture and storage in Korea and shows several conceptual business models for CCS projects with the recent E&amp;P activities in the continental shelf.

TI  - Acorn: Developing full-chain industrial carbon capture and storage in a resource- and infrastructure-rich hydrocarbon province
AB  - Research to date has identified cost and lack of support from stakeholders as two key barriers to the development of a carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) industry that is capable of effectively mitigating climate change. This paper responds to these challenges through systematic evaluation of the research and development process for the Acorn CCS project, a project designed to develop a scalable, full-chain CCS project on the north-east coast of the UK. Through assessment of Acorn's publicly available outputs, we identify strategies which may help to enhance the viability of early-stage CCS projects. Initial capital costs can be minimised by infrastructure re-use, particularly pipelines, and by reuse of data describing the subsurface acquired during oil and gas exploration activity. Also, development of the project in separate stages of activity (e.g. different phases of infrastructure reuse and investment into new infrastructure) enables cost reduction for future build-out phases. Additionally, engagement of regional-level policy makers may help to build stakeholder support by situating CCS within regional decarbonisation narratives. We argue that these insights may be translated to general objectives for any CCS project sharing similar characteristics such as legacy infrastructure, industrial clusters and an involved stakeholder-base that is engaged with the fossil fuel industry.

TI  - Cost estimation of CCS integration into thermal power plants in Japan
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is an important technology to reduce CO2 emissions from power and industry. To accelerate large-scale CCS deployment, further reduction of the cost to implement the full technology chain is necessary. Full chain CCS cost depends on multiple technological, market, and societal factors. Therefore, case-specific cost analysis is important. This study estimates the CCS cost in Japan, which can be considered as a case study for specific countries where offshore sites are more suitable for CO2 storage than onshore sites regarding geological reasons and barrier reduction of public/political acceptance. With the phasedown of unabated coal power, retrofitting amine-based post-combustion CO2 capture system is a realistic way for pulverized coal-fired power plants. Capture cost was determined by the process simulation of coal-fired power plant retrofits. Current political realities in Japan suggest that CO2 transport will be done by ship. Transport cost was estimated via a bottom-up analysis of each sub-process. Injection and monitoring cost was based on the values reported by the Tomakomai demonstration project, which are applicable to onshore injection into an offshore storage site. We find the full chain CCS cost to be 99-111 USD/t-CO2. Though changing the solution in the CO2 capture process from monoethanolamine to the blend of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol and piperazine reduces the regeneration energy by 0.85 GJ/t-CO2, the CCS cost was only reduced by similar to 9 USD/t-CO2. Likewise, even when the regeneration energy was reduced to 2.0 GJ/t-CO2 using a hypothetical amine solution embedded in a highly optimized PCC system, the CCS cost was still similar to 93 USD/t-CO2. Considering that capital expenditure accounts for similar to 65\% of capture cost, downsizing capture facilities may provide further cost reduction. Since transport and storage costs were roughly equivalent to capture costs, full chain CCS implementation is likely necessary to reduce costs through learning-by-doing, scale-out, and market effects.

TI  - Japan's role in carbon capture and storage
AB  - Like China, Europe, and the US, Japan has been developing not only its domestic carbon capture and storage program but also helping projects beyond its shores to come to realization. On 12/15/2017, Toshiba Energy Systems &amp; Solutions Corporation (Toshiba ESS) had begun construction of a large-scale carbon capture facility at the 50 000 kW Mikawa Power plant. Slated to start up during 2020 and capture 500 ton/day of CO2, Toshiba EES will use data collected from the unit to evaluate the performance of the capture unitâ€™s technology along with costs and environmental effects. Also, the firm completed, during 2016, what is claimed to be the worldâ€™s first commercial-use carbon capture and utilization system at a municipal waste incineration plant. Knowledge gained from all these projects will be used in the design of systems for capturing CO2 from various exhaust gas streams. funding_textÂ 1={This latest project is part of a â€œmajor five year projectâ€, led by Toshiba Corporation and Mizuho Information & Research Institute (MHIR), to promote clean energy generation.

TI  - Transportation systems for CO2 - Application to carbon capture and storage
AB  - Commercialization of carbon capture and storage from fossil fuelled power plants requires an infrastructure for transportation of the captured carbon dioxide (CO2) from the sources of emission to the storage sites. This paper identifies and analyses different transportation scenarios with respect to costs, capacity, distance, means of transportation and type of storage. The scenario analysis shows that feasible transportation alternatives are pipelines (on and off shore), water carriers (off shore) and combinations of these. Transportation scenarios are given for different transportation capacities ranging from a demonstration plant with an assumed capacity of 200 MW e (1Mt/y of CO2) up to a system of several large 1000 MWe power plants in a coordinated network (40 Mt/y up to 300 Mt/y of CO2). The transportation costs for the demonstration plant scenario range from 1 to 6â‚¬/ton of CO2 depending on storage type and means of transportation. The corresponding figure for the coordinated network scenario with off shore storage is around 2â‚¬/ton of CO2. Â© 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Gearing toward CCUS for CO2 reduction in Malaysia
AB  - PETRONAS has embarked on Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) of Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) related technologies since 2011. The main purpose in pursuing R&amp;D in this area is to monetize high CO2 gas fields through technology development. At initial stage, area that has been focusing were on capture, transportation and storage only. Later, utilization became an area of focus since there is a need to convert CO2 to valuable product in order to make high CO2 gas fields development more viable. R&amp;D in the area of CO2 capture namely advanced membrane separation, advanced cryogenic distillation as well as supersonic technologies were conducted. For ultra high CO2 gas field (&gt; 50 mol% CO2), a hybridization of separation technology are key to ensure economic viability of the fields development. In term of CO2 storage, several critical areas has been studied especially wells drilling technology, CO2 injectivity, storage technology involving geomechanic &amp; geochemistry fields model and measurement as well as monitoring and verification technologies for the stored CO2. CO2 mineralisation technology is also explored to convert CO2 into valuable product. Furthermore, K5 Strategic Technology Project is undertaken in order to showcase and prove all the newly develop technologies. Â© 2018, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - htegration of MD with captured CO2 flue gas compression
AB  - The improvement of specific energy consumption and the reduction of steam temperature to drive the system are two of the main challenges to improve the performance of distillation processes in desalination plants, especially for multi-effect distillation technique. The low temperature requirement is a suitable characteristic to integrate multi-effect distillation units as bottom system. Obviously, one of the best options is to use low-grade heat from power plants or gas turbines as a cogeneration system. Mitigation of CO2 emissions from power plants will be a priority for most of power companies in a near future, one of the most promising techniques is carbon capture and storage. Nevertheless, energy requirements and efficiency penalties in the overall system are some of their disadvantages. They are largely caused by CO2 compression above both its critical temperature and pressure prior storage. There are a huge low-grade heat coming from condensing water in the CO2 stream and from compressors intercooling that is suitable to reduce energy penalties in CO2 capture process and to produce desalted water. With the aim of analyzing these combined systems (desalination unit, power plant and CO2 capture), five different integration configurations have been proposed and simulated. Three aspects have been analyzed: the energy penalty in the steam cycle, the water costs associated to thermal energy and their environmental impact. Results show that although CO2, capture systems reduce power generation and therefore increases its costs, available heat from those systems could produce distilled water at affordable costs.

TI  - Permeable bio-reactive barriers to address petroleum hydrocarbon contamination at subantarctic Macquarie Island
AB  - A reliance on diesel generated power and a history of imperfect fuel management have created a legacy of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination at subantarctic Macquarie Island. Increasing environmental awareness and advances in contaminant characterisation and remediation technology have fostered an impetus to reduce the environmental risk associated with legacy sites. A funnel and gate permeable bio-reactive barrier (PRB) was installed in 2014 to address the migration of Special Antarctic Blend diesel from a spill that occurred in 2002, as well as older spills and residual contaminants in the soil at the Main Power House. The PRB gate comprised of granular activated carbon and natural clinoptilolite zeolite. Petroleum hydrocarbons migrating in the soil water were successfully captured on the reactive materials, with concentrations at the outflow of the barrier recorded as being below reporting limits. The nutrient and iron concentrations delivered to the barrier demonstrated high temporal variability with significant iron precipitation observed across the bed. The surface of the granular activated carbon was largely free from cell attachment while natural zeolite demonstrated patchy biofilm formation after 15 months following PRB installation. This study illustrates the importance of informed material selection at field scale to ensure that adsorption and biodegradation processes are utilised to manage the environmental risk associated with petroleum hydrocarbon spills. This study reports the first installation of a permeable bio-reactive barrier in the subantarctic. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Capturing the market
AB  - Ben Sampson reflects on the Â£165 million allocation by European Union (EU) to Powerfuel for its carbon capture and storage (CCS) project in Hatfield, Yorkshire despite an untried technology, vague plans, and an indifferent oil and gas industry. Powerfuel outdid some big companies in the energy sector to the funding, including E.On, RWE Npower, and Scottish Power. Powerfuel received funding despite the fact that it has not yet built any coal power station from which to extract carbon dioxide and has only vague plans about carbon dioxide transportation and storage. The EU's reasoning is also far from clear, with a statement citing Powerfuel's highly innovative concept and the fact that work can begin immediately. National Grid says its Yorkshire/Humber pipeline network, as mentioned in the Powerfuel plans, could be ready by 2014 and would carry 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year to the North Sea.

TI  - CO2 Technology Centre Mongstad - Design, Functionality and Emissions of the Amine Plant
AB  - The CO2 Technology Centre Mongstad (TCM) project is constructing two large post-combustion CO2 capture demonstration plants near the Statoil operated Mongstad refinery, located at the Norwegian west coast north of Bergen. TCM's partners are Gassnova, Statoil, Sasol and Norske Shell. This paper describes the amine plant. The amine plant is designed and constructed by the CO2 capture technology provider Aker Clean Carbon (ACC) with specifications and additional generic functionalities defined by TCM. Several new technology elements will be tested and verified, including improved solvents. Monoethanolamine and a new ACC solvent will be tested during the initial 16 months of operations. Thereafter tests will be run by the TCM partners. The quality and quantity of the emissions from the absorber to air have become top priority. Currently they represent a health and environmental uncertainty, mainly due to the lack of reliable and accessible experimental data. While knowledge and experience of these emissions are rapidly increasing, an emission permit is being applied for. The amine plant is highly flexible and can combine several novel technologies. Due to its scale it will give valuable information on utility and space requirements, scale-up properties and contribute to reducing HSE risks and costs. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The growth of political support for CO2 capture and storage in Norway
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has enjoyed stronger political support in Norway than in other countries. Early CCS initiatives were motivated by the challenge of reconciling relatively ambitious climate policy targets with growing emissions from Norway's offshore oil and gas operations, whose expertise and project opportunities formed the basis for these initiatives. The early start of the CCS debate created political path dependence effects, including recruitment of much of the environmental sector (government agencies and some NGOs) as CCS promoters. Paradoxically, the historical absence from Norway of fossil-based power generation also favoured CCS. Initiatives to add gas-fired generating capacity to Norway's previously emissions-free power supply created an entrenched conflict in which CCS became a politically necessary compromise. The more recent growth in political support for CCS in other countries may be explained by the fact that governments increasingly experience similar, politically difficult climate/energy policy dilemmas.

TI  - New technology for offshore CO2 reservoir monitoring and flow control
AB  - A novel, cost-saving approach combining advanced electronic and chemical technologies for rapidly acquired reservoir flow measurements and early-alteration of flows is described. The combined technologies improve CO2 injection, leak detection, and reservoir flow management in offshore CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects. The approach is based on old and new technologies that have been field-proven in land-based operations. It employs reservoir flow-induced micro-deformation measurements by tiltmeters and absolute seafloor position monitoring using global positioning systems combined with underwater acoustic distance measurements from the sea surface to instruments installed in the seafloor over offshore reservoirs. These systems can acquire micro-deformation data, which allows for geomechanical inversion analysis to provide 3-D reservoir flow images. Real-time temperature, pressure, and other data from fiber-optic sensors may also be needed to better characterize some CO2 flows. New flow-controlling and leak-sealing chemical systems and placement methods combined with conventional ones have improved the options for management of flow paths both inside and outside of offshore reservoirs. The paper includes a discussion on how the monitoring technology has evolved from similar methods proven in EOR projects, and more recently in CCS projects, to identify reservoir flows and pinpoint abnormal ones. An example of normal CO2 flow results is presented to show how operators can calibrate flow-prediction software models and make fast decisions to apply flow enhancing methods that improve CO2 sweep efficiency, increase oil production, and better utilize reservoirs' CO2 storage capacity. Another example shows the early identification of an abnormal-flow path location that enables operators to make timely selections of sealing methods and materials to eliminate unwanted flows inside or outside of reservoirs and ensure planned CO2 plume movement and containment within reservoirs. The CO 2 flow controlling and remediation technology's history of field proven success is described along with the recently developed versions. Generic case histories of conventional methods on land vs. the proposed offshore systems are compared to show how the new approach creates synergy that can improve the performance of offshore CO2 EOR and CCS projects while reducing operating costs.

TI  - Algal biofuel production and mitigation potential in India
AB  - Energy and energy services are the backbone of growth and development in India and is increasingly dependent upon the use of fossil based fuels that lead to greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and related concerns. Algal biofuels are being evolved as carbon (C)-neutral alternative biofuels. Algae are photosynthetic microorganisms that convert sunlight, water and carbon dioxide (CO2) to various sugars and lipids Tri-Acyl-Glycols (TAG) and show promise as an alternative, renewable and green fuel source for India. Compared to land based oilseed crops algae have potentially higher yields (5-12 g/m(2)/d) and can use locations and water resources not suited for agriculture. Within India, there is little additional land area for algal cultivation and therefore needs to be carried out in places that are already used for agriculture, e.g. flooded paddy lands (20 Mha) with village level technologies and on saline wastelands (3 Mha). Cultivating algae under such conditions requires novel multi-tier, multi-cyclic approaches of sharing land area without causing threats to food and water security as well as demand for additional fertilizer resources by adopting multi-tier cropping (algae-paddy) in decentralized open pond systems. A large part of the algal biofuel production is possible in flooded paddy crop land before the crop reaches dense canopies, in wastewaters (40 billion litres per day), in salt affected lands and in nutrient/diversity impoverished shallow coastline fishery. Mitigation will be achieved through avoidance of GHG, C-capture options and substitution of fossil fuels. Estimates made in this paper suggest that nearly half of the current transportation petro-fuels could be produced at such locations without disruption of food security, water security or overall sustainability. This shift can also provide significant mitigation avenues. The major adaptation needs are related to socio-technical acceptance for reuse of various wastelands, wastewaters and waste-derived energy and by-products through policy and attitude change efforts.

TI  - General interest: EPA proposes rules covering carbon dioxide storage
AB  - On 7/15/2008, EPA released proposals for a category of injection wells for long-term underground CO2 storage as Congress contemplates carbon capture and storage technology. The proposed rules, which outline storage siting, testing, and monitoring requirements, fall under EPA's existing Underground Injection Control program. They would update the 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act. EPA hopes to ensure that stored CO2 does not move or leach heavy metals or other contaminants out of surrounding rock into underground water. A final rule is expected in late 2010 to early 2011. The proposed rules would apply to CO2 injection wells onshore and in state territorial waters within 3 mi of the US coast. CO2 wells drilled beyond the 3-mi limit would fall under the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act. The proposed rules would provide a minimum level of safeguards. EPA will accept public comment on the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for 120 days following its publication.

AB  - Anthropogenic input of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere and its uptake by the ocean with associated changes in ocean chemistry have created an urgent need to expand coverage of sea surface and atmospheric carbon dioxide observations. Conventional sampling platforms (e.g. ships and moorings) do not provide the spatial and temporal resolution needed to assess the effects of rapidly changing carbon dioxide conditions and are expensive to operate. Through a series of deployments beginning in March 2012, two versions of the Wave Glider autonomous surface vehicles from Liquid Robotics, Inc. have been instrumented with sensors to measure pH, partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) of the atmosphere and sea surface, and wind speed and direction, from which instantaneous sea-air fluxes of CO2 can be calculated. These deployments, most near Monterey Bay, California, were highly correlated with Î”pCO2 measurements obtained from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute's (MBARI) long-term mooring station M1, as well as from shipboard observations. In the central California upwelling system with highly variable pCO2 levels, the gliders captured large spatial gradients associated with upwelling fronts. Differences in sea surface pCO2 as large as 470 Î¼atm over &lt; 0.5 km were observed. Unlike traditional ship sampling methods, however, this new generation of sampling platforms is capable of continuous long-term (months) deployments at a fraction of the cost. The vehicles thus have the potential of filling important gaps in present understanding of the effects of global change on ocean chemistry. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Legal challenges of carbon capture and storage in the South China Sea region
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one method to reduce CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. As CCS has the greatest potential for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction, it gains a wide currency in the developed countries. However, the technology for CCS does not spread at the international level especially to the developing countries like South China Sea states. As the CO2 storage period is quite long and potential environmental risks involved, fully deployed CCS projects need not only the technological support but the appropriate legal and regulatory regime to safeguard CCS operations. This article offers a survey of CCS projects in the South China Sea region and discusses the legal challenges associated with CCS activities in state practice.

TI  - Conceptual Design of CO2 Transportation System for CCS
AB  - Reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emission is strongly requested in relation to the global warming issue. The development of innovative technology including Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS) is required to achieve the CO2 reduction targets. Because of the geological structure of the domestic complex in Japan, reservoirs near sources of emissions have not enough storage capacity of CO2. Therefore, transportation to suitable sites will be necessary for large amount of CO2 storage. Three methods of transporting CO2 from coal-fired power plant to offshore storage sites near Japan's coastline were studied. One with transporting liquefied CO2 by ship, another with transporting CO2 hydrate by ship, and the third by a pipeline. Transportation distance is approximately 700-1,000km for the former two cases, and 120km for pipeline. The case study on a demonstration scale and a commercial use was executed. The CO2 transport volume set for each case is 240,000 ton-CO2/year and 1,540,000 ton-CO2/year respectively. This research was executed as a contract study from New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO). (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - On risk control in the well plug and abandonment phase: The case of the Norwegian Continental Shelf
AB  - Numerous oil and gas wells in the North Sea are now reaching their end of productive life. The main challenges at the end of the well life phase are: (i) how to recover the remaining resources, and (ii) how to plug and abandon (P&amp;A) the wells and associated structures in a cost-efficient way. Well P&amp;A operations could according to a study contribute with up to 25% of the total costs of exploration wells in the North Sea. The long-term sealing capability will also be a critical factor because of substantial costs of potentially having to re-enter a leaking wellbore. Probabilistic risk assessments (PRA) will be key in identification of optimal P&amp;A solutions. The use of PRA in cost and risk control of well systems are not new, however, the amount of research, guidelines and frameworks proposed for PRA of long-term well P&amp;A concepts remain scarce. A literature search revealed only a few methods proposed that may be of some direct relevance to PRA. Most of the available literature is related to leakage risk modelling associated with CO2 capture and storage, which as such may not be directly adoptable to North Sea exploration wells. In this article we: (i) identify and discuss key risk factors for developing a PRA modelling framework for well systems in the P&amp;A phase on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS), and (ii) based on Weibull statistics and a strongest link argument, propose a novel modelling approach to PRA within this framework.

TI  - Making the Case for Ultra-Light Combined Cycle ULCC Power Plants inOffshore Oil and Gas Applications
AB  - This paper focuses on the use of ultra-light combined cycle (ULCC) power plants in offshore oil and gasapplications. The paper will discuss the advantages ULCC plants can provide when compared to gas turbines(GTs) operating in simple/open cycle configurations, which have traditionally dominated the offshoremarket. The majority of floating, storage, production, and offloading (FPSO) vessels and fixed offshore platformsin operation today utilize gas turbines in simple cycle configuration. Thermal efficiency of these plantstypically ranges from 30-45%. Combined cycle plants offer much higher efficiencies, however, theiruse in offshore oil and gas applications has been limited mainly due to weight and space constraints. Inrecent years, Siemens has made numerous design enhancements which have reduced weight and footprint ofcombined cycle designs by up to 50%. ULCC is now a concept based on proven technologies that can deliversubstantial reductions in CO2 emissions, helping offshore operators meet increasingly strict environmentalregulations. When compared to two open cycle GTs, ULCC canreduceCO2 emissions by 80,000-110,000 t/annum. Insome offshore regions, this equates more than $5 million in annual savings from carbon taxes and licenses.This excludes savings that can be captured from reduced fuel consumption, especially when the GT is runin feedstock. The entire ULCC package can be provided as a pre-installed module (i.e., plug and play) andis applicable to both new builds and brownfields. The concept has been designed for ease of installationand been optimized to solve typical offshore challenges, with a focus on constructability, maintainability,motions, footprint and weight.

TI  - Numerical simulation of fluid flow and heat transfer of supercritical CO2 in micro-porous media
AB  - International attention has been considerably paid for the technology of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) these days because of global warming. In line with the fact that carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technology has been regarded as one of the most promising option to mitigate the climate change and global warming, we have started a 10-year R&amp;D project on CO 2 storage in marine geological structure. We carried out relevant studies, which cover the initial survey of potentially suitable marine geological structure for CO2 storage site, monitoring of the stored CO2 behavior, basic design for CO2 transport and storage process including onshore/offshore plant and assessment of potential environmental risk related to CO2 leakage in storage site. The purpose of this paper is to model and simulate a CO2 flow and its heat transfer characteristics in a storage site for more accurate evaluation of the safety of CO2 storage process. Among CCS technologies, the prediction of CO2 behavior in underground is very critical for CO2 storage design with safety. As a part of the storage design, a micro pore-scale model was developed to mimic real porous structure and CFD (computational fluid dynamics) was applied to calculate the CO2 flow and thermal fields in the micro pore-scale porous structure. Varying CO 2 injection conditions, the behavior of the CO2 flow was calculated. Especially, physical conditions such as temperature and pressure were set up equivalent to the underground condition at which the CO2 fluid was injected. From the results, the characteristics of the flow and thermal fields of CO2 were scrutinized and the influence of CO 2 injection condition on the flow was investigated in the micro pore-scale porous structure.
