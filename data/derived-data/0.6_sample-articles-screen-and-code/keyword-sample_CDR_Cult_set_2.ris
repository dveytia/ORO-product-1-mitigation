TI  - Advances in the utilisation of carbon-neutral technologies for a sustainable tomorrow: A critical review and the path forward
AB  - Global industrialisation and overexploitation of fossil fuels significantly impact greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in global warming and other environmental problems. Hence, investigations on capturing, storing, and utilising atmospheric CO2 create novel technologies. Few microorganisms, microalgae, and macroalgae utilise atmospheric CO2 for their growth and reduce atmospheric CO2 levels. Activated carbon and biochar from biomasses also capture CO2. Nanomaterials such as metallic oxides, metal-organic frameworks, and MXenes illustrate outstanding adsorption characteristics, and convert CO2 to carbon-neutral fuels, creating a balance between CO2 production and elimination, thus zeroing the carbon footprint. The need for a paradigm shift from fossil fuels and promising technologies on renewable energies, carbon capture mechanisms, and carbon sequestration techniques that help reduce CO2 emissions for a better tomorrow are reviewed to achieve the world's sustainable development goals. The challenges and possible solutions with future perspectives are also discussed. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Bioactivity of a Marine Diatom (Porosira glacialis [Grunow] JÃ¶rgensen 1905) Cultivated with and without Factory Smoke CO2
AB  - Using industrial emissions as a strategy for CO2 sequestration through carbon capture and utilization (CCU) in cultivation of microalgae can potentially change cultivation factors such as pH, nutrient availability and presence of trace metals, which could alter the growth and metabolism of the microalgae. It is therefore important to investigate whether such changes in culturing conditions can lead to changes in the diatoms metabolism, such as production of unwanted toxic compounds or by reduction of the diatoms' natural ability to control the growth of competing microorganisms (e.g., by decreasing the production of antibacterial compounds). The cold-water marine diatom Porosira glacialis was cultivated in two, 6,000-L photobioreactors in an industrial setting; one culture had the direct addition of factory smoke, and to the other fresh air was added. The biomass was extracted and screened for toxicity in viability assays against human cells (cancer and normal lung fibroblasts) and development of sea urchin larvae (Paracentrotus lividus). Bioactivity was tested in two bacterial assays: growth inhibition assay and anti-biofilm assay. The results confirm earlier reports on the presence of toxic compounds against human cell lines and P. lividus larvae, but no elevated toxicity could be detected using factory smoke. Anti-biofilm activity was present in both cultures. This indicates that the natural toxic properties of the microalgae do not increase by adding factory smoke, and that we keep the beneficial ability of the microalga to suppress growth of bacteria. These are key elements in a successful, industrial-scale cultivation as the product is safe and at the same time the monocultures are not being contaminated by competing organisms.

TI  - High quality water supply for the production of algae
AB  - Microalgae are unique photosynthetic organisms given that they accumulate storage lipids in substantial quantities and thrive in high salinity water. Algae cultivation is flexible on water quality. Many species of algae thrive in seawater, water from saline aquifers, or even wastewater from treatment plants. Photosynthesis, algae use solar energy to fix carbon dioxide (CO 2) into algal biomass, so the water used to cultivate algae must be enriched with CO 2. Microalgae can potentially be employed for the production of biofuels in an economically effective and environmentally sustainable manner. Microalgae have been investigated for the production of a number of different biofuels including biodiesel, bio-oil, bio-syngas, and bio-hydrogen. The production of these biofuels can be coupled with flue gas CO 2 mitigation, wastewater treatment, and the production of high-value chemicals. Â© Sila Science.

TI  - The Analysis on the Current Situation of the Utilization Mode of Microalgal Biomass Materials
AB  - In recent years, global warming caused by the greenhouse effect has become one of the greatest threats to mankind. This will have a serious impact on the environment and human body, such as land desertification, increase in ocean acidity, sea level rise, and increase in pests and diseases; affect people's normal work and rest; and make people feel dizzy and nauseated. Excessive emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main component of the greenhouse gas, have contributed to the continued rise in Earth's temperature. Although the world is vigorously developing clean energy to reduce carbon emissions, it will not replace fossil fuels in the short term. The conversion of biomass into energy is the most important way of energy utilization. Biomass energy refers to the solar energy stored in biomass in the form of chemical energy and is the fourth major energy source after oil, coal, and natural gas. At present, biofuels have gone through three developmental stages, which can be divided into first-generation biofuels, second-generation biofuels, and third-generation biofuels according to the types of raw materials and development history. The first generation of biofuels produced from food crops, such as bioethanol derived from sucrose and starch, has already entered the energy market. However, because the first generation of biofuels uses food crops as raw materials, there is a phenomenon of "competing with people for food,"and it is difficult to achieve large-scale application. To avoid the problem of food shortages, second-generation biofuels produced from nonfood crops, such as wood fiber, have been developed. Microalgae biomass energy is favored by governments and scholars all over the world because of its unique advantages of fast reproduction speed and high oil content. The cultivation of microalgae does not occupy traditional farmland, and the marginal land such as mountains, oceans, and deserts can cultivate microalgae, or develop microalgae cultivation in the air through the innovation of microalgae photosynthetic reactors. When municipal wastewater, food industry wastewater, and aquaculture wastewater are used as the medium for large-scale cultivation of microalgae, and waste gas from biogas power generation, flue gas from coal power plants, and industrial waste gas from fermentation are used as the CO2 gas source for large-scale cultivation of microalgae, it can be further reduced. The comprehensive production cost of microalgae bioenergy plays a significant emission reduction effect. Combining the above advantages, the use of microalgae to produce first- or second-generation bioenergy has become a new research direction. This study focuses on the review of microalgal biomass in fuel, nonfuel, wastewater treatment, and fuel cell. Â© 2022 Lina Zhang et al.

TI  - Macroalgal biomass as a potential resource for lactic acid fermentation
AB  - Lactic acid is an essential platform chemical with various applications in the chemicals, food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. Currently, the demand for lactic acid is driven by the role of lactic acid as the starting material for the production of bioplastic polylactide. Microbial fermentation for lactic acid production is favored due to the production of enantiomerically pure lactic acid required for polylactide synthesis, as opposed to the racemic mixture obtained via chemical synthesis. The utilization of first-generation feedstock for commercial lactic acid production is challenged by feedstock costs and sustainability issues. Macroalgae are photosynthetic benthic aquatic plants that contribute tremendously towards carbon capture with subsequent carbon-rich biomass production. Macroalgae are commercially cultivated to extract hydrocolloids, and recent studies have focused on applying biomass as a fermentation feedstock. This review provides comprehensive information on the design and development of sustainable and cost-effective, algae-based lactic acid production. The central carbon regulation in lactic acid bacteria and the metabolism of seaweed-derived sugars are described. An exhaustive compilation of lactic acid fermentation of macroalgae hydrolysates revealed that lactic acid bacteria can effectively ferment the mixture of sugars present in the hydrolysate with comparable yields. The environmental impacts and economic prospects of macroalgal lactic acid are analyzed. Valorization of the vast amounts of spent macroalgal biomass residue post hydrocolloid extraction in a biorefinery is a viable strategy for cost-effective lactic acid production. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - WIRELESS ISFET PH SENSOR NETWORK FOR OFFSHORE MICROALGAE CULTIVATION
AB  - Microalgae technology continues to show tremendous promise for becoming a major source of renewable transportation fuel in the coming decades. Ho Weyer, for microalgae to provide a significant fraction of the current US demand for fuel, their cultivation will be required on an enormous scale. One of the many formidable challenges that must be met to achieve this scale is the development of appropriate sensor networks to provide information about the growth conditions and the algae themselves. These sensors would monitor the heterogeneity of a) environmental parameters, such as pH, oxygen, and nutrient levels and b) algal characteristics such as size, oil content, and viability. Here we present a wireless sensor network to measure the local pH in NASA OMEGA project (Offshore Membrane Enclosures for Growing Algae). The pH is measured using Ion Sensitive Field Effect Transistor (ISFET) technology, which is more robust and has a faster response than traditional glass pH electrodes. A custom circuit drives the ISFET sensor and interfaces with an ANT wireless network system. The wireless network consists of a network hub which can service up to 8 sensor nodes and a series of relays to transmit the data to a PC. The data is logged with a custom Lab VIEW program. In this work, we demonstrate operation of this network using a single ISFET pH sensor, one hub, and two relay units. The performance of the pH sensor network is evaluated and compared in parallel with an existing wired glass electrode based pH monitoring system at the NASA OMEGA project.

TI  - Bioreactors for microalgae: A review of designs, features and applications
AB  - The marine environment offers unique commercial opportunities: besides constituting two thirds of our planet and being readily accessible, it encompasses most of its biodiversity-which, unfortunately, remains unexploited for its most part. Its potential goes indeed well beyond current applications-with biodiesel and pharmaceutical principles being two examples thereof. Microalgae encompass a vast group of photosynthetic microorganisms, possessing a notable metabolic versatility: they can grow to large viable numbers under various conditions of temperature, pH and salinity, at the expense of low cost inorganic N-and P-sources, sequester CO2 as C-source, and rely on plain sunlight for energy input. This makes them probably the most promising stakeholders in blue biotechnology; however, development of microalga-mediated technologies has been constrained by their relatively low volumetric productivities in industrial photobioreactors-both in terms of biomass and metabolites. Although growth can be brought about at low cost in large-scale outdoor ponds, uniform temperature, light distribution and CO2 concentration are difficult to provide and control; furthermore, microbial contamination may occur, thus slowing down the rate, and putting at risk the specifications of target metabolite production. Hence, current R&amp;D efforts have preferentially focused on closed systems. Photobioreactors suitable for microalgae are considerably different from fermenters designed for bacteria, yeasts and fungi; recent developments have specifically addressed such issues as efficient mixing, good light dilution and conduction, and membrane-mediated transport of gas. Moreover, advances in downstream processing are still required-as often times the final production cost hinges critically upon biomass harvesting and extraction, rather than production itself. Overall, industrial feasibility demands construction and processing costs to remain low. Despite current efforts, there is not such a thing as "the best reactor system"-i.e. able to achieve maximum productivity at minimum operation costs for every type of objective function; in fact, choice of the most suitable system depends on both the microorganism selected and the final purpose envisaged. This chapter reviews the major features of existing production systems encompassing microalgae, pinpoints shortcomings and discusses opportunities for improvement-so as to eventually guarantee commercial success on the long run. For convenience, it is subdivided into subsections on: Introduction; Forms of metabolism, which includes photoautotrophic, heterotrophic, mixotrophic and photoheterotrophic, as well as comparison of different cultivation conditions; Reactor design, which includes open pond and closed photobioreactor configurations; Processing parameters, which include temperature, O2 transfer, CO2 transfer, pH, and carbon and nitrogen sources-and their specific ratios, light requirement, stirring / mixing, area to volume ratio, and transparency and durability of the construction material; and finally Conclusions.

TI  - Identification of carbohydrates as the major carbon sink of the marine microalga Isochrysis zhangjiangensis (Haptophyta) and optimization of its productivity by nitrogen manipulation
AB  - Microalgae represent a potential feedstock for biofuel production. During cultivation under nitrogen-depleted conditions, carbohydrates, rather than neutral lipids, were the major carbon sink of the marine microalga Isochrysis zhangjiangensis (Haptophyta). Carbohydrates reached maximum levels of 21.2 pgcell-1 on day 5, which was an increase of more than 7-fold from day 1, while neutral lipids simultaneously increased 1.9-fold from 4.0 to 7.6 pgcell-1 during the ten-day nitrogen-depleted cultivation. The carbohydrate productivity of I. zhangjiangensis was improved by optimization of the nitrate supply mode. The maximum carbohydrate concentration was 0.95 gL-1 under batch cultivation, with an initial nitrogen concentration of 31.0 mgL-1, which was 2.4-fold greater than that achieved under nitrogen-depleted conditions. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that the accumulated carbohydrate in I. zhangjiangensis was composed of glucose. These results show that I. zhangjiangensis represents an ideal carbohydrate-enriched bioresource for biofuel production. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Installing kelp forests/seaweed beds for mitigation and adaptation against global warming: Korean Project Overview
AB  - Chung, I. K., Oak, J. H., Lee, J. A., Shin, J. A., Kim, J. G., and Park, K.-S. 2013. Installing kelp forests/seaweed beds for mitigation and adaptation against global warming: Korean Project Overview. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 70: 1038-1044.Seaweed beds can serve as a significant carbon dioxide (CO2) sink while also satisfying global needs for food, fodder, fuel, and pharmaceutical products. The goal of our Korean Project has been to develop new baseline and monitoring methodologies for mitigation and adaptation within the context of climate change. Using innovative research approaches, we have established the Coastal CO2 Removal Belt (CCRB), which comprises both natural and man-made plant communities in the coastal region of southern Korea. Implemented on various spatial-temporal scales, this scheme promotes the removal of CO2 via marine forests. For example, when populated with the perennial brown alga Ecklonia, a pilot CCRB farm can draw down âˆ¼10 t of CO2 per ha per year. This success is manifested by an increment in biomass accumulations and a decrease in the amount of dissolved inorganic carbon in the water column.

TI  - Can greening of aquaculture sequester blue carbon?
AB  - Globally, blue carbon (i.e., carbon in coastal and marine ecosystems) emissions have been seriously augmented due to the devastating effects of anthropogenic pressures on coastal ecosystems including mangrove swamps, salt marshes, and seagrass meadows. The greening of aquaculture, however, including an ecosystem approach to Integrated Aquaculture-Agriculture (IAA) and Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) could play a significant role in reversing this trend, enhancing coastal ecosystems, and sequestering blue carbon. Ponds within IAA farming systems sequester more carbon per unit area than conventional fish ponds, natural lakes, and inland seas. The translocation of shrimp culture from mangrove swamps to offshore IMTA could reduce mangrove loss, reverse blue carbon emissions, and in turn increase storage of blue carbon through restoration of mangroves. Moreover, offshore IMTA may create a barrier to trawl fishing which in turn could help restore seagrasses and further enhance blue carbon sequestration. Seaweed and shellfish culture within IMTA could also help to sequester more blue carbon. The greening of aquaculture could face several challenges that need to be addressed in order to realize substantial benefits from enhanced blue carbon sequestration and eventually contribute to global climate change mitigation.

TI  - Reply to Stafford's (2022) comment on ``Seaweed ecosystems may not mitigate CO2 emissions{''} by Gallagher et al. (2022)
AB  - The comment qualitatively suggests that seaweed ecosystems are global carbon sinks. This was in contradiction to the article that showed that seaweed ecosystems are on average measurably carbon sources within the canopy. Furthermore, this was amplified by the remineralization of a large fraction of exported seaweed production, as estimated from published parameters. It appeared that the comments' conclusion was mistaken from two standpoints. First, a view that the article did not consider the impact of the phytoplanktonic assemblage on the seaweed ecosystems' global sequestration rate. This had been previously calculated as likely, not significant. Second, a view that the consumption and subsequent respiration of exported material cannot be included in ecosystems that are generally open to allochthonous organic carbon subsidies. Nevertheless, the comment does raise the importance of a more holistic view in assessing sequestration services. The response expands the article's arguments from different standpoints and consequences to illustrate where the comment has been mistaken, and points out where the article was misread. We also expand on the comments' call for a more holistic approach by being more explicit on what drives both sequestration and mitigation through the extreme circumstances where this could be maximized, including phytoplankton contributions.

TI  - A review of macroalgae production, with potential applications in biofuels and bioenergy
AB  - This review discusses biofuel and bioenergy production from seaweed, and ranges from cultivation to final product, and investigates opportunities, problems, advantages, disadvantages and other issues of this emerging industry. High levels of structural polysaccharides and low lignin contents make seaweed attractive feedstocks for production of liquid biofuels via fermentation and biogas production via anaerobic digestion. Since macroalgae can be grown in water (oceans and lakes), they will not compete with land-based crops, and thus will not be in competition with human foods. And biofuel and bioenergy production from macroalgae has some environmental benefits. Electricity produced from biogas derived from macroalgae can be cost-competitive to solar thermal, solar photovoltaic and biomass generated electricity. Biofuel and bioenergy production from macroalgae, however, will entail higher costs than terrestrial biomass feedstocks due to higher costs of cultivation and higher costs to remove harmful content such as sulfur and nitrogen from the resulting fuel or heavy metals from the residues. Economic production of biofuels and bioenergy will be available by increasing the scale and efficiency of production of this emerging resource. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Biomass, total lipid production, and fatty acid composition of the marine diatom Chaetoceros muelleri in response to different CO2 levels
AB  - The marine diatom Chaetoceros muelleri grown under air (0.03% CO2), 10%, 20%, and 30% CO2 conditions was evaluated to determine its potential for CO2 reduction coupled with biodiesel production. The results indicated that C. muelleri grows well with high CO2 aeration levels (10-20%) and is induced to accumulate lipids under 10-30% CO2. In particular, the highest values of the maximum biomass concentration (1.059gL-1), maximum specific growth rate (0.868d-1), maximum biomass productivity (0.272gL-1d-1), maximum CO2 biofixation (0.428gL-1d-1), and total lipid (43.40% dry weight) and neutral lipid contents were all obtained with 10% CO2 aeration. Moreover, the analysis of the fatty acid composition of C. muelleri revealed the predominance of C14-C18 fatty acids (&gt;90%) and saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (&gt;80%) under all CO2 levels. The results suggest that C. muelleri has great potential to biodiesel production using flue gases. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - From Pest to Profit-The Potential of Shipworms for Sustainable Aquaculture
AB  - We face a food crisis. Suboptimal diet is the biggest cause of death worldwide, food production the biggest greenhouse gas emitting sector, and by 2050 an extra 2.5 billion people need affordable nutrition. Current farming systems will fail to tackle this crisis, and there is an urgent need to diversify global food production and find effective solutions in currently underexploited food sectors. Shipworms, or shell-lessTeredoclams, could prove a highly valuable component of such solutions. Historically viewed as a marine pest, they have unique physiological characteristics which make them an ideal food source, including exceptionally fast growth rates, the ability to feed on waste wood or sustainable microalgae, and a high protein and omega 3 content. Today only a select few traditional cultures in the Philippines consume shipworms, but there is considerable opportunity to develop mechanisms to farm shipworms and provide a sustainable, nutrient rich, affordable food source. This will require significant challenges to be overcome, ranging from fundamental research to industry development to food processing and marketing. Leveraging new innovations in breeding, aquaculture feeds, growth systems, food processing methodologies and consumer engagement can however offer powerful solutions, and could help turn what was once a maritime villain into a nutritional savior.

TI  - A Guide to International Climate Mitigation Policy and Finance Frameworks Relevant to the Protection and Restoration of Blue Carbon Ecosystems
AB  - The protection, management and restoration of vegetated ecosystems on land and in the ocean ('natural climate solutions') can be a useful strategy for reducing net greenhouse gas emissions to help limit global warming. Their potential contribution to reducing net emissions has led to the development of policies and financial incentives for their protection and restoration. These have in turn created a set of expectations among some stakeholders, and interest in expanding these to encompass other ecosystems. However, there are specific rules about how abatement is calculated in international policy and climate finance, and the frameworks and terminology associated with them are often complex. This can be a barrier to stakeholders who want to leverage the potential of natural climate solutions, sometimes leading to incongruence between realised and anticipated benefits. In this article, we attempt to outline some of the key international policy and carbon market frameworks for coastal `blue carbon' ecosystems, and the extent to which different ecosystems are accommodated. Currently, among the coastal ecosystems, only mangrove forests, seagrass meadows, and tidal marshes are typically considered in international policy and carbon market frameworks. The defining feature of these ecosystems is that the foundation species are plants that grow in sediment (soil). They are the only coastal ecosystems currently included in IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories, and in compliance and voluntary carbon markets. There is interest in potentially including other marine ecosystems, such as kelp forests and unvegetated tidal flats, into carbon accounting frameworks, but there are unresolved questions about whether sequestration and storage of carbon by these ecosystems meets the rigorous standards required. Voluntary carbon markets have greater flexibility than mechanisms linked to national greenhouse gas inventories, and so might be early implementers of expanding methods to include other ecosystems. Incorporating coastal ecosystems into national greenhouse gas inventory is a useful action countries can take that will likely help generate incentives for protection and restoration of these important ecosystems.

TI  - Genetic Engineering of Algae for Enhanced Biofuel Production
AB  - There are currently intensive global research efforts aimed at increasing and modifying the accumulation of lipids, alcohols, hydrocarbons, polysaccharides, and other energy storage compounds in photosynthetic organisms, yeast, and bacteria through genetic engineering. Many improvements have been realized, including increased lipid and carbohydrate production, improved H-2 yields, and the diversion of central metabolic intermediates into fungible biofuels. Photosynthetic microorganisms are attracting considerable interest within these efforts due to their relatively high photosynthetic conversion efficiencies, diverse metabolic capabilities, superior growth rates, and ability to store or secrete energy-rich hydrocarbons. Relative to cyanobacteria, eukaryotic microalgae possess several unique metabolic attributes of relevance to biofuel production, including the accumulation of significant quantities of triacylglycerol; the synthesis of storage starch (amylopectin and amylose), which is similar to that found in higher plants; and the ability to efficiently couple photosynthetic electron transport to H-2 production. Although the application of genetic engineering to improve energy production phenotypes in eukaryotic microalgae is in its infancy, significant advances in the development of genetic manipulation tools have recently been achieved with microalgal model systems and are being used to manipulate central carbon metabolism in these organisms. It is likely that many of these advances can be extended to industrially relevant organisms. This review is focused on potential avenues of genetic engineering that may be undertaken in order to improve microalgae as a biofuel platform for the production of biohydrogen, starch-derived alcohols, diesel fuel surrogates, and/or alkanes.

TI  - What is the level of incentivisation required for biomethane upgrading technologies with carbon capture and reuse?
AB  - This paper documents a techno-economic assessment of biomethane feedstocks from urban, rural, and coastal settings. Additionally, the effect of three upgrading technologies was investigated, ranging from commercialised systems (water scrubbing) to more advanced systems: power to gas systems employing hydrogen to capture CO2; and microalgae cultivation utilising CO2 in biogas. In total, nine scenarios were investigated based on a combination of the three feedstock groups and the three upgrading technologies. The levelized cost of energy and the incentive required to allow financial sustainability were assessed. The assessment showed that water scrubbing was the cheapest upgrading method. The optimum scenario was the combination of urban based feedstock (food waste) with water scrubbing upgrading costing 87(sic)/MWh, equivalent to 87c/L. diesel equivalent. The incentive required was 0.13 (sic)/m(3) (or per L of diesel equivalent), however if power to gas was used to upgrade, an incentive of 0.40 (sic)/m(3) was required. This was expected as food waste attracts a gate fee. Rural-based plants (using slurries and grasses) are expected to provide the majority of the resource however, for this to become a reality incentive in the range 0.86-1.03 (sic)/m(3) are required.

TI  - Experimental cultivation of giant kelp in oceanic environments
AB  - Producing biomass in the ocean was conceived in the late 1960s by Hall and Wilcox as an alternative energy source whose attractions included abundances of available space on the sea surface, plant nutrients in the ocean depths, and environmental energy in the waves and currents. Efforts by these two scientists and by many others has led to the Marine Biomass Project. The Project is a cooperative research program managed by General Electric Co. with participation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (kelp processing studies). Institute of Gas Technology (methane production studies), Global Marine Development, Inc. (marine engineering), and California Institute of Technology (kelp production studies), as well as supporting microbiological and other studies within General Electric. The primary objective is to develop an integrated system for producing, harvesting, and processing marine biomass, followed by conversion to methane. Giant Kelp, Macrocystis, is under current study as the producer of biomass, but other seaweed species may eventually be used. This paper describes primarily the kelp production studies. Objectives of the kelp production studies include: (a) determine elements needed in Macrocystis nutrition, (b) develop an optimal strategy for fertilizing plants in an oceanic setting, (c) determine harvest yields from a group of adult test plants continually fertilized. The most promising common source of plant nutrients in the sea lies in waters at depths of 100 m or greater. These could be pumped up by environmental energy to fertilize kelp held near the surface on artificial structures. Our laboratory work indicates that available micronutrients present in water from 300 m deep are usually depleted in surface waters, but the reverse may sometimes be true for some trace metals such as Fe and Mn. Therefore, appropriate mixtures of surface and deep water may be the optimal fertilizing medium.

TI  - The microbial safety of seaweed as a feed component for black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) larvae
AB  - Farmed insects can offer an environmentally sustainable aquafeed or livestock feed ingredient. The value of black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) (BSF) larvae could be improved by enrichment in omega-3 through the dietary inclusion of seaweed. However, the industry practice of drying seaweed at low temperatures to retain nutritional properties may benefit the survival of human pathogenic bacteria, particularly if the seaweed has been harvested from contaminated water. Here we have demonstrated that E. coli and E. coli O157:H7 died-off in seaweed dried at 50 Â°C, although both were detected in the dried powder following 72 h storage. V. parahaemolyticus fell below the level of detection in stored seaweed after drying at â‰¥ 50 Â°C, but L. monocytogenes remained detectable, and continued to grow in seaweed dried at â‰¤60 Â°C. Therefore, drying seaweed at low temperatures risks pathogen carry-over into insects destined for animal feed. BSF larvae reared on an artificially contaminated seaweed-supplemented diet also became contaminated by all four bacteria present in the supplement. Water quality at seaweed harvesting sites, seaweed desiccation, and insect rearing practices, represent critical points where development of regulatory standards could achieve targeted control of pathogenic hazards.

TI  - The german case study: Pioneer projects of aquaculture-wind farm multi-uses
AB  - Most studies on multi-use concepts of aquaculture and wind farms explored cultivation feasibility of extractive species, such as seaweed or bivalves. However, recent studies also included the cultivation of crustaceans or fish culture in the vicinity of wind turbines. Consequently, new approaches combine fed and extractive species in integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) concepts for offshore multi-use to reduce nutrient output and the overall environmental impact of aquaculture operations. In this chapter the findings of a series of mussel and oyster cultivation experiments over several seasons are presented, which were conducted at different offshore test sites in the German Bight. Sites were selected within future offshore wind farm areas for an explicit multi-use perspective. Results have demonstrated successful growth and fitness parameters of these candidates and therefore definitely proved the suitability of these bivalve extractive species for open ocean aquaculture. Another approach for multi-use in offshore wind farms is its use as marine protected area or even for reinforcement or restoration of endangered species, which need the absence of any fisheries activity for recovery. Current projects are testing this perspective for the native European oyster Ostrea edulis and the European lobster Homarus gammarus. From the technological point of view there are many options on how to connect aquaculture devices, such as longline and ring structures as well as different cage types, to the foundations as well as to install it in the centre of the free area between wind turbines. Next to the system design also experiments on drag forces originating from the aquaculture structure on the foundation and vice versa were investigated. Complementary to the biological, environmental end technical aspects, a number of studies were specifically targeted to address and include stakeholders, their attitudes, their interests and concerns over time. By this approach, the inclusion of stakeholders into the research process from its very beginning until today, co-production of knowledge could be fostered. Next to joint identification of the major impediments and concerns of offshore aquaculture under multi-use conditions, new issues and research questions were identified. Primary focus on the economic potential of aquaculture in offshore wind farms was shown for consumption mussels. The production of mussels using longline technology is sufficiently profitable even under the assumption of substantial cost increases. This is especially true, if existing capacities could be used. Last but not least, the EEZ is a special area-it is not a state territory even if a coastal state has its sovereign rights and jurisdiction. It is an area where three legal systems come together: International law, law of the European Union and national law. There are no mariculture projects in the German EEZ and no approval procedure has been completed so far. Some sites are not suitable for mariculture, especially because of nature conservation and shipping. Â© The Author(s) 2017.

TI  - Present status and prospect of ocean thermal energy conversion for sustainable energy, water resources, and fishery resources
AB  - An Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) is a system of converting thermal energy in electricity by using the temperature difference between warm water at the surface of the ocean and cold water at its depths. Ocean thermal energy just like solar energy is a natural energy and is renewable. OTEC can be product flesh water, hydrogen, lithium, uranium, seaweed and fish etc. from the sea water that is used in OTEC Plant. There are many projects of OTEC in the world, for example India, USA, and Taiwan etc. In this paper, first a principle of OTEC is described. The history of OTEC development is shortly described. The present status and prospect of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion is shown for Sustainable Energy, Water Resources, and Fishery Resources. The possibility of OTEC is explained using the experimental data of Institute of Ocean Energy, Saga University.

TI  - Review of nutrient enrichment and global warming effects on seagrasses
AB  - Seagrass beds support important ecosystem services, such as sediment stabilization, water quality improvement and carbon sequestration. In recent years, seagrass beds have declined worldwide. Considering eutrophication and global warming, we summarized the effects of nutrient enrichment and global warming on seagrasses. In oligotrophic environments, nitrate and ammonium can promote seagrass growth. Nitrate enrichment can disturb carbon balance of seagrass tissues, therefore negatively impacting seagrasses because nitrate needs to be reduced into nitrite, and then transformed into amino acid by a series of metabolism processes. Higher concentration ammonium can induce seagrass decline due to its toxicity. Organic nitrogen, as selectable nitrogen source of seagrasses, is effectively complementary nitrogen for seagrass. Temperature, as one of the important variables, controls seagrasses distribution and growth. Modest nutrient enrichment can increase seagrass production in spring, but higher temperature and nutrient enrichment can inhibit seagrass growth in summer. Nutrient enrichment and higher temperature in summer also accelerate macroalgae blooms, resuhing in light attenuation and shift from seagrasses to macroalgae ecosystems. Further directions of research on seagrasses should include seagrass bed observation in a long term, effects of organic nitrogen on seagrasses, combined effects of nutrient enrichment and increasing temperature on seagrasses, and responses of tropical seagrass respiration to global warming.

TI  - Connected macroalgal-sediment systems: blue carbon and food webs in the deep coastal ocean
AB  - Macroalgae drive the largest CO2 flux fixed globally by marine macrophytes. Most of the resulting biomass is exported through the coastal ocean as detritus and yet almost no field measurements have verified its potential net sequestration in marine sediments. This gap limits the scope for the inclusion of macroalgae within blue carbon schemes that support ocean carbon sequestration globally, and the understanding of the role their carbon plays within distal food webs. Here, we pursued three lines of evidence (eDNA sequencing, Bayesian Stable Isotope Mixing Modeling, and benthic-pelagic process measurements) to generate needed, novel data addressing this gap. To this end, a 13-month study was undertaken at a deep coastal sedimentary site in the English Channel, and the surrounding shoreline of Plymouth, UK. The eDNA sequencing indicated that detritus from most macroalgae in surrounding shores occurs within deep, coastal sediments, with detritus supply reflecting the seasonal ecology of individual species. Bayesian stable isotope mixing modeling {[}C and N] highlighted its vital role in supporting the deep coastal benthic food web (22-36\% of diets), especially when other resources are seasonally low. The magnitude of detritus uptake within the food web and sediments varies seasonally, with an average net sedimentary organic macroalgal carbon sequestration of 8.75 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1). The average net sequestration of particulate organic carbon in sediments is 58.74 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1), the two rates corresponding to 4-5\% and 26-37\% of those associated with mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds, systems more readily identified as blue carbon habitats. These novel data provide important first estimates that help to contextualize the importance of macroalgal-sedimentary connectivity for deep coastal food webs, and measured fluxes help constrain its role within global blue carbon that can support policy development. At a time when climate change mitigation is at the foreground of environmental policy development, embracing the full potential of the ocean in supporting climate regulation via CO2 sequestration is a necessity.

TI  - Isotopic labeling of cultured macroalgae and isolation of C-13-labeled cell wall polysaccharides for trophic investigations
AB  - Macroalgae are considered as major primary producers in coastal environments, acting as a global carbon sink. This abundant biomass contains up to 50\% of storage or cell wall polysaccharides, which therefore represent a reservoir of organic matter for potential algal consumers. Tracking of natural isotopic abundance (delta C-13 vs. delta N-15) in macroalgae-colonized habitats such as kelp forests and rocky shores previously evidenced the importance of the algal resource to support local and adjacent trophic webs mostly via the microbial detrital pathway. However, such bulk isotopic measures of natural abundances cannot inform precisely on the microbial actors and processes at play for the degradation of selected algal compounds. To overcome these limitations, we developed a stable isotope labeling procedure for cultures of the brown alga Laminaria digitata and tested its ability to yield labeled polysaccharides. Sporophytes of L. digitata were grown in controlled conditions for three months in seawater regularly amended with C-13-labeled sodium bicarbonate. Elemental analysis - isotope ratio mass spectrometry of algal specimens showed a significant enrichment after 10 days of treatment, reaching a maximum of At\%C-13 = 3.5321\% after 80 days. Sequential polysaccharide extraction from this labeled algal biomass allowed retrieving both alginate and fucose-containing sulfated polysaccharide fractions with high isotopic enrichment (At\%C-13 = 3.6279\% and 3.5868\%, respectively). This labeling protocol opens the way for future studies combining coastal ecosystems trophic interactions and microbial activities toward macroalgal biomass degradation.

TI  - Simulating CO2 leakages from CCS to determine Zn toxicity using the marine microalgae Pleurochrysis roscoffensis
AB  - Due to the current climate change and ocean acidification, a new technology for CO2 mitigation has been proposed, the Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS). However, there is an ecological risk associated with potential CO2 leakages from the sub-seabed storages sites. To evaluate the effects related to CO2 leakages, laboratory-scales experiments were performed using the marine microalgae Pleurochrysis roscoffensis. Five Zn concentrations were tested at different pHs to study Zn toxicity under acidified conditions. Seawater was collected and submitted to acidification by means of CO2 injection and by HCl addition. Results showed differences between both acidification techniques: while microalgae growth was enhanced by CO2 supply, reaching the optimal growth at pH 6.5 and full inhibition at pH 5.5, HCl acidification growth was inhibited at pH 6.5. Although small concentrations of Zn were positive for P. roscoffensis growth, Zn toxicity increased at lower pHs, and more severely on samples acidified with HCl. The conclusions obtained in this work are useful to address the potential effects on the marine ecosystem related to changes in metal bioavailability during CO2 leakages scenarios.

TI  - Macroalgal Blooms Trigger the Breakdown of Seagrass Blue Carbon
AB  - Intensive macroalgal blooms, a source of labile organic carbon (LOC) induced by coastal nutrient loading in some seagrass ecosystems, create ideal conditions for enhanced recalcitrant organic carbon (ROC) loss via the cometabolism effect. Here, we carried out a 62-day laboratory experiment to see if density-dependent addition of macroalgal biomass can influence the seagrass decomposition process, including seagrass detritus carbon chemistry, greenhouse emissions, and bacterial communities. We found that higher density macroalgal addition stimulated microbes to decompose similar to 20\% more of the seagrass biomass compared to other treatments, which was also reflected in enhanced (similar to twofold) greenhouse gas emissions. Although the composition of the seagrass-associated microbiome communities was unaffected by the addition of macroalgae, we showed that high macroalgal addition caused a relative depletion in the ROC as lignin and lipid compounds, as well as delta C-13 depletion and delta N-15 enrichment of the seagrass detritus. These results suggest that macroalgal blooms may stimulate the remineralization of recalcitrant components of seagrass detritus via cometabolism, possibly through providing available energy or resources for the synthesis of ROC-degrading enzymes within the resident microbial population. This study provides evidence that cometabolism can be a mechanism for leading to reduced seagrass blue carbon sequestration and preservation.

TI  - Blue carbon science, management and policy across a tropical urban landscape
AB  - The ability of vegetated coastal ecosystems to sequester high rates of ``blue{''} carbon over millennial time scales has attracted the interest of national and international policy makers as a tool for climate change mitigation. Whereas focus on blue carbon conservation has been mostly on threatened rural seascapes, there is scope to consider blue carbon dynamics along highly fragmented and developed urban coastlines. The tropical city state of Singapore is used as a case study of urban blue carbon knowledge generation, how blue carbon changes over time with urban development, and how such knowledge can be integrated into urban planning alongside municipal and national climate change obligations. A systematic review of blue carbon studies in Singapore was used to support a qualitative review of Singapore's blue carbon ecosystems, carbon budget, changes through time and urban planning and policy. Habitat loss across all blue carbon ecosystems is coarsely estimated to have resulted in the release of similar to 12.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide since the beginning of the 20th century. However, Singapore's remaining blue carbon ecosystems still store an estimated 568,971 - 577,227 tonnes of carbon (equivalent to 2.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide) nationally, with a small proportion of initial loss offset by habitat restoration. Carbon is now a key topic on the urban development and planning agenda, as well as nationally through Singapore's contributions to the Paris Agreement. The experiences of Singapore show that coastal ecosystems and their blue carbon stocks can be successfully managed along an urban coastline, and can help inform blue carbon science and management along other rapidly urbanizing coastlines throughout the tropics.

TI  - Field scale evaluation of seaweed aquaculture as a nutrient bioextraction strategy in Long Island Sound and the Bronx River Estuary
AB  - Nutrient bioextraction using Gracilaria tikvahiae McLachlan was tested at two sites: one off Fairfield, CT (LIS), and the other at the mouth of the Bronx River Estuary (BRE), during the summer and fall of 2011 and 2012. The estimates of nitrogen (N) removal by Gracilaria over a 90-day growing season were up to 28 and 94kgNha-1 at the LIS and BRE sites, respectively. In July 2012, Gracilaria grew up to 16.5%day-1 at BRE and 4.8%day-1 at the LIS site. Tissue N contents at the same periods were 3.7% (BRE) and 1.5% (LIS), respectively. These results demonstrate rapid assimilation of nutrients fueling the growth of new Gracilaria tissue at the BRE site, while nutrients appeared to limit growth at the LIS site during the summer months. The estimated C removal by Gracilaria at the BRE and LIS sites were up to 300kgha-1 (LIS) and 727kgha-1 (BRE), respectively. The potential economic values of N and C sequestration for the period examined in this study were as high as $311 (LIS) and $940ha-1 (BRE) for N, and $5.51 (LIS) and $13.32ha-1 (BRE) for C if seaweed aquaculture would be included in Connecticut's Nitrogen Trading Program. This represents a potential additional economic incentive for seaweed growers, beyond the direct value of seaweed products. The findings in this study showed that seaweed (Gracilaria) aquaculture can be a useful technique for nutrient bioextraction in urbanized coastal waters, such as the estuaries of New York City (BRE) and Long Island Sound.

TI  - Scaling up bioethanol production from the farmed brown macroalga Macrocystis pyrifera in Chile
AB  - Interest in third-generation biomass such as macroalgae has increased due to their high biomass yield, absence of lignin in their tissues, lower competition for land and fresh water, no fertilization requirements, and efficient CO2 capture in coastal ecosystems. However, several challenges still exist in the development of cost-effective technologies for processing large amounts of macroalgae. Recently, genetically modified micro-organisms able to convert brown macroalgae carbohydrates into bioethanol were developed, but still no attempt to scale up production has been proposed. Based on a giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) farming and bioethanol production program carried out in Chile, we were able to test and adapt this technology as a first attempt to scale up this process using a 75 L fermentation of genetically modified Escherichia coli. Laboratory fermentation tests results showed that although biomass growth and yield are not greatly affected by the alginate:mannitol ratio, ethanol yield showed a clear maximum around a 5:8 alginate:mannitol ratio. In M. pyrifera, a much greater proportion of alginate and lower mannitol abundance is found. In order to make the most of the carbohydrates available for fermentation, we developed a four-stage process model for scaling up, including acid leaching, depolymerization, saccharification, and fermentation steps. Using this process, we obtained 0.213 Kg ethanol Kg(-1) dry macroalgae, equivalent to 9.6 m(3) of ethanol hectare(-1) year(-1), reaching 64\% of the maximum theoretical ethanol yield. We propose strategies to increase this yield, including synthetic biology pathway engineering approaches and process optimization targets.

TI  - Characterization and hydrolysis optimization of Sargassum cinereum for the fermentative production of 3G bioethanol
AB  - Third-generation biofuels are gaining commercial interest because of the rapid growth rate, high productivity of nutrients, and the carbon dioxide sequestration ability of the feedstock, algae. But the selection of algae, cultivation method, and pretreatment techniques remain challenging. The present work describes the high suitability of brown seaweed as a promising feedstock for the production of bioethanol. Sargassum cinereum is a carbohydrate-rich and fast-growing brown seaweed in all marine environments and abundantly available in Gulf of Mannar, India. Proximate, ultimate, and biochemical analysis has demonstrated the potential carbohydrates in the brown seaweed composition. Preliminary studies on S. cinereum revealed that the H2SO4-assisted hydrolysis had produced more fermentable sugars than the tested. A statistical optimization method with 16 runs was employed to optimize the H2SO4 loading concentration (% w/v), residence time (min), and incubation temperature (Â°C) for the enhancement of fermentable sugars from the biomass. Optimization results have shown a 133% increase in reducing sugars yield. Furthermore, the obtained sugars were fermented to ethanol at a yield of 0.465 Â± 0.024Â g ethanol/reducing sugars using Saccharomyces cerevisiae MTCC170. The observed high ethanol yield from seaweed sugars was closer to the theoretical yield based on glucose as a substrate.

TI  - Introduction to marine bioenergy
AB  - Marine microalgae are currently considered to be one of the most promising alternative sources for biodiesel (Sheehan et al. 1998). Since many microalgal strains can be cultivated on nonarable land in a saline water medium, their mass farming does not place additional strains on food production (Widjaja et al. 2009). Their high photosynthetic rates, often ascribed to their simplistic unicellular structures, enable microalgae not only to serve as an effective carbon sequestration platform but also to rapidly accumulate lipids in their biomass (up to 77% of dry cell mass). Even using a conservative scenario, microalgae are still predicted to produce about 10 times more biodiesel per unit area of land than a typical terrestrial oleaginous crop (Sheehan et al. 1998; Chisti 2007; Rosenberg et al. 2008; Schenk et al. 2008).

TI  - Biocapture of CO2 from biogas by oleaginous microalgae for improving methane content and simultaneously producing lipid
AB  - This study aimed to use oleaginous microalgae to capture CO2 from biogas for improving methane content and simultaneously producing lipid. Several microalgae were screened for their ability to grow and produce lipid using CO2 in biogas. A marine Chlorella sp. was the most suitable strain for capturing CO2 and producing lipid using biogas (50% v/v CO2 in methane) as well as using 50% v/v CO2 in air. The medium and operating conditions were optimized through response surface methodology (RSM). The optimal concentrations of KNO3 and K2HPO4 were 0.80gL-1 and 0.06gL-1, respectively. The optimal operating conditions were: initial pH of 7.8, initial cell concentration of 107.5cellsmL-1, light intensity of 4500lux and gas flow rate of 0.03Lmin-1. After optimization, 89.3% of CO2 was removed from biogas and the methane content was increased up to 94.7%. The lipid productivity was 94.7mgL-1day-1. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Seaweed's Role in Energetic Transition-From Environmental Pollution Challenges to Enhanced Electrochemical Devices
AB  - Simple Summary Earth is currently facing the effects of climate change in all environmental ecosystems; this, together with pollution, is the cause of species extinction and biodiversity loss. Thus, it is vital to take actions to mitigate and decrease the release of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. The emergence of energetic transition from fossil fuels to greener energies is clearly defined in the United Nations 2030 agenda. Although this transition endorses the ambitious goal to supply greener energy for all developed societies, the increased demand for the minerals essential to develop cleaner energetic technologies has highlighted several economic and environmental issues. Currently, these minerals are mainly obtained by mining activities that generate high levels of soil and water pollution, coupled with the intensive use of water and hazardous gas release. On the other hand, the exponential increase of electronic waste derived from end-of-life electronic equipment is already raising environmental concerns due to heavy metal contamination as a result of their disposal. Thus, it is vital to develop sustainable and efficient strategies to mitigate energetic transition environmental footprints. This review highlights the use of seaweed biomass for toxic mineral bioremediation, recycling, and as an alternative material for greener energy-storage device development. Resulting from the growing human population and the long dependency on fossil-based energies, the planet is facing a critical rise in global temperature, which is affecting all ecosystem networks. With a growing consciousness this issue, the EU has defined several strategies towards environment sustainability, where biodiversity restoration and preservation, pollution reduction, circular economy, and energetic transition are paramount issues. To achieve the ambitious goal of becoming climate-neutral by 2050, it is vital to mitigate the environmental footprint of the energetic transition, namely heavy metal pollution resulting from mining and processing of raw materials and from electronic waste disposal. Additionally, it is vital to find alternative materials to enhance the efficiency of energy storage devices. This review addresses the environmental challenges associated with energetic transition, with particular emphasis on the emergence of new alternative materials for the development of cleaner energy technologies and on the environmental impacts of mitigation strategies. We compile the most recent advances on natural sources, particularly seaweed, with regard to their use in metal recycling, bioremediation, and as valuable biomass to produce biochar for electrochemical applications.

TI  - Utilization of centrate for the outdoor production of marine microalgae at the pilot-scale in raceway photobioreactors
AB  - In this study, the outdoor production of marine microalgae in raceway photobioreactors was investigated, modifying the centrate percentage in the culture medium (20, 30, 40 and 50%) and using two different dilution rates (0.2 dayâˆ’1 and 0.3 dayâˆ’1). The data obtained showed that microalgae are capable of producing biomass in addition to recovering the nutrients contained in the centrate. The best results for biomass productivity and light efficiency were obtained when the centrate was set at 20% with a dilution rate of 0.3 dayâˆ’1. The biomass productivity was 32.42 g mâˆ’2Â·dayâˆ’1 while the photosynthetic efficiency was 0.74 gbiomassÂ·Eâˆ’1 (3.66%). Regarding the nutrients, nitrogen (the majority being in the form of ammonium [NH4 +]) and phosphorus were only fixed into biomass when optimal conditions were set; if this was not the case, they were lost to stripping or precipitation. The maximal nutrient removal capacities under the optimal conditions were 28.72 mgNÂ·lâˆ’1Â·dayâˆ’1 and 3.99 mgPÂ·lâˆ’1Â·dayâˆ’1. Population changes were determined by the dilution rate set whilst the centrate percentage had little effect. Four strains were present in the culture, Nannochloropsis g. being the main one. Biochemical changes did not vary greatly between the conditions set for the culture, with a composition rich in proteins and carbohydrates being observed. One can conclude that to produce marine microalgal biomass for a range of potential commodities such as feed, biofertilizers and biofuels, it is possible to use centrate from anaerobic digestion as the sole nutrient source, as a way of reducing costs.

TI  - Effect of marine heat waves on carbon metabolism, optical characterization, and bioavailability of dissolved organic carbon in coastal vegetated communities
AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays an essential role in the global marine carbon cycle, with coastal vegetated communities as important DOC producers. However, the ultimate fate of this DOC remains still largely unknown due to the lack of knowledge about its chemical composition and lability. Furthermore, global change could alter both DOC fluxes and its bioavailability, affecting the carbon sequestration capacity of coastal vegetated communities. This study explores, in two contrasting seasons (winter and summer), the effects of an in situ simulated marine heatwave on carbon metabolism and DOC fluxes produced by seagrass (Cymodocea nodosa) and macroalgae (Caulerpa prolifera) communities. In addition, the fluorescent characteristics and biodegradability of the dissolved organic matter released directly by the communities under such conditions are evaluated. Under marine heatwave conditions, a significant increase in net community production (NCP) in C. nodosa and a shift to negative DOC fluxes in C. prolifera were observed. In control treatments, the seagrass-dominated community produced a substantial amount of labile (between 44\% and 58\%) and recalcitrant DOC (between 42\% and 56\%), while C. prolifera community produced mainly recalcitrant DOC (between 64\% and 87\%). Therefore, this research revealed that temperature is an important factor determining the NCP in benthic communities and the chemical structure and bioavailability of DOC produced by these communities, since both communities tended to produce more humic-like and less bioavailable DOC with increasing temperature.

TI  - Living textile biocomposites deliver enhanced carbon dioxide capture
AB  - Over 110 million tonnes of textile fibres and apparel are produced annually, ultimately ending with significant quantities of waste textiles. One route for upcycling end-of-life textiles is to repurpose the materials for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) removal by integrating microalgae (single celled photosynthetic organisms) to form â€˜livingâ€™ biocomposites. In this study we demonstrate the CO2 capture performance of prototype living algae biocomposites that use textiles as a solid substrate. Chlorella vulgaris was attached to 100% cotton and 100% polyester sheets, of which half were coated with kappa-carrageenan (a natural polymer derived from seaweed) as a gel topcoat to enhance microalgae retention. The biocomposites were investigated in 28 days semi-batch CO2 absorption tests using a 5% v/v CO2/air gas mixture. They absorbed significantly more CO2 than suspension microalgae culture controls, with the highest CO2 absorption rate being 1.82 Â± 0.10 g CO2 gâˆ’1biomass dâˆ’1 from the coated cotton biocomposites, followed by 1.55 Â± 0.27 g CO2 gâˆ’1biomass dâˆ’1 from the uncoated cotton biocomposites. The coated and uncoated polyester biocomposites had comparatively lower CO2 absorption rates (0.49 Â± 0.04 and 0.42 Â± 0.03 g CO2 gâˆ’1biomass dâˆ’1 respectively), likely due to the surface charges of the materials affecting microalgae adhesion and retention. A two weeks attachment test on cotton/polyester blends revealed some deterioration of the cotton which could limit the longevity of the biocomposites. Despite these issues, the CO2 abatement values compare favourably with other Chlorella CO2 capture studies with the added benefit of much reduced water usage and a reduced land requirement.

TI  - The interaction between DOC released by cultured kelp (Saccharina japonica) and the bacterial community reveals the potential for increasing marine carbon sequestration by macroalgae culture
AB  - Macroalgae culture as a marine carbon sequestration strategy has been recently proposed. To understand the potential for carbon sequestration by macroalgae culture, we studied the interaction of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) released by Saccharina japonica, an important cultured kelp species in China, and the bacterial community. We found that S. japonica effectively released DOC containing both labile and refractory components, and the DOC released by S. japonica into the water decreased average molecular weight (Mass(wa)) by 18 Da, meaning it was rich in low molecular weight matter. Degradation of labile DOC components occurred during the initial 2 months of the experiment. The Mass(wa) and molecular diversity of the DOC was increased in turn by bacterial degradation, and the variation in the DOC composition resulted in the succession of the bacterial community. During labile DOC degradation, anaerobic Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia and Campylobacteria were the dominant microbial classes in the water, and aerobic Iodidimonadaceae became the dominant family during the final stage of the experiment. Finally, 5\% of the DOC was transformed into refractory DOC. Although the sinking biomass was not involved in the study, the produced refractory DOC through the interaction between releasing DOC and bacterial degradation indicates a potential of carbon sequestration by macroalgae culture.

TI  - Synergetic approach for energy recovery from coastal wastes based on combination of biological and thermal treatment
AB  - Marine biomass is a promising renewable energy source, especially as this waste contains a large amount of cellulose and hemicellulose, which can contribute to convert it into energy products using anaerobic digestion (AD) and pyrolysis processes. This work was focused on a synergetic view of marine coastal waste treatment (seaweed) using two different technologies, anaerobic microbiological co-digestion, and pyrolysis. The experiments were performed with two merged technologies to assess the captured energy from the digestate in case it is contaminated. Anaerobic co-digestion was conducted using a periodic load laboratory bench with a vertical biogas digester. An evaluation of possible product yields and composition during pyrolysis at a laboratory-scale bench has been performed. The products obtained after the thermal treatment analyzed using an online gas measurement system and gas chromatographs Agilent 7890A with TCD detector (for gases) and Agilent 7890A with MS detector (for liquids). The results demonstrated that biogas yield was 174.1 l/kg (DM). Seaweed washed by seawater yields a higher amount of biogas (202.5 l/kg). Meanwhile, seaweed, sewage sludge, and digestate samples subjected to thermal treatment produced 17\%, 30\%, and 15\% of liquids products, respectively. The economic performance assessment showed that the application of the developed merged approach on an industrial scale could provide an economic return of up to 8.3 \$/100 kg of waste. Based on that, merged AD and pyrolysis technologies could be adapted as a promising technology to valorize seaweed wastes and utilize them as a new sustainable source for renewable energy.

TI  - Study of macro algae for marine biotechnology material from large scale offshore cultivation from multiple mooring system of large aquaculture ocean floating structure
AB  - Macro-algae farming have become one of the natural resources which are economically important. Macro alage are used as food in many Asian countries, and extracts for use as food additives (gelling agent, preservative etc.) and in other industries (textiles, pharmaceuticals, biomass energy etc.). The existing cultivation systems for macro-algae are not environmentally, socially and economically sustainable. Lack of suitable platform for large scale cultivation and potential coastline disturbance necessitates the need to develop novel deployment technology for deep and opens water cultivation. Macro-algae are useful biomaterial for food, food supplement, gels, solar cell, clean animal feeds, biomass energy, pharmaceutical, fracking product. To avoid mooring system failure, selecting an appropriate breaking strength and limit state for mooring lines is necessary, this paper describe multiple interacting mooring system design that account for forces and environmental loadings on the system. The paper describe evaluation of optimum mooring performance in wave, wind induced current loadings on mooring components, analysis of anchor, buoy, riser elements and compensator sinker that are involved in the multiple mooring system dynamics are presented. The paper also discuss establishment of appropriate safety factors and coefficient for the design of very large offshore aquaculture floating structure.

TI  - Carbon budget for a subtropical seagrass dominated coastal lagoon: How important are seagrasses to total ecosystem net primary production?
AB  - It has been assumed that because seagrasses dominate macrophyte biomass in many estuaries they also dominate primary production. We tested this assumption by developing three carbon budgets to examine the contribution of autotrophic components to the total ecosystem net primary production (TENPP) of Lower Laguna Madre, Texas. The first budget coupled average photosynthetic parameters with average daily irradiance to calculate daily production. The second budget used average photosynthetic parameters and hourly in situ irradiance to estimate productivity. The third budget integrated temperature-adjusted photosynthetic parameters (using Q(10) = 2) and hourly in situ irradiance to estimate productivity. For each budget TENPP was calculated by integrating production from each autotroph based on the producers' areal distribution within the entire Lower Laguna Madre. All budgets indicated that macroalgae account for 33-42\% of TENPP and seagrasses consistently accounted for about 33-38\%. The contribution by phytoplankton was consistently about 15-20\%, and the contribution from the benthic microalgae varied between 8\% and 36\% of TENPP, although this may have been underestimated due to our exclusion of the within bed microphytobenthos component. The water column over the seagrass beds was net beterotrophic and consequently was a carbon sink consuming between 5\% and 22\% of TENPP. TENPP ranged between 5.41 X 10(10) and 2.53 X 10(11) g C yr(-1), depending on which budget was used. The simplest, most idealized budget predicted the highest TENPP, while the more realistic budgets predicted lower values. Annual production rates estimated using the third budget for Halodule wrightii and Thalassia testudinum compare well with field data. Macroalgae and microalgae contribute 50-60\% of TENPP, and seagrass may be more important as three-dimensional habitat (i.e., structure) than as a source of organic carbon to the water column in Lower Laguna Madre.

TI  - Effect of marine heat waves on carbon metabolism, optical characterization, and bioavailability of dissolved organic carbon in coastal vegetated communities
AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays an essential role in the global marine carbon cycle, with coastal vegetated communities as important DOC producers. However, the ultimate fate of this DOC remains still largely unknown due to the lack of knowledge about its chemical composition and lability. Furthermore, global change could alter both DOC fluxes and its bioavailability, affecting the carbon sequestration capacity of coastal vegetated communities. This study explores, in two contrasting seasons (winter and summer), the effects of an in situ simulated marine heatwave on carbon metabolism and DOC fluxes produced by seagrass (Cymodocea nodosa) and macroalgae (Caulerpa prolifera) communities. In addition, the fluorescent characteristics and biodegradability of the dissolved organic matter released directly by the communities under such conditions are evaluated. Under marine heatwave conditions, a significant increase in net community production (NCP) in C. nodosa and a shift to negative DOC fluxes in C. prolifera were observed. In control treatments, the seagrass-dominated community produced a substantial amount of labile (between 44% and 58%) and recalcitrant DOC (between 42% and 56%), while C. prolifera community produced mainly recalcitrant DOC (between 64% and 87%). Therefore, this research revealed that temperature is an important factor determining the NCP in benthic communities and the chemical structure and bioavailability of DOC produced by these communities, since both communities tended to produce more humic-like and less bioavailable DOC with increasing temperature.

TI  - Biofixation of carbon dioxide (CO2) by microorganisms
AB  - Microbial biofixation of carbon dioxide (CO2) employs the capacity of autotrophic microorganisms, including photoautotrophs and chemoautotrophs, to fix CO2 for cell growth to reduce CO2 emission. In general, there are two approaches towards microbial CO2 sequestration: enhancing the biological productivity of autotrophs in their natural habitats (e.g., ocean fertilization) and cultivating autotrophic microorganisms in controlled systems (e.g., microalgal farming). This approach is effective, environment friendly and potentially sustainable. It is predicted that rapid technology development will make microbial CO2 bio-sequestration a practical approach in the near future.

TI  - Sedimentary Organic Carbon and Nitrogen Sequestration Across a Vertical Gradient on a Temperate Wetland Seascape Including Salt Marshes, Seagrass Meadows and Rhizophytic Macroalgae Beds
AB  - Coastal wetlands are key in regulating coastal carbon and nitrogen dynamics and contribute significantly to climate change mitigation and anthropogenic nutrient reduction. We investigated organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) stocks and burial rates at four adjacent vegetated coastal habitats across the seascape elevation gradient of CÃ¡diz Bay (South Spain), including one species of salt marsh, two of seagrasses, and a macroalgae. OC and TN stocks in the upper 1Â m sediment layer were higher at the subtidal seagrass Cymodocea nodosa (72.3Â Mg OC haâˆ’1, 8.6Â Mg TN haâˆ’1) followed by the upper intertidal salt marsh Sporobolus maritimus (66.5Â Mg OC haâˆ’1, 5.9Â Mg TN haâˆ’1), the subtidal rhizophytic macroalgae Caulerpa prolifera (62.2Â Mg OC haâˆ’1, 7.2Â Mg TN haâˆ’1), and the lower intertidal seagrass Zostera noltei (52.8Â Mg OC haâˆ’1, 5.2Â Mg TN haâˆ’1). The sedimentation rates increased from lower to higher elevation, from the intertidal salt marsh (0.24Â gÂ cmâˆ’2 yâˆ’1) to the subtidal macroalgae (0.12Â gÂ cmâˆ’2 yâˆ’1). The organic carbon burial rate was highest at the intertidal salt marsh (91 Â± 31Â g OC mâˆ’2 yâˆ’1), followed by the intertidal seagrass, (44 Â± 15Â g OC mâˆ’2 yâˆ’1), the subtidal seagrass (39 Â± 6Â g OC mâˆ’2 yâˆ’1), and the subtidal macroalgae (28 Â± 4Â g OC mâˆ’2 yâˆ’1). Total nitrogen burial rates were similar among the three lower vegetation types, ranging from 5 Â± 2 to 3 Â± 1Â g TN mâˆ’2 yâˆ’1, and peaked at S. maritimus salt marsh with 7 Â± 1Â g TN mâˆ’2 yâˆ’1. The contribution of allochthonous sources to the sedimentary organic matter also decreased with elevation, from 72% in C. prolifera to 33% at S. maritimus. Our results highlight the need of using habitat-specific OC and TN stocks and burial rates to improve our ability to predict OC and TN sequestration capacity of vegetated coastal habitats at the seascape level. We also demonstrated that the stocks and burial rates in C. prolifera habitats were within the range of well-accepted blue carbon ecosystems such as seagrass meadows and salt marshes.

TI  - Dispersed air flotation and foam fractionation for the recovery of microalgae in the production of biodiesel
AB  - Microalgae biomass has great potential for being used as feedstock for the sustainable production of biodiesel, as it is able to produce 7-31 times more oil than the top terrestrial crop. It is a green alternative to the currently utilized energy sources as it can reduce CO, CO2 and hydrocarbon emissions. However, downstream processing costs for the dilute biomass are a major challenge. Foam flotation has been recently investigated for the recovery of microalgae cells from dilute liquid suspensions. A number of variables on the effectiveness of foam flotation for microalgae have been investigated, which include surfactant type and concentration, cell concentration, pH, hydrophobicity, time, growth stage, flow rate, ionic strength, alkalinity, temperature, bubble size, and column size. It appears to be a promising method for the recovery of algae for biofuel production, as a result of the high removal recoveries, good enrichment ratios, ability to process large volumes of biomass, and its ease of operation. However, literature on this subject is scarce, and there are research gaps that should be investigated including characterization of microalgae cells and impact on foam separation and the effect of surfactant as a treatment prior to lipid extraction.

TI  - Detrital carbon production and export in high latitude kelp forests
AB  - The production and fate of seaweed detritus is a major unknown in the global C-budget. Knowing the quantity of detritus produced, the form it takes (size) and its timing of delivery are key to understanding its role as a resource subsidy to secondary production and/or its potential contribution to C-sequestration. We quantified the production and release of detritus from 10 Laminaria hyperborea sites in northern Norway (69.6 degrees N). Kelp biomass averaged 770 +/- 100 g C m(-2) while net production reached 499 +/- 50 g C m(-2) year(-1), with most taking place in spring when new blades were formed. Production of biomass was balanced by a similar formation of detritus (478 +/- 41 g Cm-2 year(-1)), and both were unrelated to wave exposure when compared across sites. Distal blade erosion accounted for 23\% of the total detritus production and was highest during autumn and winter, while dislodgment of whole individuals and/or whole blades corresponded to 24\% of the detritus production. Detachment of old blades constituted the largest source of kelp detritus, accounting for > 50\% of the total detrital production. Almost 80\% of the detritus from L. hyperborea was thus in the form of whole plants or blades and > 60\% of that was delivered as a large pulse within 1-2 months in spring. The discrete nature of the delivery suggests that the detritus cannot be retained and consumed locally and that some is exported to adjacent deep areas where it may subsidize secondary production or become buried into deep marine sediments as blue carbon.

TI  - Seaweed: A potential climate change solution
AB  - Climate change and environmental deterioration have spurred a blue carbon economic model in which fuel and food may be produced from marine ecosystems through the processes of carbon sequestration, carbon storage, and carbon harvest to substitute fossil products. This review discusses the potential of seaweed as a blue carbon sink and a renewable and sustainable energy source in the biogenic carbon cycle in the context of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. Data were collected from more than 100 scientific articles, reliable organizations, and industry resources to a concise explanation and novel perspective on how seaweed can contribute considerably to the newly emerging blue carbon economy and revolutionary tools to combat climate change in the long term. According to the findings, seaweed has all the features required to be classified as a blue carbon habitat and a massive carbon sink. Besides its function in climate change adaptation and mitigation, seaweed is also a prelude to attaining a bioeconomy by lowering the reliance on fossil fuel. Documented evidence supports various applications in sectors as diverse as human meals, livestock feed, biofuels, and renewable feedstocks. However, the literature also identifies barriers to the implementation of seaweed farming operations. This review provides evidence that seaweed farming and industries are potential alternatives for future energy, decarbonization, and food security, mitigating global climate change and attaining economic growth and sustainable livelihoods.

TI  - The air-lift photobioreactors with flow patterning for high-density cultures of microalgae and carbon dioxide removal
AB  - A photobioreactor containing microalgae is a highly efficient system for converting carbon dioxide (CO2) into biomass. Using a microalgal photobioreactor as a CO2 mitigation system is a practical approach to the problem of CO2 emission from waste gas. In this study, a marine microalga, Chlorella sp. NCTU-2, was applied to assess biomass production and CO2 removal. Three types of photobioreactors were designed and used: (i) without inner column (i.e. a bubble column), (ii) with a centric-tube column and (iii) with a porous centric-tube column. The specific growth rates (Î¼) of the batch cultures in the bubble column, the centric-tube and the porous centric-tube photobioreactor were 0.180, 0.226 and 0.252 day1, respectively. The porous centrictube photobioreactor, operated in semicontinuous culture mode with 10% CO2 aeration, was evaluated. The results show that the maximum biomass productivity was 0.61 g/L when one fourth of the culture broth was recovered every 2 days. The CO2 removal efficiency was also determined by measuring the influent and effluent loads at different aeration rates and cell densities of Chlorella sp. NCTU-2. The results show that the CO2 removal efficiency was related to biomass concentration and aeration rate. The maximum CO2 removal efficiency of the Chlorella sp. NCTU-2 culture was 63% when the biomass was maintained at 5.15 g/L concentration and 0.125vvm aeration (volume gas per volume broth per min; 10% CO2 in the aeration gas) in the porous centric-tube photobioreactor.

TI  - Carbon sink profile in cultured seaweed, Gracilaria changii for mitigation of global warming phenomenon
AB  - Background and Objective: Concern of environment due to global warming is one of the reasons for this study to be conducted. However, there are lacked of studies to mitigate this global problem. Therefore, this study was aimed to determine the carbon sink in seaweed, water and sediment from seaweed, Glacillaria changii culture. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in grow-out pond at Southern (Johor State) and Northern (Kedah State) of Peninsular Malaysia. The carbon content in water was determined using total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer, while combustion method using solid sample module (SSM) machine was used for sediment and G. changii samples. Results: The results showed that total carbon (TC), total organic carbon (TOC) and total inorganic carbon (TIC) in seaweed sample were higher in northern region as compared to southern region. This indicates that seaweed has high potential value in sequestering carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in environment which further can be used to mitigate the global warming effect phenomenon. Conclusion: Thus, G. changii are not only showed high economic value to the industry but also potentially play an important role as carbon sink which they can store carbon.

TI  - What do we know about the utilization of the Sargassum species as biosorbents of trace metals in Brazil?
AB  - In the last decades, metal pollution has become one of the most critical environmental and public health concerns. Human use and processing of trace metals have altered these metals' natural biogeochemical cycles, which is causing adverse impacts on human beings, natural communities, and aquatic ecosystems. In Brazil, mining and smelting are relevant metal contamination sources that affect many aquatic systems, besides agricultural residues, industrial and urban effluent discharges. In this context, seaweed biosorption is a promising technology for the removal of metals from wastewater that could prevent environmental contamination. Seaweeds show high metal sequestering capacities, cost-effectiveness, and eco-friendliness. In this review, we aimed to assess previous studies on trace metals biosorption using the brown seaweed of the genus Sargassum conducted in Brazil during the last two decades (1999-2019). An overview of metal pollution in Brazil and its possible treatments are presented. A theoretical basis regarding Sargassum and its mechanism of sorption of trace metals is described. We also discuss previous Brazilian studies on this topic, including their aims, the trace metals analyzed, and the experimental conditions that increase biosorption effectiveness, which include pH, temperature, algae pretreatment, and immobilization of the biosorbent in a matrix. Given the abundance of this genus throughout the Brazilian coast and its high metal recovering capacity, the algae sorption process remains an underexplored resource. We conclude this work with a patent search and a discussion of the future perspectives of Sargassum use by society.

TI  - Enhanced lipid productivity coupled with carbon and nitrogen removal of the diatom Skeletonema costatum cultured in the high CO2 level
AB  - Rising CO2 is causing noticeable environmental and social problems and thus to reduce CO2 emission is becoming extremely urgent. Biodiesel from microalgae is considered to have immense potential in replacing fossil fuels and reducing CO2 emission, apart from remediating eutrophic waters. How to increase biodiesel yield with low cost is the key for successful application of biofuel. In this study, we used high CO2 concentration (5\%) to culture the marine diatom Skeletonema costatum and aimed to enhance lipid productivity through the combination of low temperature shock. High CO2 first inhibited the specific growth rate but then increased it after a 24 h pause of gas supply. High CO2 increased lipid content by 26.8\% and lipid productivity by 29.0\%; the combination with low temperature shock resulted in a further stimulation (50.0\% for lipid content and 42.5\% for lipid productivity). High CO2 also stimulated carbon and nitrogen assimilation, leading to the increase of carbon and nitrogen removal rates by 28.9\% and 22.7\%, respectively; while low temperature shock did not show a significant effect. High CO2 increased maximum photochemical efficiency but reduced non-photochemical quenching, with insignificant effects of low temperature shock on either. Therefore, the stimulating effects of high CO2 on lipid accumulation could be attributed to increased photosynthetic performance because photosynthesis can supply ATP and carbon skeleton for lipid synthesis. These findings indicate the success of the combination of high CO2 and low temperature shock in enhancing algal lipid yield and bioremediation capacity.

TI  - Isolation and screening of indigenous microalgae species for domestic and livestock wastewater treatment, biodiesel production, and carbon sequestration
AB  - The use of indigenous microalgae strains for locally generated domestic (DWW) and livestock wastewater (LWW) treatment is essential for effective and economical applications. Phototrophic microalgae-based biofuel production also contributes to carbon sequestration via CO2 fixation. However, simultaneous consideration of both isolation and screening procedures for locally collected indigenous microalgae strains is not common in the literature. We aimed to isolate indigenous microalgae strains from locally collected samples on coastlines and islands in South Korea. Among five isolated strains, Chlorella sorokiniana JD1-1 was selected for DWW and LWW treatment due to its ability to grow in waste resources. This strain showed a higher specific growth rate in DWW than artificial growth medium (BG-11) with a range of 0.137â€“0.154 dâˆ’1. During cultivation, 96.5%â€“97.1% of total nitrogen in DWW and 89.2% in LWW was removed. Over 99% of total phosphorus in DWW and 96.4% in LWW was also removed. Finally, isolated C. sorokiniana JD1-1 was able to fix CO2 within a range of 0.0646â€“0.1043 g CO2 Lâˆ’1 dâˆ’1. These results support the domestic applications of carbon sequestrationâ€“efficient microalgae in the waste-to-energy nexus. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Characterization and hydrolysis optimization of Sargassum cinereum for the fermentative production of 3G bioethanol
AB  - Third-generation biofuels are gaining commercial interest because of the rapid growth rate, high productivity of nutrients, and the carbon dioxide sequestration ability of the feedstock, algae. But the selection of algae, cultivation method, and pretreatment techniques remain challenging. The present work describes the high suitability of brown seaweed as a promising feedstock for the production of bioethanol. Sargassum cinereum is a carbohydrate-rich and fast-growing brown seaweed in all marine environments and abundantly available in Gulf of Mannar, India. Proximate, ultimate, and biochemical analysis has demonstrated the potential carbohydrates in the brown seaweed composition. Preliminary studies on S. cinereum revealed that the H2SO4-assisted hydrolysis had produced more fermentable sugars than the tested. A statistical optimization method with 16 runs was employed to optimize the H2SO4 loading concentration (\% w/v), residence time (min), and incubation temperature (degrees C) for the enhancement of fermentable sugars from the biomass. Optimization results have shown a 133\% increase in reducing sugars yield. Furthermore, the obtained sugars were fermented to ethanol at a yield of 0.465 +/- 0.024 g ethanol/reducing sugars using Saccharomyces cerevisiae MTCC170. The observed high ethanol yield from seaweed sugars was closer to the theoretical yield based on glucose as a substrate.

TI  - Marine biomass
AB  - This paper surveyed technology for utilizing the energy of marine biomass. Recently there has been a sudden rise in societal interest in technologies for utilizing the energy in marine biomass, and active efforts are being made to develop technology using a variety of approaches. Marine biomass includes large seaweed, microalgae and marine product wastes, but the information here focuses on technology development for the first two. There are a variety of technologies for converting marine biomass to energy: "direct combustion" such as conversion to solid fuel; "thermochemical conversion" such as gasification via thermolysis; and "biochemical conversion" using biofunctions such as methane or alcohol fermentation. This survey discussed previous efforts, the current situation and future issues regarding these biomass types and technologies. Research on technologies for utilizing marine biomass has about a 40 year history, and research was active prior to 2000 in Japan as well as in Europe and the U.S. The authors believe that the results and clarification of issues achieved during that period will be crucial for accelerating technology development in the future. Regarding the field of ocean energy more generally, this paper went beyond the use of biomass to discuss the important contribution to be made by the field of marine biology in achieving practical application of ocean energy technologies.

TI  - Co-digestion of terrestrial plant biomass with marine macro-algae for biogas production
AB  - This paper investigates factors affecting anaerobic degradation of marine macro-algae (or seaweed), when used as a co-substrate with terrestrial plant biomass for the production of biogas. Using Laminaria digitata, a brown marine seaweed species and green peas, results showed that when only 2\% of feedstock of a reactor treating the green peas at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 2.67 kg VS m(3) day(-1) was replaced with the seaweed, methane production was disrupted, whilst acidogenesis, seemed to be less adversely affected, resulting in excessive volatile acids accumulation. Reactor stability was difficult to achieve thereafter. The experiment was repeated with a lower initial OLR of green peas of 0.70 kg VS m(3) day(-1) before the addition of the seaweed. Although similar symptoms as in first trial were observed, process stability was restored through the control of OLR and alkalinity. These measures led to an increase in overall OLR of 1.25 kg VS m(3) day(-1) comprising of 35\% seaweed. This study has shown that certain seaweed constituents are more inhibitory to the methanogens even at trace concentrations than to the other anaerobic digestion microbial groups. Appropriate adaptation strategy, involving initial low proportion of the seaweed relative to the total OLR, and overall low OLR, is necessary to ensure effective adaptation of the microorganisms to the inhibitory constituents of seaweed. Where there is seasonal availability of seaweed, the results of this study suggest that a fresh adaptation or start-up strategy must be implemented during each cycle of seaweed availability in order to ensure sustainable process stability.

TI  - The future of seaweed aquaculture in a rapidly changing world
AB  - Human activities are having increasingly negative impacts on the natural environment. The rapidly expanding human population has led to a shortage of resources and the ability to support the growing population sustainably is a major challenge for the future. Coastal environments, including natural seaweed communities, provide a range of important ecosystem services. Since seaweed aquaculture beds (SABs) provide many of the services associated with natural seaweed communities they have a potential role in providing solutions such as CO2 sequestration, provision of food and the supply of useful chemicals. However, the productivity of natural seaweed communities and SABs is under threat from the rapid changes in climate that the planet is experiencing. Here we examine the likely effects of global change, in particular elevated CO2 and ocean acidification, increased temperatures and elevated levels of UVB, on the performance of seaweeds. While it is clear that rising temperatures and elevated CO2 and their interactions with other environmental factors are likely to have profound effects on macroalgal production, such effects are likely to be species dependent. We also examine the fate of organic matter from seaweeds and the potential for using SAB productivity as a contributor to blue carbon as a strategy for amelioration of increases in anthropogenic CO2 emissions. There is considerable potential for increased drawdown of CO2 by SABs, though its effectiveness in amelioration of atmospheric CO2 increase will depend on the fate of the resulting biomass.

TI  - Coralline macroalgae contribution to ecological services of carbon storage in a disturbed seagrass meadow
AB  - Coralline macroalgae are globally distributed rhodopyhtes that remove carbon from their immediate environment and transform it into carbonate sediments through the senescence of their calcified tissues. In this study, the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) stocks in the tissue of Jania adhaerens and sediments in Tanjung Adang Shoal, Johor were quantified for a 13-month study period. The detailed maps of the geographical distribution based on the spatial and temporal variations of biomass and CaCO3 were also assessed. The highest amount of biomass, CaCO3 and organic carbon (OC) stocks in the tissues showed the highest in May 2018 and May 2019. The biomass values ranged from 65 to 143 g DW mâˆ’2, which contained 53â€“147 g CaCO3 mâˆ’2 and 3â€“11 g OC mâˆ’2. These findings provided insights into the biogeochemical cycling of these inputs, which can be used to estimate the overall carbon budget of the macrophyte meadow. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Open-air treatment of wastewater from land-based marine fish farms in extensive and intensive systems: current technology and future perspectives
AB  - Marine land-based fish farms located in coastal wetlands (salt-pond zones, lagoon banks, etc.), whether extensive or intensive, send farm effluents directly to the sea or after short periods of stocking in retention reservoirs. The aims of our investigation have been to compare the efficiency of current and potential water treatment procedures in open-air. Wastewater retention ponds in commercial farms (Atlantic coasts of France) are efficient in removing up to 1 metric ton of particulate material (dry weight) per hectare and per day (faeces and unconsumed feed), but are inefficient in reducing dissolved wastes, both organic (urea, amino acids, protein) and inorganic (total ammonia nitrogen, phosphates). Forthcoming outdoor technology to treat these forms of waste were examined by trials at different sites: treatment by foam fractionation in extensive systems (Italian fish pond culture), treatment by microalgae production (Skeletonema costatum) and oyster filtration (Crassostrea gigas) in intensive systems (sea bass farm, Dicentrarchus labrax). It can be concluded that foam fractionation coupled with aeration and water circulation is a good way to treat and recirculate wastewaters in extensive systems, but that a multiple treatment combining a retention pond, foam fractionation and microalgae-bivalve filtration, is the best solution to treat all these forms of wastes from intensive systems.

TI  - Climate-Friendly Seafood: The Potential for Emissions Reduction and Carbon Capture in Marine Aquaculture
AB  - Aquaculture is a critical food source for the world's growing population, producing 52\% of the aquatic animal products consumed. Marine aquaculture (mariculture) generates 37.5\% of this production and 97\% of the world's seaweed harvest. Mariculture products may offer a climate-friendly, high-protein food source, because they often have lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emission footprints than do the equivalent products farmed on land. However, sustainable intensification of low-emissions mariculture is key to maintaining a low GHG footprint as production scales up to meet future demand. We examine the major GHG sources and carbon sinks associated with fed finfish, macroalgae and bivalve mariculture, and the factors influencing variability across sectors. We highlight knowledge gaps and provide recommendations for GHG emissions reductions and carbon storage, including accounting for interactions between mariculture operations and surrounding marine ecosystems. By linking the provision of maricultured products to GHG abatement opportunities, we can advance climate-friendly practices that generate sustainable environmental, social, and economic outcomes.

TI  - Carbon sequestration in macroalgal mats of brackish-water habitats in Indian Sunderbans: Potential as renewable organic resource
AB  - Large influx of excess nutrients into sub-tropical brackish-water habitats is expected to radically affect the algal populations in the heavily populated Sunderbans brackish-water ecozone. Twelve selected brackish-water sites in the Indian Sunderbans were surveyed to investigate the growth performance of mat-forming dominant algal/cyanobacterial macrophytes and their potential for carbon (C) sequestration into hydrologic and pedologic pools. The mats were dominated by particular taxa at different seasons related to physico-chemical properties of the wet-land habitats. Different environmental variables and biomass productivity parameters were measured on fortnightly basis to assess the carbon cycle related to dominant algal blooms of the study area. The dominating species at the twelve sites included seven genera (Spirogyra, Rhizoclonium, Ulva, Cladophora, Pithophora, Chaetomorpha) belonging to Chlorophyta, three genera (Polysiphonia, Gracilaria, Catenella) belonging to Rhodophyta and Lyngbya majuscula from cyanobacteria. Multivariate statistical methods indicated that nutrient availability, particularly dissolved P concentration and N:P ratio in the water column, along with salinity in the water column mainly affected biomass yield and C sequestration of mat-forming macrophytes and OC input into water column. However, OC contents of underlying muck proved to be very stable, though small influxes of OC occurred at each bloom. High biomass yields (34-3107 g/m(2)) of the dominant mat components accumulated enormous stocks of OC, very little of which reaches the pedologic pool. This transient biomass might be utilized as dietary supplements or biofuel feedstocks. Availability of important dietary fatty acids in Spirogyra punctulata, Gracilaria sp., Polysiphonia mollis, Rhizoclonium riparium, R. tortuosum, Pithophora oedogonia and Ulva lactuca was considered as suitability of these species as nutraceuticals. Fatty acid compositions of L. majuscula, Catenella repens, R. tortuosum and Cladophora crystallina were estimated to be applicable for producing biodiesel for usage in sub-tropical climates.

TI  - Growth and photosynthesis by Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis (Gracilariales, Rhodophyta) in response to different stocking densities along Nan'ao Island coastal waters
AB  - Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis (Gracilariales, Rhodophyta) is an important economic seaweed in Southern China. Its use as an alternative source of bioenergy, novel source of bioactives and possible carbon sink has been investigated. The common economic driver of these applications is biomass productivity, which requires an understanding of the effects of different cultivation densities (mat density; 4, 8 and 12 g per cluster) for offshore `foaling raft' cultivation to maximise productivities. In the present study, the relative growth rate (RGR) and irradiance-saturated maximum photosynthetic rates (P-max) of thalli of G. lemaneiformis grown at high stocking density were lower than those of the algae grown at low stocking density. In three weather types (cloudy, overcast to clear and sunny conditions), the net photosynthetic rates (P-n) of the thalli grown at high stocking density were lower than those of the thalli cultivated at low density. The canopy P-n and increased algal gross biomass of the low-density algal mat were lower than those of the high-density algal mat The increased canopy P-n of G. lemaneiformis in the high-density algal mat decreased under cloudy conditions. We suggest that efforts should be devoted to achieving an appropriate stocking density to obtain a relatively high growth rate, photosynthetic productivity and gross biomass accumulation during G. lemaneiformis maricultivation.

TI  - Carbon sequestration in macroalgae Kappaphycus striatum in seaweed aquaculture site, Alaang village, Alor Island, East Nusa Tenggara
AB  - Carbon sequestration in macroalgae through photosynthesis can contribute to the mitigation of the climate change problem. This research aimed to analyze carbon sequestration potential on macroalgae Kappaphycus striatum with different harvested ages; i.e. young (25 days) and adult (60 days). Samples were collected randomly from off-bottom seaweed aquaculture system, at Alaang village, Alor island, East Nusa Tenggara. The parameter observed was carbon content determined by using gravimetric analysis. Growth rate measurement and light-dark bottle experiment were also conducted to be further analyzed. Results showed in total area 1,552 m2, it was estimated that the carbon sequestration potential of macroalgae Kappaphycus striatum was 13.28 tonnes C/cycle for young and 26.63 tonnes C/cycle for adult. These results were equal to 66.07 tonnes C/ha/cycle and 125.51 tonnes C/ha/cycle, respectively. Therefore, the carbon sequestration potential of adult seaweed was higher about 32.78% than that of young seaweed, followed by its lower growth rate and higher primary productivity. It can be concluded that the carbon sequestration potential was influenced by growth rate and primary productivity. Further study on sustainable management of seaweed aquaculture sites, by considering ecological and economic values, could potentially provide multiple functions both for human and ecosystem.

TI  - Potential growth and nutrient removal of Kappaphycus alvarezii in a fish floating-net cage system in Sekotong Bay, Lombok, Indonesia
AB  - There has been increasing interest in promoting the seaweed Kappaphycus alvarezii as a co-culture species in an integrated multitrophic aquaculture system. In recent work, we observed the capability of K. alvarezii to grow and remove carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) when planted in an intensive fish floating-net cage system in Sekotong Bay, Lombok, Indonesia. Environmental factors that may influence seaweed bioremediation were investigated. After 42 days, there was a significant difference in the seaweed growth and bioremediation capability while cultivated within the fish cage system compared to the control site. Six kilogram of K. alvarezii incorporated inside the fish cages reduced the inorganic NH4+ and PO43âˆ’ on average of 22.5â€“34% and 5â€“30%, respectively, from morning to afternoon and removed 131 g C g DWâˆ’1, 4.6 g N g DWâˆ’1, and 1.18 g P g DWâˆ’1. The seaweed growth rate inside the fish cages was 3.33% dâˆ’1 and higher than at the control site. Water motion was a limiting factor for growth and nutrient bioremediation inside the fish cage system. Our results provide evidence of the potential for K. alvarezii to grow in a fish aquaculture system and reduce the nutrient discharge from fish farms.

TI  - An examination of pelagic Sargassum community primary productivity and nutrient cycling in the face of Gulf Stream based energy
AB  - Pelagic Sargassum macroalgae entrained in the Gulf Stream serves as habitat for commercially and recreationally important fish and protected sea turtles, among other organisms. It also plays an important role in the sourcing of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus to the otherwise deficient oligotrophic pelagic waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Sargassum is seasonally concentrated along the western wall of the Gulf Stream off the coast of North Carolina. The Gulf Stream is a fast and constant western boundary current that consistently comes in close proximity to land off the coast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. This area is thus an area of interest for harnessing Gulf Stream energy. Gulf Stream turbines will likely be far removed from the surface of the water, and thus, the buoyant Sargassum that floats there. Nonetheless, the functional roles of Sargassum and its epibionts, including primary production and nutrient cycling, may be either negatively or positively influenced by Gulf Stream turbine wake. Our research, conducted in mesocosms, examined how an increase in turbulence affected the primary production and nitrogen fixation by Sargassum macroalgae and its associated epibiotic communities.

TI  - Reviews and syntheses: Hidden forests, the role of vegetated coastal habitats in the ocean carbon budget
AB  - Vegetated coastal habitats, including seagrass and macroalgal beds, mangrove forests and salt marshes, form highly productive ecosystems, but their contribution to the global carbon budget remains overlooked, and these forests remain ``hidden{''} in representations of the global carbon budget. Despite being confined to a narrow belt around the shoreline of the world's oceans, where they cover less than 7 million km(2), vegetated coastal habitats support about 1 to 10\% of the global marine net primary production and generate a large organic carbon surplus of about 40\% of their net primary production (NPP), which is either buried in sediments within these habitats or exported away. Large, 10-fold uncertainties in the area covered by vegetated coastal habitats, along with variability about carbon flux estimates, result in a 10-fold bracket around the estimates of their contribution to organic carbon sequestration in sediments and the deep sea from 73 to 866 Tg C yr(-1), representing between 3\% and 1/3 of oceanic CO2 uptake. Up to 1/2 of this carbon sequestration occurs in sink reservoirs (sediments or the deep sea) beyond these habitats. The organic carbon exported that does not reach depositional sites subsidizes the metabolism of heterotrophic organisms. In addition to a significant contribution to organic carbon production and sequestration, vegetated coastal habitats contribute as much to carbonate accumulation as coral reefs do. While globally relevant, the magnitude of global carbon fluxes supported by salt-marsh, mangrove, seagrass and macroalgal habitats is declining due to rapid habitat loss, contributing to loss of CO2 sequestration, storage capacity and carbon subsidies. Incorporating the carbon fluxes' vegetated coastal habitats' support into depictions of the carbon budget of the global ocean and its perturbations will improve current representations of the carbon budget of the global ocean.

TI  - Utilization of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel-burning power plants with biological systems
AB  - Physical-chemical processes for the capture and sequestration of CO2 from fossil fuel-fired power plant flue-gases are very expensive. Biological processes for CO2 utilization involve plant photosynthesis and conversion of the biomass to fuels, with no net CO2 production. Terrestrial plants cannot utilize flue gas CO2 directly. Only submerged aquatic plants, particularly microalgae, can utilize CO2 from power plant flue gases in a practical process. Microalgae have the potential for achieving high productivities and can be converted to gaseous and liquid fuels. A preliminary cost-analysis of such a process is presented that suggests that, if high productivities are achievable, overall costs would compare favorably with alternative physical-chemical processes for flue gas CO2 capture and sequestration, but would be higher than CO2 mitigation with terrestrial plants. Microalgae CO2 utilization systems would be most applicable where land and water (seawater, brackish) resources, not readily utilized by agriculture, are available. Â© 1993.

TI  - Economic analysis of microalgae biodiesel production in a small-scale facility
AB  - Industrial production and commercialization of biodiesel from microalgae have become a good alternative to conventional feedstock. Microalgae show high growth rate and carbon sequestration and can be easily cultivate in fresh and/or marine water, using non-arable soil. This study aims to analyze the technical and economic feasibility of biodiesel production from Phaeodactylum tricornutum, using an algae biomass production scaled-up scenario, considering local reality prices and available technologies. The model assumes 80,000 m(3) of microalgae cultivation, in a set of bubble column photobioreactors installed on 15.247 ha of land, reaching a total of 1,811 tons of microalgae biomass and 171,705 L of biodiesel per year. The production cost estimated for microalgae biomass is 2.01 (sic) kg(-1) and for biodiesel is 0.33 (sic) L-1. The ROI calculated for the project is 10\% with a 10 years' payback time and an EBITDA of 588,139 (sic) year(-1). Despite the project's viability in the medium term, the cost of producing microalgae biodiesel remains high when compared to fossil fuels. Thus, unless greater technological maturity is achieved to make the process more economical, it will not be viable in the short term. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Multi-Trophic Mariculture Practices in Coastal Waters
AB  - This chapter provides two case studies of integrated mariculture practices in Sungo Bay, China. One is integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) for sea ranching in subtidal zone, and the other is IMTA practiced for suspendied/floating mariculture in open waters. Marine fish cage farming releases organic and inorganic wastes into the environment, in the form of uneaten food, feces, and excretory products. In order to reduce the environmental impact of cage culture, 'extractive species' (e.g. bivalves, and seaweed) are cultured in conjunction with 'fed species'. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) is selected as the parameter to balance the seaweed absorption and fish production. The pilot IMTA project proved to be highly energy efficient, and optimized the carrying capacity of coastal embayment while improving water quality, increasing protein yields, and, through carbon capture, contributing to mitigation of the effects of climate change".

TI  - Sustainable seaweed cutting? The rockweed (Ascophyllum nodosum) industry of Maine and the Maritime Provinces
AB  - Burgeoning global demand for products derived from seaweeds is driving the increased removal of wild coastal seaweed biomass, an emerging low trophic level industry. These products are marketed as organic and ``sustainable.{''} Brown macroalgae, such as kelps (Laminariales) and rockweeds (Fucales), are foundational species that form underwater forests and thus support a diverse vertebrate, invertebrate, and algal community-including important commercial species-and deliver organic matter to coastal ecosystems. The measure of sustainability used by the rockweed (Ascophyllum nodosum (L.) LeJolis) industry, maximum sustainable yield, accounts for neither rockweed's role as habitat for 150+ species, including species of commercial or conservation significance, nor its role in coastal and estuarine ecosystems. To determine whether rockweed cutting is ``sustainable{''} will require data on the long-term and ecosystem-wide impacts of cutting rockweed. Once a sustainable level of cutting is determined, strict regulation by resource managers will be required to protect rockweed habitat. Until sustainable levels of cutting and appropriate regulations are identified, commercial-scale rockweed cutting presents a risk to coastal ecosystems and the human communities that depend on those ecosystems.

TI  - Microalgae: a promising tool for carbon sequestration
AB  - Increasing trends in global warming already evident, the likelihood of further rise continuing, and their impacts give urgency to addressing carbon sequestration technologies more coherently and effectively. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is responsible for over half the warming potential of all greenhouse gases (GHG), due to the dependence of world economies on fossil fuels. The processes involving CO2 capture and storage (CCS) are gaining attention as an alternative for reducing CO2 concentration in the ambient air. However, these technologies are considered as short-term solutions, as there are still concerns about the environmental sustainability of these processes. A promising technology could be the biological capture of CO2 using microalgae due to its unmatched advantages over higher plants and ocean fertilization. Microalgae are phototrophic microorganisms with simple nutritional requirements, and comprising the major primary producers on this planet. Specific pathways include autotrophic production via both open pond or closed photobioreactor (PBR) systems. Photosynthetic efficiency of microalgae ranged from 10-20 \% in comparison with 1-2 \% of most terrestrial plants. Some algal species, during their exponential growth, can double their biomass in periods as short as 3.5 hours. Moreover, advantage of being tolerant of high concentration of CO2 (flue gas), low light intensity requirements, environmentally sustainable, and co-producing added value products put these as the favoured organisms. Advantages of microalgae in comparison with other sequestration methodologies are discussed, which includes the cultivation systems, the key process parameters, wastewater treatment, harvesting and the novel bio-products produced by microalgal biomass.

TI  - Euendolithic Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria Together Contribute to Trigger Bioerosion in Aquatic Environments
AB  - Shellfish, mussels, snails, and other aquatic animals, which assimilate limestone (calcium carbonate, CaCO3) to build shells and skeletons, are effective carbon sinks that help mitigate the greenhouse effect. However, bioerosion, the dissolution of calcium carbonate and the release of carbon dioxide, hinders carbon sequestration process. The bioerosion of aquatic environments remains to be elucidated. In this study, the bioerosion of Bellamya spp. shells from the aquatic environment was taken as the research object. In situ microbial community structure analysis of the bioerosion shell from different geographical locations, laboratory-level infected culture, and validated experiments were conducted by coupling traditional observation and 16S rRNA sequencing analysis method. Results showed that bioeroders can implant into the CaCO3 layer of the snail shell, resulting in the formation of many small holes in the shell, which reduced the shell's density and made the shell fragile. Results also showed that bioeroders were distributed in two major phyla, namely, Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria. Cluster analysis showed that Cyanobacteria sp. and two unidentified genera (Burkholderiaceae and Raistonia) were the key bioeroders. Moreover, results suggested that the interaction of Cyanobacteria and other bacteria promoted the biological function of ``shell bioerosion.{''} This study identified the causes of ``shell bioerosion{''} in aquatic environments and provided some theoretical basis for preventing and controlling it in the aquatic industry. Results also provided new insights of cyanobacterial bioerosion of shells and microalgae carbon sequestration.

TI  - Gasification investigations of coal and biomass blends for high purity H-2 production with carbon capture potential
AB  - Biomass is carbon-neutral and has the carbon-negative potential if combined with carbon capture and storage (CCS). This study investigated the thermochemical conversion to high-purity hydrogen of a typical lignite (BYH) and seaweed biomass (BS) with carbon capture in a designed fixed-bed reactor at moderate conditions (1 atm, 873 K). High-purity hydrogen of 486.91-801.5 ml/g-blends with suppressed CO2 formation was produced in the alkaline gasification. The alkali can decompose the coal/biomass molecular structures, in-situ capture CO2 and control the gases to high-purity H-2 (80.1\%-93.2\%). The synergistic effect of coal and biomass changes the gas evolution behaviors and impacts the chemical structures of the char. The abundant SiO2 and Al2O3 in the coal can inhibit the catalytic activities of earth alkali metals in the biomass, but not much. These results are significant to the future development of low-carbon renewable energy techniques. (C) 2021 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Technological approaches to longline- and cage-based aquaculture in open ocean environments
AB  - As the worldwide exploitation rate of capture fisheries continues, the development of sustainable aquaculture practices is increasing to meet the seafood needs of the growing world population. The demand for aquatic products was historically satisfied firstly by an effort to expand wild catch and secondly by increasing land-based and near-shore aquaculture. However, stagnation in wild catch as well as environmental and societal challenges of land-based and near-shore aquaculture have greatly promoted efforts to development farming offshore technologies for harsh, high energetic environments. This contribution thus highlights recent technological approaches based on three sample sites which reach out from sheltered near-shore aquaculture sites to sites with harsh wave/current conditions. It compares and evaluates existing technological approaches based on a broad literature review; on this basis, we then strongly advocate for presently available aquaculture technologies to merge with future offshore structures and platforms and to unveil its added value through synergetic multi-use concepts. The first example describes the recent development of longline farming in offshore waters of New Zealand. New Zealand has designated over 10,000 ha of permitted open ocean water space for shellfish farming. The farms range from 8 to 20 km out to sea and a depth of 35-80 m of water. Research has been ongoing for the last 10 years and the first commercial efforts are now developing in the Bay of Plenty. New methods are being developed which should increase efficiency and reduce maintenance with a particular focus on Greenshell mussel (Perna canaliculus) and the Pacific Oyster (Crassostrea gigas), Flat Oyster (Tiostrea chilensis) and various seaweeds. The second case study involves a long-term, open ocean aquaculture (OOA) research project conducted by the University of New Hampshire. During the course of approximately 10 years, the technological aspects of OOA farming were conducted with submersible cages and longlines, surface feeding systems and real time environmental telemetry. The grow-out potential of multiple marine species such as cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus), blue mussel (Mytilus edulis), sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) and steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were investigated at a site 12 km from shore. The last study presents a multi-use aspect of aquaculture for an open ocean site with fish cages attached to existing offshore wind energy foundations. Technological components such as mounting forces and scour tendencies of two different cage structures (cylindrical and spherical) were investigated by means of hydraulic scale modeling. The cages were pre-designed on the basis of linear theory and existing standards and subsequently exposed to some realistic offshore wave conditions. The wind farm "Veja Mate" in German waters with 80 planned 5 MW turbines anchored to the ground by tripiles is taken as the basis for the tested wave conditions. Based on findings stemming from the three example approaches conclusions are drawn and future research demand is reported. Â© The Author(s) 2017.

TI  - Multi-generation System Optimization Compromising Water-Energy-Environment Nexus
AB  - Production of bioenergy and water by applying waste heat recovery system, capturing of CO2, cultivating of microalgae and RO-MD unit are examined in this chapter. In the first step of recovery, the flue gas output of gas turbine is fed into an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) and the produced electricity is sent to reverse osmose (RO) unit of and then to desalinate outlet brine of RO system, the membrane distillation (MD) is launched. In the next step to prevent releasing the CO2 of flue gas, the captured CO2 is used as a main agent to growth microalgae which including of three steps named as cultivation, harvesting and anaerobic digestion. Converting of cultivated algae to methane by anaerobic digestion process, biogas as a sustainable bioenergy source is produced and sent into combustion chamber to provide part of gas turbine system fuel. Energy, environment and economic analysis are carried out for proposed integrated ORC with RO and MD as well CO2 capture plant system and the effect of amount of flue gas fed to the algae production, ORC working fluid and seawater concentration on energy efficiency, levelized cost of freshwater and biogas production are investigated. Also, multi-objective optimization and sensitivity analysis are implemented from the economic and environmental points of views. Maximization of the annual profit and minimization the carbon dioxide emission per desalinated water production is defined as first and second objective functions of optimization process, respectively based on the environmental index.

TI  - Anaerobic co-digestion of marine macroalgae waste and fruit waste: Effect of mixture ratio on biogas production
AB  - Marine macroalgae waste (MMW) was used at different mixing ratios with fruit waste (FW) to evaluate the potential of co-digestion in enhancing methane yield. The process was conducted at mesophilic conditions (37 C) with a fixed amount of biomass (10 g, 3.5\% TS) and inoculum (150 mL; digested sewage sludge) and using MMW:FW ratios from 40:60 to 70:30. The results showed inhibition of the process for most of the studied substrate ratios, and in the mono-digestion of both substrates, possibly due to the accumulation of volatile fatty acids. A maximum biogas yield of 295 mL/g VS with 72\% of methane was however obtained for the 60MMW:40FW ratio, corresponding to an estimated maximum methane yield of 213 mL/g VS and around 46\% of the theoretical maximum methane production (49\% of organic matter removal). The results show that the co -digestion of MMW with FW enhances the methane yield of both independent substrates.

TI  - Farming the Ocean - Seaweeds as a Quick Fix for the Climate?
AB  - Finding ways to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius is urgent and will need a portfolio of solutions. Seaweeds are marine photosynthetic organisms that humans harvest either from the wild or farm, to be used in many applications and providing various ecosystem services. Large scale farming of seaweeds for absorbing carbon has lately been promoted as a climate ``fix{''}. The major shortcomings of this argument relate to the idea that a carbon sink function should exist through carbon accumulation in seaweed biomass simultaneously as seaweeds are consumed as food by humans, fed to animals, or used in many alternative applications. This carbon instead enters the fast carbon cycle and does not provide any ``carbon sink{''} function. Radical suggestions of intentionally transfer of farmed seaweeds to the deep-sea to accomplish a longer removal are highly questionable from feasibility, economic, ecosystem effects and ethical resource use perspectives. Development of ``ocean forests{''} for carbon capturing through farming should not be compared to forests on land as these provide carbon removal from the atmosphere at sufficiently long time scales to be qualified as carbon sequestration - thus making a difference related to reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Seaweeds can, however, play a role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the overall food system through carbon offset - i.e. if replacing food, feed, and/or materials that have larger carbon footprints. The fate/cycling of carbon as particulate and dissolved matter from both farmed and wild seaweeds, are however not fully understood, especially with respect to pathways and time scales relevant for carbon removal/storage. Another potential pathway for their role in decarbonization may be through reducing enteric methane emissions from ruminants and also through bioenergy production. More research is, however, needed for understanding the contributions from such interventions. Presenting seaweed farming as a quick fix for the climate risks facilitating misdirected investments (for carbon abatement solutions) and reducing demand for specific research and technological development that will be needed for increasing our understanding about seaweeds' contribution to food/feed systems and additional sustainability services and benefits.

AB  - Energy security is a serious concern for a sustainable economy where it has necessitated alternative renewable energy that can have the potential to meet the futuristic needs. Among renewable energies, carbon neutral biofuels frommicroalgae appear to be a promising move towards sustainability and cleaner fuels owing to its attributes of high CO2-sequestering capability, high lipid productivity and being easily cultivable in an open pond and waste/marine/brackish water. However, the commercial viability of algae-based fuels suffers mainly from the cost incurred during the process. Among the steps involved in the biodiesel production from microalgae, lipid extraction in particular consumes not only a significant amount of energy and time but also causes environmental contamination by usage of toxic solvents. Conventional solvents used in lipid extraction process may further aggravate the quality of the product by dissolving other compounds like chlorophyll that may lead to erroneous results of lipid content. To circumvent the problem, green solvents and process intensification methods/techniques (green extraction technologies) potentially improve the characteristics of energy reduction, eco-friendliness, non-toxicity and efficient lipid extraction. Hence, this review focuses on the prospects of green solvents and extraction techniques that could improve the commercial viability of biodiesel production. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

TI  - Modeling the Growth Potential of the Kelp Saccharina Latissima in the North Atlantic
AB  - It has recently been proposed that macroalgae (e.g., kelp) could be grown in the open ocean as a CO2 removal strategy. Most macroalgae naturally grow in shallow coastal waters, and their ability to grow in open ocean conditions is largely untested. Here we quantify macroalgae growth potential in the North Atlantic using an established model of Saccharina latissima forced by an ocean state estimate. In the relatively clear open ocean waters, we find that growth is possible to depths of up to 50 m across most of the region, with the maximum depth-integrated growth potential between 40 and 50Â°N. The model exhibits a large carbon to nitrogen ratio at the southern end of the growth range. The ratio of kelp carbon to phytoplankton biomass is also relatively high in the southeastern portion of the growth range. Using a sensitivity analysis, we find that the position of the southern limit of the growth range is largely modulated by temperature tolerance on the western side of the basin in the Gulf Stream and low nitrate on the eastern side of the basin. We also find a statistically significant reduction in the kelp growth potential over the period from 2002 to 2019, reflecting the warming of the surface ocean over this period.

TI  - Progress on the development of floating photobioreactor for microalgae cultivation and its application potential
AB  - Microalgae present great potential to replace land crops for the efficient production of large volumes of biomass for food, feed, fuels, and chemicals, as well as to treat wastewater and capture carbon. However, the commercialization of these technologies for bulk commodities requires a great reduction in the current microalgal biomass production cost. The bioreactor is the core of bioprocess engineering and is the premise for the commercial application of certain types of biotechnology. The challenges of phototrophic cultivation are completely different from those of heterotrophic processes because the efficiency of phototrophic cultivation is limited by the energy density of the input sunlight and the inorganic carbon supply. Thus, the development of microalgae cultivation technologies with low manufacturing and operating costs is key to addressing this problem, and floating photobioreactors (PBRs) are a promising solution. PBRs are deployed on the water surface without any land requirements, and wave energy provides free mixing energy. Additionally, the surrounding water can be used to control the culture temperature and to supply nutrients for microalgae growth. In this mini-review, the development of floating PBRs and their recent progress are presented. The effect of the carbon supply approach on the mixing and scaling-up of floating PBRs are critically discussed. The limitations and challenges in commercial applications of floating PBRs are analysed, and the need for future research is proposed. Finally, it is noted that microalgae farming on the ocean is a promising solution for human society to address the challenge of land space exhaustion due to the global population boom.

TI  - Cultivated seaweed carbon sequestration capacity
AB  - The rising of the earth's temperature and climate change have attracted the attention of many scientists and environmental experts. One of the main strategies being proposed to minimize the acceleration of the earth's temperature is to increase the potential of carbon sequestration from the atmosphere by taking advantage of the ability of plants, including algae, to utilize carbon dioxide in photosynthetic processes. This study aimed to estimate the carbon sequestration capacity and total carbon sequestration of macroalgae (seaweeds) commonly used in mariculture or in brackish-water pond (tambak) aquaculture. The study was conducted in August 2018 in South Sulawesi Province, Indonesia Carbon sequestration was estimated using the oxygen exchange method. Three maricultured seaweeds (Kappaphycus alvarezii green and brown strains and Eucheuma spinosum) and two pond-cultured seaweeds (Gracilaria verrucosa and Caulerpa racemosa) were studied. Thallus sections weighing 2.46-4.91 g were inserted into clear bottles (270 mL) filled with seawater and incubated for 3 hours (09.00-12.00), with 5 replicates for each seaweed. The bottles were attached to the seaweed culture lines (maricultured seaweeds) or placed in the ponds (pond-cultured seaweeds). Bottles filled with ambient water (containing phytoplankton) were used as controls. After 3 hours, titration was used to measure the oxygen exchange in each bottle, and the results converted into carbon sequestration. Seaweed productivity ranged from 0.660-11.997 mgCO2/gbk/hour with the lowest sequestration by K. alvarezii green strain and the highest by E. spinosum. Carbon sequestration was estimated at 57.64 tons CO2/ha/year for maricultured seaweed and 12.38 tons CO2/ha/year for pond-cultured seaweeds. The total annual carbon sequestration from seaweed cultivation in South Sulawesi was estimated at 2,656,625 tons CO2/year from mariculture and 621,377 tons CO2/year from pond culture.

TI  - Indigenous algae for local bioresource production: Phycoprospecting
AB  - Photosynthetic algae represent a large and diverse group of organisms that have only a limited history of characterization and exploitation. The application of resource production from algae is relatively untapped, with the potential to produce fuels, food, fibers and nutraceuticals on a large scale. Methods to screen for indigenous species of algae have improved and can allow communities to prospect for algae suited to regional needs. When cultured locally, indigenous algae are adapted to the prevailing regional abiotic and biotic factors. Native algae commonly inhabit local waste resources and pose no risk of becoming noxious invasives. Methods for culturing algae can utilize anthropogenic waste resources including wastewater nutrients and CO(2) from fossil fuel combustion. While genetic engineering may have a role in helping future algae production succeed, the majority of algae species have yet to be identified or characterized and the genetic diversity of these unknown species may offer significant but currently unknown benefits for bioresource production. Recalcitrant problems of culture stability, biomass density, harvesting, and product refining may be overcome by exploring native biological material. Selecting indigenous algae with intrinsic characteristics amenable to bioresource production and waste mitigation - phycoprospecting - is the most sustainable path forward for widespread algae-based bioresource development. Our recent efforts in phycoprospecting of local habitats revealed a diversity of algae with significant lipid content. (C) 2011 International Energy Initiative. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Implication of Macroalgal Bloom to Soil Organic Carbon Stock in Seagrass Meadows-A Case Study in South Hainan, China
AB  - The adverse impact of macroalgal blooms associated with nutrient enrichment on seagrass habitats and carbon storage potential is an ecological concern. In the present study, the soil carbon stock and sources were compared between a seagrass meadow where a serious macroalgal bloom occurred (site M) and an adjacent site without apparent macroalgae (site R) in a nutrient-enriched lagoon in South Hainan Island, China, to test whether macroalgal blooms associated with nutrient enrichment would impact the soil carbon in seagrass meadows. The soil organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen contents in the top 30 cm at site M were significantly lower than those at site R. The soil OC stocks (top 30 cm) were 3.4 and 5.4 Mg C ha(-1) at site M and site R, respectively, and no difference was observed between sampling stations with different distances offshore at either site. Soil delta C-13 was more enriched and closer to the delta C-13 of seagrass tissues at site R than at site M. Bayesian stable isotope mixing model analyses suggested that seagrass-derived material contributed \~{}50\% to soil OC at site R, while at site M, the contribution was reduced to \~{}25\%. The results suggested that macroalgal blooms associated with nutrient enrichment could drive the loss of seagrass-derived OC and the OC stock in the soil, which is worthy of full attention for blue carbon conservation.

TI  - UK macroalgae aquaculture: What are the key environmental and licensing considerations?
AB  - Macroalgae has numerous commercial uses and the potential to create large carbon sinks. The study reviewed the legal context, including environmental and social aspects, for the setting up of a seaweed farm in the UK. A lease is required to use the seabed and a Marine Licence is required from the national regulator. There is no need for new legislation, however, the existing guidance should be updated. There is a major need to clarify what level of assessment is required as part of the marine licensing process. The environmental and social considerations to licensing were also reviewed. Changes to the hydrodynamics and sediment transport are expected in and around the farm. These may lead to changes in seabed siltation and light levels. The addition of hard substrate (from the anchors) and a macroalgae canopy lead to attraction of benthic animals, fish, marine mammals and birds. These, in addition to potential changes in organic matter and nutrients reaching the seabed from exudate and detritus, could create changes in existing benthic communities on the seafloor. No reason for major population-level impacts were seen. However, numerous knowledge gaps where identified. Scale appears to be an impbrtant consideration. A small farm on its own is unlikely to have a large effect on the marine environment. However, a very large farm, or multiple small farms next to each other could have a more notable effect. Knowledge gaps were identified and recommendations were provided that can assist the development of the UK macroalgae farming industry.

TI  - Green Tides Significantly Alter the Molecular Composition and Properties of Coastal DOC and Perform Dissolved Carbon Sequestration
AB  - Despite green tides (or macroalgal blooms) having multiple negative effects, it is thought that they have a positive effect on carbon sequestration, although this aspect is rarely studied. Here, during the world's largest green tide (caused by Ulva prolifera) in the Yellow Sea, the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) increased by 20-37\% in intensive macroalgal areas, and thousands of new molecular formulas rich in CHNO and CHOS were introduced. The DOC molecular species derived from U. prolifera constituted similar to 18\% of the total DOC molecular species in the seawater of bloom area, indicating the profound effect that green tides have on shaping coastal DOC. In addition, 46\% of the macroalgae-derived DOC was labile DOC (LDOC), which had only a short residence time due to rapid microbial utilization. The remaining 54\% was recalcitrant DOC (RDOC) rich in humic-like substances, polycyclic aromatics, and highly aromatic compounds that resisted microbial degradation and therefore have the potential to play a role in long-term carbon sequestration. Notably, source analysis showed that in addition to the microbial carbon pump, macroalgae are also an important source of RDOC. The number of RDOC molecular species contributed by macroalgae even exceed (77 vs 23\%) that contributed by microorganisms.

TI  - The industrial ecology of freshwater macroalgae for biomass applications
AB  - Industrial ecology is focused on recognising the inherent value inwaste streams and developing techniques that can efficiently recover this value. Freshwater macroalgae can become a foundation of this concept as they can be cultured in a range of waste streams where they can effectively remove excess nutrients, metals and metalloids, providing both a bioremediation service and a biomass resource. The cultured algal biomass can then be used as a product in animal feeds, biochar, biosorbents or as a feedstock biomass for the production of bioenergy. Freshwatermacroalgae provide a unique opportunity to transforma range of industries through the utilisation of wastewater to produce biomass that can be converted into valuable bioproducts.

TI  - A Review: CO2 Utilization
AB  - Global warming due to the accumulation of atmospheric CO2 has received widespread attention in recent years. Although various CO2 capture technologies have been proposed, using the captured CO2 from power plants is increasingly popular because of concerns with regard to the safety of underground and ocean CO2 storage. Various techniques related to utilization of CO2 from the exhausted gas of power plants are discussed in this article. The existing and under-development technologies for CO2 utilization in the world are briefly reviewed. Two categories, direct utilization of CO2 and conversion of CO2 to chemicals and energy products, are used to classify different forms of CO2 utilization. Regarding the direct utilization of CO2, in addition to its use in soft drinks, welding, foaming, and propellants, as well as the use of supercritical CO2 as a solvent, CO2 capture via photosynthesis to directly fix carbon into microalgae has also attracted the attention of researchers. The conversion of CO2 into chemicals and energy products via this approach is a promising way to not only reduce the CO2 emissions, but also generate more economic value. Since CO2 is just a source of carbon without hydrogen, a clean, sustainable and cheap source of hydrogen should be developed. This article reviews the literature on the production of biofuel from microalgae cultivated using captured CO2, the conversion of CO2 with hydrogen to chemicals and energy products, and sustainable and clean sources of hydrogen, in order to demonstrate the potential of CO2 utilization.

TI  - Emerging microalgae-based technologies in biorefinery and risk assessment issues: Bioeconomy for sustainable development
AB  - Industrial wastewater treatment is of paramount importance considering the safety of the aquatic ecosystem and its associated health risk to humankind inhabiting near the water bodies. Microalgae-based technologies for remediation of environmental pollutants present avenues for bioenergy applications and production of value-added biochemicals having pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, antioxidants, carbohydrate, phenolics, long-chain multi-faceted fatty acids, enzymes, and proteins which are considered healthy supplements for human health. Such a wide range of products put up a good case for the biorefinery concept. Microalgae play a pivotal role in degrading complex pollutants, such as organic and inorganic contaminants thereby efficiently removing them from the environment. In addition, microalgal species, such as Botryococcus braunii, Tetraselmis suecica, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Neochloris oleoabundans, Chlorella vulgaris, Arthrospira, Chlorella, and Tetraselmis sp., etc., are also reported for generation of value-added products. This review presents a holistic view of microalgae based biorefinery starting from cultivation and harvesting of microalgae, the potential for remediation of environmental pollutants, bioenergy application, and production of value-added biomolecules. Further, it summarizes the current understanding of microalgae-based technologies and discusses the risks involved, potential for bioeconomy, and outlines future research directions.

TI  - Variation of carbon contents in eelgrass (Zostera marina) sediments implied from depth profiles
AB  - Seagrass meadows are able to store significant amounts of organic carbon in their underlying sediment, but global estimates are uncertain partly owing to spatio-temporal heterogeneity between and within areas and species. In order to provide robust estimates, there is a need to better understand the fate of, and mechanisms behind, organic carbon storage. In this observational study, we analyse a suite of biotic and abiotic parameters in sediment cores from 47 different eelgrass (Zostera marina) beds spanning the distributional range of the Northern Hemisphere. Depth profiles of particulate organic carbon (POC) revealed three patterns of vertical distribution where POC either increased, decreased or showed no pattern with sediment depth. These categories exhibited distinct profiles of delta C-13 and C:N ratios, where high POC profiles had a proportionally larger storage of eelgrass-derived material whereas low POC profiles were dominated by phytoplanktonic and macroalgal material. However, high POC did not always translate into high carbon density. Nevertheless, this large-scale dataset provides evidence that the variability in organic matter source in response to natural and anthropogenic environmental changes affects the potential role of eelgrass beds as POC sinks, particularly where eelgrass decline is observed.

TI  - Hydrogen production by the thermophilic eubacterium Thermotoga neapolitana from storage polysaccharides of the CO2-fixing diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii
AB  - Planktic diatoms are the largest primary producers in marine and freshwater habitats. Their dry biomass accumulates up to 50\% of lipids and contains water-soluble beta-1,3-glucans as major storage products. Because of the world-wide abundance of these photosynthetic protists, beta-1,3-glucans may rival cellulose as the polysaccharide with the highest annual production on Earth. Here we show the feasibility of a simple and efficient process leading to bio-hydrogen by dark fermentation of microalgal biomass with the thermophilic bacterium Thermotoga neapolitana. Production of the biogas on minimum medium supplemented only with the extract of the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii proved that algal biomass per se can serve as substrate for sustaining the biotechnological process with no requirement of any pretreatment and external integration of other nutrients. At the same time, lipids unused for the anaerobic production of the biogas, can be employed for production of bio-diesel, thus considerably increasing the economic potential of these renewable feedstocks.

TI  - Ocean acidification and hypoxia alter organic carbon fluxes in marine soft sediments
AB  - Anthropogenic stressors can alter the structure and functioning of infaunal communities, which are key drivers of the carbon cycle in marine soft sediments. Nonetheless, the compounded effects of anthropogenic stressors on carbon fluxes in soft benthic systems remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the cumulative effects of ocean acidification (OA) and hypoxia on the organic carbon fate in marine sediments, through a mesocosm experiment. Isotopically labelled macroalgal detritus (C-13) was used as a tracer to assess carbon incorporation in faunal tissue and in sediments under different experimental conditions. In addition, labelled macroalgae (C-13), previously exposed to elevated CO2, were also used to assess the organic carbon uptake by fauna and sediments, when both sources and consumers were exposed to elevated CO2. At elevated CO2, infauna increased the uptake of carbon, likely as compensatory response to the higher energetic costs faced under adverse environmental conditions. By contrast, there was no increase in carbon uptake by fauna exposed to both stressors in combination, indicating that even a short-term hypoxic event may weaken the ability of marine invertebrates to withstand elevated CO2 conditions. In addition, both hypoxia and elevated CO2 increased organic carbon burial in the sediment, potentially affecting sediment biogeochemical processes. Since hypoxia and OA are predicted to increase in the face of climate change, our results suggest that local reduction of hypoxic events may mitigate the impacts of global climate change on marine soft-sediment systems.

TI  - Blue Growth Potential to Mitigate Climate Change through Seaweed Offsetting
AB  - Carbon offsetting-receiving credit for reducing, avoiding, or sequestering carbon-has become part of the portfolio of solutions to mitigate carbon emissions, and thus climate change, through policy and voluntary markets, primarily by land-based re- or afforestation and preservation {[}1, 2]. However, land is limiting, creating interest in a rapidly growing aquatic farming sector of seaweed aquaculture {[}3-5]. Synthesizing data from scientific literature, we assess the extent and cost of scaling seaweed aquaculture to provide sufficient CO(2)eq sequestration for several climate change mitigation scenarios, with a focus on the food sector-a major source of greenhouse gases {[}6]. Given known ecological constraints (nutrients and temperature), we found a substantial suitable area (ca. 48 million km(2)) for seaweed farming, which is largely unfarmed. Within its own industry, seaweed could create a carbon-neutral aquaculture sector with just 14\% (mean = 25\%) of current seaweed production (0.001\% of suitable area). At a much larger scale, we find seaweed culturing extremely unlikely to offset global agriculture, in part due to production growth and cost constraints. Yet offsetting agriculture appears more feasible at a regional level, especially areas with strong climate policy, such as California (0.065\% of suitable area). Importantly, seaweed farming can provide other benefits to coastlines affected by eutrophic, hypoxic, and/or acidic conditions {[}7, 8], creating opportunities for seaweed farming to act as ``charismatic carbon{''} that serves multiple purposes. Seaweed offsetting is not the sole solution to climate change, but it provides an invaluable new tool for a more sustainable future.

TI  - Pollutants from fish feeding recycled for microalgae production as sustainable, renewable and valuable products
AB  - Trash fish feeding of cage fish can result in marine pollution. Whole and chopped trash fish can leach pollutants such as ammonia, phosphate and protein into surrounding waters. Reduction of pollution can be achieved by recycling the wastewater generated from trash fish feeding for cultivation of microalgae. Microalgae are potent candidates for the production of renewable and sustainable products such as feed and food, health and pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical, industrial products, and biofuel. Two microalgae, Chlorella saccharophila and Nannochloropsis sp., have the potential to produce high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Furthermore, high oil content ranging from 10.7 to 13.6% is found in Chlorella saccharophila and up to 9.3% for Nannochloropsis sp. Moreover, these microalgae can also be utilized as a biofuel to give a mean calorific value of 5364 Cal/g which is higher than that of wood for Chlorella saccharophila and 6132 Cal/g which is equivalent to that of coal for Nannochloropsis sp. An alternative biofuel derived from microalgae is feasible due to the fact that they do not compete for arable land for cultivation and land crops for feed and food. This study discusses the synergistic coupling of microalgae mass production with wastewater treatment and carbon sequestration potential for mitigation of environmental impacts and a technically viable alternative energy resource. Additionally, the de-oiled biomass byproduct after oil extraction or its whole biomass can be converted into sustainable and renewal industrial products such as bioplastic, biopaint, bioasphalt, and biobuilding components.

TI  - High spatiotemporal variability of methane concentrations challenges estimates of emissions across vegetated coastal ecosystems
AB  - Coastal methane (CH4) emissions dominate the global ocean CH4 budget and can offset the ``blue carbon{''} storage capacity of vegetated coastal ecosystems. However, current estimates lack systematic, high-resolution, and long-term data from these intrinsically heterogeneous environments, making coastal budgets sensitive to statistical assumptions and uncertainties. Using continuous CH4 concentrations, delta C-13-CH4 values, and CH4 sea-air fluxes across four seasons in three globally pervasive coastal habitats, we show that the CH4 distribution is spatially patchy over meter-scales and highly variable in time. Areas with mixed vegetation, macroalgae, and their surrounding sediments exhibited a spatiotemporal variability of surface water CH4 concentrations ranging two orders of magnitude (i.e., 6-460 nM CH4) with habitat-specific seasonal and diurnal patterns. We observed (1) delta C-13-CH signatures that revealed habitat-specific CH4 production and consumption pathways, (2) daily peak concentration events that could change >100\% within hours across all habitats, and (3) a high thermal sensitivity of the CH4 distribution signified by apparent activation energies of similar to 1 eV that drove seasonal changes. Bootstrapping simulations show that scaling the CH4 distribution from few samples involves large errors, and that similar to 50 concentration samples per day are needed to resolve the scale and drivers of the natural variability and improve the certainty of flux calculations by up to 70\%. Finally, we identify northern temperate coastal habitats with mixed vegetation and macroalgae as understudied but seasonally relevant atmospheric CH4 sources (i.e., releasing >= 100 mu mol CH4 m(-2) day(-1) in summer). Due to the large spatial and temporal heterogeneity of coastal environments, high-resolution measurements will improve the reliability of CH4 estimates and confine the habitat-specific contribution to regional and global CH4 budgets.

TI  - Evaluation of carbon flux in vegetative bay based on ecosystem production and CO2 exchange driven by coastal autotrophs
AB  - Studies on carbon flux in the oceans have been highlighted in recent years due to increasing awareness about climate change, but the coastal ecosystem remains one of the unexplored fields in this regard. In this study, the dynamics of carbon flux in a vegetative coastal ecosystem were examined by an evaluation of net and gross ecosystem production (NEP and GEP) and CO2 exchange rates (net ecosystem exchange, NEE). To estimate NEP and GEP, community production and respiration were measured along different habitat types (eelgrass and macroalgal beds, shallow and deep sedimentary, and deep rocky shore) at Gwangyang Bay, Korea from 20 June to 20 July 2007. Vegetative areas showed significantly higher ecosystem production than the other habitat types. Specifically, eelgrass beds had the highest daily GEP (6.97 +/- 0.02 g C m(-2) d(-1)), with a large amount of biomass and high productivity of eelgrass, whereas the outer macroalgal vegetation had the lowest GEP (0.97 +/- 0.04 g C m(-2) d(-1)). In addition, macroalgal vegetation showed the highest daily NEP (3.31 +/- 0.45 g C m(-2) d(-1)) due to its highest P : R ratio (2.33). Furthermore, the eelgrass beds acted as a CO2 sink through the air-seawater interface according to NEE data, with a carbon sink rate of 0.63 mg C m(-2) d(-1). Overall, ecosystem production was found to be extremely high in the vegetated systems (eelgrass and macroalgal beds), which occupy a relatively small area compared to the unvegetated systems according to our conceptual diagram of a carbon-flux box model. These results indicate that the vegetative ecosystems showed significantly high capturing efficiency of inorganic carbon through coastal primary production.

TI  - Assessment of carbon sequestration potential of algae of a Ramsar site in Pakistan â€” Uchalli Wetland Complex
AB  - Algae has a great CO2 biofixation potential that plays crucial role in regulating global carbon cycle and sustaining the ecology. Biosequestration of carbon is more efficient, sustainable, and has broader spectrum than its sequestration via various synthetic means. This study has analyzed the carbon sequestration potential of algae of Uchalli Wetland Complex (UWC) to mimic the natural microalgae function to realize the ecological significance of the complex being an important Ramsar site. The microalgal mats/colonies were sampled from three lakes, i.e., Khabeki, Uchalli, and Jahlar lakes, for consecutive eight months with an interval of 30Â days to determine the carbon sequestration potential of the UWC. Maximum percentages of carbon (25.33â€“31.55%), hydrogen (3.86â€“4.68%), and nitrogen (2.9â€“3.45%) in the microalgal mats of Jahlar Lake, whereas highest sulfur content (5.9â€“7.42%) was observed in microalgal colonies of Khabeki Lake. Growth kinetics depicts maximum biomass productivity (4.5 Ã— 106 avg.) in September while maximum CO2 sequestration (75.7Â gâˆ’2Â monthâˆ’1) is detected in algal mats of Uchalli Lake. This study explored an undiscovered carbon sequestering potential of about 108.6Â gâˆ’2Â monthâˆ’1 of algae of UWC that is certainly assistive in combating the climate change. Pearsonâ€™s correlation generated significant relationships among different studied parameters at 0.01 and 0.05 levels. Statistical analysis by ANOVA with respect to lakes showed significant values (p = 0.000â€“0.003) of pH, salinity, carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, sulfur, CO2 fixed, C/N, and C/H.

TI  - Hydrothermal carbonization (Htc) of seaweed (macroalgae) for producing hydrochar
AB  - Waste seaweed that is collected at coastal regions of maritime provinces in Canada is creating ecological problems as it promotes an anoxic event, which produces nearly zero dissolved oxygen in water along with hydrogen sulfide emission. The work done in this study attempts to address this issue by producing a coal-like solid hydrochar and nutritious liquid slurry (processed water) by employing a rather recent thermo-chemical process called hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) on the seaweed. The HTC was carried out in a batch reactor system for three different reaction temperatures, 180â—¦ C, 200â—¦ C, 220â—¦ C, and three different reaction times, 30, 60, and 120 min. Each of the produced hydrochars was characterized by different analytical methods. The effects of the process conditions on the yield and the properties of the hydrochar and process water were examined. The hydrochar produced at 220â—¦ C and 120 min showed the highest carbon content (48.5%) and heating value (18.93 MJ/kg). The energy density and carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio in the hydrochar increased significantly as compared to raw seaweed. Moreover, HTC reduced the ash yield and volatile compounds of the seaweed. Thus, hydrochar can be used as a fuel for direct combustion, in soil remediation, or in carbon sequestration applications. Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Chemical mutation method for high CO2-requiring- mutants of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002
AB  - High carbon dioxide and others greenhouse gas emissions have caused the increasing of global temperature, leading to a significant rise in sea level, thus, disturbing the balance of ecosystems. These have encouraged researchers to explore several methods to reduce and mitigate CO2 from atmosphere and one of the methods is by using microalgae to capture and utilize CO2 from atmosphere or directly from flue gas. This biological method is economically feasible and environmentally sustainable alternative technology as the CO2 will be consumed during photosynthesis, thus released oxygen and produced valuable biological products. Numerous studies on mutagenesis of cyanobacteria have greatly emerged purposely to change their genetic material specifically by altering the mechanism in cyanobacteria in order to increase the ability for carbon dioxide uptake. One of the mutagenesis methods is by random mutagenesis using chemical mutagen. It has been proven to be able to produce high CO2-requiring-mutant of cyanobacteria. In this chapter, a modified of chemical mutation method using ethyl methanesulfonate based on Price and Badger (1989), is presented to randomly mutated Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002.

TI  - Microalgal Biomass: A Biorefinery Approach
AB  - The biorefinery concept has been identified as the most promising way to create a biomass-based industry, which can be defined as the sustainable biomass processing to obtain energy biofuels and high-value products through processes and equipment for biomass. Microalgae can be used as an efficient and economically viable biorefinery feedstock; microalgae could be used in different areas such as human and animal nutrition, nutraceutical and therapeutic products, fertilizers, plastics, isoprenes and biofuels and also in the treatment of wastewaters and CO2 capture. Microalgae biomass can be used for biofuel production, such as bioelectricity, methane, biohydrogen, bioethanol and biodiesel. In this chapter, an overview of the factors that affect the production of the microalgal biomass yield and value-added by-products production is presented. Likewise, we present the results of the microalgal culture of Scenedesmus sp. SCX2 performed in semicontinuous culture (SCC), in 2000 raceway ponds employing Bold's Basal Medium (BBM), under greenhouse conditions. Over the SCC, we monitored biomass concentration, lipid, protein, pigments and sugar production, light irradiance, culture and greenhouse temperature and nitrate concentration in the medium.

TI  - The biomass quality of algae used for CO2 sequestration is highly species-specific and may vary over time
AB  - The utilization of microalgae to temporarily sequester CO2 is a hot topic in algal biotechnology. Its association with biomass utilization is often proposed to increase economical revenues. Although C allocation patterns may determine the success or failure of such use of algae, the impact of elevated CO2 on biomass quality has not been investigated systematically. In this study, four algae of different taxonomy and mode of inorganic carbon acquisition were subjected to a transition from low (390 mu L L-1) to elevated (1,000 mu L L-1) pCO(2). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, a rapid, nonextractive, and reliable technique, was used to attain the necessary information on all main organic pools concomitantly and with no need for extractive procedures. Cell organic composition was analyzed after 24 hours and 20 days since the transition. The responses were very species-specific, and the biomass quality was modified over time, indicating that species selection and monitoring of biomass are essential for an adequate control on the quality of the product. Although these concepts may have been in the mind of the illuminated algae users, the experimental evidence is essentially nonexisting. We intended to make a first step towards filling this gap in knowledge.

TI  - Cattle, climate and complexity: food security, quality and sustainability of the Australian cattle industries
AB  - Background: Marked increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations are largely associated with the release of sequestered carbon in fossil fuels. While emissions of green-house gasses (GHG) from cattle have significant global warming potential, these are biogenic sources and substantially involve carbon in natural cycles, rather than fossil fuel. Cattle use human inedible feeds and by-products of human food production to produce nutrient-dense foods of great value to humans. Interventions to reduce GHG production: Reductions in land clearing and burning of grasslands and increased carbon sequestration in soils and trees have potential to substantially reduce GHG emissions. Increased efficiencies of production through intensified feeding and enteric modification have markedly reduced intensity of GHG emissions for cattle in Australia. Genetic selection for lower emissions has modest, but cumulative potential to reduce GHG (mostly CH4) emissions and intensity. Improved reproductive performance can reduce intensity of GHG emissions, especially in beef production. Feeds and technologies that reduce GHG production and intensity include improved pastures, grain feeding, dietary lipids, nitrates, ionophores, seaweed, 3-NOP, hormonal growth promotants in beef, and improved diets for peri-parturient dairy cattle. There is considerable potential to further reduce emissions from cattle using the technologies reviewed. Interventions to reduce heat stress: Cattle are susceptible to heat stress and ameliorating interventions include tree and shelter belts, shade, housing, cooling with fans and water and dietary manipulations. Conclusions: Numerous interventions can reduce GHG emissions and intensity from cattle. There are opportunities to increase carbon capture and maintain biodiversity in Australia's extensive rangelands, but these require quantification and application. We can reduce the intensity of CH4 emissions for cattle in Australia and simultaneously improve their well-being. Â© 2021 Australian Veterinary Association.

TI  - Mechanical Stimuli Enhance the Growth of Ulva fasciata (Chlorophyta) Spores
AB  - The macroalgal forest is being transformed to barren ground in coastal areas due to climate change. Current recovery technologies are ineffective, and an understanding of the fouling mechanism of macroalgae would assist restoration of macroalgal forests. Here, it is attempted to promote the growth of Ulva fasciata spores using an artificial biofilm composed of alginate and silica particles (the most abundant polymers and inorganics in marine biofilms) by mimicking marine environments. The presence of silica particles in the artificial biofilm increased the average germling length of Ulva spores, suggesting that mechanical stimuli generated by the silica particles enhanced growth of Ulva spores. As the stiffness of the model substrates (polystyrene, hydrophilic silica, hydrophobic silica, PDMS) increased, the germling length of the spores increased irrespective of surface chemistry and hydrophobicity. These results suggest that manipulation of the mechanical stimuli generated by the substrate could enable control of macroalgal fouling.

TI  - Enhanced autotrophic growth of Nannochloris sp. with trona buffer for sustainable carbon recycle
AB  - In this study, a potential applicability of a modified Shuisheng-4 culture medium with trona buffer for CO2(g) capture and the resultant CO2-rich solution was investigated for the autotrophic growth of Nannochloris sp. Trona is an inexpensive naturally-occurring mineral with high solubility in water. Trona solution after absorbing CO2(g) controlled at pH ~7 ~ 8 contains high dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration in water applicable to both open and closed systems and the pH is suitable for the growth. High DIC concentration was also found to enhance the autotrophic growth rate when the Na+ concentration is ~ &lt; 0.12 M. However, the tolerance of a marine green alga, Nannochloris sp., to Na+ ion was found to twice as much as that of a freshwater green alga, Chlorella vulgaris. Therefore, it is anticipated that trona buffer solution has potential for better CO2 utilization for the mutual benefit of microalgae-derived biofuels production and carbon recycle.

TI  - Negative emissions technologies: A complementary solution for climate change mitigation
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is the main greenhouse gas (GHG) and its atmospheric concentration is currently 50% higher than pre-industrial levels. The continuous GHGs emissions may lead to severe and irreversible consequences in the climate system. The reduction of GHG emissions may be not enough to mitigate climate change. Consequently, besides carbon capture from large emission sources, atmospheric CO 2 capture may be also required. To meet the target defined for climate change mitigation, the removal of 10 GtÂ·yr âˆ’1 of CO 2 globally by mid-century and 20 GtÂ·yr âˆ’1 of CO 2 globally by the end of century. The technologies applied with this aim are known as negative emission technologies (NETs), as they lead to achieve a negative balance of carbon in atmosphere. This paper aims to present the recent research works regarding NETs, focusing the research findings achieved by academic groups and projects. Besides several advantages, NETs present high operational cost and its scale-up should be tested to know the real effect on climate change mitigation. With current knowledge, no single process should be seen as a solution. Research efforts should be performed to evaluate and reduce NETs costs and environmental impact. Â© 2019

TI  - A study on bicarbonate production by boiler's flue gases CO2 condensation for algae culturing and biofuels production
AB  - Reduction of green house gases (GHGs) emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, petroleum products and natural gas is a big Challenge. Especially, CO2 due to its role in global climate change. Industrial boilers are considered to be one of the largest stationary sources of CO2 emissions in oil and gas (O&amp;G) industries(J.C.M. Pires.et al., 2012). These emissions from boiler's stack represent the highest ratio of the boiler losses because of the heat carried out by hot combustion products (nitrogen, carbon dioxide, sulfur oxide and excess oxygen). The high amount of energy wasted by dry flue gases depends on the amount of water vapor loss. The amount of wasted energy depends on final boiler exhaust temperature and mainly the hydrogen content of the fuel which ranges from 4 to 11%, depending on the type of fuel.One potential way to reduce this emission is to capture, transport and store CO2 either in geologic or oceanic formations. In addition, storage of CO2 in geologic formations could lead to new environmental issues such as threat of CO2 leakage, or potential contamination of ground water(Dennis Y.C.Leunga.et al., 2014). Biomitigation is an ideal and sustainable alternative solution for CO2 capture and recycle (CCR) by using microalgae. Using algae, as a source of biofuels offers many advantages over traditional biofuel crops including the potential to be grown on the marginal land, use of water sources which is not suitable for agriculture because algae can tolerate high salt content. Meanwhile, they sustain high growth rates, and relatively high lipid content. In fact, using captured CO2 to grow microalgae is limited by the high cost of CO2 capture technologies and utilization(Liam Brennan.et al.,2010). Moreover, algae grow poorly at night, as CO2 cannot be temporarily stored until sunrise. Therefore, the condensation of CO2 from flue gasses in the form of bicarbonate (HCO-3) solution would provide a superior alternative for CO2 delivery as feedstock for algae culture system (Van Den Hende et al., 2012.)Furthermore, it reduces CO2 emissions significantly up to 80%, and reduces the use of fossil fuels by improving the efficiency of boilers. In addition, transport and storage of the aqueous bicarbonate solution costs less than for that of compressed CO2. Â© Copyright 2015, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - Biological processes for CO2 capture
AB  - Rapid urbanization and advances in global civilization have resulted in a drastic increase in the global carbon dioxide (CO2) footprint in the past few decades. In addition, continuous consumption of unsustainable fossil fuels (e.g., coal, coke, and natural gas) and increased cement production for infrastructure development have certainly contributed to increased environmental pollution. While these emissions have been increasingly impacting our ecosystem, different approaches have been in use to capture CO2 from the industries as well as the atmosphere. Among various techniques, biological methods have found their importance with superior ecofriendly nature. In this chapter, different biological techniques, including microalgae, afforestation, and oceanic fertilization-based approaches, have been reviewed while highlighting their advantages along with limitations. Finally, toward the end of the chapter, challenges and future trends have been briefly discussed. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Biogenic acidification of Portuguese oyster Magallana angulata mariculture can be mediated through introducing brown seaweed Sargassum hemiphyllum
AB  - The physiological responses of aquaculture organisms (e.g., oyster and seaweed) have the potential to affect seawater carbon fluxes and subsequently are affected by these seawater changes. In this study, a laboratory experiment and a field mesocosm experiment were carried out in Daya Bay, southern China. In the laboratory experiment, Portuguese oyster Magallana angulata and the brown seaweed Sargassum hemiphyllum were mono cultured in 20-L transparent glass bottles for 24 h. Water sample were collected at four incubation time points (i.e. 0 h, 4 h, 12 h and 24 h) to examine their physiological responses across the incubation period. The results showed that the oyster calcification rate was not significantly changed among 4 h, 12 h and 24 h. On the other hand, during the 24 h incubation time, the oyster respiration rate, seawater pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and CO32- concentration were significantly declined, but the seawater CO2 concentration was increased. For the seaweed, from 0 h to 12 h, seawater CO2 and HCO3- concentrations were significantly declined. However, the seawater pH and DO concentration were increased. In the field experiment, oyster and seaweed were cultured in mesocosm bags. The effects of different culture models of M. angulata and S. hemiphyllum (i.e. oyster monoculture, seaweed monoculture and oyster-seaweed co-culture) on seawater CO2-carbonate system and air-sea CO2 flux (F-CO2) were investigated after 24 h incubation. The results showed that DIC, HCO3- and CO2 concentrations and the partial pressure of CO2 in co-culture bags were significantly lower than the control bags (without any culture organisms) and oyster bags, indicated that S. hemiphyllum can effectively absorb the CO2 released by the oysters. The negative values of air-sea F-CO2 in the co-culture bags represent a CO2 sink from the atmosphere to the sea. These results demonstrated that aquaculture organism monoculture could result in a stress for itself, and there could be an interspecies mutual benefit for both M. angulata and S. hemiphyllum in the co-culture system. The negative environmental impacts of mono-trophic oyster aquaculture in this view could be mediated with the multi-trophic inclusion of seaweed.

TI  - Conversion of carbon dioxide to oxaloacetate using integrated carbonic anhydrase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase
AB  - The development and implementation of strategies for CO 2mitigation are necessary to counteract the greenhouse gas effect of carbon dioxide emissions. To demonstrate the possibility of simultaneously capturing CO2 and utilizing four-carbon compounds, an integrated system using CA and PEPCase was developed, which mimics an in vivo carbon dioxide concentration mechanism. We first cloned the PEPCase 1 gene of the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and produced a recombinant PtPEPCase 1. The affinity column purified PtPEPCase 1 exhibited specific enzymatic activity (5.89 U/mg). When the simultaneous and coordinated reactions of CA from Dunaliella sp. and the PtPEPCase 1 occurred, more OAA was produced than when only PEPCase was present. Therefore, this integrated CA-PEPCase system can be used not only to capture CO2 but also for a new technology to produce value-added four-carbon platform chemicals.Â©Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

TI  - Removal of an established invader can change gross primary production of native macroalgae and alter carbon flow in intertidal rock pools
AB  - The impact of invasive species on recipient communities can vary with environmental context and across levels of biological complexity. We investigated how an established invasive seaweed species affected the biomass, eco-physiology, carbon and nitrogen storage capacity of native seaweeds at sites with a different environmental setting due to a persistent upwelling in northern Spain. We removed the invasive Japanese wireweed Sargassum muticum from intertidal rock pools once every month during a one-year period and used an in-situ stable isotope pulse-chase labeling to estimate gross primary production (GPP), nitrogen uptake rate, 13C-carbon and 15N-nitrogen storage capacities. Following the addition of 13C-enriched bicarbonate and 15N-enriched nitrate to the seawater in the rock pools during the period of the low tide, we sampled macroalgal thalli at incoming tide to determine label uptake rate. After four days, we sampled macroalgal assemblages to determine both label storage capacity and biomass. After one year of removal there was no change in the macroalgal assemblage. However, both the GPP and 13C-carbon storage capacity were higher in the turf-forming Corallina spp. and, sometimes, in the canopy-forming Bifurcaria bifurcata. Nitrogen uptake rate followed similar, but more variable results. Although S. muticum inhibited carbon storage capacity of native species, the assemblage-level 13C-carbon storage was similar in the S. muticumâ€”removed and control rock pools because the presence of the invasive species compensated for the functional loss of native species, particularly at sites where it was most abundant. No obvious effects were observed in relation to the environmental setting. Overall, the effect of the invasive S. muticum on carbon flow appeared to be mediated both by the effects on resource-use efficiency of native species and by its own biomass. Integrating physiological and assemblage-level responses can provide a broad understanding of how invasive species affect recipient communities and ecosystem functioning. Â© 2019 Rossi et al.

TI  - Sources of sediment carbon sequestered in restored seagrass meadows
AB  - Seagrass meadows accumulate carbon in sediments as a result of in situ production and sedimentation of particulate organic matter (OM). We quantified the contribution of OM sources to the sediment carbon pool in restored seagrass meadows of different ages (unvegetated and 4 and 10 yr since restoration) in the Virginia coastal bays. Using carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stable isotopes, we estimated the contribution of seagrass (Zostera marina), benthic diatoms and sestonic particles (BD/S), and macroalgae (MA) to the sediment OM pool influenced by restoration (top 10 cm) with a Bayesian mixing model. Marsh grass was not a likely source based on C: N ratios of the sediment OM. The 4 and 10 yr seagrass meadows had similar OM source contributions to the top 10 cm of sediment, which were distinct from those of unvegetated sites. Seagrass, BD/S, and MA contributed 41, 56, and 3\%, respectively, in the 10 yr age treatments and 50, 46, and 4\%, respectively, in the 4 yr age treatments. Diagenesis of OM sources had little impact on the source contribution estimates. In combination with carbon accumulation rates at these sites (37 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), these results indicate that 10 yr after seeding, restored seagrass meadows accumulated seagrass carbon at a rate of 14.3 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and non-seagrass carbon (BD/S and MA) at a rate of 22.4 g C m(-2) yr(-1). This study demonstrates how seagrass restoration contributes to the sequestration of `blue carbon' and quantifies the impact restored seagrass meadow age has on stored sediment carbon.

TI  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE AND pH TOLERANCE OF INDUCED CO2 IN ULVA RIGIDA C.AGARDH, 1823(CHLOROPHYTA) UNDER CONTROLLED CONDITIONS
AB  - The increase in integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA), where seaweed (particularly Ulva rigidaC.Agardh, 1823) is used as a feedstock and a wastewater scrubber in South African IMTA systems, has necessitated research into seaweed growth rates, which hassubsequently increased production technologies.Seaweed growth can be increased by controlling the culture media.One of the means to control growth rate is through CO2 gas addition to culture media via aeration.This has the potential added benefit of usingwaste CO2 production from an alternative source to decrease overall carbon dioxide emissions. The consequence of elevated CO2 concentration on the pH of culture medium and the equivalent functional reactions in the seaweed were examined using U. rigida in flow-through systems.Toxicity investigation of Hydrogen ion concentrations werecarried out on U. rigida to examine their anatomy cum functional differences arising due to CO2 exerted stress. Elevated CO2 levels and the accompanying decrease in culture media pH (4.71 - 6.67) leadto a significant decrease in biomass with varied sporulation activities. In addition, U. rigida in flow-through systems showed a gradual degeneration in specific growth rate, from day 7, atvarying rates until the end of the experiment in the following sequence pH 7.20 > 8.20 > 7.50 > 7.80.The treatment set at pH 7.20 yielded the greatest specific biomassandthe greatest produce.The cultured input stocking rate of 5 g.l-1 of seawater proved to be suitable for cultivation. ThepH toxicity reaction was significant in predicting the suitability of seaweed cultured under CO2 induced concentrations.

TI  - Carbon dioxide mitigation and biodiesel production by a marine microalga under mixotrophic mode by using transesterification by-product crude glycerol: A synergy of biofuels and waste valorization
AB  - The present work integrates carbon sequestration and waste reclamation with biofuel production into a single dynamic for encouraging eco-friendlier approaches ensuring environmental sustainability. To achieve improved carbon capturing and lipid production, a marine microalga Picochlorum soloecismus was selected. The maximum productivities of biomass and lipid were asserted to be 0.24 Â± 0.02 gLâˆ’1dâˆ’1 and 58.2 Â± 0.2 mgLâˆ’1dâˆ’1 under a CO2 supply of 17.0% at 0.7 vvm aeration in a 5 L photobioreactor under photoautotrophic condition. A low-priced mixotrophic medium was designed using CO2 with the transesterification by-product, i.e., crude glycerol. This produced maximum biomass and lipid productivities of 0.67 Â± 0.04 and 0.13 Â± 0.01 gLâˆ’1dâˆ’1 at a carbon fixation rate of 0.77 Â± 0.06 gLâˆ’1dâˆ’1. The effect of mixotrophy was also investigated on a modified culture medium, i.e. Optimized ASN (Artificial Seawater Nutrient) prepared in our recent study generating a maximum lipid productivity of 0.31 Â± 0.02 gLâˆ’1dâˆ’1at a carbon fixation rate of 0.80 Â± 0.07 gLâˆ’1dâˆ’1. The use of crude glycerol in place of commercial glycerol for mixotrophy can reduce the medium cost by 22-fold. The methyl ester profile of biodiesel obtained under mixotrophy exhibited higher proportion of saturated fats and lower fraction of unsaturated fats. The fuel parameters lied within the established biodiesel standards. Â© 2022 The Authors

TI  - The importance of coastal gorgonians in the blue carbon budget
AB  - Terrestrial (trees, shrubs) and marine (seaweeds and seagrasses) organisms act as carbon (C) sinks, but the role of benthic suspension feeders in this regard has been largely neglected so far. Gorgonians are one of the most conspicuous inhabitants of marine animal forests (mainly composed of sessile filter feeders); their seston capture rates influence benthic-pelagic coupling processes and they act as C sinks immobilizing carbon in their long-living structures. Three gorgonian species (Paramuricea clavata, Eunicella singularis and Leptogorgia sarmentosa) were studied coupling data of population size structure, biomass and spatial distribution in a NW Mediterranean area (Cap de Creus, Spain) with feeding, respiration and growth rates. In the study area, we calculated that P. clavata sequestered 0.73 +/- 0.71 g C m(-2) year(-1) E. singularis 0.73 +/- 0.89g C m(-2) year(-1) and L. sarmentosa 0.03 +/- 0.02g C m(-2) year(-1) To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to calculate the importance as C sinks of gorgonian species that we consider as a starting point to estimate the importance of marine animal forests in C sequestration, and to ensure appropriate management and protection especially in areas and at depths where they are concentrated.

TI  - Reuse of shrimp farm wastewater as growth medium for marine microalgae isolated from Red Sea - Jeddah
AB  - Microalgae can grow effectively on various wastewaters, including those generated in aquaculture as a result of operation of hatcheries and farming systems. These organisms are able to remove pollutants from their growth environment, while the biomass produced can be further exploited. Such biomass contains lipids rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and other substantial nutrients and can be used as a live feed in shrimp farming or in fisheries, i.e. as live feed for zooplankton or as fish feed supplement after enzymatic and/or chemical treatment. In the current work, a shrimp farm wastewater (SFW) with high nutrient (P, N) concentrations was used as growth medium for six newly isolated marine microalgae strains from Saudi Arabian coastal waters, including Chlorella sp., Dunaliella sp., Nannochloropsis sp., Navicula sp. (two strains) and Tetraselmis sp.. The growth yields and kinetics parameters were compared to those obtained in synthetic f/2 medium. Among these strains, Navicula sp. (both strains) and Tetraselmis sp. were able to grow well on SFW, producing high lipid quantities (especially Navicula sp. 1) containing polyunsaturated fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid. However, microalgae lipids produced in SFW medium were in general more saturated than those produced in f/2 medium. It seems that several desaturases, of both the C16 and C18 group, and probably the C16:0 elongase, were inhibited in SFW medium modifying accordingly the fatty acid profile. Considering the overall physiological behavior of the strains, including biomass yields and fatty acid composition, we conclude that SFW can be valorized in a sustainable way for microalgae production in fisheries.

TI  - Microalgal biotechnology: Biofuels and bioproducts
AB  - In the twenty-first century, energy is considered as the most important issue for human sustainability. The worldâ€™s dependence on unsustainable fossil fuels (almost 90%), and the increasing population demand new sources of energy for sustainable human activities. Algae, and particularly microalgae have nowadays become of enormous importance as a new potential source of feedstock for renewable bioenergy production. As photosynthetic microorganisms, microalgae may potentially be produced as carbon neutral and can be produced on non-arable land and cultured in marine and wastewater e?uents. Furthermore, microalgae can be used to produce a range of products such as protein-rich animal feed in aquaculture, high-value products, viz, polyunsaturated fatty acids, bioactive and functional pigments and natural dyes, health foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. In this chapter, an update of the advances in microalgal biotechnology is presented as a new biomass for the potential development of biofuels, and as a realistic source of highly valuable molecules of industrial interest. The potential to harness endogenous carbon storage compounds, triacylglyceride (TAGs) and starch, as products of photosynthesis, including the photoproduction of hydrogen, can contribute to diversify the sources and yields of feedstocks for biofuel production. Even if the production of microalgae for biofuels is highly promissory and clearly has potential for contributing to environmental, social, and economic sustainability, presently this alternative is unsustainable. Definitely, the combination of bio-fuel production by microalgal biotechnology with co-products may contribute to the sustainability of biofuels, a condition with null or less impact on natural resources and biodiversity. The integration of all the components of the uses of microalgae, i. e, high-value compounds, aquaculture, and bioremediation coupled to the production of bio-fuels will play an important role in the near future to make the production of biofuels from microalgae sustainable.

TI  - The potential fertilizer value of Namibian beach-cast seaweed (Laminaria pallida and Gracilariopsis funicularis) biochar as a nutrient source in organic agriculture
AB  - Biochar has been reported as an efficient tool for carbon sequestration and soil quality improvement, though most research has evaluated the quality of biochar from terrestrial based materials. The study evaluated the macro; micro nutrients and heavy metal concentrations of biochar from seaweeds from Namibian coast. Seaweed species Laminaria pallida and Gracilariopsis funicularis were pyrolysed at different temperatures i.e. control (uncharred); 200; 400; 600 and 800 Â°C in order to determine the chemical and physical properties of the biochar produced. There were significant interactions (P < 0.05) between temperature and seaweed species on most parameters measured. A pyrolysis temperature of 400 Â°C resulted in an almost 50% reduction in biochar yield, with higher temperatures resulting in even more yield loss whilst producing biochar with higher alkaline pH above 7 and high EC above 20 mS/cm. G. funicularis biochar resulted in the highest macro element content with total C 38.3%; N 4.3% and P 6.3 g/kg, whilst L. pallida biochar had the highest contents of cations of 16.2 g/kg Ca; 6.4 g/kg Mg; 151 g/kg K and 45 g/kg Na. Higher pyrolysis temperatures did not result in consistent changes in total heavy metal content, with only Cd content being above the maximum permissible limits for biochar of 3.9 mg/kg. Generally, a pyrolysis temperature of 400Â°C was observed to give biochar with the best quality in terms of macro elements, pH and total C. G. funicularis biochar showed significantly higher nutrient concentrations, therefore has great potential in soil quality improvement. Â© 2020 The Author(s)

TI  - Quantification of blue carbon stocks associated with Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadows in Corsica (NW Mediterranean)
AB  - In the last decades, the increasing necessity to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations has intensified interest in quantifying the capacity of coastal ecosystems to sequester carbon, referred to commonly as `Blue Carbon' (BC). Among coastal habitats, seagrass meadows are considered as natural carbon sinks due to their capacity to store large amounts of carbon in their sediments over long periods of time. However, the spatial heterogeneity of carbon stocks in seagrass sediments needs to be better understood to improve the accuracy of BC assessments, particularly where there is high environmental variability. In the Mediterranean, Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile constitutes extensive meadows considered as long-term carbon sinks due to the development of an exceptional structure known as `matte', reaching several meters in height, which can be preserved over millennia. In order to specify the role of P. oceanica meadows in climate change mitigation, an estimate of carbon stocks has been conducted along the eastern coast of Corsica (NW Mediterranean). The approach is mainly based on the biogeochemical analysis of 39 sediment cores. Organic carbon (C-org; 327 +/- 150 t ha(-1), mean +/- SE) and inorganic carbon stocks (C-inorg; 245 +/- 45 t ha-1) show a high variability related to water depth, matrix (sandy vs rocky substrate) or the depositional environment (coastal vs estuary). The isotopic signature (delta C-13) revealed a substantial contribution of allochthonous inputs of organic matter (macroalgae and sestonic sources) mainly in estuarine environment and shallow areas. The carbon stocks in the first 250 cm of matte (average thickness) were estimated at 5.6-14.0 million t C-org (study site) and 14.6-36.9 million t C-org (Corsica), corresponding to 11.6-29.2 and 30.4-76.8 years of CO2 emissions from the population of Corsica.

TI  - WASTE HEAT UTILIZATION IN AQUACULTURE: SOME FUTURISTIC AND PLAUSIBLE SCHEMES.
AB  - Futuristic and plausible aquaculture schemes for utilization of waste heat from steam generating facilities are discussed. Multiple use of land and water owned or used by a utility is the underlying theme in any of these programs. Animals or plants that could be cultured include marine and freshwater species, such as fish, eels, shrimp, prawns, clams, seaweeds, and algae. Integration of secondarily-treated sewage effluent into these schemes for nutrient removal is also feasible. Each species envisioned for culture has commercial value such as food for humans or livestock, bait for recreational fishing, emulsifiers for industrial proccesses, an energy source for direct combustion, or as an energy sparing commodity. Other schemes, such as culture of marine sea turtles and manatees in thermal effluents, have benefits in conservation, weed control, and public relations programs.

TI  - Potential of the Micro and Macro Algae for Biofuel Production: A Brief Review
AB  - The world seems to be raising its energy needs owing to an expanding population and people's desire for higher living standards. Diversification biofuel sources have become an important energy issue in recent times. Among the various resources, algal biomass has received much attention in the recent years due to its relatively high growth rate, its vast potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change, and their ability to store high amounts of lipids and carbohydrates. These versatile organisms can also be used for the production of biofuel. In this review, sustainability and the viability of algae as an up-coming biofuel feedstock have been discussed. Additionally, this review offers an overview of the status of biofuel production through algal biomass and progress made so far in this area.

TI  - The effects of feedstock pre-treatment and pyrolysis temperature on the production of biochar from the green seaweed Ulva
AB  - Green seaweeds from the genus Ulva are a promising feedstock for the production of biochar for carbon (C) sequestration and soil amelioration. Ulva can be cultivated in waste water from land-based aqua culture and Ulva blooms ({''}green tides{''}) strand millions of tons of biomass on coastal areas of Europe and China each year. The conversion of Ulva into biochar could recycle C and nutrients from eutrophic water into agricultural production. We produce biochar from Ulva ohnoi, cultivated in waste water from an aquaculture facility, and characterize its suitability for C sequestration and soil amelioration through biochemical analyses and plant growth experiments. Two biomass pre-treatments (fresh water rinsing to reduce salt, and pelletisation to increase density) were crossed with four pyrolysis temperatures (300 750 C). Biomass rinsing decreased the ash and increased the C content of the resulting biochar. However, biochar produced from un-rinsed biomass had a higher proportion of fixed C and a higher yield. C sequestration decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperatures due to the combination of lower yield and lower total C content of biochar produced at high temperatures. Biochar produced from un-rinsed biomass at 300 degrees C had the greatest gravimetric C sequestration (110-120 g stable C kg(-1) seaweed). Biochar produced from un-pelletised Ulva enhanced plant growth three-fold in low fertility soils when the temperature of pyrolysis was less than 450 degrees C. The reduced effectiveness of the high temperature biochars (>450 degrees C) was due to a lower N and higher salt content. Soil ameliorated with biochar produced from pelletised biomass had suppressed plant germination and growth. The most effective biochar for C sequestration and soil amelioration was produced from un-rinsed and un-pelletised Ulva at 300 degrees C. The green tide that occurs annually along the Shandong coastline in China generates sufficient biomass (200,000 tons dry weight) to ameliorate 12,500 ha of soil, sequester 15,000 t C and recycle 5500 t N into agriculture. We provide clear parameters for biochar production to enable the beneficial use of this biomass. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Salt marsh plants carbon storage in a temperate Atlantic estuary illustrated by a stable isotopic analysis based approach
AB  - The biomasses, carbon standing stocks, and exportations of three saltmarsh species - Scirpus maritimus, Spartina maritima and Zostera noltii - were determined and their isotopic composition analyzed to illustrate their role in carbon storage in a temperate Atlantic estuary (Mondego, Portugal). Biomass values were higher in the warmer seasons than in the cold seasons, with carbon contents following the same trend. Carbon content ranged from 27-39% in S. maritimus and S. maritima to 30-39% for Z. noltii. S. maritimus had the highest carbon production in the aboveground organs and had similar results with S. maritima in the belowground carbon production. These three species together occupied about 50% of the salt marsh area and they stored in 21 months of study 24,000 kg of carbon in their aboveground and belowground organs. Z. noltii presented highest carbon concentration in the sediment and S. maritimus the lowest. Stable carbon isotopic analysis showed that apparently, the sedimentary organic matter is composed by a mix of terrestrial sources, macro and microalgae. Regard the high carbon exportation, S. maritima and Z. noltii are constantly accumulating carbon. The studied species have both a sink and source behaviour simultaneously.

TI  - Toward Sustainable Hydroxymethylfurfural Production Using Seaweeds
AB  - Chemical manufacturing involves carbon sources releasing CO2 into the atmosphere. By contrast, seaweeds are carbon sinks that can absorb released CO2 and therefore have great potential for use as feedstocks in sustainable chemical manufacturing. In particular, seaweeds could contribute to mitigating vast amounts of global CO2 emissions. Accordingly, seaweeds could be an excellent candidate biomaterial for sustainable production of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), called a â€˜sleeping giantâ€™ platform chemical due to its wide versatility in chemical manufacturing. HMF is produced through sugar dehydration mechanisms, and seaweed storage glucans comprised of glucose can be appropriate feeding substrates for its production. This opinion article introduces a new opportunity for sustainable production of HMF using storage glucan-rich seaweeds. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Symposium review: Effective nutritional strategies to mitigate enteric methane in dairy cattle
AB  - Intensive research in the past decade has resulted in a better understanding of factors driving enteric methane (CH4) emissions in ruminants. Meta-analyses of large databases, developed through the GLOBAL NETWORK project, have identified successful strategies for mitigation of CH4 emissions. Methane inhibitors, alternative electron sinks, vegetable oils and oilseeds, and tanniferous forages are among the recommended strategies for mitigating CH4 emissions from dairy and beef cattle and small ruminants. These strategies were also effective in decreasing CH4 emissions yield and intensity. However, a higher inclusion rate of oils may negatively affect feed intake, rumen function, and animal performance, specifically milk components in dairy cows. In the case of nitrates (electron sinks), concerns with animal health may be impeding their adoption in practice, and potential emission trade-offs have to be considered. Tannins and tanniferous forages may have a negative effect on nutrient digestibility, and more research is needed to confirm their effects on overall animal performance in long-term experiments with high-producing animals. A meta-analysis of studies with dairy cows fed the CH4 inhibitor 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) at the Pennsylvania State University showed (1) a consistent 28 to 32\% decrease in daily CH4 emissions or emissions yield and intensity; (2) no effect on dry matter intake, milk production, body weight, or body weight change, and a slight increase in milk fat concentration and yield (0.19 percentage units and 90 g/d, respectively); 3-NOP also appears to increase milk urea nitrogen concentration; (3) an exponential decrease in the mitigation effect of the inhibitor with increasing its dose (from 40 to 200 mg/kg of feed dry matter, corresponding to 3-NOP intake of 1 to 4.8 g/ cow per day); and (4) a potential decrease in the efficacy of 3-NOP over time, which needs to be further investigated in long-term, full-lactation or multiple-lactation studies. The red macroalga Asparagopsis taxiformis has a strong CH4 mitigation effect, but studies are needed to determine its feasibility, long-term efficacy, and effects on animal production and health. We concluded that widespread adoption of mitigation strategies with proven effectiveness by the livestock industries will depend on cost, government policies and incentives, and willingness of consumers to pay a higher price for animal products with decreased carbon footprint.

TI  - Switchable green solvents for lipids extraction from microalgae
AB  - Algae, with its high ability to grow in seawater by carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration, can provide sustainable solutions for energy, water, food security, and sustainable land use. They can be considered as a potentially transformative feedstock and provide solutions to many pressing technoeconomic and environmental challenges the globe is facing today. Algae-based biofuels reduce consumption of fossil fuels. Most of the algal species are oil producers and are significantly higher than other crops like soybean, sunflower, canola, jatropha, and palm. Hence, it is a critical requirement to quantify the lipid content. There needs to be robust analytical procedures and facilities that can cater and support the technological needs of lipid extraction and estimation, as well as to provide quick, accurate, and reproducible results. Cost and the lipid production and extraction processes are the main influencing parameters for algal biodiesel production. Lipid extraction in microalgae is mainly performed by using conventional solvents or hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Usage of conventional solvents in lipid extraction influences the quality of the product (chlorophyll contamination) leading to poor quality product. To circumvent the problem, usage of green solvents (green extraction technologies) is more attractive in lipid extraction. The present chapter describes the types of solvent systems preferred in microalgal lipid extraction and methods of lipid extraction and estimation. It summarizes the challenges in this area of work and describes the status of analytical techniques. This provides a balanced perspective on the potential path in establishing holistic and integrated lipid extraction, solvents usage, and estimation facility. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Carbon subsidies shift a northern peatland biofilm community towards heterotrophy in low but not high nutrient conditions
AB  - Producer-decomposer interactions within aquatic biofilms can range from mutualistic associations to competition depending on available resources. The outcomes of such interactions have implications for biogeochemical cycling and, as such, may be especially important in northern peatlands, which are a global carbon sink and are expected to experience changes in resource availability with climate change. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of nutrients and organic carbon on the relative proportion of primary producers (microalgae) and heterotrophic decomposers (bacteria and fungi) during aquatic biofilm development in a boreal peatland. Given that decomposers are often better competitors for nutrients than primary producers in aquatic ecosystems, we predicted that labile carbon subsidies would shift the biofilm composition towards heterotrophy owing to the ability of decomposers to outcompete primary producers for available nutrients in the absence of carbon limitation. We manipulated nutrients (nitrate and phosphate) and organic carbon (glucose) in a full factorial design using nutrient-diffusing substrates in an Alaskan fen. Heterotrophic bacteria were limited by organic carbon and algae were limited by inorganic nutrients. However, the outcomes of competitive interactions depended on background nutrient levels. Heterotrophic bacteria were able to outcompete algae for available nutrients when organic carbon was elevated and nutrient levels remained low, but not when organic carbon and nutrients were both elevated through enrichment. Fungal biomass was significantly lower in the presence of glucose alone, possibly owing to antagonistic interactions with heterotrophic bacteria. In contrast to bacteria, fungi were stimulated along with algae following nutrient enrichment. The decoupling of algae and heterotrophic bacteria in the presence of glucose alone shifted the biofilm trophic status towards heterotrophy. This effect was overturned when nutrients were enriched along with glucose, owing to a subsequent increase in algal biomass in the absence of nutrient limitation. By measuring individual components of the biofilm and obtaining data on the trophic status, we have begun to establish a link between resource availability and biofilm formation in northern peatlands. Our results show that labile carbon subsidies from outside sources have the potential to disrupt microbial coupling and shift the metabolic balance in favour of heterotrophy. The extent to which this occurs in the future will probably depend on the timing and composition of bioavailable nutrients delivered to surface waters with environmental change (e.g. permafrost thaw).

TI  - Impacts of large-scale aquaculture activities on the seawater carbonate system and air-sea CO2 flux in a subtropical mariculture bay, southern China
AB  - In this study, the variations of the seawater carbonate system parameters and air-sea CO2 flux (F-CO2) of Shen'ao Bay, a typical subtropical aquaculture bay located in China, were investigated in spring 2016 (March to May). Parameters related to the seawater carbonate system and F-CO2 were measured monthly in 3 different aquaculture areas (fish, oyster and seaweed) and in a non-culture area near the bay mouth. The results showed that the seawater carbonate system was markedly influenced by the biological processes of the culture species. Total alkalinity was significantly lower in the oyster area compared with the fish and seaweed areas, mainly because of the calcification process of oysters. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) were highest in the fish area, followed by the oyster and non-culture areas, and lowest in the seaweed area. Oysters and fish can have indirect influences on DIC and pCO(2) by releasing nutrients, which facilitate the growth of seaweed and phytoplankton and therefore promote photosynthetic CO2 fixation. For these reasons, Shen'ao Bay acts as a potential CO2 sink in spring, with an average F-CO2 ranging from -1.2 to -4.8 mmol m(-2) d(-1). CO2 fixation in the seaweed area was the largest contributor to CO2 flux, accounting for ca. 58\% of the total CO2 sink capacity of the entire bay. These results suggest that the carbonate system and F-CO2 of Shen'ao Bay were significantly affected by large-scale mariculture activities. A higher CO2 sink capacity could be acquired by extending the culture area of seaweed.

TI  - Biomass production of marine microalga Tetraselmis suecica using biogas and wastewater as nutrients
AB  - Anaerobic digestion is a suitable method for treating organic wastes and generating biogas. This biogas contains significant amount of CO2 and some other contaminants. The coupling of wastewater treatment with biogas purification using saline microalgae could effectively upgrade biogas (through photosynthetic CO2 fixation) and concurrently remove nutrients from the effluent, while producing valuable algal biomass. In this context, Tetraselmis suecica biomass production with the use of an impurity (CO2) in biogas to supply carbon, and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) from anaerobically-digested piggery effluent (ADPE) was investigated at four operating pH set points (6.5, 7.5, 8.5 and 9.5). Results showed that pH 7.5 produced the optimum conditions for T. suecica growth and biogas-based CO2 removal, with the maximum biomass (59.8 mg L-1 d(-1)), lipid (25 mg L-1 d(-1)) and carbohydrate (6.5 mg L-1 d(-1)) productivities. Under this condition, CO2, total nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies were 94.7\%, 96\% and 72\%, respectively. Furthermore, the results showed no inhibitory effect of dissolved CH4 on the growth of T. suecica at pH 7.5, suggesting the technical feasibility of harnessing marine T. suecica for simultaneous nutrients removal from wastewaters, biogas upgrading, and production of energy-rich algal biomass. This process clearly harnesses anaerobically-digested piggery effluent not only as an asset but also uses an impurity (CO2) in biogas to produce valuable algal biomass.

TI  - Microalgae starch: A promising raw material for the bioethanol production
AB  - Ethanol is currently the most successful biofuel and can be produced from microalgal biomass (third-generation). Ethanol from microalgal biomass has advantages because it does not use arable land and reduces environmental impacts through the sequestration of CO2 from the atmosphere. In this way, micro and macroalgal starch, which is structurally similar to that from higher plants can be considered a promise raw material for the production of bioethanol. Thus, strategies can be used to intensify the carbohydrate concentration in the microalgal biomass enabling the production of third-generation bioethanol. The microalgae biomass can be destined to biorefineries so that the residual biomass generated from the extraction processes is used for the production of high value-added products. Therefore, the process will have an impact on reducing the production costs and the generation of waste. In this context, this review aims to bring concepts and perspectives on the production of third-generation bioethanol, demonstrating the microalgal biomass potential as a carbon source to produce bioethanol and supply part of the world energy demand. The main factors that influence the microalgal cultivation and fermentation process, aswell as the processes of transformation of biomass into the easily fermentable substrate are also discussed.

TI  - The Use of Microalgae for Coupling Wastewater Treatment With CO2 Biofixation
AB  - Production and emission of CO2 from different sources have caused significant changes in the climate, which is the major concern related to global warming. Among other CO2 removal approaches, microalgae can efficiently remove CO2 through the rapid production of algal biomass. In addition, microalgae have the potential to be used in wastewater treatment. Although, wastewater treatment and CO2 removal by microalgae have been studied separately for a long time, there is no detailed information available on combining both processes. In this review article, microalgae-based CO2 biofixation, various microalgae cultivation systems; and microalgae-derived wastewater treatment are separately discussed, followed by the concept of integration of CO2 biofixation process and wastewater treatment. In each section, details of energy efficiency and differences across microalgae species are also given.

TI  - Microalgae, macroalgae, and bivalves as biofilters in land-based mariculture in Israel
AB  - Protein is the most expensive component in fish feed and the main source of nitrogenous pollution in fish culture. It is therefore economically desirable to maximize the conversion of feed protein into a valuable biomass, and environmentally desirable to minimize nitrogenous waste. Both ends can be achieved in algal-dependent integrated mariculture. Unlike fish-cage effluents, fishpond effluents can be treated. Use of marketable organisms as biofilters increases both diversification and income of the mariculture operation. Algal biofiltration has a stabilizing influence on water quality since, unlike bacteria, algae counteract the consumption of oxygen and the production Of CO2 by the fish. However, algal biofilters probably cost more to build and use a larger land area when compared with the alternative bacterial nitrification-denitrification aquaculture biofilter systems. Biofiltration by algae and shellfish, as has been developed as a part of integrated mariculture at the Israeli National Center for Mariculture, offsets the added cost by added sales of the biofilter organisms. This approach is based on algal sunlight-dependent assimilation of nutrients and their conversion into microalgal or macroalgal biomass. The algae are then consumed by algivore invertebrates such as bivalves, gastropods, and sea urchins. Sea urchins in particular can also be used to remove organic detritus. In the fish-phytoplankton-bivalve integrated culture system, bivalves filter microalgae that develop in fishponds and sedimentation ponds in which fishpond effluents collect. Such systems require large treatment areas relative to fish production, and are therefore suitable for extensive or semi-intensive fish culture with relatively low land costs. In fish-seaweed integrated culture, nutrients are removed from the fishpond effluents by green macroalgae such as Ulva lactuca. The macroalgae (seaweeds) can subsequently be fed to macroalgivores or processed for human consumption. While water from the fishponds passes through the macroalgae ponds, most of the ammonia (up to 90\%,,) and significant fractions of other dissolved nutrients are removed from the water. The macroalgae improve the quality of the water by adding O-2 and removing excess CO2, thus making the water suitable for recirculation into the fishponds. The seaweed produced is excellent for feeding high-value macroalgivores such as abalone and sea urchins. Fish-seaweed integrated systems require less extensive land area than fish-phytoplankton-bivalve integrated systems and produce cleaner effluents. However, they may require larger inputs of capital and energy. Fish culture integrated with algal and shellfish biofilters has the potential to expand sustainably, meeting economic, environmental, and social concerns.

TI  - Plant based phosphorus recovery from wastewater via algae and macrophytes
AB  - At present, resource recovery by irrigation of wastewater to plants is usually driven by the value of the water resource rather than phosphorus recovery. Expanded irrigation for increased phosphorus recovery may be expected as the scarcity and price of phosphorus increases, but providing the necessary treatment, storage and conveyance comes at significant expense. An alternative to taking the wastewater to the plants is instead to take the plants to the wastewater. Algal ponds and macrophyte wetlands are already in widespread use for wastewater treatment and if harvested, would require less than one-tenth of the area to recover phosphorus compared to terrestrial crops/pastures. This area could be further decreased if the phosphorus content of the macrophytes and algae biomass was tripled from 1% to 3% via luxury uptake. While this and many other opportunities for plant based recovery of phosphorus exist, e.g. offshore cultivation, much of this technology development is still in its infancy. Research that enhances our understanding of how to maximise phosphorus uptake and harvest yields; and further add value to the biomass for reuse would see the recovery of phosphorus via plants become an important solution in the future.

TI  - Environmental impacts of seaweed co-culture on coastal fisheries
AB  - This chapter provides a brief review of seaweed co-culture and its environmental impact on coastal fisheries. First, the current situation and problems facing the coastal fisheries, and the plans to overcome these issues, are discussed. Finally, the positive and negative effects of seaweed culture, role of seaweed co-culture, and the overall environmental impact are addressed. Although worldwide mariculture production has increased steadily, productivity has tended to decline due to continued aquaculture activity in confined areas and natural disasters, such as, typhoons and outbreaks of red tide. In particular, the nutrient loading from unconsumed feed waste results in the deterioration of the water quality and outbreaks of diseases. To overcome these problems, integrated multi-trophic aquaculture has been suggested. In the integrated culture of seaweed and fish, seaweed plays an important role as both a CO2 sink and biofilter, greatly reducing the environmental impacts on coastal fisheries. The addition of the integrated culture of lugworms to this system could also have further benefits because of its potential for waste recycling and value as bait, which is expected to contribute towards a more sustainable and productive form of aquaculture. Furthermore, the use of cultured seaweed and their waste has been expanded based on the development of useful microbes, reducing their environmental impact. Â© 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

TI  - BIOSPHERIC OPTIONS FOR MITIGATING ATMOSPHERIC CARBON-DIOXIDE LEVELS
AB  - It will be extremely difficult to control worldwide sources of carbon over the next century in order to limit atmospheric carbon dioxide to twice pre-anthropogenic levels. This paper first discusses the options for CO2 mitigation, estimates their respective carbon reduction potentials, and then focuses on the research agenda to evaluate alternative terrestrial and marine systems for CO2 mitigation. The options being evaluated include: a) terrestrial reforestation strategies and halophyte production in semi-arid regions, b) algal refossilization of carbon dioxide and algal-induced carbon dioxide fixation, c) structured marine farms for energy and food production, and d) carbon dioxide clathrate formation and sequestration. EPRI is currently conducting fundamental research in each of these areas.  Many of these technological approaches will require intemational cooperation and acceptance, if they are to be deployed over the large areas necessary to fix and sequester CO2. Although the program is in its infancy, there are significant potentials for modulating terrestrial and marine systems to stimulate carbon removal from the atmosphere.

TI  - A novel strategy for sequestering atmospheric CO2: The use of sealed microalgal cultures located in the open-oceans
AB  - Here we introduce the concept of utilizing microalgal cultures grown in sealed enclosures located in open-oceans to sequester CO2 from both the atmosphere and flue gases. This method of sequestering CO2 overcomes the major limitations of sequestering appreciable CO2 using existing technologies, such as microalgae cultured in open ponds, photobioreactors, or continuous bioreactors on land or near shore. Open ponds require vast surface areas and generally have low net productivity due to light and temperature limitations during the night and winter periods. Continuous algal bioreactors are much more productive, but this comes at the expense of controlling the parameters of the bioreactors, such as light regimes and temperature. The additional energy inputs used to control the parameters of the bioreactors negate their effectiveness of sequestering CO2 on a global scale. Near shore photobioreactors lack the capacity to be scaled up to sequester appreciable CO2. Alternatively, we propose that atmospheric CO2 and/or the flue gases (containing CO2, NOx and SOx) can be collected and transferred to enclosed vessels or bags containing algal cultures situated in the open-oceans. The productivity of the enclosed cultures could be optimized by moving the bags to various locations in the oceans, allowing for control of temperature, irradiance, and hours of daylight. Theoretical calculations using demonstrated CO2 sequestration efficiencies and production rates of microalgal batch cultures suggest that 4 cylindrical enclosures, each with a diameter of 100 m and a depth of 40 m would be able to sequester the CO2 emitted by a 500 MW coal-fired generating plant. On a grander scale, using the same CO2 consumption rates and the enclosures described above, roughly 14,000 enclosures could reduce the CO2 in the troposphere by 1 ppm on a yearly basis, representing half of the total CO2 added to the atmosphere annually.

TI  - Ecological roles of zoosporic parasites in blue carbon ecosystems
AB  - Pathosystems describe the relationships between parasites, hosts and the environment. Generally these systems remain in a dynamic equilibrium over time. In this review we examine some of the evidence for the potential impacts of change in dynamic equilibrium in blue carbon ecosystems and the relationships to the amount of stored carbon. Blue carbon ecosystems are marine and estuarine ecosystems along the coasts. Virulent pathogens can be introduced into ecosystems along with non-native hosts. Alteration of environmental conditions, such as temperature, pH and salinity, may cause parasites to dominate the pathosystems resulting in significant decreases in productivity and population sizes of producer hosts and in changes in the overall species composition and function in these ecosystems. Such changes in blue carbon ecosystems may result in accelerated release of carbon dioxide back into the ocean and atmosphere, which could then drive further changes in the global climate. The resiliency of these ecosystems is not known. However, recent evidence suggests that significant proportions of blue carbon ecosystems have already disappeared.

TI  - Carbon migration of microalgae from cultivation towards biofuel production by hydrothermal technology: A review
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel burning are recognized as one of the major causes of climate change, particularly global warming. Thus, to reduce fossil fuels and CO2 emissions, it is essential to take preventative steps and investigate more tolerable energy options. Effective combining microalgae cultivation and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) technology can reduce CO2 emissions and the energy cost of algal biofuel production, making it more environmentally friendly. However, the carbon migration in processes must be considered prior to industry production. Therefore, this paper reviews the transformation of carbon, including the CO2 sequestration in microalgae cultivation, the carbon conversion in HTL and the CO2 emissions of algaederived biofuel. Including a summary of the conversion path and recovery of carbon, which are noticeably affected by parameters such as cultivation system, algae species, HTL reaction conditions (temperature, time and pretreatment methods) and upgrading catalyst. In addition, techno-economic assessments and environmental impact considerations on microalgae biofuel are reported.

TI  - The dynamics and stoichiometry of dissolved organic carbon release by kelp
AB  - Canopy-forming kelps are foundational species in coastal ecosystems, fixing tremendous amounts of carbon, yet we know little about the ecological and physiological determinants of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release by kelps. We examined DOC release by the bull kelp, Nereocystis luetkeana, in relation to carbon fixation, nutrient uptake, tissue nitrogen content, and light availability. DOC release was approximately 3.5 times greater during the day than at night. During the day, N. luetkeana blades released an average of 16.2\% of fixed carbon as DOC. Carbon fixation increased with light availability but DOC release did not, leading to a lower proportion of fixed carbon released as DOC at high light levels. We found no relationship between carbon fixation and DOC release rates measured concurrently. Rather, DOC release by N. luetkeana blades declined with marginal significance as blade tissue nitrogen content increased and with experimental nitrate addition, supporting the role of stoichiometric relationships in DOC release. Using a stable isotope (C-13) tracer method, we demonstrated that inorganic carbon is rapidly fixed and released by N. luetkeana blades as (DOC)-D-13, within hours. However, recently fixed carbon ((DOC)-D-13) comprised less than 20\% of the total DOC released, indicating that isotope studies that rely on tracer production alone may underestimate total DOC release, as it is decoupled from recent kelp productivity. Comparing carbon and nitrogen assimilation dynamics of the annual kelp N. luetkeana with the perennial kelp Macrocystis pyrifera revealed that N. luetkeana had significantly higher carbon fixation, DOC production and nitrogen uptake rates per unit dry mass. Both kelp species were able to perform light-independent carbon fixation at night. Carbon fixation by the annual kelp N. luetkeana is as high as 2.35 kg C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1), but an average of 16\% of this carbon (376 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) is released as DOC. As kelp forests are increasingly viewed as vehicles for carbon sequestration, it is important to consider the fate of this substantial quantity of DOC released by canopy-forming kelps.

TI  - Chemical structure investigation of tropical Turbinaria turbinata seaweeds and its derived carbon sorbents applied for the removal of hexavalent chromium in water
AB  - Biomass such as algae, has a great potential to simultaneously deliver renewable energy, bio-products and also better water quality. A pathway towards the realization of these benefits is through the development of valuable materials preferably inexpensive. This work reports on the successful exploitation of Turbinaria turbinata, a brown alga widely available in many tropical areas; which was used as sorbent for the removal of hexavalent chromium from aqueous media. By characterizing the surface material, we showed that the dried alga exhibits several polyfunctional metal-binding sites, enabled to use it as a raw material. Further surface modification (pre-treatment with acid) and structural modification (preparation of both chemically and physically activated carbons) was also carried out to enhance material adsorption properties. Significant improvement of metal uptake (up to 40 fold higher) was obtained, depending of the testing conditions. Based on a close examination of the surface chemistry and pH profiles, a mechanism describing the adsorption mechanism of the different systems was proposed.

TI  - Seagrass meadows mixed with calcareous algae have higher plant productivity and sedimentary blue carbon storage
AB  - Seagrass meadows capture and store large amounts of carbon in the sediment beneath, thereby serving as efficient sinks of atmospheric CO2. Carbon sequestration levels may however differ greatly among meadows depending on, among other factors, the plant community composition. Tropical seagrass meadows are often intermixed with macroalgae, many of which are calcareous, which may compete with seagrass for nutrients, light, and space. While the photosynthetic CO2 uptake by both seagrasses and calcareous algae may increase the overall calcification in the system (by increasing the calcium carbonate saturation state, Omega), the calcification process of calcareous algae may lead to a release of CO2, thereby affecting both productivity and calcification, and eventually also the meadows' carbon storage. This study estimated how plant productivity, CaCO3 production, and sediment carbon levels were affected by plant community composition (seagrass and calcareous algae) in a tropical seagrass-dominated embayment (Zanzibar, Tanzania). Overall, the patterns of variability in productivity differed between the plant types, with net areal biomass productivity being highest in meadows containing both seagrass and calcareous algae. Low and moderate densities of calcareous algae enhanced seagrass biomass growth, while the presence of seagrass reduced the productivity of calcareous algae but increased their CaCO3 content. Sedimentary carbon levels were highest when seagrasses were mixed with low or moderate cover of calcareous algae. The findings show that plant community composition can be an important driver for ecosystem productivity and blue carbon sequestration.

TI  - Progress and challenges in microalgal biodiesel production
AB  - The last decade has witnessed a tremendous impetus on biofuel research due to the irreversible diminution of fossil fuel reserves for enormous demands of transportation vis-a-vis escalating emissions of green house gasses (GHGs) into the atmosphere. With an imperative need of CO2 reduction and considering the declining status of crude oil, governments in various countries have not only diverted substantial funds for biofuel projects but also have introduced incentives to vendors that produce biofuels. Currently, biodiesel production from microalgal biomass has drawn an immense importance with the potential to exclude high-quality agricultural land use and food safe-keeping issues. Moreover, microalgae can grow in seawater or wastewater and microalgal oil can exceed 50-60% (dry cell weight) as compared with some best agricultural oil crops of only 5-10% oil content. Globally, microalgae are the highest biomass producers and neutral lipid accumulators contending any other terrestrial oil crops. However, there remain many hurdles in each and every step, starting from strain selection and lipid accumulation/yield, algae mass cultivation followed by the downstream processes such as harvesting, drying, oil extraction, and biodiesel conversion (transesterification), and overall, the cost of production. Isolation and screening of oleaginous microalgae is one pivotal important upstream factor which should be addressed according to the need of freshwater or marine algae with a consideration that wild-type indigenous isolate can be the best suited for the laboratory to large scale exploitation. Nowadays, a large number of literature on microalgal biodiesel production are available, but none of those illustrate a detailed step-wise description with the pros and cons of the upstream and downstream processes of biodiesel production from microalgae. Specifically, harvesting and drying constitute more than 50% of the total production costs; however, there are quite a less number of detailed study reports available. In this review, a pragmatic and critical analysis was tried to put forward with the on-going researches on isolation and screening of oleaginous microalgae, microalgal large scale cultivation, biomass harvesting, drying, lipid extraction and finally biodiesel production.

TI  - Freshwater microalgae niche of air carbon dioxide mitigation
AB  - The effectiveness of the niche of freshwater algae as a remover of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the ecosystem, and its potential to perpetuate carbon cycle are to be systematically investigated. In this study, using unsupplemented natural freshwater medium, we investigated the freshwater microalgal sequestration of atmospheric CO2 in the laboratory. The microalgal fixation of carbon, calculated by mass balance, showed that the freshwater microalgal CO2, uptake rate could reach 175 mg/L/day, with a CO2 consumption efficiency over 100\%. We found that the natural freshwater medium system achieved much higher carbon fixation efficiency than artificial media which used CO2 as the sole carbon source. This study demonstrated that in natural freshwater medium, the extent of microalgal carbon fixation transcended the substrate limitation by directly absorbing CO2 from air and thus the carbon in the microalgal biomass (100\%) was solely derived from atmosphere. Furthermore, our results suggested that the freshwater microalgal carbon fixation could account for a significant portion of the ``remaining unidentified{'' carbon sink. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Microalgae cultivation in offshore floating photobioreactor: State-of-the-art, opportunities and challenges
AB  - The wide application of microalgae in health foods, nutritional feeds, aquaculture, pharmaceutical extracts, and biofuel production, has brought about the advancement of the microalgae cultivation industry. However, commercial-scale cultivation of microalgae still faces one major challenge, which is its economic feasibility, with lower cost and energy consumption. Developing floating photobioreactors to be utilized in offshore open water areas has gained more interest recently as it can diminish the cost effects of onshore land utilization, while seeking for additional benefits, such as regulated temperature, proximity to sunlight and nutrient supplies, and integrated ocean renewable energy. Thereby, this is timely to explore the potential of floating photobioreactors for microalgae cultivation in the offshore region. This review deliberately presents the characteristics of offshore environments and their potential effects on microalgae cultivation, as factors such as location selection, heat capacity, and utilization of cultivation resources are significantly different from conventional land-based cultivation. Compared to land-based photobioreactors, the design of floating photobioreactors has the opportunity to adopt hydrodynamical design; by utilizing the external force from ocean waves to generate internal liquid sloshing for improving the mixing of cultivation medium. While offshore-based microalgae cultivation is considerably new as part of blue economy and mariculture, this review provides insights into the opportunities for further advancement of offshore microalgae cultivation technologies. The encouraging factors for hybridization of offshore microalgae cultivation include mariculture, carbon dioxide capture and utilization, hydrogen production, and ocean thermal energy. Such understandings are vital to improving microalgae cultivation in offshore floating photobioreactors towards a valuable alternative to the current concerns in developing commercial scale of the microalgae industry. Various challenges in biological issues, economic and environmental challenges, installation and maintenance, as well as destructive hydrodynamic loads are also discussed. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Ecological imperatives for aquatic CO2-concentrating mechanisms
AB  - In aquatic environments, the concentration of inorganic carbon is spatially and temporally variable and CO2 can be substantially oversaturated or depleted. Depletion of CO2 plus low rates of diffusion cause inorganic carbon to be more limiting in aquatic than terrestrial environments, and the frequency of species with a CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM), and their contribution to productivity, is correspondingly greater. Aquatic photoautotrophs may have biochemical or biophysical CCMs and exploit CO2 from the sediment or the atmosphere. Though partly constrained by phylogeny, CCM activity is related to environmental conditions. CCMs are absent or down-regulated when their increased energy costs, lower CO2 affinity, or altered mineral requirements outweigh their benefits. Aquatic CCMs are most widespread in environments with low CO2, high HCO3-, high pH, and high light. Freshwater species are generally less effective at inorganic carbon removal than marine species, but have a greater range of ability to remove carbon, matching the environmental variability in carbon availability. The diversity of CCMs in seagrasses and marine phytoplankton, and detailed mechanistic studies on larger aquatic photoautotrophs are understudied. Strengthening the links between ecology and CCMs will increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying ecological success and will place mechanistic studies in a clearer ecological context.

TI  - A sustainable process train for a marine microalga-mediated biomass production and CO2 capture: A pilot-scale cultivation of Nannochloropsis salina in open raceway ponds and harvesting through electropreciflocculation
AB  - Major challenges in cultivation, harvesting, CO2 capture and downstream processing of microalgae biomass have to be confronted for successful commercial deployment. This study explored a sustainable process train to mass-produce a native marine algal strain, Nannochloropsis salina, for biocrude production and CO2 capture. The microalga was cultivated in a 3-m2 raceway pond with manual agitation, 10-m2 raceway ponds with and without CO2 supplementation and a 120-m2 pond with CO2 supplementation using carbonation column reactor (CCR). During the above experiments, the areal productivities obtained ranged from 7.5 to 34.4 g mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1 and the lipid content was between 29 and 80%. This study also demonstrated a novel 10 KLPD (kilolitres per day) capacity electropreciflocculation (ePF) reactor (âˆ¼0.56â€“0.78 KWh/KL) and filter press for biomass harvesting with 98.24% efficiency. The CO2 capture of N. Salina estimated was in the range of 45.38â€“208.12 tons haâˆ’1 yâˆ’1, and the average was 95.39 tons haâˆ’1 yâˆ’1. The cost estimated based on the 120-m2 pond trials was $3.46/kg of dry algal biomass. Thus the findings provide immense scope for future research on large-scale cultivation of Nannochloropsis salina for biofuel production and carbon capture applications. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Strategies to improve methane content in biogas by cultivation of oleaginous microalgae and the evaluation of fuel properties of the microalgal lipids
AB  - This study aimed to improve methane content in biogas by feeding biogas through the culture of oleaginous microalgae. As oleaginous microalgae have ability to mitigate CO2 into lipids and accumulate at the content > 20\%, this process not only contributes to CO2 removal from biogas but also producing microalgal biofuel. Among the species tested, Scenedesmus sp. and marine Chlorella sp. are suitable for this purpose. However, Scenedesmus sp. was selected due to the higher CO2 removal ability and the optimized conditions were as follows: gas flow rate of 0.3 L h(-1) per 1 L- microalgal culture inoculated with 10(7) microalgal cells added with KNO3 0.8 g L-1 as nitrogen source and illuminated at 5.5 klux light intensity. Under these conditions, methane content in biogas was increased from 60\% up to > 90\% coupled with lipid productivity of 88.57 mg L-1 day(-1). With the strategy of stepwise-increasing gas flow rate to support the increasing biomass, the final biomass and lipid productivity were 1.25 and 1.79 folds increased. CO2 removal rate was as high as 5.097 g-CO2 day-1 per 1 L-microalgal culture. Fuel properties calculated based on fatty acid composition indicated high oxidation stability and high ignition quality of the microalgal lipids-derived biodiesel. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Is aquatic bioenergy with carbon capture and storage a sustainable negative emission technology? Insights from a spatially explicit environmental life-cycle assessment
AB  - It is anticipated that achievement of the Paris Climate Agreement goals will require widespread deployment of negative emission technologies (NETs). The most prominent NET is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), which is typically envisioned to use terrestrial crops as feedstock. Several recent studies have focused on aquatic BECCS (A-BECCS), making use of microalgae or macroalgae as feedstock, as possible means of reducing water and land use. However, the high logistical complexity of the A-BECCS supply chain makes it likely that regional biophysical and socio-technical factors will strongly influence its overall favorability. Therefore, this study applies life-cycle assessment (LCA) incorporating a geographic information system (GIS) framework to estimate the environmental impacts of A-BECCS over all stages of its life-cycle. Three candidate locations in the USA are evaluated based on seemingly good proximity to coastal regions and CO2 storage; namely, East Coast, West Coast, and the Gulf of Mexico. Monte Carlo simulation is used to characterize distributions of model outputs, including energy return on investment (EROI) and net global warming potential (GWP). Results reveal that only the Gulf of Mexico configuration has any likelihood of achieving both net energy production (probability of EROI 0 = 6\%), but the probability of achieving both together is very low (5\%). The other two locations exhibit net positive energy production (EROI 1), but not net negative carbon sequestration. These results call into question the feasibility of the modeled A-BECCS system as an energy-producing NET and offer insights into possible system reconfiguration. For example, anaerobic digestion offers very low EROI and creates multiple carbon-bearing waste streams, which strongly undercuts overall net CO2 sequestration. Finally, it is observed that enhanced oil recovery (EOR) strongly contributes to net-energy production (EROI > 1) in the modeled A-BECCS system, but also strongly undercuts net CO2 sequestration, which is arguably the main goal of any NET. This analysis showcases how geographically-explicit analysis can advance our understanding of biomass-based NETs.

TI  - Effective and Low-Maintenance IMTA System as Effluent Treatment Unit for Promoting Sustainability in Coastal Aquaculture
AB  - Integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA) is a versatile technology emerging as an ecological and sustainable solution for traditional monoculture aquacultures in terms of effluent treatment. Nevertheless, IMTA is still poorly applied in aquaculture industry due to, among other reasons, the lack of effective, low-investment and low-maintenance solutions. In this study, one has developed a practical and low maintenance IMTA-pilot system, settled in a semi-intensive coastal aquaculture. The optimisation and performance of the system was validated using Ulva spp., a macroalgae that naturally grows in the fishponds of the local aquaculture. Several cultivation experiments were performed at lab-scale and in the IMTA-pilot system, in static mode. The specific growth rate (SGR), yield, nutrient removal, N and C enrichment, protein and pigment content were monitored. Ulva spp. successfully thrived in effluent from the fish species sea bream (Sparus aurata) and sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) production tanks and significantly reduced inorganic nutrient load in the effluent, particularly, NH4+, PO43- and NO3-. The enrichment of nitrogen in Ulva spp.'s tissues indicated nitrogen assimilation by the algae, though, the cultivated Ulva spp. showed lower amounts of protein and pigments in comparison to the wild type. This study indicates that the designed IMTA-pilot system is an efficient solution for fish effluent treatment and Ulva spp., a suitable effluent remediator.

TI  - The effects of medium salinity on the delivery of carbon dioxide to microalgae from capture solvents using a polymeric membrane system
AB  - Efficient provision of carbon dioxide to microalgae is one of the major challenges to cost-effective large-scale cultivation. Previously, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of a novel membrane system in delivering CO2 to a marine strain of Chlorella sp. from CO2-loaded solvents. In this approach, the solvent is pumped through a non-porous hollow fibre membrane immersed in a microalgae medium, allowing passive transfer of CO2 that is utilised by the microalgae to enhance their growth, while simultaneously regenerating the solvent. In this article, we compare the growth of both fresh water and marine strains of algae using this membrane delivery system. While the fresh water medium has less pH buffering capacity and can dissolve less CO2, it proves similarly effective in delivering CO2 to the growing algae. Both the freshwater and marine species of Chlorella have slightly higher growth rates than the other species testedâ€”Dunaliella tertiolecta and Haematococcus pluvialis. However, due to the lower osmotic pressure of the fresh water medium, more water is drawn through the membrane into the solvent than when the salt water medium is used. In conclusion, while CO2 delivery through the membrane system is effective for both salt and fresh water media, better performance is obtained for the salt water medium. Â© 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Influence of Nitrogen Limitation on Lipid Accumulation and EPA and DHA Content in Four Marine Microalgae for Possible Use in Aquafeed
AB  - Microalgae are regarded as a promising alternative that can replace fishmeal and fish oil in aquaculture. Under N-limitation, many microalgae species change their carbon storage patterns in favor of neutral lipids (NLs) mainly in the form of triacylglycerol (TAG), but fatty acids in polar lipids (PL) are nutritionally more available for fish than those esterified into NLs. In the present study, the effect of N-limitation on the lipid content and fatty acid profiles in different lipid classes of Phaeodactylum tricomutum, lsochrysis aft galbana clone T-Iso, Rhodomonas baltica, and Nannochloropsis oceanica were investigated. The microalgae cells were cultivated by two different methods, batch and semi-continuous culture, to create strong and moderate N-limitation, and this in turn will significantly affect the biomass and lipid productivity. All four species accumulated lipids mainly in the form of TAG, in response to strong nitrogen limitation. N. oceanica, however, accumulated 51\% of the dry weight as lipid in moderate nitrogen limitation and up to 87\% of the fatty acid was in TAG. lsochrysis aff. galbana clone T-Iso was the only species where the fraction of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUPA), especially the fraction of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), increased with increasing nitrogen limitation. Total lipid productivity showed no increase in batch culture although stronger nitrogen limitation led to lipid accumulation. P tricomutum had the highest eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) content, while N. oceanica showed the highest EPA productivity due to the high content of lipid. The highest DHA productivity was found in Isochiysis aff. galbana clone T-Iso from moderate N-limitation, mainly due to the high biomass productivity. Based on the results from the current study, N. oceanica and T-Iso are two promising microalgae strains ass long-term sustainable sources of n-3 long chain -PUFAs under moderate N-limitation. As shown in the present study, increased lipid content in microalgal cells due to strong N-limitation induction may not increase the lipid productivity because biomass production is usually reduced. Therefore, a combination of approaches such as metabolic engineering, conditioning and selection may be needed to further increase the n-3 LC-PUFA productivity without substantial loss of biomass.

TI  - Whole System Analysis Is Required To Determine The Fate Of Macroalgal Carbon: A Systematic Review
AB  - The role of marine primary producers in capturing atmospheric CO2 has received increased attention in the global mission to mitigate climate change. Yet, our understanding of carbon sequestration performed by macroalgae has been limited to a relatively small number of studies that have estimated the ultimate fate of macroalgal-derived carbon. This systematic review was conducted to provide a timely synthesis of the methods used to determine the fate of macroalgal carbon in this rapidly expanding research area. It also aimed to provide suggestions for more effective future research. We found that the most common methods to estimate the fate of macroalgal carbon can be categorized into groups based on those that quantify: (i) export of macroalgal carbon to other environments-known as horizontal transport; (ii) sequestration of macroalgal carbon into deep-sea sediments-known as vertical transport; (iii) burial of macroalgal carbon directly beneath a benthic community; (iv) the loss of macroalgal carbon as particulate carbon or dissolved carbon to the water column; (v) the loss of macroalgal carbon to primary consumers; and finally (vi) those studies that combined multiple methods in one location. Based on this review, several recommendations for future research were formulated, which require the combination of multiple methods in a whole system analysis approach.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration in the Form of Recalcitrant Dissolved Organic Carbon in a Seaweed (Kelp) Farming Environment
AB  - Under climate change scenarios, the contribution of macroalgae to carbon sequestration has attracted wide attention. As primary producers, macroalgae can release substantial amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in seawater. However, little is known about the molecular composition and chemical properties of DOC derived from macroalgae and which of them are recalcitrant DOC (RDOC) that can be sequestered for a long time in the ocean. In the most intensive seaweed (kelp) farming area (Sanggou Bay) in China, we found that kelp mariculture not only significantly increased DOC concentration, but also introduced a variety of new DOC molecular species, many of which were sulfur-containing molecules. A long-term DOC degradation experiment revealed that those DOC with strong resistance to microbial degradation, i.e., RDOC, account for approximately 58% of the DOC extracted from kelp mariculture area. About 85% (3587 out of 4224 with different chemical features) of the RDOC molecular species were steadily present throughout the long-term degradation process. 15% (637 out of 4224 with different chemical features) of the RDOC molecular species were likely newly generated by microorganisms after metabolizing macroalgae-derived labile DOC. All these stable RDOC should be included in the blue carbon budgets of seaweed. Â© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.

TI  - Current Insights into the Molecular Mode of Action of Seaweed-Based Biostimulants and the Sustainability of Seaweeds as Raw Material Resources
AB  - Natural biostimulants, such as seaweed extracts, can stimulate plant growth and development in both model and crop plants. Due to the increasing demands for their use in agriculture, it is crucial to ensure the sustainability of the sources from which they are produced. Furthermore, some seaweed extracts were recently shown to prime and protect from adverse environmental factors such as drought, salinity and extreme temperatures, as well as from oxidative stress. The molecular mode of action of these biostimulants has still not been fully elucidated, but there has been significant progress in this direction in the last years. Firstly, this review examines the sustainability aspects of harvesting seaweed resources as raw materials for manufacturing biostimulants and provides an overview of the regulatory landscape pertaining to seaweed-based biostimulants. The review then summarises the recent advances in determining the genetic and molecular mechanisms activated by seaweed-based biostimulants, their influence on transcriptome reconfiguration, metabolite adjustment, and ultimately stress protection, improved nutrient uptake, and plant growth and performance. This knowledge is important for deciphering the intricate stress signalling network modulated by seaweed-based biostimulants and can aid in designing molecular priming technologies for crop improvement.

TI  - Novel technology in pollutant removal at source and bioremediation
AB  - Sewage disposal is a major environmental issue in both developed and developing countries and removal of pollutants such as organic matter, nutrients, heavy metals and persistent organic compounds is required to protect the environment. Novel biological systems using constructed mangrove wetland and immobilized microalgal beads have been developed as alternative systems for treating different types of sewage and pollution at source. The feasibility and efficiency of constructed mangrove wetland to remove organic matter and nutrients from primary settled municipal sewage were demonstrated through a series of greenhouse experiments and a pilot-scale field trial. The treatment efficiency of constructed mangrove wetland was comparable to, or higher than, the conventional constructed wetland. An immobilized microalgal system was developed to remove toxic persistent pollutants from industrial wastewater. Pollutant-resistant microalgal species were selected for culture in domestic wastewater. The harvested biomass was immobilized in alginate beads. Bench-scale experiments showed the algal beads were effective in removing industrial pollutants such as heavy metals (e.g. Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, etc.), organometallic compounds (e.g. tributyltin, TBT), and persistent organic compounds (e.g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs) through biosorption and biodegradation. The adsorbed metals could be recovered by desorption process, and the beads could be used repeatedly for many adsorption-desorption cycles. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The technology of cultivating salt-tolerant limnetic microalgae in seawater reduces the freshwater demand and costs of biodiesel production. However, all current trials still occur on the bench scale, and efforts for pilot-scale operation are urgently needed. This study firstly optimised the diameter of the photobioreactors (PBRs) to 0.2 m, as the single module to produce lipid-rich Golenkinia sp. SDEC-16 because of the better algal growth and light attenuation in the PBRs, and then established a 1000 L algal cultivation system. In a medium of seawater supplemented with monosodium glutamate wastewater at a ratio of 1:1000 (S-MSGW), the biomass productivity was 0.26 g/L/d, which was approaching the 0.30 g/L/d obtained in BG11, and the lipid productivity (98.99 mg/L/d) was doubled in comparison to growth in BG11. C16-C18 accounted for more than 98% of the total fatty acid in S-MSGW, and the biodiesel properties also met the biodiesel standards. The input cost of the biodiesel in this pilot-scale system was estimated to be 2.2 $/kg. When considering the carbon reduction and diversified application of the biomass, Golenkinia sp. would annually capture 186.77 kg/m3 PBR of CO2, and yield an output-to-input ratio (OIR) of 3.4 in S-MSGW, higher than the 2.8 in BG11.

TI  - How to optimise photosynthetic biogas upgrading: a perspective on system design and microalgae selection
AB  - Photosynthetic biogas upgrading using microalgae provides a promising alternative to commercial upgrading processes as it allows for carbon capture and re-use, improving the sustainability of the process in a circular economy system. A two-step absorption column-photobioreactor system employing alkaline carbonate solution and flat plate photobioreactors is proposed. Together with process optimisation, the choice of microalgae species is vital to ensure continuous performance with optimal efficiency. In this paper, in addition to critically assessing the system design and operation conditions for optimisation, five criteria are selected for choosing optimal microalgae species for biogas upgrading. These include: ability for mixotrophic growth; high pH tolerance; external carbonic anhydrase activity; high CO2 tolerance; and ease of harvesting. Based on such criteria, five common microalgae species were identified as potential candidates. Of these, Spirulina platensis is deemed the most favourable species. An industrial perspective of the technology further reveals the significant challenges for successful commercial application of microalgal upgrading of biogas, including: a significant land footprint; need for decreasing microalgae solution recirculation rate; and selecting preferable microalgae utilisation pathway.

TI  - New DOE agency targets "transformational solutions"
AB  - The U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy (ARPA-E), a new Department of Energy organization modeled on the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), has taken the first step to funding a new generation of energy technologies intended to reduce foreign oil imports and emissions of greenhouse gases. The agency announced the award of $151 million to fund 37 research projects designed to help identify transformational solutions to the energy problem. The United Technologies Research Center heads a team that aims to develop a synthetic form of carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that our bodies use to remove carbon dioxide that can capture CO2 from the flue gas streams of coal plants. A team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is developing an all-liquid battery based on cheap, domestically available liquid metals. Other projects that involve high-technology corporations include an effort by DuPont to produce the advanced biofuel biobutanol from seaweed, a sustainable source that does not require arable land or potable water.

TI  - Steam hydrogasification of microalgae for direct production of synthesis gas
AB  - Microalgae are an attractive source for production of carbonaceous matter compared to various other feedstock such as agriculture crops, vegetable oils and animal fats, lignocellulosic and forest residue. Algae have the potential for extremely rapid growth in many environments. In addition, waste and marine water can be used for cultivation of algae as the nutrients for microalgae cultivation can be obtained from wastewater particularly nitrogen and phosphorus. Microalgae can also be used to capture CO2 emissions from power plants in order to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related impacts of fossil fuel. Typical thermo-chemical processes require a process for feedstock drying. Microalgae are a wet biomass and drying high moisture content microalgae would be an energy consuming process. Steam Hydrogasification Reaction (SHR) of microalgae appears to be a promising technology for producing synthesis gas directly from microalgae. The microalgae can be gasified directly and continuously without drying, producing all the carbon into synthesis gas which then can be converted to various synthetic fuels. Presented here are results of direct gasification of algae in a Continuous Stirred-Tank Reactor (CSTR). The reactions were conducted at a temperature 750 Â°C and a pressure 400 psi. The results of these initial experiments and preliminary process modeling of the proposed integrated algae/gasification process will be presented.

TI  - Algal biorefinery towards decarbonization: Economic and environmental consideration
AB  - Algae biomass contains various biological elements, including lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates, making it a viable feedstock for manufacturing biofuels. However, the biggest obstacle to commercializing algal biofuels is their high production costs, primarily related to an algae culture. The extraction of additional high value added bioproducts from algal biomass is thus required to increase the economic viability of producing algae biofuel. This study aims to discuss the economic benefits of a zero-carbon economy and an environmentally sustainable algae resource in decarbonizing the environment through the manufacture of algal-based biofuels from algae biomass for a range of potential uses. In addition, research on the algae biorefineries, with an emphasis on case studies for various cultivation methods, as well as the commercialization of biofuel and bioenergy. Overall, the algal biorefinery offers fresh potential for synthesizing various products. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Recent Advances in Marine Microalgae Production: Highlighting Human Health Products from Microalgae in View of the Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19)
AB  - Blue biotechnology can greatly help solve some of the most serious social problems due to its wide biodiversity, which includes marine environments. Microalgae are important resources for human needs as an alternative to terrestrial plants because of their rich biodiversity, rapid growth, and product contributions in many fields. The production scheme for microalgae biomass mainly consists of two processes: (I) the Build-Up process and (II) the Pull-Down process. The Build-Up process consists of (1) the super strain concept and (2) cultivation aspects. The Pull-Down process includes (1) harvesting and (2) drying algal biomass. In some cases, such as the manufacture of algal products, the (3) extraction of bioactive compounds is included. Microalgae have a wide range of commercial applications, such as in aquaculture, biofertilizer, bioenergy, pharmaceuticals, and functional foods, which have several industrial and academic applications around the world. The efficiency and success of biomedical products derived from microalgal biomass or its metabolites mainly depend on the technologies used in the cultivation, harvesting, drying, and extraction of microalgae bioactive molecules. The current review focuses on recent advanced technologies that enhance microalgae biomass within microalgae production schemes. Moreover, the current work highlights marine drugs and human health products derived from microalgae that can improve human immunity and reduce viral activities, especially COVID-19.

TI  - Influence of seawater acidification on biochemical composition and oxidative status of green algae Ulva compressa
AB  - The sequestration of elevated atmospheric CO2 levels in seawater results in increasing acidification of oceans and it is unclear what the consequences of this will be on seaweed ecophysiology and ecological services they provide in the coastal ecosystem. In the present study, we examined the physiological and biochemical response of intertidal green seaweed Ulva compressa to elevated pCO2 induced acidification. The green seaweed was exposed to control (pH 8.1) and acidified (pH 7.7) conditions for 2 weeks following which net primary productivity, pigment content, oxidative status and antioxidant enzymes, primary and secondary metabolites, and mineral content were assessed. We observed an increase in primary productivity of the acidified samples, which was associated with increased levels of photosynthetic pigments. Consequently, primary metabolites levels were increased in the thalli grown under lowered pH conditions. There was also richness in various minerals and polyunsaturated fatty acids, indicating that the low pH elevated the nutritional quality of U. compressa. We found that low pH reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content, suggesting reduced oxidative stress. Consistently we found reduced total antioxidant capacity and a general reduction in the majority of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants in the thalli grown under acidified conditions. Our results indicate that U. compressa will benefit from seawater acidification by improving productivity. Biochemical changes will affect its nutritional qualities, which may impact the food chain/food web under future acidified ocean conditions. Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN OCEANIC FARMING OF MARINE MACROALGAE
AB  - Marine macroalgae have been collected and cultivated in nearshore areas, then processed and used, for many centuries.  By contrast, oceanic farming is a recent concept, thus far involving only a few experiments. Oceanic farming may be technically feasible but will probably be costly. Analyses reveal that oceanic farms designed as multipurpose ventures and generating a variety of products may be economically competitive. Conventional usages have included food, fodder, and fertilizer. Less-conventional usages have been considered and include production of fuels and removing atmospheric carbon dioxide by photosynthetic generation of organic matter.  Our discussion will focus on the nonconventional since these usages involve novel concepts and would consume most of the algal biomass produced by an oceanic farm. Oceanic farms involving either fuel production or CO2 regulation would necessitate very large growing areas (i.e., millions of km2) in order to achieve significant impacts in world energy markets or in ameliorating the greenhouse effect.  The tremendous size requirement would greatly exceed space available in coastal waters but could easily be accommodated in the world's oceans.

TI  - On the Atlantic pelagic Sargassum's role in carbon fixation and sequestration
AB  - The extensive blooms of the pelagic Sargassum in the Atlantic raised the question of whether this brown seaweed may play an important role in climate change mitigation through carbon fixation and carbon sequestration, as argued in several recent papers. Using simple calculations and published values on Sargassum coverage, biomass density, carbon/biomass ratio, primary productivity, and carbon sequestration efficiency, we show that the total carbon stock in pelagic Sargassum of the entire Atlantic, even during the peak month, is unlikely to exceed 3.61 Ã— 10âˆ’3 Pg C, and carbon fixation cannot exceed 6.0 million tons C monthâˆ’1. While the carbon fixation estimate represents an upper bound, it is still &lt;0.2% of carbon fixation by phytoplankton in the Atlantic Ocean. The carbon stock estimate is 2000 times lower than predicted using a machine learning model in another recent paper. In contrast, carbon sequestration by Sargassum appears significant locally within the Atlantic Sargassum belt. The analysis further suggests that, while the Atlantic pelagic Sargassum may play an important role in affecting local carbon budget and carbon sequestration, its contribution to either carbon stock or carbon sequestration at a global scale may be insignificant. This, however, does not diminish the importance of Atlantic pelagic Sargassum in many other aspects. Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Variable Impacts of Climate Change on Blue Carbon
AB  - Blue carbon provides opportunities to mitigate climate change while increasing ecosystem services for coastal communities, including climate change adaptation; however, blue carbon ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change, leading to uncertainties in the future efficacy of these ecosystems. In this review, we assess the potential impacts of climate change on blue carbon. Despite uncertainties, carbon sequestration in coastal ecosystems is enhanced by landward migration of blue carbon habitats, maintenance of sediment supply, restoration, and improved water quality. As an example, landward migration of mangroves could result in carbon sequestration of 1.5 Pg by 2100. Mudflats, seaweed beds, and coastal swamp forests could also contribute to climate change mitigation, although there are large data gaps. Achieving the full potential of blue carbon requires protection and restoration of ecosystems and facilitation of changes in ecosystem distributions with climate change, actions that will also deliver adaptation benefits. Conversely, in the worst-case coastal squeeze scenario, losses of 3.4 Pg of sequestered carbon by 2100 could occur. Â© 2020 The Authors Blue carbon is a component of nature-based climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, yet it is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Large data gaps for some blue carbon ecosystems limit projections of the impacts of climate change, but both increases and decreases in blue carbon stocks are likely outcomes. The magnitude of change in blue carbon is dependent on ecosystem type, environmental settings, and human development on coasts. Avoiding coastal squeeze is essential to maintaining blue carbon.

TI  - Allometric growth of sargassum fusiforme (Ochrophyta, fucales) organs in the maturation period based on biomass analysis of samples from gouqi island
AB  - Sargassum fusiforme is a seaweed species that plays an important role in the diverse communities of the flora and fauna of coastal food webs. Assessments of its biomass and energy allocation in addition to allometric organ growth have important ecological value for understanding the community structure, carbon storage, and resource assessment of seaweed beds during periods in which they thrive. In this study, the morphology of Sargassum fusiforme and the biomass of organs and total organisms in the maturation period were studied, and the allometric relationships for different organs of Sargassum fusiforme were analyzed using the standardized major axis (SMA). In the maturation period of Sargassum fusiforme, branch number, height Ã— stem diameter were the prior independent variables, and the optimum biomass was y = 0.002x1.107 (R2 = 0.923). The biomass allocation ratio of blades was the highest (38.33%), followed by stems (32.90%) and receptacles (28.77%). The growth rates of the various organs were found to differ, and the rate of biomass increase for the blades and stems tended to converge. The rate of receptacle biomass growth of Sargassum fusiforme was the highest in the maturation period, and the rate of organ biomass increase was Wb &lt; Ws &lt; Wt &lt; Wr, which reflects the trade-off with energy allocation as a strategy used by Sargassum fusiforme.

TI  - Efficient storage and utilization of CO2 in open raceway ponds for cultivation of microalgae
AB  - For efficient storage and utilization of CO2 in open raceway ponds, the effects of cultural and operational parameters were studied. A 10 m(2) indoors raceway pond was operated to determine CO2 storage capacity, average rate of absorbed CO2 losses and mass transfer coefficient for CO2 outgassing from various pH, salinity and alkalinity regimes of culture medium; mixing velocities and culture depths. Average rate of CO2 outgassing for saltwater (35 ppt salinity) at 40 meq/L alkalinity was 40-fold higher than seawater (35 ppt salinity and 2.3 meq/L alkalinity) at pH 8. Operating at lower pHs or salinities aggravated CO2 outgassing. An empirical equation for CO2 outgassing average mass transfer coefficient, , was developed as a function of mixing velocity and depth. Nannochloropsis sp. PTCC6016 was cultivated in the pond for 14 days. Due to higher amount of outgassing, CO2 utilization efficiency declined as the productivity in the pond decreased.

TI  - New development of technology for countermeasures against barren ground by lake bottom sediments (Super Fulvic acid iron) [Nouveau dÃ©veloppement de technologies pour les contre-mesures contre les Fonds dÃ©nudÃ©s par dÃ©pÃ´t de sÃ©diments en fond de lac (Fer super-fulvique)]
AB  - This time, our research group focused on the effect of high concentrations of fulvic acid produced at the bottom of the dam, using a high concentration fulvic acid iron elution unit, in a real sea area where barren ground is progressing. By conducting demonstration experiments on the algae field recovery of the dam reservoir, it is going to develop for the practical application of technological development for effective utilization of lake bottom deposits. We have used steelmaking slag made from blast furnace as a material to promote dissolution of divalent iron ions in the past development process, but from this time we have found more effective materials, we have manufactured from electric furnace converter A material containing high concentration divalent iron ions was adopted. This is a material containing high concentrations of divalent iron ions which is 100 times higher than the steelmaking slag that has been adopted so far. Regarding the commercialization of this research and development overseas, it is scheduled to apply in Korea the first time in East Asia. In addition, we propose a new calculation formula for CO2 absorption (carbon conversion) by seaweed bed construction, and the annual fixing by the algae of Japan is estimated to be about 3 million tons. It is expected that future development of research and development utilizing this technology will be commercialized in areas such as tidal banks as a port conservation technology and construction for forming seaweed bed and seawall maintenance etc. Research and development in this area has attracted attention as a technique for improving the quality of cultured laver as application technology in recent years, technology for restoring seaweed beds and improving the production of agricultural products in recent years.

TI  - Dissolved Iron from Steel Slag with Its Chelating Agent Promotes Seaweed Growth
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems are crucial for carbon sequestration on a global scale. However, it is unclear how we could promote and maximize carbon sequestration. Here, we demonstrate that providing an iron source to seaweed fostered its growth through increased photosynthetic efficiency and transformed the carbon into a biomass. Firstly, we revealed that the mixture of the steel slag and DTPA eluted iron dramatically in seawater. Next, we applied the eluate of the slag-DTPA pellet to the seaweed. The results for the eluate treatment showed a 25.8\% increase in the photosynthetic pigment level and a 44.9\% increase in the seaweed weight. Furthermore, we confirmed no elution of potential toxic substances from the steel slag and DTPA pellet. Finally, we applied the pellet at a depth of 15 m near seaweeds and observed a 52.0\% increase of carbon weight in the pellet treated group, while the non-treated group showed only a 10.3\% increase for five months. This study indicated that steel slag-DTPA pellet treatment induced seaweed growth and efficiently transformed its carbon into a seaweed biomass. Thus, steel slag and its chelating agent may contribute to the promotion of sea forestation and a subsequent increase in carbon sequestration known as blue carbon.

TI  - Restoring Pre-Industrial CO(2)Levels While Achieving Sustainable Development Goals
AB  - Unless humanity achieves United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 and restores the relatively stable climate of pre-industrial CO(2)levels (as early as 2140), species extinctions, starvation, drought/floods, and violence will exacerbate mass migrations. This paper presents conceptual designs and techno-economic analyses to calculate sustainable limits for growing high-protein seafood and macroalgae-for-biofuel. We review the availability of wet solid waste and outline the mass balance of carbon and plant nutrients passing through a hydrothermal liquefaction process. The paper reviews the availability of dry solid waste and dry biomass for bioenergy with CO(2)capture and storage (BECCS) while generating Allam Cycle electricity. Sufficient wet-waste biomass supports quickly building hydrothermal liquefaction facilities. Macroalgae-for-biofuel technology can be developed and straightforwardly implemented on SDG-achieving high protein seafood infrastructure. The analyses indicate a potential for (1) 0.5 billion tonnes/yr of seafood; (2) 20 million barrels/day of biofuel from solid waste; (3) more biocrude oil from macroalgae than current fossil oil; and (4) sequestration of 28 to 38 billion tonnes/yr of bio-CO2. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) costs are between 25-33\% of those for BECCS with pre-2019 technology or the projected cost of air-capture CDR.

TI  - Effects of UV-B radiation on phytoplankton and macroalgae: Adaptation strategies
AB  - Recent results continue to indicate ozone depletion-related increases in solar ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B; 280 - 315 nm) reaching the Earth's surface. Harmful doses of UV-B radiation can penetrate deep (up to several dozen meters) into the water column and may thus affect aquatic ecosystems. Aquatic ecosystems are key components of the Earth's biosphere since they produce more than 50 \% of the biomass on our planet. Phytoplankton and macroalgae are the major biomass producers and form the basis of the aquatic food webs. The highly energetic UV-B has the greatest potential for cell damage caused by both direct effects on DNA and proteins and indirect effects via the production of reactive oxygen species. UV-B can cause wide ranging damage such as reduction in development and reproduction resulting in loss of productivity of phytoplankton and macroalgae. Consequences of loss of productivity are reduced sink capacity for atmospheric CO2 and negative effects on species diversity, ecosystem stability, trophic interactions and ultimately biogeochemical cycles. However, a number of species have developed various adaptation strategies to counteract the-damaging effects of UV-B. These strategies include vertical migration within the water column, repair of DNA damage and production of UV-absorbing/screening mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs). This article deals with the effects of UV-B radiation on phytoplankton and macroalgae and the adaptation strategies applied by them to reduce the negative effects of UV-B.

TI  - Power, fresh water, and food from cold, deep sea water
AB  - Many times more solar heat energy accumulates in the vast volume of warm tropic seas than that produced by all of our power plants. The looming energy crisis causes a renewal of interest in utilizing this stored solar heat to give, in addition to electric power, vast quantities of fresh water. Warm surface water, when evaporated, generates steam, to power a turbine, then fresh water when the steam is condensed by the cold water. A great increase in revenues over that from power and fresh water is shown by a substantial mariculture pilot plant. Deep sea water contains large quantities of nutrients. These feed algae which feed shellfish, ultimately shrimps and lobsters, in shallow ponds. Wastes grow seaweed of value; and combined revenues from desalination, power generation, and mariculture will give substantial profit.

TI  - Evaluation of biogas production from seaweed in batch tests and in UASB reactors combined with the removal of heavy metals
AB  - Seaweed can be anaerobically digested for the production of energy-rich methane. However, the use of seaweed digestate as a fertilizer may be restricted because of the high heavy metal content especially cadmium. Reducing the concentration of heavy metals in the digestate will enable its use as a fertilizer. In this laboratory-scale study, the potential of seaweed and its leachate in the production of methane were evaluated in batch tests. The effect of removing the heavy metals from seaweed leachate was evaluated in both batch test and treatment in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor. The heavy metals were removed from seaweed leachate using an imminodiacetic acid (IDA) polyacrylamide cryogel carrier. The methane yield obtained in the anaerobic digestion of seaweed was 0.12 N I CH4/g VSadded. The same methane yield was obtained when the seaweed leachate was used for methane production. The IDA-cryogel carrier was efficient in removing Cd2+, Cu2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+ ions from seaweed leachate. The removal of heavy metals in the seaweed leachate led to a decrease in the methane yield. The maximum sustainable organic loading rate (OLR) attained in the UASB reactor was 20.6 g tCOD/l/day corresponding to a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 12 h and with a total COD removal efficiency of about 81\%. Hydrolysis and treatment with IDA cryogel reduced the heavy metals content in the seaweed leachate before methane production. This study also demonstrated the suitability of the treatment of seaweed leachate in a UASB reactor. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - ORGANIC-CARBON SOURCES AND SINKS IN SAN-FRANCISCO BAY - VARIABILITY INDUCED BY RIVER FLOW
AB  - Sources and sinks of organic carbon for San Francisco Bay (California, USA) were estimated for 1980. Sources for the southern reach were dominated by phytoplankton and benthic microalgal production. River loading of organic matter was an additional important factor in the northern reach. Tidal marsh export and point sources played a secondary role. Autochthonous production in San Francisco Bay appears to be less than the mean for temperate-zone estuaries, primarily because turbidity limits microalgal production and the development of seagrass beds. Exchange between the Bay and Pacific Ocean plays an unknown but potentially important role in the organic carbon balance. Interannual variability in the organic carbon supply was assessed for Suisun Bay, a northern reach subembayment that provides habitat for important fish species (delta smelt Hypomesus transpacificus and larval striped bass Morone saxatilus). The total supply fluctuated by an order of magnitude; depending on the year, either autochthonous sources (phytoplankton production) or allochthonous sources (riverine loading) could be dominant. The primary cause of the year-to-year change was variability of freshwater inflows from the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, and its magnitude was much larger than long-term changes arising from marsh destruction and point source decreases. Although interannual variability of the total organic carbon supply could not be assessed for the southern reach, year-to-year changes in phytoplankton production were much smaller than in Suisun Bay, reflecting a relative lack of river influence.

TI  - Reaction engineering and kinetics of algae conversion to biofuels and chemicals via pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction
AB  - Algae are becoming increasingly popular as feedstocks for various fine chemicals and fuel intermediates. Cultivation of algae can be environment-friendly as they can fix high amounts of carbon dioxide in the environment, and also remove hazardous pollutants from wastewater. Moreover, algae cultivation presents a high per-hectare oil yield and faster growth rates than terrestrial biomasses. Owing to these advantages, algae are attractive candidates for harnessing energy. Thermochemical conversion techniques are promising as they offer a single-step conversion of algae species into valuable chemicals. In this article, pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction technologies for the conversion of a variety of microalgae and macroalgae to bio-oil and biochemicals are discussed comprehensively. Different pyrolysis strategies such as fast pyrolysis, co-pyrolysis, microwave-assisted pyrolysis, and hydropyrolysis for the production of bio-oil of varying properties are outlined. The effect of catalysts in upgrading the quality of the bio-oil is evaluated. On the hydrothermal liquefaction front, the effects of operating parameters such as temperature, time, pressure, and solvent on the yields of products and the quality of bio-crude are covered in detail. Due emphasis is given to the kinetics of pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction of algae, and different types of models, viz., apparent kinetics and lumped semi-detailed models, are discussed. The complex conversion pathways involved in these two processes are unraveled by presenting plausible reaction mechanisms and discussing the fate of nitrogen present in the algae. Furthermore, this review throws light on various aspects ranging from algae cultivation, the effect of culture conditions on the biochemical composition of algae species to techno-economic and lifecycle assessment of biofuels and chemicals derived from algae via thermochemical technologies. Finally, the challenges involved in the scale-up of thermochemical technologies and the development of detailed kinetic models are presented.

TI  - An informatics-based analysis of developments to date and prospects for the application of microalgae in the biological sequestration of industrial flue gas
AB  - The excessive emission of flue gas contributes to air pollution, abnormal climate change, global warming, and sea level rises associated with glacial melting. With the ability to utilize NOx as a nitrogen source and to convert solar energy into chemical energy via CO2 fixation, microalgae can potentially reduce air pollution and relax global warming, while also enhancing biomass and biofuel production as well as the production of high-value-added products. This informatics-based review analyzes the trends in the related literature and in patent activity to draw conclusions and to offer a prospective view on the developments of microalgae for industrial flue gas biosequestration. It is revealed that in recent years, microalgal research for industrial flue gas biosequestration has started to attract increasing attention and has now developed into a hot research topic, although it is still at a relatively early stage, and needs more financial and policy support in order to better understand microalgae and to develop an economically viable process. In comparison with onsite microalgal CO2 capture, microalgae-based biological DeNOx appears to be a more realistic and attractive alternative that could be applied to NOx treatment.

TI  - Marine biotechnology: Realizing the potential
AB  - Marine biotechnology is an applied science, the goal of which is to develop goods and services from marine organisms and processes. The new wave of marine biotechnology research began in the early 1980s and includes some significant success stories. A new drug to manage pain is commercially available, and a new cancer drug has been recommended for approval, the first from a fish-eating snail and the second from a mangrove tunicate. Enzymes from hydrothermal vent microbes are routinely used in PCR reactions, and marine-derived molecular probes are helping understand the molecular basis of disease processes. Advances in aquaculture biotechnology have resulted in more efficient production of finfish and shellfish for human consumption, and polyunsaturated fatty acids from marine microalgae are used as nutritional supplements for adults and infants. Rapid diagnostic tools have been developed to monitor toxins in the environment and in seafood, and genetic fingerprinting techniques are helping to control illegal trade of threatened marine species. In the future, multidisciplinary programs in oceans and human health should focus not only on microbial pathogens and harmful algal bloom toxins but also on discovery of new chemicals to prevent or treat human diseases. And the development of biological and biochemical sensors to detect pathogens, contaminants, and toxins and to monitor human and environmental health indicators in the marine environment should be a very high priority in the establishment of U.S. coastal ocean observing systems.

TI  - Biomass composition of the golden tide pelagic seaweeds Sargassum fluitans and S. natans (morphotypes I and VIII) to inform valorisation pathways
AB  - Massive strandings of the pelagic brown algae Sargassum have occurred in the Caribbean, and to a lesser extent, in western Africa, almost every year since 2011. These events have major environmental, health, and economic impacts in the affected countries. Once on the shore, Sargassum is mechanically harvested and disposed of in landfills. Existing commercial applications of other brown algae indicate that the pelagic Sargassum could constitute a valuable feedstock for potential valorisation. However, limited data on the composition of this Sargassum biomass was available to inform on possible application through pyrolysis or enzymatic fractionation of this feedstock. To fill this gap, we conducted a detailed comparative biochemical and elemental analysis of three pelagic Sargassum morphotypes identified so far as forming Atlantic blooms: Sargassum natans I (SnI), S. fluitans III (Sf), and S. natans VIII (SnVIII). Our results showed that SnVIII accumulated a lower quantity of metals and metalloids compared to SnI and Sf, but it contained higher amounts of phenolics and non-cellulosic polysaccharides. SnVIII also had more of the carbon storage compound mannitol. No differences in the content and composition of the cell wall polysaccharide alginate were identified among the three morphotypes. In addition, enzymatic saccharification of SnI produced more sugars compared to SnVIII and Sf. Due to high content of arsenic, the use of pelagic Sargassum is not recommended for nutritional purposes. In addition, low yields of alginate extracted from this biomass, compared with brown algae used for industrial production, limit its use as viable source of commercial alginates. Further work is needed to establish routes for future valorisation of pelagic Sargassum biomass. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Superficial sedimentary stocks and sources of carbon and nitrogen in coastal vegetated assemblages along a flow gradient
AB  - Coastal vegetated ecosystems are major organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) sinks, but the mechanisms that regulate their spatial variability need to be better understood. Here we assessed how superficial sedimentary OC and TN within intertidal vegetated assemblages (saltmarsh and seagrass) vary along a flow gradient, which is a major driver of sediment grain size, and thus of organic matter (OM) content. A significant relationship between flow current velocity and OC and TN stocks in the seagrass was found, but not in the saltmarsh. OC and TN stocks of the saltmarsh were larger than the seagrass, even though that habitat experiences shorter hydroperiods. Mixing models revealed that OM sources also varied along the flow gradient within the seagrass, but not in the saltmarsh, showing increasing contributions of microphytobenthos (17â€“32%) and decreasing contributions of POM (45â€“35%). As well, OM sources varied vertically as microphytobenthos contribution was highest at the higher intertidal saltmarsh (48%), but not POM (39%). Macroalgae, seagrass and saltmarsh showed low contributions. Local trade-offs between flow current velocities, hydroperiod and structural complexity of vegetation must be considered, at both horizontal and vertical (elevation) spatial dimensions, for better estimates of blue carbon and nitrogen in coastal ecosystems.
