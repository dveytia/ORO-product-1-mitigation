TI  - Ocean iron fertilization: Time to lift the research taboo
AB  - Introduction. Today, most countries have accepted a 2 degrees Celsius temperature increase above preindustrial levels as the maximum tolerable limit for global warming. An exceedance probability of below 20 percent for this limit implies an emission budget of less than 250 GtC from 2000 until 2049, however, extrapolating from current global CO2 emissions, this budget will only last until 2024. This sobering math should wake us up to the reality that all options, including climate engineering, need to be considered to address climate change. Climate engineering options can be classified broadly into two categories: solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal measures. Solar radiation management schemes seek to decrease the incoming solar radiation or to increase the reflection of incoming solar radiation. These approaches can generate fast climate responses, but do not immediately address the cause of the problem. Carbon dioxide removal measures seek to decrease atmospheric carbon concentrations by enhancing or substituting natural carbon sinks. The terrestrial carbon sink can be enhanced by means of forestation; the oceanic sink may, in some regions, be enhanced by means of fertilization, for example by artificially enhanced upwelling of macronutrients or by purposeful addition of the micronutrient iron; the mineral carbon sink can be enhanced by means of chemically accelerated weathering. Some analysts have expressed doubts about the potential of mitigating climate change by sink enhancement, because of concerns about whether carbon can be stored permanently. Nevertheless, terrestrial vegetation sinks have entered the Kyoto Protocol (KP) as offsets for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, but ocean sinks have not. Â© Cambridge University Press 2013.

TI  - The value of scientific research on the ocean's biological carbon pump
AB  - The ocean's biological carbon pump (BCP) sequesters carbon from the surface to the deep ocean and seabed, constituting one of Earth's most valuable ecosystem services. Significant uncertainty exists surrounding the amounts and rates of organic carbon sequestered in the oceans, however. With improved understanding of BCP sequestration, especially its scale, world policymakers would be positioned to make more informed decisions regarding the mitigation of carbon emissions. Here, an analytical model of the economic effects of global carbon emissionsâ€”including scientific uncertainty about BCP sequestrationâ€”was developed to estimate the value of marine scientific research concerning sequestration. The discounted net economic benefit of a putative 20-year scientific research program to narrow the range of uncertainty around the amount of carbon sequestered in the ocean is on the order of $0.5 trillion (USD), depending upon the accuracy of predictions, the convexities of climate damage and economic output functions, and the initial range of uncertainty.

TI  - Reforming International Fisheries Law Can Increase Blue Carbon Sequestration
AB  - The oceans are by far the largest carbon sink and are estimated to have absorbed roughly 40 percent of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions since the beginning of the industrial era. The climate services performed by the oceans can be described as an interaction between a physical and a biological carbon pump. Whereas the role of the physical carbon pump is well established, the full scale of the climate services provided by the biological carbon pump has only recently been understood. This pump is made up of services provided by different marine species, from microbes to marine mammals. Many of these species are managed under the international law of the sea and subject to the concept of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). Although the MSY concept has developed since its inception, maximum generation of fish for human consumption remains the core objective according to the law of the sea. Under MSY based management, states are not required to consider the climate services represented by different marine organisms, making this regime unable to balance the interest of maximizing fish as a product against the oceansâ€™ role in carbon sequestration. In order to make optimal use of the carbon sequestering features of marine organisms, this perspective proposes five action points. Foremost, MSY should be complemented with a new management objective: maximum carbon sequestration (MCS). Although many aspects of climate-based fisheries management remain to be explored, it appears clear that this would imply allowing stocks to recover to maintain a larger amount of biomass, increasing conservation measures for species particularly efficient in providing negative emissions, differentiation of fisheries within species as well as a new approach to ecosystem management. Climate reforming international fisheries law could make an important contribution to the operationalization of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, as well as the UN Sustainable Development Goals. As a first step, international guidelines should be developed on how to integrate the concept of maximum carbon sequestration in fisheries management.

TI  - Designing the next generation of ocean iron fertilization experiments
AB  - The first generation of open-ocean iron enrichments (1993 to 2005) have all had broadly the same design. Enrichment of patches of ocean was typically on a 10 km length-scale, and experiments were of a duration of weeks. These scales were dictated by what could conveniently be achieved from research vessels, using tracers to track Lagrangian patches. The extrapolation of experimental findings to the larger scales required for carbon sequestration by ocean iron fertilization (OIF) leaves many uncertainties, to answer which, longer duration (i.e. months) and larger scale observations (100 to 200 km length-scale) are required. However, to extrapolate to a timescale of decades and to the scale of ocean basins, such observations must be conducted in parallel (and where possible assimilated into) detailed models of the physics and biogeochemistry of the fertilized waters. Our present understanding suggests that any carbon sequestration will occur as the net result of changes in the air-sea flux integrated over millions km(2) and many years, and can only realistically be assessed by modelling. A central role of the observational studies will be to make such models as accurate as possible in their simulations and predictions. We present a scheme for the design of a second generation of ocean iron-enrichments and discuss the challenges that are evident in linking the modelling and observational components of such studies.

TI  - A new look at ocean carbon remineralization for estimating deepwater sequestration
AB  - The biological carbon pump causes carbon sequestration in deep waters by downward transfer of organic matter, mostly as particles. This mechanism depends to a great extent on the uptake of CO2 by marine plankton in surface waters and subsequent sinking of particulate organic carbon (POC) through the water column. Most of the sinking POC is remineralized during its downward transit, and modest changes in remineralization have substantial feedback on atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but little is known about global variability in remineralization. Here we assess this variability based on modern underwater particle imaging combined with field POC flux data and discuss the potential sources of variations. We show a significant relationship between remineralization and the size structure of the phytoplankton assemblage. We obtain the first regionalized estimates of remineralization in biogeochemical provinces, where these estimates range between -50 and +100\% of the commonly used globally uniform remineralization value. We apply the regionalized values to satellite-derived estimates of upper ocean POC export to calculate regionalized and ocean-wide deep carbon fluxes and sequestration. The resulting value of global organic carbon sequestration at 2000m is 0.33PgCyr(-1), and 0.72PgCyr(-1) at the depth of the top of the permanent pycnocline, which is up to 3 times higher than the value resulting from the commonly used approach based on uniform remineralization and constant sequestration depth. These results stress that variable remineralization and sequestration depth should be used to model ocean carbon sequestration and feedback on the atmosphere.

TI  - Global climate change and carbon management in multifunctional forests
AB  - Fossil-fuel burning and deforestation have emerged as principal anthropogenic sources of rising atmospheric CO2 and consequential global warming. Variability in temperature, precipitation, snow cover, sea level and extreme weather events provide collateral evidence of global climate change. I review recent advances on causes and consequences of global climate change and its impact on nature and society. I also examine options for climate change mitigation. Impact of climate change on ecology, economy and society the three pillars of sustainability - is increasing. Emission reduction, although most useful, is also politically sensitive for economic reasons. Proposals of the geoengineering for iron fertilization of oceans or manipulation of solar flux using stratospheric scatters are yet not feasible for scientific and environmental reasons. Forests as carbon sinks, therefore, are required to play a multifunctional role that includes, but is not limited to, biodiversity conservation and maintenance of ecosystem functions; yield of goods and services to the society; enhancing the carbon storage in trees, woody vegetation and soils; and providing social and economic well-being of people. This paper explores strategies in that direction and concludes that the management of multifunctional forests over landscape continuum, employing tools of conservation biology and restoration ecology, shall be the vital option for climate change mitigation in future.

TI  - Sequestration of carbon dioxide by ocean fertilization
AB  - Sequestration of carbon dioxide to the deep ocean by the fertilization of high nutrient, low chlorophyll (HNLC) ocean waters can be an answer to the concerns arising from the increasing carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere. This approach has the potential to sequester carbon dioxide for 1000 to 2000 years for a cost of about $2.00/ton of carbon dioxide. A technology demonstration is planned to fertilize an area of 5,000 square miles of the equatorial Pacific that is expected to sequester between 600,000 and 2,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide in a period of 20 days. The ecological changes expected consist of the increase in diatoms, which double or triple each day until the limiting fertilizing element is used up. No adverse changes are expected, since this is exactly what happens naturally when episodic fertilization occurs in the open ocean. The concept is that fertilization of HNLC waters with chelated iron will cause a bloom of phytoplankton that sink below the thermocline into deep water due to their high density after they die. The experiment, while large by land comparisons, is small in terms of ocean area, about one square degree at the equator. The demonstration protocol will include measurements of the amount of carbon dioxide that is removed from the surface layer and the amount of organic carbon that is produced and exported to the ocean depths as well as other effects in the water column over a period of 20 days. After this time no further effects of iron fertilization are expected to take place because macronutrient elements (N, P and Si) are depleted to limiting concentrations. Since the iron enrichment is transient, no steady-state modification of the food web will occur. The experiment will be carried out outside the EEZ of any nation, as were the previous five experimental voyages, so, like them, no permits will be required. The five recent ocean experiments observed iron stimulation of phytoplankton growth, but the effects were difficult to quantify in the 9 to 28 square mile experiments since eddy diffusion along the edges of the patch diluted the bloom. This problem will be minimized in the planned technology demonstration because its larger area restricts the diffusion from the center of the patch to less than 2% of the concentration over the 20 day period of the test.

TI  - Shifts in biogenic carbon flow from particulate to dissolved forms under high carbon dioxide and warm ocean conditions
AB  - Photosynthesis by phytoplankton in sunlit surface waters transforms inorganic carbon and nutrients into organic matter, a portion of which is subsequently transported vertically through the water column by the process known as the biological carbon pump (BCP). The BCP sustains the steep vertical gradient in total dissolved carbon, thereby contributing to net carbon sequestration. Any changes in the vertical transportation of the organic matter as a result of future climate variations will directly affect surface ocean carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, and subsequently influence oceanic uptake of atmospheric CO2 and climate. Here we present results of experiments designed to investigate the potential effects of ocean acidification and warming on the BCP. These perturbation experiments were carried out in enclosures (3,000 L volume) in a controlled mesocosm facility that mimicked future pCO2 (âˆ¼900 ppmv) and temperature (3C higher than ambient) conditions. The elevated CO2 and temperature treatments disproportionately enhanced the ratio of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production to particulate organic carbon (POC) production, whereas the total organic carbon (TOC) production remained relatively constant under all conditions tested. A greater partitioning of organic carbon into the DOC pool indicated a shift in the organic carbon flow from the particulate to dissolved forms, which may affect the major pathways involved in organic carbon export and sequestration under future ocean conditions.

AB  - The ocean, being the largest carbon reservoir on the Earth surface, plays an irreplaceable role in regulating climate change and also has great potential for negative emissions. Here, we briefly review the ocean carbon storage processes and mechanisms that have been recognized to date, including the solubility pump (SP), carbonate counter pump (CCP), biological carbon pump (BCP), and microbial carbon pump (MCP). However, several scientific questions remain: How is the huge dissolved organic carbon pool in the ocean formed? What are the biogeochemical processes and regulatory mechanisms of the ocean carbon sink? How are they involved in regulating climate change? Three scientific hypotheses are thus proposed: The MCP is the main mechanism responsible for the formation of the oceanic organic carbon pool; the spatial and temporal partitioning of the MCP and the BCP substantially regulates the carbon source-sink patterns; the MCP amplifies the climate effects induced by changes of the Earthâ€™s orbital parameters. Synthesis of the three hypotheses on spatial and temporal scales can lead to a more general scientific hypothesis: The MCP is a two-way regulator of climate change, that is, it can both accumulate an ocean carbon sink under a high CO2 environment and thus slow down global warming and also release CO2 after an â€œice ageâ€ contributing to the return of a warm world. Toward address these hypotheses, the following research contents should be conducted: (1) The roles of key microbial functional groups in representative marine environments and their contributions to marine carbon sink, including production, decomposition, transformation, and sequestration of dissolved and particulate organic carbon; (2) the evolution, physical-biogeochemical regulation, and environmental effects of carbon source-sink patterns in the China Seas, including the quantification of the seaâ€“atmosphere CO2 flux and its evolution at marginal seas, the physical and biogeochemical processes and mechanisms controlling the carbon cycle and a comparison of BCP, MCP, and the impacts of carbon cycling processes on eutrophication, acidification, and anoxia formation; and (3) the responses and feedbacks of ocean carbon sinks to climate change, linking the changes in ocean carbon pools with the ice age cyclone, exploring boundary conditions for MCP, BCP, and CCP processes toward potential maximum outputs of carbon sequestration. We recommend working toward integration of the coupled carbon storage mechanisms of MCP, BCP, and CCP through cross-disciplinary research, which would overcome the limitation of considering only individual carbon storage mechanisms and facilitate maximization of ocean carbon storage. For example, the coating and aggregation effects of RDOC on POC shows the synergistic effects of MCP with BCP; the role of RDOC as condensation nuclei and the increase of alkalinity during microbial processes shows the synergistic effects of MCP with BCP; the sinking and production of CaCO3 of Coccolithophores and Foraminifera shows the synergistic effects of BCP with CCP. Simultaneously, a theoretical system of ocean carbon storage based on the concepts of ecological balance and sustainable development will form and may serve as a key to interpreting climate change and an effective way to understand the past and predict the future of global climate.

TI  - Ocean iron fertilization
AB  - Ocean iron fertilization is the natural or anthropogenic action of adding the element iron to oceanic surface waters. Of the several international iron fertilization experiments, and many naturally observed enrichment phenomena, the general features of these enrichments are: Enhanced photosynthetic energy conversion and phytoplankton growth, a shift in the microbial species composition, nutrient and carbon dioxide uptake and in some cases, enhanced nitrogen fixation. From these observations, historical variations in iron supply to the oceans have been mechanistically linked to glacial and interglacial climates. Today, as atmospheric carbon dioxide climbs above 400 ppm and damaging consequences of climate change are now observed globally, the role of iron fertilization as a carbon sequestration/geoengineering strategy has received increasing attention. Because there have been no large-scale experiments to test the efficacy nor examine unintended consequences of such a massive fertilization effort, however, the utility of such an approach remains relatively unexamined and changing ocean chemistry may limit its effectiveness.

TI  - Assessment of the evolution of water-column stratification following the hypothetical implementation of widespread controlled upwelling in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre
AB  - The concept of widespread controlled upwelling proposed by Karl and Letelier (2008; Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 364:257-268) is examined in a time-domain one-dimensional advection diffusion model of the oceanic water column for conditions representative of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG). Temperature is a proxy for potential density. When unstable stratification occurs in the time-stepping numerical algorithm, local homogenization is allowed to mimic buoyancy-driven mixing. Steady-state as well as time-varying solutions of the temperature field are calculated under various upwelling scenarios. Results suggest that upwelling rates exceeding the model's background vertical advection rate (â‰ˆ 4 m yr -1) would profoundly affect upper ocean stratification. With large upwelling rates, the temporary cooling of the mixed layer would trigger a large compensating heat input from the atmosphere. High downward return advection rates associated with the controlled upwelling process would then transport this heat to deeper layers. In the long run, a net ocean warming would occur as well as a deepening of the mixed layer. This suggests that the potential carbon sequestration benefits from widespread controlled upwelling across the NPSG are unlikely to exceed 0.1 Gt C yr -1. Finally, it is argued that Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) electricity production throughout the NPSG should be considered for comparative purposes since OTEC also would use large amounts of deep seawater. For comparable flow rates, it is shown that OTEC systems would provide a much more effective atmospheric carbon control tool if they replaced fossil-fuel thermal power plants.

TI  - Iron-Marine Algal Interactions and Impacts: Decreasing Global Warming by Increasing Algal Biomass
AB  - Iron limitation in vast water bodies has been linked to decreased algal productivity, despite different iron-acquiring mechanisms, and the presence of ferritin in many algal species that act as an iron internal reservoir. Therefore, iron fertilization has been proposed to increase algal biomass and photosynthesis. This, in turn, will reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and increase oxygen, thereby decreasing global warming, and achieving ecological balance. In addition, algal proliferation will hopefully lead to enhancement in biodiversity, Biological pump, fish productivity and, subsequently marine food industry. Many climate geoengineering experiments in the form of ocean iron fertilization have been conducted globally in order to achieve such a purpose. However, reservations remain as the outcomes are not as promising as were previously expected. As the temporal and spatial scales of iron fertilization experiments are limited, the effects on fish productivity remain speculative. On the other hand, side effects were also recorded. The main purpose of iron fertilization, for carbon dioxide sequestration and global warming mitigation, still remains to be fully realized and verified. Several improvements and future modifications are suggested, and legal issues are discussed in this review.

TI  - Spatial variability of upper ocean POC export in the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean determined using particle-reactive Th-234
AB  - The northern Indian Ocean is globally significant for its seasonally reversing winds, upwelled nutrients, high biological production, and expanding oxygen minimum zones. The region acts as sink and source for atmospheric CO2. However, the efficiency of the biological carbon pump to sequester atmospheric CO2 and export particulate organic carbon from the surface is not well known. To quantify the upper ocean carbon export flux and to estimate the efficiency of biological carbon pump in the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean, seawater profiles of total Th-234 were measured from surface to 300 m depth at 13 stations from 19.9 degrees N to 25.3 degrees S in a transect along 87 degrees E, during spring intermonsoon period (March-April 2014). Results showed enhanced in situ primary production in the equatorial Indian Ocean and the central Bay of Bengal and varied from 13.2 to 173.8 mmol C m(-2) d(-1). POC export flux in this region varied from 0 to 7.7 mmol C m(-2) d(-1). Though high carbon export flux was found in the equatorial region, remineralization of organic carbon in the surface and subsurface waters considerably reduced organic carbon export in the Bay of Bengal. Annually recurring anticyclonic eddies enhanced organic carbon utilization and heterotrophy. Oxygen minimum zone developed due to stratification and poor ventilation was intensified by subsurface remineralization. Th-234-based carbon export fluxes were not comparable with empirical statistical model estimates based on primary production and temperature. Region-specific refinement of model parameters is required to accurately predict POC export fluxes.

TI  - Metrics that matter for assessing the ocean biological carbon pump
AB  - The biological carbon pump (BCP) comprises wide-ranging processes that set carbon supply, consumption, and storage in the oceans' interior. It is becoming increasingly evident that small changes in the efficiency of the BCP can significantly alter ocean carbon sequestration and, thus, atmospheric CO2 and climate, as well as the functioning of midwater ecosystems. Earth system models, including those used by the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, most often assess POC (particulate organic carbon) flux into the ocean interior at a fixed reference depth. The extrapolation of these fluxes to other depths, which defines the BCP efficiencies, is often executed using an idealized and empirically based flux-vs.-depth relationship, often referred to as the ``Martin curve.{''} We use a new compilation of POC fluxes in the upper ocean to reveal very different patterns in BCP efficiencies depending upon whether the fluxes are assessed at a fixed reference depth or relative to the depth of the sunlit euphotic zone (Ez). We find that the fixed-depth approach underestimates BCP efficiencies when the Ez is shallow, and vice versa. This adjustment alters regional assessments of BCP efficiencies as well as global carbon budgets and the interpretation of prior BCP studies. With several international studies recently underway to study the ocean BCP, there are new and unique opportunities to improve our understanding of the mechanistic controls on BCP efficiencies. However, we will only be able to compare results between studies if we use a common set of Ez-based metrics.

TI  - Evaluating the effectiveness of artificial marine structures as upwelling-generators to enhance oceanic CO2 sinks
AB  - This chapter evaluates the effectiveness of an artificial marine structure as an upwell-generator to enhance oceanic CO2 sequestration in the coastal areas of Japan. Results suggest that the processes responsible for vertical mixing between shallow waters and bottom waters were vertical shear of currents, internal wave breaking, and entrainment. It also found evidence that neap tides may enhance the mixing. The upwelling generated by the artificial marine structure, increased nutrient supply to the shallow layer. Coccoid pico-cyanobacteria represented about 25% to 30% of the total biomass produced during incubation. Diatoms of small size were abundant, among which Chaetoceros compressum and other Chaetoceros species predominated. Net organic production estimated over the year is 470 gC m-2 yr-1 using 1300 mgC m-2 day-1. This value is the same order of magnitude as net organic production in temperate forests and mangroves. This, together with the contribution from forestation, could help enable Japan to reach its CO2-reduction target as set in the Kyoto Protocol. It is concluded that the use of marine biota, natural energy and this artificial upwelling system contributes effectively to increased CO2 fixation. Â© 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Loser: Climate engineering algae bloom climate-change scheme doomed
AB  - Planktos, an organization that spreads iron dust over great swaths of the ocean and as a sideline, grows forests to be sold as carbon offsets to those wishing to counterbalance their greenhouse gas emissions. The idea behind the iron dust scheme is that, the element is an important ingredient that determines how much phytoplankton can grow on some regions of the ocean's surface. As it grows, they pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it into organic carbon. Carbon extracted from the atmosphere through iron fertilization holds the promise of solving the problem of climate change. By design, iron fertilization would modify the biological processes at work in the ocean. However, top on the list of side effect is the possibility that an increase in carbon sequestration might cause other parts of the ocean to release more nitrous oxide. Still, the firm contends that the amount of plankton has lessened and that the offsets they use will restore it.

TI  - Feasibility of ocean fertilization and its impact on future atmospheric CO2 levels
AB  - Iron fertilization of macronutrient-rich but biologically unproductive ocean waters has been proposed for sequestering anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2). The first carbon export measurements in the Southern Ocean (SO) during the recent SO-Iron Experiment (SOFeX) yielded âˆ¼900 t C exported per 1.26 t Fe added. This allows the first realistic, data-based feasibility assessment of large-scale iron fertilization and corresponding future atmospheric CO2 prognosis. Using various carbon cycle models, we find that if 20% of the world's surface ocean were fertilized 15 times per year until year 2100, it would reduce atmospheric CO2 by â‰²15 ppmv at an expected level of âˆ¼700 ppmv for business-as-usual scenarios. Thus, based on the SOFeX results and currently available technology, large-scale oceanic iron fertilization appears not a feasible strategy to sequester anthropogenic CO2.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration Through Oceanic Fe Fertilization: Opportunity for Mine Water?
AB  - John Martin first proposed the iron hypothesis in 1990 which suggests that ocean iron concentrations impact phytoplankton growth which impact global climate. Subsequent experiments have confirmed this hypothesis and demonstrated unique ocean conditions that are suited for sequestering atmospheric carbon and increasing the productivity of local food chains. In this paper, we review the literature of ocean iron fertilization experiments and perform calculations to evaluate the opportunity for using mine drainage by-products in future geoengineering proposals.

TI  - Introduction and synthesis
AB  - A historical perspective of the scientific study of ocean iron fertilization (OIF) over the last 15 yr prefaces a short synthesis of the multi-faceted issues raised by the 11 contributions to this Theme Section. These issues, which range from ethical to logistical, must be aired in discussions surrounding OIF and its commercial application as a potential climate mitigation tool. Two other issues, not considered in detail by the contributors, are also addressed: (1) the importance of the rate of change in atmospheric CO 2 following sustained global OIF (other than model simulations, the only data presently available to assess this comes from the geological record, e.g. Vostok ice core record of dust supply and atmospheric CO2); and (2) the necessity of making realistic estimates of the cost of OIF (i.e. carbon sequestered per unit of iron added) to provide comparisons of the ratio of cost:environmental risk of OIF with other mitigation strategies.

TI  - Ironing out rising CO2
AB  - The reports, which track the effects of iron fertilization in the Southern Ocean, are discussed. According to the hypothesis, increasing iron concentrations triggers the growth of algal blooms which then sequester atmospheric CO2 for photosynthesis: more iron, less atmospheric CO2. To test the hypothesis, the Southern Ocean Iron Experiment added iron to areas of the Southern Ocean that support relatively low phytoplankton levels and set up projects to monitor biological activity and long-term carbon storage. It is found that iron fertilization triggered an increase in phytoplankton numbers and an increase in uptake of atmospheric CO2.

TI  - Physiological responses of coccolithophores to abrupt exposure of naturally low pH deep seawater
AB  - Upwelling is the process by which deep, cold, relatively high-CO2, nutrient-rich seawater rises to the sunlit surface of the ocean. This seasonal process has fueled geoengineering initiatives to fertilize the surface ocean with deep seawater to enhance productivity and thus promote the drawdown of CO2. Coccolithophores, which inhabit many upwelling regions naturally â€˜fertilizedâ€™ by deep seawater, have been investigated in the laboratory in the context of ocean acidification to determine the extent to which nutrients and CO2 impact their physiology, but few data exist in the field except from mesocosms. Here, we used the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (north Atlantic Ocean) Observatory to retrieve seawater from depths with elevated CO2 and nutrients, mimicking geoengineering approaches. We tested the effects of abrupt natural deep seawater fertilization on the physiology and biogeochemistry of two strains of Emiliania huxleyi of known physiology. None of the strains tested underwent cell divisions when incubated in waters obtained from &lt;1,000 m (pH = 7.99â€“8.08; CO2 = 373â€“485 p.p.m; 1.5â€“12 Î¼M nitrate). However, growth was promoted in both strains when cells were incubated in seawater from ~1,000 m (pH = 7.9; CO2 ~560 p.p.m.; 14â€“17 Î¼M nitrate) and ~4,800 m (pH = 7.9; CO2 ~600 p.p.m.; 21 Î¼M nitrate). Emiliania huxleyi strain CCMP 88E showed no differences in growth rate or in cellular content or production rates of particulate organic (POC) and inorganic (PIC) carbon and cellular particulate organic nitrogen (PON) between treatments using water from 1,000 m and 4,800 m. However, despite the N: P ratio of seawater being comparable in water from ~1,000 and ~4,800 m, the PON production rates were three times lower in one incubation using water from ~1,000 m compared to values observed in water from ~4,800 m. Thus, the POC:PON ratios were threefold higher in cells that were incubated in ~1,000 m seawater. The heavily calcified strain NZEH exhibited lower growth rates and PIC production rates when incubated in water from ~4,800 m compared to ~1,000 m, while cellular PIC, POC and PON were higher in water from 4,800 m. Calcite Sr/Ca ratios increased with depth despite constant seawater Sr/Ca, indicating that upwelling changes coccolith geochemistry. Our study provides the first experimental and field trial of a geoengineering approach to test how deep seawater impacts coccolithophore physiological and biogeochemical properties. Given that coccolithophore growth was only stimulated using waters obtained from &gt;1,000 m, artificial upwelling using shallower waters may not be a suitable approach for promoting carbon sequestration for some locations and assemblages, and should therefore be investigated on a site-by-site basis.

TI  - The role of diatom resting spores in pelagic-benthic coupling in the Southern Ocean
AB  - Natural iron fertilization downstream of Southern Ocean island plateaus supports large phytoplankton blooms and promotes carbon export from the mixed layer. In addition to sequestering atmospheric CO2, the biological carbon pump also supplies organic matter (OM) to deep-ocean ecosystems. Although the total flux of OM arriving at the seafloor sets the energy input to the system, the chemical nature of OM is also of significance. However, a quantitative framework linking ecological flux vectors to OM composition is currently lacking. In the present study we report the lipid composition of export fluxes collected by five moored sediment traps deployed in contrasting productivity regimes of Southern Ocean island systems (Kerguelen, Crozet and South Georgia) and compile them with quantitative data on diatom and faecal pellet fluxes. At the three naturally iron-fertilized sites, the relative contribution of labile lipids (mono-and polyunsaturated fatty acids, unsaturated fatty alcohols) is 2-4 times higher than at low productivity sites. There is a strong attenuation of labile components as a function of depth, irrespective of productivity. The three island systems also display regional characteristics in lipid export. An enrichment of zooplankton dietary sterols, such as C-27 Delta(5), at South Georgia is consistent with high zooplankton and krill biomass in the region and the importance of faecal pellets to particulate organic carbon (POC) flux. There is a strong association of diatom resting spore fluxes that dominate productive flux regimes with energy-rich unsaturated fatty acids. At the Kerguelen Plateau we provide a statistical framework to link seasonal variation in ecological flux vectors and lipid composition over a complete annual cycle. Our analyses demonstrate that ecological processes in the upper ocean, e.g. resting spore formation and grazing, not only impact the magnitude and stoichiometry of the Southern Ocean biological pump, but also regulate the composition of exported OM and the nature of pelagic-benthic coupling.

TI  - New Perspectives on the Marine Carbon Cycle-The Marine Dissolved Organic Matter Reactivity Continuum
AB  - This perspective challenges our current understanding of the marine carbon cycle, including an alternative explanation of bulk 14C-DOM measurements. We propose the adoption of the carbon reactivity continuum concept previously established for lakes and sediments for the oceans using kinetic data and term this the marine DOM reactivity continuum. We need to gain a fundamental understanding of the biogeochemical drivers of surface water DOM concentrations and reactivity, biological carbon pump efficiency, and the autotrophic communities that are the ultimate but variable sources of marine DOM. This perspective is intended to shift our focus to a more inclusive kinetic model and may lead us to a more accurate assessment of the active and dynamic role marine DOM plays in the global carbon cycle. Currently, the kinetic data to establish and validate such a marine DOM reactivity continuum model are still lacking, and their resolution depends on the discovery of new organic tracers that span large differences in reactivity and microbial degradation rates. We may need to refocus our efforts in deciphering the structure and reactivity of marine organic molecules in a kinetic context, including the microbial and physicochemical constraints on molecular reactivity that are present in the deep ocean.

TI  - DOE researches new approaches for carbon management
AB  - The DOE is seeking for new ways to manage and store carbon. In a report â€³Carbon Sequestration Research and Developmentâ€³, the DOE focused on sequestering carbon to reduce CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. Any viable system for sequestering carbon must be safe, environmentally benign, effective and economical, and must be acceptable to the public. Most carbon emissions are a result of the combustion of fossil fuels in the production of energy. The aim of the report was to develop a road map identifying R&amp;D that can lead to the use of carbon sequestration. The report that proposed a pure CO2 stream generated by a power plant, decarbonized fuel production system or industrial facility could be injected into the ocean directly; and the net oceanic uptake from the atmosphere could be enhanced through a method such as iron fertilization. The final option for sequestering is geologic formations. Active but uneconomical oil and gas reservoirs, aqueous formations, and deep and unminable coal formations are the three types of formations that have potential for successfully sequestering large amounts of CO2. Developing improved methods of separation, transport and storage will also facilitate the technology, allowing it to be a realistic approach to reduce and conserve CO2 emissions.

TI  - Model simulations of carbon sequestration in the northwest Pacific by patch fertilization
AB  - Iron fertilization of nutrient-rich surface waters of the ocean is one possible way to help slow the rising levels of atmospheric CO2 by sequestering it in the oceans via biological carbon export. Here, I use an ocean general circulation model to simulate a patch of nutrient depletion in the subpolar northwest Pacific under various scenarios. Model results confirm that surface fertilization is an inefficient way to sequester carbon from the atmosphere (Gnanadesikan et al., 2003), since only about 20% of the exported carbon comes initially from the atmosphere. Fertilization reduces future production and thus CO2 uptake by utilizing nutrients that would otherwise be available later. Effectively, this can be considered as leakage when compared to a control run. This "effective" leakage and the actual leakage of sequestered CO2 cause a significant, rapid decrease in carbon retention (only 30-45% retained after 10 years and less than 20% after 50 years). This contrasts markedly with the almost 100% retention efficiency for the same duration using the same model, when carbon is disposed directly into the northwest Pacific (Matsumoto and Mignone, 2005). As a consequence, the economic effectiveness of patch fertilization is poor in two limiting cases of the future price path of carbon. Sequestered carbon in patch fertilization is lost to the atmosphere at increasingly remote places as time passes, which would make monitoring exceedingly difficult. If all organic carbon from one-time fertilization reached the ocean bottom and remineralized there, acidification would be about -0.05 pH unit with O2 depletion about -20 Î¼ mol kg-1. These anomalies are probably too small to seriously threaten deep sea biota, but they are underestimated in the model because of its large grid size. The results from this study offer little to advocate purposeful surface fertilization as a serious means to address the anthropogenic carbon problem.

TI  - Carbon sequestering using remote sensing
AB  - Climate change is an environmental threat, and to keep global warming under 2 degrees C, actions are needed to prevent escalating negative effects like droughts and flooding. Cutting emissions might not suffice, and other methods might be needed. One suggested method is Oceanic Iron Fertilization (OIF), where oceans are fertilized with iron to increase primary production and sequestration of CO2 from atmosphere. OIF has been criticized as risky due to unknown side-effects. Fertilization research was explored in-depth to identify risks and opportunities, and how it could be assisted by remote sensing. The Southern Ocean has been a focus of research for OIF. This region is productive, but limited by the short growth season and lack of iron. One factor in this Southern Ocean region is whale numbers. Whales are effective fertilizers, diving deep to hunt and bringing important nutrients to the surface. Whales have been focused on this paper, as OIF within their natural habitat could resemble natural fertilization. Locating whales can be done with remote sensing. Satellites can also play a role in iron fertilization by tracking resulting algal blooms. The Southern Ocean has highest potential for OIF, and the option should be explored with remote sensing and whale knowledge.

TI  - The Enhancement of Marine Productivity for Climate Stabilization and Food Security
AB  - Ocean fertilization offers the prospect of addressing two of the current pressing problems facing the global community. Macronutrient addition to 70% of the surface ocean where it is found in limiting concentrations is expected to stimulate the ocean biological carbon pump. Technological intervention can simultaneously sequester carbon from the atmosphere and increase the sustainable supply of marine protein. A summary is provided of the major issues surrounding the technology including: potential benefits, implementation, environmental risk, cost, and societal values. The alternative idea of providing the micronutrient iron is considered and found to have disadvantages. Carbon credits could fund the implementation of fertilization while providing increased fish stocks to contribute food security for the rising population. This collateral benefit could be directed to provide economical protein for the world's malnourished poor. The risks need to be compared to the costs of not acting to mitigate climate change, and the environmental risk of increasing food production on the land to cope with a rising global population.

TI  - The Cost of Reducing the North Atlantic Ocean Biological Carbon Pump
AB  - To predict the impacts of climate change it is essential to understand how anthropogenic change alters the balance between atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial reservoirs of carbon. It has been estimated that natural atmospheric concentrations of CO2 are almost 200 ppm lower than they would be without the transport of organic material produced in the surface ocean to depth, an ecosystem service driven by mechanisms collectively referred to as the biological carbon pump. Here we quantify potential reductions in carbon sequestration fluxes in the North Atlantic Ocean through the biological carbon pump over the twenty-first century, using two independent biogeochemical models, driven by low and high IPCC AR5 carbon emission scenarios. The carbon flux at 1000m (the depth at which it is assumed that carbon is sequestered) in the North Atlantic was estimated to decline between 27 and 43\% by the end of the century, depending on the biogeochemical model and the emission scenario considered. In monetary terms, the value of this loss in carbon sequestration service in the North Atlantic was estimated to range between US\$170-US\$3000 billion in abatement (mitigation) costs and US\$23-US\$401 billion in social (adaptation) costs, over the twenty-first century. Our results challenge the frequent assumption that coastal habitats store more significant amounts of carbon and are under greater threat. We highlight the largely unrecognized economic importance of the natural, blue carbon sequestration service provided by the open ocean, which is predicted to undergo significant anthropogenic-driven change.

TI  - A sea trial of enhancing carbon removal from Chinese coastal waters by stimulating seaweed cultivation through artificial upwelling
AB  - The potential of artificial upwelling (AU) in enhancing transport of nutrient-rich bottom water to the surface, stimulating seaweed growth and consequently increasing organic carbon removal from coastal waters to land after harvest has attracted increasing scientific interest. This practice, however, hardly have field experiments to confirm the hypothesis. The coastal mariculture environment requires rigid AU system that not only can withstand rough weather conditions but also be effective in fertilizing the surface ocean. In this paper, a new solar-powered, air-lifted AU system was applied to study the potential effect on regional carbon removal. Experiments were conducted in the oligotrophic Aoshan Bay, Shandong Province, China. Comparison of the temperature and nutrient column between AU influenced site and the reference site suggests that the nutrient-rich bottom water has been successfully lifted to the surface. The results show that the growth of seaweeds was effectively stimulated by AU. The average weight of a single plant has increased by 8.98g, and consequently an extra carbon removal potential of 14.8 thousand tons in Chinese coastal waters could be expected if the system can be applied along the Chinese coastal waters.

TI  - Climate change, ocean processes and ocean iron fertilization
AB  - Observations indicate that the rate of increase in concentration of atmospheric CO2 is increasing faster than projected in any of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission scenarios. Several mitigation measures, referred to as `geoengineering options', have been proposed to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. To be successful, such a mitigation operation must remove `significant' CO2 from the atmosphere for many decades, be verifiable, and not cause deleterious side effects. One option, purposeful addition of iron to fertilize photosynthetic uptake Of CO2 by phytoplankton in regions of the ocean where iron is a limiting nutrient, has received considerable scientific attention. In the last 15 yr, a dozen small-scale open ocean iron fertilization experiments have been performed and a succession of models of large-scale fertilization have been developed. As successive models have become more realistic, the amounts Of CO2 forecast to be sequestered have dropped, and in all cases are small relative to the amounts Of CO2 projected to be released through fossil fuel burning over the next century for any of the IPCC emission scenarios. Possible side effects include a long term reduction in ocean productivity, alteration of the structure of marine food webs, and a more rapid increase in ocean acidity. Most importantly, increased remineralization associated with the increased downward export of organic carbon particles would result: in increased production of the third most important long-lived greenhouse gas, N2O. The magnitude of this effect is poorly known.

TI  - Sequestration of atmospheric CO2 in global carbon pools
AB  - Sequestering atmospheric CO2 is necessitated by its present concentration of 385 ppm and increasing at the rate of 2 ppm y-1. Increase in atmospheric emission of CO2 with the attendant global warming and environmental degradation are driven by global energy demand. In comparison with the emission of 300 Pg C between 1850 and 2000, total emission during the 21st century is estimated at 950 to 2195 Pg, with an annual rate of emission of 20 to 35 Pg C y-1. Reduction of CO 2 atmospheric loading can be achieved by biological, chemical and technological options through either reducing or sequestering emissions. This article describes technological options of sequestering atmospheric CO 2 into other global pools. Geologic sequestration involves underground storage of industrially emitted CO2 into the geosphere for long-term and secure storage. Liquefied CO2 is injected about 1000 m below the ground surface either in stable porous rocks, oil wells, coal beds, or saline aquifers. Co-injecting CO2 along with H2S and SO2 is also possible. Over time, the trapped CO2 reacts with minerals to form carbonates, enhances oil recovery, or displaces coal bed methane. Deep injection of CO2 under the ocean creates a CO2 lake which eventually penetrates into the sediments. Iron fertilization is another technique of enhancing the C pool in marine biota, notably phytoplankton. The so-called "biological pumping" is based on the "iron hypothesis" of transferring C to the ocean floor. Terrestrial C sequestration is based on the natural process of photosynthesis. Transfer of CO2 into the biotic pool and soil C pool via humification and formation of secondary carbonates has numerous ancillary benefits through enhancement of ecosystem services. Soil C sequestration is essential to improving soil quality, increasing use efficiency of agronomic input, and advancing world food security. It is also needed to improve water quality by filtration and denaturing of pollutants, and enhancing biodiversity by saving land for nature conservancy. Soil C sequestration is a low hanging fruit, and a bridge to the future until low-C or no-C fuel sources take effect. Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2008.

TI  - Recovery of carbon benefits by overharvested baleen whale populations is threatened by climate change
AB  - Despite the importance of marine megafauna on ecosystem functioning, their contribution to the oceanic carbon cycle is still poorly known. Here, we explored the role of baleen whales in the biological carbon pump across the southern hemisphere based on the historical and forecasted abundance of five baleen whale species. We modelled whale-mediated carbon sequestration through the sinking of their carcasses after natural death. We provide the first temporal dynamics of this carbon pump from 1890 to 2100, considering both the effects of exploitation and climate change on whale populations. We reveal that at their pre-exploitation abundance, the five species of southern whales could sequester 4.0 Ã— 10 5 tonnes of carbon per year (tC yr -1). This estimate dropped to 0.6 Ã— 10 5 tC yr -1 by 1972 following commercial whaling. However, with the projected restoration of whale populations under a RCP8.5 climate scenario, the sequestration would reach 1.7 Ã— 10 5 tC yr -1 by 2100, while without climate change, recovered whale populations could sequester nearly twice as much (3.2 Ã— 10 5 tC yr -1) by 2100. This highlights the persistence of whaling damages on whale populations and associated services as well as the predicted harmful impacts of climate change on whale ecosystem services.

TI  - Methods for greenhouse gas offset accounting: A case study of ocean iron fertilization
AB  - Reducing atmospheric carbon concentration by removing past emissions can extend our rapidly diminishing emission budgets corresponding to the target of limiting the temperature increase to 2 Â°C above preindustrial levels. Forestation measures to offset carbon emissions have already entered the Kyoto Protocol. Other carbon offset options like ocean iron fertilization or chemically enhanced weathering are currently being analyzed. The analysis and comparison of such options requires determination of the amount of carbon credits generated that can be used for compliance. In our analysis we assess the impact of various accounting methods applied to large-scale sink enhancement projects, taking into account the partly temporary storage characteristics arising from such projects. We apply the various accounting methods to hypothetical large-scale Southern Ocean iron fertilization projects for different durations. From an economic perspective, issuing temporary carbon credits would provide the largest number of carbon credits at an early stage. This is equivalent to the existing tCER regulation under the Kyoto Protocol. Issuing temporary carbon credits for short-term ocean iron fertilization would also benefit the environment, as all credits would have to be replaced in the next commitment period. As some carbon will be stored permanently, this reduces atmospheric carbon concentration. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - THE USE OF IRON AND OTHER TRACE-ELEMENT FERTILIZERS IN MITIGATING GLOBAL WARMING
AB  - If current trends continue, before the end of the next century atmospheric CO2 levels will be about double those of a century ago. Other greenhouse gases, including methane and chlorofluorocarbons, also are increasing at similar or even higher rates. The effects of such global atmospheric changes on climate, and, thus, on agriculture, forestry and natural ecosystems, are uncertain. Only the results of the planetary ``experiment{''} itself will provide a definitive answer. Current projections range from catastrophic to favorable. Prudence suggests that steps be taken to slow down these rapid atmospheric changes, even in the absence of a definitive estimate of risks. Natural sinks for CO2 already account for the disappearance of as much as 60\% of anthropogenic CO2 production due to fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and soil organic carbon oxidation. Thus, current rates of increases in atmospheric CO2, about 0.4\% per year, could be cut in half by reducing anthropogenic CO2 outputs by 20\%, or increasing sinks by a similar amount. Such a reduction would significantly reduce the risks of major climatic changes. Programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are being instituted in Japan and Europe, but not in the U.S. or most other countries. Reduction of CO2 buildup must focus on the reduction of the major sources - fossil fuel usage, deforestation, soil carbon oxidation - and on increasing sinks. The only practical methods for increasing CO2 sinks are based on photosynthesis, primarily through increased C storage in standing tree biomass, the use biomass as substitutes for fossil fuels, and, possibly, through the stimulation of ocean primary productivity by iron fertilization. Fertilizing forests and oceans with iron and other trace elements to increase primary productivity and CO2 sequestration is an attractive concept. Application of small quantities of trace elements, could, in principle, result in the sequestration of many tons of CO2. Iron limits primary productivity in some ocean areas. How to practically fertilize the oceans with iron, the environmental impacts of such additions, and their effectiveness in reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations are controversial issues. Long-term studies of ocean fertilization will be required, and such schemes can not be included in current global warming mitigation options. Iron and other trace elements are often limiting factors in agriculture, and many reports exist of such limitations in managed forestry. However, it is presently unclear how widespread such deficiencies are in managed forests, and global effects on CO2 balances can not be projected. Fertilization with major nutrients - P, K, and N - is often effective in stimulating forest productivity and could be an economical approach to large-scale CO2 sequestration. Increased forest fertilization with major nutrients will, in many cases, also require applications of some trace elements. In conclusion, forest fertilization with trace elements and even major nutrients could be an affordable and near-term method of reducing future global warming.

TI  - Impacts of nitrogen limitation on the sinking rate of the coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi (Prymnesiophyceae)
AB  - The biological carbon pump in the ocean plays an important role in controlling atmospheric CO2 levels. Approximately 1\% of the yearly 50-60 Pg C of marine primary production settles in the deep ocean, where it is effectively sequestered for centuries to millennia. Central to the strength of the pump is the sinking velocity of phytoplankton cells and other organic debris. Stokes' Law indicates that the sinking velocity of a spherical cell will depend on its size and density, where larger, heavier cells will sink at a faster rate. Given that growth conditions can result in changes in cell size and macromolecular composition of phytoplankton, it might be expected that such changes could cause alterations in sinking velocity and carbon drawdown via the biological carbon pump. In the future, phytoplankton cells in the open ocean are predicted to be more subject to nutrient limitation. In this study we examined the effects of nitrogen limitation on the sinking velocity of Emiliania huxleyi, a coccolithophore responsible for significant phytoplankton blooms and biological drawdown of carbon. Nitrogen limitation caused changes in macromolecular composition, especially lipid content and coccosphere thickness. However, the overall density of the cells remained similar, and, as a consequence, cell size was the major determinant of sinking rate with N-limited cells in exponential phase sinking more slowly than N-replete cells. Cells in stationary phase showed the reverse trend with N-limited cells sinking faster, although not as fast as N-replete cells in exponential phase. N-limited cells produced more transparent exopolymers, suggesting an increased capacity for marine snow formation. These observations have implications for the efficiency of the biological carbon pump in areas that have increased nutrient stress caused by global climate change.

TI  - Side effects and accounting aspects of hypothetical large-scale Southern Ocean iron fertilization
AB  - Recent suggestions to slow down the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide have included ocean fertilization by addition of the micronutrient iron to Southern Ocean surface waters, where a number of natural and artificial iron fertilization experiments have shown that low ambient iron concentrations limit phytoplankton growth. Using a coupled carbon-climate model with the marine biology's response to iron addition calibrated against data from natural iron fertilization experiments, we examine biogeochemical side effects of a hypothetical large-scale Southern Ocean Iron Fertilization (OIF) that need to be considered when attempting to account for possible OIF-induced carbon offsets. In agreement with earlier studies our model simulates an OIF-induced increase in local air-sea CO2 fluxes by about 73 GtC over a 100-year period, which amounts to about 48\% of the OIF-induced increase in organic carbon export out of the fertilized area. Offsetting CO2 return fluxes outside the region and after stopping the fertilization at 1, 7, 10, 50, and 100 years are quantified for a typical accounting period of 100 years. For continuous Southern Ocean iron fertilization, the CO2 return flux outside the fertilized area cancels about 20\% of the fertilization-induced CO2 air-sea flux within the fertilized area on a 100-yr timescale. This ``leakage{''} effect has a radiative impact more than twice as large as the simulated enhancement of marine N2O emissions. Other side effects not yet discussed in terms of accounting schemes include a decrease in Southern Ocean oxygen levels and a simultaneous shrinking of tropical suboxic areas, and accelerated ocean acidification in the entire water column in the Southern Ocean at the expense of reduced globally-averaged surface-water acidification. A prudent approach to account for the OIF-induced carbon sequestration would account for global air-sea CO2 fluxes rather than for local fluxes into the fertilized area only. However, according to our model, this would underestimate the potential for offsetting CO2 emissions by about 20\% on a 100 year accounting timescale. We suggest that a fair accounting scheme applicable to both terrestrial and marine carbon sequestration has to be based on emission offsets rather than on changes in individual carbon pools.

TI  - Satellite-Based Estimation of Particulate Organic Carbon Export in the Northern South China Sea
AB  - Knowledge of particulate organic carbon export flux (EP) is the key to understanding the marine biological carbon pump. In this study, a satellite remote sensing algorithm based on the food-web model established by Siegel et al. (2014; ) was used to estimate EP in the northern South China Sea (NSCS), which consists of direct sinking flux of large phytoplankton and associated aggregates by gravity and flux of zooplankton feces by grazing. This is the first time that fine spatiotemporal variation of satellite-derived EP in the NSCS is unveiled. Compared with the results on 1 degrees spatial scale products, the model results based on the satellite products with 1/3 degrees and 1/12 degrees resolutions showed better consistency with the observations. Validation with in situ EP showed that the model exhibited a good performance in the NSCS basin, but the predicted EP in the shelf regions were smaller compared with measurements. The satellite-derived annual-mean EP in the shelf areas was 8.47 and 5.56mmol C m (-2) d (-1) in the NSCS basin, on the 1/3 degrees spatial scale, with relative differences from observations were about -50\% and -15\% for the shelf and basin, respectively. The flux of feces from zooplankton grazing, especially that from microzooplankton grazing, might account for the major fraction of the EP in the NSCS. Accurate products of ocean net primary production and empirical coefficients in the food web (e.g., export efficiency of zooplankton grazing and specific mortality rate of nongrazing phytoplankton) suitable for the NSCS, are essential for performance improvement of the satellite-based EP model. Plain Language Summary The ocean has the largest inventory of active cycling carbon in the Earth's system. At present, the global ocean absorbs about 2 billion tons of CO2 from the atmosphere every year, accounting for about one fourth of the world's annual CO2 emissions. By converting inorganic carbon into organic carbon and exporting particulate organic carbon to the deep ocean, where it can be sequestered on time scales ranging from seasons to centuries, the biological carbon pump is essential for carbon sequestration in the ocean. However, the regulatory mechanism of the biological carbon pump is complex, and remains poorly understood, especially in the marginal seas. In this study, a food-web model established by Siegel et al. (2014; ) was used to estimate the particulate organic carbon export flux in the northern South China Sea. This is the first time the fine spatiotemporal variation of satellite-derived POC export flux in the northern South China Sea is unveiled. In addition, based on the model results, we found that the flux of feces from microzooplankton grazing plays an important role in regulating the particulate organic carbon export in the northern South China Sea.

TI  - Global evaluation of particulate organic carbon flux parameterizations and implications for atmospheric pCO2
AB  - The shunt of photosynthetically derived particulate organic carbon (POC) from the euphotic zone and deep remineralization comprises the basic mechanism of the â€œbiological carbon pump.â€ POC raining through the â€œtwilight zoneâ€ (euphotic depth to 1Â km) and â€œmidnight zoneâ€ (1Â km to 4Â km) is remineralized back to inorganic form through respiration. Accurately modeling POC flux is critical for understanding the â€œbiological pumpâ€ and its impacts on air-sea CO2 exchange and, ultimately, long-term ocean carbon sequestration. Yet commonly used parameterizations have not been tested quantitatively against global data sets using identical modeling frameworks. Here we use a single one-dimensional physical-biogeochemical modeling framework to assess three common POC flux parameterizations in capturing POC flux observations from moored sediment traps and thorium-234 depletion. The exponential decay, Martin curve, and ballast model are compared to data from 11 biogeochemical provinces distributed across the globe. In each province, the model captures satellite-based estimates of surface primary production within uncertainties. Goodness of fit is measured by how well the simulation captures the observations, quantified by bias and the root-mean-square error and displayed using â€œtarget diagrams.â€ Comparisons are presented separately for the twilight zone and midnight zone. We find that the ballast hypothesis shows no improvement over a globally or regionally parameterized Martin curve. For all provinces taken together, Martin's b that best fits the data is [0.70, 0.98]; this finding reduces by at least a factor of 3 previous estimates of potential impacts on atmospheric pCO2 of uncertainty in POC export to a more modest range [âˆ’16Â ppm, +12Â ppm].

TI  - The Fate of Carbon and Nutrients Exported Out of the Southern Ocean
AB  - Southern Ocean (SO) nutrient export via mode and intermediate waters is known to affect global biological production. The accompanying effects on the CO2 flux outside the SO are less certain. We performed idealized model simulations to separate the transient effects of SO carbon pumps on nutrients, primary production, and CO2 flux outside the SO. The SO biological carbon pump leads to dissolved inorganic carbon and nutrient reduction at the surface and in the exported water masses, and to a dissolved inorganic carbon increase at depth through the sinking of organic matter. When primary production is suppressed in the SO, only 30\% of SO export, 43\% of SO net primary production, and 50\% of biologically driven SO CO2 flux are compensated outside the SO on a 200-year time scale. In contrast, when the abiotically driven CO2 flux is suppressed, 90\% of CO2 outgassing in the SO is compensated by air-sea CO2 exchange outside the SO. The longer sequestration time scale of the biological carbon pump can be explained by incomplete compensation of primary production. This is a result of almost complete compensation of diatom productivity and no compensation of nanophytoplankton productivity due to feedbacks in phytoplankton community composition. The longer sequestration time scale is further sustained by the sinking and remineralization of particles in the deep ocean that are not in contact with the atmosphere over the 200-year time scale considered. As SO biologically driven CO2 flux is only partly compensated outside the SO, potential future changes in SO productivity may have an important impact on the global carbon cycle.

TI  - Bicarbonate uptake by Southern Ocean phytoplankton
AB  - Marine phytoplankton have the potential to significantly buffer future increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. However, in order for CO2 fertilization to have an effect on carbon sequestration to the deep ocean, the increase in dissolved CO2 must stimulate primary productivity; that is, marine phototrophs must be CO2 limited [}Riebesell et al., 1993]. Estimation of the extent of bicarbonate (HCO3-) uptake in the oceans is therefore required to determine whether the anthropogenic carbon sources will enhance carbon flux to the deep ocean. Using short-term (CO2)-C-14-disequilibrium experiments during the Southern Ocean Iron Experiment (SOFeX), we show that HCO3- uptake by Southern Ocean phytoplankton is significant. Since the majority of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the ocean is in the form of bicarbonate, the biological pump may therefore be insensitive to anthropogenic CO2. Approximately half of the DIC uptake observed was attributable to direct HCO3- uptake, the other half being direct CO2 uptake mediated either by passive diffusion or active uptake mechanisms. The increase in growth rates and decrease in CO2 concentration associated with the iron fertilization did not trigger any noticeable changes in the mode of DIC acquisition, indicating that under most environmental conditions the carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) is constitutive. A low-CO2 treatment induced an increase in uptake of CO2, which we attributed to increased extracellular carbonic anhydrase activity, at the expense of direct HCO3- transport across the plasmalemma. Isotopic disequilibrium experimental results are consistent with Southern Ocean carbon stable isotope fractionation data from this and other studies. Although iron fertilization has been shown to significantly enhance phytoplankton growth and may potentially increase carbon flux to the deep ocean, an important source of the inorganic carbon taken up by phytoplankton in this study was HCO3-, whose concentration is negligibly affected by the anthropogenic rise in CO2. We conclude that biological productivity in this region of the world's ocean is unlikely to be directly regulated by natural or anthropogenic variations in atmospheric CO2 concentrations because of the presence of a constitutive CCM.

TI  - Carbon export by small particles in the Norwegian Sea
AB  - Despite its fundamental role in controlling the Earth's climate, present estimates of global organic carbon export to the deep sea are affected by relatively large uncertainties. These uncertainties are due to lack of observations as well as disagreement among methods and assumptions used to estimate carbon export. Complementary observations are thus needed to reduce these uncertainties. Here we show that optical backscattering measured by Bio-Argo floats can detect a seasonal carbon export flux in the Norwegian Sea. This export was most likely due to small particles (i.e., 0.2-20 Î¼m), was comparable to published export values, and contributed to long-term carbon sequestration. Our findings highlight the importance of small particles and of physical mixing in the biological carbon pump and support the use of autonomous platforms as tools to improve our mechanistic understanding of the ocean carbon cycle. Key Points Bio-Argo floats can track small particles in the mesopelagic region Export fluxes from small particles were significant Small particles contributed to long-term carbon sequestration Â©2014.

TI  - Could fertilizing the oceans fix climate change?

TI  - Continuous Supply of Bioavailable Iron for Marine Diatoms from Steelmaking Slag
AB  - The bioavailability and durability of Fe released from decarburization steelmaking slag was examined for two marine diatom species. The bioavailability of Fe released from the slag was compared with that from the reagent FeCl3 center dot 6H(2)O in the presence or absence of the synthetic chelator ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, which affects Fe speciation in seawater. The duration of bioavailability was determined by the recovery of the growth rate on intermittent additions of macro-nutrients other than Fe. Abiotic reduction of bioavailable Fe from the slag in seawater was also investigated for 5 or 15 d. Thus, the bioavailability of Fe released from the slag was observed to be sufficiently high to promote the maximum growth rate; this was similar to that observed with the reagent inorganic Fe. This implies that the iron released from the slag is a dissolved ferric and/or ferrous ion/hydroxide species. In the culture media, to which the slag was added at the concentration of 20 mg L-1, the slag supplied bioavailable Fe to two diatoms for 50 d. The probable duration for which the slag was available as an Fe source was approximately 10 times longer than the reported duration in in situ iron fertilization experiments. These results indicate that continuous Fe fertilization can be achieved by a single addition of the slag, and hence, we can reduce the energy and cost of ocean fertilization and also create a resource of microalgae biofuels.

TI  - Efficiency of small scale carbon mitigation by patch iron fertilization
AB  - While nutrient depletion scenarios have long shown that the high-latitude High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll (HNLC) regions are the most effective for sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide, recent simulations with prognostic biogeochemical models have suggested that only a fraction of the potential drawdown can be realized. We use a global ocean biogeochemical general circulation model developed at GFDL and Princeton to examine this and related issues. We fertilize two patches in the North and Equatorial Pacific, and two additional patches in the Southern Ocean HNLC region north of the biogeochemical divide and in the Ross Sea south of the biogeochemical divide. We evaluate the simulations using observations from both artificial and natural iron fertilization experiments at nearby locations. We obtain by far the greatest response to iron fertilization at the Ross Sea site, where sea ice prevents escape of sequestered CO2 during the wintertime, and the CO2 removed from the surface ocean by the biological pump is carried into the deep ocean by the circulation. As a consequence, CO2 remains sequestered on century time-scales and the efficiency of fertilization remains almost constant no matter how frequently iron is applied as long as it is confined to the growing season. The second most efficient site is in the Southern Ocean. The North Pacific site has lower initial nutrients and thus a lower efficiency. Fertilization of the Equatorial Pacific leads to an expansion of the suboxic zone and a striking increase in denitrification that causes a sharp reduction in overall surface biological export production and CO2 uptake. The impacts on the oxygen distribution and surface biological export are less prominent at other sites, but nevertheless still a source of concern. The century time scale retention of iron in this model greatly increases the long-term biological response to iron addition as compared with simulations in which the added iron is rapidly scavenged from the ocean.

TI  - The Effects of Iron Fertilization on Carbon Sequestration in the Southern Ocean
AB  - An unresolved issue in ocean and climate sciences is whether changes to the surface ocean input of the micronutrient iron can alter the flux of carbon to the deep ocean. During the Southern Ocean Iron Experiment we measured an increase in the flux of particulate carbon from the surface mixed layer, as well as changes in particle cycling below the iron-fertilized patch. The flux of carbon was similar in magnitude to that of natural blooms in the Southern Ocean and thus small relative to global carbon budgets and proposed geoengineering plans to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide in the deep sea.

TI  - CO2 sequestration: Processes and methodologies
AB  - Rapidly growing economy and its consequence of relying heavily on the fossil fuels, for power generation, accounts for the major CO2 pollutant in the atmosphere. Natural carbon cycle process will not be effective in reducing the pollutant content, as the amount and rate of CO2 dissipation raise at a drastic rate. This alarming situation urgently requires technologies for carbon dioxide capture and sequestering (CCS). With the development of technologies every day, the amount of CO2 emission is expected to increase steeply, which necessitates more technologies to sequester CO2 with a target of 50 ppm by 2050. CCS involves the capture of gas at some stage of the industrial process followed by pressurization and transporting it to stable geological sites like saline aquifers, depleted oil and gas fields, deep coal seams where it can be trapped for thousands of years. CO2 sequestration requires multiple fundamental R&amp;D approaches and significant breakthroughs. The purpose of this review is to have an integrated analysis of the carbon sequestration process including the state of the art technologies for CO2 capture, separation, transport, storage, leakage, monitoring, and life cycle analysis. Depending on the source of emission, different techniques and methodologies adopted by the scientific community were analyzed and discussed. A brief description of the best practices and techniques for CO2 capturing like absorption, adsorption, cryogenic, and membranes will be reviewed. A comparative study on the same will be analyzed based on their performance, efficiency, regeneration, adsorption rate, the volume of adsorption, cost, and energy required for regeneration. Some of the prerequisites for sequestering the captured carbon dioxide are safety, environmentally benign, effective, economical, and acceptable to the public. Natural sequestration methods include plantation, soil carbon sequestration, and CH4-CO2 reforming. Industrially acceptable sequestration process involves isolating the captured gas into places which are nonaccessible to living creatures which include basically geologic, oceanic, and terrestrial dumping sites. All the three geoengineering techniques and their subdivisions will be discussed in detail with up to date improvisations and results. Moreover, the concerns related to potential leakages while transporting supercritical CO2, uncertainty in terms of quantification of storage potential, accompanied by monitoring and engineering challenges have to be given prior attention in developing any sequestration process, which this review will give an overall picture and suggestions.

TI  - The Ultimate Ocean Ranch
AB  - Significant expansion of global food supply will require new advancements of similar impact to the Green Revolution. The Ultimate Ocean Ranch envisions enhancement of open-sea biological productivity through artificial upwelling of deep-ocean nutrients by means of ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC); food products will be derived by management of integrated ``floating grazing platforms,{''} which could also enhance atmospheric carbon dioxide sequestration and net oxygen production in the photic zone. Some of the required technologies exist; some must be developed. Commercialization of the concept will be required; this in turn will require the fullest possible integration of value-generating activities. We estimate, from typical ecological parameters and from some assumptions that can only be evaluated through research, that about \$ 3.3 M in aquatic food products could be produced annually from the water-pumping capability of a hypothetical 10-MW OTEC plant. This is not a large return on investment, but it precedes research and engineering development; other values will be generated. The urgency of the food problem and the lack of nullifying obstacles indicates further evaluation of this concept.

TI  - Effects of CO2 enrichment on marine phytoplankton
AB  - Rising atmospheric CO2 and deliberate CO2 sequestration in the ocean change seawater carbonate chemistry in a similar way, lowering seawater pH, carbonate ion concentration and carbonate saturation state and increasing dissolved CO2 concentration. These changes affect marine plankton in various ways. On the organismal level, a moderate increase in CO2 facilitates photosynthetic carbon fixation of some phytoplankton groups. It also enhances the release of dissolved carbohydrates, most notably during the decline of nutrient-limited phytoplankton blooms. A decrease in the carbonate saturation state represses biogenic calcification of the predominant marine calcifying organisms, foraminifera and coccolithophorids. On the ecosystem level these responses influence phytoplankton species composition and succession, favouring algal species which predominantly rely on CO2 utilization. Increased phytoplankton exudation promotes particle aggregation and marine snow formation, enhancing the vertical flux of biogenic material. A decrease in calcification may affect the competitive advantage of calcifying organisms, with possible impacts on their distribution and abundance. On the biogeochemical level, biological responses to CO2 enrichment and the related changes in carbonate chemistry can strongly alter the cycling of carbon and other bio-active elements in the ocean. Both decreasing calcification and enhanced carbon overproduction due to release of extracellular carbohydrates have the potential to increase the CO2 storage capacity of the ocean. Although the significance of such biological responses to CO2 enrichment becomes increasingly evident, our ability to make reliable predictions of their future developments and to quantify their potential ecological and biogeochemical impacts is still in its infancy.

TI  - A bibliometric analysis of climate engineering research
AB  - The past five years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of media and scientific publications on the topic of climate engineering, or geoengineering, and some scientists are increasingly calling for more research on climate engineering as a possible supplement to climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. In this context, understanding the current state of climate engineering research can help inform policy discussions and guide future research directions. Bibliometric analysis-the quantitative analysis of publications-is particularly applicable to fields with large bodies of literature that are difficult to summarize by traditional review methods. The multidisciplinary nature of the published literature on climate engineering makes it an ideal candidate for bibliometric analysis. Publications on climate engineering are found to be relatively recent (more than half of all articles during 1988-2011 were published since 2008), include a higher than average percentage of nonresearch articles (30% compared with 8-15% in related scientific disciplines), and be predominately produced by countries located in the Northern Hemisphere and speaking English. The majority of this literature focuses on land-based methods of carbon sequestration, ocean iron fertilization, and solar radiation management and is produced with little collaboration among research groups. This study provides a summary of existing publications on climate engineering, a perspective on the scientific underpinnings of the global dialogue on climate engineering, and a baseline for quantitatively monitoring the development of climate engineering research in the future.

TI  - Air-sea disequilibrium of carbon dioxide enhances the biological carbon sequestration in the Southern Ocean
AB  - Sinking and subduction of organic material removes carbon from the surface ocean and stores it in inorganic form after remineralization. The wind-driven upwelling of deep waters, notably in the Southern Ocean, counteracts the biological carbon sequestration by returning excess carbon from the abyss, potentially releasing it back to the atmosphere. Numerical models have shown that significant fraction of the excess carbon in the Antarctic Surface Water is not degassed to the atmosphere but reenters into the deep ocean due to the incomplete air-sea equilibration, effectively increasing the efficiency of biological carbon storage in the deep ocean. We develop a simple theory to consider the controls on this effect. The theory predicts a strong coupling between biological carbon sequestration and air-sea disequilibrium expressed as a linear relationship between the biological carbon pump and the degree of supersaturation in the deep ocean. Sensitivity experiments with a three-dimensional ocean biogeochemistry model support this prediction and demonstrate that the disequilibrium pump almost doubles the efficiency of biological carbon sequestration, relative to the effect of nutrient utilization.

TI  - Export is not enough: nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration
AB  - The question of whether ocean iron fertilization (OIF) can yield verifiable carbon sequestration is often cast in terms of whether fertilization results in enhanced particle export, However, model studies show that oceanic carbon storage is only weakly related to global particle export-depending instead on an increase in the carbon associated with the pool of remineralized nutrients. The magnitude of such an increase depends on circulation, stoichiometric ratios and gas exchange. We argue that this puts serious challenges before efforts to properly credit OIF that must be taken into account at the design stage.

TI  - Chemoattraction to dimethyl sulfide links the sulfur, iron, and carbon cycles in high-latitude oceans
AB  - Large marine regions, including the exceptionally productive Southern Ocean, are iron-limited. As a result, there has been substantial interest in iron-fertilizing high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) areas in an effort to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide. More recently, research has shifted to quantifying the beneficial effects of iron recycling by marine biota. Marine top predators such as whales and seabirds have been examined specifically in this regard as they have high biomass, form dense aggregations, and excrete bioavailable iron in concentrations seven orders of magnitude higher than ambient seawater. Despite it being well established that marine fauna link the iron and carbon cycles, the connection of this process to the sulfur cycle has rarely been considered. The chemoattraction of specific marine fauna to algal-derived dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is key in triggering dense, multi-species foraging aggregations that induce iron recycling, augmenting carbon assimilation. The goal of this paper is twofold; first, to highlight DMS chemoattraction as a behavior that catalyzes carbon sequestration via natural iron fertilization, and second, to identify knowledge gaps that recent biogeochemical advances can address. Fostering this interdisciplinary research will enhance our understanding of global climate regulation, ecosystem services provided by marine top predators, and the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, iron, and sulfur in HNLC waters.

TI  - Ocean uptake of carbon dioxide
AB  - Factors controlling the capacity of the ocean for taking up anthropogenic CO2 include carbon chemistry, distribution of alkalinity, pCO2 and total concentration of dissolved CO2, sea-air pCO2 difference, gas exchange rate across the sea-air interface, biological carbon pump, ocean water circulation and mixing, and dissolution of carbonate in deep sea sediments. A general review of these processes is given and models of ocean-atmosphere system based on our understanding of these regulating processes are used to estimate the magnitude of CO2 uptake by the ocean. We conclude that the ocean can absorb up to 35% of the fossil fuel emission. Direct measurements show that 55% of CO2 from fossil fuel burning remains in the atmosphere. The remaining 10% is not accounted for by atmospheric increases and ocean uptake. In addition, it is estimated that an amount equivalent to 30% of recent annual fossil fuel emissions is released into the atmosphere as a result of deforestation and farming. To balance global carbon budget, a sizable carbon sink besides the ocean is needed. Storage of carbon in terrestrial biosphere as a result of CO2 fertilization is a potential candidate for such missing carbon sinks.

TI  - Global patterns in efficiency of particulate organic carbon export and transfer to the deep ocean
AB  - The ocean's biological carbon pump is a key component of the global carbon cycle. Only a small fraction of the carbon fixed by primary production is exported to the deep ocean, yet this flux sets to first order the efficiency with which carbon is sequestered out of further contact with the atmosphere on long time scales. Here we examine global patterns in particle export efficiency (PEeff), the proportion of primary production that is exported from the surface ocean, and transfer efficiency (Teff), the fraction of exported organic matter that reaches the deep ocean. Previous studies have found a positive correlation between Teff and deep ocean calcite fluxes recovered from sediment traps, implying that ballasting by calcium carbonate may play an important role in regulating Teff. An alternative explanation is that this correlation is not causative, as regions where the dominant biomineral phase is calcite tend to be subtropical systems, which are hypothesized to produce sinking aggregates highly resistant to degradation. We attempt to distinguish between these alternative hypotheses on the control of Teff by examining the relationship between Teff and biomineral phases exported from the upper ocean, rather than those collected in deep traps. Global scale estimates derived from satellite data show, in keeping with earlier studies, that PEeff is high at high latitudes and low at low latitudes, but that Teff is low at high latitudes and high at low latitudes. However, in contrast to the relationship observed for deep biomineral fluxes in previous studies, we find that Teff is strongly negatively correlated with opal export flux from the upper ocean, but uncorrelated with calcium carbonate export flux. We hypothesize that the underlying factor governing the spatial patterns observed in Teff is ecosystem function, specifically the degree of recycling occurring in the upper ocean, rather than the availability of calcium carbonate for ballasting.

TI  - Iron, phytoplankton growth, and the carbon cycle
AB  - Iron is an essential nutrient for all living organisms. Iron is required for the synthesis of chlorophyll and of several photosynthetic electron transport proteins and for the reduction of CO2, SO4 2-, and NO3- during the photosynthetic production of organic compounds. Iron concentrations in vast areas of the ocean are very low (&lt; 1 nM) due to the low solubility of iron in oxic seawater. Low iron concentrations have been shown to limit primary production rates, biomass accumulation, and ecosystem structure in a variety of open-ocean environments, including the equatorial Pacific, the subarctic Pacific and the Southern Ocean and even in some coastal areas. Oceanic primary production, the transfer of carbon dioxide into organic carbon by photosynthetic plankton (phytoplankton), is one process by which atmospheric CO2 can be transferred to the deep ocean and sequestered for long periods of time. Accordingly, iron limitation of primary producers likely plays a major role in the global carbon cycle. It has been suggested that variations in oceanic primary productivity, spurred by changes in the deposition of iron in atmospheric dust, control atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and hence global climate, over glacial-interglacial timescales. A contemporary application of this "iron hypothesis" promotes the large-scale iron fertilization of ocean regions as a means of enhancing the ability of the ocean to store anthropogenic CO 2 and mitigate 21st century climate change. Recent in situ iron enrichment experiments in the HNLC regions, however, cast doubt on the efficacy and advisability of iron fertilization schemes. The experiments have confirmed the role of iron in regulating primary productivity, but resulted in only small carbon export fluxes to the depths necessary for long-term sequestration. Above all, these experiments and other studies of iron biogeochemistry over the last two decades have begun to illustrate the great complexity of the ocean system. Attempts to engineer this system are likely to provoke a similarly complex, unpredictable response.

TI  - Increased ocean carbon export in the Sargasso Sea linked to climate variability is countered by its enhanced mesopelagic attenuation
AB  - Photosynthetic CO2 uptake by oceanic phytoplankton and subsequent export of particulate organic carbon (POC) to the ocean interior comprises a globally significant biological carbon pump, controlled in part by the composition of the planktonic community. The strength and efficiency of this pump depends upon the balance of particle production in the euphotic zone and remineralization of those particles in the mesopelagic (defined here as depths between 150 and 300 m), but how these processes respond to climate-driven changes in the physical environment is not completely understood. In the Sargasso Sea, from similar to 1996-2007, we have observed a decade-long > 50\% increase in euphotic zone integrated autotrophic biomass (estimated from chlorophyll TChl-alpha), prokaryotic phytoplankton, primary production and shallow (150 m) POC export coinciding with a shift in the mean phase of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) from consistently positive to neutral but variable. During this same period mesopelagic POC flux attenuation has doubled such that carbon sequestration below 300 m, the maximum winter/spring ventilation depth, has not changed. The increased mesopelagic POC attenuation appears mediated by changes in plankton community composition and metabolic activity in both the euphotic and mesopelagic zones. These changes are counter to extant hypotheses regarding inter-relationships between phytoplankton community composition, productivity and carbon export, and have significant impacts on how the Sargasso Sea ecosystem, at least, is modeled. Moreover, these time-series observations suggest that processes in the euphotic zone and mesopelagic are tightly coupled and should be considered together in future research.

TI  - Ocean applications for carbon dioxide sequestration
AB  - Increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is being attributed to the adverse effects such as warming of the planet; increase in the sea level; variation in the atmospheric and ocean circulation patterns; snow cover variation; and, sea ice extent. One of the common approaches followed in the mitigation efforts is the study on the reduction of the emissions of CO2 from the major point sources such as coal fired power plants, steel plants, cement industries. Direct injection of the carbon dioxide into the deep oceans, mineral carbonation applications, in situ replacement of the gas hydrate into the carbon dioxide hydrates, micro algal sequestration and iron fertilization are some of the ocean sequestration options studied in the literature. Present chapter studies the feasibility of different ocean sequestration methods in comparison with the technological requirements for the realization of these methods. The relative merits of the methods, the technological challenges, ecological and environmental issues needing detailed studies for the application are discussed in this chapter. The experiments conducted on the mineral carbonation of industrial wastes such as steel slag using direct and indirect methods are discussed, considering the Linz-Donawitz converter slag. The carbonation efficiency for different conditions is compared and the structure of the resulting materials is analyzed. The prospective applications for coastal protective measures and artificial reef growth and the state of the art in similar applications using the concrete structure are discussed. The chapter discusses in detail the energy requirements in mineral carbonation methodology using the steel slag. Â© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

TI  - Threatened species drive the strength of the carbonate pump in the northern Scotia Sea
AB  - The efficiency of deep-ocean CO 2 sequestration is regulated by the relative balance between inorganic and organic carbon export respectively acting through the biological carbon pump (BCP) and the carbonate counter pump (CCP). The composition and abundance of calcifying species in the prevailing oceanic plankton community plays a major role in driving the CCP. Here we assess the role of these calcifying organisms in regulating the strength of the CCP in a Southern Ocean region (northern Scotia Sea) known to be a major hotspot for the drawdown of atmospheric CO 2 . We show that, when shelled pteropods dominate the calcifying community, the total annual reduction of CO 2 transferred to the deepÂ ocean doubles (17%) compared to when other plankton calcifiers dominate (3â€“9%). Furthermore, predation enhances their contribution through the removal of organic soft tissue. Pteropods are threatened in polar regions by ocean warming and acidification. We determine that their potential decline would have major implications to the comparative strengths of the BCP and CCP. Â© 2018, The Author(s).

TI  - Changing carbon-to-nitrogen ratios of organic-matter export under ocean acidification
AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) will affect marine biotas from the organism to the ecosystem level. Yet, the consequences for the biological carbon pump and thereby the oceanic sink for atmospheric CO(2)are still unclear. Here we show that OA considerably alters the C/N ratio of organic-matter export (C/N-export), a key factor determining efficiency of the biological pump. By synthesizing sediment-trap data from in situ mesocosm studies in different marine biomes, we find distinct but highly variable impacts of OA on C/N-export, reaching up to a 20\% increase/decrease under partial pressure of CO2(pCO(2)) conditions projected for 2100. These changes are driven by pCO(2) effects on a variety of plankton taxa and corresponding shifts in food-web structure. Notably, our findings suggest a pivotal role of heterotrophic processes in controlling the response of C/N(export)to OA, thus contradicting the paradigm of primary producers as the principal driver of biogeochemical responses to ocean change. The biological pump sequesters carbon to the deep ocean. Ocean acidification, through impacts on plankton and food-web structure, is shown to alter the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of organic material export, with heterotrophic processes playing a key role.

TI  - Embedding and slicing of intact in situ collected marine snow
AB  - The biological carbon pump is largely driven by the formation and sinking of marine snow. Because of their high organic matter content, marine snow aggregates are hotspots for microbial activity, and microbial organic matter degradation plays an important role in the attenuation of carbon fluxes to the deep sea. Our inability to examine and characterize microscale distributions of compounds making up the aggregate matrix, and of possible niches inside marine snow, has hindered our understanding of the basic processes governing marine carbon export and sequestration. To address this issue, we have adapted soft-embedding and sectioning to study the spatial structure and components of marine aggregates at high resolution. Soft-embedding enables rapid quantitative sampling of undisturbed marine aggregates from the water column and from sediment traps, followed by spatially resolved staining and characterization of substrates of the aggregate matrix and the microorganisms attached to it. Particular strengths of the method include in situ embedding in sediment traps and successful fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-probe labeling, supporting studies of microbial diversity and ecology. The high spatial resolution achieved by thin-sectioning of soft-embedded aggregates offers the possibility for improved understanding of the composition and structure of marine snow, which directly influence settling velocity, microbial colonization and diversity, degradation rates, and carbon content. Our method will help to elucidate the small-scale processes underlying large-scale carbon cycling in the marine environment, which is especially relevant in the context of rising anthropogenic CO2 emissions and global change.

TI  - Effects of patchy ocean fertilization on atmospheric carbon dioxide and biological production
AB  - Increasing oceanic productivity by fertilizing nutrient-rich regions with iron has been proposed as a mechanism to offset anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide. Earlier studies examined the impact of large-scale fertilization of vast reaches of the ocean for long periods of time. We use an ocean general circulation model to consider more realistic scenarios involving fertilizing small regions (a few hundred kilometers on a side) for limited periods of time (of order 1 month). A century after such a fertilization event, the reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide is between 2\% and 44\% of the initial pulse of organic carbon export to the abyssal ocean. The fraction depends on how rapidly the surface nutrient and carbon fields recover from the fertilization event. The modeled recovery is very sensitive to the representation of biological productivity and remineralization. Direct verification of the uptake would be nearly impossible since changes in the air-sea flux due to fertilization would be much smaller than those resulting from natural spatial variability. Because of the sensitivity of the uptake to the long-term fate of the iron and organic matter, indirect verification by measurement of the organic matter flux would require high vertical resolution and long-term monitoring. Finally, the downward displacement of the nutrient profile resulting from an iron-induced productivity spurt may paradoxically lead to a long-term reduction in biological productivity. In the worst-case scenario, removing 1 ton of carbon from the atmosphere for a century is associated with a 30-ton reduction in biological export of carbon.

TI  - Intelligent Control System of an Ecological Engineering Project for Carbon Sequestration in Coastal Mariculture Environments in China
AB  - As an ecological engineering project, artificial upwelling can enhance seaweed growth in the oligotrophic sea area by lifting bottom water, which is rich in nutrients, to the surface and thereby increase coastal carbon sequestration. Generally, engineering projects producing artificial upwelling occur far away from land and are self-powered using offshore solar energy or wind energy. The key to successfully implementing such engineering projects is to produce artificial upwelling with limited energy. With this in mind, an intelligent control system is designed for the energy management of the artificial upwelling engineering project that operates at AoShan Bay in Qingdao, China. This engineering project uses artificial upwelling to assist in the cultivation of macroalgae. The intelligent control system can automatically produce upwelling according to the battery condition and guarantee safety during operation. Meanwhile, users can monitor the system in real time with a Cloud platform. The functioning of the system and the effect of upwelling are confirmed by a sea trial. This research provides guidelines and technical support for the future design of intelligent control systems mounted on artificial upwelling engineering projects.

TI  - The impact of whaling on the ocean carbon cycle: Why bigger was better
AB  - Background: Humans have reduced the abundance of many large marine vertebrates, including whales, large fish, and sharks, to only a small percentage of their pre-exploitation levels. Industrial fishing and whaling also tended to preferentially harvest the largest species and largest individuals within a population. We consider the consequences of removing these animals on the ocean's ability to store carbon. Methodology/Principal Findings: Because body size is critical to our arguments, our analysis focuses on populations of baleen whales. Using reconstructions of pre-whaling and modern abundances, we consider the impact of whaling on the amount of carbon stored in living whales and on the amount of carbon exported to the deep sea by sinking whale carcasses. Populations of large baleen whales now store 9.16106 tons less carbon than before whaling. Some of the lost storage has been offset by increases in smaller competitors; however, due to the relative metabolic efficiency of larger organisms, a shift toward smaller animals could decrease the total community biomass by 30% or more. Because of their large size and few predators, whales and other large marine vertebrates can efficiently export carbon from the surface waters to the deep sea.We estimate that rebuilding whale populations would remove 1.66105 tons of carbon each year through sinking whale carcasses. Conclusions/Significance: Even though fish and whales are only a small portion of the ocean's overall biomass, fishing and whaling have altered the ocean's ability to store and sequester carbon. Although these changes are small relative to the total ocean carbon sink, rebuilding populations of fish and whales would be comparable to other carbon management schemes, including ocean iron fertilization.

TI  - Phytoplankton as key mediators of the biological carbon pump: Their responses to a changing climate
AB  - The world's oceans are a major sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). The biological carbon pump plays a vital role in the net transfer of CO2 from the atmosphere to the oceans and then to the sediments, subsequently maintaining atmospheric CO2 at significantly lower levels than would be the case if it did not exist. The efficiency of the biological pump is a function of phytoplankton physiology and community structure, which are in turn governed by the physical and chemical conditions of the ocean. However, only a few studies have focused on the importance of phytoplankton community structure to the biological pump. Because global change is expected to influence carbon and nutrient availability, temperature and light (via stratification), an improved understanding of how phytoplankton community size structure will respond in the future is required to gain insight into the biological pump and the ability of the ocean to act as a long-term sink for atmospheric CO2. This review article aims to explore the potential impacts of predicted changes in global temperature and the carbonate system on phytoplankton cell size, species and elemental composition, so as to shed light on the ability of the biological pump to sequester carbon in the future ocean.

TI  - Current and Future Potential of Shellfish and Algae Mariculture Carbon Sinks in China
AB  - Shellfish and algae mariculture make up an important part of the marine fishery carbon sink. Carbon sink research is necessary to ensure China achieves its goal of carbon neutrality. This study used the material quality assessment method to estimate the carbon sink capacity of shellfish and algae. Product value, carbon storage value, and oxygen release value were used to calculate the economic value of shellfish and algae carbon sequestration. The results showed that the annual average shellfish and algae carbon sink in China was 1.10 million tons from 2003 to 2019, of which shellfish accounted for 91.63\%, wherein Crassostrea gigas, Ruditapes philippinarum, and Chlamys farreri were the main contributors. The annual average economic value of China's shellfish and algae carbon sequestration was USD 71,303.56 million, and the product value was the main contributor, accounting for 99.11\%. The carbon sink conversion ratios of shellfish and algae were 8.37\% and 5.20\%, respectively, thus making shellfish the aquaculture species with the strongest carbon sink capacity and the greatest carbon sink potential. The estimated growth rate in the shellfish and algae removable carbon sink was 33,900 tons/year in China, but this trend was uncertain. The capacity for carbon sequestration and exchange by aquaculture can be improved by expanding breeding space, promoting multi-level comprehensive breeding modes, and marine artificial upwelling projects.

TI  - Numerical Flow Modeling of Artificial Ocean Upwelling
AB  - Artificial Upwelling (AU) of nutrient-rich Deep Ocean Water (DOW) to the ocean's sunlit surface layer has recently been put forward as a means of increasing marine CO2 sequestration and fish production. AU and its possible benefits have been studied in the context of climate change mitigation as well as food security for a growing human population. However, extensive research still needs to be done into the feasibility, effectiveness and potential risks, and side effects associated with AU to be able to better predict its potential. Fluid dynamic modeling of the AU process and the corresponding inorganic nutrient transport can provide necessary information for a better quantification of the environmental impacts of specific AU devices and represents a valuable tool for their optimization. Yet, appropriate capture of all flow phenomena relevant to the AU process remains a challenging task that only few models are able to accomplish. In this paper, simulation results obtained with a newly developed numerical solution method are presented. The method is based on the open-source modeling environment OpenFOAM. It solves the unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations with additional transport equations for energy, salinity, and inorganic nutrients. The method aims to be widely applicable to oceanic flow problems including temperature- and salinity-induced density stratification and passive scalar transport. The studies presented in this paper concentrate on the direct effects of the AU process on nutrient spread and concentration in the ocean's mixed surface layer. Expected flow phenomena are found to be captured well by the new method. While it is a known problem that cold DOW that is upwelled to the surface tends to sink down again due to its high density, the simulations presented in this paper show that the upwelled DOW settles at the lower boundary of the oceans mixed surface layer, thus keeping a considerable portion of the upwelled nutrients available for primary production. Comparative studies of several design variants, with the aim of maximizing the amount of nutrients that is retained inside the mixed surface layer, are also presented and analyzed.

TI  - Ocean fertilization and other climate change mitigation strategies: an overview
AB  - In order to evaluate ocean fertilization in the larger context of other proposed strategies for reducing the threat of the global warming, a wide range of different climate change mitigation approaches are compared in terms of their long-term potential, stage of development, relative costs and potential risks, as well as public acceptance. This broad comparative analysis is carried out for the following climate change mitigation strategies: supply-side and end-use efficiency improvements, terrestrial and geological carbon sequestration, CO2 ocean disposal and iron fertilization, nuclear power, and renewable energy generation from biomass, passive solar, solar thermal, photovoltaics, hydroelectric and wind. In addition, because of the inherent problems of conducting an objective comparative cost-benefit analysis, 2 non-technological solutions to global warming are also discussed: curbing population growth and transitioning to a steady-state economy.

TI  - The role of environmental factors in the long-term evolution of the marine biological pump
AB  - The biological pump-the transfer of atmospheric carbon dioxide to the ocean interior and marine sediments as organic carbon-plays a critical role in regulating the long-term carbon cycle, atmospheric composition and climate. Despite its centrality in the Earth system, the response of the biological pump to biotic innovation and climatic fluctuations through most stages of Earth's history has been largely conjectural. Here we use a mechanistic model of the biological carbon pump to revisit the factors controlling the transfer efficiency of carbon from surface waters to the ocean interior and marine sediments. We demonstrate that a shift from bacterioplankton-dominated to more eukaryote-rich ecosystems is unlikely to have considerably impacted the efficiency of Earth's biological pump. In contrast, the evolution of large zooplankton capable of vertical movement in the water column would have enhanced carbon transfer into the ocean interior. However, the impact of zooplankton on the biological carbon pump is still relatively minor when compared with environmental drivers. In particular, increased ocean temperatures and greater atmospheric oxygen abundance lead to notable decreases in global organic carbon transfer efficiency. Taken together, our results call into question causative links between algal diversification and planetary oxygenation and suggest that climate perturbations in Earth's history have played an important and underappreciated role in driving both carbon sequestration in the ocean interior and Earth surface oxygenation. Ocean temperature and atmospheric oxygen concentration are key factors in the long-term efficiency of the marine biological carbon pump, according to a mechanistic model of carbon transfer from surface waters to the deep ocean interior.

TI  - Proposing a potential strategy concerning Mineral-enhanced Biological Pump (MeBP) for improving Ocean Iron Fertilization (OIF)
AB  - Ocean iron fertilization (OIF) is a geoengineering strategy aimed at mitigating global warming by reducing the amount of atmospheric CO2. However, the efficacy by which OIF vertically exports organic carbon of bloomed phytoplankton (mostly, diatoms) to the deep sea is low because of the remineralization of organic carbon during the sinking of diatomaceous silica (BSi). To address the low efficiency of the vertical C export of OIF, a potential strategy for enhancing oceanic biological pump using clay minerals, so-called mineral-enhanced biological pump (MeBP), is proposed herein. Under ideal operation of MeBP, the purposefully added clay minerals are supposed to agglomerate with BSi, facilitating an increase in the quantity of BSi settling and a decrease of organic carbon loss. Meanwhile, the structural Al of clay minerals would be assimilated by diatoms due to the biological dissolution of the clays, inhibiting the dissolution of BSi during its sinking. The abovementioned effects would significantly improve the efficiency of the vertical C export of OIF. The preliminary evidence and arguments in support of MeBP are presented.

TI  - Geoengineering impact of open ocean dissolution of olivine on atmospheric CO2, surface ocean pH and marine biology
AB  - Ongoing global warming induced by anthropogenic emissions has opened the debate as to whether geoengineering is a `quick fix' option. Here we analyse the intended and unintended effects of one specific geoengineering approach, which is enhanced weathering via the open ocean dissolution of the silicate-containing mineral olivine. This approach would not only reduce atmospheric CO2 and oppose surface ocean acidification, but would also impact on marine biology. If dissolved in the surface ocean, olivine sequesters 0.28 g carbon per g of olivine dissolved, similar to land-based enhanced weathering. Silicic acid input, a byproduct of the olivine dissolution, alters marine biology because silicate is in certain areas the limiting nutrient for diatoms. As a consequence, our model predicts a shift in phytoplankton species composition towards diatoms, altering the biological carbon pumps. Enhanced olivine dissolution, both on land and in the ocean, therefore needs to be considered as ocean fertilization. From dissolution kinetics we calculate that only olivine particles with a grain size of the order of 1 mu m sink slowly enough to enable a nearly complete dissolution. The energy consumption for grinding to this small size might reduce the carbon sequestration efficiency by similar to 30\%.

TI  - Response of plankton community respiration under variable simulated upwelling events
AB  - Climate change is expected to alter the intensity and frequency of upwelling in high productive coastal regions, thus impacting nutrient fluxes, primary productivity and consequently carbon cycling. However, it is unknown how these changes will impact the planktonic (phytoplankton and bacteria) community structure, which affects community respiration (CR) and hence the carbon available for sequestration or transfer to upper trophic levels. Here we present results from a 37-day mesocosm experiment where we examined the response of CR to nutrient additions by simulating upwelling events at different intensities (low, medium, high and extreme) and modes (singular and recurring additions). We also analysed the potential contribution of different plankton size classes and functional groups to CR. The trend in accumulated CR with respect to nutrient fertilisation (total nitrogen added during the experiment) was linear in the two modes. Microplankton (mostly diatoms) and nanoplankton (small flagellates) dominated under extreme upwelling intensities and high CR in both singular and recurring upwelling modes, explaining >65\% of the observed variability in CR. In contrast, prokaryotic picoplankton (heterotrophic bacteria and autotrophic cyanobacteria) explained <43\% of the variance in CR under the rest of the upwelling intensities and modes tested. Changes in planktonic community structure, while modulating CR variability, would regulate the metabolic balance of the ecosystem, shifting it towards net-heterotrophy when the community is dominated by small heterotrophs and to net-autotrophy when large autotrophs prevail; although depending on the mode in which nutrients are supplied to the system. This shift in the dominance of planktonic organism will hence affect not only CR but also carbon sequestration in upwelling regions

TI  - Oceanic acidification affects marine carbon pump and triggers extended marine oxygen holes
AB  - Rising atmospheric CO2 levels will not only drive future global mean temperatures toward values unprecedented during the whole Quaternary but will also lead to massive acidification of sea water. This constitutes by itself an anthropogenic planetary-scale perturbation that could significantly modify oceanic biogeochemical fluxes and severely damage marine biota. As a step toward the quantification of such potential impacts, we present here a simulation-model-based assessment of the respective consequences of a business-as-usual fossil-fuel-burning scenario where a total of 4,075 Petagrams of carbon is released into the atmosphere during the current millennium. In our scenario, the atmospheric pCO(2) level peaks at approximate to 1,750 mu atm in the year 2200 while the sea-surface pH value drops by >0.7 units on global average, inhibiting the growth of marine calcifying organisms. The study focuses on quantifying 3 major concomitant effects. The first one is a significant (climate-stabilizing) negative feedback on rising pCO(2) levels as caused by the attenuation of biogenic calcification. The second one is related to the biological carbon pump. Because mineral ballast, notably CaCO3, is found to play a dominant role in carrying organic matter through the water column, a reduction of its export fluxes weakens the strength of the biological carbon pump. There is, however, a third effect with severe consequences: Because organic matter is oxidized in shallow waters when mineral-ballast fluxes weaken, oxygen holes (hypoxic zones) start to expand considerably in the oceans in our model world-with potentially harmful impacts on a variety of marine ecosystems.

TI  - Nutrient uptake plasticity in phytoplankton sustains future ocean net primary production
AB  - Annually, marine phytoplankton convert approximately 50 billion tons of dissolved inorganic carbon to particulate and dissolved organic carbon, a portion of which is exported to depth via the biological carbon pump. Despite its important roles in regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide via carbon sequestration and in sustaining marine ecosystems, model-projected future changes in marine net primary production are highly uncertain even in the sign of the change. Here, using an Earth system model, we show that frugal utilization of phosphorus by phytoplankton under phosphate-stressed conditions can overcompensate the previously projected 21st century declines due to ocean warming and enhanced stratification. Our results, which are supported by observations from the Hawaii Ocean Time-series program, suggest that nutrient uptake plasticity in the subtropical ocean plays a key role in sustaining phytoplankton productivity and carbon export production in a warmer world.

TI  - Uncertain response of ocean biological carbon export in a changing world
AB  - The transfer of organic carbon from the upper to the deep ocean by particulate export flux is the starting point for the long-term storage of photosynthetically fixed carbon. This `biological carbon pump' is a critical component of the global carbon cycle, reducing atmospheric CO2 levels by similar to 200 ppm relative to a world without export flux. This carbon flux also fuels the productivity of the mesopelagic zone, including important fisheries. Here we show that, despite its importance for understanding future ocean carbon cycling, Earth system models disagree on the projected response of the global export flux to climate change, with estimates ranging from -41\% to +1.8\%. Fundamental constraints to understanding export flux arise because a myriad of interconnected processes make the biological carbon pump challenging to both observe and model. Our synthesis prioritizes the processes likely to be most important to include in modern-day estimates (particle fragmentation and zooplankton vertical migration) and future projections (phytoplankton and particle size spectra and temperature-dependent remineralization) of export. We also identify the observations required to achieve more robust characterization, and hence improved model parameterization, of export flux and thus reduce uncertainties in current and future estimates in the overall cycling of carbon in the ocean.

TI  - Potential climate engineering effectiveness and side effects during a high carbon dioxide-emission scenario
AB  - The realization that mitigation efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions have, until now, been relatively ineffective has led to an increasing interest in climate engineering as a possible means of preventing the potentially catastrophic consequences of climate change. While many studies have addressed the potential effectiveness of individual methods there have been few attempts to compare them. Here we use an Earth system model to compare the effectiveness and side effects of afforestation, artificial ocean upwelling, ocean iron fertilization, ocean alkalinization and solar radiation management during a high carbon dioxide-emission scenario. We find that even when applied continuously and at scales as large as currently deemed possible, all methods are, individually, either relatively ineffective with limited (<8\%) warming reductions, or they have potentially severe side effects and cannot be stopped without causing rapid climate change. Our simulations suggest that the potential for these types of climate engineering to make up for failed mitigation may be very limited.

TI  - Ocean fertilization with iron: effects on climate and air quality
AB  - It is well known that iron fertilization can increase primary production and hence CO2 drawdown over a significant fraction of the oceans. What is less well established is the extent to which this leads to long-term sequestration of carbon to the deep oceans, and to feedbacks to the atmosphere arising from increased biological activity. In this note results for changes in trace gas concentrations during an iron addition experiment in the Southern Ocean are presented. They demonstrate that a complex situation exists; some gases (DMS, CH3I, CHBr2Cl) show increases in concentration following fertilization with iron while others show no change (CH3ONO2, CH2ClI) or even a decrease (CHBr3). The concomitant effects on air-sea fluxes of these gases are potentially important for climate and atmospheric composition.

TI  - Plankton networks driving carbon export in the oligotrophic ocean
AB  - The biological carbon pump is the process by which CO2 is transformed to organic carbon via photosynthesis, exported through sinking particles, and finally sequestered in the deep ocean. While the intensity of the pump correlates with plankton community composition, the underlying ecosystem structure driving the process remains largely uncharacterized. Here we use environmental and metagenomic data gathered during the Tara Oceans expedition to improve our understanding of carbon export in the oligotrophic ocean. We show that specific plankton communities, from the surface and deep chlorophyll maximum, correlate with carbon export at 150 m and highlight unexpected taxa such as Radiolaria and alveolate parasites, as well as Synechococcus and their phages, as lineages most strongly associated with carbon export in the subtropical, nutrient-depleted, oligotrophic ocean. Additionally, we show that the relative abundance of a few bacterial and viral genes can predict a significant fraction of the variability in carbon export in these regions.

TI  - Geoengineering with seagrasses: is credit due where credit is given?
AB  - Blue carbon, the carbon fixed by vegetated coastal ecosystems including seagrasses, is reported to have a large potential to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide. Planting, expanding or protecting seagrass meadows has, accordingly, been proposed as a form of geoengineering. Seagrasses are reported to account for up to 18\% of the carbon burial in the world's oceans, which is on the same order of magnitude as other proposed geoengineering techniques, including iron fertilization. International protocols have been developed to quantify carbon sequestration in seagrass meadows, with a view to awarding carbon credits under the Verified Carbon Standard. Unfortunately, because these protocols do not adequately account for post-depositional processes in marine sediment, they significantly overestimate carbon capture by seagrass beds and give an incorrect view of its distribution. Specifically, neglecting biomixing and remineralization of carbon in surface sediments biases burial rates high, while using sediment carbon inventory (soil carbon stock) over the top 1 m as a proxy for burial rate incorrectly identifies areas of high carbon burial. Seagrass beds likely provide a limited setting for geoengineering, because they generally comprise slowly-accumulating, fine to medium sand, which captures organic carbon less efficiently than fine-grained sediments or rapidly-accumulating delta deposits. While there is no question that seagrass meadows provide valuable habitat, nor that they are disappearing rapidly, their contribution to the global burial of carbon has not yet been established. The danger of geoengineering with seagrasses before reliable assessment methods have been established is that overestimated carbon offsets could lead to a net increase in emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.

TI  - Biological Carbon Pump Sequestration Efficiency in the North Atlantic: A Leaky or a Long-Term Sink?
AB  - The North Atlantic Ocean is a key region for carbon sequestration by the biological carbon pump (BCP). The quantity of organic carbon exported from the surface, the region and depth at which it is remineralized, and the subsequent timescale of ventilation (return of the remineralized carbon back into contact with the atmosphere), control the magnitude of BCP sequestration. Carbon stored in the ocean for >100 years is assumed to be sequestered for climate-relevant timescales. We apply Lagrangian tracking to an ocean circulation and marine biogeochemistry model to determine the fate of North Atlantic organic carbon export. Organic carbon assumed to undergo remineralization at each of three vertical horizons (500, 1,000, and 2,000 m) is tracked to determine how much remains out of contact with the atmosphere for 100 years. The fraction that remains below the mixed layer for 100 years is defined as the sequestration efficiency (SEff) of remineralized exported carbon. For exported carbon remineralized at the 500, 1,000 and 2,000 m horizons, the SEff is 28\%, 66\% and 94\%, respectively. Calculating the amount of carbon sequestered using depths <= 1,000 m, and not accounting for downstream ventilation, overestimates 100-year carbon sequestration by at least 39\%. This work has implications for the accuracy of future carbon sequestration estimates, which may be overstated, and for carbon management strategies (e.g., oceanic carbon dioxide removal and Blue Carbon schemes) that require long-term sequestration to be successful.

TI  - Carbon capture and sequestration potential of Chaetoceros sp. In iron rich ground water
AB  - Carbon sequestration using phytoplanktons in the world oceans is one of the wise options to mitigate global warming. The increased growth of phytoplanktons would consume more carbon di oxide and thus much of the carbon can be sequestrated in the oceans. However, the less availability of iron over large areas of the ocean limits primary productivity by phytoplanktons and the associated uptake of carbon. And hence, iron fertilization in the marine environment is used to improve the growth and carbon uptake potentials of phytoplanktons. Usually various sources of irons are being tested for their efficiency in enhancing the growth of phytoplanktons in the oceans. Here, for the first time the natural iron rich groundwater is used as an iron source to increase the growth and carbon sequestration potential of marine phytoplankton (Chaetoceros sp.) in vitro. Our in vitro studies concluded that iron at not less than 3 ppm concentration was found to enhance the growth of selected phytoplankton Chaetoceros sp. Iron rich ground water as a source of iron (5 ppm) in f/2 medium has remarkably enhanced the growth (OD 0.208 @ 620nm) and fresh (0.244 g) and dry weight (0.007 g) of the selected phytoplankton. In order to demonstrate the effect of phytoplankton growth on the carbon sequestration, the growth of algae and the content of chlorophyll, protein, total carbohydrate and total organic carbon were estimated. At highest concentration of iron in the form of iron rich ground water in the growth medium has increased the content of chlorophylls, intra and extra cellular proteins, total carbohydrate content. Moreover, the iron supply has enhanced the total organic carbon in the algal biomass which indicates that enhancing carbon sequestration by Chaetoceros sp. (phytoplankton) is possible while using natural iron rich ground water as the source of iron. Â© Global Science Publications.

TI  - Effect of iron supply on Southern Ocean CO2 uptake and implications for glacial atmospheric CO2
AB  - Photosynthesis by marine phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean, and the associated uptake of carbon, is thought to be currently limited by the availability of iron. One implication of this limitation is that a larger iron supply to the region in glacial times could have stimulated algal photosynthesis, leading to lower concentrations of atmospheric CO2. Similarly, it has been proposed that artificial iron fertilization of the oceans might increase future carbon sequestration. Here we report data from a whole-ecosystem test of the iron-limitation hypothesis in the Southern Ocean, which show that surface uptake of atmospheric CO2 and uptake ratios of silica to carbon by phytoplankton were strongly influenced by nanomolar increases of iron concentration. We use these results to inform a model of global carbon and ocean nutrients, forced with atmospheric iron fluxes to the region derived from the Vostok ice-core dust record. During glacial periods, predicted magnitudes and timings of atmospheric CO2 changes match ice-core records well. At glacial terminations, the model suggests that forcing of Southern Ocean biota by iron caused the initial ~40 p.p.m. of glacial-interglacial CO2 change, but other mechanisms must have accounted for the remaining 40 p.p.m. increase. The experiment also confirms that modest sequestration of atmospheric CO2 by artificial additions of iron to the Southern Ocean is in principle possible, although the period and geographical extent over which sequestration would be effective remain poorly known.

AB  - Addressing the threats posed by global climate change by reducing the number of greenhouse gases is currently one of the most important research goals of the scientific community. Ocean iron fertilization (OIF) is a geoengineering strategy aimed at mitigating global warming through human intervention. The OIF concept is based on the idea that artificial adding of iron nutrients into iron-depleted regions of the ocean will lead to a rapid boost of phytoplankton populations and the mass sinking of organic matter that ultimately leads to the sequestration of significant amounts of atmospheric CO2 in the deep sea and sediments. The OIF experiments have been conducted in past over the time and the space scales of weeks and kilometres in polar, subpolar and tropical areas of the oceans. The results have generated new knowledge and a better understanding of the role of iron in regulating marine ecosystems and have confirmed that the iron supply is one of the key controls on the dynamics of phytoplankton blooms, such as diatom as the base of the marine food chain, which in turn affect the whole biogeochemical cycling of carbon. However, the OIF as an effective carbon control strategy is not adequately supported with concerns about potential significant impacts on marine ecosystems. The iron fertilization also did not significantly strengthen the vertical carbon export to the deep sea and thereby the sequestration of CO2. The efficacy by which the OIF vertically exports organic carbon associated with diatom blooms to the deep sea remains constrained due to the remineralization and the loss of organic carbon during the sinking process of diatomaceous biogenic silica (BSi). Therefore, to address these limitations, the next generation of the IOF geoengineering experiments should be designed to improve the low efficiency of the vertical export of bloomed phytoplankton, which will reduce the loss of organic carbon during the sinking of biomass. In our recent studies, we observed a noticeable dissolution-inhibition effect of Al-bearing lake diatomaceous BSi, which is caused by the high content of Al incorporation in the structure of the BSi. This finding inspired a new idea about the possibility of incorporating naturally occurring, environmentally safe and Al-rich minerals as an Al source for the geoengineering experiments. We hypothesize that clay minerals, with characteristically high contents of Al and Si, might be good ingredients for mineral fertilization in geoengineering experiments to enhance the efficiency of the vertical carbon export of the biological pump. This new proposed mineral-aided process is termed mineral-enhanced biological pump (MeBP). In this paper, the concept, background and theoretical basis of MeBP for CO2 sequestration in water bodies as a new and inexpensive geoengineering strategy are explained. The basic idea of the MeBP concept is to use finely grained powders of minerals, such as clay minerals as nutrients for geoengineering or ecological engineering experiment to enhance the efficiency of the complexes of microbial organic matter and minerals and to hinder the loss of particulate organic carbon by adjusting the mineral ratios and regulating the particle properties. If so, the improved carbon sequestration efficiency of the biological pump and the CO2 sink enhancement in water bodies could be achieved. The MeBP offers several potential advantages such as application simplicity, low-cost, scalability, environmental friendliness, and flexibility, and it could be applied alone or in combination with other carbon sequestration strategies. Also, the approaches for the research and application of MeBP, the environmental and ecological risks of applying MeBP and the possible ways of avoiding these risks are discussed. These discussions aim to stimulate new thinking toward the development of new technologies of increasing carbon sink in water bodies that are sustainable, ecologically acceptable and scalable, and can be translated into real applications and engineering practices.

TI  - Seeking natural analogs to fast-forward the assessment of marine CO2 removal
AB  - Mitigating global climate change will require gigaton-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR) as a supplement to rapid emissions reduction. The oceans cover 71% of the Earth surface and have the potential to provide much of the required CDR. However, none of the proposed marine CDR (mCDR) methods is sufficiently well understood to determine their real-world efficiency and environmental side effects. Here, we argue that using natural mCDR analogs should become the third interconnecting pillar in the mCDR assessment as they bridge the gap between numerical simulations (i.e., large scale/reduced complexity) and experimental studies (i.e., small scale/high complexity). Natural mCDR analogs occur at no cost, can provide a wealth of data to inform mCDR, and do not require legal permission or social license for their study. We propose four simple criteria to identify particularly useful analogs: 1) large scale, 2) abruptness of perturbation, 3) availability of unperturbed control sites, and 4) reoccurrence. Based on these criteria, we highlight four examples: 1) equatorial upwelling as a natural analog for artificial upwelling, 2) downstream of Kerguelen Island for ocean iron fertilization, 3) the Black and Caspian Seas for ocean alkalinity enhancement, and 4) the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt for ocean afforestation. These natural analogs provide a reality check for experimental assessments and numerical modeling of mCDR. Ultimately, projections of mCDR efficacy and sustainability supported by observations from natural analogs will provide the real-world context for the public debate and will facilitate political decisions on mCDR implementation. We anticipate that a rigorous investigation of natural analogs will fast-forward the urgently needed assessment of mCDR. Â© 2021 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

TI  - Quantifying the Carbon Export and Sequestration Pathways of the Ocean's Biological Carbon Pump
AB  - The ocean's biological carbon pump transfers carbon from the surface ocean to the deep ocean by several distinct pathways, including gravitational settling of organic particles, mixing and advection of suspended organic carbon, and active transport by vertically migrating metazoans. Carbon exported by these pathways can be sequestered as respired CO2 in the deep ocean for years to centuries. However, the contribution of each pathway to carbon export and sequestration remains highly uncertain. Here, satellite and in situ ocean biogeochemical observations are assimilated in an ensemble numerical model of the biological pump to quantify global and regional carbon export and sequestration. The ensemble mean global carbon export is 10.2 Pg C yr(-1) and the total amount of carbon sequestered via the biological pump is 1,300 Pg C. The gravitational pump is responsible for 70\% of the total global carbon export, 85\% of which is zooplankton fecal pellets and 15\% is sinking phytoplankton aggregates, while migrating zooplankton account for 10\% of total export and physical mixing is responsible for the remaining 20\%. These pathways have different sequestration times, with an average of 140 years for the gravitational pump, 150 years for the migrant pump, and only 50 years for the mixing pump. Regionally, the largest sequestration inventories and longest sequestration times are found in the northern high latitudes, while the shortest sequestration times are found in the subtropical gyres. These results suggest that ocean carbon storage will weaken as the oceans stratify and the subtropical gyres expand due to anthropogenic climate change. Plain Language Summary Tiny organisms called phytoplankton help to reduce atmospheric CO2 levels by absorbing large amounts of carbon in the surface ocean during photosynthesis. Various biological and physical processes, or pathways, then work together to transfer some of this carbon to the deep ocean where it can be stored for potentially hundreds of years. In this study, we examined these pathways using computer models that are consistent with data from satellite-based sensors and ocean observations. Our model shows that the most important pathways for carbon storage are transport by sinking particles and swimming zooplankton, while transport by ocean currents is the least important pathway. The North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans have the greatest carbon storage power, while the subtropical oceans have the least. These results imply that ocean carbon storage may decrease in the future, because subtropical regions will expand in a warming climate.

TI  - CO2capture by pumping surface acidity to the deep ocean
AB  - To remain below 2 Â°C of warming, most IPCC pathways call for active CO2 removal (CDR). On geological timescales, ocean uptake regulates atmospheric CO2 concentration, with two homeostats driving CO2 uptake: dissolution of deep ocean carbonate deposits (1 ka timescales) and terrestrial weathering of silicate rocks (100 ka timescales). Many current ocean-based CDR proposals effectively act to accelerate the latter. Here we present a method which relies purely on the redistribution and dilution of acidity from a thin layer of the surface ocean to a thicker layer of deep ocean, in order to reduce surface acidification and accelerate carbonate homeostasis. This downward transport could be seen analogous to the action of the natural biological carbon pump. The method offers advantages over other ocean alkalinity and CO2-stripping methods: the conveyance of mass is minimized (acidity is pumped in situ to depth), and expensive mining, grinding and distribution of alkaline material is eliminated. No dilute substance needs to be concentrated, reducing the quantity of seawater to be processed. Finally, no terrestrial material is added to the ocean, avoiding significant alteration of seawater ion concentrations or issues with heavy metal toxicity (encountered in mineral-based alkalinity schemes). The artificial transport of acidity accelerates the natural deep ocean compensation by calcium carbonate. It has been estimated that the total compensation capacity of the ocean is on the order of 1500 GtC. We show through simulation that pumping of ocean acidity could remove up to 150 GtC from the atmosphere by 2100 without excessive increase of local pH. The permanence of the CO2 storage depends on the depth of acid pumping. At >3000 m, âˆ¼85% is retained for at least 300 years, and >50% for at least 2000 years. Shallow pumping (<2000 m) offers more of a stop-gap deferral of emissions for a few hundred years. Uptake efficiency and residence time also vary with the location of acidity pumping. Requiring only local resources (ocean water and energy), this method could be uniquely suited to utilize otherwise-unusable open ocean energy sources at scale. We present a brief techno-economic estimate of 130-250$ per tCO2 at current prices and as low as 93$ per tCO2 under modest learning-curve assumptions. Â© 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

TI  - Effect of Ocean Iron Fertilization on the Phytoplankton Biological Carbon Pump
AB  - It has been proposed that photosynthetic plankton can be used as a biological carbon pump tp absorb and sequester carbon dioxide in the ocean. In this paper, plankton population dynamics are simulated in a single stratified water column to predict carbon dioxide sequestering due to surface iron fertilization in deep ocean. Using a predator-prey model and realistic parameter values, iron fertilization was found to only cause temporary blooms up to 5 months in duration, and relatively small increases in adsorption of atmospheric CO(2).

TI  - POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF IRON FERTILIZATION IN THE SOUTHERN OCEAN ON ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATION
AB  - Recently, it was proposed (Baum, 1990 and Martin et al., 1990a, 1990b) that the southern ocean should be fertilized with iron to stimulate biological productivity, thus enhancing the flux of organic carbon from surface to depth, thereby lowering the concentration of inorganic carbon in surface water and in turn the atmospheric CO2 concentration. We explore the possible impact of a hypothetical iron fertilization on atmospheric CO2 levels during the next century using a high-latitude exchange/interior diffusion advection model. Assuming as an upper-limit scenario that it is possible to stimulate the uptake of the abundant nutrients in the southern ocean, the maximum atmospheric CO2 depletion is 58 ppm after 50 years and 107 ppm after 100 years. This scenario requires completely effective Fe fertilization to be carried out over 16\% of the world ocean area. Sensitivity studies and comparison with other models suggest that the errors in these limits due to uncertainties in the transport parameters, which are determined by calibrating the model with radiocarbon and validated with CFC-11 measurements, range from-29\% to +17\%. If iron stimulated biological productivity is halted during the six winter months, the additional oceanic CO2 uptake is reduced by 18\%. Possible changes in surface water alkalinity alter the result of iron fertilization by less than +9\% to-28\%. Burial of the iron-induced particle flux as opposed to remineralization in the deep ocean has virtually no influence on the atmospheric response for the considered time scale of 100 years. If iron fertilization were terminated, CO2 would escape from the ocean and soon cancel the effect of the fertilization. The factors which determine the atmospheric CO2 reduction most strongly are the area of fertilization, the extent to which biology utilizes the abundant nutrients, and the magnitude of future CO2 emissions. The possible effect of fertilizing the ocean with iron is small compared to the expected atmospheric CO2 increase over the next century, unless the increase is kept small by means of stringent measures to control CO2 emissions.

TI  - Fear and loathing in the pelagic: How the seascape of fear impacts the biological carbon pump
AB  - The biological carbon pump transports photosynthetically fixed carbon from surface waters to depths. It removes carbon from the atmosphere and sequesters it in the deep ocean, playing an important role in global climate regulation. As the biological carbon pump is directly related to biological processes, it is heavily influenced by the biomass and trophic interactions between populations in the ecosystem. However, behavioral responses and adaptations to predation risk change trophic interactions, potentially having larger impacts than direct effects on trophic interactions and population abundances. Thus, predation risk may play an important role in shaping the biological carbon pump's strength (how much carbon leaves the euphotic zone) and efficiency (what fraction of detritus reaches a certain depth without being degraded). Except in the case of active carbon transport by vertically migrating organisms, this role of risk is not generally recognized. Here, we synthesize the existing knowledge on the consequences of anti-predation responses on the biological carbon pump. First, we consider a generic anti-predation response and investigate the different direct, indirect, and cascading effects that the response can induce. Then, we focus on pelagic anti-predation responses and detail how they can specifically alter the different components of the pump. Finally, we discuss points to consider in biological carbon pump studies and highlight directions for future research. In particular, there is a need for more quantitative research to evaluate the importance of anti-predation responses in shaping the biological carbon pump.

TI  - An open ocean trial of controlled upwelling using wave pump technology
AB  - In 1976, John D. Isaacs proposed to use wave energy to invert the density structure of the ocean and pump deep, nutrient-rich water into the sunlit surface layers. The basic principle is simple: a length of tubing attached to a surface buoy at the top, and a one-way valve at the bottom can be extended below the euphotic zone to act as a conduit for deep water. The vertical motion of the ocean forces the attached valve to open on the downslope of a wave and close on the upslope, thus generating upward movement of deep water to the surface ocean. Although Isaacs's wave-powered pump has taken many forms, from energy production to aquaculture to the more recent suggestion that artificial upwelling could be used to stimulate primary productivity and carbon sequestration, the simple engineering concept remains the same. In June 2008, the authors tested a commercially available wave pump (Atmocean) north of Oahu, Hawaii, to assess the logistics of at-sea deployment and the durability of the equipment under open ocean conditions. This test was done as part of an experiment designed to evaluate a recently published hypothesis that upwelling of water containing excess phosphate (P) relative to nitrogen (N) compared to the canonical "Redfield" molar ratio of 16N:1P would generate a two-phased phytoplankton bloom. The end result of this field experiment was rapid delivery (&lt;2 h for a 300-m transit) of deep water to the surface ocean followed by catastrophic failure of pump materials under the dynamic stresses of the oceanic environment. Wave-driven upwelling of cold water was documented for a period of ~17 h, with a volumetric upwelling rate of ~45 m3 h-1 and an estimated total input of 765 m3 of nutrient-enriched deep water. The authors discuss the deployment of a 300-m wave pump, the strategy to sample a biogeochemical response, the engineering challenges faced, and the implications of these results for future experiments aimed at stimulating the growth of phytoplankton.

TI  - Sequestration of carbon dioxide by ocean fertilization
AB  - Sequestration of carbon dioxide to the deep ocean by the fertilization of high nutrient, low chlorophyll (HNLC) ocean waters can be an answer to tile concerns arising from the increasing carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere. This approach has the potential to sequester about 400,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide by repeated episodic fertilizations of the Pacific equatorial current for a cost of about \$2.00/ton of carbon dioxide and for 1000 to 2000 years. A technology demonstration is planned to fertilize an area of 5,000 square miles of the equatorial Pacific that is expected to sequester between 600,000 and 2,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide in a period of 20 days. The ecological changes expected consist of the increase in diatoms, which double or triple each day until the limiting fertilizing element is used up. No adverse changes are expected, since this is exactly what happens naturally when episodic fertilization occurs in the open ocean. The concept is that fertilization of HNLC waters with chelated iron will cause a bloom of phytoplankton that sink below the thermocline into deep water due to their high density after they die. The experiment, while large by land comparisons, is small in terms of ocean area, about one square degree at the equator. The demonstration protocol will include measurements of the amount of carbon dioxide that is removed from the surface layer and the amount of organic carbon that is produced and exported to the ocean depths as well as other effects in the water column over a period of 20 days. After this time no further effects of iron fertilization are expected to take place because macronutrient elements (N, P and Si) are depleted to limiting concentrations. Since tile iron enrichment is transient, no steady-state modification of the food web will occur. The experiment will be carried out outside the EEZ of any nation, as were the previous five experimental voyages, so, like them, no permits will be required. The five recent ocean experiments observed iron stimulation of phytoplankton growth, but the effects were difficult to quantify in the 9 to 28 square mile experiments since eddy diffusion along the edges of the patch diluted the bloom. This problem will be minimized in the planned technology demonstration because its larger area restricts the diffusion from the center of the patch to less than 2\% of the concentration over the 20 day period of the test.

TI  - Evaluation of the sinks and sources of atmospheric CO2 by artificial upwelling
AB  - Artificial upwelling is considered a promising way to reduce the accumulation of anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This practice could transport nutrient-rich deep water to the euphotic zone, enhance phytoplankton growth and consequently increase organic carbon exportation to the deep ocean via the biological pump. However, only a few studies quantitatively assess changes in oceanic CO2 uptake resulting from artificial upwelling. This article uses a simulation to examine the effect of hypothetical artificial upwelling-induced variations of CO2 fugacity in seawater (fCO2) using observed carbon and nutrient data from 14 stations, ranging from 21 to 43Â°N, in the West Philippine Sea (WPS), the East China Sea (ECS) and the Sea of Japan. Calculations are based on two basic assumptions: First, a near-field mixing of a nutrient-rich deep-ocean water plume in a stratified ocean environment is assumed to form given the presence of an artificial upwelling devise with appropriate technical parameters. Second, it is assumed that photosynthesis of marine phytoplankton could deplete all available nutrients following the stoichiometry of the modified Redfield ratio C/H/O/N/S/P=103.1/181.7/93.4/11.7/2.1/1. Results suggest artificial upwelling has significant effects on regional changes in sea-air differences (Î´fCO2sea-air) and the carbon sequestration potential (Î´fCO2mixed-amb). Large variations of Î´fCO2sea-air and Î´fCO2mixed-amb are shown to be associated with different regions, seasons and technical parameters of the artificial upwelling device. With proper design, it is possible to reverse the contribution of artificial upwelling from a strong CO2 source to sink. Thus, artificial upwelling has the potential to succeed as a geoengineering technique to sequester anthropogenic CO2, with appropriate technical parameters in the right region and season.

TI  - Predictable and efficient carbon sequestration in the North Pacific Ocean supported by symbiotic nitrogen fixation
AB  - The atmospheric and deep sea reservoirs of carbon dioxide are linked via physical, chemical, and biological processes. The last of these include photosynthesis, particle settling, and organic matter remineralization, and are collectively termed the "biological carbon pump." Herein, we present results from a 13-y (1992-2004) sediment trap experiment conducted in the permanently oligotrophic North Pacific Subtropical Gyre that document a large, rapid, and predictable summertime (July 15-August 15) pulse in particulate matter export to the deep sea (4,000 m). Peak daily fluxes of particulate matter during the summer export pulse (SEP) average 408, 283, 24.1, 1.1, and 67.5 Î¼molÂ·m -2Â·d -1 for total carbon, organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus (PP), and biogenic silica, respectively. The SEP is approximately threefold greater than mean wintertime particle fluxes and fuels more efficient carbon sequestration because of low remineralization during downward transit that leads to elevated total carbon/PP and organic carbon/PP particle stoichiometry (371:1 and 250:1, respectively). Our long-term observations suggest that seasonal changes in the microbial assemblage, namely, summertime increases in the biomass and productivity of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria in association with diatoms, are the main cause of the prominent SEP. The recurrent SEP is enigmatic because it is focused in time despite the absence of any obvious predictable stimulus or habitat condition. We hypothesize that changes in day length (photoperiodism) may be an important environmental cue to initiate aggregation and subsequent export of organic matter to the deep sea.

TI  - An interdisciplinary assessment of climate engineering strategies
AB  - Mitigating further anthropogenic changes to the global climate will require reducing greenhouse-gas emissions ({''}abatement{''}), or else removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and/or diminishing solar input ({''}climate engineering{''}). Here, we develop and apply criteria to measure technical, economic, ecological, institutional, and ethical dimensions of, and public acceptance for, climate engineering strategies; provide a relative rating for each dimension; and offer a new interdisciplinary framework for comparing abatement and climate engineering options. While abatement remains the most desirable policy, certain climate engineering strategies, including forest and soil management for carbon sequestration, merit broad-scale application. Other proposed strategies, such as biochar production and geological carbon capture and storage, are rated somewhat lower, but deserve further research and development. Iron fertilization of the oceans and solar radiation management, although cost-effective, received the lowest ratings on most criteria. We conclude that although abatement should remain the central climate-change response, some low-risk, cost-effective climate engineering approaches should be applied as complements. The framework presented here aims to guide and prioritize further research and analysis, leading to improvements in climate engineering strategies.

TI  - Iron fertilisation and century-scale effects of open ocean dissolution of olivine in a simulated CO2 removal experiment
AB  - Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) approaches are efforts to reduce the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Here we use a marine carbon cycle model to investigate the effects of one CDR technique: the open ocean dissolution of the iron-containing mineral olivine. We analyse the maximum CDR potential of an annual dissolution of 3 Pg olivine during the 21st century and focus on the role of the micro-nutrient iron for the biological carbon pump. Distributing the products of olivine dissolution (bicarbonate, silicic acid, iron) uniformly in the global surface ocean has a maximum CDR potential of 0.57 gC/g-olivine mainly due to the alkalinisation of the ocean, with a significant contribution from the fertilisation of phytoplankton with silicic acid and iron. The part of the CDR caused by ocean fertilisation is not permanent, while the CO2 sequestered by alkalinisation would be stored in the ocean as long as alkalinity is not removed from the system. For high CO2 emission scenarios the CDR potential due to the alkalinity input becomes more efficient over time with increasing ocean acidification. The alkalinity-induced CDR potential scales linearly with the amount of olivine, while the iron-induced CDR saturates at 113 PgC per century (on average PgC yr-1) for an iron input rate of 2.3 Tg Fe yr-1 (1% of the iron contained in 3 Pg olivine). The additional iron-related CO2 uptake occurs in the Southern Ocean and in the iron-limited regions of the Pacific. Effects of this approach on surface ocean pH are small (&lt; 0.01).

TI  - The microbial carbon pump concept: Potential biogeochemical significance in the globally changing ocean
AB  - Three vertical ocean carbon pumps have been known for almost three decades to sequester atmospheric carbon in the deep-water and sediment reservoirs, i.e. the solubility pump, the carbonate pump, and the soft-tissue (also known as organic, or biological) carbon pump (BCP). These three pumps maintain the vertical gradient in total dissolved inorganic carbon between the surface and deep waters. The more recently proposed microbial carbon pump (MCP) would maintain a gradient between short- and long-lived dissolved organic carbon (DOC; average lifetimes of <100 and >100 years, respectively). Long-lived DOC is an additional proposed reservoir of sequestered carbon in the ocean. This review: examines critically aspects of the vertical ocean carbon pumps and the MCP, in particular their physical dimensions and their potential roles in carbon sequestration; normalises the dimensions of the MCP to allow direct comparisons with the three vertical ocean carbon pumps; compares the MCP and vertical ocean carbon pumps; organises in a coherent framework the information available in the literature on refractory DOC; explores the potential effects of the globally changing ocean on the MCP; and identifies the assumptions that generally underlie the MCP studies, as bases for future research. The study: proposes definitions of terms, expressions and concepts related to the four ocean carbon pumps (i.e. three vertical pumps and MCP); defines the magnitude for the MCP as the rate of production of DOC with an average lifetime of >100 years and provides its first estimate for the World Ocean, i.e. 0.2 Pg C year(-1); and introduces an operational ``first-time-sequestration{'' criterion that prevents organic carbon fluxes from being assigned to both the BCP and the MCP. In our review of the potential effects of predicted climate-related changes in the ocean environment on the MCP, we found that three of the seven predicted changes could potentially enhance carbon sequestration by the MCP, and three could diminish it.

TI  - Oceanic iron fertilization: one of strategies for sequestration atmospheric CO2
AB  - Carbon cycle is connected with the most important environmental issue of Global Change. As one of the major carbon reservoirs, oceans play an important part in the carbon cycle. In recent years, iron seems to give us a good news that oceanic iron fertilization could stimulate biological productivity as CO2 sink of human-produced CO2. Oceanic iron fertilization experiments have verified that adding iron into high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) seawaters can increase phytoplankton production and export organic carbon, and hence increase carbon sink of anthropogenic CO2, to reduce global warming. In sixty days, the export organic carbon could reach 10 000 times for adding iron by model prediction and in situ experiment, i.e. the atmospheric CO2 uptake and inorganic carbon drawdown in upper seawaters also have the same magnitude. Therefore, oceanic iron fertilization is one of the strategies for increasing carbon sink of anthropogenic CO2. The paper is focused on the iron fertilization, especially in situ ocean iron experiments in order that the future research is more efficient.

TI  - Evolutionary temperature compensation of carbon fixation in marine phytoplankton
AB  - The efficiency of carbon sequestration by the biological pump could decline in the coming decades because respiration tends to increase more with temperature than photosynthesis. Despite these differences in the short-term temperature sensitivities of photosynthesis and respiration, it remains unknown whether the long-term impacts of global warming on metabolic rates of phytoplankton can be modulated by evolutionary adaptation. We found that respiration was consistently more temperature dependent than photosynthesis across 18 diverse marine phytoplankton, resulting in universal declines in the rate of carbon fixation with short-term increases in temperature. Long-term experimental evolution under high temperature reversed the short-term stimulation of metabolic rates, resulting in increased rates of carbon fixation. Our findings suggest that thermal adaptation may therefore have an ameliorating impact on the efficiency of phytoplankton as primary mediators of the biological carbon pump.

TI  - Effect of Intensity and Mode of Artificial Upwelling on Particle Flux and Carbon Export
AB  - Reduction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions alone will not sufficiently restrict global warming and enable the 1.5 degrees C goal of the Paris agreement to be met. To effectively counteract climate change, measures to actively remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere are required. Artificial upwelling has been proposed as one such carbon dioxide removal technique. By fueling primary productivity in the surface ocean with nutrient-rich deep water, it could potentially enhance downward fluxes of particulate organic carbon (POC) and carbon sequestration. In this study we investigated the effect of different intensities of artificial upwelling combined with two upwelling modes (recurring additions vs. one singular addition) on POC export, sinking matter stoichiometry and remineralization depth. We carried out a 39 day-long mesocosm experiment in the subtropical North Atlantic, where we fertilized oligotrophic surface waters with different amounts of deep water. The total nutrient inputs ranged from 1.6 to 11.0 mu mol NO3- L-1. We found that on the one hand POC export under artificial upwelling more than doubled, and the molar C:N ratios of sinking organic matter increased from values around Redfield (6.6) to similar to 8-13, which is beneficial for potential carbon dioxide removal. On the other hand, sinking matter was remineralized at faster rates and showed lower sinking velocities, which led to shallower remineralization depths. Particle properties were more favorable for deep carbon export in the recurring upwelling mode, while in the singular mode the C:N increase of sinking matter was more pronounced. In both upwelling modes roughly half of the produced organic carbon was retained in the water column until the end of the experiment. This suggests that the plankton communities were still in the process of adjustment, possibly due to the different response times of producers and consumers. There is thus a need for studies with longer experimental durations to quantify the responses of fully adjusted communities. Finally, our results revealed that artificial upwelling affects a variety of sinking particle properties, and that the intensity and mode with which it is applied control the strength of the effects.

TI  - Energy management and operational planning of an ecological engineering for carbon sequestration in coastal mariculture environments in China
AB  - China is now accelerating the development of an ecological engineering for carbon sequestration in coastal mariculture environments to cope with climate change. Artificial upwelling as the ecological engineering can mix surface water with bottom water and bring rich nutrients to the euphotic zone, enhance seaweed growth in the oligotrophic sea area, and then increase coastal carbon sequestration. However, one of the major obstacles of the artificial upwelling is the high energy consumption. This study focused on the development of energy management technology for air-lift artificial upwelling by optimizing air injection rate. The fundamental principle underlying this technology is that the mode and intensity of air injection are adjusted from the feedback of information on velocity variation in tidal currents, illumination, and temperature of the surface layer. A series of equations to control air injection was derived based on seaweed growth and solar power generation. Although this finding was originally developed for the air-lift artificial upwelling, it also can be used in other areas of engineering, such as water delivery, aeration, and oxygenation. The simulations show that using a variable air injection rate can lift more nitrogen nutrients of 28.2 mol than using a fixed air injection rate of 26.6 mol, mostly with the same energy cost. Using this control algorithm, the changed temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles prove the effective upwelling in the experiments and the average weights of kelp are 33.1 g in the experimental group and 10.1 g in the control group. The ecological engineering was successfully increasing crop yield for carbon sequestration in coastal mariculture environments. Â© 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Natural iron fertilization of the coastal ocean by ``blackwater rivers{''
AB  - The present study elucidates the role of natural iron fertilization of the coastal ocean by so-called ``blackwater rivers{''}. Areas of marsh, fen, peatland, boreal forest etc. are characterized by organic-rich soils. From those soils, humic substances (humic and fulvic acids) are leached to the aquatic system resulting in river water that is low in pH and dark-brown in color. The point is that ``blackwater rivers{''} tend to be rich in dissolved iron due to the unique chelating properties of humic and fulvic acids which bind Fe(III) and keep it in solution. We performed algal physiological (growth rate) experiments under conditions of iron deficiency with the marine unicellular phytoplankton algae Chlorella salina and Diacronema lutheri in 0.2 mu m cut-off filtered mixtures of natural ``blackwater river{''} water and synthetic seawater. Our results demonstrate that the iron naturally present in ``blackwater rivers{''} is readily bioavailable to bothmarine algal species. Further more, the humic and fulvic acids exert an additional stimulatory effect on the marine algae. Both algae thrive much better in the presence of natural humic and fulvic acids as compared to a mediumwhere EDTA is used as an iron-chelating agent. Our results indicate that ``blackwater rivers{''}, in sharp contrast to other types of rivers, are excellent sources of bioavailable iron to marine phytoplankton. This natural iron fertilization may give rise to photosynthesis-driven sequestration of CO2 from the atmosphere to the sea, as can be seen from the visualization of CO2 surface concentrations by NASA (NASA GEOS-5 model) which shows the global sources and sinks of CO2 localized in time and space. The results by NASA suggest that strong marine CO2 sinks in coastal waters tend to occur close to ``blackwater river{''} estuaries. It is thus evident that ``blackwater rivers{''} act as important sources of a limiting nutrient (iron) to the ocean. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Reviews and syntheses: Ocean iron fertilization experiments - past, present, and future looking to a future Korean Iron Fertilization Experiment in the Southern Ocean (KIFES) project
AB  - Since the start of the industrial revolution, human activities have caused a rapid increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, which have, in turn, had an impact on climate leading to global warming and ocean acidification. Various approaches have been proposed to reduce atmospheric CO2. The Martin (or iron) hypothesis suggests that ocean iron fertilization (OIF) could be an effective method for stimulating oceanic carbon sequestration through the biological pump in iron-limited, high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) regions. To test the Martin hypothesis, 13 artificial OIF (aOIF) experiments have been performed since 1990 in HNLC regions. These aOIF field experiments have demonstrated that primary production (PP) can be significantly enhanced by the artificial addition of iron. However, except in the Southern Ocean (SO) European Iron Fertilization Experiment (EIFEX), no significant change in the effectiveness of aOIF (i.e., the amount of iron-induced carbon export flux below the winter mixed layer depth, MLD) has been detected. These results, including possible side effects, have been debated amongst those who support and oppose aOIF experimentation, and many questions concerning the effectiveness of scientific aOIF, environmental side effects, and international aOIF law frameworks remain. In the context of increasing global and political concerns associated with climate change, it is valuable to examine the validity and usefulness of the aOIF experiments. Furthermore, it is logical to carry out such experiments because they allow one to study how plankton-based ecosystems work by providing insight into mechanisms operating in real time and under in situ conditions. To maximize the effectiveness of aOIF experiments under international aOIF regulations in the future, we therefore suggest a design that incorporates several components. (1) Experiments conducted in the center of an eddy structure when grazing pressure is low and silicate levels are high (e.g., in the SO south of the polar front during early summer) (2) Shipboard observations extending over a minimum of similar to 40 days, with multiple iron injections (at least two or three iron infusions of similar to 2000 kg with an interval of similar to 10-15 days to fertilize a patch of 300 km(2) and obtain a similar to 2 nM concentration). (3) Tracing of the iron-fertilized patch using both physical (e.g., a drifting buoy) and biogeochemical (e.g., sulfur hexafluoride, photosynthetic quantum efficiency, and partial pressure of CO2) tracers. (4) Employment of neutrally buoyant sediment traps (NBST) and application of the water-column-derived thorium-234 (Th-234) method at two depths (i.e., just below the in situ MLD and at the winter MLD), with autonomous profilers equipped with an underwater video profiler (UVP) and a transmissometer. (5) Monitoring of side effects on marine/ocean ecosystems, including production of climate-relevant gases (e.g., nitrous oxide, N2O; dimethyl sulfide, DMS; and halogenated volatile organic compounds, HVOCs), decline in oxygen inventory, and development of toxic algae blooms, with optical-sensor-equipped autonomous moored profilers and/or autonomous benthic vehicles. Lastly, we introduce the scientific aOIF experimental design guidelines for a future Korean Iron Fertilization Experiment in the Southern Ocean (KIFES).

TI  - The viscosity effect on marine particle flux: A climate relevant feedback mechanism
AB  - Oceanic uptake and long-term storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) are strongly driven by the marine "biological pump," i.e., sinking of biotically fixed inorganic carbon and nutrients from the surface into the deep ocean (Sarmiento and Bender,; Volk and Hoffert,). Sinking velocity of marine particles depends on seawater viscosity, which is strongly controlled by temperature (Sharqawy et al.,). Consequently, marine particle flux is accelerated as ocean temperatures increase under global warming (Bach et al.,). Here we show that this previously overlooked "viscosity effect" could have profound impacts on marine biogeochemical cycling and carbon uptake over the next centuries to millennia. In our global warming simulation, the viscosity effect accelerates particle sinking by up to 25%, thereby effectively reducing the portion of organic matter that is respired in the surface ocean. Accordingly, the biological carbon pump's efficiency increases, enhancing the sequestration of atmospheric CO2 into the ocean. This effect becomes particularly important on longer time scales when warming reaches the ocean interior. At the end of our simulation (4000 A.D.), oceanic carbon uptake is 17% higher, atmospheric CO2 concentration is 180 ppm lower, and the increase in global average surface temperature is 8% weaker when considering the viscosity effect. Consequently, the viscosity effect could act as a long-term negative feedback mechanism in the global climate system. Key Points Global warming reduces seawater viscosity, thus accelerating particle sinking Faster sinking enhances the biological pump and oceanic carbon uptake This "viscosity effect" is a previously overlooked climate feedback mechanism Â©2014.

TI  - Mesoscale ocean fronts enhance carbon export due to gravitational sinking and subduction
AB  - Enhanced vertical carbon transport (gravitational sinking and subduction) at mesoscale ocean fronts may explain the demonstrated imbalance of new production and sinking particle export in coastal upwelling ecosystems. Based on flux assessments from U-238:Th-234 disequilibrium and sediment traps, we found 2 to 3 times higher rates of gravitational particle export near a deep-water front (305 mg C.m(-2).d(-1)) compared with adjacent water or to mean (nonfrontal) regional conditions. Elevated particle flux at the front wasmechanistically linked to Fe-stressed diatoms and high-mesozooplankton fecal pellet production. Using a data assimilative regional ocean model fit to measured conditions, we estimate that an additional similar to 225 mg C.m(-2).d(-1) was exported as subduction of particle-rich water at the front, highlighting a transport mechanism that is not captured by sediment traps and is poorly quantified by most models and in situ measurements. Mesoscale fronts may be responsible for over a quarter of total organic carbon sequestration in the California Current and other coastal upwelling ecosystems.

TI  - Benthic Biodiversity, Carbon Storage and the Potential for Increasing Negative Feedbacks on Climate Change in Shallow Waters of the Antarctic Peninsula
AB  - Simple Summary Seafloor biodiversity provides a key ecosystem service, as an efficient route for carbon to be removed from the atmosphere to become buried (long-term) in marine sediment. Protecting near intact ecosystems, particularly those that are hotspots of biodiversity, with high numbers of unique species (endemics), is increasingly being recognised as the best route to protect existing blue carbon. This study measured globally significant stocks of blue carbon held within both rocky (17.5 tonnes carbon km(-2)) and soft (4.1 t C km(-2)) substrata shallow (20 m) seafloor communities along the Antarctic Peninsula. Along the 7998 km of seasonally ice-free shoreline, 59\% of known dive sites were classified as rocky and 12\% as soft substratum. This gave estimates of 253k t C in animals and plants found at 20 m depth, with a potential sequestration of 4.5k t C year(-1). More carbon was stored in assemblages with greater functional groups. Of the Antarctic Peninsula shore, 54\% is still permanently ice covered, and so blue carbon ecosystem services are expected to more than double with continued climate warming. As one of the few increasing negative feedbacks against climate change, protecting seafloor communities around the Antarctic is expected to help tackle both the biodiversity and climate crises. The importance of cold-water blue carbon as biological carbon pumps that sequester carbon into ocean sediments is now being realised. Most polar blue carbon research to date has focussed on deep water, yet the highest productivity is in the shallows. This study measured the functional biodiversity and carbon standing stock accumulated by shallow-water (<25 m) benthic assemblages on both hard and soft substrata on the Antarctic Peninsula (WAP, 67 degrees S). Soft substrata benthic assemblages (391 +/- 499 t C km(-2)) contained 60\% less carbon than hard substrata benthic assemblages (648 +/- 909). In situ observations of substrata by SCUBA divers provided estimates of 59\% hard (4700 km) and 12\% soft (960 km) substrata on seasonally ice-free shores of the Antarctic Peninsula, giving an estimate of 253,000 t C at 20 m depth, with a sequestration potential of \~{}4500 t C year(-1). Currently, 54\% of the shoreline is permanently ice covered and so climate-mediated ice loss along the Peninsula is predicted to more than double this carbon sink. The steep fjordic shorelines make these assemblages a globally important pathway to sequestration, acting as one of the few negative (mitigating) feedbacks to climate change. The proposed WAP marine protected area could safeguard this ecosystem service, helping to tackle the climate and biodiversity crises.

TI  - Southern Ocean deep-water carbon export enhanced by natural iron fertilization
AB  - The addition of iron to high- nutrient, low- chlorophyll regions induces phytoplankton blooms that take up carbon(1-3). Carbon export from the surface layer and, in particular, the ability of the ocean and sediments to sequester carbon for many years remains, however, poorly quantified(3). Here we report data from the CROZEX experiment(4) in the Southern Ocean, which was conducted to test the hypothesis that the observed north - south gradient in phytoplankton concentrations in the vicinity of the Crozet Islands is induced by natural iron fertilization that results in enhanced organic carbon flux to the deep ocean. We report annual particulate carbon fluxes out of the surface layer, at three kilometres below the ocean surface and to the ocean floor. We find that carbon fluxes from a highly productive, naturally iron-fertilized region of the sub- Antarctic Southern Ocean are two to three times larger than the carbon fluxes from an adjacent high-nutrient, low- chlorophyll area not fertilized by iron. Our findings support the hypothesis that increased iron supply to the glacial sub- Antarctic may have directly enhanced carbon export to the deep ocean(5). The CROZEX sequestration efficiency(6) ( the amount of carbon sequestered below the depth of winter mixing for a given iron supply) of 8,600 mol mol(-1) was 18 times greater than that of a phytoplankton bloom induced artificially by adding iron(7), but 77 times smaller than that of another bloom(8) initiated, like CROZEX, by a natural supply of iron. Large losses of purposefully added iron can explain the lower efficiency of the induced bloom(6). The discrepancy between the blooms naturally supplied with iron may result in part from an underestimate of horizontal iron supply.

TI  - Ocean iron fertilization: Why further research is needed
AB  - Despite large uncertainties in the fertilization efficiency, natural iron fertilization studies and some of the purposeful iron enrichment studies have demonstrated that Southern Ocean iron fertilization can lead to a significant export of carbon from the sea surface to the ocean interior. From an economic perspective the potential of ocean iron fertilization (OIF) is far from negligible in relation to other abatement options. Comparing the range of cost estimates to the range of estimates for forestation projects they are in the same order of magnitude, but OIF could provide more carbon credits even if high discount rates are used to account for potential leakage and non-permanence. However, the uncertainty about undesired adverse effects of purposeful iron fertilization on marine ecosystems and biogeochemistry has led to attempts to ban commercial and, to some extent, scientific experiments aimed at a better understanding of the processes involved, effectively precluding further consideration of this mitigation option. As regards the perspective of public international law, the pertinent agreements dealing with the protection of the marine environment indicate that OIF is to be considered as lawful if and to the extent to which it represents legitimate scientific research. In this respect, the precautionary principle can be used to balance the risks arising out of scientific OIF activities for the marine environment with the potential advantages relevant to the objectives of the climate change regime. As scientific OIF experiments involve only comparatively small negative impacts within a limited marine area, further scientific research must be permitted to explore the carbon sequestration potential of OIF in order to either reject this concept or integrate it into the flexible mechanisms contained in the Kyoto Protocol.

TI  - Global negative emissions capacity of ocean macronutrient fertilization
AB  - In order to meet the goal of limiting global average temperature increase to less than 2 degrees C, it is increasingly apparent that negative emissions technologies of up to 10 Pg C yr(-1) will be needed before the end of the century. Recent research indicates that fertilization of the ocean with the macronutrients nitrogen and phosphorus where they limit primary production, may have sequestration advantages over fertilizing iron limited regions. Utilizing global datasets of oceanographic field measurements, and output from a high resolution global circulation model, the current study provides the first comprehensive assessment of the global potential for carbon sequestration from ocean macronutrient fertilization (OMF). Sufficient excess phosphate exists outside the iron limited surface ocean to support once-off sequestration of up to 3.6 Pg C by fertilization with nitrogen. Ongoing maximum capacity of nitrogen only fertilization is estimated at 0.7 +/- 0.4 Pg C yr(-1) . Sequestration capacity is expected to decrease from the upper toward the lower bound over time under continued intense fertilization. If N and P were used in combination the capacity is ultimately limited by societies willingness to utilize phosphate resources. Doubling current phosphate production would allow an additional 0.9 Pg C yr(-1) and consume 0.07\% yr(-1) of known global resources. Therefore offsetting up to around 15\% (1.5 Pg C yr(-1)) of annual global CO2 emissions is assessed as being technically plausible. Environmental risks which to date have received little quantitative evaluation, could also limit the scale of implementation. These results reinforce the need to consider a multi-faceted approach to greenhouse gasses, including a reduction in emissions coupled with further research into negative emissions technologies.

TI  - Carbon footprint â€“ an environmental sustainability indicator of large scale CO2sequestration
AB  - To slow down the degeneration of the planetary life support system atmospheric CO2concentration must be reduced. There are no insignificant CO2emissions since all CO2ends-up in a single atmosphere of finite size. To minimize anthropogenic CO2emissions and to bring its atmospheric concentration to 320 ppm, the world economies should replace fossil fuels with alternative energy sources and construct large facilities for reduction of atmospheric CO2. Environmental indicators (EIs) gauge the burden of goods and services on the environment. The carbon footprint (CF) is the EI of greenhouse gas emissions and is measured in terms of CO2equivalent. This chapter brings preliminary estimation of CFs for the following CO2reduction technologies: Photosynthetic or microalgae CO2sequestration (MCS), artificial photosynthesis (AP), ocean iron fertilization (OIF), oceanic CO2sequestration (OCS), and terrestrial CO2sequestration (TCS). OIF, OCS, and TCS should not be considered when constructing the large facilities for reduction of atmospheric CO2because each of these technologies could easily become a source of greenhouse gases. The large facilities for reduction of atmospheric CO2should rely on MCS and AP technologies and reforestation. Â© Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.

TI  - Economic prospects of ocean iron fertilization in an international carbon market
AB  - Staying within the 2Â° C temperature increase target for climate change requires for ambitious emission reduction targets for the 2012-2020 compliance period. Cost-efficiency is a crucial criterion for the achievement of such targets, requiring analyses of all possible options. Enhancing the oceanic carbon sink via ocean iron fertilization (OIF) provides such an option. Our analysis reveals that the critical unit costs per net ton of CO 2 sequestered by OIF range from 22 to 28 USD (price level 2000) in a post-Kyoto compliance scenario. The critical unit costs are defined as those that would make an emitter indifferent between various abatement options. With reference to hypothetical short-term large-scale Southern Ocean OIF we are able to show that seven years of OIF provide a number of credits exceeding those obtainable from global forestation projects lasting 20 years. From an economic perspective, our results indicate that OIF can be considered a potentially viable carbon-removal option. However, further research is needed, especially on adverse side-effects and their ecological and economical consequences. Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Role of the ocean in climate stabilization
AB  - The ocean has absorbed over 90% of the heat from recent anthropogenic greenhouse warming. This chapter reviews a variety of ocean-related methods for slowing down and eventually halting this warming. â€œBlue carbonâ€ reservoirs store more carbon than terrestrial equivalents, although are still limited compared with global negative emissions needs. Oceanic carbon uptake could be augmented via iron fertilization, although this method presents challenges. Algal-based biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (ABECCS) offers opportunities for carbon-neutral fuel alternatives as well as for negative emissions. Total carbon dioxide removal potential is estimated at 15-33 Pg CO2/year by mid-century and 33-95 Pg CO2/year by the end of the century, which could offset current and projected CO2 emissions. ABECCS can also coproduce high-protein feed for aquaculture and reduce demand for agricultural land. Combined with effective ocean blue carbon management and terrestrial methods, ocean-based carbon removal can play a critical role in climate stabilization. Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Biological or microbial carbon pump? The role of phytoplankton stoichiometry in ocean carbon sequestration
AB  - Once fixed by photosynthesis carbon becomes part of the marine food web. The fate of this carbon has two possible outcomes, it may be respired and released back to the ocean and potentially to the atmosphere as CO2 or retained in the ocean interior and/or marine sediments for extended time scales. The most important biologically mediated processes responsible for long-term carbon storage in the ocean are the biological carbon pump (BCP) and the microbial carbon pump (MCP). While acting simultaneously in the ocean, the balance between these two mechanisms is thought to vary depending on the trophic state of the environment. Using previously published formulations, we propose a modelling framework to simulate variability in the MCP:BCP ratio as a function of external nutrients. Our results suggest that the role of the MCP might become more significant under future climate change conditions where increased stratification enhances the oligotrophic nature of the surface ocean. Based on these model results, we propose a conceptual framework in which the internal stoichiometry of phytoplankton, modulating both grazing pressure and dissolved organic matter production (via phytoplankton exudation), plays a crucial role in regulating the MCP:BCP ratio.

TI  - Achieving Highly Efficient Atmospheric CO2 Uptake by Artificial Upwelling
AB  - Artificial upwelling (AU) is considered a potential means of reducing the accumulation of anthropogenic CO2. It has been suggested that AU has significant effects on regional carbon sink or source characteristics, and these effects are strongly influenced by certain technical parameters, the applied region, and the season. In this study, we simulated the power needed to raise the level of deep ocean water (DOW) to designated plume trapping depths in order to evaluate the effect of changing the source DOW depth and the plume trapping depth on carbon sequestration ability and efficiency. A carbon sequestration efficiency index (CSEI) was defined to indicate the carbon sequestration efficiency per unit of power consumption. The results suggested that the CSEI and the carbon sequestration ability exhibit opposite patterns when the DOW depth is increased, indicating that, although raising a lower DOW level can enhance the regional carbon sequestration ability, it is not energy-efficient. Large variations in the CSEI were shown to be associated with different regions, seasons, and AU technical parameters. According to the simulated CSEI values, the northeast past of the Sea of Japan is most suitable for AU, and some regions in the South China Sea are not suitable for increasing carbon sink.

TI  - Integrating functional diversity, food web processes, and biogeochemical carbon fluxes into a conceptual approach for modeling the upper ocean in a high-CO2 world
AB  - [}1] Marine food webs influence climate by channeling carbon below the permanent pycnocline, where it can be sequestered. Because most of the organic matter exported from the euphotic zone is remineralized within the ``upper ocean'' (i.e., the water column above the depth of sequestration), the resulting CO2 would potentially return to the atmosphere on decadal timescales. Thus ocean-climate models must consider the cycling of carbon within and from the upper ocean down to the depth of sequestration, instead of only to the base of the euphotic zone. Climate-related changes in the upper ocean will influence the diversity and functioning of plankton functional types. In order to predict the interactions between the changing climate and the ocean's biology, relevant models must take into account the roles of functional biodiversity and pelagic ecosystem functioning in determining the biogeochemical fluxes of carbon. We propose the development of a class of models that consider the interactions, in the upper ocean, of functional types of plankton organisms ( e. g., phytoplankton, heterotrophic bacteria, microzooplankton, large zooplankton, and microphagous macrozooplankton), food web processes that affect organic matter ( e. g., synthesis, transformation, and remineralization), and biogeochemical carbon fluxes ( e. g., photosynthesis, calcification, respiration, and deep transfer). Herein we develop a framework for this class of models, and we use it to make preliminary predictions for the upper ocean in a high-CO2 world, without and with iron fertilization. Finally, we suggest a general approach for implementing our proposed class of models.

TI  - Enhanced chemical weathering as a geoengineering strategy to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide, supply nutrients, and mitigate ocean acidification
AB  - Chemical weathering is an integral part of both the rock and carbon cycles and is being affected by changes in land use, particularly as a result of agricultural practices such as tilling, mineral fertilization, or liming to adjust soil pH. These human activities have already altered the terrestrial chemical cycles and land-ocean flux of major elements, although the extent remains difficult to quantify. When deployed on a grand scale, Enhanced Weathering (a form of mineral fertilization), the application of finely ground minerals over the land surface, could be used to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. The release of cations during the dissolution of such silicate minerals would convert dissolved CO2 to bicarbonate, increasing the alkalinity and pH of natural waters. Some products of mineral dissolution would precipitate in soils or be taken up by ecosystems, but a significant portion would be transported to the coastal zone and the open ocean, where the increase in alkalinity would partially counteract "ocean acidification" associated with the current marked increase in atmospheric CO2. Other elements released during this mineral dissolution, like Si, P, or K, could stimulate biological productivity, further helping to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. On land, the terrestrial carbon pool would likely increase in response to Enhanced Weathering in areas where ecosystem growth rates are currently limited by one of the nutrients that would be released during mineral dissolution. In the ocean, the biological carbon pumps (which export organic matter and CaCO3 to the deep ocean) may be altered by the resulting influx of nutrients and alkalinity to the ocean. This review merges current interdisciplinary knowledge about Enhanced Weathering, the processes involved, and the applicability as well as some of the consequences and risks of applying the method.

TI  - Carbon Dioxide Concentration Mechanisms in Natural Populations of Marine Diatoms: Insights From Tara Oceans
AB  - Marine diatoms, the most successful photoautotrophs in the ocean, efficiently sequester a significant part of atmospheric CO2 to the ocean interior through their participation in the biological carbon pump. However, it is poorly understood how marine diatoms fix such a considerable amount of CO2, which is vital information toward modeling their response to future CO2 levels. The Tara Oceans expeditions generated molecular data coupled with in situ biogeochemical measurements across the main ocean regions, and thus provides a framework to compare diatom genetic and transcriptional flexibility under natural CO2 variability. The current study investigates the interlink between the environmental variability of CO2 and other physicochemical parameters with the gene and transcript copy numbers of five key enzymes of diatom CO2 concentration mechanisms (CCMs): Rubisco activase and carbonic anhydrase (CA) as part of the physical pathway, together with phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and malic enzyme as part of the potential C4 biochemical pathway. Toward this aim, we mined >200 metagenomes and >220 metatranscriptomes generated from samples of the surface layer of 66 globally distributed sampling sites and corresponding to the four main size fractions in which diatoms can be found: 0.8-5 mu m, 5-20 mu m, 20-180 mu m, and 180-2,000 mu m. Our analyses revealed that the transcripts for the enzymes of the putative C4 biochemical CCM did not in general display co-occurring profiles. The transcripts for CAs were the most abundant, with an order of magnitude higher values than the other enzymes, thus implying the importance of physical CCMs in diatom natural communities. Among the different classes of this enzyme, the most prevalent was the recently characterized iota class. Consequently, very little information is available from natural diatom assemblages about the distribution of this class. Biogeographic distributions for all the enzymes show different abundance hotspots according to the size fraction, pointing to the influence of cell size and aggregation in CCMs. Environmental correlations showed a complex pattern of responses to CO2 levels, total phytoplankton biomass, temperature, and nutrient concentrations. In conclusion, we propose that biophysical CCMs are prevalent in natural diatom communities.

TI  - The importance of the dissolved organic matter pool for the carbon sequestration potential of artificial upwelling
AB  - In the face of climate change there is a need to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Artificial upwelling of nutrient-rich deep waters has been proposed as a method to enhance the biological carbon pump in oligotrophic oceanic regions in order to increase carbon sequestration. Here we examine the effect of different artificial upwelling intensities and modes (single pulse versus recurring pulses) on the dynamics of the dissolved organic matter pool (DOM). We introduced nutrient-rich deep water to large scale mesocosms (similar to 44 m(3)) in the oligotrophic subtropical North Atlantic and found that artificial upwelling strongly increased DOM concentrations and changed its characteristics. The magnitude of the observed changes was related to the upwelling intensity: more intense treatments led to higher accumulation of dissolved organic carbon (>70 mu M of excess DOC over ambient waters for the most intense) and to comparatively stronger changes in DOM characteristics (increased proportions of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) and humic-like fluorescent DOM), suggesting a transformation of the DOM pool at the molecular level. Moreover, the single upwelling pulse resulted in higher CDOM quantities with higher molecular weight than the recurring upwelling mode. Together, our results indicate that under artificial upwelling, large DOM pools may accumulate in the surface ocean without being remineralized in the short-term. Possible reasons for this persistence could be a combination of the molecular diversification of DOM due to microbial reworking, nutrient limitation and reduced metabolic capabilities of the prokaryotic communities within the mesocosms. Our study demonstrates the importance of the DOC pool when assessing the carbon sequestration potential of artificial upwelling.

TI  - A microscopic simulation of particle flux in ocean waters: Application to radioactive pair disequilibrium
AB  - The biological carbon pump, a fundamental component of the global carbon cycle, is a mechanism comprised of biological processes that transfer large amounts of organic carbon from the upper ocean to the ocean's interior. It sequesters CO2 for weeks to hundreds or even millions of years through the sinking of a complex mix of biogeo-chemical material. As particles sink the flux of particulate organic carbon attenuates and only a fraction of the flux reaches the ocean's depth. Quantifying the attenuation of sinking particulate carbon flux is key to assess the amount of carbon sequestered in the twilight zone. Current knowledge of the particle flux attenuation relies on a reduced number of direct measurements, usually fitted to a power law, that tries to describe the result of a large variety of biological, physical and chemical processes involved. We present a stochastic simulation for particle production, sinking and degradation in the oceans that includes most of the essential ingredients to ultimately describe the sinking carbon flux in the ocean and where all the complex biogeochemical behavior is captured by macroscopic parameters. The algorithm proposed interprets these phenomena probabilistically and is an ideal framework to describe the observed patterns of particle flux attenuation in depth. Particles are randomly produced and degraded with depth-dependent functions, which reproduces the variability of these processes in nature. Hence, the simulation proposed provides a suitable approach to analyse sinking carbon when different particle sizes or speeds are used. Furthermore, production and degradation phenomena are time-dependent, this way their seasonal evolution can be additionally explored and the simulation results in an ideal test-bed for the assessment of both steady and non-steady state situations. In addition, the theoretical formulation proposed provides a simple frame to include particle-metals interactions through adsorption and desorption processes. In this paper we relate typical parametrizations of the flux attenuation curve to their corresponding degradation rate and propose an alternative parametrization to model the flux degradation function which is negligible at very large depths, therefore producing a constant residual flux, and remains finite in the euphotic zone. This degradation function is implemented in the simulation and applied to estimate the scavenging of the naturally occurring radioisotopes Th-234 and Po-210. We use the results to estimate effective adsorption and desorption rate constants for both isotopes. We found that the degradation rate, rather than the half-life, controls the depth at which the parent and daughter reach equilibrium. Thus, this depth is ruled by a combination of the degradation rate and the particle sinking velocity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The export and fate of organicmatter in the ocean: New constraints from combining satellite and oceanographic tracer observations
AB  - The ocean's biological pump transfers carbon from the surface euphotic zone into the deep ocean, reducing the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Despite its climatic importance, there are large uncertainties in basic metrics of the biological pump. Previous estimates of the strength of the biological pump, as measured by the amount of organic carbon exported from the euphotic zone, range from about 4 to 12 Pg C yr(-1). The fate of exported carbon, in terms of how efficiently it is transferred into the deep ocean, is even more uncertain. Here we present a new model of the biological pump that assimilates satellite and oceanographic tracer observations to constrain rates and patterns of organic matter production, export, and remineralization in the ocean. The data-assimilated model predicts a global particulate organic carbon (POC) flux out of the euphotic zone of similar to 9 Pg C yr(-1). The particle export ratio (the ratio of POC export to net primary production) is highest at high latitudes and lowest at low latitudes, but low-latitude export is greater than predicted by previous models, in better agreement with observed patterns of long-term carbon export. Particle transfer efficiency (T-eff) through the mesopelagic zone is controlled by temperature and oxygen, with highest T-eff for high-latitude regions and oxygen minimum zones. In contrast, T-eff in the deep ocean (below 1000 m) is controlled by particle sinking speed, with highest deep ocean T-eff below the subtropical gyres. These results emphasize the utility of both remote sensing and oceanographic tracer observations for constraining the operation of the biological pump. Plain Language Summary Tiny marine plants known as phytoplankton absorb vast amounts of carbon, a portion of which settles into the deep ocean as the remains of dead organisms, where it is ultimately decomposed. This ``biological carbon pump{''} is a key component of the global carbon cycle, bringing almost as much CO2 into the subsurface ocean on an annual basis as humans emit through fossil fuel burning. In this work, we present a new way to estimate how efficiently the biological pump is moving carbon from the surface to deep ocean and what factors determine the efficiency of the biological pump. By combining observations from Earth-orbiting satellites and from seagoing research cruises in a global carbon cycle model, we show that the low-latitude ocean exports more carbon out of the surface ocean than previously thought. We also show that temperature and oxygen concentrations are the most important controls on how efficiently carbon is transferred into the deep ocean. This has important implications for how the biological pump will respond to climate change, which is expected to lead to a warmer and less oxygenated ocean.

TI  - Jelly biomass sinking speed reveals a fast carbon export mechanism
AB  - Sinking of gelatinous zooplankton biomass is an important component of the biological pump removing carbon from the upper ocean. The export efficiency, e.g., how much biomass reaches the ocean interior sequestering carbon, is poorly known because of the absence of reliable sinking speed data. We measured sinking rates of gelatinous particulate organic matter (jelly-POM) from different species of scyphozoans, ctenophores, thaliaceans, and pteropods, both in the field and in the laboratory in vertical columns filled with seawater using high-quality video. Using these data, we determined taxon-specific jelly-POM export efficiencies using equations that integrate biomass decay rate, seawater temperature, and sinking speed. Two depth scenarios in several environments were considered, with jelly-POM sinking from 200 and 600 m in temperate, tropical, and polar regions. Jelly-POM sank on average between 850 and 1500 m d(-1) (salps: 800-1200 m d(-1); ctenophores: 1200-1500 m d(-1); scyphozoans: 1000-1100 m d(-1); pyrosomes: 1300 m d(-1)). High latitudes represent a fast-sinking and low-remineralization corridor, regardless of species. In tropical and temperate regions, significant decomposition takes place above 1500 m unless jelly-POM sinks below the permanent thermocline. Sinking jelly-POM sequesters carbon to the deep ocean faster than anticipated, and should be incorporated into biogeochemical and modeling studies to provide more realistic quantification of export via the biological carbon pump worldwide.

TI  - Climate engineering by artificial ocean upwelling: Channelling the sorcerer's apprentice
AB  - Recent suggestions to reduce the accumulation of anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have included ocean fertilization by artificial upwelling. Our coupled carbon-climate model simulations suggest that artificial upwelling may, under most optimistic assumptions, be able to sequester atmospheric CO2 at a rate of about 0.9 PgC/yr. However, the model predicts that about 80% of the carbon sequestered is stored on land, as a result of reduced respiration at lower air temperatures brought about by upwelling of cold waters. This remote and distributed carbon sequestration would make monitoring and verification particularly challenging. A second caveat predicted by our simulations is that whenever artificial upwelling is stopped, simulated surface temperatures and atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise quickly and for decades to centuries to levels even somewhat higher than experienced in a world that never engaged in artificial upwelling.

TI  - Expected Limits on the Potential for Carbon Dioxide Removal From Artificial Upwelling
AB  - Artificial upwelling, the engineered upward pumping of deep ocean water, has long been proposed as a technique to fertilize the ocean and, more recently, remove atmospheric carbon dioxide. This study investigated the potential of artificial upwelling to contribute to carbon dioxide removal using a simple model with high-resolution (1Â° Ã— 1Â°) gridded monthly climatologies of upper ocean and deep ocean physical and chemical properties. The potential for carbon dioxide removal was explored across a range of observationally-informed carbon-to-nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios for microalgae and macroalgae communities, providing information on the sensitivity of the estimates to any assumed carbon-to-nutrient ratios. Simulated carbon dioxide removal across the tropical-to-subpolar ocean did not exceed 0.66 tons per square kilometer per year for microalgae, and did not exceed 0.85 tons per square kilometer per year for macroalgae. Using current technology, the estimated global aggregate potential for carbon dioxide removal using microalgae was less than 50 megatons (0.05 gigatons) of carbon dioxide annually and the estimated global aggregate potential for carbon dioxide removal using macroalgae was approximately 100 megatons (0.1 gigatons) of carbon dioxide annually. While controlled field trials are needed to validate or invalidate the findings of this study, this study suggests that artificial upwelling is unlikely to support annual carbon dioxide removal at, or close to, the rate of one gigaton of carbon dioxide annually.

TI  - Increasing Oceanic Carbon Fixation Through Fe Fertilization: Opportunity for Mine Water?
AB  - Approximately 30 \% of the Earth's oceans support low rates of primary production because of low Fe concentrations. The fertilization of these waters with Fe has been proposed as a tool for creating phytoplankton blooms, increasing carbon fixation, and sequestering carbon in deep ocean waters. This paper reviews the status of the ocean iron fertilization (OIF) concept and assesses the opportunity it may provide to mining companies and mine water professionals who regularly deal with large quantities of Fe. Using data produced by large OIF experiments, calculations are provided regarding the efficiency of Fe additions for carbon fixation and the quantities of Fe that would be needed if OIF became an accepted practice. The gross value of Fe used in OIF projects is calculated from the current value of carbon credits and salmon and tuna fisheries. If the OIF concept advances, the huge demand for Fe that will be created may justify reconsideration of mine water treatment practices that produce more pure Fe solids than is the case with conventional treatment technologies.

TI  - Ocean Fertilization Science, Policy, and Commerce
AB  - Over the past 20 years there has been growing interest in the concept of fertilizing the ocean with iron to abate global warming. This interest was catalyzed by basic scientific experiments showing that iron limits primary production in certain regions of the ocean. The approach-considered a form of ``geoengineering{''}-is to induce phytoplankton blooms through iron addition, with the goal of producing organic particles that sink to the deep ocean, sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. With the controversy surrounding the most recent scientific iron fertilization experiment in the Southern Ocean (LOHAFEX) and the ongoing discussion about restrictions on large-scale iron fertilization activities by the London Convention, the debate about the potential use of iron fertilization for geoengineering has never been more public or more pronounced. To help inform this debate, we present a synoptic view of the two-decade history of iron fertilization, from scientific experiments to commercial enterprises designed to trade credits for ocean fertilization on a developing carbon market. Throughout these two decades there has been a repeated cycle: Scientific experiments are followed by media and commercial interest and this triggers calls for caution and the need for more experiments. Over the years, some scientists have repeatedly pointed out that the idea is both unproven and potentially ecologically disruptive, and models have consistently shown that at the limit, the approach could not substantially change the trajectory of global warming. Yet, interest and investment in ocean fertilization as a climate mitigation strategy have only grown and intensified, fueling media reports that have misconstrued scientific results, and conflated scientific experimentation with geoengineering. We suggest that it is time to break this two-decade cycle, and argue that we know enough about ocean fertilization to say that it should not be considered further as a means to mitigate climate change. But, ocean fertilization research should not be halted: if used appropriately and applied to testable hypotheses, it is a powerful research tool for understanding the responses of ocean ecosystems in the context of climate change.

TI  - Climate intervention: Carbon dioxide removal and reliable sequestration
AB  - The signals are everywhere that our planet is experiencing significant climate change. It is clear that we need to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from our atmosphere if we want to avoid greatly increased risk of damage from climate change. Aggressively pursuing a program of emissions abatement or mitigation will show results over a timescale of many decades. How do we actively remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to make a bigger difference more quickly? As one of a two-book report, this volume of Climate Intervention discusses CDR, the carbon dioxide removal of greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere and sequestration of it in perpetuity. Climate Intervention: Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reliable Sequestration introduces possible CDR approaches and then discusses them in depth. Land management practices, such as low-till agriculture, reforestation and afforestation, ocean iron fertilization, and land-and-ocean-based accelerated weathering, could amplify the rates of processes that are already occurring as part of the natural carbon cycle. Other CDR approaches, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration, direct air capture and sequestration, and traditional carbon capture and sequestration, seek to capture CO2 from the atmosphere and dispose of it by pumping it underground at high pressure. This book looks at the pros and cons of these options and estimates possible rates of removal and total amounts that might be removed via these methods. With whatever portfolio of technologies the transition is achieved, eliminating the carbon dioxide emissions from the global energy and transportation systems will pose an enormous technical, economic, and social challenge that will likely take decades of concerted effort to achieve. Climate Intervention: Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reliable Sequestration will help to better understand the potential cost and performance of CDR strategies to inform debate and decision making as we work to stabilize and reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide.

TI  - How deep is deep enough? Ocean iron fertilization and carbon sequestration in the Southern Ocean
AB  - Artificial ocean iron fertilization (OIF) enhances phytoplankton productivity and is being explored as a means of sequestering anthropogenic carbon within the deep ocean. To be considered successful, carbon should be exported from the surface ocean and isolated from the atmosphere for an extended period (e.g., the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's standard 100 year time horizon). This study assesses the impact of deep circulation on carbon sequestered by OIF in the Southern Ocean, a high-nutrient low-chlorophyll region known to be iron stressed. A Lagrangian particle-tracking approach is employed to analyze water mass trajectories over a 100 year simulation. By the end of the experiment, for a sequestration depth of 1000 m, 66% of the carbon had been reexposed to the atmosphere, taking an average of 37.8 years. Upwelling occurs predominately within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current due to Ekman suction and topography these results emphasize that successful OIF is dependent on the physical circulation, as well as the biogeochemistry. Key Points Carbon export to 1000 m does not guarantee sequestration in the Southern Ocean OIF requires consideration of the circulation as well as biogeochemistry Sequestered carbon is dispersed widely out of the Southern Ocean by circulation Â© 2014.

TI  - Marine planktonic ecosystem dynamics in an artificial upwelling area of Japan: Phytoplankton production and biomass fate
AB  - Marine phytoplankton production as well as biomass is globally significant. This study hypothesized that a mild increase in nutrients concentrations (by a factor 1â€“2 higher) from artificial upwelling in oligotrophic water can alter phytoplankton dynamics (biomass, composition and size), and consequently, phytoplankton-derived particulate organic carbon flux. Primary production, carbon biomass of different planktonic groups, and organic carbon remineralization were examined by incubating seawater collected from two oceanographic stations in the vicinities of Ikitsuki Island, Japan, in 2004 and 2005. Station C, located near to and downstream of an artificial seamount that generates upwelling, had higher nutrient concentrations and biomass (Chl. a and carbon) than Station O-2, which was upstream and far from the seamount. Phytoplankton biomass and primary production rates remained higher during incubation for station C than for station O-2 in both 2004 and 2005. Phytoplankton composition also differed between the two stations. Picophytoplankton contributions to total biomass were smaller at station C than at station O-2 while those of micro- and nanophytoplankton were higher at station C. The results of this study indicate that even a small increase in nutrient availability in oligotrophic waters can alter productivity, biomass, and phytoplankton composition. Additionally, around 4.0% of net primary production was estimated to escape from grazers and remineralization, instead sinking into deep ocean layers in the form of less easily degraded particles. The difference in net primary productivity between Stns. C and O-2 gave an estimation of excess production at Stn. C resulting from upwelled nutrients. Owing to this 1.3 to 1.5 mg more carbon mâˆ’ 2 dâˆ’ 1 is likely to be exported at Stn. C compared to Stn. O-2. Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Nutrient composition (Si:N) as driver of plankton communities during artificial upwelling
AB  - Artificial upwelling brings nutrient-rich deep water to the sun-lit surface to boost fisheries or carbon sequestration. Deep water sources under consideration range widely in inorganic silicon (Si) relative to nitrogen (N). Yet, little is known about how such differences in nutrient composition may influence the effectiveness of the fertilization. Si is essential primarily for diatoms that may increase food web and export efficiency via their large size and ballasting mineral shells, respectively. With a month-long mesocosm study in the subtropical North Atlantic, we tested the biological response to artificial upwelling with varying Si:N ratios (0.07-1.33). Community biomass increased 10-fold across all mesocosms, indicating that basic bloom dynamics were upheld despite the wide range in nutrient composition. Key properties of these blooms, however, were influenced by Si. Photosynthetic capacity and nutrient-use efficiency doubled from Si-poor to Si-rich upwelling, leading to C:N ratios as high as 17, well beyond Redfield. Si-rich upwelling also resulted in 6-fold higher diatom abundance and mineralized Si and a corresponding shift from smaller towards larger phytoplankton. The pronounced change in both plankton quantity (biomass) and quality (C:N ratio, size and mineral ballast) for trophic transfer and export underlines the pivotal role of Si in shaping the response of oligotrophic regions to upwelled nutrients. Our findings indicate a benefit of active Si management during artificial upwelling with the potential to optimize fisheries production and CO2 removal.

TI  - Understanding the remote influences of ocean weather on the episodic pulses of particulate organic carbon flux
AB  - The biological carbon pump has been estimated to export similar to 5-15 Gt C yr(-1) into the deep ocean, and forms the principal deep-sea food resource. Irregular, intense pulses of particulate organic carbon (POC) have been found to make up about one-third of the overall POC fluxes at a long-term deep-sea research station influenced by coastal upwelling of the California Current, Station M (34 degrees 50/N, 123 degrees W, 4000 m depth). However, the drivers of these pulses have been challenging to quantify. It has long been recognized that ocean currents can result in particles being advected while sinking to the point of collection by a sediment trap. Thus, a sediment trap time series can incorporate material from a dynamic catchment area, a concept sometimes referred to as a statistical funnel. This concept raises many questions including: what are the day-to-day conditions at the source locations of the sinking POC? And, how might such `ocean weather' and related ecosystem factors influence the intense variation seen at the seafloor? Here we analyzed three-dimensional ocean currents from a Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) model from 2011 to 2017 to trace the potential source locations of particles sinking at 1000, 100, and 50 m d(-1) from an export depth of 100 m. We then used regionally tailored satellite data products to estimate export flux of POC from these locations. For the 100 m d(-1) speed, the particles had origins of up to similar to 300 km horizontal distance from the sediment trap location, moored at Station M at 3400 m depth., and nearly 1000 km for the 50 m speed. Particle tracking indicated that, there was considerable inter-annual variation in source locations. Particle source locations tended to originate from the east in the summer months, with higher export and POC fluxes. Occasionally these locations were in the vicinity of highly productive ocean features nearer to the coast. We found significant correlations between export flux of organic carbon from the estimated source locations at 100 m depth to trap-estimated POC fluxes at 3400 m depth. These results set the stage for further investigation into sinking speed distributions, conditions at the source locations, and comparisons with mechanistic biogeochemical models and between particle tracking model frameworks.

TI  - Phytoplankton Distributions in the Kuroshio-Oyashio Region of the Northwest Pacific Ocean: Implications for Marine Ecology and Carbon Cycle
AB  - The Northwest Pacific Ocean (NWPO) is a significant sink for atmospheric CO2 but a paucity of large-scale phytoplankton surveys in the upper and lower euphotic zone results in uncertainties in estimates of the efficiency of the biological carbon pump there. Here, we report the spatial distribution of lipid biomarkers from diatoms (brassicasterol/epi-brassicasterol), dinoflagellates (dinosterol), and haptophytes (C-37 alkenones) as proxies of phytoplankton biomass and community structure in suspended particles from the surface and deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) layers across low- and mid-latitude regions of the NWPO. Our observations suggest that these lipid biomarkers can be used as indicators of the vertical distributions of phytoplankton biomass, which was comparable between the surface and DCM layers. Water masses with different nutrient concentrations strongly controlled the variations of lipid biomarkers, showing high biomass and the dominance of diatoms in the eutrophic Oyashio region, whereas low biomass and high proportions of dinoflagellates and haptophytes occurred in the oligotrophic Kuroshio region. Diatoms predominated in the DCM, likely enhancing carbon sequestration in the deep ocean and in sediments. Our results quantitatively demonstrate the horizontal and vertical variations of phytoplankton biomass and community structure, leading to an improved understanding of ecosystem function and biogeochemical cycles in this important region of the NWPO.

TI  - Enhanced ocean carbon storage from anaerobic alkalinity generation in coastal sediments
AB  - The coastal ocean is a crucial link between land, the open ocean and the atmosphere. The shallowness of the water column permits close interactions between the sedimentary, aquatic and atmospheric compartments, which otherwise are decoupled at long time scales (congruent to 1000 yr) in the open oceans. Despite the prominent role of the coastal oceans in absorbing atmospheric CO2 and transferring it into the deep oceans via the continental shelf pump, the underlying mechanisms remain only partly understood. Evaluating observations from the North Sea, a NW European shelf sea, we provide evidence that anaerobic degradation of organic matter, fuelled from land and ocean, generates total alkalinity (AT) and increases the CO2 buffer capacity of seawater. At both the basin wide and annual scales anaerobic AT generation in the North Sea's tidal mud flat area irreversibly facilitates 7-10\%, or taking into consideration benthic denitrification in the North Sea, 20-25\% of the North Sea's overall CO2 uptake. At the global scale, anaerobic AT generation could be accountable for as much as 60\% of the uptake of CO2 in shelf and marginal seas, making this process, the anaerobic pump, a key player in the biological carbon pump. Under future high CO2 conditions oceanic CO2 storage via the anaerobic pump may even gain further relevance because of stimulated ocean productivity.

TI  - Deep Water Nutrient Supply for an Offshore Ulva sp. Cultivation Project in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea: Experimental Simulation and Modeling
AB  - Offshore cultivation of marine macroalgae is a potential sustainable resource for fuel, food, and chemicals. Offshore, the high productivity of macroalgae cultivation depends on external nitrogen supply. The current work examines the idea of supplying nitrogen for Ulva sp. cultivation in the oligotrophic Eastern Mediterranean Sea (EMS) by artificial upwelling of nutrient-rich deep seawater (DSW). Growth rates, protein, and starch contents of Ulva sp. were measured for time varying fertilizations with nitrate concentrations corresponding to nutrient concentrations of DSW at increasing depths of the EMS. A maximal relative growth rate of 7.4% was measured for fertilizing ten times per week with 5.8Â Î¼M, which corresponds to the artificial upwelling from the depth of 700Â m at EMS. Protein and starch contents ranged between 1â€“6 and 8â€“15% of dry weight. Finally, yields and energetic costs of DSW pumping were modeled for an example case of 10-ha offshore farm. The model predicts a high productivity but low energetic efficiency, which can be improved by coupling the biomass production with offshore power sources such as ocean thermal energy conversion.

TI  - Biogenic Iron Dust: A Novel Approach to Ocean Iron Fertilization as a Means of Large Scale Removal of Carbon Dioxide From the Atmosphere
AB  - This is a proposal for ocean iron fertilization as a means to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. The idea is to take advantage of nanoparticulate, poorly crystalline Fe-oxides produced by chemosynthetic iron-oxidizing bacteria as an iron source to the ocean. Upon drying these oxides produce a fine powder that could be dispersed at altitude by aircraft to augment wind-driven Aeolian dust that is a primary iron source to the open ocean. Based on Fe-oxidation rates for natural populations of iron-oxidizing bacteria it is estimated 1,500 hectares of production ponds (1 x 100 x 100 m) would be required to produce sufficient iron dust to supply the 30\% of the global ocean that is iron-limited. In theory, iron replete conditions will stimulate the biological pump to quantitatively remove enough carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to partially mitigate anthropogenic inputs. Modifications to existing technologies would satisfy most of the technological challenges. Addition of biogenic iron to meso-scale eddies could provide an effective means of testing this process. Nonetheless, there are many unknowns, thus any such effort will require research and development integrated across oceanographic and Earth science disciplines to determine its long term efficacy.

TI  - Possibilities of increasing marine biological productivity by artificial upwelling
AB  - An increase in biological productivity within defined sea areas may be achieved by creating an artificial rise to the surface (artificial upwelling) of bottom water rich in biological material. Powered by the wave energy in the Black Sea the experimental systems designed by the authors could raise water via pipes from below the thermocline layer from a depth of 200 m. The upwelled water differed appreciably from that in the surface layers. The concentration of nutrients was many times greater than that in the surface water and contributed greatly to an intensive growth of phytoplankton and to an increase in biomass. Prospects for the use of artificial upwelling systems based on sea wave energy are discussed not only with regard to increasing biological productivity of water but also for overcoming a number of other problems.

TI  - On the Southern Ocean CO2 uptake and the role of the biological carbon pump in the 21st century
AB  - We use a suite of eight ocean biogeochemical/ecological general circulation models from the Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 archives to explore the relative roles of changes in winds (positive trend of Southern Annular Mode, SAM) and in warming- and freshening-driven trends of upper ocean stratification in altering export production and CO2 uptake in the Southern Ocean at the end of the 21st century. The investigated models simulate a broad range of responses to climate change, with no agreement on a dominance of either the SAM or the warming signal south of 44 degrees S. In the southernmost zone, i.e., south of 58 degrees S, they concur on an increase of biological export production, while between 44 and 58 degrees S the models lack consensus on the sign of change in export. Yet in both regions, the models show an enhanced CO2 uptake during spring and summer. This is due to a larger CO2(aq) drawdown by the same amount of summer export production at a higher Revelle factor at the end of the 21st century. This strongly increases the importance of the biological carbon pump in the entire Southern Ocean. In the temperate zone, between 30 and 44 degrees S, all models show a predominance of the warming signal and a nutrient-driven reduction of export production. As a consequence, the share of the regions south of 44 degrees S to the total uptake of the Southern Ocean south of 30 degrees S is projected to increase at the end of the 21st century from 47 to 66\% with a commensurable decrease to the north. Despite this major reorganization of the meridional distribution of the major regions of uptake, the total uptake increases largely in line with the rising atmospheric CO2. Simulations with the MITgcm-REcoM2 model show that this is mostly driven by the strong increase of atmospheric CO2, with the climate-driven changes of natural CO2 exchange offsetting that trend only to a limited degree (approximate to 10\%) and with negligible impact of climate effects on anthropogenic CO2 uptake when integrated over a full annual cycle south of 30 degrees S.

TI  - Results from real sea experiment of ocean nutrient enhancer Takumi
AB  - Upwelling and scattering Deep Ocean Water (DOW) into the euphoric surface layer has been proposed by many oceanographers as a "fishing ground of artificial upwelling". So far, however, there are no successful means to make it, because of the following difficulties; the very huge amount of DOW upwelling, the dilution of DOW's nutrient salts in the sea, enduring the rough sea condition on offshore, the strength of very long riser pipe for upwelling, etc. The MARINO-FORUM 21, sponsored by Japanese government fisheries agency, organized the research and development project of an ocean nutrient enhancer named TAKUMI and real sea experiment using it, since the year of 2000. New technology concept, featuring the density current generator for avoiding dilution of nutrient salts, the spar type submersible floating structure for withstanding against the rough sea condition, and the design and analysis of riser pipe for not only in case of the rough sea but also in case of the upending which is world first challenge of election of steel riser pipe with gravity fall in the sub-sea, was studied and introduced for the design of TAKUMI as a proper Ocean Nutrient Enhancer. TAKUMI that upwells DOW of 100,000m3/day from 200m depth and discharges it into the euphoric layer with Diesel engine was manufactured and set-up at the center of Sagami Bay in Japan, in May 2003. More than five years continuous operation in various sea conditions, which includes very rough sea in typhoon and rapid current, caused by direction change of Kuroshio Current was carried out. Also, the behavior of the nutrient water mass and the pattern of primary production around TAKUMI was investigated using the research vessel Tansei Maru. The results from the real sea experiment lead us to believe that the TAKUMI type artificial DOW upwelling system can be feasible to increase a primary production and make a fishing ground in case of large size system of more than 1,000,000m3/day..

AB  - Accurate estimation of particulate organic carbon (POC) export efficiency in the euphotic layer is essential to understand the efficiency of the ocean's biological carbon pump, but field measurements are difficult to conduct and data are sparse. In this study, we investigated the relationship between POC sinking export efficiency and ocean net primary production (NPP) in the euphotic layer of the northern South China Sea (NSCS), with the help of high spatiotemporal coverage satellite-derived NPP. Annual mean POC export efficiency in euphotic zone is 34% for the shelf areas and 24% for the basin of the NSCS in the context of satellite-derived 16-day-composited NPP. Similar to what is generally observed in the global ocean, the POC export efficiency on the shelf areas appears to be strengthened with the increase of NPP. However, in the basin areas, the opposite relationship is observed. That is, the POC export efficiency significantly decreases with the increase of NPP. Seasonal decoupling between NPP and POC export, phytoplankton size structure, grazing by zooplankton, and dissolved organic carbon export might account for the observed negative relationship between the POC export efficiency and NPP in the euphotic layer of basin region. System comparison between shelf and basin would be helpful to promote understanding of the regulation mechanism of POC export in the tropical marginal seas. Â© 2018 by the authors.

TI  - Artificial upwelling and near-field mixing of deep-ocean water effluent
AB  - Deep-ocean water (DOW) at a depth of 300 m or lower is cold, nutrient-rich, and free of pathogenic bacteria. This water is considered an important natural resource. One of the fully developed technologies of DOW application is ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), which makes use of DOW for energy production. In recent years, the potential of DOW to enrich the open oceans and thus to increase fish yield has attracted the attention of researchers. Before this potential can be realized, however, major scientific and technological developments concerning artificial upwelling, plume mixing, and DOW stimulated bio-productivity must be achieved. This study, which is a continuation of earlier research on artificial upwelling at the University of Hawaii, investigates the effects of discharging artificially upwelled DOW into the open ocean where it is subsequently mixed with surface water. The study involves both hydraulic modeling and numerical simulation, and its objective is to control the near-field mixing of DOW effluent such that the dilution is small and the settling depth does not go below the euphotic zone. Special attention is given to wave effects on the near-field mixing processes. Research results indicate that, with proper effluent control, desirable nutrient-rich DOW plumes can be established and maintained in the open ocean.

TI  - The production of food, energy and fresh water from the sea through Artificial Upwelling
AB  - The tropical oceans are the world's largest collector and storage system of solar energy. This heat can be utilized to generate mechanical energy and fresh water by using the cold deep water, only about 1000 m below this vast heat reservoir as the heat sink. After its utilization in the condenser of the power generating or desalination plant, the deep water can be utilized in a mariculture system to produce plant and animal protein. In a small shore-based pilot plant on the north shore of St. Croix, U. S. Virgin Islands, the technical feasibility of Artificial Upwelling mariculture has been demonstrated. Its economic potential is now under evaluation. The plant protein yield per unit surface area achieved in St. Croix is 8.1 tons/hectare/year. At current market prices, the gross sales value of the meat which can be obtained from a given volume of deep sea water pumped to the surface is considerably greater than that of the energy which can be generated from the same volume of deep water, according to OTEC power systems presently under consideration in the United States. The combined utilization of the AT and the nutrient content of deep water in the tropical ocean could be economical and would contribute to solving current shortages of food and energy.

TI  - Consensus, Certainty, and Catastrophe: Discourse, Governance, and Ocean Iron Fertilization
AB  - States, transnational networks of scientists, corporate actors, and institutions in the climate change regime have known for decades that iron ore, when dumped in the ocean, can stimulate the growth of plankton. Over the past twenty years, normative disagreements about appropriate behavior have shaped international governance of the phenomenon. Prior to 2007, firms lobbied governments to treat the oceans as a carbon sink and to allow corporations that dumped iron to sell carbon credits on the international market. However, after 2007 a transnational coalition of oceanographers and advocates opposed this agenda by linking it to an emergent antigeoengineering discourse. Crucial to their efforts was their interpretation of uncertainty: for opponents, scientific uncertainty implied possibly devastating consequences of iron dumping, which was thus best addressed with extreme caution. This normative approach ultimately shaped governance, since advocates successfully used it to lobby institutions in ocean governance to prevent carbon credits from being issued for ocean fertilization. Since these subjective understandings of certainty influenced global ocean governance, this article explains international behavior as a consequence of changing norms.

TI  - Influence of diatom diversity on the ocean biological carbon pump
AB  - Diatoms sustain the marine food web and contribute to the export of carbon from the surface ocean to depth. They account for about 40\% of marine primary productivity and particulate carbon exported to depth as part of the biological pump. Diatoms have long been known to be abundant in turbulent, nutrient-rich waters, but observations and simulations indicate that they are dominant also in meso- and submesoscale structures such as fronts and filaments, and in the deep chlorophyll maximum. Diatoms vary widely in size, morphology and elemental composition, all of which control the quality, quantity and sinking speed of biogenic matter to depth. In particular, their silica shells provide ballast to marine snow and faecal pellets, and can help transport carbon to both the mesopelagic layer and deep ocean. Herein we show that the extent to which diatoms contribute to the export of carbon varies by diatom type, with carbon transfer modulated by the Si/C ratio of diatom cells, the thickness of the shells and their life strategies; for instance, the tendency to form aggregates or resting spores. Model simulations project a decline in the contribution of diatoms to primary production everywhere outside of the Southern Ocean. We argue that we need to understand changes in diatom diversity, life cycle and plankton interactions in a warmer and more acidic ocean in much more detail to fully assess any changes in their contribution to the biological pump.

TI  - Time of Emergence and Large Ensemble Intercomparison for Ocean Biogeochemical Trends
AB  - Anthropogenically forced changes in ocean biogeochemistry are underway and critical for the ocean carbon sink and marine habitat. Detecting such changes in ocean biogeochemistry will require quantification of the magnitude of the change (anthropogenic signal) and the natural variability inherent to the climate system (noise). Here we use Large Ensemble (LE) experiments from four Earth system models (ESMs) with multiple emissions scenarios to estimate Time of Emergence (ToE) and partition projection uncertainty for anthropogenic signals in five biogeochemically important upper-ocean variables. We find ToEs are robust across ESMs for sea surface temperature and the invasion of anthropogenic carbon; emergence time scales are 20-30 yr. For the biological carbon pump, and sea surface chlorophyll and salinity, emergence time scales are longer (50+ yr), less robust across the ESMs, and more sensitive to the forcing scenario considered. We find internal variability uncertainty, and model differences in the internal variability uncertainty, can be consequential sources of uncertainty for projecting regional changes in ocean biogeochemistry over the coming decades. In combining structural, scenario, and internal variability uncertainty, this study represents the most comprehensive characterization of biogeochemical emergence time scales and uncertainty to date. Our findings delineate critical spatial and duration requirements for marine observing systems to robustly detect anthropogenic change.

TI  - Concept for a wave driven, mechanical artificial upwelling device (MAUD)
AB  - In this paper the authors (two mechanical engineers and one biologist) present the concept of a wave driven Mechanical Artificial Upwelling Device (MAUD-1) to pump deep ocean waters into surface layers and mix it there, thus increasing plankton production and leading ultimately to CO2 binding, fish stock enhancement, shore protection and water temperature control. The article describes some of the existing upwelling devices. It outlines the technical principle and gives a conservative performance simulation of MAUD-1. The biological background is presented and the conditions for promising MAUD-1 testing areas are developed. The authors whish to stimulate the discussion among the research community, to increase the interest and chances for the realisation of a first MAUD-1 project in the near future.

TI  - Biogeochemical Equilibrium Responses to Maximal Productivity in High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll Regions
AB  - Whether ocean iron fertilization in high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) regions is a practical geoengineering strategy to combat climate warming has been debated because the fate of absorbed carbon by the ocean remains unclear. We use an optimized oceanic biogeochemical inverse model to explore the equilibrium responses to increased productivity in major HNLC regions. We find that an overall downward shift of nutrients and carbon from the surface and intermediate to the deep waters with maximal productivity in the HNLC Southern Ocean (SO), North Pacific (NP) and eastern equatorial Pacific (EP). The efficiency of soft tissue pump is increased by 37.8\%, 2.7\% and 5.4\% in the SO, EP and NP simulation while atmospheric CO2 concentration is drawn down by 45.1, 3.4 and 6.7 ppm, respectively. Meanwhile, global mean oxygen is decreased by 21.1\%, 1.3\% and 2.4\% in the SO, EP and NP simulation, accompanied by an expansion of oxygen minimum zones by 400\%, 26\% and 63\%, respectively. Our study indicates that iron fertilization has the potential to be an effective geoengineering approach to mitigate climate warming but also has a strong impact on the development of ocean hypoxia.

TI  - Organic matter production response to CO2 increase in open subarctic plankton communities: Comparison of six microcosm experiments under iron-limited and -enriched bloom conditions
AB  - Increase in seawater pCO2 and the corresponding decrease in pH caused by the increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration (i.e., ocean acidification) may affect organic matter production by phytoplankton communities. Organic matter production forms the basis of marine food webs and plays a crucial role in oceanic CO2 uptake through the biological carbon pump, and hence will potentially affect future marine ecosystem dynamics. However, responses of organic matter production in open ocean plankton ecosystems to CO2 increase have not been fully examined. We conducted on-deck microcosm experiments using high nutrient, low chlorophyll (HNLC) waters in the western subarctic Pacific and oceanic Bering Sea basin in summer 2008 and 2009, respectively, to examine the impacts of elevated CO2 on particulate and dissolved organic matter (i.e., POM and DOM, respectively) production. Iron deficient natural plankton communities were incubated for 7-14 days under multiple CO2 levels with and without iron enrichments (hereafter +Fe and -Fe treatments, respectively). By combining with our previous experiments at two sites, we created a comprehensive dataset on responses of organic matter production to CO2 increase during macronutrient replete conditions in HNLC waters. Significant differences in net particulate organic carbon production among CO2 treatments were observed only in the -Fe treatments, whereas that in net dissolved organic carbon production were mainly observed in the +Fe treatments, suggesting that CO2 may affect different processes depending on the Fe nutritional status. However, impacts of CO2 were not consistent among experiments and were much smaller than the consistent positive effects of Fe enrichment. In contrast, no significant differences among the CO2 treatments were observed for organic carbon partitioning into POM and DOM, and carbon to nitrogen ratio of net produced POM. We conclude that CO2 does not play a primary role, but could have secondary effects on controlling the organic matter production under macronutrient replete conditions in HNLC waters. On the other hand, in a nutrient-depleted, declining phase of the phytoplankton bloom induced by Fe enrichment, carbon overconsumption was found in an experiment with elevated CO2 conditions suggesting that CO2 impacts might become more significant in such environments.

TI  - Iron sources alter the response of Southern Ocean phytoplankton to ocean acidification
AB  - The projected rise in anthropogenic CO2 and associated ocean acidification (OA) will change trace metal solubility and speciation, potentially altering Southern Ocean (SO) phyto-plankton productivity and species composition. As iron (Fe) sources are important determinants of Fe bioavailability, we assessed the effect of Fe-laden dust versus inorganic Fe (FeCl3) enrichment under ambient and high pCO(2) levels (390 and 900 mu atm) in a naturally Fe-limited SO phytoplankton community. Despite similar Fe chemical speciation and net particulate organic carbon (POC) production rates, CO2-dependent species shifts were controlled by Fe sources. Final phytoplankton communities of both control and dust treatments were dominated by the same species, with an OA-dependent shift from the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia prolongatoides towards the prymnesiophyte Phaeocystis antarctica. Addition of FeCl3 resulted in high abundances of Nitzschia lecointei and Chaetoceros neogracilis under ambient and high pCO(2), respectively. These findings reveal that both the characterization of the phytoplankton community at the species level and the use of natural Fe sources are essential for a realistic projection of the biological carbon pump in the Fe-limited pelagic SO under OA. As dust deposition represents a more realistic scenario for the Fe-limited pelagic SO under OA, unaffected net POC production and dominance of P. antarctica can potentially weaken the export of carbon and silica in the future.

TI  - Effects of operating parameters and injection method on the performance of an artificial upwelling by using airlift pump
AB  - Artificial upwelling by using airlift pump is considered a sustainable way in actualizing ocean fertilization, which could potentially alleviate the pressures on the fish stocks and human-driven climate change. However, few experimental data about the effects of operating parameters and injection method on the performance of the airlift artificial upwelling were found in the literature. In this paper, an airlift pump for artificial upwelling was investigated through three field experiments, in which airlift pumps of pipe length ranges from 20 to 28.3 m and pipe diameter ranges from 0.4 to 2 m, were designed and tested. Pumped water flow rate and injected air flow rate were measured to study the effects of different factors on the performance of airlift pump. The experiment results show that airlift pump efficiency is closely related to pipe diameter, submerged depth, submergence ratio and nozzle designs. There is no best nozzle for all the range of air flow rate, and the recommended nozzles are double-ring-shaped or star-shaped nozzles when the air flow rate is less or more than 220 L/min, respectively. Moreover, the lift effectiveness increases when the hole size of nozzle is enlarged, which indicates a relatively large bubble size will enhance the lift effectiveness.

TI  - Cross-Shore Flow and Implications for Carbon Export in the California Current Ecosystem: A Lagrangian Analysis
AB  - Eastern Boundary Current Upwelling Systems are regions of elevated primary production and carbon export and thus play a central role in the global carbon cycle. In these regions, nutrient upwelling occurs in a narrow region close to the coast, but primary production and carbon export are typically observed across a broader region. The fact that productive waters reach the open ocean has important consequences for the biological carbon pump, because such transport connects nutrient sources close to the coast to the deep carbon sinks of the offshore ocean. However, many aspects of this offshore transport are still not known. Here we address seasonal and interannual variability of upwelling-related cross-shore flows in the California current ecosystem (CCE) by employing Lagrangian diagnostics of horizontal transport inferred from satellite data. We define an advective age as the time a water parcel flowed offshore of the 500 m isobath. We find that the offshore extension of high Chl-a waters covaries with the age of a coastal water parcel, and is consistent with mesoscale circulation. Interannual variability in the offshore extent of older waters is primarily driven by mesoscale variability and covaries with large scale forcing by both ENSO and the NPGO. The measured ratio of in-situ new production: carbon export also covaries with water age, and tends to be 1 in younger and more balanced in older waters. Our results may help to parameterize the role of the finescale on the export of carbon in upwelling regions for climate resolving models. Plain Language Summary The California current ecosystem (CCE) is a region of strong coastal upwelling, elevated organic matter production and high carbon flux into the deep ocean, and potentially influential in the global carbon cycle. Previous studies have suggested that production and sinking are not balanced in the CCE: there is more production than sinking close to the coast and more sinking than production offshore. Our study uses satellite measurements to analyze cross-shore flows in the CCE and assess whether horizontal transport of water, nutrients, and plankton can reconcile this spatial imbalance. By following water parcel trajectories, we find that the time since a water parcel is transported from the coast to the offshore is a predictor of whether the water parcel is a net source of organic matter (greater new production than sinking) or a net sink (greater sinking than new production). We find that the offshore distance of water transport varies strongly from year to year and is related to known sources of climate forcing, including El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation. Future organic matter exchanges between the coast and the offshore can be estimated thanks to covariability with these climate indices.

TI  - Autonomous Observations of the Ocean Biological Carbon Pump
AB  - Prediction of the substantial biologically mediated carbon flows in a rapidly changing and acidifying ocean requires model simulations informed by observations of key carbon cycle processes on the appropriate spatial and temporal scales. From 2000 to 2004, the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP) supported the development of the first low-cost, fully autonomous ocean profiling Carbon Explorers, which demonstrated that year-round, real-time observations of particulate organic carbon (POC) concentration and sedimentation could be achieved in the world's ocean. NOPP also initiated the development of a particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) sensor suitable for operational deployment across all oceanographic platforms. As a result, PIC profile characterization that once required shipboard sample collection and shipboard or shore-based laboratory analysis is now possible to full ocean depth in real time using a 0.2-W sensor operating at 24 Hz. NOPP developments further spawned US Department of Energy support to develop the Carbon Flux Explorer, a free vehicle capable of following hourly variations of PIC and POC sedimentation from the near surface to kilometer depths for seasons to years and capable of relaying contemporaneous observations via satellite. We have demonstrated the feasibility of real-time, low-cost carbon observations that are of fundamental value to carbon prediction and that, when further developed, will lead to a fully enhanced global carbon observatory capable of real-time assessment of the ocean carbon sink, a needed constraint for assessment of carbon management policies on a global scale.

TI  - Estimates of the effect of Southern Ocean iron fertilization on atmospheric CO2 concentrations
AB  - IT has been suggested1-3 that fertilizing the ocean with iron might offset the continuing increase in atmospheric CO2 by enhancing the biological uptake of carbon, thereby decreasing the surface-ocean partial pressure of CO2and drawing down CO2 from the atmosphere. Using a box model, we present estimates of the maximum possible effect of iron fertilization, assuming that iron is continuously added to the phosphate-rich waters of the Southern Ocean, which corresponds to 16% of the world ocean surface. We find that after 100 years of fertilization, the atmospheric CO2 concentration would be 59 p.p.m. below what it would have been with no fertilization, assuming no anthropogenic CO2 emissions, and 90-107 p.p.m. less when anthropogenic emissions are included in the calculation. Such a large uptake of CO2 is unlikely to be achieved in practice, owing to a variety of constraints that require further study; the effect of iron fertilization on the ecology of the Southern Ocean also remains to be evaluated. Thus, the most effective and reliable strategy for reducing future increases in atmospheric CO2 continues to be control of anthropogenic emissions. Â© 1991 Nature Publishing Group.

TI  - A nature-based negative emissions technology able to remove atmospheric methane and other greenhouse gases
AB  - Fulfilling the Paris Climate Agreement requires reducing rapidly the new emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to reach net zero by 2050. As some anthropogenic emissions cannot be zero, to compensate them it will be necessary to remove GHGs from the atmosphere. Among possible methods, the Iron Salt Aerosol (ISA) offers new possibilities, including removal of methane and several other GHGs, as well as carbon dioxide. Several studies suggest that anthropogenic emissions of iron participate in the current primary productivity. As plans to decarbonize the world economy might also have inadvertent warming effects due to the reduction of iron emissions from fossil fuels burning, iron additions might help address this issue. ISA is different from the method known as Ocean Iron Fertilization and the differences are explained. ISA mimic natural processes and the dust which probably participated in the cooling during the ice-ages over the past million years. Still larger laboratory trials, safety and environmental impact studies and global chemical computer modeling are necessary before ISA would be ready to be trialed. Desk and laboratory studies indicate low cost, easy deployment and efficacy, all of which can be validated by future small scale field trials, a step needed before, if successful, a possible implementation at a climate-relevant scale.

TI  - Physiological and biochemical responses of Thalassiosira weissflogii (diatom) to seawater acidification and alkalization
AB  - Increasing atmospheric pCO(2) leads to seawater acidification, which has attracted considerable attention due to its potential impact on the marine biological carbon pump and function of marine ecosystems. Alternatively, phytoplankton cells living in coastal waters might experience increased pH/decreased pCO(2) (seawater alkalization) caused by metabolic activities of other photoautotrophs, or after microalgal blooms. Here we grew Thalassiosira weissflogii (diatom) at seven pCO(2) levels, including habitat-related lowered levels (25, 50, 100, and 200 mu atm) as well as present-day (400 mu atm) and elevated (800 and 1600 mu atm) levels. Effects of seawater acidification and alkalization on growth, photosynthesis, dark respiration, cell geometry, and biogenic silica content of T. weissflogii were investigated. Elevated pCO(2) and associated seawater acidification had no detectable effects. However, the lowered pCO(2) levels (25 similar to 100 mu atm), which might be experienced by coastal diatoms in post-bloom scenarios, significantly limited growth and photosynthesis of this species. In addition, seawater alkalization resulted in more silicified cells with higher dark respiration rates. Thus, a negative correlation of biogenic silica content and growth rate was evident over the pCO(2) range tested here. Taken together, seawater alkalization, rather than acidification, could have stronger effects on the ballasting efficiency and carbon export of T. weissflogii.

TI  - Increased CO2 and iron availability effects on carbon assimilation and calcification on the formation of Emiliania huxleyi blooms in a coastal phytoplankton community
AB  - In the present work, we exposed a natural phytoplankton community to either present (390-mu atm, LC) or future CO2 levels predicted for year-2100 (900-mu atm, HC) combined with ambient (4.5 mnol L-1,-DFB) or high (12 nmol L-1, + DFB) dissolved iron (dFe) levels, during 25 days by using mesocosms. We report on changes in carbon assimilation processes (acquisition, fixation, and calcification) of the phytoplankton community due to increased dissolved CO2 and dFe and to the interaction of both factors. The isotopic disequilibrium assay results showed that inorganic carbon (C-i) acquisition by the community was unaffected by CO2 and Fe availability. The main C-i source for photosynthesis was HCO3- and external carbonic anhydrase activity was only detected at the beginning of the experiment, suggesting a relevant role for HCO3- transporters in the phytoplankton community developed in all treatments. However, there was a significant effect of both factors on particulate organic carbon (POC) content, particulate calcium production and carbon fixation rates. Increased dFe at LC conditions led to the highest values of carbon fixation and POC of all treatments, promoting a massive Emiliania huxleyi bloom. This response was not observed in the HC treatments. The latter indicates a negative impact of increased CO2 on the formation of E. huxleyi blooms, in agreement with the observed significant reduction in calcium production under HC. Our results suggest that ocean acidification can decrease primary production under iron-replete conditions in E. huxleyi blooming areas, affecting the biological carbon pump in coastal ecosystems.

TI  - Research progress in artificial upwelling and its potential environmental effects
AB  - Artificial upwelling, as a geoengineering tool, has received worldwide attention because it may actualize ocean fertilization in a sustainable way, which could potentially alleviate the pressures on the fish stocks and human-driven climate change in the ocean. We reviewed the current knowledge on the development of an artificial upwelling system and its potential environmental effects. Special attention was given to the research progress on the air-lift concept artificial upwelling by Zhejiang University. The research on artificial upwelling over the past few decades has generated a range of devices that have been successfully applied in the field for months. Based on field experiments and the associated modeling results, part of them reported positive effects on increasing primary production and enhancing CO2 sequestration. However, as a significant disturbance to the environment, especially for large-scale applications, the uncertainties related to the potential effects on ecosystem remain unsolved. Zhejiang University has overcome the technical challenges in designing and fabricating a robust and high efficiency artificial upwelling device which has been examined in two field experiments in Qiandao Lake and one sea trial in the East China Sea. It was investigated that cold and hypoxic deep ocean water (DOW) could be uplifted to the euphotic layer, which could potentially change the nutrient distribution and adjust the N/P ratio. Both simulation and field experiments results confirmed that utilizing self-powered energy to inject compressed air to uplift DOW was a valid and efficient method. Therefore, further field-based research on artificial upwelling, especially for long-term field research is required to test the scientific hypothesis.

TI  - Impact of atmospheric and terrestrial CO2 feedbacks on fertilization-induced marine carbon uptake
AB  - The sensitivity of oceanic CO2 uptake to alterations in the marine biological carbon pump, such as brought about by natural or purposeful ocean fertilization, has repeatedly been investigated by studies employing numerical biogeochemical ocean models. It is shown here that the results of such ocean-centered studies are very sensitive to the assumption made about the response of the carbon reservoirs on the atmospheric side of the sea surface. Assumptions made include prescribed atmospheric pCO(2), an interactive atmospheric CO2 pool exchanging carbon with the ocean but not with the terrestrial biosphere, and an interactive atmosphere that exchanges carbon with both oceanic and terrestrial carbon pools. The impact of these assumptions on simulated annual to millennial oceanic carbon uptake is investigated for a hypothetical increase in the C:N ratio of the biological pump and for an idealized enhancement of phytoplankton growth. Compared to simulations with interactive atmosphere, using prescribed atmospheric pCO(2) overestimates the sensitivity of the oceanic CO2 uptake to changes in the biological pump, by about 2\%, 25\%, 100\%, and >500\% on annual, decadal, centennial, and millennial timescales, respectively. The smaller efficiency of the oceanic carbon uptake under an interactive atmosphere is due to the back flux of CO2 that occurs when atmospheric CO2 is reduced. Adding an interactive terrestrial carbon pool to the atmosphere-ocean model system has a small effect on annual timescales, but increases the simulated fertilization-induced oceanic carbon uptake by about 4\%, 50\%, and 100\% on decadal, centennial, and millennial timescales, respectively, for pCO(2) sensitivities of the terrestrial carbon storage in the middle range of the C4MIP models (Friedlingstein et al., 2006). For such sensitivities, a substantial fraction of oceanic carbon uptake induced by natural or purposeful ocean fertilization originates, on timescales longer than decades, not from the atmosphere but from the terrestrial biosphere.

TI  - High-Frequency Variability of Small-Particle Carbon Export Flux in the Northeast Atlantic
AB  - The biological carbon pump exports carbon fixed by photosynthesis out of the surface ocean and transfers it to the deep, mostly in the form of sinking particles. Despite the importance of the pump in regulating the air-sea CO2 balance, the magnitude of global carbon export remains unclear, as do its controlling mechanisms. A possible sinking flux of carbon to the mesopelagic zone may be via the mixed-layer pump: a seasonal net detrainment of particulate organic carbon (POC)-rich surface waters, caused by sequential deepening and shoaling of the mixed layer. In this study, we present a full year of daily small-particle POC concentrations derived from glider optical backscatter data, to study export variability at the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (PAP) sustained observatory in the Northeast Atlantic. We observe a strong seasonality in small-particle transfer efficiency, with a maximum in winter and early spring. By calculating daily POC export driven by mixed-layer variations, we find that the mixed-layer pump supplies an annual flux of at least 3.0 +/- 0.9 g POC.m(-2).year(-1) to the mesopelagic zone, contributing between 5\% and 25\% of the total annual export flux and likely contributing to closing a gap in the mesopelagic carbon budget found by other studies. These are, to our best knowledge, the first high-frequency observations of export variability over the course of a full year. Our results support the deployment of bio-optical sensors on gliders to improve our understanding of the ocean carbon cycle on temporal scales from daily to annual.

TI  - Response of bacterioplankton to iron fertilization of the Southern Ocean, Antarctica
AB  - Ocean iron fertilization is an approach to increase CO2 sequestration. The Ingo-German iron fertilization experiment ``LOHAFEX{''} was carried out in the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica in 2009 to monitor changes in bacterial community structure following iron fertilization-induced phytoplankton bloom of the seawater from different depths. 16S rRNA gene libraries were constructed using metagenomic DNA from seawater prior to and after iron fertilization and the clones were sequenced for identification of the major bacterial groups present and for phylogenetic analyses. A total of 4439 clones of 16S rRNA genes from ten 16S rRNA gene libraries were sequenced. More than 97.35\% of the sequences represented four bacterial lineages i.e. Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes and confirmed their role in scavenging of phytoplankton blooms induced following iron fertilization. The present study demonstrates the response of Firmicutes due to Iron fertilization which was not observed in previous southern ocean Iron fertilization studies. In addition, this study identifies three unique phylogenetic clusters LOHAFEX Cluster 1 (affiliated to Bacteroidetes), 2, and 3 (affiliated to Firmicutes) which were not detected in any of the earlier studies on iron fertilization. The relative abundance of these clusters in response to iron fertilization was different. The increase in abundance of LOHAFEX Cluster 2 and Papillibacter sp. another dominant Firmicutes may imply a role in phytoplankton degradation. Disappearance of LOHAFEX Cluster 3 and other bacterial genera after iron fertilization may imply conditions not conducive for their survival. It is hypothesized that heterotrophic bacterial abundance in the Southern Ocean would depend on their ability to utilize algal exudates, decaying algal biomass and other nutrients thus resulting in a dynamic bacterial succession of distinct genera.

TI  - Retrospective satellite ocean color analysis of purposeful and natural ocean iron fertilization
AB  - Significant effort has been invested in understanding the role of iron in marine ecosystems over the past few decades. What began as shipboard amendment experiments quickly grew into a succession of in situ, mesoscale ocean iron fertilization (OIF) experiments carried out in all three high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) regions of the world ocean. Dedicated process studies have also looked at regions of the ocean that are seasonally exposed to iron-replete conditions as natural OIF experiments. However, one problem common to many OIF experiments is determination of biological response beyond the duration of the experiment (typically < 1 month). Satellite-derived products have been used to address this shortcoming with some success, but thus far, have been limited snapshots of a single parameter, chlorophyll. Here, we investigate phytoplankton responses to OIF in both purposeful and naturally iron enriched systems using estimates of chlorophyll (Chl), phytoplanIcton carbon biomass (C-phyto), their ratio (Chl:C-phyto) and two fluorescence indices, fluorescence per unit chlorophyll (FLH:Chl) and the chlorophyll fluorescence efficiency (phi(f)). These quantities allow partitioning of the biological response to OIF into that due to changes in biomass and that due to phytoplankton physiology. We find that relative increases in Chl (similar to 10-20x) following OIF far exceed increases in C-phyto < 4-5x), suggesting that a significant fraction of the observed Chl increase is associated with physiological adjustment to increased growth rates, photoacclimation, and floristic shifts in the phytoplankton community. Further, a consistent pattern of decreased satellite fluorescence efficiency (FLH:Chl or phi(f)) following OIF is observed that is in agreement with current understanding of phytoplankton physiological responses to relief from iron stress. The current study extends our ability to retrieve phytoplankton physiology from space-based sensors, strengthens the link between satellite fluorescence and iron availability, and shows that satellite ocean color analyses provide a unique tool for monitoring OIF experiments.

TI  - The Potential of Ocean Iron Fertilization as an Option for Mitigating Climate Change
AB  - Ocean iron fertilization is currently being discussed as one measure that could contribute to climate change mitigation by stimulating the growth of phytoplankton in certain parts of the ocean and enhancing oceanic CO2 uptake. Its implementation is greatly debated however and its mitigation potential has not yet been explored well. At present, it is still not possible to use carbon offsets generated through iron fertilization projects for complying with the Kyoto Protocol as trading these offsets is currently only possible on voluntary carbon markets. Company interests in such a commercial use of ocean iron fertilization do however already exist. Consequently, there is a need to explore the potential of ocean iron fertilization as a climate change mitigation option as well as regulatory issues connected with its implementation. This article combines these two aims by first examining the scientific background, quantitative potential, side effects and costs of ocean iron fertilization. In a second step, regulatory aspects such as its legal status and open access issues are reviewed. Moreover, the chapter analyses how the regulations for afforestation and reforestation activities within the framework of the Kyoto Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) could be applied to ocean iron fertilization. The main findings of this chapter are that the quantitative potential of ocean iron fertilization is limited, that potential adverse side effects are severe, and that its costs are higher than it was initially hoped. Moreover, the legal status of ocean iron fertilization is currently not well defined, open access might cause inefficiencies, and the CDM regulations could not be easily applied to ocean iron fertilization.

TI  - Phytoplankton Do Not Produce Carbon-Rich Organic Matter in High CO2 Oceans
AB  - The ocean is a substantial sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) released as a result of human activities. Over the coming decades the dissolved inorganic C concentration in the surface ocean is predicted to increase, which is expected to have a direct influence on the efficiency of C utilization (consumption and production) by phytoplankton during photosynthesis. Here we evaluated the generality of C-rich organic matter production by examining the elemental C:N ratio of organic matter produced under conditions of varying pCO(2). The data used in this analysis were obtained from a series of pelagic in situ pCO(2) perturbation studies that were performed in the diverse ocean regions and involved natural phytoplankton assemblages. The C:N ratio of the resulting particulate and dissolved organic matter did not differ across the range of pCO(2) conditions tested. In particular, the ratio for particulate organic C and N was found to be 6.58 +/- 0.05, close to the theoretical value of 6.6.

TI  - Mesoproterozoic marine biological carbon pump: Source, degradation, and enrichment of organic matter [ä¸­å…ƒå¤ä»£æµ·æ´‹ç”Ÿç‰©ç¢³æ³µ: æœ‰æœºè´¨æ¥æºã€é™è§£ä¸Žå¯Œé›†]
AB  - Carbon cycle is the most important pathway for life on the Earth. It plays a vital role in the global biotic and abiotic processes, further modifying the chemistry of surface environment. Among these interactions, the biological pump (BP) and microbial carbon pump (MCP) are regarded to be the most important vectors affecting marine carbon cycle. BP and MCP fix carbon dioxide in the surface ocean and transport it as biogenic particle or dissolved organic matter. These organic materials are largely reoxidized or occasionally buried in sediments. However, a proportion of the fixed carbon is stored in the ocean as recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon (RDOC). Such a long-term storage of carbon could exert an important impact on climate change and shape the habitability of the Earth system. Therefore, it is critical for us to understand the development of RDOC through geological time. Fluctuations in carbon cycle can be reflected in organic or carbonate carbon isotope, which shifted dramatically at two ends of the Proterozoic. But the Mesoproterozoic in between is characterized by a relative stasis of carbon isotopes, indicating a balanced carbon budget for almost a billion years. The size of the RDOC reservoir and mechanisms governing the stability in Mesoproterozoic oceans are unknown. In this paper, several biogeochemical cycles of BP and MCP in Mesoproterozoic oceans are discussed, including the source, degradation, and enrichment of organic matter. It is inferred that the primary production of organic carbon came from multi-source organisms, but mainly cyanobacteria, while the remineralization of organic matter was executed by denitrifying bacteria, iron-reducing bacteria, sulfate-reducing bacteria, and methanogens. Taking the Mesoproterozoic Xiamaling Formation (1.4 Ga) in the Yanliao Basin, North China, as an example, we quantitatively analyze the degree of microbial decomposition, which was controlled by primary productivity and redox state of water column. Integrated geochemical record (major and trace elements, iron speciation, stable isotopes, and biomarkers) reveals that the water masses of the Yanliao Basin varied between oxygenated, euxinic, and ferruginous, with evidence in some parts of the stratigraphy for an oxygen minimum zone setting. Aerobic respiration, nitrate reduction, Mn-Fe reduction, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis are proved to be involved in the degradation of the Xiamaling organic matter, confirming the theoretical framework of the Mesoproterozoic marine BP and MCP. Similar to the Phanerozoic, the operations of BP and MCP were jointly regulated by the microorganisms and depositional contexts. However, since the evolution of life is staged, there are marked differences in the source of organic material and the degree of biological degradation. We estimated an increase in oceanic RDOC to 1000 to 2500 trillion tons 1.4 billion years ago. The organic carbon burial in the Yanliao Basin might have reached 600 billion tons. The Mesoproterozoic also witnessed the emergence of nascent eukaryote ecosystems, that did not, come to prominence until much later in the late Neoproterozoic. The diversification of eukaryote is generally thought to be hindered by oxygen content and nutrient availability. Based on recent investigations of the Mesoproterozoic strata in China, a potential oxygenation event (namely the Mesoproterozoic oxygenation event) has been proposed, which could support the respiratory requirements of early eukaryotic organisms. Thus, besides oxygen concentration, we consider phosphorus availability and local redox as the main factors restricting BP and MCP. It is possible that the primary productivity in Mesoproterozoic oceans was ultimately limited by phosphorus supply, though the current reconstructions of ancient phosphate level are problematic. By extension, the widespread presence of ferruginous waters at that time may not only influence the phosphorous cycle, but also lead to substantial organic consumption due to strong dissimilatory iron reduction in the water column and sediments. Research on the Mesoproterozoic BP and MCP is still in its infancy, with insufficient geological instances and controversial viewpoints. Future studies should stand at the height of system science and comprehensively elucidate the geological and biological interactions. Â© 2022 Chinese Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

TI  - Artificial upwelling using offshore wind energy for mariculture applications [Afloramiento artificial producido con energÃ­a eÃ³lica con aplicaciÃ³n a la maricultura]
AB  - Offshore wind is proposed as an energy source to upwell nutrient-rich deep water to the ocean photic layers. A spar-buoy wind turbine with a rigid tube about 300 m long is proposed as a pipe to drive deep water up to the surface. The minimum energy required to uplift the water is the potential energy difference between surface waters inside and outside the pipe, which depends on the background density profile. The corresponding surface jump or hydraulic head, h, calculated for several analytical and experimental density profiles, is of the order of 10 cm. If the complete turbine power (of the order of several MW) is used for raising the water (assuming a 100% pump efficiency), in a frictionless flow, very large water volumes, of the order of thousands of m3 sâˆ’1, will be transported to the photic layers. In a more realistic case, taking into account pipe friction in wide pipes, of the order of 10 m radius, and a power delivered to the fluid of 1 MW, the volume transport is still very large, about 500 m3 sâˆ’1. However, such a large amount of dense water could sink fast to aphotic layers due to vertical static instability (the fountain effect), ruining the enhancement of primary production. Hence, some ways to increase the turbulent entrainment and avoid the fountain effect are proposed. From the energetic viewpoint, artificial upwelling using offshore wind energy is a promising way to fertilize large open sea regions. This mariculture application is, however, severely subjected to atmosphere and ocean climatology, as well as to ecological dynamics. The general problem is multidisciplinary, and some important physical, engineering and ecological questions need to be seriously addressed to improve our confidence in the approach presented here.

TI  - Artificial upwelling
AB  - R.D. Gerard and J.L. Worzel of our laboratory have recently suggested pumping cold sea water from 1,000 meters depth through large diameter pipes into a condenser area located on shore to intercept the flow of moisture-saturated trade winds. This air, when cooled, condenses much of its moisture, which will be conducted to storage tanks for use as drinking water, avoiding brine pollution of the sea caused by conventional desalination systems. The deep cold water of the ocean is many times richer in inorganic nutrients necessary to initiate the photosynthetic process than the surface waters of the euphotic zone. The deep sea water, which has been utilized as a source of cold for moisture condensation, will flow into closed-off lagoons near shore, where it will act as a fertilizer to stimulate primary production. A pilot scheme is now under way on the north shore of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where deep water is less than one mile offshore and where we have conclusively established that the waters from the nutrient maximum (700 to 900 meters deep) will create a phytoplankton bloom. This, in turn, could sustain commercial yields of organisms such as shellfish, crustaceans, fish, etc. The cost of pumping could be offset by the production of energy by the Claude process and by other cooling applications, such as air-conditioning, ice-making, cooling of conventional desalination systems, nuclear reactors, etc. Â© Copyright 1970 Offshore Technology Conference on behalf of American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers, Inc.

TI  - Pathways of Organic Carbon Downward Transport by the Oceanic Biological Carbon Pump
AB  - The oceanic biological carbon pump (BCP) regulates the Earth carbon cycle by transporting part of the photosynthetically fixed CO2 into the deep ocean. Suppressing this mechanism would result in an important increase of atmospheric CO2 level. The BCP occurs mainly in the form of (1) organic carbon (OC) particles sinking out the surface ocean, of (2) neutrally buoyant OC (dissolved or particulate) entrained by downward water masses movements and/or mixing, and of (3) active transport of OC by migrating animals such as zooplankton and fishes. These various pools of OC differ in size since their sinking, production and decomposition rates vary spatially and temporally. Moreover, the OC transported to depths via these various export pathways as well as their decomposition pathways all have different ecological origins and therefore may response differently to climate changes. Currently, most ocean biogeochemical models do not resolve these various of OC pathways explicitly; rather, they imply that OC is therein created and destroyed equally. In addition, the organic composition of these various pools is largely unknown, especially at depths below 500 m. Here, known processes of OC export from the surface ocean to the mesopelagic zone (100-1000 m) are briefly reviewed. Three OC export pathways and some of their sub-categories are considered. I refer to published studies of OC fluxes associated with the specific downward export pathways and identify gaps that need to be addressed to better understand the OC fluxes associated with the BCP.

TI  - Casting a Wider Net on Ocean NETs
AB  - Societal issues involving policies and publics are generally understudied in research on ocean-based Negative Emission Technologies (NETs), yet will be crucial if novel techniques are ever to function at scale. Public attitudes are vital for emerging technologies: publics influence political mandates, help determine the degree of uptake by market actors, and are key to realizing broader ambitions for robust decision-making and responsible incentivization. Discourses surrounding ocean NETs will also have fundamental effects on how governance for the techniques emerges, shaping how they are defined as an object of governance, who is assigned the authority to govern, and what instruments are deemed appropriate. This Perspective brings together key insights on the societal dimensions of ocean NETs, drawing on existing work on public acceptability, policy assessment, governance, and discourse. Ocean iron fertilization is the only ocean NET on which there exists considerable social science research thus far, and we show that much evidence points against its social desirability. Taken in conjunction with considerable natural science uncertainties, this leads us to question whether further research is actually necessary in order to rule out ocean iron fertilization as an option. For other ocean NETs, there is a need for further research into social dimensions, yet research on analogous technologies shows that ocean interventions will likely evoke strong risk perceptions, and evidence suggests that the majority of ocean NETs may face a greater public acceptability challenge than terrestrial NETs. Ocean NETs also raise complex challenges around governance, which pose questions well-beyond the remit of the natural sciences and engineering. Using a conceptual exploration of the ways in which different types of discourse may shape emerging ocean NETs governance, we show that the very idea of ocean NETs is likely to set the stage for a whole new range of contested futures.

TI  - Experimental and Analytical investigations of Wave-Induced Artificial Upwelling
AB  - Artificial upwelling is supposed to be a general technique to enhance the marine primary productivity and fishery resources by means of pumping the nutrient-rich deep ocean water (DOW) to the euphotic layer. The wave energy is the most conspicuous form of ocean energy, the extraction of energy from the waves can be a viable economic solution to the power requirements of artificial upwelling. To extract the wave energy, a structure which responds to the input wave motion is required. This paper presents our latest investigation on the wave-induced artificial upwelling device by a fixed rigid pipe submerged in the water. In this study, we improve the theoretical methods, and the calculated results are verified by the wave-tank experiments. It turns out that the upwelling rate was affected of the wave height H, the wave period H, the water depth h, the length of the pipe L and diameter of the pipe d, etc. Based on the theoretical calculations and experimental results, we can estimate the upwelling flow rate of the wave-induced artificial upwelling device applied in the open sea.

TI  - Carbonate counter pump stimulated by natural iron fertilization in the Polar Frontal Zone
AB  - The production of organic carbon in the ocean's surface and its subsequent downward export transfers carbon dioxide to the deep ocean. This CO2 drawdown is countered by the biological precipitation of carbonate, followed by sinking of particulate inorganic carbon, which is a source of carbon dioxide to the surface ocean, and hence the atmosphere over 100-1,000 year timescales. The net transfer of CO2 to the deep ocean is therefore dependent on the relative amount of organic and inorganic carbon in sinking particles. In the Southern Ocean, iron fertilization has been shown to increase the export of organic carbon, but it is unclear to what degree this effect is compensated by the export of inorganic carbon. Here we assess the composition of sinking particles collected from sediment traps located in the Polar Frontal Zone of the Southern Ocean. We find that in high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll regions that are characterized by naturally high iron concentrations, fluxes of both organic and inorganic carbon are higher than in regions with no iron fertilization. However, the excess flux of inorganic carbon is greater than that of organic carbon. We estimate that the production and flux of carbonate in naturally iron-fertilized waters reduces the overall amount of CO2 transferred to the deep ocean by 6-32%, compared to 1-4% at the non-fertilized site. We suggest that an increased export of organic carbon, stimulated by iron availability in the glacial sub-Antarctic oceans, may have been accompanied by a strengthened carbonate counter pump.

TI  - Can ocean iron fertilization mitigate ocean acidification?
AB  - Ocean iron fertilization has been proposed as a method to mitigate anthropogenic climate change, and there is continued commercial interest in using iron fertilization to generate carbon credits. It has been further speculated that ocean iron fertilization could help mitigate ocean acidification. Here, using a global ocean carbon cycle model, we performed idealized ocean iron fertilization simulations to place an upper bound on the effect of iron fertilization on atmospheric CO2 and ocean acidification. Under the IPCC A2 CO2 emission scenario, at year 2100 the model simulates an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 965 ppm with the mean surface ocean pH 0. 44 units less than its pre-industrial value of 8. 18. A globally sustained ocean iron fertilization could not diminish CO2 concentrations below 833 ppm or reduce the mean surface ocean pH change to less than 0. 38 units. This maximum of 0. 06 unit mitigation in surface pH change by the end of this century is achieved at the cost of storing more anthropogenic CO2 in the ocean interior, furthering acidifying the deep-ocean. If the amount of net carbon storage in the deep ocean by iron fertilization produces an equivalent amount of emission credits, ocean iron fertilization further acidifies the deep ocean without conferring any chemical benefit to the surface ocean.

TI  - Artificial upwelling in regular and random waves
AB  - Mathematical modeling conducted in this study evaluated the hydrodynamic performance of a wave-driven artificial upwelling device in ocean waves off the Hawaiian islands. The device consisted of a buoy (4.0 m in diameter) and a tail pipe (1.2 m in diameter, 300 m in length) with a flow controlling valve. Random ocean waves off the Hawaiian islands used in the device's modeling analysis were synthesized from a wave spectrum obtained from available data. For comparison, the device's performance was also evaluated in regular waves whose height and period are the same as the significant wave height and wave period of random Hawaiian waves. Modeling results indicated that an upwelling flow of 0.95 m3/sec can be generated by this device in random Hawaiian waves and an upwelling flow rate of 0.45 m3/sec can be generated in regular waves. A simple mathematical model which assumed that the device exactly follows the incident waves was used in previous studies. Analysis results also indicated that the simple model cannot satisfactorily simulate the relative velocity and acceleration of the water column in the device. Since the relative velocity and acceleration are important factors in determining the rate of upwelling flow, the simple model must be applied with caution. Â© 1995.

TI  - FACTORS LIMITING THE REDUCTION OF ATMOSPHERIC CO2 BY IRON FERTILIZATION
AB  - A limit on the reduction in atmospheric CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) in the next century resulting from purposeful Fe fertilization of the Antarctic Ocean is estimated with an advection-diffusion model calibrated with transient tracer distributions. To evaluate the possible increase in atmospheric CO2 with and without fertilization, we adopt a ``business-as-usual{''} scenario of anthropogenic CO2 emission. Such increase is computed from the atmospheric pCO2 in the ocean-atmosphere total C system as it responds to this emission scenario. Assuming completely successful Fe fertilization, we calculate an 8\% atmospheric CO2 reduction for a case with a 3 cm2 s-1 vertical diffusivity and 17.4 Sv upwelling flux, as derived from distribution of bomb-C-14 in the ocean. Hence, if atmospheric pCO2 reaches 800-mu-atm in the next century, the maximum possible reduction is approximately 64-mu-atm. Doubling of upwelling flux to 34.8 Sv results in a reduction of 96-mu-atm. If we assume the surface area of the Antarctic Ocean is 16\% of the total ocean area instead of 10\% as used in the standard case, the reduction is approximately 71-mu-atm. These results are independent of the respiration function adopted. As we hold the surface water PO4 content at a near-zero value, it makes no difference at what depth the organic material is oxidized (or whether it falls to the bottom and accumulates). Changes in the ps exchange rate over the Antarctic Ocean also do not have a significant effect on the magnitude of atmospheric CO2 drawdown. Doubling the gas exchange rate in the Antarctic region after fertilization results in a reduction of 68-mu-atm. Doubling of vertical diffusivity to 6 cm2 s-1 in Antarctic deep water yields a reduction of 75-mu-atm. The key parameters are the rate of upwelling in the Antarctic and the fate of this upwelled water. The length of the productive season influences the extent of pCO2 reduction. For 8 months of productive fertilization our model yields a reduction of 60-mu-atm, for 4 months a reduction of 50-mu-atm, and for 2 months a reduction of 40-mu-atm. The maximum O2 consumption in our standard case is estimated to be 133-mu-mol kg-1 at a depth of 600 m. However, O2 consumption depends on the reoxidation function in the subsurface water. If the organic flux reoxidizes completely in the upper 2,000 m, the maximum consumption of O2 at 500 m could reach 500-mu-mol kg-1. Hence, depending on the reoxidation function, an anoxic Antarctic thermocline could result from Fe fertilization. Both calculations regarding the seasonality of production and those regarding oxygen reduction are highly sensitive to parameters over which we have little control. They are included only to emphasize their potential importance.

TI  - Drivers of Carbon Export Efficiency in the Global Ocean
AB  - The export of organic carbon from the surface ocean forms the basis of the biological carbon pump, an important planetary carbon flux. Typically, only a small fraction of primary productivity (PP) is exported (quantified as the export efficiency: export/PP). Here we assemble a global data synthesis to reveal that very high export efficiency occasionally occurs. These events drive an apparent inverse relationship between PP and export efficiency, which is opposite to that typically used in empirical or mechanistic models. At the global scale, we find that low PP, high export efficiency regimes tend to occur when macrozooplankton and bacterial abundance are low. This implies that a decoupling between PP and upper ocean remineralization processes can result in a large fraction of PP being exported, likely as intact cells or phytoplankton-based aggregates. As the proportion of PP being exported declines, macrozooplankton and bacterial abundances rise. High export efficiency, high PP regimes also occur infrequently, possibly associated with nonbiologically mediated export of particles. A similar analysis at a biome scale reveals that the factors affecting export efficiency may be different at regional and global scales. Our results imply that the whole ecosystem structure, rather than just the phytoplankton community, is important in setting export efficiency. Further, the existence of low PP, high export efficiency regimes imply that biogeochemical models that parameterize export efficiency as increasing with PP may underestimate export flux during decoupled periods, such as at the start of the spring bloom.

TI  - Differences in the biological carbon pump at three subtropical ocean sites
AB  - [}1] We report primary production of organic matter and organic carbon removal from three subtropical open ocean time-series stations, two located in the Atlantic and one in the Pacific, to quantify the biological components of the oceanic carbon pump. We find that within subtropical gyres, export production varies considerably despite similar phytoplankton biomass and productivity. We provide evidence that the removal of organic carbon is linked to differences in nutrient input into the mixed layer, both from eddy induced mixing and dinitrogen fixation. These findings contribute to our knowledge of the spatial heterogeneity of the subtropical oceans, which make up more than 50\% of all ocean area and are thought to spread in the course of CO2- induced global warming.

TI  - The effects of natural iron fertilisation on deep-sea ecology: The Crozet Plateau, southern Indian ocean
AB  - The addition of iron to high-nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC) oceanic waters stimulates phytoplankton, leading to greater primary production. Large-scale artificial ocean iron fertilization (OIF) has been proposed as a means of mitigating anthropogenic atmospheric CO2, but its impacts on ocean ecosystems below the photic zone are unknown. Natural OIF, through the addition of iron leached from volcanic islands, has been shown to enhance primary productivity and carbon export and so can be used to study the effects of OIF on life in the ocean. We compared two closely-located deep-sea sites (~400 km apart and both at ~4200 m water depth) to the East (naturally iron fertilized; +Fe) and South (HNLC) of the Crozet Islands in the southern Indian Ocean. Our results suggest that long-term geo-engineering of surface oceanic waters via artificial OIF would lead to significant changes in deep-sea ecosystems. We found that the +Fe area had greater supplies of organic matter inputs to the seafloor, including polyunsaturated fatty acid and carotenoid nutrients. The +Fe site also had greater densities and biomasses of large deep-sea animals with lower levels of evenness in community structuring. The species composition was also very different, with the +Fe site showing similarities to eutrophic sites in other ocean basins. Moreover, major differences occurred in the taxa at the +Fe and HNLC sites revealing the crucial role that surface oceanic conditions play in changing and structuring deep-sea benthic communities.

TI  - Artificial Upwelling in Singular and Recurring Mode: Consequences for Net Community Production and Metabolic Balance
AB  - Artificial upwelling of nutrient-rich waters and the corresponding boost in primary productivity harbor the potential to enhance marine fishery yields and strengthen the biological pump for sequestration of atmospheric CO2. There is increasing urgency to understand this technology as a ``ocean-based solution{''} for counteracting two major challenges of the 21st century-climate change and overfishing. Yet, little is known about the actual efficacy and/or possible side effects of artificial upwelling. We conducted a large-scale off-shore mesocosm study (similar to 44 m(3)) in the oligotrophic waters of the Canary Islands to identify the community-level effects of artificial upwelling on a natural oligotrophic plankton community. Four upwelling intensities were simulated (approx. 1.5/3/5.7/10 mu mol L-1 of nitrate plus phosphate and silicate) via two different upwelling modes (a singular deep-water pulse vs. recurring supply every 4 days) for 37 days. Here we present results on the response of net community production (NCP), metabolic balance and phytoplankton community composition (<250 mu m). Higher upwelling intensities yielded higher cumulative NCP. Following upwelling onset, the phytoplankton community became dominated by diatoms in all treatments, but other taxa such as Coccolithophores increased later in the experiment. The magnitude of effects on the metabolic balance scaled with the amount of added deep water, leading to (i) a balanced to net-heterotrophic system in the singular and (ii) a net-autotrophic system in the recurring upwelling treatments. Accordingly, the mode in which nutrients are supplied to an oligotrophic system plays a crucial role in the ecosystem response, with recurring upwelling leading to higher long-term positive NCP than singular upwelling. These results highlight the importance of empirically measured local responses to upwelling such as community structure and metabolism, with major implications for the potential employment of artificial upwelling as an ocean-based solution to generate (primary) production.

TI  - High-spectral-resolution lidar for ocean biological carbon pump studies
AB  - Processes and strengths of the ocean's biological carbon pump are significant to the study of ocean carbon cycle. However, the development and the utilization of the ocean's biological carbon pump are greatly limited because of human's limited knowledge of the ocean. Remote sensing methods have played important roles in understanding and exploring the ocean, and the lidar is one of the most outstanding representatives for its high spatial and temporal resolution, especially the ability of the vertical detection. High-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) employs an ultra-narrow spectral filter to separate scattering signals between particles and water molecules without assuming a lidar ratio, and obtains the optical properties of the ocean with a high accuracy. Nevertheless, the complexity of the seawater causes variable optical properties, which gives huge potentiality to develop the HSRL working at different wavelengths in order to promote the inversion accuracy and increase the detection depth. The field-widened Michelson interferometer (FWMI), whose central transmittance can be tuned to any wavelength, can be employed as the HSRL spectral filter and solve the problem that the operating wavelength of the iodine filter cannot change. Moreover, the FWMI has a very large field of view, which gives its superiority over Fabry-Perot interferometer that is an another popular HSRL filter. The principle of the HSRL based on the FWMI designing for the ocean remote sensing will be presented in detail. Furthermore, the availability of the application of the FWMI influenced by the disturbance of the states of Brillouin scattering is analyzed and the preliminary theory shows that the HSRL instrument basing on FWMI could be employed in the marine remote sensing with a high accuracy.

TI  - Observing the Global Ocean with Biogeochemical-Argo
AB  - Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) is a network of profiling floats carrying sensors that enable observation of as many as six essential biogeochemical and bio-optical variables: oxygen, nitrate, pH, chlorophyll a, suspended particles, and downwelling irradiance. This sensor network represents today's most promising strategy for collecting temporally and vertically resolved observations of biogeochemical properties throughout the ocean. All data are freely available within 24 hours of transmission. These data fill large gaps in ocean-observing systems and support three ambitions: gaining a better understanding of biogeochemical processes (e.g., the biological carbon pump and air sea CO2 exchanges) and evaluating ongoing changes resulting from increasing anthropogenic pressure (e.g., acidification and deoxygenation); managing the ocean (e.g., improving the global carbon budget and developing sustainable fisheries); and carrying out exploration for potential discoveries. The BGC-Argo network has already delivered extensive high-quality global data sets that have resulted in unique scientific outcomes from regional to global scales. With the proposed expansion of BGC-Argo in the near future, this network has the potential to become a pivotal observation system that links satellite and ship-based observations in a transformative manner.

TI  - Offsetting the radiative benefit of ocean iron fertilization by enhancing N2O emissions
AB  - Ocean iron fertilization is being considered as a strategy for mitigating the buildup of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere. Assessment of this strategy requires consideration of its unintended consequences, such as an enhancement of ocean N2O emissions. This feedback could offset the radiative benefit from the atmospheric CO2 reduction significantly, because N2O is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2 itself. Our model results show that the magnitude of this offsetting effect is substantial, but is highly dependent on the location and duration of fertilization. We find the largest offsets (of the order of 100\%) when fertilization is undertaken in the tropics, particularly when it is of limited duration and size. Smaller, but still substantial effects are found when fertilization is undertaken elsewhere and over longer periods. These results suggest that any assessment of ocean fertilization as a mitigating option is incomplete without consideration of the N2O feedback.

TI  - Individual and interactive effects of ocean acidification, global warming, and UV radiation on phytoplankton
AB  - Rising carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the atmosphere result in increasing global temperatures and ocean warming (OW). Concomitantly, dissolution of anthropogenic CO2 declines seawater pH, resulting in ocean acidification (OA) and altering marine chemical environments. The marine biological carbon pump driven by marine photosynthesis plays an important role for oceanic carbon sinks. Therefore, how ocean climate changes affect the amount of carbon fixation by primary producers is closely related to future ocean carbon uptake. OA may upregulate metabolic pathways in phytoplankton, such as upregulating ÃŸ-oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, resulting in increased accumulation of toxic phenolic compounds. Ocean warming decreases global phytoplankton productivity; however, regionally, it may stimulate primary productivity and change phytoplankton community composition, due to different physical and chemical environmental requirements of species. It is still controversial how OA and OW interactively affect marine carbon fixation by photosynthetic organisms. OA impairs the process of calcification in calcifying phytoplankton and aggravate ultraviolet (UV)-induced harms to the cells. Increasing temperatures enhance the activity of cellular repair mechanisms, which mitigates UV-induced damage. The effects of OA, warming, enhanced exposure to UV-B as well as the interactions of these environmental stress factors on phytoplankton productivity and community composition, are discussed in this review.

TI  - Artificial upwelling using offshore wind energy for mariculture applications
AB  - Offshore wind is proposed as an energy source to upwell nutrient-rich deep water to the ocean photic layers. A spar-buoy wind turbine with a rigid tube about 300 m long is proposed as a pipe to drive deep water up to the surface. The minimum energy required to uplift the water is the potential energy difference between surface waters inside and outside the pipe, which depends on the background density profile. The corresponding surface jump or hydraulic head, h, calculated for several analytical and experimental density profiles, is of the order of 10 cm. If the complete turbine power (of the order of several MW) is used for raising the water (assuming a 100\% pump efficiency), in a frictionless flow, very large water volumes, of the order of thousands of m(3) s(-1), will be transported to the photic layers. In a more realistic case, taking into account pipe friction in wide pipes, of the order of 10 m radius, and a power delivered to the fluid of 1 MW, the volume transport is still very large, about 500 m(3) s(-1). However, such a large amount of dense water could sink fast to aphotic layers due to vertical static instability (the fountain effect), ruining the enhancement of primary production. Hence, some ways to increase the turbulent entrainment and avoid the fountain effect are proposed. From the energetic viewpoint, artificial upwelling using offshore wind energy is a promising way to fertilize large open sea regions. This mariculture application is, however, severely subjected to atmosphere and ocean climatology, as well as to ecological dynamics. The general problem is multidisciplinary, and some important physical, engineering and ecological questions need to be seriously addressed to improve our confidence in the approach presented here.

TI  - Feasibility analysis and trial of air-lift artificial upwelling powered by hybrid energy system
AB  - Artificial upwelling can lift nutritious deep ocean water to sunlit layer, as a result, it is able to promote primary production and is being paid more and more attention all over the world. Kinds of artificial upwelling method have been invented in recent years, however, few of them can fulfill the requirement of desired flow rate and balanced budget. The design of an air-lift artificial upwelling device powered by hybrid energy system is presented in this paper, where solar, wind and wave energy is exploited together to induce artificial upwelling. The preliminary results of an open sea trial lasted for 7 days have demonstrated that the hybrid system assembled in a floating platform with surface area of 12.5 m(2) can lift 4234 m(3) deep seawater from more than 20 m depth. In particular, the operation based on optimal dispatch strategy showed that the unit cost of induced artificial upwelling is only 0.005 US \$/m(3). The work presented in this paper constitutes a step towards the development of an advanced hybrid energy system used for artificial upwelling.

TI  - Globalizing results from ocean in situ iron fertilization studies
AB  - [} 1] Despite the growing number of in situ iron fertilization experiments, the efficiency of such fertilization to sequester atmospheric CO2 remains largely unknown. For the first time, a global ocean biogeochemical model has been evaluated against those experiments and then used to estimate the effect of a long-term and large-scale iron addition on atmospheric CO2. The model reproduces the observed timing and amplitude in chlorophyll, the shift in ecosystem composition, and the pCO(2) drawdown; it also proves to be of utility in interpreting the observations. However, a full ocean fertilization during 100 years results in a 33 mu atm decrease in atmospheric CO2, that is 2 to 3 times smaller than found previously.

TI  - Changes in biogenic carbon flow in response to sea surface warming
AB  - The pelagic ocean harbors one of the largest ecosystems on Earth. It is responsible for approximately half of global primary production, sustains worldwide fisheries, and plays an important role in the global carbon cycle. Ocean warming caused by anthropogenic climate change is already starting to impact the marine biota, with possible consequences for ocean productivity and ecosystem services. Because temperature sensitivities of marine autotrophic and heterotrophic processes differ greatly, ocean warming is expected to cause major shifts in the flow of carbon and energy through the pelagic system. Attempts to integrate such biological responses into marine ecosystem and biogeochemical models suffer from a lack of empirical data. Here, we show, using an indoor-mesocosm approach, that rising temperature accelerates respiratory consumption of organic carbon relative to autotrophic production in a natural plankton community. Increasing temperature by 2-6 Â°C hence decreased the biological drawdown of dissolved inorganic carbon in the surface layer by up to 31%. Moreover, warming shifted the partitioning between particulate and dissolved organic carbon toward an enhanced accumulation of dissolved compounds. In line with these findings, the loss of organic carbon through sinking was significantly reduced at elevated temperatures. The observed changes in biogenic carbon flow have the potential to reduce the transfer of primary produced organic matter to higher trophic levels, weaken the ocean's biological carbon pump, and hence provide a positive feedback to rising atmospheric CO 2.

TI  - Transparent exopolymer particles: Effects on carbon cycling in the ocean
AB  - Transparent Exopolymer Particles (TEP) have received considerable attention since they were first described in the ocean more than 20 years ago. This is because of their carbon-rich composition, their high concentrations in ocean's surface waters, and especially because of their ability to promote aggregation due to their high stickiness (i.e. biological glue). As large aggregates contribute significantly to vertical carbon flux, TEP are commonly seen as a key factor that drives the downward flux of particulate organic carbon (POC). However, the density of TEP is lower than that of seawater, which causes them to remain in surface waters and even move upwards if not ballasted by other particles, which often leads to their accumulation in the sea surface microlayer. Hence we question here the generally accepted view that TEP always increase the downward flux of POC via gravitational settling. In the present reassessment of the role of TEP, we examine how the presence of a pool of non-sinking carbon-rich particulate organic matter in surface waters influences the cycling of organic carbon in the upper ocean at daily to decadal time scales. In particular, we focus on the role of TEP in the retention of organic carbon in surface waters versus downward export, and discuss the potential consequences of climate change on this process and on the efficiency of the biological carbon pump. We show that TEP sink only when ballasted with enough high-density particles to compensate their low density, and hence that their role in vertical POC export is not solely linked to their ability to promote aggregation, but also to their contribution to the buoyancy of POC. It follows that the TEP fraction of POC determines the degree of retention and remineralization of POC in surface waters versus its downward export. A high TEP concentration may temporally decouple primary production and downward export. We identify two main parameters that affect the contribution of TEP to POC cycling; TEP stickiness, and the balance between TEP production and degradation rates. Because stickiness, production and degradation of TEP vary with environmental conditions, the role of TEP in controlling the balance between retention versus export, and hence the drawdown of atmospheric CO2 by the biological carbon pump, can be highly variable, and is likely to be affected by climate change.

TI  - Large decrease in ocean-surface CO2 fugacity in response to in situ iron fertilization
AB  - THE equatorial Pacific Ocean is a 'high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll' region where nitrate and phosphate are abundant all year round. These nutrients cannot therefore be limiting to phytoplankton production. It has been suggested that the bioavailability of iron-a micronutrient-may be preventing full biological utilization of the major nutrients. The results of a previous in situ iron fertilization experiment in this region provided support for this hypothesis, but the observed biological response resulted in only a small decrease in surface-water CO2 fugacity. Here we report a much larger, biologically induced uptake of surface-water CO2 that occurred during a second study. The fugacity of CO2 in the centre of the (iron-fertilized) patch of surface ocean fell from a background value near 510 Î¼atm to approximately 420Î¼atm, corresponding to a transient 60% decrease in the natural ocean-to-atmosphere CO2 flux. We conclude that iron supply to this ocean region can strongly modulate the local short-term source of CO2 to the atmosphere, but has little long-term influence on atmospheric CO2 partial pressure. However, if such a modulation also occurs in the Southern Ocean, then iron bioavailability at high southern latitudes could have a significant effect on atmospheric CO2 partial pressure for example over glacial- interglacial periods.

TI  - Role of zooplankton in determining the efficiency of the biological carbon pump
AB  - The efficiency of the ocean's biological carbon pump (BCPeff - here the product of particle export and transfer efficiencies) plays a key role in the air-sea partitioning of CO2. Despite its importance in the global carbon cycle, the biological processes that control BCPeff are poorly known. We investigate the potential role that zooplankton play in the biological carbon pump using both in situ observations and model output. Observed and modelled estimates of fast, slow, and total sinking fluxes are presented from three oceanic sites: the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, the temperate North Atlantic, and the equatorial Pacific oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). We find that observed particle export efficiency is inversely related to primary production likely due to zooplankton grazing, in direct contrast to the model estimates. The model and observations show strongest agreement in remineralization coefficients and BCPeff at the OMZ site where zooplankton processing of particles in the mesopelagic zone is thought to be low. As the model has limited representation of zooplankton-mediated remineralization processes, we suggest that these results point to the importance of zooplankton in setting BCPeff, including particle grazing and fragmentation, and the effect of diel vertical migration. We suggest that improving parameterizations of zooplankton processes may increase the fidelity of bio-geochemical model estimates of the biological carbon pump. Future changes in climate such as the expansion of OMZs may decrease the role of zooplankton in the biological carbon pump globally, hence increasing its efficiency.

TI  - IRON FERTILIZATION OF THE AUSTRAL OCEAN - THE HAMBURG MODEL ASSESSMENT
AB  - We have investigated the effect of an enhanced biological productivity, caused by an artificial iron fertilization, in the southern ocean with a three-dimensional carbon cycle model, which is based on an ocean circulation obtained by an ocean general circulation model. The increase of the biological production did not result in a substantial increase Of CO2 uptake by the ocean, as it has been proposed by Martin et al. (1990). We have found that - assuming that the basic structure of the particulate downward flux does not change when higher production occurs - the ocean circulation provides a higher return flux of remineralized products that compensates two thirds of the effect of the higher export production on the atmospheric pCO2. This finding is only slightly modified when assuming a much deeper penetration of particle flux due to the fertilization. Owing to the nonlinearity of the buffer factor the absolute value of CO2 reduction in the atmosphere is higher at high levels Of pCO2. In view of the logarithmic dependency of the radiative forcing on CO2, the fertilization is more efficient at low CO2 levels. With our carbon cycle model we have, in essence, confirmed earlier three-dimensional model studies with a simplified geochemical cycling of the Princeton group (Sarmiento and Orr, 1991).

TI  - Continental and Sea Ice Iron Sources Fertilize the Southern Ocean in Synergy
AB  - Iron release from melting continental and sea ice is deemed important for phytoplankton, the growth of which is iron-limited in the Southern Ocean. Both sources are generally considered separately, yet their effects on the biological carbon pump could interact. Using a global ocean-sea-ice-biogeochemical model with a representation of both continental and sea ice iron sources, we find them to have an overall additive effect on phytoplankton activity, increasing carbon export by +13.9% of the Southern Ocean total, with continental ice contributing +4.5% and sea ice +8.0%. The +1.4% residual is due to a coupled fertilization effect: When the iron source from continental ice is activated, iron in sea ice increases by 16%, so does iron transport toward low production areas. Overall, this increases phytoplankton activity: Fertilization is more efficient where sea ice melts than at locations of initial iron release by continental ice. Â© 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Ocean Acidification-Induced Restructuring of the Plankton Food Web Can Influence the Degradation of Sinking Particles
AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) is expected to alter plankton community structure in the future ocean. This, in turn, could change the composition of sinking organic matter and the efficiency of the biological carbon pump. So far, most OA experiments involving entire plankton communities have been conducted in meso- to eutrophic environments. However, recent studies suggest that OA effects may be more pronounced during prolonged periods of nutrient limitation. In this study, we investigated how OA-induced changes in low-nutrient adapted plankton communities of the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean may affect particulate organic matter (POM) standing stocks, POM fluxes, and POM stoichiometry. More specifically, we compared the elemental composition of POM suspended in the water column to the corresponding sinking material collected in sediment traps. Three weeks into the experiment, we simulated a natural upwelling event by adding nutrient-rich deep-water to all mesocosms, which induced a diatom-dominated phytoplankton bloom. Our results show that POM was more efficiently retained in the water column in the highest CO2 treatment levels (>800 mu atm pCO(2)) subsequent to this bloom. We further observed significantly lower C:N and C:P ratios in post-bloom sedimented POM in the highest CO2 treatments, suggesting that degradation processes were less pronounced. This trend is most likely explained by differences in micro- and mesozooplankton abundance during the bloom and post-bloom phase. Overall, this study shows that OA can indirectly alter POM fluxes and stoichiometry in subtropical environments through changes in plankton community structure.

TI  - Changes in the Dust-Influenced Biological Carbon Pump in the Canary Current System: Implications From a Coastal and an Offshore Sediment Trap Record Off Cape Blanc, Mauritania
AB  - Long-term data characterizing the oceans' biological carbon pump are essential for understanding impacts of climate variability on marine ecosystems. The ``Bakun upwelling intensification hypothesis{'' suggests intensified coastal upwelling due to a greater land-sea temperature gradient influenced by global warming. We present long time series of bathypelagic (approximately 1,200-3,600 m) particle fluxes from a coastal (CBeu: 2003-2016) and an offshore (CBmeso: 1988-2016) sediment trap setting located in the Canary Current upwelling. Organic carbon (C-org) and biogenic opal (BSi, diatoms) fluxes were twofold to threefold higher at the coastal upwelling site compared to the offshore site, respectively, and showed higher seasonality with flux maxima in spring. A relationship between winter and spring BSi fluxes to the North Atlantic Oscillation index was best expressed at the offshore site CBmeso. Lithogenic (dust) fluxes regularly peaked in winter when frequent low-altitude dust storms and deposition occurred, decreasing offshore by about threefold. We obtained a high temporal match of short-term peaks of BSi and dust fluxes in winter to spring at the inner site CBeu. We found synchronous flux variations at both sites and an anomalous year 2005, characterized by high BSi and C-org fluxes under a low North Atlantic Oscillation. C-org and BSi fluxes revealed a decreasing trend from 2006 to 2016 at the coastal site CBeu, pointing to coastal upwelling relaxation during the last two decades. The permanent offshore upwelling zone of the deflected Canary Current represented by the flux record of CBmeso showed no signs of increasing upwelling as well which contradicts the Bakun hypothesis.

TI  - Extraordinary Carbon Fluxes on the Shallow Pacific Arctic Shelf During a Remarkably Warm and Low Sea Ice Period
AB  - The shallow Pacific Arctic shelf has historically acted as an effective carbon sink, characterized by tight benthic pelagic coupling. However, the strength of the biological carbon pump in the Arctic has been predicted to weaken with climate change due to increased duration of the open-water period for primary production, enhanced nutrient limitation, and increased pelagic heterotrophy. In order to gain insights into how the biological carbon pump is functioning under the recent conditions of extreme warming and sea ice loss on the Pacific Arctic shelf, we measured sinking particulate organic carbon (POC) fluxes with drifting and moored sediment traps, as well as rates of primary production and particle-associated microbial respiration during June 2018. In Bering Shelf/Anadyr Water masses, sinking POC fluxes ranged from 0.8 to 2.3 g C m(-2) day(-1), making them among the highest fluxes ever documented in the global oceans. Furthermore, high export ratios averaging 82\% and low rates of particle-associated microbial respiration also indicated negligible recycling of sinking POC in the water column. These results highlight the extraordinary strength of the biological carbon pump on the Pacific Arctic shelf during an unusually warm and low-sea ice year. While additional measurements and time are needed to confirm the ultimate trajectory of these fluxes in response to ongoing climate change, these results do not support the prevailing hypothesis that the strength of the biological carbon pump in the Pacific Arctic will weaken under these conditions.

TI  - A seasonal carbon budget for a naturally iron-fertilized bloom over the Kerguelen Plateau in the Southern Ocean
AB  - During the Kerguelen Ocean and Plateau compared Study (KEOPS, January-February 2005), a high-resolution distribution of surface fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) was obtained from underway measurements. The stations in the core of the naturally iron-fertilized bloom were characterized by low fCO2 (311Â±8 Î¼atm) compared to the atmosphere, thus representing a large CO2 sink. This contrasted with stations typical of high-nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC) conditions where the surface water was roughly in equilibrium with the atmosphere (fCO2=372Â±5 Î¼atm). The vertical distribution of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) also was obtained at stations within and outside the bloom. Based on this data set, we constructed a carbon budget for the mixed layer that allowed us to determine the seasonal net community production (NCPseason) and the seasonal carbon export in two contrasting environments. The robustness of the approach and the errors also were estimated. The NCPseason in the core of the bloom was 6.6Â±2.2 mol m-2, typical of productive areas of the Southern Ocean. At the HNLC station the NCPseason was 3 times lower than in the bloom. Our estimate of the daily net community production (NCPdaily) within the bloom compares well with shipboard measurements of NCP. The NCPdaily obtained above the Kerguelen Plateau was of the same order as the estimates from Southern Ocean artificial iron-fertilization experiments (SOIREE and EisenEx). The seasonal carbon export was derived from NCPseason after subtraction of the seasonal accumulation of particulate and dissolved organic carbon. In the bloom, the carbon export (5.4Â±1.9 mol m-2) was 3-fold higher than at the HNLC station (1.7Â±0.4 mol m-2). Comparison of our results to artificial iron-fertilization experiments shows that the biological pump is enhanced by natural iron fertilization. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - There and back again, a journey of many pathways: conceptualising the marine organic carbon cycle
AB  - Understanding and determining the pathways that organic carbon (OC) takes in the ocean is one of the pressing tasks of our time, as the fate of OC in the ocean is linked to the climate system and the functionality of marine ecosystems. The multitude and complexity of these pathways are typically investigated with sophisticated, mainly quantitative, methods focused on individual pathways in order to resolve their interactions and processes as realistically as possible. In addition to these approaches towards understanding and recreating complexity, there is a need to identify commonalities and differences between individual OC pathways and define their overarching structures. Such structures can provide a framework for the growing number of partly overlapping concepts, which conceptualise selected OC pathways, and promote more systematic comparisons and consistent communication, especially between different disciplines. In response, we propose a (visual) concept in which we define such higher-level ``structures{''} by comparing and condensing marine OC pathways based on their sequences of processes and the layers of the marine system in which they operate. The resulting structures comprise ``closed loops{''}, three remineralisation and two recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon (rDOC) loops that close within marine systems, and ``open loops{''}, condensing pathways leaving the marine system for the atmosphere or deeper sediment layers. In addition, we provide a synthesis of embedded processes, OC pools, and process-performing organisms (agents) embedded in these loops. By translating a definition of the biological carbon pump (BCP) into our concept, we show how the application and discussion of our defined structures facilitate a consistent visualisation, a systematic comparison of differently resolved concepts and studies, and integration of these into the larger picture of the marine OC cycle. As a complement to quantitative studies and descriptions of individual pathways, our concept decomposes the complexity of OC pathways by defining new universal structures. These structures provide a skeleton that can be adapted to different systems and filled with life by the users.

TI  - Relationships Between Air-Sea CO2 Flux and New Production in the Equatorial Pacific
AB  - The equatorial Pacific is the largest oceanic source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This outgassing varies depending on the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and decadal climate variability. New production, the amount of phytoplankton net primary production driven by upwelled nitrate, plays a significant role in modulating air-sea CO2 fluxes as the biological carbon pump removes carbon from the surface ocean. We aim to understand how the physical drivers of sea surface temperature and wind speed influence interannual and decadal variability of the equatorial Pacific carbon cycle. In the equatorial Pacific, there are three biogeochemical regimes: the upwelling cold tongue east of 140 degrees W and south of the equator (3 degrees N-15 degrees S); the eastern Pacific warm pool north of the equator (3 degrees-15 degrees N); and the 28.5 degrees C western Pacific warm pool, west of 140 degrees W. We find that between 2000 and 2020, air-sea CO2 flux and Delta pCO(2) increased in the cold tongue (45 mmolC m(-2) yr(-2), 1.5 mu atm yr(-1), respectively) but decreased elsewhere, while new production decreased everywhere. The western Pacific occasionally became a weak carbon sink, depending on ENSO and this sink was strongest at 165 degrees E during central Pacific ``Modoki{''} El Nino events. We find that changes in wind speed, temperature and ENSO frequency have altered the surface carbon budget. The mean basin-wide (150 degrees E-90 degrees W and 15 degrees N-15 degrees S) new production for 2000-2020 was 1.2 +/- 0.1 PgC yr(-1) and air-sea CO2 flux was 0.5 +/- 0.1 PgC yr(-1). New production decreased at -7.7 +/- 1.6 TgC yr(-2), compared to the CO2 flux trend of -1.7 +/- 1.4 TgC yr(-2).

This heat can be utilized to generate mechanical energy and fresh water by using the cold deep water, only about 1000 m below this vast heat reservoir, as the heat sink. After its use in the condenser of the power-generating or desalination plant, the deep water can be used in a mariculture system to produce plant and animal protein. In a small shore-based pilot plant on the north shore of St. Croix, U. S. Virgin Islands, the technical feasibility of artificial upwelling mariculture has been demonstrated and its economic potential is now under evaluation. The plant protein yield per unit surface area achieved in St. Croix is 8. 1 t/ha/yr. At current market prices, the gross sales volume of deep seawater pumped to the surface is considerably greater than that of the energy OTEC (Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion) power systems presently under consideration in the U. S. could generate from the same volume of deep water.

TI  - Oligotrophic Phytoplankton Community Effectively Adjusts to Artificial Upwelling Regardless of Intensity, but Differently Among Upwelling Modes
AB  - Artificial upwelling has been proposed as a means of enhancing oceanic CO2 sequestration and/or raising fishery yields through an increase in primary production in unproductive parts of the ocean. However, evidence of its efficacy, applicability and side effects is scarce. Here we present part of the results of a 37-day mesocosm study conducted in oligotrophic waters off the coast of Gran Canaria. The goal was to assess in situ the effects of artificial upwelling on the pelagic community. Upwelling was simulated via two modes: i) a singular deep-water pulse and ii) a recurring supply every 4 days; each mode at four different intensities defined by the total amount of nitrate added: approx. 1.5, 3, 5.7, and 11 mu mol L-1. In this study we focus on the phytoplankton response through size-fractionated C-14 primary production rates (PP), Chlorophyll a and biomass. We observed increases in PP, accumulated PP, Chlorophyll a and biomass that scaled linearly with upwelling intensity. Upwelling primarily benefitted larger phytoplankton size fractions, causing a shift from pico- and nano- to nano- and microphytoplankton. Recurring deep-water addition produced more biomass under higher upwelling intensities than a single pulse addition. It also reached significantly higher accumulated PP per unit of added nutrients and showed a stronger reduction in percentage extracellular release with increasing upwelling intensity. These results demonstrate that oligotrophic phytoplankton communities can effectively adjust to artificial upwelling regardless of upwelling intensity, but differently depending on the upwelling mode. Recurring supply of upwelled waters generated higher efficiencies in primary production and biomass build-up than a single pulse of the same volume and nutrient load.
