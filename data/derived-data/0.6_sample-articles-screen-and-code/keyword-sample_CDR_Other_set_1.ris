TI  - Carbon capture and adjustment of water and hydrocarbon dew-points via absorption with ionic liquid [Bmim][NTf2] in offshore processing of CO2-rich natural gas
AB  - Offshore oil production from huge reservoirs at deep waters with high gas-oil ratio and high carbon dioxide (CO2) content is a challenging puzzle because oil extraction imposes to process a huge flow rate of raw CO2-rich natural gas from which CO2 must be separated and sent to appropriate destination. Offshore gas processing comprises three steps: water dew-point adjustment (WDPA), hydrocarbon dew-point adjustment (HCDPA) and CO2 removal to avoid transport of inert and to boost oil production by injecting CO2 into the reservoir for enhanced oil recovery. In offshore rigs, gas is conventionally treated via TEG absorption for WDPA, Joule-Thomson expansion for HCDPA and membrane permeation for CO2 removal. This work discloses a new concept of CO2-rich natural gas processing using the ionic-liquid [Bmim][NTf2] for simultaneous WDPA, HCDPA and CO2 removal. All results were obtained via rigorous simulations, including the ionic-liquid implications in vapor-liquid equilibrium and heat-effects. The main novelty of the new process is its high-pressure selective stripping of CO2, lowering compression power for enhanced oil recovery utilization. Economic comparison of conventional gas processing with the ionic-liquid gas processing shows that the latter has 19.3% higher revenues, 23.6% less manufacturing costs and 18% less investment, entailing a 37% higher net present value.

TI  - Gas-liquid mass-transfer behavior of packed-bed scrubbers for floating/offshore CO2 capture
AB  - The amine-based CO2 capture performance of packed bed scrubbers onboard offshore floating vessels was assessed in a systematic study using a hexapod robot with six-degree-of-freedom motions and an embarked column packed with structured elements (M500X) and Raschig rings. The potential bottlenecks stemming from ship tilts and oscillations on the mass transfer performance of the packed-bed scrubber were addressed in terms of effective gas-liquid interfacial area, CO2 removal efficiency, and overall volumetric mass-transfer coefficient. The results revealed that the CO2 absorption performance under offshore conditions would deviate from those measured with conventional vertical/stationary packed bed scrubbers. The effective gas-liquid interfacial area was found to decrease with incrementing tilt angle between 0Â° and 15Â° both for structured and random packings. Under column roll and roll + pitch oscillations, the interfacial area was also found to diminish monotonically with the oscillation period. Findings from this work indicate that the effect of offshore conditions and their influences on the packed-bed performance should be carefully considered in the design and scale-up of scrubber units subject to offshore floating perturbations since the mass transfer characteristics of packed beds onboard floating vessels are found to degrade with scrubber inclinations and oscillations.

TI  - Optimal synthesis of negative emissions polygeneration systems with desalination
AB  - Treatment of reverse osmosis desalination (ROD) brine has recently been suggested as a means to achieve negative greenhouse gas emissions via indirect ocean capture (IOC) of carbon dioxide. In this paper, a novel scheme that integrates the ROD/IOC process with combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) generation is proposed as a new negative emissions polygeneration system (NEPS). A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is then developed for the optimal synthesis and operation of such a system. The model uses a multi-period formulation to account for hourly variations in product demand and electricity price. The polygeneration system takes advantage of the flexible operation of the ROD/IOC process to operate as a Power-to-X (PtX) system, without the need for direct electricity storage in batteries. An illustrative case study is solved to demonstrate the model, and sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the effects of techno-economic uncertainties on system performance. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Fouling management in oceanic carbon capture via in-situ electrochemical bipolar membrane electrodialysis
AB  - To assist reaching net-zero emissions, the dissolved carbon in the ocean can be extracted to enable an indirect air capture. An electrochemical bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BPMED) is a sustainable method for such capture. The BPMED enables a pH-swing that manipulates the oceanic carbonate-equilibrium using electricity. However, at alkaline-pH, an in-situ process suffers from inorganic fouling within the stack, increasing the cost of capture. In the current work, we investigate fouling management strategies including fouling control (i.e., membrane- configuration and current-flow rate optimization) and fouling removal methods. Fouling removal methods including air and CO2(g) sparging, dissolved CO2 (aq) cleaning, back-pressure, flow rate increase, and acid-wash are investigated under accelerated fouling conditions. The stack configuration containing the BPM-AEM pairs shows 4 Ã— lower fouling than the BPM-CEM stack, while the carbonate-extraction and faradaic efficiency are similar for both configurations. From the scaling removal methods, only the acid wash combined with the back-pressure removed all the inorganic fouling, recovering both the cell voltage and pressure drop to their initial values. Upon the air sparging, the total cell voltage and pressure drop increased even more due to the trapped gas inside the netted spacers. Cleaning via dissolved and gaseous CO2 decreases the cell pH, dissolving hydroxide/carbonate-based fouling, but decreases the carbonate-removal significantly which is not preferred. Applying the back-pressure and higher flow rates decelerated the scaling buildup but was not enough to remove the fouling. Using BPM-AEM stacks in combination with periodic acid cleaning has potential as resilient oceanic carbon removal via BPMED. Â© 2023 The Author(s)

TI  - Potential of offshore wind energy for direct air capture
AB  - The world is setting aggressive targets for climate change mitigation and most pathway models require negative emission technologies (NETs) to meet these targets. Direct air capture (DAC) is a promising NET that captures carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmospheric air; however, indirect and embodied emissions to power and build DAC systems must be considered when exploring NET options. Wind energy has experienced rapid cost reductions in the past few years and experts predict a significant continued decline in offshore wind energy costs. Here, we develop a conceptual design and conduct an energy assessment of two dominating DAC designs to show the potential of offshore wind to meet the DAC energy demand for two different scenarios capturing 3.3 GtCO2/y (10%) and 11 GtCO2/y (33.3%) of current global CO2 emissions covering a range of estimates for future NETs required to meet net-zero goals. Energy assessment showed that the estimated energy requirement for the Carbon Engineering based design is higher as compared with Climeworks based design owing to the high temperature (900Â°C) requirement in the calcination step required for the desorption of CO2. However, conceptual design revealed that area requirements for DAC configurations are much less for Carbon Engineering based design comparatively. Employing offshore wind energy can eliminate indirect emissions associated with meeting DAC energy demands, facilitative modular NET deployment globally, be positioned geographically to avoid competition with grid decarbonization and take advantage of otherwise stranded offshore wind resources. Large-scale offshore wind energy integrated DAC systems, therefore, deserve development efforts and deployment alongside other mitigation and NET options. Â© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Challenges and opportunities in continuous flow processes for electrochemically mediated carbon capture
AB  - Carbon capture from both stationary emitters and dilute sources is critically needed to mitigate climate change. Carbon dioxide separation methods driven by electrochemical stimuli show promise to sidestep the high-energy penalty and fossil-fuel dependency associated with the conventional pressure and tem-perature swings. Compared with a batch process, electrochemically mediated carbon capture (EMCC) operating in a continuous flow mode offers greater design flexibility. Therefore, this review introduces key advances in continuous flow EMCC for point source, air, and ocean carbon captures. Notably, the main challenges and future research opportunities for practical implementation of continuous flow EMCC processes are discussed from a multi-scale perspective, from molecules to electrochemical cells and finally to separation systems.

TI  - Research progress in CO2 removal technology of natural gas [å¤©ç„¶æ°”è„±ç¢³æŠ€æœ¯ç ”ç©¶è¿›å±•]
AB  - Natural gas is a kind of clean energy with high calorific value, but raw natural gas contains a certain amount of acid gas CO2, which will cause problems like heating value reduction and pipeline corrosion. Therefore, it is necessary to remove CO2from natural gas before subsequent transportation and utilization. This article introduces four decarburization technologies: cryogenic distillation, solvent absorption, adsorption and membrane separation. The process characteristics and typical industrial applications of each technology are analyzed in details and compared from the aspects of feed conditions of raw gas, removal efficiency, energy consumption and cost efficiency, which is of great engineering significance and provides guidance for the selection of separation processes in different actual conditions. Membrane separation technology has certain advantages of small equipment foot print, low energy consumption and high-cost efficiency. Moreover, the flexibility and adjustability of stages in membrane process enables it with high CO2 removal rate and low hydrocarbon loss. Therefore, membrane separation technology exhibits good development and application prospects, which is especially suitable for space-limited applications, such as CO2 removal from natural gas on offshore platform.

TI  - Electrochemical Capture and Storage of CO2 as Calcium Carbonate
AB  - A carbon dioxide capture, conversion, and utilization technology has been developed that can be powered by renewable energy with the potential to mitigate CO2 emissions. This relies on an electrochemical process whereby the dissolution of carbon dioxide into carbonate ions is accelerated by a locally induced pH change at the cathode. The carbonate ions can then complex with metal cations, such as Ca2+, Sr2+, or Mn2+, present in solution to form their respective metal carbonates, which precipitate out of solution. To ensure the cathode is not fouled by deposition of the insulating metal carbonate, the process is operated under hydrogen evolution conditions, thereby alleviating any significant attachment of the solid to the electrode. This process is demonstrated in CO2-saturated solutions while the possibility of direct air capture is also shown, where the precipitation of CaCO3 from atmospherically dissolved CO2 during electrolysis is observed. The latter process can be significantly enhanced by using 5 vol.\% of monoethanolamine (MEA) in the electrochemical cell. Finally, the process is investigated using seawater, which is also successful after the initial precipitation of metal sulfates from solution. In particular, the use of renewable energy to capture CO2 and create CaCO3 while also generating hydrogen may be of particular interest to the cement industry, which has a significant CO2 footprint.

TI  - Footprint and detectability of a well leaking CO2 in the Central North Sea: Implications from a field experiment and numerical modelling
AB  - Existing wells pose a risk for the loss of carbon dioxide (CO2) from storage sites, which might compromise the suitability of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies as climate change mitigation options. Here, we show results of a controlled CO2 release experiment at the Sleipner CO2 storage site and numerical simulations that evaluate the detectability and environmental consequences of a well leaking CO2 into the Central North Sea (CNS). Our field measurements and numerical results demonstrate that the detectability and impact of a leakage of < 55 t yr(-1) of CO2 would be limited to bottom waters and a small area around the leak, due to rapid CO2 bubble dissolution in seawater within the lower 2 m of the water column and quick dispersion of the dissolved CO2 plume by strong tidal currents. As such, the consequences of a single well leaking CO2 are found to be insignificant in terms of storage performance. Only prolonged leakage along numerous wells might compromise long-term CO2 storage and may adversely affect the local marine ecosystem. Since many abandoned wells leak natural gas into the marine environment, hydrocarbon provinces with a high density of wells may not always be the most suitable areas for CO2 storage.

TI  - Electrochemical carbon dioxide capture to close the carbon cycle
AB  - Electrochemical CO2 capture technologies are gaining attention due to their flexibility, their ability to address decentralized emissions (e.g., ocean and atmosphere) and their fit in an electrified industry. In the present work, recent progress made in electrochemical CO2 capture is reviewed. The majority of these methods rely on the concept of ``pH-swing{''} and the effect it has on the CO2 hydration/dehydration equilibrium. Through a pH-swing, CO2 can be captured and recovered by shifting the pH of a working fluid between acidic and basic pH. Such swing can be applied electrochemically through electrolysis, bipolar membrane electrodialysis, reversible redox reactions and capacitive deionization. In this review, we summarize main parameters governing these electrochemical pH-swing processes and put the concept in the framework of available worldwide capture technologies. We analyse the energy efficiency and consumption of such systems, and provide recommendations for further improvements. Although electrochemical CO2 capture technologies are rather costly compared to the amine based capture, they can be particularly interesting if more affordable renewable electricity and materials (e.g., electrode and membranes) become widely available. Furthermore, electrochemical methods have the ability to (directly) convert the captured CO2 to value added chemicals and fuels, and hence prepare for a fully electrified circular carbon economy.

TI  - Achieving Paris Agreement temperature goals requires carbon neutrality by middle century with far-reaching transitions in the whole society
AB  - The concept of carbon neutrality is much emphasized in IPCC Spatial Report on Global Warming of 1.5 degrees C in order to achieve the long-term temperature goals as reflected in Paris Agreement. To keep these goals within reach, peaking the global carbon emissions as soon as possible and achieving carbon neutrality are urgently needed. However, global CO2 emissions continued to grow up to a record high of 43.1 Gt CO2 during 2019, with fossil CO2 emissions of 36.5 Gt CO2 and land-use change emissions of 6.6 Gt CO2. In such case, the global carbon emissions must drop 32 Gt CO2 (7.6\% per year) from 2020 to 2030 for the 1.5 degrees C warming limit, which is even larger than the COVID-induced reduction (6.4\%) in global CO2 emissions during 2020. Recently, China has announced scaling up its national commitments, aiming to peak its CO2 emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Achieving these goals requires rapid and far-reaching transitions in the whole society. On the one hand, deeper emissions reduction in all sectors includes decarbonization of energy, electrification, increasing share of renewables, energy efficiency, sustainable land management, decarbonization of transport, reducing food loss and waste, as well as behavior and lifestyles changes. On the other hand, possible actions by removing CO2 from the atmosphere involves enlarging land and ocean net carbon sink, CO2 removal technologies (such as Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage), and CO2 capture, utilization and storage technologies, but should be caution for their scales and tradeoffs.

TI  - Emerging Solvent Regeneration Technologies for CO2 Capture through Offshore Natural Gas Purification Processes
AB  - It is estimated that 40\% of natural gas reservoirs in the world are contaminated with acid gases (such as hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide), which hinder exploitation activities. The demand for natural gas will increase by 30\% from 2020 to 2050, with the rise of industrial activities and the lifting of travel restrictions. The long-term production of these high acid-gas fields requires mitigation plans, which include carbon capture, utilization, and a storage process to reduce carbon emissions. Absorption is one the most established technologies for CO2 capture, yet it suffers from extensive energy regeneration and footprint requirements in offshore operations. Therefore, the aims of this paper are to review and analyze the recent developments in conventional and emerging solvent regeneration technologies, which include a conventional packed-bed column, membrane contactor, microwave heating, flash drum, rotating packed bed, and ultrasonic irradiation process. The conventional packed column and flash drum are less complex, with minimum maintenance requirements, but suffer from a large footprint. Even though the rotating packed-bed column and microwave heating demonstrate a higher solvent flexibility and process stability, both technologies require regular maintenance and high regeneration energy. Membrane contactor and ultrasonic irradiation absorption systems are compact, but restricted by various operational issues.

TI  - CO2 from natural gas sweetening to kick-start EOR in the North Sea
AB  - The cost of CO2 removal from natural gas with subsequent storage is estimated and the results show that it can be very close to an economically viable process. The cost of removing CO2 from a natural gas stream(sweetening) using the MDEA process is 30% lower than cost of conventional amine MEA technology for CO2 capture from flue gas, putting this project at a much lower cost than capture from most other industrial CO2 sources. The cost of CO2 removal is as low as 35â‚¬/tonne. In addition natural gas sweetening projects will capture potentially larger volumes of CO2 than many industrial projects if new large gas fields are developed. The large scale could provide the necessary amount and steady supply of CO2 needed to kick-start the deployment of CCS. This could happen either by allowing a large-scale offshore central CO2 storage or offshore EOR projects. Large scale storage would reduce the storage cost for CO2 improving the cost benefit situation for a CCS project. A large scale EOR project could create a market for CO2 in the Nordic region that also land-based industry can sell to thereby reducing their costs for CCS sufficiently to allow industrial CCS projects to start.

TI  - A Comparative Economical Analysis of Technologies for CO2 Removal from Offshore Natural Gas
AB  - In the scenario of the Brazilian Pre-Salt fields, where associated Natural Gas (NG) shows high concentration of CO2, gas conditioning comes out as one of the main challenges. Among the possible capture technologies available, three alternatives stand out for CO2 sequestration: (A) gas permeation through membranes, (B) absorption columns using aqueous blends of ethanolamines and (C) application of hybrid membrane modules in series with amine absorption and regeneration columns. The main objective of this work is to investigate the technical and economical feasibility of applying these three separation processes on offshore platforms, given the stringent constraints on footprint and equipment weight, and for minimizing NG production and transportation costs. The methodology involves: (i) development of cases based on the Brazilian Pre-Salt gas composition. NG streams with CO2 molar concentrations ranging from 8 to 18\% are applied; (ii) Simulations of three process flowsheets, corresponding to each one of chosen technologies - A, B and C; (iii) Equipment sizing; and (iv) Analysis of economic performance through calculation of capital (CAPEX) and operational (OPEX) costs.

TI  - Supersonic separator for cleaner offshore processing of natural gas with high carbon dioxide content: Environmental and economic assessments
AB  - Supersonic separators offer a cleaner offshore processing of natural gas with carbon dioxide content from deep-water oil-gas fields. Conventional offshore gas processing comprises water dew-point adjustment via glycol-absorption, hydrocarbon dew-point adjustment via Joule-Thomson expansion, and carbon dioxide removal via membrane-permeation. Alternative processing contemplates the use of supersonic separators for adjusting gas dew-points followed by carbon dioxide capture via membrane-permeation (so-called SS-MP scheme); or for adjusting gas dew-points and also accomplishing carbon dioxide abatement (so-called SS-SS scheme). The conventional process is environmentally and economically compared with SS-MP and SS-SS for application in offshore rigs treating raw gas (44%mol carbon dioxide) to produce exportable fuel-gas (â‰ˆ20%mol carbon dioxide), while dispatching carbon dioxide rich fluid (â‰ˆ75%mol carbon dioxide) for enhanced oil recovery in the oil-gas field. Results show that SS-MP requires 7.8% less power than the conventional process. Moreover, implementing SS-SS deepens the advantage against the conventional operation because SS-SS produces carbon dioxide rich fluid at high-pressure, requiring much less compression power for enhanced oil recovery than the low-pressure permeate from membrane-permeation. SS-SS has lowest carbon emission (âˆ’28.3%), lowest power consumption (âˆ’21.3%) and best economic performance: lowest manufacturing cost and lowest compressor investment. Thus, SS-SS is the overall best and cleanest solution, with highest 20 years net value (+860 MMUSD) and lowest environmental impact. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Geoengineering for climate stabilization
AB  - Engineering the climate by means of carbon dioxide removal (CDR), Earth radiation management (ERM), and/or solar radiation management (SRM) approaches has recaptured the attention of scientists, policy makers, and the public. Climate engineering is being assessed as a set of tools to deliberately, and on a large scale, moderate or retard global warming. There are several concepts available, like injecting aerosol-forming SO2 into the stratosphere or placing huge objects in orbit to partly shade Earth from incoming radiation or fertilizing the ocean with iron for increased algae growth and creation of carbon sinks. Such concepts are highly speculative, and irrespective of whether they would work, they bear huge risks, from adversely affecting the complex climate system on a regional or global scale to potentially triggering droughts, famine, or wars. More research is needed to better understand promising concepts and to work them out in depth, so that options are made available in case they should become necessary in the future, when climate change mitigation and adaptation measures do not suffice and fast action becomes imperative. Apart from the technological hurdles, which are anyhow mostly far beyond todayâ€™s engineering capabilities, huge social, moral, and political issues would have to be overcome. The purpose of this chapter is to highlight a few common concepts of CDR, ERM, and SRM for climate engineering to mitigate climate change.

TI  - Solar methanol synthesis by clean hydrogen production from seawater on offshore artificial islands
AB  - Synthetic fuel production from renewable energy, water, and anthropogenic carbon resources offers a promising alternative to fossil fuels by reducing the consumption of nonrenewable resources and greenhouse gas emissions. This article presents a case study of a solar-based methanol plant that derives hydrogen and carbon dioxide material inputs from seawater on an offshore artificial island. Photovoltaic cells generate electricity for an electrolytic cation exchange membrane (E-CEM) reactor that simultaneously produces hydrogen and carbon dioxide, with freshwater for electrolysis via seawater reverse osmosis. Carbon dioxide hydrogenation in a low-pressure isothermal cascade-type reactor system produces methanol as a liquid fuel product. Thermodynamic assessment of the integrated system indicates solar-to-methanol energy and exergy conversion efficiencies of 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively, with the most significant losses occurring in the offshore concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) and E-CEM reactor unit.

TI  - Modification of Adsorbents for High CO2 Content Capture from Stranded Natural Gas Reserve: A Critical Review
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) commonly exists as undesirable component in natural gas streams. The continuous growing of the global demand makes it necessary to overcome the high CO2 content obstacle of stranded reserves. A wide variety of acid gas removal technologies have been developed, including chemical and physical absorption processes but none of them can combine the high efficiency and economic energy consumption. Each process has its own advantages and disadvantages. Using of adsorbents increasingly being selected for newer projects, especially for applications that have large flow, high CO2 content and located in remote locations such as offshore where compact and highly effective technology is required. This review highlights the importance of adsorbent modification on CO2 removal from natural gas reserve at high pressure and temperature using physical adsorbents such as zeolite and molecular sieve. Then, the focus is turned on the adsorbents chemical modification using organic amines to improve the adsorption efficiency towards CO2.

TI  - Thermodynamic loss analysis of a liquid-sorbent direct air carbon capture plant
AB  - Direct air capture of CO2 is often presented as a promising technology to help mitigate climate change, although proposed processes are highly energy intensive. We analyze Carbon Engineering's 1 Mt-CO2/year natural-gas-powered direct air capture (DAC) process, which requires 273.2 MW per plant, where we find that 252 MW are irreversibly lost, corresponding to a second-law efficiency of 7.8%. Our component-level analysis details the mechanisms by which these losses of thermodynamic work potential occur in the most energy-intensive plant segments. Here, we emphasize the effects of chemical exergy dissipation in the air contactor, where stored chemical exergy is released as low-grade heat into the environment. Other major losses occur in the calciner and its preheat cyclones due to the high temperature demanded by its internal chemical reaction, as well as in the water knockout system, CO2 compression system, and power island. Finally, we illustrate the issues arising from the use of natural gas as a feedstock for heat and power, and suggest directions to pursue for further analysis and process improvements, which we consider imperative to make this DAC process a viable option for large-scale CO2 removal toward IPCC targets.

TI  - Removal of high concentration CO2 from natural gas at elevated pressure via absorption process in packed column
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) removal is an essential step in natural gas (NG) processing to provide high quality gas stream products and minimize operational difficulties. This preliminary study aims to investigate the removal of CO2 at high concentration level from the mixture of CO2-NG gas stream at elevated pressure via absorption process. This is to explore the possibility of exploring high CO2 content natural gas reserves by treatment at offshore platform. A mixed amine solvent, Stonvent-II, was used for the absorption of approximately 75 vol\% CO2 in CO2-NG stream at a pressure of 10 barg. The initial solvent temperature was varied in order to study the impact of initial temperature on the absorption performance. Preliminary study at temperatures of 35 degrees C and 45 degrees C indicates that Stonvent-II was able to perform almost 100\% removal of CO2 under both conditions. However, the CO2 absorption effect took place faster when the initial liquid temperature was lower. This is because when the initial liquid temperature is high, the temperature increase in the packing bed caused by the reaction heat is high which impacts the efficiency of absorption negatively.

TI  - An Electrochemical Hydrogen-Looping System for Low-Cost CO2Capture from Seawater
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture from seawater is a viable, long-term solution for addressing legacy carbon pollution on the planet. However, significant challenges to widespread applicability exist in terms of efficiency, cost, and scalability. In this work, we have developed an electrochemical hydrogen-looping (EHL) system that capitalizes on the generation of proton and OH-from seawater. A CO2capture efficiency as high as 91% is achieved for our EHL flow cell. We have demonstrated that the electrochemical hydrogen-looping flow cell can remove CO2from simulated seawater at a record low electric energy consumption of 660 kWh ton-1CO2, which is a significant reduction of 56% compared with the currently used bipolar membrane electrodialysis technology. The electrochemical hydrogen-looping flow cell with its much lower energy consumption provides an economical approach for direct removal of CO2from seawater at practical scale.

TI  - Selective Conversion of CO2 by Single-Site Catalysts
AB  - Industrial revolution has led to increased combustion of fossil fuels. Consequently, large amounts of CO2 are emitted to the atmosphere, throwing the carbon cycle out of balance. Currently, the most effective method to reduce the CO2 concentration is direct CO2 capture from the atmosphere and pumping of the captured CO2 deep underground or into the mid-ocean. The transformation of CO2 into high-value chemicals is an attractive yet challenging task. In recent years, there has been much interest in the development of CO2 utilization technologies based on electrochemical CO2 reduction, photochemical CO2 reduction, and thermal CO2 reduction, and CO2 valorization has emerged as a hot research topic. In electrochemical CO2 reduction, the cathodic reaction is the reduction of CO2 to value-added chemicals. The anodic reaction should be the oxygen evolution reaction, and water is the only renewable and scalable source of electrons and protons in this reaction. There is a plethora of research on the use of various metals to catalyze this reaction. Among these, Cu-based materials have been demonstrated to show unique catalytic activity and stability for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to valuable fuels and chemicals. Moreover, the solar-driven conversion of CO2 into value-added chemical fuels has attracted great attention, and much effort is being devoted to develop novel catalysts for the photoreduction of CO2, especially by mimicking the natural photosynthetic process. The key step in the photocatalytic process is the efficient generation of electron-hole pairs and separation of these charge carriers. The efficient separation of photoinduced charge carriers plays a crucial role in the final catalytic activity. Compared with CO2 reduction via electrocatalysis and photocatalysis, thermal reduction is more attractive because of its potential large-scale application in the industry. Heterogeneous nanomaterials show excellent activity in the electrocatalytic, photocatalytic, and thermal catalytic conversion of CO2. However, nanostructured materials have drawbacks on the investigation of the intrinsic activity of the active sites. In recent years, single-site catalysts have become popular because they allow for maximum utilization of the metal centers, show specific catalytic performance, and facilitate easy elucidation of the catalytic mechanism at the molecular level. Accordingly, numerous single-site catalysts were developed for CO2 reduction to produce value-added chemicals such as CO, CH4, CH3OH, formate, and C2+ products. Value-added chemicals have also been synthesized with the aid of amines and epoxides. This review summarizes recent state-of-the-art single-site catalysts and their application as heterogeneous catalysts for the electroreduction, photoreduction, and thermal reduction of CO2. In the discussion, we will highlight the structure-activity relationships for the catalytic conversion of CO2 with single-site catalysts.

TI  - The Impact of Carbon Capture Storage and Utilization on Energy Efficiency, Sustainability, and Production of an Offshore Platform: Thermodynamic and Sensitivity Analyses
AB  - Oil and gas production in FPSOs (floating, production, storage, and offloading) faces a dual challenge: meeting variation in energy demand while decreasing its negative environmental impact. The present article integrates thermodynamic analysis of oil and gas processing plants and screening analysis to determine the most important operational parameters to lower energy demand and increase efficiency and production. Therefore, the main goals of this study are to identify the contribution of the total effect of the operating parameters in an FPSO with CCUS (CO2 capture, utilization, and storage). Twenty-seven thermodynamic and structural design variables are selected as input parameters for the sensitivity analyses. Four machine learning-based screening analysis algorithms such as smooth spline-analysis of variance (SS-ANOVA), PAWN, gradient boosting machine (GBM), and Morris are adapted to achieve the following objectives: (1) overall power consumption of FPSO, (2) CO2 removal efficiency of carbon capture and storage (CCS), (3) power consumption of CCS, and (4) total oil production. The influence of three real crude oil compositions with variations in gas-oil ratio (GOR) and CO2 content is assessed. The combination of thermodynamic and screening analyses showed that the optimal operating pressure parameters of CCS significantly reduce the energy consumption and exergy destruction of the key main and utility plants. Furthermore, the results indicated that total power consumption, CCS efficiency, and CCS power consumption are much more sensitive to the CO2 content of the fluid reservoir than GOR, while the total oil production is influenced only by the GOR content. Finally, for scenarios with high CO2 or GOR content, the effect of design variable interactions is decisive in changing the separation efficiency and/or the compression unit performance.

TI  - Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Capture and Release with a Redox-Active Amine
AB  - Anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from the combustion of fossil fuels is a major contributor to global climate change and ocean acidification. The implementation of carbon capture and storage technologies has been proposed to mitigate the buildup of this greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Among these technologies, direct air capture is regarded as a plausible CO2 removal tool whereby net negative emissions can be achieved. However, the separation of CO2 from air is particularly challenging due to the ultradilute concentration of CO2 in the presence of high concentrations of dioxygen and water. Here, we report a robust electrochemical redox-active amine system demonstrating a high electron utilization (i.e., mole of CO2 per mole of electrons) of up to 1.25 with the capture of two CO2 molecules per amine in an aqueous solution with a work of 101 kJe per moles of CO2. The capture of CO2 directly from ambient air as the feed gas presented an electron utilization of 0.78. Â© 2022 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.

TI  - CO2 absorption and kinetic study in ionic liquid amine blends
AB  - Carbon dioxide emissions are the main cause of global warming, rise in sea level and ocean acidification. Currently, post-combustion CO2 capture is the most matured technology that is employed by most of the industries. This paper investigated the ways to enhance the CO2 capture ability of the ILs. For this purpose, two ionic liquids 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidiazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Bmim]+[BF4]âˆ’) and 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidiazolium hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim]+[PF6]âˆ’) were selected and compared with conventional amine (MEA and MDEA) solvents. Experimental results showed that conventional amines have larger CO2 loadings as compared to both the ILs because of the reactive nature of amines with CO2. Therefore, it was proposed to prepare the blends of IL-Amine to exploit the reactive nature of amine combined with non-volatile nature of the ILs. It was observed that the [Bmim]+[BF4]âˆ’ blends with amine, have high CO2 loading as compared to pure IL as well as aqueous amine solution. Further, it was found that maximum CO2 loading results for 80% [Bmim]+[BF4]âˆ’-20% MEA blend. Piperazine (PZ) was further added to the blend as the promoter and it significantly enhanced the CO2 loading. Finally, the kinetic studies of various blends were performed and the kinetic parameters were evaluated. Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - CO2 separation from natural gas through hydrate formation
AB  - Presently, the major factor hindering the monetization of high carbon dioxide (CO2) gas field is the high capital cost for the Acid Gas Removal System (AGRS). Several technologies have been evaluated by the industry including the chemical absorption, physical absorption, cryogenic distillation and membrane system. It is essential to develop an alternative technology that is capable in removing the bulk of CO2 with favourable techno-economics. A new model of CO2 removal through the formation of CO2 hydrate is proposed, capitalizing on the concept developed for Integrated Coal Gassification Combined Cycle (IGCC). Using this concept, the operating parameters are chosen to be in region of thermodynamic equilibrium of CO 2, while at the same time being in the hydrate dissociation region of other gas components by varying the pressure and temperature. The selectivity of CO2 as the main guest molecule for the hydrate encapsulation is further promoted via the manupulation of thermodynamic and kinetic properties, including the solubility of CO2 in water and increasing CO 2 hydrate formation rate via the optimization of hydrodynamic properties. These variables are assessed in the continuous bench scale where hydrate slurries are formed in the tank reactor, and upon separation from the unreacted gas, is dissociated as the CO2 rich stream. The performance indicator of the system is the amount of the CO2 captured in the outlet stream compared to the feed gas. The paper discussed the separation system and its trending with operating parameters. Copyright 2014, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Improvement of marine carbon capture onboard diesel fueled ships
AB  - There is an urgent need to reduce the CO2 emissions from global shipping. This study developed efficient sea -based CO2 capture, CO2 compression and liquefaction for a 3000 kW diesel engine. Several mixed solvents, an intercooler and multiple feeds are used to improve CO2 removal in the absorber. A square-shape is adopted to reduce space, which is in scarce supply in marine applications. Heat integration is applied to enhance the per-formance of the stripper. An effective configuration is developed for marine CO2 capture to improve the absorber, stripper, CO2 compression and liquefaction. Mono-ethanolamine/piperazine (MEA/PZ) and N-methyl-diethanolamine (MDEA)/PZ increases by 1.7\% and 2.8\% in terms of CO2 removal compared to the MEA solution, respectively. The MDEA/PZ process with the intercooler and MDEA/PZ process with multiple feeds achieve 90.6\% and 90.5\% CO2 removal, respectively. The configuration using MDEA/PZ as a solvent, and the combined use of the intercooler, multiple feeds and heat integration demonstrate advantages for ship-based carbon capture. The CO2 removal for the final configuration is 1348 kg/h (94.7\%); this is an 8.4\% increase compared to the base case. Additionally savings of 100.0\%, 18.3\%, and 4.0\% are achieved in terms of stripper duty, compressor duty in CO2 compression and CO2 liquefaction, respectively.

TI  - Detecting and mapping a CO2 plume with novel autonomous pH sensors on an underwater vehicle
AB  - We report the first successful use of chemical sensors integrated on to an underwater vehicle to locate, map and estimate flux from a controlled sub-seabed CO2 release, analogous to a leak from a Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) reservoir. This has global implications for the efficacy and cost of monitoring of offshore CCS sites and hence public and regulatory confidence as this tool for addressing climate change is considered and rolled out. A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) equipped with three different pH sensors was deployed to determine the spatial extent of the controlled release. The sensors each operated on a different principle (spectrophotometric, fluorescence, and electrochemical) and the strengths and weaknesses of each sensor are discussed. The sensor data demonstrated that evidence of the plume was limited to within 3 m of the seafloor, as predicted by previous modelling work. The data were then utilised to develop a model of the plume, to extend the spatial coverage of the data. This comparison of the three sensors and the insight into plume dynamics provided by the model would assist in the planning of future plume surveys to ensure the sensor and vehicle combination can resolve the plume of interest.

TI  - Integrated Assessment of Carbon Dioxide Removal
AB  - To maintain the chance of keeping the average global temperature increase below 2 degrees C and to limit long-term climate change, removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (carbon dioxide removal, CDR) is becoming increasingly necessary. We analyze optimal and cost-effective climate policies in the dynamic integrated assessment model (IAM) of climate and the economy (DICE2016R) and investigate (1) the utilization of (ocean) CDR under different climate objectives, (2) the sensitivity of policies with respect to carbon cycle feedbacks, and (3) how well carbon cycle feedbacks are captured in the carbon cycle models used in state-of-the-art IAMs. Overall, the carbon cycle model in DICE2016R shows clear improvements compared to its predecessor, DICE2013R, capturing much better long-term dynamics and also oceanic carbon outgassing due to excess oceanic storage of carbon from CDR. However, this comes at the cost of a (too) tight short-term remaining emission budget, limiting the model suitability to analyze low-emission scenarios accurately. With DICE2016R, the compliance with the 2 degrees C goal is no longer feasible without negative emissions via CDR. Overall, the optimal amount of CDR has to take into account (1) the emission substitution effect and (2) compensation for carbon cycle feedbacks.

TI  - Offshore processing of CO2-rich natural gas and the role of supersonic separators-introduction
AB  - This chapter gives an overview on basic subjects that justify the existence of this book, the most important being the contextualization of offshore processing of CO2-rich natural gas (NG), besides CO2 separation and destination. A discussion and bibliographic review on alternatives for CO2 removal from CO2-rich NG are included. Some basins worldwide have potential to produce oil with associated gas, yet under high gas-oil ratios and high %CO2 (40 mol%) which entails the onus of low-grade gas processing enchained to huge CO2 dispatch goals. Here, the oil and gas industry meets great challenges, since the oil production, the main revenue factor, is bounded to huge CO2-rich NG production with 10-80 mol% CO2. Therefore, processing solutions are needed to turn high-capacity CO2-rich NG processing rigs into feasible and safe operations, sometimes hundreds of kilometers offshore. The supersonic separator (SS) is a promising technology that fits into this context due to its capability of simultaneous adjustment of dew-points in a single compact and low-footprint operation. Regarding CO2 removal, the most indicated technology is membrane permeation, which besides being suitable for CO2 abatement services, and is also compact and modular. On the other hand, the literature already signalizes potential SS application for CO2 capture from CO2-rich NG. Â© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019. All right reserved.

TI  - The Global Potential for Carbon Dioxide Removal
AB  - The global physical potential of different methods of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere is reviewed. A new categorisation into plant-based, algal-based and alkalinity-based approaches to CDR is proposed. Within these categories, the key flux-limiting resources for CDR are identified and the potential CO2 removal flux that each technology could generate is quantitatively assessed - with a focus on the present, 2050 and 2100. This reveals, for example, that use of waste nutrient flows to feed macro-algae for biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (algal BECCS), shows significant CDR potential, without needing the large land areas or freshwater supplies of plant biomass energy crops. Adding up the potentials of different CDR methods, the total CDR potential at present is 1.5-3 PgC yr(-1) (Petagram of carbon per year), comparable in size to either the natural land or ocean carbon sinks. Already 0.55-0.76 PgC yr(-1) of this potential has been realised through afforestation and inadvertent ocean fertilisation. The total CDR potential (without including direct air capture) grows such that by mid-century it is 4-9 PgC yr(-1) and by the end of the century it is 9-26 PgC yr(-1), comparable with current total CO2 emissions of 10 PgC yr(-1). The CDR that can be realised under social, economic and engineering constraints is always going to be less than the physical potential. Nevertheless, if combined with reducing CO2 emissions (conventional mitigation), CDR has the physical potential to help stabilise atmospheric CO2 by the middle of this century.

TI  - Ionic liquid [bmim][ntf2] as solvent for co2 removal in offshore processing of natural gas
AB  - Offshore oil production in deep waters challenges CO2 removal technologies since, for extracting the oil, a huge flow rate of CO2-rich gas must be processed. Currently, amine absorption and membrane permeation are widely used for CO2 abatement in offshore rigs although they present some drawbacks such as high heat demand for CO2 stripping and high-power requirement to meet trans-membrane partial pressure difference, respectively. In this context, due to their low vapor pressure, high thermal stability and low energy consumption, ionic liquids have been considered a promising alternative to conventional CO2 capture technologies. The aim of this work is to define the most economically suitable operating condition for CO2 capture from Brazilian Pre-Salt natural gas using ionic liquid [Bmim][NTf2]. According to a process condition screening methodology, based on CO2 and CH4 Recoveries, Specific Energy Consumption and Life Cycle Cost, alternative with a two-stage solvent regeneration at 15 and 4 bar configures the most suitable one.

TI  - A hybrid triboelectric nanogenerator for enhancing corrosion prevention of metal in marine environment
AB  - A hybrid spherical triboelectric nanogenerator (S-TENG) with both solid-solid and solid-liquid contact modes is successfully constructed to collect wave energy for highly efficient cathodic protection of metals in marine. To maximize collection of wave energy, the S-TENG is designed to simultaneously capture friction energy from inside and outside the device with different working modes, achieving a short circuit current density of 186 mA m(-3) and open circuit voltage of 88.9 V, respectively. It indicates that the potential drop of stainless steel (304SS) and organically coated carbon steel (Q235CS) coupled with the S-TENG are about 410 mV and 930 mV, respectively, which is suitable for their cathodic protection in marine environment. It is demonstrated that our S-TENG as a low-cost and environmentally friendly self-powered approach is promising to effectively converts wave energy for electrochemical cathodic protection in marine.

TI  - Electrochemical CO2 capture and storage with hydrogen generation
AB  - Electrochemical splitting of calcium carbonate (e.g., as contained in inexpensive and abund ant minerals such as limestone) is proposed as a novel method of forming hydroxide solutions that can absorb, neutralize, and store carbon dioxide from the air or from waste streams. CaCO3 is dissolved in the presence of the highly acidic anolyte of a saline water electrolysis cell, forming Ca(OH)2 and H2CO3 (or H2O and CO2). By maintaining a pH between 6 and 9 in the resulting solution, subsequent hydroxide reactions with CO2 primarily produce dissolved calcium bicarbonate, Ca(HCO3)2. Thus, for each mole of CaCO3 split, there can be a net capture of up to 1 mole of CO2. The resulting dissolved Ca(HCO3)2 can be diluted and stored in the ocean, or in reservoirs on land or underground. Net process cost is estimated to be &lt;$100/tonne CO2 mitigated. Other potential co-benefits of the approach include: i) production of significantly carbon-negative H2 if renewable - or nuclear - derived electricity is used as the power source, ii) the option of locally producing electricity and freshwater via fuel cell oxidation of the H2, iii) direct neutralization of ongoing ocean acidification if the Ca(OH)2 generated is added to seawater, iv) preservation or enhancement of otherwise threatened marine shellfish and coral populations, via CO2 absorption and Ca(HCO3)2 formation in or addition to the marine environment, and v) safe ut ilization of the ocean's vast carbon storage and energy production potentials for CO2 mitigation and "super green" hydrogen generation.

TI  - In Situ Electrosynthesis of Peroxydicarbonate Anion in Ionic Liquid Media Using Carbon Dioxide/Superoxide System
AB  - Climate engineering solutions with emphasis on CO2 removal remain a global open challenge to balancing atmospheric CO2 equilibrium levels. As a result, warnings of impending climate disasters are growing every day in urgency. Beyond ordinary CO2 removal through natural CO2 sinks such as oceans and forest vegetation, direct CO2 conversion into valuable intermediaries is necessary. Here, a direct electrosynthesis of the peroxydicarbonate anion (C2062-) was investigated by the reaction of CO2 with the superoxide ion (021, electrochemically generated from 02 reduction in bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anion derived ionic liquid (IL) media. This is the first time that the IL media were employed successfully for CO2 conversion into C2062-. Moreover, the charge transfer coefficient for the 02-generation process in the ILs was less than 0.5, indicating that the process was irreversible. Voltammetry experiments coupled with global electrophilicity index analysis revealed that, when CO2/02 was contacted simultaneously in the IL medium, 02. was generated in situ first at a potential of approximately -1.0 V. Also, CO2 was more susceptible to attack by 02-before any possible interaction with the IL except for {[}PMIm+]{[}TFSI-]. This was because CO2 has a higher global electrophilicity index (.wco, = 0.489 eV) than those for the {[}EDMPAmml {[}TFSI-] and {[}MOEMMorl {[}TFSI-]. By further COSMO-RS modeling, CO2 absorption was proven feasible at the COSMO-surface of the [}ITSI-] IL-anion where the charge densities were a =-1.100 and 1.1097 e/nm2. Therefore, the susceptible competitiveness of either IL cations or CO2 to the nucleophilic effects of 02-was a function of their positive character as estimated by their electrophilicity indices. As determined by experimental attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and DFT-FTIR computation, the reaction yielded C2062-in the ILs. Consequently, the presence of 0=0 symmetric stretching FTIR vibrational mode at ``'844 cm-1 coupled with the disappearance of the oxidative cyclic voltammetry waves when sparging CO2 and 02 confirmed the presence of C2062-. Moreover, based on DFT/B3LYP/6-31G, pure C2062-has symmetric 0=0 stretching at-805 and ``{''}844 cm-1 when it is in association with the IL cation. This was the first spectroscopic observation of C2062-in ILs, and the 0=0 symmetric stretching vibration has peculiarity for identifying C2062-in ILs. This will open new doors to utilize CO2 in industrial applications with the aid of reactive oxygen species.

TI  - Technical evaluation of the applicability of gas-liquid membrane contactors for co2 removal from co2 rich natural gas streams in offshore rigs
AB  - This work aimed to fulfill a technical evaluation of the applicability of gas-liquid membrane contactors (GLMC) to remove CO2 from CO2 rich natural gas in offshore rigs. For this purpose, a simulation case in HYSYS 8.8 (AspenTech) was performed to remove CO2 from a natural gas stream with concentration of 40% mol CO2 using an aqueous solution of monoethanolamine (MEA) 30% w/w. GLMC unit operation is not available in HYSYS, though. Hence, it was necessary to develop a mathematical model based on log-mean of differences of CO2 fugacities in both phases. Moreover, a GLMC Unit Operation Extension (UOE) was created for GLMC units to run in the process simulator HYSYS 8.8 using its thermodynamic infrastructure. The developed GLMC unit operation extension performed accordingly to the expected behavior. For a gas feed flow rate of 5 MMNm3 /d (typical from FPSO's), the calculated total GLMC mass transfer area was 1,986 m2, which requires 14 GLMC modules. Consequently, this operation showed to be a feasible option for CO2 removal in natural gas conditioning on offshore rigs. The heat ratio in the reboilers of CO2 stripping columns was found to be 167 kJ/mol, compatible with data found in the literature of CO2-MEA-H2O systems.

TI  - An economic approach for carbon capture and storage
AB  - The interest in on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) has increased over the last years with recognition of the ability of CCS to achieve a great reductions in CO2 emission as the fossil fuels will continue to be the main supplier for the world energy demand for the upcoming decades with no other alternatives are forecasted to replace them. The comparison between CCS and the other future alternatives or options relies mainly on the CCS cost -which is the main focus of this paper- removal of CCS deployment barrier in addition to the barriers and costs for the alternative options for CO2 emission reduction. This study gives an insight comparison between the electricity cost for five different options of power generation including Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT) without and with CCS, coal and finally the nuclear power plants. In addition, it determines the ranges of fuel and carbon prices at which each option can be economically deployed The recent coal CCS for Nth of a kind power generation plant cost estimates lie in the region of 60 to 100 $/ton of avoided CO2 which is higher than the previous CCS cost estimated and also greater than the accepted range of the forecasted carbon prices in the upcoming years. The higher costs of coal CCS would suggest the following: 1. Coal CCS power generation plants is way less economical than gas ones for the range of carbon prices less than 60-100 $/ton of avoided CO2 2. Even at carbon prices higher than 100 $/ton of CO2, coal CCS power plants still produces higher cost electricity when compared to the gas CCS ones as long as the natural gas prices are still lower than 9 $/MBTU 3. Coal CCS electricity costs are still higher when compared to a nuclear power plant option It is widely believed that the CCS power plants (Gas or Coal) are not expected to be economical over the upcoming years, however introduction of subsidized forms of CCS are likely to take place. Also, CCS technology components are expected to be economically implemented in operations like Enhance Oil recovery (EOR), so, in this paper, an economic evaluation is provided for using of CO2 extracted from natural gas plant into EOR operations. CO2 separation cost in the natural gas processing industry is less than the capture cost of CO2 in power plants as a result of its high gas pressure and the fact that CO2 removal is mandatory to increase the value of a natural gas resource On the other hand, this is not the case for the CCS of the most industrial emissions, as they are expected to be higher than those of power plants as a result of the smaller scale and wider distributed CO2 streams compared to power generation plants. This shows the importance of the realistic CCS cost estimation as a significant factor in the R&amp;D projects and implementation trials that try to overcome the tackles that face the application of such promising technologies.

TI  - Powering Negative-Emissions Technologies with Marine Renewable Energy
AB  - The majority of modeled emissions scenarios that meet the climate change goals outlined in the 2015 Paris Agreement require not only significant reductions in anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, but also removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere ('negative emissions'). To date, research and development efforts have largely focused on land-based negative emissions technologies, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. However, ocean-based technologies also have significant potential and avoid competition for land use and fresh water with agriculture and human development. Marine carbon dioxide removal approaches include biological solutions that seek to increase carbon fixation through photosynthesis and chemical solutions that aim to increase the absorption of carbon dioxide in seawater. Most of these approaches have significant power requirements, especially when implemented at the scale necessary to meet negative-emissions goals. Marine renewable energy is uniquely poised to power marine carbon dioxide removal given its ability to provide carbon-free power at sea. In this work, the power requirements of marine carbon dioxide removal systems and the potential of marine renewable energy to power them are investigated, culminating in recommendations for future research and development to enable such developments.

TI  - Towards Sustainable Oxalic Acid from CO2 and Biomass
AB  - To quickly and drastically reduce CO2 emissions and meet our ambitions of a circular future, we need to develop carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and utilization (CCU) to deal with the CO2 that we produce. While we have many alternatives to replace fossil feedstocks for energy generation, for materials such as plastics we need carbon. The ultimate circular carbon feedstock would be CO2. A promising route is the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formic acid derivatives that can subsequently be converted into oxalic acid. Oxalic acid is a potential new platform chemical for material production as useful monomers such as glycolic acid can be derived from it. This work is part of the European Horizon 2020 project ``Ocean{''} in which all these steps are developed. This Review aims to highlight new developments in oxalic acid production processes with a focus on CO2-based routes. All available processes are critically assessed and compared on criteria including overall process efficiency and triple bottom line sustainability.

TI  - Impacts on the marine environment from direct and indirect ocean storage of CO2
AB  - The potential effects of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel energy production, large industries and changes in land use on climate change is an area of research requiring and receiving massive global efforts. Possible impacts of climate change and variability on marine life have received some attention, mainly regarding changes in living conditions via changes in water temperature, wind and waves and other physical climate related forcing of the marine environment. There is also a chemical forcing of the marine environment caused by CO2 emissions to the atmosphere penetrating into the oceans. The perturbation of the marine environment through such indirect, i.e. via the atmosphere, storage of CO2 in the oceans may be estimated based on known and predicted atmospheric CO2 levels. Capture of CO2 from the flue gas of power plants and large industries followed by storage directly in the oceans may be a necessary component of a greenhouse gas mitigation strategy for the next century in order to achieve a stabilization of atmospheric CO2 levels. Direct storage of CO2 in the oceans may impose, at least locally, a stronger perturbation of the marine environment than indirect storage via the atmosphere. Storage of waste CO2 in aquifers below the seabed may also affect the marine environment if CO2 leaks out in the water column above. In view of the perturbations of the marine environment that are already ongoing as a consequence of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere and which will accelerate in the business-as-usual scenario as well as in scenarios including realistic CO2 removal options, there is a need to clarify the resilience of marine ecosystems to increased CO2. This paper discusses the large perturbations that are expected in various scenarios. One hypothesis is that direct ocean storage if performed in the most environment-friendly way map be acceptable, while continued emissions to the atmosphere and invasion across the air-sea-interface could lead not only to climate change but could also be harmful to marine food webs and ecosystem functions.

TI  - Global negative emission land use scenarios and their ecological implications
AB  - Earthâ€™s atmospheric CO2 level has increased beyond 400 ppm and still continuing to rise. In fact, this is the highest level in the last 2 million years. It appears we are heading towards an overshoot of CO2 concentration before stabilizing green house gases (GHGs) to keep global warming below dangerous level. In Paris on December 2015, the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) agreed to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2Â° celsius above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5Â° celsius. Can this level of CO2 stabilization still be achieved? One core strategies in the mitigation mix are negative emissions technologies (NETs) which are also explicitly described as important options in many IPCC (AR5) CO2 emission scenarios. Among others, BioEnergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) are shown their potential for CO2 removable from the atmosphere. BECCS as the NETs are most widely selected by integrated assessment models (IAMs) to meet the requirements of temperature limits of 2Â° and below. It is based on assumed carbon-neutral bioenergy combined with capture of CO2 produced by combustion and its subsequent storage in geological or ocean repositories. BECCS is a net transfer of CO2 from the atmosphere into geological layers. However, its credibility as a climate change mitigation option and their impacts to global and regional ecosystems are still unknown. To explore the ecosystem impacts of the large-scale deployment of negative emission land use scenarios, we review some papers that are analyzing global impacts of the land use scenarios on various factors of ecosystem services to look at the sustainability limits to their global large scale deployments. Ecological services implications of the NETs especially land demanding BECCS land use scenarios need to be addressed before implementing such projects not only for achieving global low carbon target but also achieving more comprehensive ecological sustainabilities to meet the sustainable development goals (SDGs).

TI  - A validated dynamic model of the first marine molten carbonate fuel cell
AB  - In this work we present a modular, dynamic and multi-dimensional model of a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) onboard the offshore supply vessel ``Viking Lady{''} serving as an auxiliary power unit. The model is able to capture detailed thermodynamic, heat transfer and electrochemical reaction phenomena within the fuel cell layers. The model has been calibrated and validated with measured performance data from a prototype installation onboard the vessel. The model is able to capture detailed thermodynamic, heat transfer and electrochemical reaction phenomena within the fuel cell layers. The model has been calibrated and validated with measured performance data from a prototype installation onboard the offshore supply vessel. The calibration process included parameter identification, sensitivity analysis to identify the critical model parameters, and iterative calibration of these to minimize the overall prediction error. The calibrated model has a low prediction error of 4\% for the operating range of the cell, exhibiting at the same time a physically sound qualitative behavior in terms of thermodynamic heat transfer and electrochemical phenomena, both on steady-state and transient operation. The developed model is suitable for a wide range of studies covering the aspects of thermal efficiency, performance, operability, safety and endurance/degradation, which are necessary to introduce fuel cells in ships. The aim of this MCFC model is to aid to the introduction, design, concept approval and verification of environmentally friendly marine applications such as fuel cells, in a cost-effective, fast and safe manner.

TI  - Impacts on the marine environment from direct and indirect ocean storage of CO2
AB  - The potential effects of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel energy production, large industries and changes in land use on climate change is an area of research requiring and receiving massive global efforts. Possible impacts of climate change and variability on marine life have received some attention, mainly regarding changes in living conditions via changes in water temperature, wind and waves and other physical climate related forcing of the marine environment. There is also a chemical forcing of the marine environment caused by CO2 emissions to the atmosphere penetrating into the oceans. The perturbation of the marine environment through such indirect, i.e. via the atmosphere, storage of CO2 in the oceans may be estimated based on known and predicted atmospheric CO2 levels. Capture of CO2 from the flue gas of power plants and large industries followed by storage directly in the oceans may be a necessary component of a greenhouse gas mitigation strategy for the next century in order to achieve a stabilization of atmospheric CO2 levels. Direct storage of CO2 in the oceans may impose, at least locally, a stronger perturbation of the marine environment than indirect storage via the atmosphere. Storage of waste CO2 in aquifers below the seabed may also affect the marine environment if CO2 leaks out in the water column above.

TI  - Geoengineering: From science fantasy to reality
AB  - Risky geoengineering solutions are increasingly seen as a viable option for combating global warming. Advanced research is under way on ambitious methods to alter the earth's climate, from increasing the planet's reflectivity, by seeding the atmosphere with SO2, to altering the composition of its oceans to increase CO2 absorption. A study from the US House of Representatives' Committee on Science and Technology - Geoengineering the climate: research needs and strategies for international co-ordination - has been released. Possible solutions fall into two broad categories - those that reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the earth - so-called solar-radiation management (SRM) - and those that provide ways to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and store it. CO2-removal technology is already under development in the form of carbon capture and storage, but the possibility of stripping CO2 directly, or indirectly from the atmosphere is also being considered. Technologies for stripping CO2 from the atmosphere an another CO2-absorption technology, biochar production, are discussed.

AB  - : Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture from seawater is a viable, long-term solution for addressing legacy carbon pollution on the planet. However, significant challenges to widespread applicability exist in terms of efficiency, cost, and scalability. In this work, we have developed an electrochemical hydrogen-looping (EHL) system that capitalizes on the generation of proton and OH- from seawater. A CO2 capture efficiency as high as 91\% is achieved for our EHL flow cell. We have demonstrated that the electrochemical hydrogen-looping flow cell can remove CO2 from simulated seawater at a record low electric energy consumption of 660 kWh ton-1 CO2, which is a significant reduction of 56\% compared with the currently used bipolar membrane electrodialysis technology. The electrochemical hydrogen-looping flow cell with its much lower energy consumption provides an economical approach for direct removal of CO2 from seawater at practical scale.

TI  - Can BECCS deliver sustainable and resource efficient negative emissions?
AB  - Negative emissions technologies (NETs) in general and bioenergy with CO2 capture and storage (BECCS) in particular are commonly regarded as vital yet controversial to meeting our climate goals. In this contribution we present a whole-systems analysis of the BECCS value chain associated with cultivation, harvesting, transport and conversion in dedicated biomass power stations in conjunction with CCS, of a range of biomass resources - both dedicated energy crops (miscanthus, switchgrass, short rotation coppice willow), and agricultural residues (wheat straw). We explicitly consider the implications of sourcing the biomass from different regions, climates and land types. The water, carbon and energy footprints of each value chain were calculated, and their impact on the overall system water, carbon and power efficiencies was evaluated. An extensive literature review was performed and a statistical analysis of the available data is presented. In order to describe the dynamic greenhouse gas balance of such a system, a yearly accounting of the emissions was performed over the lifetime of a BECCS facility, and the carbon ``breakeven time'' and lifetime net CO2 removal from the atmosphere were determined. The effects of direct and indirect land use change were included, and were found to be a key determinant of the viability of a BECCS project. Overall we conclude that, depending on the conditions of its deployment, BECCS could lead to both carbon positive and negative results. The total quantity of CO2 removed from the atmosphere over the project lifetime and the carbon breakeven time were observed to be highly case specific. This has profound implications for the policy frameworks required to incentivise and regulate the widespread deployment of BECCS technology. The results of a sensitivity analysis on the model combined with the investigation of alternate supply chain scenarios elucidated key levers to improve the sustainability of BECCS: (1) measuring and limiting the impacts of direct and indirect land use change, (2) using carbon neutral power and organic fertilizer, (3) minimising biomass transport, and prioritising sea over road transport, (4) maximising the use of carbon negative fuels, and (5) exploiting alternative biomass processing options, e.g., natural drying or torrefaction. A key conclusion is that, regardless of the biomass and region studied, the sustainability of BECCS relies heavily on intelligent management of the supply chain.

TI  - Assessing the terrestrial capacity for Negative Emission Technologies in Ireland
AB  - Negative emissions technologies (NETs) and their potential role in meeting emission targets is a rapidly growing and contentious area of climate change mitigation research. The literature ranges in scope from general reviews of NETs options to research and development through applied case studies. Within this field, a gap exists in the application of this growing body of research to the unique limitations and opportunities of a specific nation. Ireland is a small developed island nation in the EU with a unique emissions profile, as 32% of the total comes from agriculture due to the high number of cattle. In this study we aim to assess the potential capacity of terrestrial NETs options for Ireland and review the nation-specific context for their deployment. Despite the proportionally high representation of biochar and carbon capture and storage in the international NETs research, in an Irish context afforestation and bioenergy crops are much more established practices and could readily be considered in possible emission pathways that use NETs. Higher capacities were found for NETs options that are currently unavailable (direct air carbon capture and storage and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage), while options available to deploy at scale (afforestation, soil carbon management and biochar) have capacities limited by saturation of soil carbon stock and have higher risk of reversibility due to impermanence. Hence, while we estimate a reasonable technical capacity for NETs in Ireland, emission reduction remains the highest priority for feasibly meeting a Paris-aligned carbon quota for Ireland.

TI  - Hybrid seawater desalination-carbon capture using modified seawater battery system
AB  - The water and carbon cycles are central to the Earth's ecosystem, enabling the sustainable development of human societies. To mitigate the global issues of water shortages and climate change, we report a new electrochemical system that fulfills two functions-seawater desalination and carbon dioxide air-capture-during the charge and discharge processes. The seawater desalination-carbon capture system utilizes a seawater battery platform, consisting of three major compartments (desalination, sodium-collection, and carbon-capture), which are separated by sodium superionic conducting ceramic membranes. It is found that the concentrations of sodium ions and chloride ions in fresh seawater (total dissolved solids approximate to 34,000 ppm) are significantly decreased by the charging of the seawater desalination-carbon capture system, resulting in brackish water (total dissolved solids approximate to 7000 ppm). The discharge process induces the air-capture of ambient carbon dioxide gases through carbonation reactions, which is demonstrated by the carbon dioxide gas removal in this compartment. The hybrid system suggests a new electrochemical approach for both desalination and carbon capture.

TI  - Extraction of Salinity-Gradient Energy by a Hybrid Capacitive-Mixing System
AB  - Salinity-gradient energy (SGE) is a renewable energy source available wherever two solutions with different salinity mix. Capacitive-mixing (Capmix) is a technology that directly extracts the SG potential through the movements of ions in high- and low-concentration solutions. However, the energy-harvesting performance of Capmix needs further improvement. Herein, a hybrid Capmix that consists of a battery and capacitive electrodes is proposed. In this system, sodium ions and anions are captured/released by the metal oxide and carbon electrodes, respectively. The hybrid Capmix extracted an energy density that was approximately three times higher (130 J mâˆ’2) and exhibited a notable power output (97 mW mâˆ’2) compared to the previous Capmix using ion-exchange membranes. Furthermore, the hybrid system operated successfully with real river water and seawater. These results suggest that the hybrid Capmix could be a viable option to harvest energy from salinity gradients. Â© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

TI  - Long-term sea-level rise implied by 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C warming levels
AB  - Sea-level rise (SLR) is a critical and uncertain climate change risk, involving timescales of centuries(1). Here we use a semi-empirical model, calibrated with sea-level data of the past millennium(2), to estimate the SLR implications of holding warming below 2 degrees C or 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial temperature, as mentioned in the Cancun Agreements(3). Limiting warming to these levels with a probability larger than 50\% produces 75-80 cm SLR above the year 2000 by 2100. This is 25 cm below a scenario with unmitigated emissions, but 15 cm above a hypothetical scenario reducing global emissions to zero by 2016. The long-term SLR implications of the two warming goals diverge substantially on a multi-century timescale owing to inertia in the climate system and the differences in rates of SLR by 2100 between the scenarios. By 2300 a 1.5 degrees C scenario could peak sea level at a median estimate of 1.5 m above 2000. The 50\% probability scenario for 2 degrees C warming would see sea level reaching 2.7 m above 2000 and still rising at about double the present-day rate. Halting SLR within a few centuries is likely to be achieved only with the large-scale deployment of CO2 removal efforts, for example, combining large-scale bioenergy systems with carbon capture and storage(4).

TI  - Briefing: Geoengineering - Serious options to address climate change?
AB  - Geoengineering is the term used to describe environmental manipulation at a planetary scale. It is generally described as having two main categories: solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal, with an aim to reduce or neutralise the effects of climate change and global warming. Techniques include carbon capture and storage, fertilising the oceans and sunshields in space. The deployment of such technologies would present ethical challenges and potential environmental and social problems. As a species we have already manipulated and impacted on the environment and a key issue remains: it is not possible to predict all of the consequences of interventions in natural systems. If such technologies were to be deployed we would be 'locked-in' to cycles; we would be committed to trying to innovate and engineer solutions to new problems.

TI  - Developing Autonomous Observing Systems for Micronutrient Trace Metals
AB  - Trace metal micronutrients are integral to the functioning of marine ecosystems and the export of particulate carbon to the deep ocean. Although much progress has been made in mapping the distributions of metal micronutrients throughout the ocean over the last 30 years, there remain information gaps, most notable during seasonal transitions and in remote regions. The next challenge is to develop in situ sensing technologies necessary to capture the spatial and temporal variabilities of micronutrients characterized with short residence times, highly variable source terms, and sub-nanomolar concentrations in open ocean settings. Such an effort will allow investigation of the biogeochemical processes at the necessary resolution to constrain fluxes, residence times, and the biological and chemical responses to varying metal inputs in a changing ocean. Here, we discuss the current state of the art and analytical challenges associated with metal micronutrient determinations and highlight existing and emerging technologies, namely in situ chemical analyzers, electrochemical sensors, passive preconcentration samplers, and autonomous trace metal clean samplers, which could form the basis of autonomous observing systems for trace metals within the next decade. We suggest that several existing assets can already be deployed in regions of enhanced metal concentrations and argue that, upon further development, a combination of wet chemical analyzers with electrochemical sensors may provide the best compromise between analytical precision, detection limits, metal speciation, and longevity for autonomous open ocean determinations. To meet this goal, resources must be invested to: (1) improve the sensitivity of existing sensors including the development of novel chemical assays; (2) reduce sensor size and power requirements; (3) develop an open-source ``Do-It-Yourself{''} infrastructure to facilitate sensor development, uptake by end-users and foster a mechanism by which scientists can rapidly adapt commercially available technologies to in situ applications; and (4) develop a community-led standardized protocol to demonstrate the endurance and comparability of in situ sensor data with established techniques. Such a vision will be best served through ongoing collaborations between trace metal geochemists, analytical chemists, the engineering community, and commercial partners, which will accelerate the delivery of new technologies for in situ metal sensing in the decade following OceanObs'19.

TI  - A direct coupled electrochemical system for capture and conversion of CO2 from oceanwater
AB  - Capture and conversion of CO2 from oceanwater can lead to net-negative emissions and can provide carbon source for synthetic fuels and chemical feedstocks at the gigaton per year scale. Here, we report a direct coupled, proof-of-concept electrochemical system that uses a bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BPMED) cell and a vapor-fed CO2 reduction (CO2R) cell to capture and convert CO2 from oceanwater. The BPMED cell replaces the commonly used water-splitting reaction with one-electron, reversible redox couples at the electrodes and demonstrates the ability to capture CO2 at an electrochemical energy consumption of 155.4kJmol(-1) or 0.98 kWh kg(-1) of CO2 and a CO2 capture efficiency of 71\%. The direct coupled, vapor-fed CO2R cell yields a total Faradaic efficiency of up to 95\% for electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO. The proof-of-concept system provides a unique technological pathway for CO2 capture and conversion from oceanwater with only electrochemical processes. Isolating CO2 to use in electrochemical CO2 reduction systems is an ongoing issue. Here, the authors present a proof-of-concept integrated system combining a bipolar membrane electrodialysis cell with a vapor-fed CO2 reduction cell for capture and conversion of CO2 from oceanwater.

TI  - Economic evaluation of capture and sequestration of CO2 from Australian black coal-fired power stations
AB  - The technological options for the recovery and disposal/utilisation Of CO2 from coal-fired power stations have been extensively evaluated by the IEA Greenhouse Gas R\&D Programme, of which Australia is a member. However, there are many engineering and site-specific factors which must be addressed before the results of the largely generic IEA studies, and those of others, can be translated to Australian conditions to assess the potential for CO2 mitigation from local power stations. This paper reports results from a study that sought to translate these overseas studies to Australian black coal-fired power plants. A review of the technological options for recovering CO2 from coal-fired power plants indicates that retrofitting of a commercially available amine-based process is currently the best option. A detailed technical and economic analysis of this option was conducted for two black coal-fired power plants located at coastal and inland sites. The power stations, which had a net output of 500 MWe, were based on technology currently being applied in Australia. The CO2 recovered from the coastal station was ultimately disposed of in the ocean at a depth of 500 metres, 100 km offshore. For the inland station, the CO2 recovered was disposed of in a disused gas field at a depth of 2500 metres. The study determined the Cost Of CO2 removal and subsequent disposal, and assessed the impact of the processes on overall power plant efficiency. The effect of varying the SOX and NOX content of the flue gas prior to CO2 removal using commercially available retrofittable de-SOX and de-NOX technologies on the cost Was also assessed. The study has shown that the economics are greatly influenced by the extent to which the CO2 is removed. The results from this study have been compared with the impact of introducing Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) technology in Australia.

TI  - Carbon capture and high-capacity supercritical fluid processing with supersonic separator: Natural gas with ultra-high CO2 content
AB  - Some deep-water offshore fields produce oil with high gas/oil ratios and ultra-high %CO2 (&gt;60%mol) with the onus of processing low-grade gas simultaneously handling huge CO2 dispatch goals. Thus, processing solutions are needed to make feasible such high-capacity gas rigs hundreds of kilometers offshore. Feasibility relies on the choices for CO2 capture and adjustment of water and hydrocarbon dew-points of such high flow rate gas. This problem was approached adopting supersonic separators for dew-point adjustments and for CO2 capture on a floating-hub processing 50 MMsmÂ³/d of CO2 ultra-rich gas, reinjecting 96% of treated CO2-rich gas for enhanced oil recovery, while reserving 4% as fuel-gas after CO2 abatement to 20%mol for power production. Process alternatives were assessed in terms of power demand and profitability comparing supersonic separator with membrane-permeation for CO2 removal. Results show that 1st supersonic separator for dew-point adjustments of raw gas recycling condensate to the oil-gas-water separator and 2nd supersonic separator for CO2 removal avoiding CO2 freeze-out, give optimum net present value and minimum CO2 emissions. On one hand, these facts are consequences of less compressor investment as 2nd supersonic separator ejects pressurized CO2 condensate requiring 5% less compression power for enhanced oil recovery relatively to the power required by the low-pressure CO2-rich permeate from the membrane-permeation alternative. On the other hand, the best net value of supersonic separator alternative also reflects its highest revenues derived from recycling condensate from 1st supersonic separator entailing 18% higher oil production.

TI  - Supersonic separators for offshore processing of CO2-Rich natural gas: Comparison with conventional routes
AB  - This chapter implements the supersonic separator (SS) theory and modeling of Chap. 6 to real CO2-rich natural gas (NG) processing systems. To do this, four process alternatives for offshore conditioning of CO2-rich (44 mol%) NG are investigated. SS performances for water dew-point adjustment (WDPA), hydrocarbon dew-point adjustment (HCDPA), and CO2 capture are compared to conventional technologies, namely: WDPA by TEG absorption, HCDPA by Joule-Thomson expansion (JTE), and CO2 removal via membrane permeation (MP). Process alternatives are assessed in terms of power consumption and the following goal-attainments: lean NG with %CO2 â‰¤ 15%, sufficient for turboshaft power generation; low %CO2 LPG; and EOR fluid with %CO2 â‰¥ 75%. In terms of final gas quality, the best configuration was found to be the hybrid SS for WDPA/HCDPA and MP for CO2 removal, with lower footprint and lower power demand (-6.9%) relative to conventional process. SS for CO2 removal successfully reduced %CO2 from 44% to 21.85 mol%. Although less effective than MP, SS is a valid CO2 removal option producing fuel gas with 20 mol% CO2 suitable for turboshaft utilization. Moreover, CO2 is extracted from SS as a high-pressure liquid, allowing 44.5% reduction of power for CO2 separation/injection as EOR agent (corresponding to 30% of total power consumption).

TI  - Co2 rich natural gas processing: Technical, power consumption and emission comparisons of conventional and supersonic technologies
AB  - Supersonic separator is investigated via process simulation for treating CO2 rich (>40%) natural gas in terms of dew-points adjustment and CO2 removal for enhanced oil recovery. These applications are compared in terms of technical and energetic performances with conventional technologies, also comparing CO2 emissions by power generation. The context is that of an offshore platform to treat raw gas with 45%mol of CO2, producing a lean gas stream with maximum CO2 composition of â‰ˆ20%mol, suitable for use as fuel gas, and a CO2 rich stream that is compressed and injected to the oil and gas fields. The conventional process comprises dehydration by chemical absorption in TEG, Joule-Thomson expansion for C3+ removal, and membrane permeation for CO2 capture. The other alternatives use supersonic separation for dew-points adjustment, and membranes or another supersonic separation unit for CO2 capture. Simulations are carried out in HYSYS 8.8, where membranes and supersonic separation are modeled via unit operation extensions developed in a previous work: MP-UOE and SS-UOE. A full technical and power consumption analysis is performed for comparison of the three cases. The results show that the replacement of conventional dehydration technology by supersonic separators decreases power demand by 8.5%, consequently reducing 69.66 t/d of CO2 emitted to the atmosphere. The use of supersonic separation for CO2 capture is also superior than membranes, mainly due to the production of a high-pressure CO2 stream, that requires much less power for injection compression than the low-pressure permeate stream from membranes. Therefore, the case with two supersonic separator units in series presents the best results: lowest power demand (-23.9% than conventional case), directly impacting on CO2 emissions, which are reduced by 2598 t/d (-27.82%).

TI  - System Models of Sulfur-, Electricity-, and Methane-Powered Biological Carbon Capture for Negative Emissions
AB  - Nearly every plausible emission scenario that limits climate change to less than 2 Â°C includes net negative global emissions in the late 21st century. These negative emissions are achieved using negative emission technologies (NETs), a diverse class of currently theoretical technologies that use energy to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. While a number of technological options are available, many of the most promising CO2 capture systems take advantage of biological systems and are thus driven by light energy. Sulfur offers an alternative energy source for biological carbon capture. Herein, system models are presented that use reduced sulfur to power marine chemosynthetic carbon capture, with four proposed alternatives for the management of the produced biomass and sulfate. These four alternatives differ in the energy and process used to reduce the sulfate produced by the growth of the microorganisms back to sulfur or sulfide and in sum, the four systems create direct air carbon capture systems that utilize either geologic reduced sulfur, electricity, or biomass as energy sources. Thus, three new energy sources for direct air carbon capture are identified. Â© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

TI  - Screening, Monitoring, and Remediation of Legacy Wells to Improve Reservoir Integrity for Large-Scale CO2 Storageâ€”An Example From the Smeaheia Structure in the Northern North Sea
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is an inevitable action to achieve CO2 emission reduction targets including becoming net-zero by 2050. Increased efforts are therefore required to identify suitable locations for large-scale CO2 storage. In addition to large aquifers, shut down oil and gas fields in the North Sea are logical candidates for offshore large-scale CO2 storage because of their proven storage capacity, reliable caprock integrity, established infrastructure, and public acceptance. However, in some cases, old and legacy wells are subject to high uncertainties in their integrity, and they can compromise CO2 containment in such reservoirs. On the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS), such wells are numerous even outside of oil and gas production areas, i.e., legacy wells affecting aquifers. Therefore, there is a clear need for reliable and cost-effective technologies for well integrity evaluation and remediation. This paper discusses a workflow for screening, monitoring, and remediation of legacy wells. In a first stage, the screening of the Horda Platform areas suggested the need for integrity investigation for the exploration well 32/4-1 T2, drilled into the Alpha structure of the Smeaheia fault block if CO2 is stored in the structure. Our initial well screening of drilling documentation indicates that the well is not suitable to be reused for CO2 injection and geophysical monitoring is recommended. In a second stage, a numerical representation of the well architecture is built including realistic geological setting. We evaluate the sensitivity of non-invasive low-frequency electromagnetic monitoring to corrosion levels in the casing. Numerical end-member simulations of assuming casing corrosion of different degrees by changing material conductivity are performed. Results comparing different corrosion scenarios with a base case (no corrosion) give an above noise signal at receiver locations enabling to separate the different cases. Comparison of the gained electrical fields at seafloor suggests that well casing corrosion monitoring should be possible. Finally, the electrochemical deposition potential of the Sognefjord Formation water is analyzed, revealing depositional potential for portlandite, which might be useful for cement remediation. We recommend such an analysis for all legacy wells penetrating candidate reservoirs for future CO2 or hydrogen storage.

TI  - Carbon Capture and Storage Energy Consumption and Performance Optimization Using Metamodels and Response Surface Methodology
AB  - Oil and gas industries have high carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which is a great environmental concern. Monoethanolamine (MEA) is widely used as a solvent in CO2 capture and storage (CCS) systems. The challenge is that MEA-CCS itself is an energy-intensive process that requires optimum configuration and operation, and numerous design parameters and heat demands must be considered. Thus, the current work evaluates the energy distributions and CO2 removal efficiency of a CCS installed in floating production storage and offloading units under different operating conditions of a power and heat generation hub. The optimization procedures are implemented using highly accurate surrogate models for the following responses: (1) overall power consumption of CCS, (2) CCS separation performance, and (3) CCS heating and cooling demands. The input variables considered in the present research include the following: (1) the exhaust gas compositions and mass flowrate, (2) the operating pressure and temperature parameters of CCS and the injection compression unit, (3) the structural parameters of absorber and stripper columns, and (4) MEA solution parameters. The optimum CCS configuration significantly reduces the total heating and cooling demands by 62.77\% (7 x 10(6) kW) and the overall power consumption by 8.65\% (1.8 MW), and it increases the CCS separation performance by 4.46\% (97.46\%) and mitigates the CO2 emissions of proper CCS by 1.02 t/h compared with conventional operating conditions.

TI  - Capacitance-Assisted Sustainable Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Mineralisation
AB  - An electrochemical cell comprising a novel dual-component graphite and Earth-crust abundant metal anode, a hydrogen producing cathode and an aqueous sodium chloride electrolyte was constructed and used for carbon dioxide mineralisation. Under an atmosphere of 5 % carbon dioxide in nitrogen, the cell exhibited both capacitive and oxidative electrochemistry at the anode. The graphite acted as a supercapacitive reagent concentrator, pumping carbon dioxide into aqueous solution as hydrogen carbonate. Simultaneous oxidation of the anodic metal generated cations, which reacted with the hydrogen carbonate to give mineralised carbon dioxide. Whilst conventional electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction requires hydrogen, this cell generates hydrogen at the cathode. Carbon capture can be achieved in a highly sustainable manner using scrap metal within the anode, seawater as the electrolyte, an industrially relevant gas stream and a solar panel as an effective zero-carbon energy source.

TI  - Environmental impact of amines
AB  - The process of post combustion CO2-capture by chemical absorption relies on large scale use of chemicals, typically amines in aqueous solution. In such operations, emissions of amines may occur through the cleaned exhaust gas, as degraded solvent and as accidental spills. It is thus important that the chemicals used have low or no environmental effects. To check this, standard ecotoxicity and biodegradability tests for a marine environment were performed on more than 40 amines, including both solvents already in use for CO2-removal and new promising chemicals. The results form a database for environmental risk assessment of common absorption solvents and will be used to correlate chemical structure of the solvents to degradation and toxicity data for use in solvent screening. Some of the solvents used for carbon capture, have been shown to have low biodegradability. The tertiary amines which have been tested do not degrade easily, while the amino acids tested both have low toxicity and degrade easily. The fate estimation model EPI Suiteâ„¢[US EPA, Washington DC, USA] has also been used to estimate the biodegradation and toxicity of the chemicals. It was compared to the experimental results to investigate if this tool could be used for future solvent screening. For the biodegradability the predictions showed agreement with 48% of the tested compounds, while for ecotoxicity the predictions showed agreement with 66%. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Environmental control technology for atmospheric carbon dioxide
AB  - The impact of fossil-fuel use in the United States on worldwide CO2 emissions and the impact of increased coal utilization on CO2 emission rates are assessed. The aspects of CO2 control are discussed, as well as the available CO2 control points (CO2 removal sites). The primary factor affecting the practicability of a CO2 control system is the energy required by the control system. Of the three potential CO2 control points, removal from the stacks of fossil fuel power plants appears to require the least amount of energy. Estimates of the energy required to capture and recover CO2 from coal-fired power plant stacks by various processes are presented. Although capture and recovery of CO2 is an important consideration in the overall scheme of CO2 control, disposal or reuse of recovered CO2 may be the weakest link in the CO2 control chain. Of the several options considered, deep ocean storage appears to be the most promising. Two control scenarios are evaluated, one based on the absorption of CO2 contained in power plant flue gas by seawater; the other, based on absorption of CO2 by monoethanolamine (MEA). Captured CO2 is injected into the deep ocean in both cases. Our analyses indicate that capture and disposal by seawater is not feasible, whereas capture and disposal using MEA is a possibility. However, the economic penalties of CO2 control are significant; for example, at a CO2 removal efficiency of 50%, it is estimated that the power generation efficiency of a conventional coal-fired power plant would be reduced from 34% to about 25%. The cost of power generation would be expected to double. For 90% CO2 removal, power generation efficiency is reduced to between 15 and 6% and the cost of power generation increases by a factor of from 4 to 7. The use of non-fossil energy sources, such as nuclear or solar energy, to control the CO2 emissions resulting from fossil energy usage is not considered in this study. Â© 1980.

TI  - Design and Analysis of a Combined Rankine Cycle for Waste Heat Recovery of a Coal Power Plant Using LNG Cryogenic Exergy
AB  - In this study, a combined Rankine cycle was modeled and optimized. This process consists of a coal combustion unit, a steam cycle, a CO2 capture process, a gas conditioning process, and a CO2 organic Rankine cycle (ORC). This process is able to extract additional power without consuming additional fossil fuel by integrating the CO2-ORC with the steam cycle and a liquefied natural gas (LNG) evaporation process. Unlike conventional ORC, the CO2-ORC utilizes the low grade waste heat only for super heating of working fluid, while the main evaporation process is achieved by seawater. The CO2 condensation process in the ORC takes place at a temperature lower than the ambient temperature by coupling with the LNG evaporation system as a cold sink. Furthermore, a fraction of liquefied CO2 is purged for the sequestration. Therefore, CO2 liquefaction can be achieved without an additional refrigeration cycle. This process not only produces more power with the same fuel consumption but also reduces CO2 removal energy. The gross power is increased from 42.21 to 90.54 MWe compared with the conventional power plant, and total CO2 removal energy is decreased about 9\%. The optimum design and operating conditions were also obtained through parameter sensitivity analysis. The power reduction of the proposed process resulting due to the CO2 capture process installation was identified as 19.3\%. However, the net power generation is about 73\% higher than that of the conventional power cycle even without CO2 capture.

TI  - Modeling of Flowcharts of Permeation Through Membranes for Removal of CO2 of Natural Gas
AB  - In this present work, a simulator of permeation membranes is presented, the Permeation Membrane Simulator (PMS), which is based on rigorous engineering principles including sound thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer and mass transport. The use of hollow-fiber membrane units is studied in the context of CO2 removal from natural gas, which seems to be the preferred configuration in offshore plants. The feed stream is considered multi-component, with real chemical species, enabling reliable performance evaluations at different scenarios of pressure, temperature and composition of the gas to be treated by permeation. The resulting differential equations are solved along the characteristic contactor size: (i) steady state mass balances for the species present in each phase (L and V); (ii) momentum balances in each stationary phase; (iii) force balances in each phase. Major simplifications arise from adopting steady state and one-dimensional space over the membrane contactor. The process arrangements are based on recent studies concerning subsalt oil finds in the offshore Santos Basin, Brazil. A process flowsheet is simulated, comprising compressors and membrane modules, corresponding to a scenario of 4MMm(3)/d and 12\% mol CO2. The process is composed of three permeation and compression stages, producing one stream of commercial grade natural gas and another stream rich in CO2 for Carbon Capture \& Geological Storage - CCGS - purposes. Considering the simulation results of the scenarios presented, the application of membrane technology in offshore facilities is proven technically feasible.

TI  - Geoengineering: Basic science and ongoing research efforts in China
AB  - Geoengineering (also called climate engineering), which refers to large-scale intervention in the Earth's climate system to counteract greenhouse gas-induced warming, has been one of the most rapidly growing areas of climate research as a potential option for tackling global warming. Here, we provide an overview of the scientific background and research progress of proposed geoengineering schemes. Geoengineering can be broadly divided into two categories: solar geoengineering (also called solar radiation management, or SRM), which aims to reflect more sunlight to space, and carbon dioxide removal (CDR), which aims to reduce the CO2 content in the atmosphere. First, we review different proposed geoengineering methods involved in the solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal schemes. Then, we discuss the fundamental science underlying the climate response to the carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation management schemes. We focus on two basic issues: 1) climate response to the reduction in solar irradiance and 2) climate response to the reduction in atmospheric CO2. Next, we introduce an ongoing geoengineering research project in China that is supported by National Key Basic Research Program. This research project, being the first coordinated geoengineering research program in China, will systematically investigate the physical mechanisms, climate impacts, and risk and governance of a few targeted geoengineering schemes. It is expected that this research program will help us gain a deep understanding of the physical science underlying geoengineering schemes and the impacts of geoengineering on global climate, in particular, on the Asia monsoon region.

TI  - Renewable ammonia as an energy fuel for ocean exploration and transportation
AB  - Renewable power generated from ocean wave energy has faced technological and cost barriers that have hindered its penetration into utility-scale electricity markets. As an alternative, the production of chemical fuelsâ€”for example, ammonia (NH3), which has high energy density (11.5 MJ/L) and facile storage properties â€”may open wave energy to new markets including ocean exploration and transportation. Electrochemical synthesis of NH3 from air and water at ambient conditions has been studied and documented in the literature. Based on recent re-ports, it is possible to achieve an overall conversion efficiency of 10% from wave energy to NH3 by electrochemically reacting air and water. If all the 1170-TWh/year recoverable wave energy in the United States were used to produce renewable NH3 fuel as a replacement for hydrocarbon fuels, more than 250 million tons of CO2 emissions every year would be eliminated without accounting for the small amount of CO2 emission from the conversion of NH3. Several potential at-sea application scenarios have been proposed for renewable NH3 fuel including production and storage for marine shipping and seasonal energy storage for Arctic exploration. Liq-uefied NH3 has much higher energy density, both gravimetrically and volumetrically, than a variety of batteries; however, the energy efficiency of NH3 is lower than that of commonly used batteries such as Li-ion batteries. The levelized cost of storing NH3 prepared using electricity can be less than $0.2/kWh, and the storage time can exceed 10,000 h, which indicates that NH3 could be a promising energy-storage solution that makes use of abundant wave energy. However, safety and environmental concerns involved in the use of NH3 at sea exist and are identified and discussed in this paper. Also discussed are challenges regarding the electrocatalyst used for NH3 synthesis and how molecular simulation may help to screen electrocatalysts with high efficiency and selectivity.

TI  - Simulation of an Off-shore Natural Gas Purification Process for CO2 Removal with Gas-Liquid Contactors Employing Aqueous Solutions of Ethanolamines
AB  - Brazilian Pre-Salt oil reserves present associated natural gas (NG) exhibiting high concentrations of CO2 which requires gas purification processes for compliance with specifications imposed by the local Regulatory Agency. Due to its recognized small footprint as compared to amine based absorption route, membrane equipment show considerable potential for offshore applications. Of particular interest is the use of contactors, which combines membrane permeation with facilitated transport via liquid absorption. Process design and optimization of such innovative alternative demand flexible models to predict equipment performance at a variety of process conditions. This work presents a mathematical tool for analyzing CO2 separation with hollow-fiber membrane contactors, using aqueous solutions of ethanolamines. The model is applied to assess the technical feasibility of offshore CO2 separation with membrane contactors. The developed simulator is based on rigorous principles of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer and mass transport. Chemical absorption modeling is approached as a typical application of the well known Chemical Theory, which aims to model chemically and/or physically complex equilibrium systems via a set of chemical equilibrium processes involving real and fictitious species. Vapor-Liquid Equilibria of real species are superimposed on the multi-reaction chemical equilibria for formation of fictitious species - non-ionic and non-volatile complexes. A process flowsheet is simulated to assert technical feasibility of this technology to offshore installations.

TI  - Effect of seawater constituents on the performance of thermal spray aluminum in marine environments
AB  - Thermally sprayed coatings are often used to mitigate corrosion of offshore structures. They act as a physical barrier to the aggressive marine environment and as a sacrificial distributed anode for low carbon steel. In such environments, the severity of material degradation depends on many factors. The effect of temperature, exposure time or the presence of micro-organisms are the focus of many studies, for example, however, the effect of the different ions present in seawater remains largely unexplored. The chemical composition of the water changes considerably depending on the location; industrial, glacial, estuarine, and so forth. In addition, when thermal spray aluminum (TSA) protects steel in seawater, calcareous matter precipitates as a result of the cathodic polarization and subsequent localized increase in pH. Therefore, understanding how ions such as magnesium (II), calcium (II), or carbonates alter the coating properties in the marine environment is important. This paper reports the experimental work carried out with TSA-coated steel samples with defects to simulate mechanical damage or erosion of the coating. The combination of electrochemical tests and surface characterization provided evidence of the efficiency of the calcareous bilayer that forms on top of steel reducing the TSA degradation.

TI  - EMISSION-FREE FOSSIL ENERGY FROM NORWAY
AB  - The Norwegian policy regarding CO2 as a greenhouse gas is explained as a background for Statoils CO2-removal and -deposition activities. The planned deposition in a subsea aquifer of 1 million tons of CO2/year which will be removed from the Sleipner Vest offshore gas field is described. A brief description of the Norwegian R\&D activities with respect to CO2-removal and deposition is given. Several scenarios where CO2-free energy in the form of electricity or hydrogen is supplied to continental Europe or UK are discussed. It is concluded that CO2-removal and -deposition is a less expensive solution than the large scale application of renewable energy sources (other than hydropower) and probably also fusion energy. R\&D in the area of CO2-removal and -deposition is especially suited to international cooperation and burden sharing.

TI  - Energy-saving hydrogen production by chlorine-free hybrid seawater splitting coupling hydrazine degradation
AB  - Seawater electrolysis represents a potential solution to grid-scale production of carbon-neutral hydrogen energy without reliance on freshwater. However, it is challenged by high energy costs and detrimental chlorine chemistry in complex chemical environments. Here we demonstrate chlorine-free hydrogen production by hybrid seawater splitting coupling hydrazine degradation. It yields hydrogen at a rate of 9.2 mol h(-1) g(cat)(-1) on NiCo/MXene-based electrodes with a low electricity expense of 2.75 kWh per m(3) H-2 at 500 mA cm(-2) and 48\% lower energy equivalent input relative to commercial alkaline water electrolysis. Chlorine electrochemistry is avoided by low cell voltages without anode protection regardless Cl- crossover. This electrolyzer meanwhile enables fast hydrazine degradation to similar to 3 ppb residual. Self-powered hybrid seawater electrolysis is realized by integrating low-voltage direct hydrazine fuel cells or solar cells. These findings enable further opportunities for efficient conversion of ocean resources to hydrogen fuel while removing harmful pollutants.

TI  - CO2 budget of cultured mussels metabolism in the highly productive Northwest Iberian upwelling system
AB  - Assessing the carbon footprint of marine bivalve aquaculture demands an accurate estimation of the CO2 release associated to capital goods and aquaculture operations but also to the metabolic CO2 budget of the cultured species. Nowadays, there are discrepancies on the processes to include in that budget, how to estimate them, and which scale should be applied, from individual to ecosystem. Site-specific environmental conditions and culture methods also affect significantly the estimates. Here, we have gathered environmental, biochemical and metabolic data from published scientific articles, reports and existing databases to present the metabolic CO2 budget for mussel aquaculture in the coastal inlets of the Northwest Iberian upwelling. We analyse the contribution of mussel flesh and shell production jointly and separately. At the individual scale, the shell CO2 budget is estimated from CO2 removal by shell matrix protein synthesis and CO2 release during calcification and respiration to support shell maintenance. Organic carbon in mussel flesh and CO2 released by respiration to support flesh maintenance contribute to the flesh CO2 budget. Only calcification and respiration processes are considered when estimating the metabolic carbon footprint of individual mussels because organic carbon in mussel flesh and shell returns to the atmosphere as CO2 in a relatively short period. While the metabolic carbon footprint associated to mussel shell remains constant at 365 kg CO2 per ton of shell, it varies from 92 to 578 kg CO2 per ton of mussel flesh. This large variability depends on mussel seeding time and harvesting size, due to the differential seasonal growth patterns of flesh and shell. Inclusion of the CO2 potentially immobilised in mussel faeces buried in the sediments would lead to a reduction of the metabolic carbon footprint estimates by up to 6 % compared with the individual estimates.

TI  - Selective microbial electrosynthesis of methane by a pure culture of a marine lithoautotrophic archaeon
AB  - Reduction of carbon dioxide to methane by microorganisms attached to electrodes is a promising process in terms of renewable energy storage strategies. However the efficient and specific electrosynthesis of methane by methanogenic archaea on cathodes needs fundamental investigations of the electron transfer mechanisms at the microbe-electrode interface without the addition of artificial electron mediators. Using well-defined electrochemical techniques directly coupled to gas chromatography and surface analysis by scanning electron microscopy, it is shown that a pure culture of the marine lithoautotrophic Methanobacterium-like archaeon strain IM1 is capable to utilize electrons from graphite cathodes for a highly selective production of methane, without hydrogen serving as a cathode-generated electron carrier. Microbial electrosynthesis of methane with cultures of strain IM1 is achieved at a set potential of -0.4V vs. SHE and is characterized by a coulomb efficiency of 80\%, with rates reaching 350 nmol d(-1) cm(-2) after 23 days of incubation. Moreover, potential step measurements reveal a biologically catalyzed hydrogen production at potentials more positive than abiotic hydrogen evolution on graphite, indicating that an excessive supply of electrons to strain IM1 results in proton reduction rather than in a further increase of methane production.

TI  - Hybrid photoelectrochemical-rechargeable seawater battery for efficient solar energy storage systems
AB  - Eco-friendly harnessing of both ocean chemical energy and solar energy would represent a sustainable solution for future energy conversion/storage systems, but it has been challenging to enhance the energy efficiency of such systems for practical applications. Here, we demonstrate an efficient photoelectrochemical-assisted rechargeable seawater battery. By integrating TiO2 nanostructure-based photoelectrodes with the seawater battery, we achieved significant enhancement of the voltage efficiency during the charging/discharging processes; effective photocharging with the TiO2 photoanode reduced the charging voltage to similar to 2.65 V, while the heated carbon felt (HCF) cathode in the seawater battery exhibited charging/discharging voltages of similar to 3.8 V and similar to 2.9 V, respectively. Such a charging voltage reduction led to a voltage efficiency of similar to 109\%. Moreover, interestingly, we found that TiO2 nanostructures showed excellent photoelectrochemical performances in seawater in association with the efficient photocharging. As a result, the utilization of TiO2 nanostructures as photocharging/discharging electrodes provides a feasible strategy to optimize the cell configuration for highly efficient solar seawater batteries.

TI  - Metal-based nanomaterials for efficient CO2 electroreduction: Recent advances in mechanism, material design and selectivity
AB  - Increasing global demands for energy supply have accelerated fossil fuel consumption, triggering a gradual increase in atmospheric CO2, leading to adverse environmental effects of global warming, desertification and ocean acidification. Thus, reducing carbon emissions to mitigate climate change is an urgent imperative. Among several feasible strategies, electrochemical reduction of CO2 into value-added feedstocks is a promising one since such processes can be integrated with renewable electricity and powered by intermittent energy sources: wind, solar and hydro among others. The efficiency of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and its resulting economic feasibility strongly depends on the intrinsic properties of catalyst used. Several approaches have been proposed to attain high electrocatalytic performance of heterogenous electrocatalysts by controlling their size, morphology, surface defects, grain boundaries and crystal facets and by coupling with other synergistic components to synthesize nanocomposites, e.g., metallic alloys or metal/carbon-based nanomaterials. This review presents the latest achievements with metal-based nanomaterials for efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, their mechanism of action, and promising applications in selective conversions valuable chemicals/fuels, including carbon monoxide, formic acid, hydrocarbons and alcohols.

TI  - Design keys of a recent recirculating facility built in Chile operating with fluidized bed biofilters
AB  - The fast evolution of recirculation systems for salmonids has challenged the engineering companies to develop new and better design and engineering practices, to improve the water quality and system flexibility. One of the major factors that affect the water quality parameters is the total suspended solids produced within the system. The design of water flow from the water inlet into the culture tank down to the effluent pipeline and the water filtration unit, will determine a system's performance. Two recirculating systems for 250 and 1500 m3 have been designed and built applying specific design keys focused in good solids removal, system removal exchange, piping size and layout, filtration process, biofiltration units, gas balancing and CO2 removal, oxygenation devices, and disinfection process. All these treatments have been designed and built for both facilities, and they are currently operating with very good results. Both facilities are in separate isolated buildings but in the same hatchery site. They share a common heat pump unit that delivers chilled water to the incubation room, and the makeup water is from several wells on site.

TI  - Ecosystem impacts of geoengineering: A review for developing a science plan
AB  - Geoengineering methods are intended to reduce climate change, which is already having demonstrable effects on ecosystem structure and functioning in some regions. Two types of geoengineering activities that have been proposed are: carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (CDR), which removes CO2 from the atmosphere, and solar radiation management (SRM, or sunlight reflection methods), which reflects a small percentage of sunlight back into space to offset warming from greenhouse gases (GHGs). Current research suggests that SRM or CDR might diminish the impacts of climate change on ecosystems by reducing changes in temperature and precipitation. However, sudden cessation of SRM would exacerbate the climate effects on ecosystems, and some CDR might interfere with oceanic and terrestrial ecosystem processes. The many risks and uncertainties associated with these new kinds of purposeful perturbations to the Earth system are not well understood and require cautious and comprehensive research.

TI  - In situ remediation of contaminated marine sediment: an overview
AB  - Sediment tends to accumulate inorganic and persistent hydrophobic organic contaminants representing one of the main sinks and sources of pollution. Generally, contaminated sediment poses medium-and long-term risks to humans and ecosystem health; dredging activities or natural resuspension phenomena (i.e., strongly adverse weather conditions) can remobilize pollution releasing it into the water column. Thus, ex situ traditional remediation activities (i.e., dredging) can be hazardous compared to in situ techniques that try to keep to a minimum sediment mobilization, unless dredging is compulsory to reach a desired bathymetric level. We reviewed in situ physico-chemical (i.e., active mixing and thin capping, solidification/stabilization, chemical oxidation, dechlorination, electrokinetic separation, and sediment flushing) and bio-assisted treatments, including hybrid solutions (i.e., nanocomposite reactive capping, bioreactive capping, microbial electrochemical technologies). We found that significant gaps still remain into the knowledge about the application of in situ contaminated sediment remediation techniques from the technical and the practical viewpoint. Only activated carbon-based technologies are well developed and currently applied with several available case studies. The environmental implication of in situ remediation technologies was only shortly investigated on a long-termbasis after its application, so it is not clear how they can really perform.

TI  - Large-Scale Carbon Dioxide Removal to Meet the 1.5 degrees C Limit: Key Governance Gaps, Challenges and Priority Responses
AB  - Parties to the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement have agreed to pursue efforts to limit the global average temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C. To meet this goal, the international community will have to aggressively reduce emissions and also remove CO2 from the atmosphere on an unprecedented scale, through an array of biological and technical Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) options. This paper considers governance challenges that arise from the need to rely on CDR to meet the Paris Agreement's long-term temperature goal. It looks at how heavy this reliance may have to be, over what timeframe, involving what options and, crucially, how best to ensure that CDR does not, while trying to address one problem, create many other challenges for sustainable development. After identifying the potential scale and pace of CO2 removal needed to meet the 1.5 degrees C goal, we identify key governance gaps and challenges that arise from large-scale CDR implementation and propose a series of policy responses to be addressed by policy makers as a matter of priority, to enable CDR to contribute to 1.5 degrees C-consistent pathways at the scale and pace required.

TI  - Modeling of gasâ€“liquid flow in a rotating packed bed using an Eulerian multi-fluid approach
AB  - Rotating packed beds (RPBs) are ideal candidates for CO2 removal from offshore natural gas due to their good mass transfer performance and significant volume savings. This article proposes an Eulerian multi-fluid approach to simulate the gasâ€“liquid flow in RPBs. Three new multiphase drag force models are constructed based on single-phase drag force models for wire mesh packings. Based on the Eulerian multi-fluid approach, a new RPB simulation framework is developed. The predicted results using the new simulation framework with the new drag force models are compared with the experimental data. When using the KoÅ‚odziej model and the modified KoÅ‚odziej model, the predicted overall liquid holdup shows good agreement with the experimental data with errors less than 20%. In addition, the pressure drop predicted by these three models are reasonable compared with the experimental data. This work lays a foundation for RPB simulation of gasâ€“liquid flow using Eulerian multi-fluid approach. Â© 2022 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

TI  - Analysis and integration of fuel cell combined cycles for development of low-carbon energy technologies

The paper analyses the further integration of high-temperature fuel cells (FC) having high electrical efficiency reaching up to 60% compared with 30-35% for most gas turbines.

TI  - CO2 removal membrane technology recent developments
AB  - Membrane systems have become a tried and accepted natural gas treating technology with distinct advantages in a variety of processing applications. From the earliest units producing below 10 MM SCFD treated gas, systems are now in place to produce upward of 250 MM SCFD. Plans for plants producing 500 MM SCFD and higher are in the works. Although most units have been installed onshore, some offshore facilities do exist, and many more are planned. These systems, as well as those in the Middle East and elsewhere, exploit the reliability and minimum manpower requirements of membranes. Some early installations highlighted the need for suitable pre-processing prior to membrane treatment. This need has led to the development of a robust and comprehensive pre-treatment scheme that ensures extended membrane life. This pre-treatment, in combination with the continuing development of advanced membranes, has even further enhanced the reliability and performance of membrane technology and made it the CO2 removal technology of choice in a variety of processing conditions. This paper describes operating experiences and design philosophy for larger membrane-based CO2 removal plants.

TI  - Harvesting electrical energy from carbon nanotube yarn twist
AB  - Mechanical energy harvesters are needed for diverse applications, including self-powered wireless sensors, structural and human health monitoring systems, and the extraction of energy from ocean waves. We report carbon nanotube yarn harvesters that electrochemically convert tensile or torsional mechanical energy into electrical energy without requiring an external bias voltage. Stretching coiled yarns generated 250 watts per kilogram of peak electrical power when cycled up to 30 hertz, as well as up to 41.2 joules per kilogram of electrical energy per mechanical cycle, when normalized to harvester yarn weight. These energy harvesters were used in the ocean to harvest wave energy, combined with thermally driven artificial muscles to convert temperature fluctuations to electrical energy, sewn into textiles for use as self-powered respiration sensors, and used to power a light-emitting diode and to charge a storage capacitor.

TI  - The early evolution of climate engineering research
AB  - The emerging climate engineering (CE) debate will be fed by scientific information-and likely by misinformation as well. The first intense, international studies of any type of CE began in the early 1990s with ocean iron fertilisation, a method associated with the carbon dioxide removal branch of CE techniques. The ocean fertilisation experiments and analyses led to discussions by scientists and stakeholders about not only the environmental advantages and disadvantages but also political and ethical concerns. While a major part of the future evolution of CE research will extend on some of the trajectories outlined above, especially the expansion of community-wide multi-model studies, a highly uncertain direction of development involves future field testing of CE. Many CE studies have already been published in the separate disciplines, with only a few interdisciplinary studies so far, and even less trans-disciplinary work.

TI  - Extaction of Maximum Power from PV and Wind Energy Sources Using Predictive Control System in Microgrids
AB  - The impact of global warming and changing climatic conditions due to over exploitation of fossil fuels, emission of high carbon levels and increased demand for energy have necessitated the application of renewable energy sources. Load demand is addressed by the default design of microgrids, with minimal changes in their architecture to adhere the introduction of electricity generated from different renewable sources. Renewable energy sources are generated from photovoltaic cells (solar), wind, ocean tides and India has been extending the deployment of solar and wind energy generation centres. The proposed system concentrates over the algorithms for Maximum Power Point tracking schemes to analyse how the renewable sources of energy are used to yield the maximum power. The same energy is stored in a battery storage and hence used whenever necessary. A definite set of control measures are defined within the Model Predictive Controlling mechanism, enabled to control the inverters, further defined to address the requirements of consistent AC load voltages. The inverters are controlled through a novel design of DC-DC Buck Boost Converter of battery and Model Predictive Controller is facilitated with DC-AC inverters. The controllers are modelled with MATLAB/SIMULINK with power droop controllers within the microgrid system. Proposed system was evaluated through simulations and from the investigative results, predictive controlling scheme has outperformed the other control strategies while handling the fluctuating PV and wind energy sources.

TI  - Strategy for pre-combustion removal of carbon dioxide from hydrocarbon-fueled power plants
AB  - A process based on existing technologies has been devised to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from industrial-scale combustors burning hydrocarbon fuels. In this process, carbon is extracted from the fuel in a catalytic steam reformer prior to combustion. This is a departure from earlier proposals which pursued removal of CO2 from post-flame gases. The fuel is reformed into a gas mixture comprising CO2, H2, excess water vapor, and residual hydrocarbons. The carbon dioxide is separated by preferential absorption into a recyclable liquid solvent followed by desorption from the liquid in a lower pressure regeneration tower. The hydrogen gas is burned in place of the original hydrocarbon fuel. Containment of the separated CO2 is accomplished by liquefaction and discharge into the deep ocean where local conditions prevent it from resurfacing and escaping into the atmosphere. A thermoeconomic analysis of a 500 MW, methane-fired, steam power plant fitted with the pre-combustion CO2 removal system indicates moderate cost and energy penalties.

TI  - Optimisation CO2 removal design for block B-17 in the MTJDA wy
AB  - Nine gas fields have been discoved in Block B-17 in the Malaysia-Thailand Joint Devepment Area (MTJDA). Most of them have high CO2 content which makes the gas unmarketable. To achieve the commerciality, CO2 content needs to be reduce to the level that the existing market is able to accept the Block B-17 gas. Under the GSA-HOA which had been signed in 1999 between Buyers and Sellers, it had specified the CO2 content not more than 23 mole%. Therefore, the Sellers need to design the gas processing facilities to meet the requirement of Buyers. Generally, the value of sales gas is based on its heating value, not volume. The high CO2 content means the less heating value resulting the less revenue. Therefore, the Sellers must reduce the CO2 content in sales gas as low as possible. Paradoxically, the more removal of CO2 content in sales gas does not indicate the best economic results, due to the high investment cost. To optimise the project economic, the percentage of CO2 content has to define under the specification of GSA-HOA and economical consideration of the project. Several factors, for instance, gas compositions, reserves, well deliverability, need to be taken into the account of the processing design. In order to achieve the maximum benefit, the CO2 removal optimisation has to be properly designed. This paper will present a model which describes the relationship between values of sales gas and the CO2 removal cost resulting in i) good economical regime with available raw gas quality in the Joint Development Area (JDA), and ii) raw gas mixture for optimum sales gas heating value which relates to economic design of the CO2 removal.

TI  - Seasonal Water Mass Evolution and Non-Redfield Dynamics Enhance CO2 Uptake in the Chukchi Sea
AB  - The Chukchi Sea is an increasing CO2 sink driven by rapid climate changes. Understanding the seasonal variation of air-sea CO2 exchange and the underlying mechanisms of biogeochemical dynamics is important for predicting impacts of climate change on and feedbacks by the ocean. Here, we present a unique data set of underway sea surface partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and discrete samples of biogeochemical properties collected in five consecutive cruises in 2014 and examine the seasonal variations in air-sea CO2 flux and net community production (NCP). We found that thermal and non-thermal effects have different impacts on sea surface pCO(2) and thus the air-sea CO2 flux in different water masses. The Bering summer water combined with meltwater has a significantly greater atmospheric CO2 uptake potential than that of the Alaskan Coastal Water in the southern Chukchi Sea in summer, due to stronger biological CO2 removal and a weaker thermal effect. By analyzing the seasonal drawdown of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and nutrients, we found that DIC-based NCP was higher than nitrate-based NCP by 66\%-84\% and attributable to partially decoupled C and N uptake because of a variable phytoplankton stoichiometry. A box model with a non-Redfield C:N uptake ratio can adequately reproduce observed pCO(2) and DIC, which reveals that, during the intensive growing season (late spring to early summer), 30\%-46\% CO2 uptake in the Chukchi Sea was supported by a flexible stoichiometry of phytoplankton. These findings have important ramification for forecasting the responses of CO2 uptake of the Chukchi ecosystem to climate change.

TI  - Numerical cell model investigating cellular carbon fluxes in Emiliania huxleyi
AB  - Coccolithophores play a crucial role in the marine carbon cycle and thus it is interesting to know how they will respond to climate change. After several decades of research the interplay between intracellular processes and the marine carbonate system is still not well understood. On the basis of experimental findings given in literature, a numerical cell model is developed that describes inorganic carbon fluxes between seawater and the intracellular sites of calcite precipitation and photosynthetic carbon fixation. The implemented cell model consists of four compartments, for each of which the carbonate system is resolved individually. The four compartments are connected to each other via H+, CO2, and HCO3- fluxes across the compartment-confining membranes. For CO2 accumulation around RubisCO, an energy-efficient carbon concentrating mechanism is proposed that relies on diffusive CO2 uptake. At low external CO2 concentrations and high light intensities, CO2 diffusion does not suffice to cover the carbon demand of photosynthesis and an additional uptake of external HCO3- becomes essential. The model is constrained by data of Emiliania huxleyi, the numerically most abundant coccolithophore species in the present-day ocean. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Offshore processing of CO2 rich natural gas with supersonic separator versus conventional routes
AB  - The supersonic separator (SS) was investigated for treating humid natural gas with 44\%mol CO2 in offshore rigs and compared to the conventional Water Dew Point Adjustment (WDPA) via TEG Absorption, Hydrocarbon Dew Point Adjustment (HCDPA) via Joule-Thomson Expansion (JTE) and CO2 removal via Membrane Permeation (MP). SS was tested as a single-step operation for WDPA HCDPA. To simulate SS and MP, two Unit Operation Extensions (UOE) were developed for simulator HYSYS 8.8 (AspenTech). MP-UOE uses an empirical approach calibrated with operation data, whereas SS-UOE is entirely funded on thermodynamics, not demanding calibration. MP-UOE and SS-UOE use the thermodynamic infrastructure of HYSYS: property packages and several proved multiphase flash algorithms. MP-UOE and SS-UOE performed accordingly the expected characteristics of the respective operations and were critical to accomplish this analysis as SS and MP are not available in simulators. In terms of final gas quality (WDP <= -45 degrees C @1.01 bar, HCDP <= 0 degrees C @45 bar, \%CO2 <= 15\%mol) the best process configuration was found to be a hybrid one: SS WDPA HDPA and MP CO2 removal, with low footprint and low power demand (-6.9\%) relative to conventional 3-step way. If used for CO2 removal, SS could abate CO2 from 44\% to 21.85\%mol. Albeit less effective than MP, SS CO2 removal is a noticeable option that produces fuel gas for power generation with \%CO2 approximate to 20\% as required by new turbo-shafts. Moreover, CO2 is withdrawn from SS as a pumpable liquid allowing a cut of 44\% in the power demanded for CO2 separation and injection as EOR agent. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Biomass-derived carbon material as efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction
AB  - Despite the abundance of carbon in nature, a significant portion of the existing biomass carbon materials in livestock, agriculture, and marine fishery industry are currently being wasted. Utilizing sustainable carbon materials as an alternative to noble Pt-based catalysts is crucial step to convert widely available and low-cost biomass resources into clean energy systems. Therefore, the rational synthesis of carbon-based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has become a hot research focus in the field of electrochemistry. In this study, the recent progress in the synthesis of ORR electrocatalysts using sustainable biomass resources was reviewed; the activation and synthesis strategies of various biomass resources, as well as the microstructure and oxygen reduction performance of the prepared carbon-based catalysts were investigated. It is hoped that this review article will promote the understanding of various parameters from biomass as precursors for catalyst preparation and make contribute to the transition of biomass resources from the wasted carbon materials to the main cat-alysts in future energy devices.

TI  - Impact of Solar Radiation Modification on Allowable CO2 Emissions: What Can We Learn From Multimodel Simulations?
AB  - Solar radiation modification (SRM) is known to strengthen both land and ocean carbon uptake because of its impacts on surface temperature, solar radiation, and other potential drivers of the global carbon cycle. However, the magnitude and timing of the response of both land and ocean carbon uptake to SRM and its consequence on allowable CO2 emissions remain poorly understood. Here we use the results of six Earth system models simulating a continuous stratospheric injection of 5 Tg of sulfur dioxide per year between 2020 and 2069 under the representative concentration pathways 4.5 to investigate the impact of SRM on land and ocean carbon uptake. We find that 50 years of SRM under this protocol increases the allowable CO2 emissions by 40 +/- 19 GtC; 85\% of this additional uptake of carbon is stored in the land biosphere and 15\% in the ocean. This increase in allowable CO2 emissions is however not sustainable after the stoppage of SRM. Earth system models predict a mean release of 8 +/- 11 GtC of the carbon back to the atmosphere 20 years after the stoppage which is dominated by large uncertainties in the response of the simulated land carbon cycle to rising temperature and solar radiation. We demonstrate that the time scales of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) potential of SRM are smaller than the time scales of the geological storage assumed in well-established CDR options. This shows that the CDR potential of SRM should be compared to well-established CDR options with caution.

TI  - Development of an Electrochemical Acidification Cell for the Recovery of CO2 and H-2 from Seawater
AB  - Based on continuous electrodeionization (CEDI) technology, a novel hybrid electrochemical acidification process has been developed to extract large quantities of CO2 from seawater. This indirect approach acidifies seawater to recover CO2 from bicarbonate. The electrolytic regeneration of cation exchange resin allowed simultaneous and continuous ion exchange and regeneration to occur within the cell along with control of the seawater pH. Lowering seawater pH was found to be proportional to the applied current to the cell, and the CO2 in the acidified seawater was readily removed at pH less than 6.0. In addition, the cell produced a portion of hydrogen gas without additional energy penalties.

AB  - The corrosion behavior of API 5L X65 carbon steel was Investigated under high pressure CO2 environments, containing small amounts of H 2S, to simulate the conditions of high CO2 containing natural gas transporting offshore pipeline in Malaysia. It was systematically studied under high pressure CO2 (ranging from 80 to 120 bars) with variation in other key parameters (temperature, water partitioning, and H 2S concentration). The corrosion rates were measured using the techniques such as linear polarization resistance (LPR), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and weight loss (WL). The surface morphology and the composition of the corrosion product layers were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that in the water-rich phase, the addition of 200 ppm H2S instantaneously decreased the corrosion rate of API 5L X65 at both 25Â°C and 80Â°C (120 bar).

TI  - Liquid-solid triboelectric nanogenerators array and its applications for wave energy harvesting and self-powered cathodic protection
AB  - A new type of array combination for liquid-solid triboelectric nanogenerators is constructed by using polytetrafluoroethylene ultrafiltration membrane as the friction layer with water to collect wave energy to self-power the cathodic protection system in marine environment. The dual liquid-solid triboelectric nanogenerator array shows the output performance with a short current circuit of 2.68 mA and output voltage of 105 V. Meanwhile, a self-powered corrosion protection system with liquid-solid triboelectric nanogenerators array as the power supply is achieved for A3 carbon steel in 3.5 wt\% NaCl solution. The electrochemical measurements results show that compared with the bare carbon steel, the open circuit potential drop of the carbon steel coupled with the liquid-solid triboelectric nanogenerators is about 330 mV. Compared with photocathodic protection and other new energy-based methods, the solid-liquid triboelectric nanogenerator could realize all-weather protection of metals by utilizing natural energy and through parallel or series circuit design, it could be used to achieve more efficient cathodic protection for metal materials. The intelligent self-powered system possesses great potential in the area of all-weather cathodic protection and power supply by utilizing liquid-solid friction energy for the ships, buoys, and marine equipments in ocean conditions.

TI  - Electrochemical graphitization in the molten salts: Progress and prospects [ç†”ç›ç”µåŒ–å­¦çŸ³å¢¨åŒ–ç ”ç©¶è¿›å±•åŠå±•æœ›]
AB  - In 2020, the Chinese government proposed the goals of "peaking carbon dioxide emissions" in 2030 and reaching "carbon neutrality" in 2060, with the expectation of enhancing the optimization of industrial structure and energy structures as well as promoting the development of control technologies and new energy technologies for pollution prevention. Carbon emissions lead to global warming, glacier melting, sea level rising, and other unexpected climate changes. It is highly significant to develop sustainable technologies for treating or converting carbon dioxide and low value-added solid carbon wastes and other carbon pollutants to achieve solid-state valuable carbon products. Carbon pollutants are also regarded as secondary carbon resources, which provide sufficient raw materials for developing carbon materials. Graphitization alters the chemical structure of carbonaceous materials. However, there are still some critical issues in the traditional graphitization processes, such as high processing temperature, insufficient graphitization, and emission of greenhouse gas. In recent years, an efficient and environmentally friendly method for electrochemical graphitization in molten salts has been established, which can be used to directly convert carbon pollutants into high graphitized products. In this review, there are three main topics: (1) process flow, (2) structure characteristics, (3) conversion mechanism of electrochemical graphitization. The use of carbon nanomaterials in secondary batteries such as lithium-ion batteries and aluminum-ion batteries has been discussed for a potential application. As a result, the efficient strategies of transforming and utilizing abundant secondary carbon resources to achieve the applications have also been analyzed. Finally, the ultimate goals for bridging the gap between molten salt electrochemical graphitization and engineering of graphitized products have been identified. Further efforts should be made to develop large-scale electrolytic technology with low energy consumption, build advanced in-situ characterization technology and quantitative analysis method for high-temperature molten salt electrochemistry, and understand the mechanism of electrochemical graphitization at the microscale.

TI  - The Science of Geoengineering
AB  - Carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of coal, oil, and gas are increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. These increased concentrations cause additional energy to be retained in Earth's climate system, thus increasing Earth's temperature. Various methods have been proposed to prevent this temperature increase either by reflecting to space sunlight that would otherwise warm Earth or by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Such intentional alteration of planetary-scale processes has been termed geoengineering. The first category of geoengineering method, solar geoengineering (also known as solar radiation management, or SRM), raises novel global-scale governance and environmental issues. Some SRM approaches are thought to be low in cost, so the scale of SRM deployment will likely depend primarily on considerations of risk. The second category of geoengineering method, carbon dioxide removal (CDR), raises issues related primarily to scale, cost, effectiveness, and local environmental consequences. The scale of CDR deployment will likely depend primarily on cost.

TI  - Landfill leachate and municipal wastewater co-treatment in microbial fuel cell integrated unsaturated and partially saturated tidal flow constructed wetlands
AB  - This study co-treated landfill leachate and municipal wastewater employing unsaturated, partially saturated microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands. The wetland systems were packed with organic or waste materials and planted with Phragmites australis. Leachate and municipal wastewater were mixed in different volumetric proportions (40%: 60%; 20%: 80%; 10%: 90%) for co-treatment under variable wastewater retention periods (i.e., 6 and 24 h). Mean biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, ammonium nitrogen, total nitrogen, phosphorus removal percentage ranged between âˆ’35 and 76%, âˆ’22 and 76%, 10 and 90%, âˆ’0.2 and 71%, 38 and 92%, respectively. The combination of higher influent pollutants load (due to higher leachate volumetric proportion in the mixed wastewater) and longer retention time developed a predominant anoxic/anaerobic environment inside the media of the unsaturated, partially saturated microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow wetlands. Such environmental conditions diminished organic and nutrient removal by hampering electrochemically active, other removal pathways, particularly in partially saturated wetlands. Leachate volumetric proportion reduction adjusted the influent's pollutant loads, carbon and other chemical composition, increased aerobic gradient inside the media bed, and improved pollutants removal of the unsaturated, partially saturated systems. A longer wastewater retention period supplemented operational performance. Mean voltage production across the microbial fuel cell integrated tidal flow constructed wetlands ranged between 4 and 152 mV; maximum power density production ranged between 50 and 527 mW/m3. Physicochemical properties (voids, roughness, carbon composition) of the media influenced power density production. Waste rubber tire material-based partially saturated wetland was the most efficient bioenergy producing system. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Membrane-solvent selection for CO2 removal using membrane gas-liquid contactors
AB  - Membrane gas-liquid contactors can provide very high interfacial area per unit volume, independent regulation of gas and liquid flows and are insensitive to module orientation, which make them very attractive in comparison with conventional equipments for offshore application, However, the membrane adds an additional resistance in the process of mass transfer. The mass transfer resistance of the membrane is affected by the presence of the liquid inside the membrane pores. This wetting of the membrane is determined by the properties of the membrane and the liquid mutually. Hence, a proper choice of the membrane-solvent combination is a critical and determining step in developing membrane gas absorption processes. Important criteria for the selection of the membrane-solvent combination for membrane gas-liquid contactors, such as the critical entry pressure, contact angle and critical solvent surface tension are evaluated in this paper. These characterizing properties of membranes and solvents are experimentally measured for various membrane and solvent combinations for the case of bulk CO2 removal. For selected combinations the actual gas-liquid mass transfer process for CO2 absorption is explored experimentally in the flat sheet as well as in the hollow fiber membrane configuration. The experimental results were compared to the theoretical calculations to determine possible mass transfer limitations due to wetting effects. The polypropylene membrane in combination with propylene carbonate as an absorption liquid was found to be a suitable combination for bulk CO2 removal using membrane gas-liquid contactors.

TI  - Integrated membrane technology for the removal of multiple components
AB  - Membrane systems have become an accepted means to remove carbon dioxide from natural gas, with the first commercial systems for glassy type membranes installed in the 1980's. More recently, rubbery membranes have been commercially proven for the removal of heavy hydrocarbons as well as to dehydrate and remove hydrogen sulfide from natural gas. Since traditional glassy membranes can be damaged by heavy hydrocarbons or water condensation in treating wellhead gas, the inherent simplicity of glassy membranes can be lost due to the need for complex pretreatment. Marrying rubbery membranes to remove heavy hydrocarbons and water prior to glassy membranes for carbon dioxide removal simplifies the process train and removes multiple impurities in a single unit. Due to size, weight and cost considerations, such an approach is attractive for offshore applications and has recently been commercialized at two onshore sites. This paper reviews the membrane technology principles and its applications in natural gas processing, and briefly presents the operation of the two sites utilizing integrated rubbery and glassy membranes.

TI  - Federal research, development, and demonstration priorities for carbon dioxide removal in the United States
AB  - Atmospheric carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies may be critical to achieving deep decarbonization. Yet a lack of technical and commercial maturity of CDR technologies hinders potential deployment. Needs for commercialization span research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) activities, including development of new materials, reactors, and processes, and rigorous monitoring of a portfolio of demonstration projects. As a world leader in supporting science and engineering, the United States (US) can play an important role in reducing costs and clarifying the sustainable scale of CDR. To date, federal agencies have focused on voluntary or piecemeal CDR programs. Here, we present a synthesis of research and developement needs, relevant agency authority, barriers to coordination, and interventions to enhance RD&D across the federal government of the US. On the basis of agency authority and expertise, the Department of Energy, Department of Agriculture, Department of the Interior, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and National Science Foundation are most central to conducting research, funding projects, monitoring effects, and promulgating regulations. Key enablers for successful programs include embracing technological diversity and administrative efficiency, fostering agency buy-in, and achieving commercial deployment. Based on these criteria, the executive branch could effectively coordinate RD&D strategy through two complementary pathways: (1) renewing intra-agency commitment to CDR in five primary agencies, including both research and demonstration, and (2) coordinating research prioritization and outcomes across agencies, led by the Office of Science and Technology Policy and loosely based on the National Nanotechnology Initiative. Both pathways can be stimulated by executive order or Congressional mandate. Executive branch implementation can begin at any time; future Farm and Energy Bills provide legislative vehicles for enhancing programs. Â© 2018 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - A frequency control strategy for offshore wind power based on electrochemical energy storage
AB  - Offshore wind power has the advantages of abundant resources, high cleanliness and ease of consumption, and its role in building a new power system is becoming more prominent, driven by the goal of carbon compliance and carbon neutrality. The AC convergence of offshore wind power is still the main convergence method, and rapid fluctuations in wind speed and sudden increases in offshore load can cause rapid fluctuations in the frequency of the convergence bus, reducing power quality. This paper summarises the offshore wind power offshore side structure and analyses the factors affecting the stability of the convergence bus. Subsequently wind turbine participation in frequency regulation is compared and an offshore wind power frequency regulation strategy based on electrochemical energy storage is proposed. Finally, the configuration principle of energy storage participation in frequency regulation is studied so that electrochemical energy storage can participate in frequency stabilisation under droop control and virtual inertia control. Simulation results show that the strategy proposed in this paper provides better frequency characteristics and better power quality for offshore wind power generation. Â© 2022 IEEE.

TI  - Impacts of light shading and nutrient enrichment geo-engineering approaches on the productivity of a stratified, oligotrophic ocean ecosystem
AB  - Geo-engineering proposals to mitigate global warming have focused either on methods of carbon dioxide removal, particularly nutrient fertilization of plant growth, or on cooling the Earth's surface by reducing incoming solar radiation (shading). Marine phytoplankton contribute half the Earth's biological carbon fixation and carbon export in the ocean is modulated by the actions of microbes and grazing communities in recycling nutrients. Both nutrients and light are essential for photosynthesis, so understanding the relative influence of both these geo-engineering approaches on ocean ecosystem production and processes is critical to the evaluation of their effectiveness. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between light and nutrient availability on productivity in a stratified, oligotrophic subtropical ocean ecosystem using a one-dimensional water column model coupled to a multi-plankton ecosystem model, with the goal of elucidating potential impacts of these geo-engineering approaches on ecosystem production. We find that solar shading approaches can redistribute productivity in the water column but do not change total production. Macronutrient enrichment is able to enhance the export of carbon, although heterotrophic recycling reduces the efficiency of carbon export substantially over time. Our results highlight the requirement for a fuller consideration of marine ecosystem interactions and feedbacks, beyond simply the stimulation of surface blooms, in the evaluation of putative geo-engineering approaches.

TI  - Redox chemistry of advanced functional material for low-cost and environment-friendly seawater energy storage
AB  - Although rechargeable seawater batteries are promising energy storage systems, their electrochemical performance is inferior to that of lithium batteries; moreover, opportunities for improving their performance are restricted by the limited range of available anode materials to complement seawater cathodes. Organic redox materials can help overcome the drawbacks associated with seawater batteries because of their inherent fast charge transfer capability. Therefore, in this study, we design a unique hybrid seawater battery in which poly (4-styrenesulfonate) as a sodium-ion storage polymer is functionalized with hard carbon (HC) to form a functional anode with high capacity by in situ polymerization. Sodium-ion storage mechanisms of the poly (4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) and HC-PSS functional material are investigated through electron spin resonance, solid nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and molecular orbital studies. Each HC and PSS in the HC-PSS electrode clearly contribute to reversible electrochemical reactions. This polymer is observed to prevent the growth of a solid electrolyte interface on the surface of the functionalized HC-PSS anode, and the seawater battery exhibits excellent electrochemical properties, making it suitable for high-performance eco-friendly energy storage systems.

TI  - Strong time dependence of ocean acidification mitigation by atmospheric carbon dioxide removal
AB  - In Paris in 2015, the global community agreed to limit global warming to well below 2 âˆ˜C, aiming at even 1.5 âˆ˜C. It is still uncertain whether these targets are sufficient to preserve marine ecosystems and prevent a severe alteration of marine biogeochemical cycles. Here, we show that stringent mitigation strategies consistent with the 1.5 âˆ˜C scenario could, indeed, provoke a critical difference for the oceanâ€™s carbon cycle and calcium carbonate saturation states. Favorable conditions for calcifying organisms like tropical corals and polar pteropods, both of major importance for large ecosystems, can only be maintained if CO2 emissions fall rapidly between 2025 and 2050, potentially requiring an early deployment of CO2 removal techniques in addition to drastic emissions reduction. Furthermore, this outcome can only be achieved if the terrestrial biosphere remains a carbon sink during the entire 21st century. Â© 2019, The Author(s).

TI  - Performances of novel technologies for the exploitation of CO2-rich natural gas reserves
AB  - Natural gas is the fastest growing fossil fuel in future global energy scenarios. The consequent increase in the global demand for it has led to the need for the exploitation of those reserves that were left undeveloped in the past because of the high CO2 content. The selection of the best CO2 removal process is nowadays a critical concern, since each one has its own advantages and disadvantages when compared to the others. In particular, it is widely acknowledged that, for application to gas reserves characterized by a high CO2 content, conventional technologies based on chemical absorption are too energy-intensive because of the high energy required for solvent regeneration. Thus, new technologies have been recently proposed to treat the raw natural gas extracted from these reserves in a less energy-intensive and cost-effective way. Among these new technologies, low-temperature separation methods and hybrid technologies can be mentioned. The aim of this work is to compare the performances of a novel technology based on low-temperature distillation with those of a hybrid technology that combines a low-temperature distillation process aimed at performing a bulk CO2 removal with conventional chemical absorption into aqueous alkanolamines solutions as a finishing treatment. Simulations have been performed with Aspen HysysÂ® and Aspen PlusÂ® and the comparison has been carried out by means of an energy analysis based on the â€œnet equivalent methaneâ€ method. Different CO2 contents in the raw natural gas feed stream have been considered in order to establish the breakeven point between the two technologies in terms of CO2 inlet concentration that makes one process less energy-demanding than the other one.

TI  - The effectiveness of net negative carbon dioxide emissions in reversing anthropogenic climate change
AB  - Artificial removal of CO2 from the atmosphere (also referred to as negative emissions) has been proposed as a means to restore the climate system to a desirable state, should the impacts of climate change become 'dangerous'. Here we explore whether negative emissions are indeed effective in reversing climate change on human timescales, given the potentially counteracting effect of natural carbon sinks and the inertia of the climate system. We designed a range of CO2 emission scenarios, which follow a gradual transition to a zero-carbon energy system and entail implementation of various amounts of net-negative emissions at technologically plausible rates. These scenarios are used to force an Earth System Model of intermediate complexity. Results suggest that while it is possible to revert to a desired level of warming (e.g. 2 Â°C above pre-industrial) after different levels of overshoot, thermosteric sea level rise is not reversible for at least several centuries, even under assumption of large amounts of negative CO2 emissions. During the net-negative emission phase, artificial CO2 removal is opposed by CO2 outgassing from natural carbon sinks, with the efficiency of CO2 removal - here defined as the drop in atmospheric CO2 per unit negative emission - decreasing with the total amount of negative emissions.

TI  - NEW CONCEPTS FOR NATURAL-GAS FIRED POWER-PLANTS WHICH SIMPLIFY THE RECOVERY OF CARBON-DIOXIDE
AB  - This paper presents the results from an evaluation of the performance and cost of a natural gas fired sea water cooled combined cycle power plant (700 MW) with emissions control equipment (amine scrubbing) to achieve a 90\% reduction in atmospheric discharge of carbon dioxide (CO2). This reduction of the CO2 content in the flue gas is achieved by amine scrubbing (CO2 removal), removal of water from CO2 (drying), compression to pipeline pressure, and transport from the Norwegian coastal line to a North Sea oil/gas field (250 km) where it is disposed. The paper also presents an evaluation of the design of two power plants concepts with feed of oxygen from an air separation plant, and thereby avoiding the need for downstream removal of CO2 from the flue gas before compression, drying and pipeline transport.

TI  - ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF ENERGY CARRIERS FROM OCEAN THERMAL ENERGY PLANTS.
AB  - Ocean thermal energy could become a valuable source of a supplementary energy supply. Because many of the most favorable plant sites are located many miles offshore, an important part of this overall energy system would be the link between the OTEC plant and the energy markets it serves. The overall credibility of the OTEC concept could be largely dependent upon the availability and economics of the transmission system. IGT has examined the technoeconomic characteristics of three hitherto unexamined concepts for converting OTEC energy to a storable transportable form and shipping it to a shore terminal. These systems were compared with hydrogen and ammonia transmission. One concept deals with an OTEC electrical system which is used to produce high-temperature heat and shipping this thermal energy to shore in some form of thermal energy system such as a molten salt. The high-temperature heat would be used for either electricity generation or process applications. The second concept is to use OTEC energy to produce chemical or hydrocarbon-type fuels using electrolytic hydrogen produced onboard and carbon dioxide extracted from seawater or delivered by some form of back-haul from a shore station. Two types of chemical fuels were considered: methane, methanol, and conventional light fuels of the gasoline family, and also high energy chemical fuels such as hydrazine. The third concept is an electrochemical bridge concept that assesses a redox-type and an advanced lithium/lithium hydroxide type battery.

TI  - Climate Engineering: Economic Considerations and Research Challenges
AB  - Climate engineering measures are designed to either reduce atmospheric carbon concentration (by growing trees or spreading iron in the ocean, for example) or directly influence the radiation reaching or leaving the earth (by injecting sulfur into the stratosphere or modifying cloud formations, for example) to compensate for greenhouse gas-induced warming. The former measures are termed carbon dioxide removal (CDR), which we characterize as a low-leverage causative approach, and the latter are termed radiation management (RM), which we characterize as a high-leverage symptomatic approach. There are similarities between CDR and emission control. Accordingly, benefit-cost analysis can be used to assess certain CDR measures. By contrast, high-leverage RM represents a genuinely new option in the climate change response portfolio, at first glance promising insurance against fat-tail climate change risks. However, the persistent intrinsic uncertainties of RM suggest that any cautious climate risk management approach should consider RM as a complement to (rather than a substitute for) emission control at best. Moreover, the complexity of the earth system imposes major limitations on the ability of research to reduce these uncertainties. Thus we argue that a research strategy is needed that focuses on increasing our basic understanding of the earth system and conducting comprehensive assessments of the risk(s) associated with both climate change and the deployment of climate engineering.

TI  - Asymmetries in tropical rainfall and circulation patterns in idealised CO2 removal experiments
AB  - Atmospheric CO2 removal is currently receiving serious consideration as a supplement or even alternative to emissions reduction. However the possible consequences of such a strategy for the climate system, and particularly for regional changes to the hydrological cycle, are not well understood. Two idealised general circulation model experiments are described, where CO2 concentrations are steadily increased, then decreased along the same path. Global mean precipitation continues to increase for several decades after CO2 begins to decrease. The mean tropical circulation shows associated changes due to the constraint on the global circulation imposed by precipitation and water vapour. The patterns of precipitation and circulation change also exhibit asymmetries with regard to changes in both CO2 and global mean temperature, but while the lag in global precipitation can be ascribed to different levels of CO2 at the same temperature state, the regional changes cannot. Instead, ocean memory and heat transfer are important here. In particular the equatorial East Pacific continues to warm relative to the West Pacific during CO2 ramp-down, producing an anomalously large equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature gradient and associated rainfall anomalies. The mechanism is likely to be a lag in response to atmospheric forcing between mixed-layer water in the east Pacific and the sub-thermocline water below, due to transport through the ocean circulation. The implication of this study is that a CO2 pathway of increasing then decreasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations may lead us to climate states during CO2 decrease that have not been experienced during the increase.

TI  - Electrochemical limestone synthesis in seawater binds metal grids and sediments for coastal protection
AB  - Coastal erosion is accelerating due to global warming, thus weakening infrastructures and threatening the population. Actual remediation techniques are costly, resource-consuming and vulnerable. Here, we designed the synthesis of a carbonate rock by seawater electrolysis to reinforce engineering infrastructures. Inspired by electrochemical cathodic protection, the new technique involves the application of a low current in a buried metal grid to precipitate aragonite (CaCO3) and brucite (Mg(OH)(2)), which agglomerate the metal grid with the sediment. We tested the effects of power surface densities, 3 and 5 W/m(2), on agglomerate properties during more than 2 years in natural conditions. We measured agglomerate thickness, accessible water porosity and axial compressive strength. The results show growth rates of 2.5 mm/month at 3 W/m(2) and 4.1 mm/month at 5 W/m(2) during the first 32 months. Data on material properties do not show a significant effect of power surface density. Maximum porosity of 16\% is reached after 12 months, and maximum compressive strength of 10 MPa is obtained after 18 months. Overall, our findings confirm under outdoor conditions the practical application of electrochemical limestone synthesis for reinforcement of the coastal infrastructures.

TI  - Simulation of an Offshore Natural Gas Purification Process for CO2 Removal with Gas-Liquid Contactors Employing Aqueous Solutions of Ethanolamines
AB  - In the scenario of offshore rigs angular indifference, modularity, and compactness strongly influence selection of technology for natural gas purfication. Gas-liquid contactors have such attributes and perform gas absorption without the concerns of packing columns like weight, flooding, gravitational alignment, and water saturation. This paper proposes a model for gas-liquid hollow fiber contactors using aqueous akanolamines for CO2 removal from high pressure natural gas. The model assumes high-pressure compressible flows of both permeate and retentate with full thermodynamics via equations of state. Permeate is approached as a reactive vapor-liquid equilibrium flow of solvent with CO2/CH4 from membrane fluxes. Phase change and reactive heat effects are modeled via mass, energy, and mementum balances written fro permeate/retentate as a differential-algebraic system for dependent variables temperature, pressure and component flows. Profiles are obtained via numerical spatial integration with algebraic resolution imbedded, accounting for permeate reactive vapor-liquid equilibrium with only the molecular species incorporated into a Chemical Theory framework.

TI  - Carbon Dioxide Neutralization across the Global Supply Chain
AB  - The increased impacts of climatic changes and global warming has led many organizations to adopt green initiatives in several areas of their business processes. Many multinational companies are moving towards reduction of carbon emission across its various operations. Carbon neutrality is the process where steps are taken to achieve net zero carbon dioxide emissions. This article proposes measures to achieve carbon neutrality across the supply chain globally. As part of its sustainability initiative, organizations have decided to reduce carbon consumption across their plants. This calls for estimation of carbon dioxide emissions and reducing the carbon footprint in the entire supply chain process. It also involves gauging Green House CO2 emissions during the transportation process for all TMC regions and Transportation models used by various companies. The main calculations include total CO2 emissions, CO2 Emissions per Ton. Of Goods Transported, CO2 Emissions per Transport Km. These calculations are done based on factors such as Full Truck Load, Less Truck Load, Sea mode of transportation and Air mode of transportation. An analysis is performed on the resulting calculation figures for different modes of transportation such as road, air and sea. The analysis shows that there is an increase in overall CO2e for Air mode of transportation. The least increase in overall Co2 is Sea mode of transportation. Through this analysis, it helps the company to take better decisions regarding the mode of transportation that they need to adopt to achieve carbon neutrality. Â© The Electrochemical Society

TI  - Development of an Electrochemical Acidification Cell for the Recovery of CO2 and H-2 from Seawater II. Evaluation of the Cell by Natural Seawater
AB  - A novel electrochemical acidification process has been developed in a successful feasibility attempt to extract large quantities of CO2 in the form of bicarbonate and carbonate from seawater for potential use as a source of carbon for hydrocarbon production at sea. This indirect approach acidifies seawater by the electrolytic production of acid. Lowering seawater pH was found to be proportional to the applied current to the cell. Spontaneous degassing and recovery of CO2 below pH 4.5 was reduced from 92\% in synthetic seawater to 30\% in natural seawater. The effects of increased operational time, flow rate, current, and natural seawater's complex equilibrium buffer on process performance and CO2 recovery have been shown to be essential for further improvements in future cell design, efficiency, and scale-up.

TI  - Hugging the Shore: Tackling Marine Carbon Dioxide Removal as a Local Governance Problem
AB  - This Perspective explores the local governance of ocean-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Proposals to enhance the ability of oceans and marine ecosystems to absorb atmospheric CO2 are often discussed as examples of â€œgeoengineering,â€ but this framing obscures the site-specific nature of most of the suggested interventions. The Perspective outlines some of the key local dimensions of marine CDR as currently imagined, and suggests a framework for increasing local participation in its assessment. Robust processes of local participation are essential to address the place-based conflicts that are bound to emerge if any of the proposed methods of CO2 removal is ever deployed at scale.

TI  - Green algae as a sustainable source for energy generation and storage technologies
AB  - In light of the environmental and human health threats posed by electronic waste, taking advantage of the properties and compounds of green algae presents timely and sustainable energetic alternatives. This review is focused on the technologies developed to use green micro- and macro-algae for energy storage and generation. The main applications of these algae-based technologies include the extraction of bio-fuels and the fabrication of energy storage and energy conversion devices. Bio-oil, H-2-rich syngas, and H-2 are among the essential bio-fuels produced from green algae feedstock. The hydrogen production of these green algae-derived bio-fuels ranges from 16.8 to 84.1 \%. Cellulose, activated carbon, among other materials and compounds extracted from green algae have been used to fabricate electrodes and separation membranes which are part of batteries and supercapacitors, two of the most crucial energy storage devices available for electronic systems. The specific capacitance and current density of these devices have reached 1617 F/g and 31 A/g, respectively. Natural dyes extracted from green algae have been proved to be suitable for the development of novel dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC), with an open circuit voltage in the range of 0.62 V - 0.75 V. In addition, microbial fuel cells have been tailored to use the oxygen released by the photosynthetic reactions of algae growth as an oxygen source for the cathodic reactions that convert H-2 into electricity. Although a wide range of energy applications of green algae are presented, there are still many challenges to overcome before obtaining commercially viable and scalable technologies. Further research needs are discussed.

TI  - Long-term response of oceans to CO2 removal from the atmosphere
AB  - Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere has been proposed as a measure for mitigating global warming and ocean acidification. To assess the extent to which CDR might eliminate the long-term consequences of anthropogenic CO2 emissions in the marine environment, we simulate the effect of two massive CDR interventions with CO2 extraction rates of 5 GtC yr(-1) and 25 GtC yr(-1), respectively, while CO2 emissions follow the extended RCP8.5 pathway. We falsify two hypotheses: the first being that CDR can restore pre-industrial conditions in the ocean by reducing the atmospheric CO2 concentration back to its pre-industrial level, and the second being that high CO2 emissions rates (RCP8.5) followed by CDR have long-term oceanic consequences that are similar to those of low emissions rates (RCP2.6). Focusing on pH, temperature and dissolved oxygen, we find that even after several centuries of CDR deployment, past CO2 emissions would leave a substantial legacy in the marine environment.

TI  - OVERVIEW OF CARBON-DIOXIDE REMOVAL AND DISPOSAL IN CANADA
AB  - Canada's present position is to stabilize emissions of greenhouse gases, including CO2, at the 1990 levels by the year 2000. While the major element to achieve this is efficiency, future options must be kept open. One of the technical options is CO2 removal and disposal. Several technical studies are underway, notably a pilot project for CO2 removal from a coal-fired electric generating station for use in enhanced oil recovery (in Saskatchewan) and a large, Alberta-led feasibility study on removal and use in enhanced oil recovery. Potential sinks include exhausted natural gas reservoirs in Canada's western sedimentary basin. Precipitating out salts may be possible by combining CO2 with the huge subsurface brine (evaporites) occurrences in the Western Sedimentary Basin and elsewhere. Deep ocean disposal is a distant possibility. Technical investigations into removal and disposal should continue.

TI  - Barrier behavior evaluation of polyamide 12 nanoclay composite to offshore application by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
AB  - Commercially, polyamide 12 (PA12) is one of the polymers applied as an internal insulation layer in offshore exploitation. The present study aims to produce a hybrid system based on PA12 with 5 wt\% of a nanoclay grade (montmorillonite - MMT) and evaluate its effect on the barrier behavior of the PA12 matrix, the exact grade used in the pressure layer of flexible pipe, over carbon steel AISI 1020, metallic alloy responsible for providing the mechanical properties to flexible pipes. The barrier behavior, related to ion and molecule diffusion in synthetic production water, was assessed by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) analysis, which allow for interpreting the carbon steel corrosion mechanisms. One also carried out Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, and Scanning electron microscopy analyzes. The data showed that the MMT lamellae are well-dispersed in the PA12 matrix. EIS and LSV analysis results showed higher corrosion protection efficiency by the system composed of PA12/MMT once compared to the system without adding the load.

TI  - Irreversible ocean thermal expansion under carbon dioxide removal
AB  - In the Paris Agreement in 2015 countries agreed on holding global mean surface air warming to well below 2-Â°C above pre-industrial levels, but the emission reduction pledges under that agreement are not ambitious enough to meet this target. Therefore, the question arises of whether restoring global warming to this target after exceeding it by artificially removing CO2 from the atmosphere is possible. One important aspect is the reversibility of ocean heat uptake and associated sea level rise, which have very long (centennial to millennial) response timescales. In this study the response of sea level rise due to thermal expansion to a 1-% yearly increase of atmospheric CO2 up to a quadrupling of the pre-industrial concentration followed by a 1-% yearly decline back to the pre-industrial CO2 concentration is examined using the University of Victoria Earth System Climate Model (UVic ESCM). We find that global mean thermosteric sea level (GMTSL) continues to rise for several decades after atmospheric CO2 starts to decline and does not return to pre-industrial levels for over 1000 years after atmospheric CO2 is restored to the pre-industrial concentration. This finding is independent of the strength of vertical sub-grid-scale ocean mixing implemented in the model. Furthermore, GMTSL rises faster than it declines in response to a symmetric rise and decline in atmospheric CO2 concentration partly because the deep ocean continues to warm for centuries after atmospheric CO2 returns to the pre-industrial concentration. Both GMTSL rise and decline rates increase with increasing vertical ocean mixing. Exceptions from this behaviour arise if the overturning circulations in the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean intensify beyond pre-industrial levels in model versions with lower vertical mixing, which leads to rapid cooling of the deep ocean.

TI  - Irreversibility of Marine Climate Change Impacts Under Carbon Dioxide Removal
AB  - Artificial carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere has been proposed as a measure for mitigating climate change and restoring the climate system to a target state after exceedance (â€œovershootâ€). This research investigates to what extent overshoot and subsequent recovery of a given cumulative CO2 emissions level by CDR leaves a legacy in the marine environment using an Earth system model. We use RCP2.6 and its extension to year 2300 as the reference scenario and design a set of cumulative emissions and temperature overshoot scenarios based on other RCPs. Our results suggest that the overshoot and subsequent return to a reference cumulative emissions level would leave substantial impacts on the marine environment. Although the changes in sea surface temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen are largely reversible, global mean values and spatial patterns of these variables differ significantly from those in the reference scenario when the reference cumulative emissions are attained.

TI  - Upgrading of natural gas ultra-rich in carbon dioxide: Optimal arrangement of membrane skids and polishing with chemical absorption
AB  - Water depths in oil and gas offshore production are moving from shallow to deep and ultra-deepwaters. Floating Production Storage and Offloading platforms are preferred in such frontier offshore enterprises. However, ultra-deepwaters natural gas processing imposes challenges in the design of floating units, limited in area and weight of processing equipment. Oil reserves with high gas/oil ratio (&gt;250 sm3/m3) and high carbon dioxide content create additional challenges due to the impacts in the deck area of the gas plant. Among other natural gas processing operations, removal of carbon dioxide is required to meet sales gas specification, being skid-mounted membrane modules well suited for this purpose. To avoid emissions and to increase oil production, the separated acid gas is injected for enhanced oil recovery, creating a changing scenario due to increasing carbon dioxide content in the reservoir along production lifetime. In this context, this work optimizes arrangements of membranes modules and operational conditions via nonlinear programming formulations to optimize total membrane area for minimum footprint of membrane skids, with either carbon dioxide content in the treated natural gas less than 3%mol (Type 1 Constraint) or methane losses in the injection gas limited by imposing carbon dioxide content in the injection gas greater than 75%mol (Type 2 Constraint). To reduce computational effort, surface response models are employed, regressed from data simulated with a rigorous phenomenological model of spiral-wound membrane modules. Optimization results â€“ total and stage area, carbon dioxide contents in retentates and permeates and natural gas production â€“ are obtained for three feed scenarios: 10%mol, 30%mol and 50%mol carbon dioxide in raw natural gas. Type 1 Constraint leads to higher methane losses while Type 2 Constraint demands a polishing Chemical Absorption to comply with carbon dioxide specification of sales gas, configuring a hybrid process. Life cycle costs and total footprint area point to superiority of carbon dioxide separation design resulting from Type 2 Constraint, with optimal service distribution between bulk removal in Membrane Permeation and polishing operation in Chemical Absorption, considering time-varying composition of the raw natural gas.

TI  - Alternative cost-effective electrodes for hydrogen production in saline water condition
AB  - For the sustainable clean and green energy, hydrogen is considered as one of the prominent renewable energy source which attracted increasing interests in recent years. To produce this, one of the cheapest method is water electrolysis. But several challenges in water electrolysis are, to reduce the maintenance cost, energy consumption and high cost of platinum electrode material. So, in search of an alternative low cost and efficient electrode material, researchers are modifying various metals electrodes to replace the noble metal electrodes. Stainless steel (SS 304) is one of the types of carbon steel material commonly used for various applications. The aim of the work is to explore the stainless steel (SS 304), annealed at high temperature, with and without ``hydrogen and argon{''} environment and tested the samples for hydrogen production in sea water condition (3.5\% NaCl). Cr2O3 and MnCr2O4 spinel oxide formation was observed over the surface of the electrodes after annealing process. From Raman, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical measurements it was observed that, the sample prepared under hydrogen and argon environment is stable when compared with the rest of the samples. Decrease in relative amount of chromium oxide was observed for the sample annealed in air environment. The rate of production of hydrogen prepared under ``hydrogen and argon{'' environment is higher and the results are discussed. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Navigating Potential Hype and Opportunity in Governing Marine Carbon Removal
AB  - As the technical and political challenges of land-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR) approaches become more apparent, the oceans may be the new â€œblueâ€ frontier for carbon drawdown strategies in climate governance. Drawing on lessons learnt from the way terrestrial carbon dioxide removal emerged, we explore increasing overall attention to marine environments and mCDR projects, and how this could manifest in four entwined knowledge systems and governance sectors. We consider how developments within and between these â€œfrontiersâ€ could result in different futuresâ€”where hype and over-promising around marine carbon drawdown could enable continued time-buying for the carbon economy without providing significant removals, or where reforms to modeling practices, policy development, innovation funding, and legal governance could seek co-benefits between ocean protection, economy, and climate.

TI  - Metal-Free Carbon Materials for CO2 Electrochemical Reduction
AB  - The rapid increase of the CO2 concentration in the Earth's atmosphere has resulted in numerous environmental issues, such as global warming, ocean acidification, melting of the polar ice, rising sea level, and extinction of species. To search for suitable and capable catalytic systems for CO2 conversion, electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) holds great promise. Emerging heterogeneous carbon materials have been considered as promising metal-free electrocatalysts for the CO2RR, owing to their abundant natural resources, tailorable porous structures, resistance to acids and bases, high-temperature stability, and environmental friendliness. They exhibit remarkable CO2RR properties, including catalytic activity, long durability, and high selectivity. Here, various carbon materials (e.g., carbon fibers, carbon nanotubes, graphene, diamond, nanoporous carbon, and graphene dots) with heteroatom doping (e.g., N, S, and B) that can be used as metal-free catalysts for the CO2RR are highlighted. Recent advances regarding the identification of active sites for the CO2RR and the pathway of reduction of CO2 to the final product are comprehensively reviewed. Additionally, the emerging challenges and some perspectives on the development of heteroatom-doped carbon materials as metal-free electrocatalysts for the CO2RR are included.

TI  - Rates of carbon remineralization in coastal wetland sediments under sulfate reducing and methanogenic conditions: Implications for sea level rise and global warming
AB  - The prospect of global warming caused by increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations has generated extensive research into the sources and removal mechanisms (sinks) for this greenhouse gas. Photosynthesis or the conversion of atmospheric CO2 into plant biomass represents the largest biological removal mechanism for atmospheric CO2 each year. During a sea level rise, methanogenic freshwater wetland sediments would be converted to sulfate reducing conditions possibly decreasing the rate at which carbon is stored in these systems thereby reducing the ability of these wetland systems to store atmospheric CO2 removed via photosynthesis. This phenomenon including the measurements of respiration rates of freshwater sediments with and without the addition of seawater was presented. The rates of remineralization of organic matter contained in these wetland sediments under sulfate reducing and methanogenic conditions were compared. Carbon remineralization rates were significantly greater at all freshwater wetland sites under sulfate reducing conditions compared to freshwater methanogenic conditions. This is an abstract of a paper originally presented at the 225th ACS National Meeting (New Orleans, LA 3/23-27/2003).

TI  - Emission reduction in shipping using hydrogen and fuel cells
AB  - Despite various technical and operational improvements, shipping remains a contributor to global emissions of greenhouse gases, nitrogen oxides, and sulphur oxides, among others. As a part of its efforts to limit adverse health and environmental impacts of shipping, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has enforced regulations to control these emissions. In addition, some countries, such as Norway have imposed additional regulations to control emissions further. Environmental regulations and concerns call for an improved environmental profile within shipping, which motivates this study. Alternative fuels and power systems are required for a substantial reduction in emissions from shipping. Hydrogen and fuel cells are among the most promising solutions from an environmental perspective. A fuel cell is an electrochemical conversion device, which produces electricity through the reaction of an oxidant with hydrogen or another hydrogen-rich fuel, such as a hydrocarbon fuel. Since the electricity production does not entail fuel combustion, emissions are reduced substantially. When hydrogen gas is used as the fuel, only water is formed as the byproduct. In addition to emitting ultralow or zero emissions, fuel cells offer high energy conversion efficiency, low noise level, and low vibration. The Norwegian energy system is based on electricity from renewable energy sources and mainly hydropower. Renewable energy output is strongly affected by the weather conditions, among other factors, and the supplies fluctuate accordingly. There is a need for a means to store and use the renewable energy surplus. In addition, from a technical point of view Norway still has potential to further develop hydro and wind power. Excess power can be used for production of hydrogen through water electrolysis, which in turn can fuel different means of transportation, such as shipping. This paper aims at contributing to the research body on the use of hydrogen and fuel cells in shipping. First, a short introduction to hydrogen fuel and fuel cells is given. Then, an elaboration on pros and cons of powering vessels with fuel cells is presented. After providing an overview of current marine applications of fuel cells, the paper discusses potential vessels, which can benefit from this technology. Finally, the environmental benefits of using fuel cells are shown through a preliminary case study. Data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) in the Norwegian waters is used for estimating operational profile of a vessel, its current emissions, and potential emission reduction by using hydrogen and fuel cells. The results of this study show the potential of hydrogen and fuel cells in reducing emissions of shipping and set forth the research gaps. Â© 2017 ASME.

TI  - Effects of vibrations in marine environments on performance of molten-carbonate fuel cells
AB  - Owing to the strengthening of environmental regulations, highly efficient and environmentally sustainable power supply systems have attracted significant attention as auxiliary power units (APUs) for marine applications. Among several candidates, molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs) is of particularly interest because it provides high efficiency with essentially no greenhouse gas emissions of NOx and SOx. In this study, the effects of vibrations caused by sea-waves and swells on the operation of MCFCs on marine ships are investigated. An MCFC single cell with a unit area of 100 cm(2) was tested in a vibration environment at an operating temperature of 620 degrees C. At a low sealing pressure (0.1 MPa), the performance of the cell decreased owing to increased mass-transfer resistance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that using oxygen and CO2 as the cathode reactants mitigates the degradation by the vibration induced mass-transfer resistance. In addition, the MCFC single cell is operated under various vibration conditions, including the resonance frequency (13 and 29 Hz). It was found that the vibration environment does not affect the performance of MCFCs under normal operating conditions. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Assessment of the exergy performance of a floating, production, storage and offloading (FPSO) unit: Influence of three operational modes
AB  - Oil and gas industries are developing energy efficiency programs in order to enhance the performance of their production activities, including the floating, production, storage and offloading (FPSO) operations. FPSOs are floating vessels designed for hydrocarbons processing and include other functions such as: oil treatment and storage, gas treatment and compression for export, lift, and injection, and seawater treatment and injection. The exergy method is useful to identify potential energy savings for the improvement of the FPSO processes. In this study, an evaluation of the exergy performance of the FPSO is carried out and the main goal is to investigate the influence of three operating modes on the following criteria: Exergy efficiency, specific exergy consumption, renewability exergy index, CO2 emissions and CO2 emissions normalized to exergy of the product streams of the plant. The FPSO performance assessment described in this paper takes into account three operational modes depending on the CO2 content in the well stream. Additionally, the FPSO utilizes membrane technology for CO2 removal from the separated gas. In the operational mode 1, all gas is sent through the bypass of the CO2 removal system and it is injected into the production wells; in the mode 2, part of the gas is treated in the CO2 removal system to be exported, and the other part is injected in the production wells; and in the mode 3, all gas is exported and the removed CO2 is injected in the well. Simulations of the processing and utilities plants in the FPSO were carried out using software Aspen HYSYSÂ®. Results show that the observed variations in exergy efficiency of the three operational modes could be, mainly, attributed to the increase of oil and gas fractions in the well stream.

TI  - Green and sustainable molten salt electrochemistry for the conversion of secondary carbon pollutants to advanced carbon materials
AB  - Carbon emissions have caused serious climate changes such as global warming, glacier melting, and sea level rise. Carbon neutrality has become a global target and the sustainable disposal of carbon pollutants, such as CO2 and low value-added solid carbon wastes, is crucial to solve the climate problem. Expectedly, carbon pollutants are also considered as abundant secondary carbon resources for high value-added utilization. In the past decade, a green and sustainable molten salt electrochemical method has been innovatively developed to directly convert carbon pollutants to advanced graphitized carbon materials. It provides a promising and economic route for the value-added utilization of carbon pollutants to promote the impressive target of carbon neutrality. The electro-conversion mechanisms of CO2 and solid carbon resources to high value-added graphitized carbon materials are deeply discussed. The demands and the development status of inert anodes for molten salt electrochemistry are summarized. The micro-structure adjustment of carbon materials from CO2 is reviewed and the dependence of the graphitization degree is analyzed in detail. A preliminary application evaluation of CO2 electro-conversion in molten salt is carried out. The molten salt electrochemical graphitization conversion of low value-added solid carbon resources is summarized. Furthermore, the promising applications of carbon nanomaterials from carbon pollutants for batteries, supercapacitors, and catalysts are highlighted.

TI  - Customizing membrane system solutions for gas separation applications
AB  - Using semi-permeable membrane systems for gas separation, especially CO2 removal from hydrocarbon gas streams, is definitely state of the art technology. The process is environmentally attractive and offers capital cost advantages, as well as operational advantages. The technology is commercially proven and advantageous in a multitude of applications - most notably in offshore environments where space and weight savings are primary drivers, and in applications where bulk CO2 recovery is necessary. A discussion on design considerations for a successful CO2 removal process using membranes covers the membranes that are currently commercially available for CO2 separation, e.g., cellulose acetate, polyimide, and silicone rubber; system design, which involves project specifications, inlet operating conditions, site requirements, scope of supply, warranty, safety and operability issues, as well as environmental issues; design optimization; and project execution.

TI  - Extracorporeal CO2 removal
AB  - The extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) concept, used as an integrated tool with conventional ventilation, plays a role in adjusting respiratory acidosis consequent to tidal volume (Vt) reduction in a protective ventilation setting. This concept arises from the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) experience. Kolobow and Gattinoni were the first to introduce extracorporeal support, with the intent to separate carbon dioxide removal from oxygen uptake; they hypothesized that to allow the lung to 'rest' oxygenation via mechanical ventilation could be dissociated from decarboxylation via extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal. Carbon dioxide is removed by a pump-driven modified ECMO machine with veno-venous bypass, while oxygenation is accomplished by high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure, with a respiratory rate of 3-5 breaths/min. The focus was that, in case of acute respiratory failure, CO2 extraction facilitates a reduction in ventilatory support and oxygenation is maintained by simple diffusion across the patient's alveoli, called 'apneic oxygenation'. Concerns have been raised regarding the standard use of extracorporeal support because of the high incidence of serious complications: hemorrhage; hemolysis, and neurological impairments. Due to the negative results of a clinical trial, the extensive resources required and the high incidence of side effects, low frequency positive pressure ventilation ECCO2R was restricted to a 'rescue' therapy for the most severe case of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Technological improvement led to the implementation of two different CO 2 removal approaches: the iLA called 'pumpless arteriovenous ECMO' and the veno-venous ECCO2R. They enable consideration of extracorporeal support as something more than mere rescue therapy; both of them are indicated in more protective ventilation settings in case of severe ARDS, and as a support to the spontaneous breathing/lung function in bridge to lung transplant. The future development of more and more efficient devices capable of removing a substantial amount of carbon dioxide production (30-100%) with blood flows of 250-500 ml/min is foreseeable. Moreover, in the future ARDS management should include a minimally invasive ECCO2R circuit associated with noninvasive ventilation. This would embody the modern mechanical ventilation philosophy: avoid tracheal tubes; minimize sedation, and prevent ventilator-induced acute lung injury and nosocomial infections.

TI  - Thermoeconomic analysis of technical greenhouse warming mitigation
AB  - A model process is presented for carbon dioxide removal from the flue gases of hard coal fired power plants by refrigeration under pressure. Retention of 90% of the CO2 decreases overall plant efficiency from 38% to 26%. Deep sea deposition or decomposition of the CO2 in solar-thermal processes with solar hydrogen may complete the removal. CO2 emissions can also be curbed by reduced fossil fuel consumption at constant energy services. Heat cascading via heat exchangers, cogeneration and heat pumps are the appropriate conservation technologies. On the basis of given energy demand profiles and by means of vector optimization combined with the methods of Second Law Analysis we investigate the trade-offs between fossil fuel conservation, CO2 emissions and the total cost of the energy system. Without CO2 removal, the maximum saving potentials of primary energy in the industrial sector turn out to be about 25% in Germany, 30% in the U.S.A., and 45% in The Netherlands and Japan. Including CO2 removal techniques for power plants and cogeneration units in the energy-cost-CO2 optimization program, we find that in the combined German sectors of industry and households one may reduce overall emissions of CO2 by more than 70% and energy consumption by more than 20% at a total cost increase of 50-100%. Thus, continued use of fossil fuels and greenhouse warming mitigation seem to be possible, albeit at considerably enhanced cost. Â© 1992.

Maximum CO2 removal of 4.44 g/L/d was achieved using an initial cell concentration of 6.8 g/L. The biomass yield was 0.97 g/L for a 12-culture time. Continuous cultures, in which medium was filtered using a ceramic membrane module, showed enhanced growth, with a final cell concentration of 11.2 g/L. These results demonstrate the potential of LDOF photobioreactor units for CO2 removal and biomass production using marine cyanobacteria.

TI  - Graphene modified polyacrylonitrile fiber as high-performance cathode for marine sediment microbial fuel cells
AB  - The goal of this study is to make a high-performance cathode in a simple way, so that it can better serve marine sediment microbial fuel cells. We design a cathode by combining graphene with carbon fiber through a binder, and apply it for the first time to these cells, to improve the electrochemical performance of these cells while increasing the specific surface area of the cathode. This cathode shows excellent performance in a laboratory simulated marine environment. The specific surface area of graphene modified polyacrylonitrile fiber cathode reaches 41.13 m(2)/g, 1.5 times larger than that of the blank cathode (26.98 m(2)/g). Its capacitance and exchange current density are 6.1 times and 16.4 times higher than that of theblank cathode, respectively. The anti-polarization ability of the modified cathode was significantly improved, and the maximum power density of the cell equipped with the G/P cathode (2.12 kW/kg) is 6.24 times that of the blank (0.34 kW/kg). In terms of stability, it is quite resistant to prolonged seawater immersion or scouring. This excellent mechanical stability can extend the cells' life and reduce replacement costs.

TI  - THE FATE OF CO2 SEQUESTERED IN THE DEEP OCEAN
AB  - Based on published phase diagrams, laboratory and in situ observations we predict that liquid CO2 released from a diffuser below 500 m depth in the ocean will form solid hydrate particles of composition CO2.6H2O with bulk density 1.1 gcm-3. Being heavier than seawater the hydrate particles will sink to the ocean bottom. The sedimentation rate w depends on the particle diameter, drag coefficient, and the difference between particle and seawater bulk density. For particles in the size range 10(-5)-10(-3) m, w=5x10(-6)-0.02 ms-1. The dispersion of the particles on the ocean bottom also depends on the distance between the diffuser and the ocean bottom and the turbulent characteristics of the water column. For the above particle size range and a fall distance of 500 m, the median radius of the mound varies from 1 km for large particles to more than 500 km for small, slowly falling particles. For a 500 MW(el) coal fired power plant with a discharge rate of 170 kgs-1 of CO2, these parameters correspond to mass depositions of 4x10(-3)-1x10(3) kgm-2yr-1 at the plume centerline, or mound thicknesses that grow at rates of 4x10(-6)-1 myr-1. Hydrate particles may (1) interfere with the feeding habits of swimming creatures as they descend and (2) bury benthic organisms as they deposit to the ocean floor.

TI  - Simulating the Earth system response to negative emissions
AB  - Natural carbon sinks currently absorb approximately half of the anthropogenic CO2 emitted by fossil fuel burning, cement production and land-use change. However, this airborne fraction may change in the future depending on the emissions scenario. An important issue in developing carbon budgets to achieve climate stabilisation targets is the behaviour of natural carbon sinks, particularly under low emissions mitigation scenarios as required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. A key requirement for low carbon pathways is to quantify the effectiveness of negative emissions technologies which will be strongly affected by carbon cycle feedbacks. Here we find that Earth system models suggest significant weakening, even potential reversal, of the ocean and land sinks under future low emission scenarios. For the RCP2.6 concentration pathway, models project land and ocean sinks to weaken to 0.8 Â±0.9 and 1.1 Â±0.3 GtC yr-1 respectively for the second half of the 21st century and to -0.4 Â±0.4 and 0.1 Â±0.2 GtC yr-1 respectively for the second half of the 23rd century. Weakening of natural carbon sinks will hinder the effectiveness of negative emissions technologies and therefore increase their required deployment to achieve a given climate stabilisation target. We introduce a new metric, the perturbation airborne fraction, to measure and assess the effectiveness of negative emissions. Â© 2016 Crown copyright and IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Blue Energy for Green Hydrogen Fuel: A Self-Powered Electrochemical Conversion System Driven by Triboelectric Nanogenerators
AB  - Utilizing hydrogen energy produced by water electrolysis is conducive to carbon neutrality from a technological point of view. However, this perspective is restrained by the high electricity cost in commercial development. Powering electrochemical reactions by renewable electricity converted from distributed mechanical energy can lead to commercial electric energy saving and cost reduction. In this work, a self-powered electrochemical system (SPECS) is proposed for the conversion from blue energy of ocean waves to green energy via hydrogen fuel. This system consists of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) devices and an electrolyzer, where the TENG devices serve as ocean wave energy harvesters for electricity generation, while the seawater-containing electrolyzer is employed for hydrogen generation. After power management on the output of the TENGs and electrochemical reaction optimization, the system can generate hydrogen at a rate of 814.8 mu L m(-2) d(-1) and a Faraday efficiency of 69.1\% under ideal operation conditions, demonstrating the practical potential of the constructed system toward carbon neutralization.

TI  - Sustainable energy from deep ocean cold seeps
AB  - Two designs of benthic microbial fuel cell (BMFC) were deployed at cold seeps in Monterey Canyon, CA, unattended for between 68 and 162 days. One design had a cylindrical solid graphite anode buried vertically in sediment, and the other had a carbon fiber brush anode semi-enclosed in a chamber above the sediment-water interface. Each chamber included two check valves to allow fluid flow from the sediment into the chamber. On average, power outputs were 0.2 mW (32 mW m-2 normalized to cross sectional area) from the solid anode BMFC and from 11 to 56 mW (27-140 mW m-2) during three deployments of the chambered design. The range in power produced with the chambered BMFC was due to different valve styles, which appear to have permitted different rates of chemical seepage from the sediments into the anode chamber. Valves with the lowest breaking pressure led to the highest power production and presumably the highest inputs of electron donors. The increase in power coincided with a significant change in the microbial community associated with the anode from being dominated by epsilonproteobacteria to a more diverse community with representatives from deltaproteobacteria, epsilonproteobacteria, firmicutes, and flavobacterium/cytophaga/bacterioides (FCB). The highest levels of power delivered by the chambered BMFC would meet the energy requirements of many oceanographic sensors marketed today. In addition, these BMFCs did not exhibit signs of electrochemical passivation or progressive substrate depletion as is often observed with buried anodes. Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2008.

TI  - Costs of CO2 disposal options
AB  - The cost of CO2 disposal may represent a large part of the cost of any "Low CO2 Power Generation" system. Disposal options, considered in this paper, are to pipe the CO2 as a liquid to disused oil/gas fields or to the deep ocean or to pipe an aqueous solution of CO2 to the ocean. British Coal have employed an engineering contractor, Bechtel Ltd, to estimate the cost of pipelines to dispose of the CO2 produced from a conceptual 500 MWe power station in the UK East Midlands. Three options were considered:- â€¢ a pipeline to a North Sea gas field â€¢ a pipeline to the nearest enclosed ocean basin with a depth greater than 4000m and a still height of greater than 400 m â€¢ a pipeline to beyond the continental shelf. Designs were developed taking into account pipeline route, safety, maintenance, geology and topography. Installation of the overland pipes is conventional. For the continental shelf section, lay-barge technology is established for the size of pipes specified. The deep sea section presents new frontiers in lay-barge technology and capacity but it is believed that, with upgrading of equipment, the capability to lay such a pipe could probably be developed. Costs were developed for the overland, continental shelf, and deep sea sections of pipeline. The results of this exercise show that pipeline costs range from Â£ 1 2 - 3 4 million per kilometre. For the option involving disposal of an aqueous solution of CO2 the pipeline cost dominates, so this concept is only applicable to locations where the continental shelf is narrow. This study is part of British Coal's programme of work on Low CO2 Power Generation. Other aspects of the programme include the calculation of the marginal cost of CO2 removal at the power plant site. The cost of CO2 transport is added to the cost of removal to give the overall cost of CO2 abatement. These costs range from Â£20-Â£120 per tonne of CO2 emission avoided, depending on the type of power plant and the CO2 separation and disposal options chosen. Â© 1993.

TI  - Simple ways to improve power plant performance and environmental compatibility through cryogenic fuel utilization
AB  - Natural Gas is often liquefied (LNG) for its transport by ships over long distances. In order to prepare it for further transport by pipelines it has to be reduced again in gaseous state, normally by heating it with sea water. A similar technology is envisaged for long-distance transport of Hydrogen as an energy carrier. Two power plants with integration of the re-gasification process are proposed: the first proposal is a Hydrogen-fired steam power plant, while the second considers the use of LNG in an oxy-combustion arrangement with subsequent CO2 separation. Both power plants are of the reactive type, and use the heat sink provided by the cryogenic fuel and oxidant for heat rejection. Since CO2 removal is to be included in the steam power plant, the heat sink is in this case integrated in the compressor train of the separated carbon dioxide. These power plants seem suitable for peak load energy production. The power cycle performance was verified in both proposed cases by exergy analysis.

TI  - Actual field corrosion rate of offshore structures in the Baltic Sea along depth profile from water surface to sea bed
AB  - The paper presents the results of field electrochemical investigations on the corrosion rate of carbon steel in seawater of the Baltic Sea at the location of the Baltic Beta production rig. The measurements were conducted throughout the year in seawater at different depths from the sea surface to the sea bed (about 75 m). The results revealed corrosion aggressiveness of the seawater along the entire depth profile. There was no multiple decrease in the corrosion rate of carbon steel at deeper levels (below 15 m), which had been observed in the literature reporting the investigations in the seas and oceans of higher salinity (3.5%) than southern Baltic Sea (about 0.8%). A model for monitoring water physico-chemical parameters along a depth profile showed the presence of a substantial amount of oxygen far below the sea surface, which translated into high corrosion aggressiveness of the Baltic seawater. Throughout the year corrosion rate is higher than 0.8 mm/year at the sea surface and even 0.4 mm/year at the sea bed. Presented results can constitute a guideline for the design of the anticorrosion protection systems for offshore wind farms or oil and gas production platforms in the Baltic Sea region. Â© 2022

TI  - Natural gas pressurized liquefaction process adopting cascade refrigeration and CO2 removal by anti-sublimation
AB  - To reduce the area of offshore liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, a novel natural gas pressurized liquefaction process combined with CO2 removal is put forward in this paper. Taking off CO2 pretreatment facility, the process uses a crystallizer to remove CO2 from natural gas by anti-sublimation during liquefaction process. The process adopts a cascade refrigeration cycle to obtain cooling energy and produce pressurized liquefied natural gas (PLNG), with dry ice as by-product. Because of higher liquefaction temperature in PLNG process, the three-stage cascade refrigeration cycle commonly used in conventional process is replaced by a CH 4/C2H4 two-stage cycle in the proposed process. The natural gas with high CO2 content is firstly cooled at the pressure of about 1.5MPa, until the CO2 fraction is lowered to 0.5%. In this way, most of the CO2 in the feed gas is separated by anti-sublimation. To avoid further freeze-out in the following process, the remaining natural gas is compressed to a higher pressure, and then cooled down until it is liquefied. The performance of the process is simulated with HYSYS software. Taking unit product power consumption as the major index for analysis, the optimum parameters of the process are worked out in this paper. Besides, the effects of CO2 content on power consumption are also investigated, and the results indicate that higher CO2 content in feed gas leads to higher unit product power consumption. Moreover, the optimal values of unit product power consumption show that the novel process can liquefy natural gas at an acceptable energy cost, usually under 0.35 kWh/Nm 3. Therefore, the novel process is a good option for offshore natural gas liquefaction.

TI  - Performance analysis and comparison of membrane permeation versus supersonic separators for CO2 removal from a plausible natural gas of libra field, Brazil
AB  - Libra Field is a giant oil and gas offshore field situated in Santos Basin, at 200 km from southeastern Brazil coast, 2200 m water depth and 5 km crust depth. The product of Libra is a 27API oil with a remarkable characteristic: an impressive gas/oil ratio of approximately 600 sm3/m3 with a CO2 content over 40%mol. The extraction of this oil obligates the processing of such CO2 rich gas, which must end with the reinjection of all CO2 into the field for environmental reasons and to sustain oil production. The removal of CO2 and adequate destination of specified gas with minimum footprint due to space and weight constraints in offshore platforms and energy consumption configure a central challenge in the Libra scenario. A strategy involves the separation of CO2 from natural gas at the platform and the transportation of the processed gas to shore via pipelines. Four alternatives of topside gas conditioning are assessed in terms of final gas quality and energy demand, using a professional process simulator. The conventional alternative (A) selects a Membrane Permeation (MP) train including TEG Dehydration and JT Expansion for respectively adjusting water dew-point and hydrocarbon dew-point. Case B is devised by using only a Supersonic Separator (3S) to treat the gas. The third alternative (C) uses 3S for dew points adjustment and MP for CO2 removal. Case D also involves TEG absorption and JT Expansion, however, CO2 removal is accomplished by a 3S. The results show that Case B could not completely specify the gas stream, practically not changing the CO2 content. Case C is considered an improvement of Case A, since it employed much less equipment and still presented a better quality natural gas, with 68% more liquid extraction and 18% less energy consumption. Both cases reduced CO2 content to nearly 20%mol. Case D confirms the potential application of 3S for CO2 removal from a dry gas at extremely low temperatures. The final gas CO2 content was slightly higher (24%mol) and the energy demand increased 23% regarding case A, due to the high pressure required. However, the CO2 rich stream in this case is at higher pressure, which means less compression power required for reinjection application. Copyright 2015, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Electricity generation from wetlands with activated carbon bioanode
AB  - Paddy fields are potential non-tidal wetlands to apply Plant Microbial Fuel Cell (PMFC) technology. World widely they cover about 160 million ha of which 13.3 million ha is located in Indonesia. With the PMFC, in-situ electricity is generated by a bioanode with electrochemically active bacteria which use primary the organic matter supplied by the plant (e.g. as rhizodeposits and plant residues). One of limitations when installing a PMFC in a non-idal wetland is the usage of ``expensive{''} large amounts of electrodes to overcome the poor conductivity of wet soils. However, in a cultivated wetland such as rice paddy field, it is possible to alter soil composition. Adding a conductive carbon material such as activated carbon is believed to improve soil conductivity with minimum impact on plant vitality. The objective of this research was to study the effect of activated carbon as an alternative bioanode material on the electricity output and plants vitality. Lab result shows that activated carbon can be a potential alternative for bioanode material. It can continuously deliver current on average 1.54 A/m3 anode (0.26 A/m2 PGA or 66 mW/m2 PGA) for 98 days. Based on this result the next step is to do a test of this technology in the real paddy fields.

TI  - Acid gas Removal System for Tangga Barat Cluster gas development - case study
AB  - This paper discusses challenges in developing high CO2 gas fields based on project execution of Tangga Barat Cluster, the very first high CO2 gas cluster being developed offshore Peninsular Malaysia by PETRONAS Carigali. Discussion focuses on the intricacy and challenges specifically on designing offshore facilities to accommodate one of the largest Acid Gas Removal System (AGRS) offshore. It addresses steps and considerations in decision making, reaching the most advantageous solutions, in designing the AGRS as well as the overall facilities which involves the required supporting utilities. Data from well tests, FORGAS simulations, and process model from HYSYS among others shall be woven in the discussion. The discussions on the executed design strategy shall benefit future high CO2 gas fields projects by providing at the very least, a design guidance. The paper highlights the modus operandi in ensuring the final gas specifications of 8 mole% CO 2 is met while accommodating different AGRS technology provider utilities requirements. The membrane technology was identified for the bulk CO2 removal of 35% down to 8% CO2 in sales gas. Due to distinctive differences in the technology provider's removal processes, several factors were considered in designing the process utilities, electrical, mechanical and structural aspect of the system. The overall project economics for hydrocarbon losses in both single and two stage systems were assessed to reach a decision with acceptable losses. The operating conditions of the AGRS were optimized through the analysis of the reservoirs pressure and the booster compressor optimization. In view of the high development costs associated with these acidic fields, it is the author's intent to contribute, to some degree, lessons learnt in the planning, design and execution for future acidic field developments. It is aspired that through costs, time and resources optimization, the overall project economics can be improved. Copyright 2008. Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - Use of thermally sprayed aluminium (TSA) coatings to protect offshore structures in submerged and splash zones
AB  - In this work, the behaviour of arc-sprayed aluminium (1050) coatings was investigated under full artificial seawater immersion and compared with simulated splash zone conditions under droplets of artificial seawater exposed to controlled conditions. To gain a better insight into the mechanism of corrosion of thermally sprayed coatings, tests were also performed on 1050 aluminium sheet. The effectiveness of TSA coatings was evaluated using electrochemical techniques and corrosion products were examined by SEM/EDX and Raman spectroscopy. Sulphur containing corrosion products, such as felsobanyaite, were found on the coating as well as on the Al sheet. This highlights the importance of using seawater, and not NaCl solutions, as a corrosive medium simulating marine environment. Moreover, it was observed that cathodic and anodic regions on thermally sprayed coatings were not easily distinguishable, whereas on Al sheet, cathodic areas were located in the spreading region, where carbonate corrosion product (dawsonite) was detected. Full immersion studies revealed the need for pre-exposing samples before electrochemical testing, in order to predict the long-term behaviour of the coating in marine service.

TI  - CO2 Subsea Separation: Concept \& Control Strategies
AB  - The high CO2 content found in Pre-Salt offshore oil fields has led to cost-energetically processes for CO2 removal and destination. In this paper, an innovative and promising alternative subsea separation process (SSP) was proposed. Since a CO2 rich phase is expected at reservoir conditions, subsea gravity separators can be employed avoiding large volumes of CO2 from being sent to the topside, lowering gas processing plant complexity. A differential algebraic system of equations (DAE) was developed for the SSP modeling. Design and steady-state simulations were carried out within EMSO simulator. To ensure the process variables remain at their desirable values two control strategies, PID and Linear Model Predictive Control (MPC), were compared. The proposed process showed technical feasibility with up to 62\% GOR reduction. The control strategies presented reasonable performance. MPC had for most of the controlled variables a better performance. (C) 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effect of gradient magnetic field on corrosion of carbon steel pipes in seawater pumped storage power plants
AB  - Seawater pumped storage power plants are one of the most important means of maintaining a stable operation of power systems in coastal areas. However, the development of seawater pumped storage power plants has been constrained by the extreme corrosiveness of seawater. The typical material of transmission pipes in these power plants is carbon steel due to its corrosion resistance and low cost. A magnetic field has an impact on corrosion. In this paper, the corrosion affection of carbon steel pipes in seawater under a magnetic field is investigated. The corrosion current and corrosion potential on the surface of carbon steel pipes under different magnetic fields are analyzed and compared through finite element model and electrochemical experiment. The results of the two methods are in excellent accordance, demonstrating that the direction and gradient of the magnetic field around carbon steel significantly impact corrosion behavior. The magnetic field perpendicular to the reaction surface of carbon steel promotes corrosion, and the influence of the magnetic field on corrosion is more significant with the increase of the magnetic field gradient.

TI  - Determining liquid carry over in gas condensate production facilities and assessing the flow regime in the gas sweetening carbon dioxide amine units offshore on the sleipner platform in the North Sea
AB  - The produced gas from Sleipner West field area contains up to 9.5 % carbon dioxide 1, 2 and is almost free of hydrogen sulfide. Gas handling facilities on the platform were designed to reduce the level of CO2 to the export criteria of 2.5%. During the start up phase of production and the three years of operation period that followed, the required level of carbon dioxide removal of 2.5% was not achieved, and in most cases the CO2 level in the gas export was averaging 3.5% or higher. Although the slightly higher level of CO2 in the gas export did not cause any major problem, since the export stream from Sleipner West production is mixed up with relatively carbon dioxide free gas (less than 1.0%) from the main Sleipner East production area, it was important to provide complete flexibility in the Sleipner West gas treatment facilities to meet the export criteria of 2.5% CO2. Poor performance of the amine absorbers in removing the CO2 in the gas phase was thought to be related to the condensate build up in the amine solution. Significant foam build up in the amine absorbers was a good indication of condensate build up caused by carry over and / or condensate retrograded in the pipe work between the different vessels. Organic, aqueous and gas based radioactive tracers were used extensively in the gas processing facilities and the carbon dioxide removal gas sweetening plant on Sleipner West treatment production platform (SLT) in the North Sea. The use of radioactive tracer techniques within the platform facilities provided semi quantitative data on the level of the liquid carry over from the condensate stabilization process train to the gas plant over a period of three years. In addition, by utilizing the technique in the amine absorbers within the carbon dioxide removal plant, a clearer picture of the flow regime within the tower emerged and was developed. Using the data generated from these studies, as well as plant and system performance data, a full assessment of the poor CO2 removal efficiency was carried out in order to identify the potential problem and determine the required and necessary modifications to the treatment facilities on SLT. A combination of plant offshore studies, process simulation, laboratory analysis and radioactive tracer studies were utilized to identify and rectify the problem. The data generated from the latter studies were considered an important part in developing an understanding of the problem in the process system on Sleipner West treatment plant. This paper addresses the approach used in utilizing the radioactive tracer techniques in providing a tool for determining carry over and flow regime within the process vessels.

TI  - Emit now, mitigate later? Earth system reversibility under overshoots of different magnitudes and durations
AB  - Anthropogenic CO2 emissions cause irreversible climate change on centennial to millennial timescales, yet current mitigation efforts are insufficient to limit global warming to a level that is considered safe. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) has been suggested as an option to partially reverse climate change and to return the Earth system to a less dangerous state after a period of temperature overshoot. Whether or to what extent such partial reversal of climate change under CDR would happen is, next to socio-economic feasibility and sustainability, key to assessing CDR as a mitigation option. Here, we use a state-of-The-Art Earth system model that includes a representation of permafrost carbon to investigate the reversibility of the Earth system after overshoots of different durations and magnitudes in idealized simulations. We find that atmospheric CO2 concentrations are slightly lower after an overshoot, compared to a reference simulation without overshoot, due to a near-perfect compensation of carbon losses from land by increased ocean carbon uptake during the overshoot periods. The legacy of an overshoot is, on a centennial timescale, indiscernible (within natural variability) from a reference case without overshoot for many aspects of the Earth system including global average surface temperature, marine and terrestrial productivity, strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, surface ocean pH, surface O2 concentration, and permafrost extent, except in the most extreme overshoot scenario considered in this study. Consistent with previous studies, we find irreversibility in permafrost carbon and deep ocean properties like seawater temperature, pH, and O2 concentrations. We do not find any indication of tipping points or self-reinforcing feedbacks that would put the Earth system on a significantly different trajectory after an overshoot. Hence, the effectiveness of CDR in partially reversing large-scale patterns of climate change might not be the main issue of CDR but rather the impacts and risks that would occur during the period of elevated temperatures during the overshoot.

TI  - Trace Metal Evidence for Deglacial Ventilation of the Abyssal Pacific and Southern Oceans
AB  - The deep ocean has long been recognized as the reservoir that stores the carbon dioxide (CO2) removed from the atmosphere during Pleistocene glacial periods. The removal of glacial atmospheric CO2 into the ocean is likely modulated by an increase in the degree of utilization of macronutrients at the sea surface and enhanced storage of respired CO2 in the deep ocean, known as enhanced efficiency of the biological pump. Enhanced biological pump efficiency during glacial periods is most easily documented in the deep ocean using proxies for oxygen concentrations, which are directly linked to respiratory CO2 levels. We document the enhanced storage of respired CO2 during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in the Pacific Southern Ocean and deepest Equatorial Pacific using records of deglacial authigenic manganese, which form as relict peaks during increases in bottom water oxygen (BWO) concentration. These peaks are found at depths and regions where other oxygenation histories have been ambiguous, due to diagenetic alteration of authigenic uranium, another proxy for BWO. Our results require that the entirety of the abyssal Pacific below approximately 1,000Â m was enriched in respired CO2 and depleted in oxygen during the LGM. The presence of authigenic Mn enrichment in the deep Equatorial Pacific for each of the last five deglaciations suggests that the storage of respired CO2 in the deep ocean is a ubiquitous feature of late-Pleistocene ice ages.

TI  - Removal of CO2 from a submersible atmosphere by scrubbing with water-Experiments in a single column
AB  - In order to explore methods of removing CO2 from submersible habitats with sea water, gas scrubbing experiments (using tap water, and tap water with 3.5 wt\% sea salt) were performed in a 108 mm i.d. pilot-scale column, investigating the removal efficiency of CO2 (e.g. at 2 vol\%) from a gaseous stream. The performance of this column fitted with 5 spray nozzles was compared with a column packed with 1/8th in. Dixon rings (packing depth = 1480 mm). More detailed experiments were then performed in the column packed with Dixon rings at: liquid flows from 4 to 8 dm(3) min(-1); gas flows 18 and 36 N dm(3) min(-1), column pressures =1 and 4bar(g); column temperatures approximately 5 and 17 degrees C. In general, CO2 removal increased as column operating pressure was increased, or fluid temperature was decreased. When approaching low gas outlet CO2 levels at the top of the column (e.g. 0.1 vol\%), the concentration of carbonate species in the tap water (fed into the column) restricted further improvements in the performance of the column. In experiments in a short column with Dixon rings (packing depth =180 mm), using fresh water in each column, the performance of a multi-column eight chamber compact scrubber was simulated, and shown to be significantly better than a single tall column.

This paper describes a joint program by Chevron, statoil and Glitsch involving the installation, operating experience and performance of a prototype HIGEE at Chevron's Judge Digby Gas Treating Plant near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The HIGEE operated at 1000psig and processed up to 20 MMSCFD of gas for dehydration and for bulk CO2 removal. Because the absorption of CO2 by amines is often reaction rate controlled it was thought that the short residence times employed within the HIGEE may be insufficient to achieve adequate CO2 removal. This proved not to be the case. Copyright 1989, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - Corrosion resistance behavior of PVA/TiO2 composite in 3.5% NaCl
AB  - Marine structures come into contact with the seawater. Corrosion occurs on the walls of these structures and can quickly lead from surface damage to aesthetics impairment. The main cause of the corrosiveness are chloride ions which facilitate initiation and propagation of pits. Stainless steels provide a wide range of applications in seawater environments. They are used for the construction of heat exchangers, tanks and capacitors for electrical systems, refrigeration systems for power plants, tidal power, wind turbines localized at sea. Mild steel find its role in almost every product created from metal due to its low cost and easy availability. The polymeric materials are having multiple adsorption sites for bonding with metal surface and provides higher inhibition efficiency than the corresponding monomers. In the present work, the corrosion inhibition of mild steel in 3.5% NaCl by polyvinyl alcohol/TiO2 composites were studied. The composite samples were characterized by using XRD, FTIR and SEM. Potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic techniques were used to explore the enhanced corrosion inhibition of composites. The corrosion inhibition efficiency of PVTi composites were found to increase with increase in concentration of TiO2. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Key impacts of climate engineering on biodiversity and ecosystems, with priorities for future research
AB  - Climate change has significant implications for biodiversity and ecosystems. With slow progress towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions, climate engineering (or geoengineering') is receiving increasing attention for its potential to limit anthropogenic climate change and its damaging effects. Proposed techniques, such as ocean fertilization for carbon dioxide removal or stratospheric sulfate injections to reduce incoming solar radiation, would significantly alter atmospheric, terrestrial and marine environments, yet potential side-effects of their implementation for ecosystems and biodiversity have received little attention. A literature review was carried out to identify details of the potential ecological effects of climate engineering techniques. A group of biodiversity and environmental change researchers then employed a modified Delphi expert consultation technique to evaluate this evidence and prioritize the effects based on the relative importance of, and scientific understanding about, their biodiversity and ecosystem consequences. The key issues and knowledge gaps are used to shape a discussion of the biodiversity and ecosystem implications of climate engineering, including novel climatic conditions, alterations to marine systems and substantial terrestrial habitat change. This review highlights several current research priorities in which the climate engineering context is crucial to consider, as well as identifying some novel topics for ecological investigation.

In this work, Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95-Li2CO3-Na2CO3 (GDC-LNC) ceramic-carbonate dual-phase membranes for electrochemical separation of CO2 were fabricated by a novel phase-inversion combined with carbonate solidification method. The Li/Na elements were left in the GDC ceramic due to the carbonation solution mixed with water as curing agent to solidify supports, which may modify the wettability of GDC with LNC. The maximum CO2 flux reached as much as 0.301 mL min(-1)cm(-2) and the GDC-LNC dual-phase membranes exhibit stable CO2 permeation, suggesting a promising prospect towards future carbon storage and separation applications.

TI  - Membrane contactors for the absorption of carbon dioxide from gaseous streams: State of the art on membrane improvements
AB  - Carbon dioxide is usually removed from gas streams by means of packed towers, in which the stream to be treated is put in contact with an absorbent liquid particularly selective for CO2. However, many are the drawbacks of these devices. For example, a large active contact area is required to obtain good CO2 removals, thereby implying the use of big absorption towers. Moreover, the direct contact of the gas stream with the liquid absorbent can lead to several issues. One is the entrainment of the extractant by the gas phase. There are also the problems of production of emulsions, foaming, flooding, channeling, and unloading. In the past years, the potentialities of membrane contactors, as alternative units to carry out an efficient separation, have been investigated by many researchers. Membrane contactors are based on the use of microporous membranes that act as inert barriers between the gas and the liquid streams, allowing their contact at each micropore, while avoiding their mixing. In this way, the problems of flooding, foaming, loading, and liquid entrainment are solved. It is also possible to ensure a well-defined and stable interfacial area between the gas and the absorbent [1]. Moreover, since each membrane micropore is a point of contact for the two phases and having each membrane a huge number of micropores, the interfacial area available for the mass transfer is higher than that of packed tower. The typical interfacial area per unit of volume of membrane contactors is in the range of 1500-3000 m2/m3, whereas for conventional devices, this ratio is between 100 and 800 m2/m3 [2]. This would imply that the same separation could be carried out in a more compact system. A reduction of size is crucial for offshore applications, where it is often very difficult to install packed towers. Furthermore, the typical low volume and weight of membrane contactors allow their easy integration into existing installations. Finally, their modular design is also attractive from the point of view of process intensification. In literature, the researches made on the application of membrane contactors to the removal of carbon dioxide from gaseous streams have analyzed the role of different parameters on the performance of the process, such as membrane properties, type and concentration of absorbents, membrane module design, and operating temperature and pressures. This contribution would like to provide a brief summary of the main problems/critical aspects underlined in the studies made during the years 2005-2012 that future research must overcome in order to make possible the application of membrane contactors at industrial scale. Then, the researches on the development of membranes with improved properties are reported and discussed in more details. Only nondispersive extraction membrane contactors are considered, while supported liquid membranes and fixed carrier membranes are not included. Â© 2015 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Using electrochemical process to mineralize CO2 and separate Ca2+/Mg2+ ions from hard water to produce high value-added carbonates
AB  - CO2 mineralization is a promising utilization option for reducing CO2 emissions. Hard water (e.g. seawater, salt water and brine) rich in Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions, has potential for fixation of CO2. But to date there is no effective way to use these ions for CO2 mineralization. In this paper, a novel method based on membrane electrolysis was proposed and used for carbonation and separation of calcium and magnesium ions from hard water in low voltage. Compared with traditional electrolysis, membrane electrolysis can reduce the voltage by about 1.3 V, which reducing the energy consumption for CO2 mineralization dramatically. This method was proved effective to remove the Ca2+/Mg2+ ions from hard water. And CO2 was finally transformed into marketable pure magnesium carbonate and precipitated calcium carbonate. According to this study, 1000 m(3) of concentrated seawater could mineralize 4.65 tons of CO2. In addition, 9.97 tons of magnesium carbonate hydroxide and 2.02 tons of precipitated calcium carbonate could be produced with only a total electric power consumption of 5676 kWh. Therefore, this method affords a new route for CO2 mineralization by transforming hard water into high value-added industrial products with low energy consumption.

TI  - Gas processes 2000: Separex membrane systems
AB  - Separex membrane systems of UOP LLC are used for removing CO2 and water vapor from natural gas or associated gas to meet pipeline specifications for onshore or offshore locations, upgrading low GHV gas for fuel, hydrogen recovery from EOR floods for CO2 reinjection, etc. As the CO2-rich feed gas mixture passes over the polymeric membrane at high pressure, it separates into two streams. Carbon, H2S, and water vapor permeate readily through the membrane collecting on the low-pressure permeate side. Methane, ethane, other hydrocarbons, and N2 enrich in the high-pressure residual gas. Separex membrane systems offer two membrane module configurations (spiral wound and hollow fiber) to satisfy the varied CO2 removal requirements. Hydrocarbon recovery can be â‰¤ 99% for a two-stage design and 95% for a single stage without compression, depending upon feed composition, pressure levels, system configuration, and product requirements. Feedrates vary from 1 to 1000 million scf/day, with CO2 levels of 3-70%, and feed pressures of 400-1400 psig.

TI  - Desalination as a negative emissions technology
AB  - To limit global warming, governments and industries are engaged in reducing emissions of CO2. There is increasing evidence, however, that it may be necessary to go a step further by removing CO2 already emitted. For the purpose of carbon dioxide removal (CDR), a number of negative emissions technologies (NET) have been proposed. These generally make extensive usage of land, energy and water - if they are to be implemented at the large scales needed. It is therefore important to seek, investigate and compare alternative approaches to NET. Desalination plants, though normally seen as sources rather than sinks of CO2, could be modified to provide a new type of NET. In this study, we propose treating desalination reject brine by electrolysis to form Mg(OH)(2) and thus absorb CO2 via the oceans. The energy and water penalties associated with the electrolysis are calculated as 1.8 GJ per tCO(2) and 13.7 m(3) per tCO(2) respectively, making it an interesting option in comparison with some other types of NET. However, NET-modification more than doubles the specific energy consumption of a reverse-osmosis desalination plant. It is concluded that NET-desalination has potential to contribute to CDR in arid countries (especially if solar energy is used) thus helping to meet Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) following the COP21 summit.

TI  - Process optimisation in acid gas removal system
AB  - This paper mainly describes challenges in process design and operation optimization of Acid Gas Removal System with membrane separation technology in developing high CO2 gas fields. It concentrates on techniques and applications being used in CO2 Removal System of Arthit Offshore Processing Plant located in the Gulf of Thailand in which PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited (PTTEP) is an operator. This plant was designed based on export gas at 363 MMscfd with feed CO2 up to 40% and lower down to 23% in Sales gas. It is imperative for optimized CO2 Removal operations since it can minimize revenue losses as well as hydrocarbon releases to environment resulting in lower greenhouse gas emission. Formal methods are established for troubleshooting in case of %CO2 feed deviation from design, failure to meet sales gas specification, and high hydrocarbon losses. Membrane area adjustment was firstly implemented to match with feed CO2, and then performed operating condition optimization. The effects of the following factors which are very sensitive to the performance were examined such as: feed temperature, feed pressure, permeate pressure, feed flow rate and membrane area. Several performance tests were performed not only to fine-tune the best operating point, but also to analyze the effect of changing operating parameters in order to develop operating guideline for CO2 Removal process adjustment. This paper also discusses in the methodology to corroborate performance of membrane element which are carried out in order to minimize the loss of hydrocarbon gas as well as the costs of membrane element change-out. It is worthwhile for operators and engineers to translate the information gathers to serve as operating guidance to optimize process condition and maximize performance of Acid Gas Removal Units which can be certainly benefit to other fields with high CO2.

TI  - Streamlined natural gas treatment by membranes only
AB  - Offshore gas treatment faces constraints for space and weight limits. This paper will present an innovative concept of using only membranesto remove multiple contaminants, reduce weight, space and cost on offshore installations and becoming an enabler for gas monetization. Membrane separation is a cost effective way to remove CO2 from natural gas. The typical offshore membrane treatment package usually consists of a relatively complex pre-treatment step followed by a simple membrane system to remove CO2. The solution using only membranes for gas treatment consists of: â€¢ a first stage of poly (ether ether ketone) or PEEK membranes, resistant to the main impurities in natural gas, able to remove H2S, heavy hydrocarbons and water, thus essentially replacing the pretreatment for offshore CO2 removal membrane packages â€¢ a second stage of poly-imide membranes with high CO2 / CH4 selectivity for CO2 removal The membrane-only solution can be applied for treatment of large volumes of gas for pipeline specification to remove CO2 and other contaminants. Key benefits are simplicity of operation, compactness of footprint, weight reduction and a reduction in or elimination of adsorbent media replacements. Topside weight and cost reduction can increase gas treatment capacity and flexibility and are an enabler for gas monetization. Due to their resistance to impurities PEEK membranes can also be used to treat flared gas for valorization through gas-to-power applications, thus reducing flaring. For gas-to-power applications, the gas will undergo some basic conditioning (such as hydrocarbons dew point, BTU adjustment, H2S removal) by a compact membrane unit to be used for power generation on the offshore platform.

TI  - Hyperbaric testing of an alternative approach to remove carbon dioxide from underwater life support equipment
AB  - Traditional CO2 absorption methods for underwater life support equipment use alkali metal hydroxide chemical beds- mostly calcium hydroxide-that have been shown to have poor absorption efficiencies at cold temperatures, and must be replaced at considerable trouble and expense on a frequent basis. With chemical utilizations as low as 20% in water temperatures of 2Â°C, these hydroxides do not lend themselves to applications requiring extended durations in cold water due to the inability to carry sufficient quantities of expendables. A joint research effort between Duke University and the University of Bath has verified the feasibility in laboratory trials of an alternative carbon dioxide removal method that intimately mixes seawater with breathing circuit gases within a packed bed of Dixon rings. Based on the results of these laboratory trials, two multi-path scrubber prototypes were designed and fabricated for unmanned testing. In March 2013, the hyperbaric performance of these prototype scrubbers was characterized over a wide range of gas and water flow rates when operating the scrubbers in counter-current (water flowing in the opposite direction as gas flow) and co-current (water flowing in the same direction as gas flow) fashion. Significant findings from these tests included the following: Both scrubber prototypes were found to be capable of delivering exit CO2 levels below 0.5 vol% (surface equivalent) at respiratory rates up to 22.5 liters per minute and at depths ranging from 0 to 40 meters of seawater (MSW). Negligible collateral O2 absorption was observed at surface pressure (exit O2 levels were typically above 20.2 vol%), and exit O2 levels were typically above 18.4% during testing at 10 MSW. At surface pressure, both prototypes had significantly lower breathing resistances than design goals established by the U. S. Navy. Copyright Â© 2014 by ASME.

TI  - Effects of temperature, concentration and synergism on green Schiff bases synthesized from vanillin in applications as corrosion inhibitors for carbon steel in well stimulation
AB  - Mild carbon steel is widely used in construction materials owing to its relatively low price, ease of manufacture and high tensile strength. When it is subjected to an aggressive environment, the use of efficient corrosion inhibitors is required. The offshore oil and gas industry apply well stimulation techniques employing strong acids (5-35 wt\%), which severely damage metallic structures. Conventional inhibitors may result in environmental and human health problems. In order to avoid that, green compounds have been widely investigated. However in certain applications, such as materials for offshore installations, protection is afforded by multi-component formulations. The synergistic effect of formulations is achieved by the active compounds, intensifiers, surfactants and solvents. Thus the performance of three Schiff bases synthesized from vanillin, a green aldehyde, and aromatic amines was investigated in corrosion inhibition of carbon steel. Weight loss measurements were made in 2 M and 15\% HCl over a 313K-353K temperature range in concentrations between 0.4\%wt./v and 1.0\%wt./v. Effects of binary and ternary mixtures in 15\% HCl revealed an increased efficiency for isolated inhibitors at higher concentrations. The addition of potassium iodide enhanced efficiency to 97.78\% in 15\% HCl at 333 K. Electrochemical tests indicated mixed-type inhibitors. Surface analysis confirmed the presence of a protective film as well as reduced carbon steel roughness. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed the effects of a substituent on structural and electronic properties in the neutral and acid phases. The role of a sulfur atom in preventing corrosion was also addressed by DFT calculations.

TI  - A performance assessment of a chemical based technology for the dissub CO2 removal system in Royal Navy submarines using computational fluid dynamic modelling
AB  - Having identified a deficiency in the Royal Navy's present DIStressed SUBmarine (DISSUB) Carbon Dioxide (CO2) removal system the Marine Environment Sustainability and Habitability (MESH) Integrated Project Team (IPT) (now Maritime Equipment Transformation (MET)) has run a project to select and install a new CO2 removal system. This uses a chemical based technology in the form of Reactive Polymer Curtains (RPCs) to absorb CO 2 from the air. In order to maximise the potential benefits and better inform the deployment of this product, Frazer-Nash Consultancy has been contracted by MESH IPT to undertake a study using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to numerically simulate the airflow and CO2 absorption reaction in a realistic survival situation in the forward compartment of a T-Class submarine. This paper reports the results of an assessment of the proposed deployment strategy for the RPCs based on the CO2 levels throughout the compartment, with particular attention to the CO2 levels around the crew. This will provide an input to the guidelines for deployment of RPCs in survival conditions. Copyright Â© 2008 SAE International.

TI  - Application of water scrubbing technique for biogas upgrading in a microchannel
AB  - Biogas, produced as a result of anaerobic degradation of organic matter, is an alternative source of renewable energy and a sustainable and cost-effective fuel due to its high availability However, before it can be used as an energy source, biogas must be upgraded by removing impurities such as CO2 and H2S to increase its calorific value. In this study, CO2 was removed and synthetic biogas was upgraded at atmospheric pressure in a microchannel using three absorbents of well water, seawater, and drinking water. The effects of operating variables, including absorbent flow rate, biogas flow rate, and system temperature, were investigated. As a function of independent variables, RSM analysis proposed a quadratic model for the absorption process by each absorbent to predict the response (CO2 removal efficiency). Moreover, the experimental values obtained for CO2 absorption were found to satisfactorily match the model values (R2=0.9991âˆ’0.9997). The maximum CO2 absorption in well water, seawater, and drinking water at 30 Â°C, liquid flow rate of 150 mlÂ·hâˆ’1, and gas flow rate of 50 mlÂ·minâˆ’1 was 90.22, 84.95, and 79.66, respectively.

TI  - SYSTEM-ANALYSIS OF CO2 REMOVAL FROM THERMAL ELECTRIC-POWER PLANTS AND STORAGE IN DEEP-SEA
AB  - Thermal power plants located in Japan, burning coal, petroleum, LNG or methanol, were analyzed here from the viewpoint of the energy balance and the overall CO2 emission, including the emission from the fuel treatment stage such as the mining of fossil fuels, transportation, and the post-combustion stage such as CO2 removal and storage. The reduction of the net CO2 emission by CO2 removal and storage is the largest for the coal fired plant of others, but the decrease in the energy efficiency is also the largest. This result suggests that if there is not any problems for supplying coal, CO2 removal and storage should be equipped on the coal fired plants to mitigate the global warming.

TI  - Corrosion prevention for the use of renewable energy
AB  - Extrapolation of primary energy consumption of the world between 1990 and 2003 will result in the complete exhaustion of oil, uranium, natural gas and coal reserves in 2030, 2038, 2040 and 2061, respectively. We are proposing global carbon dioxide recycling to use solar energy for all people in the whole world. The electricity will be generated by solar cells in the deserts and be used for production of hydrogen by seawater electrolysis at the nearby desert coasts. Hydrogen for which there is no mass transportation technology will be converted to methane at the desert coasts by the reaction with carbon dioxide recovered by energy consumers. Among systems in global carbon dioxide recycling, seawater electrolysis and methane formation have not been performed industrially. We tailored anodes for oxygen evolution without chlorine formation in seawater electrolysis, energy-saving cathodes for hydrogen production and ideal catalysts for methane formation by the reaction of carbon dioxide with hydrogen. Prevention of corrosion degradation of the key materials is the most important subject for success of the global carbon dioxide recycling. copyright The Electrochemical Society.

TI  - Space sunshades and climate change
AB  - The accelerated rate of increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations in recent years and the inability of humankind to move away from carbon-based energy system have led to the revival of the idea of counteracting global warming through geoengineering schemes. Two categories of geoengineering proposals have been suggested: solar radiation management (SRM) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods. SRM schemes would attempt to reduce the amount of solar radiation absorbed by our planet. Placing reflectors or mirrors in space, injecting aerosols into the stratosphere, and enhancing the albedo of marine clouds are some of the proposed SRM methods. In this section, the various space-based SRM methods which are likely to reduce the incoming solar radiation uniformly across the globe are discussed. In the past decade, the effects of these space sunshades on the climate system have been simulated using climate models by reducing the amount of incoming solar radiation by appropriate amounts (reduced solar constant). Key modeling results on the extent of global and regional climate change mitigation, unintended side effects, and unmitigated effects are briefly discussed.

TI  - An evaluation of large capacity processing units for ultra deep water and high GOR oil fields
AB  - A study of offshore production units with large fluids processing capacity is presented, focusing in ultra deep water scenario (higher than 2,000 m) and the production of light oil, with high Gas Oil Ratio (GOR) and CO2 contamination. This situation fits to some exploratory and production areas offshore Brazil. Taking a regular size FPSO as the comparative base, analysis explored the impacts of different processing capacities on energy demand, weight and footprint requirements. The evaluation considered two gas processing plants: the first is less complex, without CO2 separation from the produced gas, reinjecting the whole produced gas into the reservoir; the second is more complex, with CO2 removal and a more flexible plant, capable of exporting treated gas and reinjecting rich CO2 stream or the whole gas. As the driving force of CO2 separation by membranes is the pressure drop between feed gas and the permeated rich CO2 stream, the second option leads to a lower processing capacity, mainly due to the increase in compression and power demand. The risks and benefits of large production systems are also evaluated from the reservoir drainage and gathering systems point of view. One of the main constraints is the indication that for high GOR oil, considering or not CO2 separation in the processing plant, its capacity would have to be limited due to maximum topside dry weight and deck footprint that could be installed on a converted hull or a new built unit. Additionally, constraints related to maximum power generation must be taken into account. If CO2 is not removed, and the gas is reinjected with no export, a higher processing capacity could be achieved. The design of higher capacity plants shall also consider reservoir aspects, flow assurance through long tie back wells, operability, maintainability and increase in difficulty to purchase high capacity equipment, such as vessels, valves, pumps, compressors and other.

TI  - Carbon dioxide Removal via Absorption using Artificial Seawater in a Microchannel for the Case of CO2-Rich Gas
AB  - The separation of CO2 is important for upstream processing of natural gas, which generally contains high concentration of CO2. In this work, a T-microchannel was applied for the absorption of CO2 using artificial seawater as absorbent. The first part involved the optimization of operating conditions for CO2 absorption using water. The experiments were performed under the pressure of 1.7 bar and 60%V/V of CO2 was used as feed mixture. At the optimal condition (the flowrate of liquid of 1 mL/min, the flowrate of gas of 125 mL/min and the temperature of 30 Â°C), the CO2 removal was 71.14%. The optimized condition was adapted for the application of artificial seawater as absorbent. Each salt including NaCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2 was used at different concentration levels based on the natural concentration in seawater. MgCl2 solution (0.106 mol/L) provided an improvement compared to the case of pure water as absorbent. The removal efficiency and the overall liquid-side mass transfer coefficient (KLa) were 83.88% and 73.12 sâˆ’1, respectively. Therefore, seawater can be effectively utilized as absorbent for the removal of CO2. Â© 2022

TI  - Buoy-Inspired Hybridized Energy Harvester with Freestanding Dielectric Oscillator Towards Sustainable Blue Energy Harvesting
AB  - Although blue energy is the most promising renewable and carbon-free energy source, the blue energy harvesting is disturbed due to the fatal problems such as low-efficiency for the ocean wave frequency, heavy weight and massive structure, and high cost. Herein, the magnetic-levitated blue energy harvesting device (ML-BEHD), which is inspired by buoy shape, is demonstrated to harvest the wave-induced blue energy with low-frequency. The ML-BEHD is composed of the magnetic-levitated triboelectric nanogenerator (ML-TENG) and the electromagnetic generator (EMG), respectively. Due to the levitated freestanding dielectric oscillator (FDO), the friction between FDO and bottom surface of theÂ ML-BEHD is decreased. Then, the electrical output generated from the ML-TENG is increased because the mechanical energy of the FDO can be transferred to its electrode without friction-induced loss. The rectified voltage of 17Â V is generated from the ML-BEHD, which is larger than the sum of the rectified voltage generated from the ML-TENG and EMG. Furthermore, with the electrical energy stored in a 4.7 mF capacitor, the electroforming process is successfully conducted without any external power source. This result indicates that the ML-BEHD can generate the high voltage and current. Considering these results, the proposed ML-BEHD is expected to be utilized as a promising sustainable energy harvester in near future because the sufficient electricity to utilize can be generated from the ML-BEHD.

TI  - Carbon Fluxes in the Coastal Ocean: Synthesis, Boundary Processes, and Future Trends
AB  - This review examines the current understanding of the global coastal ocean carbon cycle and provides a new quantitative synthesis of air-sea CO2 exchange. This reanalysis yields an estimate for the globally integrated coastal ocean CO2 flux of -0.25 +/- 0.05 Pg C year(-1), with polar and subpolar regions accounting for most of the CO2 removal (>90\%). A framework that classifies river-dominated ocean margin (RiOMar) and ocean-dominated margin (OceMar) systems is used to conceptualize coastal carbon cycle processes. The carbon dynamics in three contrasting case study regions, the Baltic Sea, the Mid-Atlantic Bight, and the South China Sea, are compared in terms of the spatiotemporal variability of surface pCO(2). Ocean carbon models that range from box models to three-dimensional coupled circulation-biogeochemical models are reviewed in terms of the ability to simulate key processes and project future changes in different continental shelf regions. Common unresolved challenges remain for implementation of these models across RiOMar and OceMar systems. The long-term trends in coastal ocean carbon fluxes for different coastal systems under anthropogenic stress that are emerging in observations and numerical simulations are highlighted. Knowledge gaps in projecting future perturbations associated with before and after net-zero CO2 emissions in the context of concurrent changes in the land-ocean-atmosphere coupled system pose a key challenge. A new synthesis yields an estimate for a globally integrated coastal ocean carbon sink of -0.25 Pg C year(-1), with greater than 90\% of atmospheric CO2 removal occurring in polar and subpolar regions. The sustained coastal and open ocean carbon sink is vital in mitigating climate change and meeting the target set by the Paris Agreement. Uncertainties in the future coastal ocean carbon cycle are associated with concurrent trends and changes in the land-ocean-atmosphere coupled system. The major gaps and challenges identified for current coastal ocean carbon research have important implications for climate and sustainability policies.

TI  - CO2 removal from natural gas using membrane contactor
AB  - CO2 is one of the naturally occurring component in natural gas streams and its removal is crucial prior to further processing in the downstream units of gas processing plants. Some of the concerns on CO2 are related to meeting specification of gas heating value, plant piping and pipeline corrosion issues and Health, Safety and Environment (HSE). CO2 is commonly removed using acid gas absorption process (contact tower with trays/packings) and membrane technologies, where the application of these technologies in offshore facilities requires large foot print and lead to high capital and operating expenses. The potential reduction in both equipment footprint and capital investment has made membrane contactor technology a compelling solution for the removal of CO2 in natural gas. A membrane contactor is a device that allows gas-liquid mass transfer without any direct contact of the two phases which flow at different sides of the membrane. Recent findings have shown that membrane contactors have the advantages over those existing separation systems, which include smaller footprint, modular design, not sensitive to flooding, channelling or back-mixing, and provide larger contact areas for increased mass transfer rate. Realizing its potential, PETRONAS and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) have successfully completed a development study on membrane contactor which is able to remove CO2 from feed gas containing a range of 10-70% of CO2 down to as low as 1% at the outlet gas stream. The technology is potentially capable to further remove CO2 down to ppm level in meeting LNG specifications. A pilot plant to demonstrate and allow further evaluation of its performance on actual plant conditions will be commissioned at PETRONAS Gas Processing Plant in 2013.

TI  - Removal of CO2 from offshore associated gas with supergravity method
AB  - The CO2 removal effect from simulated offshore associated gas with 6% CO2 (volume fraction) and 500 mL/min gas inflow under atmospheric pressure is studied by using gas/liquid reflux supergravity machine to strength a single instantaneous absorption process of aqueous solution of TEA. When the CO2 removal rate is 80.5%, the optimum treatment conditions for single aqueous solution of TEA are:20% mass fraction of TEA, 2000 r/min of supergravity rotating speed, 30â„ƒ of temperature and 10:1 of the gas-liquid volume ratio. In order to enhance CO2 removal rate, CO2 removal experiments from simulated offshore associated gas are carried out with a mixture complex solution containing 0-20% NaOH (mass fraction) and 20% TEA (mass fraction). The results show that complex solution prepared by adding 5% NaOH (mass fraction) into 20% TEA (mass fraction) has the single instantaneous CO2 removal rate above 98%, which is higher than that of TEA solution. The continuous CO2 removal rate of the complex solution during 180-480 min is higher than the sum of the separate solution of 5% NaOH (mass fraction) and 20% TEA (mass fraction). Moreover, there is no pipe blockage phenomena caused by excessive precipitation of Na2CO3 crystal. Â© 2017, China National Chemical Information Center. All right reserved.

The processing goals with this fluid comprise: [A] water dew-point adjustment; [B] hydrocarbon dew-point adjustment; [C] decarbonation of a small part to 20%mol carbon dioxide fuel-gas for power production; and [D] compression/pumping of the remaining fluid enriched with carbon dioxide from decarbonation for enhanced oil recovery. For these tasks the industry considers traditional well established processes such as molecular-sieves adsorption for water dew-point adjustment, Joule-Thompson expansion for hydrocarbon dew-point adjustment and membrane-permeation for carbon dioxide removal. However, conventional technologies can become cumbersome in such awkward conditions. Thus, unconventional solutions are sought for reliability, lower equipment size/weight, and better power consumption, emissions and environmental sustainability. Recently, supersonic separators have been analyzed in proof-of-concept researches for natural gas processing. In this regard, this work quantitatively proves that goals [A],[B],[C] are achievable using only supersonic separators, attaining 33% higher net value, 40% greater oil production, 10% lower investment and economic leverage to reach lower carbon emission relatively to conventional counterparts.

TI  - The preparation of biomass carbon materials and its energy storage research
AB  - The energy is the material basis to support the whole process of human civilization, and it is also an integral part of modern social development basic condition. Wind, solar, tidal power, geothermal energy, and other all belonging to renewable clean energy will become the main energy source in the future. However, renewable energy generally has a large amount, low energy density, randomness, and intermittent, which cause it hard to use. In this situation, the development of efficient energy storage to meet human demand for energy is to become a hot spot in the worldwide. Electrochemical energy storage of high efficiency and low investment and the use of safe, flexible application characteristics have attracted people for the further research of this kind of energy storage methods. And lithium-ion batteries and battery as nowadays most rapid development, the paper first summarizes the development status of the existing lithium-ion battery. Then proposes a kind of by large algae biomassâ€”Enteromorpha as precursor system of lithium-ion battery cathode materials and assemble them into analog battery.

TI  - Recent advances in electrochemical co2 reduction using copper-based catalysts
AB  - Burning of fossil fuels increases CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, resulting in a series of climate-and environment-related concerns such as global warming, sea-level rise, and melting of glaciers. Therefore, utilization of renewable energy to reduce the CO2 concentration, in order to realize a sustainable development, is urgent. Capturing and utilizing CO2, a greenhouse gas, can not only address these concerns but also alleviate the current scenario of energy shortage. Thermal catalytic CO2 hydrogenation offers various pathways with high conversion efficiencies to produce fuels and industrial chemicals including CO, HCOOH, CH3OH, and CH4. However, CO2 is chemically inert due to the highly stable Cï¼O bond. Thus, harsh reaction conditions such as high temperature and pressure are required for CO2 hydrogenation. Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction using renewable electricity and water is a promising alternative to thermocatalysis. This technology can not only store and transport the intermittent solar or wind energy but can also use water as the proton source instead of H2, which is indispensable for thermal CO2 hydrogenation. Electrochemical CO2 reduction under ambient conditions is a proton-coupled electron transfer process. The key to promote the electrochemical reduction of CO2 is to develop highly selective and active catalysts with high stability. Among various CO2 electrocatalysts, copper-based catalysts have attracted significant attention and have been extensively investigated, since they exhibit good selectivity and efficiency for the reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbons and alcohols. A broad range of products, up to 16 different gases and liquids, can be obtained in the CO2 electroconversion on copper. Copper is the only metal that has a negative adsorption energy for *CO and a positive adsorption energy for *H. Thus, it has a unique property of generating &gt; 2eâˆ’ transfer products. However, selectivity of the target product is still low, especially for high value-added C2+ species (C2H4, C2H5OH, CH3COOH, CH3CHO, n-C3H7OH, etc.). The selectivity of various products on copper-based catalysts could be enhanced by surface engineering techniques such as tuning the morphologies, particle sizes, surface facets, strains levels, and atomic coordination. Electrolyte engineering could also aid in CO2 electroreduction. Therefore, improving the selectivity of C2+ products by modifying copper-based catalysts could be a hot research topic. In addition, Câ€•C coupling is a key step in forming C2+ products, though the C2+ product formation pathway is complex, and the mechanisms are still unclear. Considering these, this paper mainly reviews the research progress in copper-based catalysts producing C2+ species in the last five years. It also discusses the possible reaction mechanisms and the factors that affect the product selectivities. In the end, further research directions are proposed.

TI  - CO2 extraction from seawater using bipolar membrane electrodialysis
AB  - An efficient method for extracting the dissolved CO2 in the oceans would effectively enable the separation of CO2 from the atmosphere without the need to process large volumes of air, and could provide a key step in the synthesis of renewable, carbon-neutral liquid fuels. While the extraction of CO2 from seawater has been previously demonstrated, many challenges remain, including slow extraction rates and poor CO2 selectivity, among others. Here we describe a novel solution to these challenges - efficient CO2 extraction from seawater using bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BPMED). We characterize the performance of a custom designed and built CO2-from-seawater prototype, demonstrating the ability to extract 59% of the total dissolved inorganic carbon from seawater as CO 2 gas with an electrochemical energy consumption of 242 kJ mol -1(CO2).

TI  - Managing the risks of missing international climate targets
AB  - The Paris targets are based on assumptions that a global temperature increase of 1.5 degrees C-2 degrees C above preindustrial levels will be safe, and that the climate can be stabilized at these higher temperatures. However, global average temperatures are already measurably impacting the Earth's systems at 1.2 degrees C above preindustrial levels. Many human and environmental systems cannot adapt to higher temperatures, which may exceed critical tipping points in physical climate and ecological systems. Compounding these risks is the likelihood that the international 2 degrees C limit will be overshot due to political obstacles and systemic inertia from existing greenhouse gases, warming oceans, and the decades required to replace existing infrastructure. Moreover, the Earth energy imbalance may have to be reduced to approximately zero to stabilize the global climate (i.e., CO2 concentrations lowered to around 350 ppm.) Most IPCC mitigation scenarios assume that climate targets will be temporarily overshot, and require large-scale carbon dioxide removal [}CDR] to subsequently lower temperatures. However, many CDR methods may not be politically and/or technologically feasible, and they will act too slowly to prevent dangerous overshoot. These issues raise serious doubts about the ability of current mitigation polices to ensure safe outcomes. They also indicate the need to investigate whether rapid climate cooling measures may be required to reduce the risks associated with high temperatures during the long time it will take to decarbonize the global economy and stabilize the climate. Given the uncertainty of future mitigation success, and the potentially existential costs of failure, there is now an urgent need to examine whether or not current efforts are credible, and if not, what mitigation measures will be required to prevent dangerous overshoot and ensure a safe, stable climate. In order to develop a feasible mitigation strategy, it will be necessary to prioritize research both on climate overshoot risks, and on the relative effectiveness, risks, costs and timelines of potential mitigation and adaptation approaches. Since large scale climate interventions will be needed to prevent dangerous global warming, all plausible options need to be investigated, including carbon dioxide removal methods and technologies for rapidly cooling global temperatures. This research is a prerequisite for evaluating the comparative benefits, costs and risks of using, or not using, various forms of mitigation and adaptation, and then developing a realistic overshoot risk management plan.

TI  - Upgrading exergy utilization and sustainability via supersonic separators: Offshore processing of carbonated natural gas
AB  - Offshore processing of natural gas with 44\%mol carbon dioxide at remote deep-water oil-and-gas fields is invariably characterized by low-efficiency power generation via gas-fired turbines releasing hot flue-gas and entailing high degradation of resources, high carbon emissions and low sustainability. This work demonstrates how to upgrade exergy utilization and consequently process sustainability by using supersonic separators in some gas processing steps; namely: (i) water dew-point adjustment; (ii) hydrocarbon dew-point adjustment; and (iii) carbon dioxide abatement to 20\%mol. To accomplish this, the exergy performance of two supersonic separator gas processing alternatives are compared with conventional gas processing comprising triethylene-glycol absorption for water dew-point adjustment, Joule-Thomson expansion hydrocarbon dew-point adjustment and membrane-permeation carbon dioxide removal. Since exergy is measured relatively to a reference environmental reservoir, two such reference reservoirs are used: RER-1: standard atmosphere with 2\%mol water containing hydrocarbons at combustion chemical equilibrium with air species; and RER-2: 1atm water-saturated raw natural gas in equilibrium with liquid water. Aspen-HYSYS simulations are used to solve mass/energy balances and thermodynamic property calculations. With RER-2 the conventional gas processing conserves 63.3\% of the inlet exergy, while the two alternative supersonic separator processes attain 66.5\% and 72.4\% of exergy conservation, proving the associate gains of exergy efficiency and sustainability.
