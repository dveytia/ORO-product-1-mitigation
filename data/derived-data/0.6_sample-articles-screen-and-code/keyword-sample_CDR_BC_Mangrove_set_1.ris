TI  - Estimating Mangrove Tree Biomass and Carbon Content: A Comparison of Forest Inventory Techniques and Drone Imagery
AB  - Mangroves provide many ecosystem services including a considerable capacity to sequester and store large amounts of carbon, both in the sediment and in the above-ground biomass. Assessment of mangrove above-ground carbon stock relies on accurate measurement of tree biomass, which traditionally involves collecting direct measurements from trees and relating these to biomass using allometric relationships. We investigated the potential to predict tree biomass using measurements derived from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), or drone, imagery. This approach has the potential to dramatically reduce time-consuming fieldwork, providing greater spatial survey coverage and return for effort, and may enable data to be collected in otherwise hazardous or inaccessible areas. We imaged an Avicennia marina (grey mangrove) stand using an RGB camera mounted on a UAV. The imaged trees were subsequently felled, enabling physical measurements to be taken for traditional biomass estimation techniques, as well as direct measurements of biomass and tissue carbon content. UAV image-based tree height measurements were highly accurate (R-2 = 0.98). However, the variables that could be measured from the UAV imagery (tree height and canopy area) were poor predictors of tree biomass. Using the physical measurement data, we identified that trunk diameter is a key predictor of A. marina biomass. Unfortunately, trunk diameter cannot be directly measured from the UAV imagery, but it can be predicted (with some error) using models that incorporate other UAV image-based measurements, such as tree height and canopy area. However, reliance on second-order estimates of trunk diameter leads to increased uncertainty in the subsequent predictions of A. marina biomass, compared to using physical measurements of trunk diameter taken directly from the trees. Our study demonstrates that there is potential to use UAV-based imagery to measure mangrove A. marina tree structural characteristics and biomass. Further refinement of the relationship between UAV image-based measurements and tree diameter is needed to reduce error in biomass predictions. UAV image-based estimates can be made far more quickly and over extensive areas when compared to traditional data collection techniques and, with improved accuracy through further model-calibration, have the potential to be a powerful tool for mangrove biomass and carbon storage estimation.

TI  - Monoculture or Mixed Culture? Relevance of Fine Root Dynamics to Carbon Sequestration Oriented Mangrove Afforestation and Restoration
AB  - Fine root dynamics have the potential to contribute to ecosystem biogeochemical cycling, especially for carbon. This is particularly true in mangroves which are the most productive and carbon-rich ecosystems of the world. However, few studies comprehensively evaluated the contribution of mangrove fine root dynamics to soil organic carbon accumulation. In southern China, while the introduced fast-growing Sonneratia apetala and native shrubby Kandelia obovata have been widely used in mangrove reforestation/afforestation programs since the mid-1980s, their implications and ecosystem services are still unclear. Here we show distinct differences in fine root dynamic among 12-year-old S. apetala, K. obovata monocultures, and their mixed stand using root coring, ingrowth core, and intact-core methods. Soil organic carbon storage was examined by soil coring method. One-year observation showed significant differences among the three mangrove plantations in fine root biomass, necromass, turnover rate, and decomposition decay rate constant. Soil organic carbon stock was 15.8 +/- 0.8, 7.8 +/- 0.5, and 11.9 +/- 1.6 Mg C ha(-1) for K. obovata, S. apetala monocultures and their mixed stand, respectively. Live fine root biomass, fine root necromass, annual fine root production and fine root mass decay rate constant are significantly correlated to soil organic carbon content across plantations. We suggest that mangrove fine root dynamics were mainly affected by soil nutrient conditions and species composition. Mixed stands may not have higher soil organic carbon storage than monocultures. The functional trait of different mangrove species is responsible to determine the carbon storage function of mixed stands. Fine roots play an important role in carbon storage, and fine root dynamics have a significant effect on carbon sequestration in mangrove ecosystems. The shrubby native K. obovata had a higher potential for belowground carbon sequestration and storage than the tall introduced S. apetala.

TI  - Biomass and carbon stocks in mangrove stands of Kadalundi estuarine wetland, south-west coast of India
AB  - Mangroves are keystone ecosystems which provide numerous environmental services. Mangroves assume significance as standing stores of sequestered atmospheric carbon and are therefore, important in the light of climate change mitigation. In this study, we attempted to assess the biomass of mangroves in the Kadalundi wetland, south-west coast of India and evaluated the potential of these mangroves to sequester and store carbon. The C-stocks of above-ground and root biomass were 83.32 +/- 11.06 t C ha(-1) and 34.96 +/- 4.30 t C he respectively, while the C-stock in sediment was estimated to be 63.87 +/- 8.67 t C ha(-1). The estimates of mean combined C-stocks in the mangrove biomass and sediment of Kadalundi shows that this estuarine mangrove wetland stored 182.15 t C ha(-1), which was equivalent to 668.48 t CO, ha(-1). The mangroves which cover an area of 13.23 ha in the Kadalundi wetland is assumed to have a potential to sequester and store a substantial quantity of 2,409.84 t C which is equivalent to 8,844.11 t CO2. The study underscores the importance of these intertidal forests for climate change mitigation and stresses the importance of protecting the mangroves which provide many other important ecosystem services that benefit communities.

TI  - Floristic diversity, structure, and carbon stock of mangroves in a tropical lagoon ecosystem at Setiu, Malaysia
AB  - Mangroves in lagoon habitats play an important role in ecosystem functions. Many studies on mangrove habitats are available in coastal habitats However, the information on the lagoon ecosystems in tropical climates is scanty, especially regarding their vegetation and carbon storage. This study was carried out to assess the status of species diversity, composition, zonal structure, and carbon storage of mangrove vegetation in Setiu lagoon, Malaysia. We used the transect line plot method in representative landward and small fringe island areas. The results showed that the floristic diversity of mangroves comprised 18 true mangroves and 11 associates, of which Avicennia rumphiana and Ceriops decandra were listed as threatened by IUCN. The stem density and basal area ranged from 1533 to 3800 individuals. ha-1 and 18.98-37.97 m2 ha-1, respectively. The mean tree diameter was 9.80 Â± 2.85 cm, with a tree height of 10.35 Â± 2.14 m. The mangrove species with the highest importance value index (IVI) was Rhizophora mucronata with 134.86, while the lowest was Acanthus ebracteatus with 13.23. The study revealed that small fringe islands in the lagoon were more diverse, with biodiversity index values always higher than the landward zone. Total biomass from the dominant mangrove species was estimated at 522.9 t ha-1 with an estimated carbon storage of 261.45 t ha-1 and a sequestration potential of 959.54 t CO2 ha-1. Compared to the other mangrove ecosystems elsewhere, this study recommends that the Setiu lagoon should be considered as a healthy and newly generated mangrove forest. Therefore, proper monitoring is needed to ensure mangrove ecosystem health and function. Â© 2022, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

TI  - The potential contribution of the lagoon ecosystem as mangrove carbon sinks in Java
AB  - The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere continues to increase due to the increased release of CO2 in the atmosphere effect of anthropogenic activity. Mangrove ecosystems have an important role in c on tharbon sequestration and reduce the concentration of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. Mangrovee southern coast of Java partially growth in river mouth lagoon ecosystem, thus it has the potential for more vast mangrove restoration as carbon sink. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess the potential mangrove as carbon sink by the lagoon ecosystem on the Java island. One of the locations selected as an assessment sample, that is the Bogowonto Lagoon in Kulonprogo district by set up 12 plots in the planted mangrove. Allometric equation are described for assess the aboveground carbon stored in the stem and calculate the diameter at breast height (DBH) in each plot. Soil sampels were taken in each plot for assess organic carbon soil content were determined using Walkley-Black method, thus the belowground carbon sink was calculated. There was total potential mangrove carbon sink in Java which is 11,758,729.65 tons of CO2 and it can reduce carbon emissions by 4.4% in Java Island. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Heavy metal pollution correlation with mangrove (Avicennia marina) carbon sequestration in Dahisar creek of Mumbai Region, India
AB  - Heavy metal is very essential micronutrient which is required for mangrove growth but excess amount of these nutrients may adversely affect the mangrove growth and its functioning. Mangroves and their sediments act as natural sinker for heavy metals because they highly sequester such metals from tidal waters, anthropogenic pollution, mining activity and industrial waste. Dahisar creek sediment contains large quantity of heavy metals concentration due to discharge of anthropogenic pollutions. Seasonal observation shows that, heavy metal concentrations was highest in post monsoon season followed by monsoon and was lowest in the pre monsoon season. Mangrove roots act as barrier for metal translocation as well as carbon sequestration. Hence the study shows seasonal heavy metal pollution level affect the mangrove plant and its sequestration capacity. Avicennia marina, a dominant mangrove species inhabiting in Dahisar creek of Mumbai region as well as it is more sturdy species in mangrove community with respect to pollution. CHNS analyzer was used for estimation of total carbon sequestration in mangrove plant. Subsequently sediment heavy metals pollution was assessed and results are correlated with mangrove carbon sequestration, to understand its impact & severity on mangrove and its carbon sequestration capacity. Overall finding demonstrates that Dahisar creek mangrove absorbs and accumulates higher quantities of heavy metals and it is shown significant correlation with carbon sequestration capacity.

TI  - A bibliographic review of the importance of carbon dioxide capture in mangroves
AB  - The mangrove forests that exist in the world, are extremely productive ecosystems, both in the sense of biomass and carbon storage. These mangrove forests store a large amount of carbon, not only at the above ground but also below ground, being in some cases larger carbon sequestration than other similar organisms. Due to this importance, the main objective of this research, is make an exhaustive bibliographic review of the state of the art of the importance of CO2 sequestration in mangroves, in the last 10 years, to do that, key words and strategies are identified. We obtain o total of 40 articles worldwide within the 2009-2019 period. We found that 63% of these studies correspond to the mangrove forests in the Asian continent. Finally, we conclude that studies like this provide an updated bibliography of the state of the art on the carbon sequestration in mangroves to the scientific community. Â© 2019 IEEE.

TI  - Carbon sequestration potential of Rhizophora mucronata and Avicennia marina as influenced by age, season, growth and sediment characteristics in southeast coast of India
AB  - This work analysed the carbon sequestration potential in two species of mangroves (Rhizophora mucronata and Avicennia marina) along with their growth, biomass, sediment characteristics for four seasons of the year 2009-2010, in planted stands of different age (1-17.5 years) in the Vellar-Coleroon estuarine complex, India. The mangroves were recorded to store significant amount of biomass. Avicennia marina performed better to display 75 \% higher rate of carbon sequestration than that in Rhizophora mucronata. This could be attributed to growth efficiency and high biomass production. For instance, Avicennia marina exhibited 2.7 fold higher girth, 24 \% higher net canopy photosynthesis, 2 fold aboveground biomass (AGB), 40 \% more belowground biomass (BGB) and 77.3 \% higher total biomass, than R. mucronata did. Seasonally the rate of carbon sequestration was 7.3 fold higher in post-monsoon, 3.4 fold in monsoon, 73 \% more in summer than that in pre-monsoon. The rate of carbon sequestration was positively correlated with age of planted site, tree height, tree diameter, net canopy photosynthesis, AGB, BGB, total biomass, carbon stock, growth efficiency, AGB/tree height tree girth, leaf area index, silt content (p < 0.01). The carbon sequestration was negatively corrected with soil temperature and clay content (p < 0.05). Mangroves were found to be a productive system and important sink of carbon in the tropical coastal zone, but increasing soil temperature due to global warming would have a negative impact on carbon sequestration potential of the mangroves.

TI  - Measurement method of blue carbon sink and its potential assessment
AB  - Climate change is an important issue facing the world today, which restricts the sustainable development of human economy and society. As the richest and most active carbon source sink on the planet, the blue ocean plays a decisive role in the global ecosystem. This paper discusses the blue carbon measurement method and monitoring system for mangroves, tidal flat wetlands, fisheries, salt marshes and seagrass restoration from the perspective of methodology. It evaluates the blue carbon potential in China's oceans so as to promote the integration of blue carbon into climate change governance mechanisms in the direction of internationalization, standardization, and specialization. It provides reference for the implementation of blue carbon measurement standards and their methodological applications. Â© 8th International Symposium on Project Management, ISPM 2020.

TI  - Intertwined effects of climate and land use change on environmental dynamics and carbon accumulation in a mangrove-fringed coastal lagoon in Java, Indonesia
AB  - The identification and quantification of natural carbon (C) sinks is critical to global climate change mitigation efforts. Tropical coastal wetlands are considered important in this context, yet knowledge of their dynamics and quantitative data are still scarce. In order to quantify the C accumulation rate and understand how it is influenced by land use and climate change, a palaeoecological study was conducted in the mangrove-fringed Segara Anakan Lagoon (SAL) in Java, Indonesia. A sediment core was age-dated and analyzed for its pollen and spore, elemental and biogeochemical compositions. The results indicate that environmental dynamics in the SAL and its C accumulation over the past 400 years were controlled mainly by climate oscillations and anthropogenic activities. The interaction of these two factors changed the lagoon's sediment supply and salinity, which consequently altered the organic matter composition and deposition in the lagoon. Four phases with varying climates were identified. While autochthonous mangrove C was a significant contributor to carbon accumulation in SAL sediments throughout all four phases, varying admixtures of terrestrial C from the hinterland also contributed, with natural mixed forest C predominating in the early phases and agriculture soil C predominating in the later phases. In this context, climate-related precipitation changes are an overarching control, as surface water transport through rivers serves as the ``delivery agent{''} for the outcomes of the anthropogenic impact in the catchment area into the lagoon. Amongst mangrove-dominated ecosystems globally, the SAL is one of the most effective C sinks due to high mangrove carbon input in combination with a high allochthonous carbon input from anthropogenically enhanced sediment from the hinterland and increased preservation. Given the substantial C sequestration capacity of the SAL and other mangrove-fringed coastal lagoons, conservation and restoration of these ecosystems is vitally important for climate change mitigation.

TI  - Ecosystem carbon stocks of mangrove forests along the Pacific and Caribbean coasts of Honduras
AB  - Among the many ecosystem services provided by mangrove ecosystems, their role in carbon (C) sequestration and storage is quite high compared to other tropical forests. Mangrove forests occupy less than 1Â % of tropical forested areas but account for approximately 3Â % of global carbon sequestration by tropical forests. Yet there remain many areas where little data on the size and variation of mangrove C stocks exist. To address this gap and examine the range of C stocks in mangroves at landscape scales, we quantified C stocks of Honduran mangroves along the Pacific and Caribbean coasts and the Bay Islands. We also examined differences in ecosystem C stocks due to size and structure of mangrove vegetation found in Honduras. Ecosystem C stocks ranged from 570Â Mg C haâˆ’1 in the Pacific coast toÂ ~1000Â Mg C haâˆ’1 in Caribbean coast and the Bay Islands. Ecosystem C stocks on the basis of mangrove structure were 1200, 800 and 900Â Mg C haâˆ’1, in low, medium and tall mangroves, respectively. We did not find significant differences in ecosystem C stocks on the basis of location (Pacific coast, Caribbean coast and Bay Islands) or mangrove type (low, medium and tall). Mangrove soils represented the single largest pool of total C in these ecosystems, with 87, 81 and 94Â % at the Pacific coast, Caribbean coast and the Bay Islands, respectively. While there were no significant differences in total ecosystem stocks among mangrove types, there were differences in where carbon is stored. Mangrove soils among low, medium and tall mangroves contained 99, 93 and 80Â % of the total ecosystem C stocks. In addition, we found a small yet significant negative correlation between vegetation C pools and pore water salinity and pH at the sampled sites. Conversion of mangroves into other land use types such as aquaculture or agriculture could result in loses of these soil C reserves due to mineralization and oxidation. Coupled with their other ecosystem services, an understanding of the size of mangrove ecosystem C stocks underscores their values in the formulation of conservation and climate change mitigation strategies in Central America.

TI  - Sediment depth and accretion shape belowground mangrove carbon stocks across a range of climatic and geologic settings
AB  - Estimating the long-term sedimentary carbon sinks of mangroves and other blue carbon ecosystems has rapidly become a focus of coastal research and conservation attention. Sampling coverage, however, remains low, with sediment cores sparsely distributed across a subset of mangrove environmental settings globally. Furthermore, the ecological and geological drivers of variation in these stocks remain incompletely understood. We assessed the limits of mangrove sedimentary carbon storage by sampling sediments in diverse mangrove environments across four geographic areas: the volcanic Galapagos, the arid Baja Peninsula, and the geologically and climatically distinct Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Panama. At 80 sites across these areas, we quantified the organic carbon density, sampled with depth, of entire sediment columns. Depth-integrated carbon stocks are highly variable, from 1700 MgCorg ha(-1). The positive relationship between sediment carbon density and annual rainfall demonstrated in global studies was not observed across these areas, though some carbon density differences were evident. Variation in sediment depth, ranging from 7 to 427 cm across sites, largely explained variation in carbon stock across the areas studied. These results underscore the importance of using measurements of sediment depth to estimate carbon stock. Long-term geomorphological processes, such as the build-up of sediment deposits shaped by coastal dynamics, play a major role in shaping mangrove carbon stocks. Investigating and accounting for these processes will enable more accurate estimation of this variable and valuable carbon pool.

TI  - Carbon stocks in natural and planted mangrove forests of Mahanadi Mangrove Wetland, East Coast of India
AB  - Mangrove forest ecosystem is one of the important carbon sinks in the tropics. The role of mangrove forests in mitigating climate change through reduced deforestation is well recognized. The present field study aimed to estimate the carbon stocks of Mahanadi Mangrove Wetland (MMW), east coast of India. Carbon stocks were estimated in vegetation and soil of natural mangrove forest stands and new mangrove plantation stands. The mean of carbon stock in natural stands was 143.4 +/- 8.2 Mg C ha(-1) (vegetation 89.1 +/- 8.9 and soil 54.3 +/- 3.0 Mg C ha(-1)) and plantation at 151.5 +/- 7.9 Mg C ha(-1) (vegetation 90.6 +/- 16.2 and soil 60.9 +/- 5.6 Mg C ha(-1)). The mean overall C-stock of natural stands and plantations was 147.0 +/- 8.1 Mg C ha(-1) (vegetation 89.4 +/- 7.6 and soil 57.6 +/- 3.2 Mg C ha(-1)), which is 1.6 times higher than that in forests of Odisha. A positive correlation (r = 0.87) was found between vegetation biomass and soil organic carbon in the surface soil (0-30 cm), indicating the role of vegetation in building surface soil/sediment organic carbon. The 6651 ha of mangrove forests in the MMW is estimated to store 0.98 Mt of C, which is equivalent to 3.59 Mt of CO(2)e. The present study reveals that MMW stores substantial amount of atmospheric carbon and therefore needs to be conserved and sustainably managed to maintain as well as increase carbon storage. Further, mangrove plantations, on a per unit area basis, can sequester as much carbon as natural stands.

TI  - Losses of Soil Organic Carbon with Deforestation in Mangroves of Madagascar
AB  - Global mangrove deforestation has resulted in substantial CO2 emissions to the atmosphere, but the extent of emissions from soil organic carbon (C) loss remains difficult to assess. Here, we sampled five intact and five deforested mangrove plots from Tsimipaika Bay, Madagascar, to examine the loss of soil C in the 10 years since deforestation. We estimated tree biomass and analyzed grain size, Pb-210 activities, organic C and total nitrogen (N) and their stable isotopes in soils as well as dissolved organic C in surface waters. Deforested soils revealed evidence of disturbance in the upper 14 g cm(-2) (similar to 40 cm) when compared to reference intact soils, indicated by lower porosity, higher dry bulk density, an order of magnitude higher soil mixing and loss of C and N despite no significant soil erosion. Although C loss from biomass was unequivocal and was estimated at 130 Mg C ha(-1), the C loss from soils was more difficult to assess given the large heterogeneity of intact forest soils. We estimated that the loss of C due to mangrove clearing and soil exposure over 10 years was equivalent to about 20\% of the upper meter soil C stock, and about 45\% of the C stock accumulated during the last century. Soil C loss rate was 4.5 times higher than the C sequestration rate in reference intact soils. These results emphasize the importance of mangrove conservation for CO2 emissions mitigation, as they suggest that deforestation-C losses will take substantially longer to offset with mangrove restoration.

TI  - Carbon emissions as impact of mangrove degradation: A case study on the air telang protected forest, south sumatra, Indonesia (2000-2020)
AB  - Massive degradation in ATPF occurs due to anthropogenic activities that have converted this area into a coconut plantation, fishpond, settlement, and agriculture. The purpose of this study was to describe changes in land cover and the amount of CO2 emission in ATPF and its causes during the 2000-2020 period using remote sensing data. Data from remote sensing were used to obtain area, classification and land cover change in each period; meanwhile, carbon stock, emissions, and CO2 sequestration were obtained from the analysis using LUMENS software. The results showed that the emissions resulting from land conversion in ATPF during the 2000-2020 period were much greater than sequestration. Net emissions of 1,928,076.56 tons of CO2-eq with an annual emission rate of 96,403.83 tons of CO2-eq/year. The largest source of emissions came from the conversion of primary forest, coconut plantation and secondary forest to open areas; while the source of sequestration comes from the formation of primary and secondary forests. There need to be restoration and conservation efforts in this area by the government and the community to restore the function of ATPF as a coastal protection forest. This research is the first study to examine land cover changes in mangrove forests using data analysis methods with LUMENS. Â© 2021, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

TI  - Economic analysis of mangrove forest: A case of delta Kelantan mangrove forest (DKMF)
AB  - Mangrove forests are among the most productive and valuable ecosystems on earth. However, the economic value of the diverse functions they provide such as provision of fresh air, waste detoxification, climate stabilization, nursery habitats, carbon storage, recreational places, education at site and scientific research areas are not accounted for by decision-makers. This 2011-2013 study examines the total economic value (TEV) of the Delta Kelantan Mangrove Forest (DKMF) ecosystem in Peninsular Malaysia. The variables included direct use, indirect use and non-use value. Direct use values include fishery and eco-tourism. Indirect use value of the mangroves is carbon sequestration. The existence value (non-use value) represents the value of mangroves in an unharmed state. To quantify the value of the goods and services, different methods were applied. The direct uses and indirect uses were calculated using the market value of the goods and services and also non-marketed value by using stated preference approach (Contingent Valuation Method). Existence values were derived using the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM). This study showed that the net economic benefits (TEV) of DKMF were between RM 3.6 million to RM 6.1 million.

TI  - Source or sink? A study on the methane flux from mangroves stems in Zhangjiang estuary, southeast coast of China
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are an important component of â€œblue carbonâ€. However, it is not clear whether the stems play roles in the CH4 budget of mangrove ecosystems. This study investigated the CH4 emission from mangrove stems and its potential driving factors. We set up six sample plots in the Zhangjiang Estuary National Mangrove Nature Reserve, where Kandelia obovata, Avicennia marina and Aegiceras corniculata are the main mangrove tree species. Soil properties such as total carbon content, redox potential and salinity were determined in each plot. The dynamic chamber method was used to measure mangrove stems and soil CH4 fluxes. Combined field survey results with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of soil properties, we divided the six plots into two sites (S1 and S2) to perform statistical analyses of stem CH4 fluxes. Then the CH4 fluxes from mangrove tree stems and soil were further scaled up to the ecosystem level through the mapping model. Under different backgrounds of soil properties, salinity and microbial biomass carbon were the main factors modified soil CH4 fluxes in the two sites, and further affected the stem CH4 fluxes of mangroves. The soil of both sites are sources of CH4, and the soil CH4 emission of S2 was about twice higher than that of S1. Results of upscaling model showed that mangrove stems in S1 were CH4 sinks with âˆ’105.65 g dâˆ’1. But stems in S2 were CH4 sources around 1448.24 g dâˆ’1. Taken together, our results suggested that CH4 emission from mangrove soils closely depends on soils properties. And mangrove stems were found to act as both CH4 sources and CH4 sinks depend on soil CH4 production. Therefore, when calculating the CH4 budget of the mangrove ecosystem, the contribution of mangrove plant stems cannot be ignored. Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Ecosystem Carbon Stock of Selected Mangrove Forests of Vypin â€“ Cochin Region, Southwest Coast of India
AB  - In a tropical coastal environment, mangrove ecosystems store large amount of atmospheric carbon in biomass and soil. West coast of India host 29% of the mangrove ecosystems of the country. Putting aside the few scientific studies about the Indian mangroves system, there exist gaps in our scientific knowledge of Blue Carbon domain. This study aims to quantify the ecosystem carbon stocks potential and community structure of mangrove vegetation/ ecosystem species of Vypinâ€“ Cochin, a coastal region of the Southwest coast of India. The information on species-specific carbon storage will benefit to choose best species in the afforestation and conservation initiatives. Distribution, community structure and carbon pools of above and below ground biomass of the study area were assessed. From the analysis, it is evident that the amount of carbon stored in mangroves varies according to species, functional attributes (basal area, DBH, mean height etc.) and region. Avicennia officinalis, Rhizophora mucronata, Acanthus ilicifolius, Acrostichum aureum, Bruguiera cylindrica and Sonneratia caseolaris are the mangrove species observed from the study area. As per the community structure assessment, A. officinalis showed large number, frequency, density, and evenness. While considering biomass, R.mucronata species possess high value. The mean overall above ground biomass of the region was 69.55 Â± 80.38Â tÂ haâˆ’1. Ecosystem carbon stock of the area ranges from 17.7â€“138.8 with an average of 54.3 Â± 36Â tÂ haâˆ’1. Therefore, the findings described will serve as a baseline on carbon stock and mangrove stand structure of the region and their role in Blue Carbon dynamics of the Southwest Coast of India.

TI  - Variability of organic carbon matter and nitrogen deposits in a carbonate platform of mangroves
AB  - Mangroves are usually characterized by their high potential for long-term sequestration of organic carbon. Sediment accretion by these valuable habitats increased their capability of organic carbon sequestration. In this study, we aimed to examine the organic carbon sequestration of mangrove expansion (Avicennia germinans) in southern Iran. Different variables have been investigated in the sampled sediments, including delta C-13, delta N-15, TOC, TN, and C/N ratio. Our findings indicated the significant variation of measured variables in several top intervals, reflecting the existence of autochthonous and allochthonous organic substances. Our data showed that the minority of delta C-13 values are lower than -23\% in the S3 site, suggesting that mangrove litter is a critical input OC (delta C-13, -28 to -30\%). On the other hand, the significantly higher value of delta C-13 (-14 to -23\%) indicates that phytoplankton and possibly local microphytobenthos are the primary sources of organic materials inputs. Moreover, site S4 presents the highest mean value of C/N, TN, and delta N-15, which can be justified because of its proximity to the estuary and supply of organic matters imported from algal sources. The substantial role of mangrove forests depositing organic carbon should be investigated in the global carbon cycle.

TI  - Control of â€œblue carbonâ€ storage by mangrove ageing: Evidence from a 66-year chronosequence in French Guiana
AB  - The role of mangroves in the blue carbon stock is critical and requires special focus. Mangroves are carbon-rich forests that are not in steady-state equilibrium at the decadal time scale. Over the last decades, the structure and zonation of mangroves have been largely disturbed by coastal changes and land use conversions. The amount of time since the last disturbance is a key parameter determining forest structure, but it has so far been overlooked in mangrove carbon stock projections. In particular, the carbon sequestration rates among mangrove successional ages after (re)establishment are poorly quantified and not used in large-scale estimations of the blue carbon stock. Here, it is hypothesized that ecosystem age structure significantly modulates mangrove carbon stocks. We analysed a 66-year chronosequence of the aboveground and belowground biomass and soil carbon stock of mangroves in French Guiana, and we found that in the year after forest establishment on newly formed mud banks, the aboveground, belowground and soil carbon stocks averaged 23.56Â Â±Â 7.71, 13.04Â Â±Â 3.37 and 84.26Â Â±Â 64.14 (to a depth of 1Â m) Mg C/ha, respectively. The mean annual increment (MAI) in the aboveground and belowground reservoirs was 23.56Â Ã—Â Ageâˆ’0.52 and 13.20Â Ã—Â Ageâˆ’0.64Â Mg CÂ haâˆ’1Â yearâˆ’1, respectively, and the MAI in the soil carbon reservoir was 3.00Â Â±Â 1.80Â Mg CÂ haâˆ’1Â yearâˆ’1. Our results show that the plant carbon sink capacity declines with ecosystem age, while the soil carbon sequestration rate remains constant over many years. We suggest that global projections of the above- and belowground reservoirs of the carbon stock need to account for mangrove age structures, which result from historical changes in coastal morphology. Our work anticipates joint international efforts to globally quantify the multidecadal mangrove carbon balance based on the combined use of age-based parametric equations and time series of mangrove age maps at regional scales.

TI  - The present state-of-the-art of blue carbon repository in India: a meta-analysis
AB  - The present study collated data on the Indian blue carbon repository (mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes) from peer-reviewed literature on carbon stock assessment. This meta-analysis indicated that the blue carbon ecosystems of India could have a collective carbon stock of 67.35 Tg C (mangroves, seagrass, and salt marsh accounting for 67 Tg C, 0.0630 Tg C, and 0.0049 Tg C, respectively). Several studies have ubiquitously measured the spatial extent of mangroves (~ 4991 km2) and seagrasses (~ 517 km2) in India; however, the salt marshes (290â€“1398 km2) have contradictions in estimates. The green payments against the blue carbon ecosystems of India can be as high as ~ 9.6 billion US $, whereas the social cost of carbon sequestered by these ecosystems can vary between 0.47 and 5.43 billion US $. The present study also identified the key research areas that require priority to minimize the uncertainties in blue carbon stock assessment to foster a robust ecosystem-based approach for climate change adaptation in the country. The study identified that less than half of the total mangrove habitats of India are yet to be sampled leaving a scope of substantial uncertainty in nationwide blue carbon estimates. The spatial extent of Indiaâ€™s salt marshes is another aspect that needs to be delineated with a higher confidence level.

TI  - Aboveground Carbon Stocks in Rapidly Expanding Mangroves in New Zealand: Regional Assessment and Economic Valuation of Blue Carbon
AB  - Blue carbon is increasingly being considered in global carbon budgets; however, there is poor understanding of how carbon stocks vary within mangrove forests with heterogeneous growth forms and in areas where mangroves are showing rapid changes in distribution. Here, field measurements and LiDAR data were used to estimate aboveground carbon stocks and economic benefits of Avicennia marina in the Auckland Region, New Zealand, where the mangrove area has increased at an annual rate of 3.2\% since 1940. Multiple allometric equations were explored to determine best fits for different growth forms (tall and dwarf mangroves) that minimised uncertainty in conversions of tree size to aboveground carbon stock estimates. Across the Auckland Region, the mean total aboveground carbon stock (including trees, seedling, pneumatophores and woody debris) was 40.2 Mg C ha(-1) with over 75\% contained in tree biomass. Total aboveground carbon stocks varied considerably between mangrove growth form (tall and dwarf mangroves) and hydrodynamic conditions (estuarine, riverine and delta mangroves). Total aboveground carbon storage across the Auckland Region amounted to 384,451 Mg C with an economic value of US\$ 70 million. This study demonstrates that LiDAR data can be used to produce reliable and high-resolution tree carbon stock estimates in estuaries characterised by spatially variable distributions of dwarf mangroves. These estimates are critical for the incorporation of mangroves into national blue carbon accounting schemes.

TI  - Carbon Sink Potential of Avicennia marina in the Al-Qurm Nature Reserve, Muscat, Oman
AB  - Climate change is a global issue, caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere resulting in many adverse effects. One of the many responses to the climate change impact is to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Al-Qurm Nature Reserve in Muscat city of Oman is a mangrove vegetation protected by law as conservation area. Carbon sequestration was estimated in three distinct zones of this natural mangrove vegetation with Avicennia marina. The mean carbon stock in the middle zone was 7.7 +/- 0.3 kg C/m(2), and for the seaward zone was 5.3 +/- 0.7 kg C/m(2), and for landward 18.8 +/- 0.1 kg C/m(2), which is 3.5 times higher than seaward zone and slightly more than 2 times than middle zone. The 0.82 km(2) of Al-Qurm Nature Reserve occupied purely by Avicennia marina was estimated to sink about 8692 t C (0.0087 Mt C) equivalent to about 0.032 Mt of CO2e. These estimates suggest a high carbon storage and carbon sequestration potential of Avicennia marina in Al-Qurm Nature Reserve despite their relatively small area.

TI  - Methane emissions partially offset â€œblue carbonâ€ burial in mangroves
AB  - Organic matter burial in mangrove forests results in the removal and long-term storage of atmospheric CO2, so-called â€œblue carbon.â€ However, some of this organic matter is metabolized and returned to the atmosphere as CH4. Because CH4 has a higher global warming potential than the CO2 fixed in the organic matter, it can offset the CO2 removed via carbon burial. We provide the first estimate of the global magnitude of this offset. Our results show that high CH4 evasion rates have the potential to partially offset blue carbon burial rates in mangrove sediments on average by 20% (sensitivity analysis offset range, 18 to 22%) using the 20-year global warming potential. Hence, mangrove sediment and water CH4 emissions should be accounted for in future blue carbon assessments. Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors.

TI  - Fluxes of dissolved methane and nitrous oxide in the tidal cycle in a mangrove in South China
AB  - Mangroves are carbon sinks that are believed to contribute to carbon neutrality; however, they are also considered to be partly offset by their emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). In this study, dissolved CH4, N2O and other hydrological parameters over the tidal cycle in the Golden Bay mangrove (GBM), Beihai, Guangxi, are investigated during the dry season and wet season. The concentration and flux of dissolved N2O and CH4 in the GBM have distinct seasonal variations under the influence of the tidal cycle, and the concentration and flux in the dry season were higher than those in the wet season, with GBM as a weak source of N2O and a strong source of CH4. The fluxes of N2O and CH4 were 119 +/- 370 mu mol m(-2) yr(-1) and 87.2 +/- 48.6 mmol m(-2) yr(-1) respectively during tidal coverage. The emission of CH4 through the water-atmosphere interface offsets 22.5 \% of the total carbon sequestration of GBM. Owing to the potential increase in N2O emissions caused by possible exogenous nitrogen input and the transport of dissolved CH4 from mangroves to coastal water, uncertainty remains in assessing the capacity of blue carbon sinks in mangroves.

TI  - Carbon stock assessment of mangrove ecosystem in totok bay, southeast minahasa regency, north sulawesi, indonesia
AB  - This study aims to analyze the blue carbon potential of mangrove ecosystem in Totok Bay waters, Southeast Minahasa Regency, North Sulawesi, using line transect method with 10 x 10 m2 quadrat placed seaward perpendicular to the shore. Preliminary survey observation found 3 species of mangrove, Rhizophora mucronata, Avicennia alba and Bruguiera gymnorhiza. Vegetation analysis was to determine the role of mangrove species using Important Value Index (IVI). IVI obtained was 147.47% for R. mucronata, 60.99% for A. alba, and 91.53% for B. gymnorhiza, respectively. Biomass measurements provided information on carbon stock. Data obtained was analyzed using allometric equation. Results showed that mean carbon stock of the mangrove biomass in Totok Bay was 17.1 kg MgC ha-1. Physical and chemical parameters analyses were also conducted as supporting data of carbon stock. Mean total carbon sink in mangrove sediment was 286.18 Mg ha-1. Mean blue carbon potential absorption was 193. 28 ton C ha-1. This research showed that mangrove ecosystem in Totok Bay held sufficiently high carbon stock. Nevertheless, the future study needs to be directed to carbon stock comparison with other locations in North Sulawesi. Â© 2018, BIOFLUX SRL. All rights reserved.

TI  - Estimation of Mangrove Blue Carbon in Three Semi-arid Lagoons in the Gulf of California
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems are recognized as natural climate solutions due to their capacity to store carbon (C) in the vegetation and soil. Thus, the extent of such role by mangrove ecosystems has raised interest in the scientific community. Mangrove carbon stock above ground biomass is higher in humid tropical areas than in dry subtropical ones. However, a lack of information persists when it comes to the belowground C. This research aimed to determine the carbon stock in relation to total mangrove biomass in three semi-arid coastal lagoons in the Gulf of California, Mexico. Different methods were used, tree structure and pneumatophore measurements, litter traps, root and production cores; along with measurements of physicochemical parameters in sediment in surface and interstitial water. Mean carbon in the total mangrove biomass was 54.1 MgCorgÂ·haâˆ’1, with a maximum of 102.1 Â± 14.2 MgCorgÂ·haâˆ’1 at the Lobos site. In arid areas, mangroves are characterized by larger amounts of belowground biomass associated with environmental factors such as pH, redox potential, and temperature, leading to a high Corg content belowground. Root production are high, enhancing the efficiency of belowground Corg storage related to the life cycle of roots (turnover). The presence of Conocarpus erectus (L), a new record of the distribution limit of the species in the Gulf of California (Lobos), attained the highest values of structural development, litter-based primary productivity, and belowground root production and biomass. Therefore, this species is recommended for restoration (reforestation), given its high primary productivity that stabilizes the coastline and increases carbon storage dynamics.

TI  - Alkalinity Production Coupled to Pyrite Formation Represents an Unaccounted Blue Carbon Sink
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems, including mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses, mitigate climate change by storing atmospheric carbon. Previous blue carbon research has focused on organic carbon stocks. However, recent studies suggest that lateral inorganic carbon export might be equally important. Lateral export is a long-term carbon sink if carbon is exported as alkalinity (TAlk) produced via sulfate reduction coupled to pyrite formation. This study evaluates drivers of pyrite formation in blue carbon ecosystems, compares pyrite production to TAlk outwelling rates, and estimates global pyrite stocks in mangroves. We quantified pyrite stocks in mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses along a latitudinal gradient on the Australian East Coast, including a mangrove dieback area, and in the Everglades (Florida, USA). Our results indicate that pyrite stocks were driven by a combination of biomass, tidal amplitude, sediment organic carbon, sediment accumulation rates, rainfall, latitude, temperature, and iron availability. Pyrite stocks were three-times higher in mangroves (103Â Â±Â 61Â Mg/ha) than in saltmarshes (30Â Â±Â 30Â Mg/ha) and seagrasses (32Â Â±Â 1Â Mg/ha). Mangrove pyrite stocks were linearly correlated to TAlk export at sites where sulfate reduction was the dominant TAlk producing process. However, pyrite generation could not explain all TAlk outwelling. We present the first global model estimating pyrite stocks in mangroves, giving a first-order estimate of 197Â Mg/ha (RMSEÂ =Â 24Â Mg/ha). In mangroves, estimated global TAlk production coupled to pyrite formation (âˆ¼3Â mol/m2/y) is equal to âˆ¼24% of their global carbon burial rate, highlighting the importance of including TAlk export in future blue carbon budgets.

TI  - Estimation of total fine root production using continuous inflow methods in tropical mangrove forest on Pohnpei Island, Micronesia: Fine root necromass accumulation is a substantial contributor to blue carbon stocks
AB  - Fine root decomposition, mortality, and production are fundamental components of belowground carbon dynamics in mangrove ecosystems. Mangroves are highly productive ecosystems with huge carbon stocks; however, information on the dynamics of submerged fine roots in mangrove soils is limited. To estimate fine root production in several sites of mangrove communities on Pohnpei Island, Micronesia, we estimated continuous inflows using a simple mass balance model to combine ingrowth core and litterbag experimental results. According to our findings, previously reported mangrove fine root production values were severely underestimated because the fine root decomposition process was disregarded during the experimental period. We estimated that annual fine root production up to 0.3 m in depth ranged from 13.8 (Bruguiera gymnorrhiza in a landward plot) to 56.3 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) (B. gymnorrhiza in a seaward plot). However, comparing the fine root production with respect to the unit of stem cross-section area increase in the sample tree, the fine root production of Rhizophora spp. was greater than that of other species. The annual fine root mortality and decomposition to annual fine root production was 70\%-105\% and 11\%-52\% of annual production, respectively. The annual fine root production estimated here was much higher than that previously reported. These findings begin to quantify the contribution and importance of highly productive mangrove fine roots for carbon sequestration in blue carbon ecosystems. Moreover, this study provides new insights into the organic carbon dynamics in mangrove soils with mangrove vegetation succession.

TI  - Mangrove structure and its influence on the carbon storage in La Encrucijada Reserve, Chiapas, Mexico [Estructura del manglar y su influencia en el almacÃ©n de carbono en la reserva la encrucijada, Chiapas, MÃ©xico]
AB  - Mangroves have been considered as an important carbon storage, and in general, exceeding the carbon content of terrestrial forests. Even when mangrove aerial carbon sequestration has been studied in several regions of Mexico, the information at the Pacific coast is lacking. The aim of this work was to characterize the structure of riverine mangroves in order to determine height, coverage, DBH and to estimate the complexity and importance value indexes, as well to relate it with the carbon storage, in 32 circular sampling units (400 m2) at La Encrucijada Reserve, Chiapas. The carbon content was quantified according allometric equations for Neotropical mangrove species, with high structural development and we used a biomass to carbon conversion factor of 0.48. The influence of the interstitial sediment parameters (pH, salinity, temperature) on the stored carbon was determined using an analysis of variance and covariance. Mangrove density was 2103 ind ha-1, the tree mean height was 12 m; basal area, 18.7 m2 ha-1; coverage, 9.9 m2 and DAP, 8.4 cm. A complexity index of 40.1 was recorded; the order of importance of the species was Rhizophora mangle / Avicennia germinans / Laguncularia racemosa. The carbon store was 87.0 Mg ha-1. Structural parameters showed a high correlation (R = 1.00, 0.94 and 0.84) with the mangrove biomass. In function of this structure, this ecosystem was classified as a successional stage of intermediate community with a high structural complexity. Â© 2019, Instituto de Ecologia, A.C..

TI  - Does food partitioning vary in leaf-eating crabs in response to source quality?
AB  - Mangroves have a relevant ecosystem function due to their efficiency in blue carbon sequestration. Autotrophic carbon conservation in mangroves remains controversial. In this sense, autotrophic nutrient assimilation by crabs can highlight their ecosystem function. This study aims to identify the relationship between quality sources and food partitioning in two leaf-eating crabs, Ucides cordatus and Goniopsis cruentata. Quantification of the litterfall biomass, analysis of the soil, the C/N ratio and stable isotopes (Î´ 13 C and Î´ 15 N) were used to evaluate food sources and crab tissues in two mangrove forests. The litterfall and soil C contents and C/N ratios of the Pacoti River (PR) were higher than those of the Jaguaribe River. The higher C/N ratios of the litterfall of the PR led to higher nitrogen ingestion from complementary food sources (soil and omnivorous invertebrates). The nutritional requirements and food partitioning behavior of both species emphasize the ecosystem functions of leaf-eating crabs concerning the assimilation and conservation of autotrophic carbon and nitrogen in mangroves.

TI  - Impacts of aquaculture on the area and soil carbon stocks of mangrove: A machine learning study in China
AB  - Mangrove is an important carbon sink, as it can achieve climate regulation by sequestering carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. However, 50 % of mangrove species are threatened with extinction in China, and the carbon stocks in vegetation has also dropped by 53.1 %. Here, we couple remote sensing data with Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and XGBoost to analyse mangroves in mainland China from 1986 to 2019. We find that aquaculture has crucial impacts on mangroves and prediction error. Future predictions indicate that the changes of mangroves in different cities range from âˆ’5.09E+06 m2 to 2.30E+06 m2, and soil carbon(C) stocks is â€œ-1.90E+05 Mg ~ 8.57E+04 Mgâ€. To protect mangroves, exploring the balance between aquaculture and mangroves and paying attention to the sustainable transformation of aquaculture are urgently required. In this way, mangroves can fully play the role of carbon sequestration and contribute to China's dual carbon goals. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Sediment carbon sequestration and sources in peri-urban tidal flats and adjacent wetlands in a megacity
AB  - We investigated the sediment carbon (C) stocks, sequestration and sources in tidal flats and their adjacent mangroves in two coastal wetlands in Hong Kong (the Mai Po Nature Reserve (MPNR) and Ting Kok (TK)), part of a megacity of âˆ¼20 million. At both locations, the C stock of tidal flats was lower than that of mangroves. In MPNR, tidal flats indicated a higher C burial rate (75.2 g C mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1) compared to mangroves (64.3 g C mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1). The C of tidal flats mainly originated from mangroves and riverine sources, while those in deeper sediments (below 60 cm) in the mangroves originated from the tidal flats. In TK, the C of tidal flats was dominated by oceanic sources. Our study indicates that tidal flats are also important in coastal C sequestration. On highly urbanized coasts, tidal flats and their connected mangroves can play a critical role for C mitigation. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Rapid losses of surface elevation following tree girdling and cutting in tropical mangroves
AB  - The importance of mangrove forests in carbon sequestration and coastal protection has been widely acknowledged. Large-scale damage of these forests, caused by hurricanes or clear felling, can enhance vulnerability to erosion, subsidence and rapid carbon losses. However, it is unclear how small-scale logging might impact on mangrove functions and services. We experimentally investigated the impact of small-scale tree removal on surface elevation and carbon dynamics in a mangrove forest at Gazi bay, Kenya. The trees in five plots of a Rhizophora mucronata (Lam.) forest were first girdled and then cut. Another set of five plots at the same site served as controls. Treatment induced significant, rapid subsidence (2 32.1Â±8.4 mm yr-1 compared with surface elevation changes of +4.2Â±1.4 mm yr-1 in controls). Subsidence in treated plots was likely due to collapse and decomposition of dying roots and sediment compaction as evidenced from increased sediment bulk density. Sediment effluxes of CO2 and CH4 increased significantly, especially their heterotrophic component, suggesting enhanced organic matter decomposition. Estimates of total excess fluxes from treated compared with control plots were 25.3Â±7.4 tCO2 ha-1yr-1(using surface carbon efflux) and 35.6Â±76.9 tCO2 ha-1yr-1(using surface elevation losses and sediment properties). Whilst such losses might not be permanent (provided cut areas recover), observed rapid subsidence and enhanced decomposition of soil sediment organic matter caused by small-scale harvesting offers important lessons for mangrove management. In particular mangrove managers need to carefully consider the trade-offs between extracting mangrove wood and losing other mangrove services, particularly shoreline stabilization, coastal protection and carbon storage.

TI  - Water pollution association with Mangrove carbon sequestration in Mithi river
AB  - Mangrove ecosystem is strongly bound to the coastal environment which survives and flourishes in good quality of water and within its tolerance level. This ecosystem is very sensitive to water pollution and it has direct relationship with mangrove functioning. Minor changes in water quality can cause noticeable mortality and severe damage of mangroves ecosystem. However its mortality is the best indicator of global warming, climate change and severity of water pollution. The pilot study was conducted in Mithi river mangrove site which is constantly facing small industrial effluent, domestic sewage and solid waste which is major cause of pollution. As a result study site water quality is intensely polluted and it is seriously affecting mangrove growth and its sequestration capacity. Avicennia marina is one of the most dominant mangrove species in study site therefore it was selected for the assessment. Consequently CHNS instrument was used for estimation of total carbon. Pearson correlation matrix were use to understand water pollution impact and severity on mangrove sequestration. This study reveals that Mithiriver is highly polluted and this pollution definitely affects mangrove growth, quality and functioning. Â© 2018 EM International. All rights reserved.

TI  - The economic feasibility of Blue Carbon cooperation in the South China Sea region
AB  - Coastal Blue Carbon is the carbon stored in mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass meadows. There is an urgent need to protect the coastal ecosystem by developing Blue Carbon economy. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility and mechanism of the Blue Carbon cooperation in the South China Sea Region (SCSR) from an economic angle. We utilize the paradigm of Cobb-Douglas production to stimulate Blue Carbon development and mathematically prove the feasibility of such a cooperation strategy. The Shapley value in game theory is further applied, which not only confirms the reality of this cooperation but also provides an allocation mechanism of the cooperation benefits. The results suggest that there exists a profitable opportunity for the Blue Carbon cooperation in the SCSR. Further discussion and suggestions are provided in promotion of research focus on the Blue Carbon cooperation. Â© 2019

TI  - Ecosystem carbon losses following a climate-induced mangrove mortality in Brazil
AB  - Drought events may induce mangrove mortality and dieback events worldwide as a result of climate extremes. As mangroves sequester large quantities of carbon, quantifying the losses of these stocks following climate disturbances may guide wetland governance strategies globally. In Southeast Brazil, we determined the total ecosystem carbon stocks (TECS) of pristine mangroves that were up to 1851 Mg of carbon per hectare (Mg C haâˆ’1), which are the highest stocks measured from South American and raising estimates of Brazil's mangrove TECS to 0.52 Pg C. A mangrove mortality event in the same estuary resulted in a 14.6 % decrease in TECS (270.5 Mg C haâˆ’1) and loss of 20 % of mangrove soil carbon within less than 2-years. Carbon dioxide emissions from this impact were 992.8 Mg CO2e haâˆ’1, which are slightly lower than emissions from land use disturbances on mangroves worldwide. Our results suggest that climate effects on mangroves can become significant sources of greenhouse gases globally. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Global Significance of Mangrove Blue Carbon in Climate Change Mitigation
AB  - Mangrove forests store and sequester large area-specific quantities of blue carbon (Corg). Except for tundra and peatlands, mangroves store more Corg per unit area than any other ecosystem. Mean mangrove Corg stock is 738.9 Mg Corg haâˆ’1 and mean global stock is 6.17 Pg Corg, which equates to only 0.4â€“7% of terrestrial ecosystem Corg stocks but 17% of total tropical marine Corg stocks. Per unit area, mangroves sequester 179.6 g Corg mâˆ’2Â·aâˆ’1 and globally about 15 Tg Corg aâˆ’1. Mangroves sequester only 4% (range 1.3â€“8%) of Corg sequestered by terrestrial ecosystems, indicating that mangroves are a minor contributor to global C storage and sequestration. CO2 emissions from mangrove losses equate to 0.036 Pg CO2-equivalents aâˆ’1 based on rates of C sequestration but 0.088 Pg CO2-equivalents aâˆ’1 based on complete destruction for conversion to aquaculture and agriculture. Mangrove CO2 emissions account for only 0.2% of total global CO2 emissions but 18% of CO2 emissions from the tropical coastal ocean. Despite significant data limitations, the role of mangrove ecosystems in climate change mitigation is small at the global scale but more significant in the tropical coastal ocean and effective at the national and regional scale, especially in areas with high rates of deforestation and destruction.

TI  - Vascular Plants Are Globally Significant Contributors to Marine Carbon Fluxes and Sinks
AB  - More than two-thirds of global biomass consists of vascular plants. A portion of the detritus they generate is carried into the oceans from land and highly productive blue carbon ecosystems-salt marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows. This large detrital input receives scant attention in current models of the global carbon cycle, though for blue carbon ecosystems, increasingly well-constrained estimates of biomass, productivity, and carbon fluxes, reviewed in this article, are now available. We show that the fate of this detritus differs markedly from that of strictly marine origin, because the former contains lignocellulose-an energy-rich polymer complex of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin that is resistant to enzymatic breakdown. This complex can be depolymerized for nutritional purposes by specialized marine prokaryotes, fungi, protists, and invertebrates using enzymes such as glycoside hydrolases and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases to release sugar monomers. The lignin component, however, is less readily depolymerized, and detritus therefore becomes lignin enriched, particularly in anoxic sediments, and forms a major carbon sink in blue carbon ecosystems. Eventual lignin breakdown releases a wide variety of small molecules that may contribute significantly to the oceanic pool of recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon. Marine carbon fluxes and sinks dependent on lignocellulosic detritus are important ecosystem services that are vulnerable to human interventions. These services must be considered when protecting blue carbon ecosystems and planning initiatives aimed at mitigating anthropogenic carbon emissions. Â© 2020 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.

TI  - Prokaryotic Diversity in Mangrove Sediments across Southeastern China Fundamentally Differs from That in Other Biomes
AB  - Mangroves, as a blue carbon reservoir, provide an environment for a variety of microorganisms. Mangroves lie in special locations connecting coastal and estuarine areas and experience fluctuating conditions, which are expected to intensify with climate change, creating a need to better understand the relative roles of stochastic and deterministic processes in shaping microbial community assembly. Here, a study of microbial communities inhabiting mangrove sediments across southeastern China, spanning mangroves in six nature reserves, was conducted. We performed high-throughput DNA sequencing of these samples and compared them with data of 1,370 sediment samples collected from the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) to compare the microbial diversity of mangroves with that of other biomes. Our results showed that prokaryotic alpha diversity in mangroves was significantly higher than that in other biomes and that microbial beta diversity generally clustered according to biome types. The core operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in mangroves were mostly assigned to Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Euryarchaeota. The majority of beta nearesttaxon index values were higher than 2, indicating that community assembly in mangroves was better explained through a deterministic process than through a stochastic process. Mean annual precipitation (MAP) and total organic carbon (TOC) were main deterministic factors explaining variation in the microbial community. This study fills a gap in addressing the unique microbial diversity of mangrove ecosystems and their microbial community assembly mechanisms. IMPORTANCE Understanding the underlying mechanisms of microbial community assembly patterns is a vital issue in microbial ecology. Mangroves, as an important and special ecosystem, provide a unique environment for examining the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic processes. We made the first global-scale comparison and found that microbial diversity was significantly different in mangrove sediments compared to that of other biomes. Furthermore, our results suggest that a deterministic process is more important in shaping microbial community assembly in mangroves.

TI  - Carbon Stock Assessment of a Mangrove Ecosystem in San Juan, Batangas
AB  - In the context of climate change and global warming, carbon sequestration receives a considerable attention now. In the latest assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global mean temperature has dramatically increased over the past decades. There is also mounting evidence that this increase will remain as problems on landuse change and industrial emissions continue to worsen. Among the GHGs, CO2 is the most abundant. Forest ecosystems such as mangroves play a significant role in the climate change problem because they serve as sinks of atmospheric. Great attention is focused on tropical forests to offset carbon emissions. Thus, this study was intended to assess the carbon storage potential of a mangrove forest in San Juan Batangas. A nested plot method developed by ICRAF-ASB Program and allometric equations developed by Komiyama et. al. (2005) were employed to estimate the above-ground biomass and carbon density of the two stands: Rhizophora-dominated stand in Barangay Poctol; and Avicennia-dominated stand in Barangay Catmon. Both Rhizophora and Avicennia dominated stand exhibited good carbon storage potential hence proper forest management is essential to sustain and improve its capacity to help mitigate climate change.

TI  - Mangrove blue carbon stocks and dynamics are controlled by hydrogeomorphic settings and land-use change
AB  - Globally, carbon-rich mangrove forests are deforested and degraded due to land-use and land-cover change (LULCC). The impact of mangrove deforestation on carbon emissions has been reported on a global scale; however, uncertainty remains at subnational scales due to geographical variability and field data limitations. We present an assessment of blue carbon storage at five mangrove sites across West Papua Province, Indonesia, a region that supports 10\% of the world's mangrove area. The sites are representative of contrasting hydrogeomorphic settings and also capture change over a 25-years LULCC chronosequence. Field-based assessments were conducted across 255 plots covering undisturbed and LULCC-affected mangroves (0-, 5-, 10-, 15- and 25-year-old post-harvest or regenerating forests as well as 15-year-old aquaculture ponds). Undisturbed mangroves stored total ecosystem carbon stocks of 182-2,730 (mean +/- SD: 1,087 +/- 584) Mg C/ha, with the large variation driven by hydrogeomorphic settings. The highest carbon stocks were found in estuarine interior (EI) mangroves, followed by open coast interior, open coast fringe and EI forests. Forest harvesting did not significantly affect soil carbon stocks, despite an elevated dead wood density relative to undisturbed forests, but it did remove nearly all live biomass. Aquaculture conversion removed 60\% of soil carbon stock and 85\% of live biomass carbon stock, relative to reference sites. By contrast, mangroves left to regenerate for more than 25 years reached the same level of biomass carbon compared to undisturbed forests, with annual biomass accumulation rates of 3.6 +/- 1.1 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). This study shows that hydrogeomorphic setting controls natural dynamics of mangrove blue carbon stocks, while long-term land-use changes affect carbon loss and gain to a substantial degree. Therefore, current land-based climate policies must incorporate landscape and land-use characteristics, and their related carbon management consequences, for more effective emissions reduction targets and restoration outcomes.

TI  - New insight into global blue carbon estimation under human activity in land-sea interaction area: A case study of China
AB  - The C sequestration in coastal blue carbon (C-b) ecosystems, including mangroves, seagrasses and saltmarshes, was discovered to be useful in mitigating the increasing trend of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission due to climate change. In this study, we systematically estimate traditional C-b ecosystem distribution and the associated C-b sequestration rate, and then further quantify the C-b sinks fishery contribution to C-b ecosystem due to human activity in coastal ecosystem. The results show that the global C-b ecosystem is able to store 10.8 PgC, wherein biomass and soil are able to store 2.13 and 8.68 PgC, respectively. In China, the C-b pools are 162 TgC in mangroves, 67 TgC in saltmarshes and 75 TgC in seagrass. The human activity induced global C-b sink fishery on C-b ecosystem is about 26.58-37.6 TgC yr(-1), accounting for 30.7\%-43.4\% of the world's traditional C-b sequestration ecosystem. The global C-b sequestration potential reaches up to 86.59 Tg yr(-1), while China can explain 1.70\% of the world's total C-b sequestration. However, in China, the C-b sequestration due to human activity reaches up to 632-7.89 TgC yr(-1), accounting for 20.9\%-23.7\% of global C-b sink fishery. Therefore, it is very important to build the C-b sink fisheries measure and monitor system to scientifically valuate C-b sink fisheries and associated development potential. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Comparison of fine root biomass and soil organic carbon stock between exotic and native mangrove
AB  - The fast growing exotic Sonneratia apetala has been widely used to increase the mangrove area in China. Despite of the rapidly accumulated biomass, S. apetala does not increase the soil organic carbon (SOC) storage comparing with native mangroves. The belowground biomass of mangrove, especially its fine roots, plays an important role in SOC sequestration. Here, the soil physicochemical properties, vegetation and fine-root biomass and SOC stock were compared between S. apetala (22-year-old) plantation and native mangrove at different stages (20, 40, and 80-year-old) The 22-year-old S. apetala already had a higher vegetation biomass and fine root biomass than the 20-year-old and 40-year-old native mangrove. However, no significant differences in the SOC stock were observed between S. apetala and native mangrove (20-year-old and 40-year-old). The biomass of vegetation and fine root and SOC stock of S. apetala were all significantly lower than that of 80-year-old Rhizophora stylosa. Multiple stepwise regression analysis suggested that lower C:N ratio of fine roots and soil salinity in S. apetala can promote the decomposition rate of fine roots and then offset the carbon accumulation advantage related to higher fine root biomass. Restoration of mangrove was effective to enhance soil carbon stock, but the exotic S. apetala should be decreased or avoided in the future, especially in the Natural Reserve.

TI  - Community structure and carbon sequestration potential of mangroves in Maasim, Sarangani Province, Philippines
AB  - The capacity of mangrove forests to act both as a source and sink of carbon makes them key ecosystems on the mitigation strategies against climate change. We evaluated the community structure and carbon sequestration potential of mangroves in Maasim, Sarangani Province using distribution and diversity indices and allometric equations. A total of 1129 mangrove individuals growing in different habits were inventoried. Five species were identified, namely: Sonneratia alba, Rhizophora mucronata, Rhizophora apiculata, Avicennia marina, and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza. R. mucronata was the most dense (RD = 76.88%) and most frequent (RF = 44.53%) species in the area, but S. alba dominated (RO = 91.36%) in terms of basal area and was also the most important species (IV = 49.08%). The forest has low to moderate diversity (H' = 0.715) and evenness (E = 0.444) with only two equally abundant species (ENS = 2.044). In terms of aboveground carbon density, S. alba was significantly greater in amount (446.275 Mg C ha-1) compared to the other species. Zone-wise, seaward stored most of the carbon mass amounting to 241.527 Mg C ha-1. Overall, the total aboveground carbon stock in the mangrove forest was 15.130 Gg, which is equivalent to 55.526 Gt of CO2. In conclusion, S. alba showed high potential of sequestering atmospheric carbon among the mangrove species identified. Meanwhile, the high forest aboveground carbon density implies high carbon sequestration activity. However, this could also mean huge amounts of carbon to be released back to the atmosphere if the forest is disturbed by human activities.

TI  - Assessing the spatiotemporal changes, associated carbon stock, and potential emissions of mangroves in Bahrain using GIS and remote sensing data
AB  - The gray mangrove (Avicennia marina (Forssk) Vierh) constructs one of Bahrain's most critical ecosystem, severly deteriorating, which has been severely deteriorated by increasing anthropogenic pressures. This study aimed to assess the spatiotemporal changes in the mangrove habitat around Tubli Bay, Kingdom of Bahrain, over the last 50 years through achieving the following: (1) detect the progressive reduction in the mangrove cover using Geographic Information Science and Systems (GISs) techniques and remote sensing data, (2) estimate the changes of above-below ground (AGB-BGB) carbon sequestered in the mangroves using a GIS-based spatial analysis approach, and (3) estimate the potential carbon emission changes from the loss of original mangrove habitats. Various GIS and remotely sensed data were employed in the study, including high-resolution satellite images from Worldview-3, Worldview-2, IKONOS, and QuickBird, coupled with true-color orthorectified aerial photographs. Additional data was acquired from fieldwork and the ancillary GIS maps. Image processing of the satellite data was conducted using ENVI 5.5 Software. ArcGIS 10.8 was used for digitizing the mangrove areas in all satellite imagery. The final maps were used to calculate mangrove area changes and carbon loss due to land reclamation activities. Our results indicated that Bahrain lost more than 95\% of the natural mangrove cover from 1967 to 2020. The mangrove extent area's net loss reached 280 ha during 1967-2020, as it declined from 328 ha in 1967 to 48 ha in 2020. The primary cause of the decline was land reclamation associated with urban development. The rates and causes of the loss varied both spatially and temporally. Due to land clearing, the total carbon stored in the mangrove habitats declined from 34,932.2 Mg C ha(-1) in 1967 to 5112 Mg C ha(-1) in 2020. Consequently, the potential carbon Sequestration decreased from 128,200.44 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1) in 1967 to 18,761.04 Mg CO2e ha(-1) in 2020. Our study urges for more efficient conservation of the remaining mangroves in Bahrain to sustain their valuable ecosystem services particularly carbon sequestration. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Variability in blue carbon storage related to biogeochemical factors in seagrass meadows off the coast of the Korean peninsula
AB  - Coastal vegetated habitats such as mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses, referred to as blue carbon ecosystems, play an important role in climate change mitigation by an effective CO2 capture from atmosphere and water columns and long-term organic carbon (Corg) storage in sediments. Although seagrass meadows are considered intense carbon sinks, information on regional variability in seagrass blue carbon stock and factors influencing its capacity still remain sparse. In the present study, seagrass blue carbon storage by measuring Corg stocks in sediments and living seagrass biomass, and carbon accumulation rates (CARs) in seagrass meadows were estimated along the Korean coast. Factors affecting variability in Corg stocks were also analyzed using partial least squares (PLS) regression and principal component analysis (PCA). Projected Corg stocks in sediment, extrapolated to a depth 1 m, exhibited substantial variability among sites, ranging from 49.91 to 125.71 Mg C haâˆ’1. The majority of Corg (96â€“99%) was stored in sediments, whereas the contribution of living biomass was minor. PLS regression and PCA indicated that Corg stocks in seagrass meadows are strongly associated with sediment characteristics such as dry bulk density and water and mud content. Among seagrass traits, above- to below-ground biomass ratio was significantly related to the quantity of Corg stocks in seagrass meadows. Because of the high spatial variability in Corg stocks and CARs, local and regional differences in seagrass blue carbon storage should be considered to accurately assess the climate change mitigation potential of seagrass ecosystems.

TI  - Carbon Stock Analysis of Mangrove Ecosystems in Paliat Island Sumenep East Java
AB  - Mangroves have important roles in the coastal environment. They enrich coastal waters with nutrient, protect coastlines from abrasion and sea level rise as well as support coastal fisheries. Another function of mangroves that are less known is their role in carbon (C) sequestration and storage. Previous studies reveal that mangrove forests contain some of the highest carbon stocks per unit area compared to other forest types. However, that information is not widely available, particularly in Indonesia. This study aimed to determine distribution and community structure of mangroves ecosystem and to estimate carbon stock stored in the mangrove forest of Paliat Island Sumenep East Java. The data collection was conducted on the island, starting from July to September 2017 using harvesting sampling method. Furthermore, to discriminate carbon stock from different parts of mangrove vegetation, One Way ANOVA statistical analysis was employed. The results showed that there were 4 dominant mangrove species on the island namely Rhizophora mucronata, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Rhizophora stylosa and Rhizophora apiculata. The total mangrove biomass of the study area was approximately 21.59 ton/Ha with an estimated carbon stock around 10.80 ton/Ha. Further analysis explained that there was a significant difference in carbon stock between various parts of mangrove vegetation (One Way ANOVA, F = 220, df1=4, df2=85, p&lt;0.05).

TI  - Carbon Stocks Assessment in a Disturbed and Undisturbed Mangrove Forest in Ghana
AB  - Mangroves and other blue carbon ecosystems have long been recognised for their carbon sink function, yet the organic carbon stocks of mangroves in many countries in Africa remain to be assessed. This study evaluates the impact of traditional forest conservation on long-term carbon sequestration in a non-degraded (Amanzule) and a degraded (Kakum) mangrove forest system in Ghana (West Africa). The amount of carbon stored in mangrove trees was estimated from diameter-based allometric equations. Tree (above- and below-ground) carbon was similar to 34-fold higher in the Amanzule forest (mean = 0.89 +/- 0.10 t/ha) than in the Kakum forest (mean = 0.026 +/- 0.019 t/ha). Soil carbon density was estimated as organic carbon and bulk density at specific depths in both forests. Soil organic carbon density was similar to 5-fold higher in the Amanzule forest (mean = 2935.79 +/- 266 t/ha) than the Kakum forest (mean = 554.01 +/- 83 t/ha). The variation in the vertical distribution of soil carbon was not significant in either forest (F = 0.57; p > 0.05). These findings underscore the role of traditional conservation on mangrove carbon stocks and the need to consider the governance of coastal ecosystems when estimating blue carbon.

TI  - Diversity of mangrove vegetation and carbon sink estimation of segara anakan mangrove forest, Cilacap, central Java, Indonesia
AB  - Mangrove forests are known as standing stores of sequestered atmospheric carbon. The role of mangrove forests in the sequestering substantial amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and storing the carbon in its biomass has been recently underscored. This research aimed to estimate vegetation diversity and carbon sink potential of Segara Anakan Mangrove Forest Cilacap, Central Java from August-December 2012. Vegetations sampling was done by square plots technique. Diversity index was utilized to determine species diversity. Allometric equations were used to estimate biomass and carbon sinks. This study only calculates aboveground biomass and carbon sinks. The research results showed that mangrove in Segara Anakan was composed of 24 species with 19 families, consisting of 16 species of trees, 14 species of saplings and 16 species of herbs. The most dominant tree was Avicennia marina with importance value of 43.62% in Kembang Kuning, 60.27% in Ujung Alang and 25.6% in Klaces. The most dominant of sapling was Avicennia marina, with an important value of 31.1%. The total biomass of a tree is about 43.06 kg/tree or 0.13 ton/ha. Total biomass of sapling was 27.38 kg/tree or 0.32 ton/ha. The carbon sink of the tree was 49.10 ton/ha and carbon sink of sapling was 79.39 ton/ha. It can be concluded that Segara Anakan Mangrove forest is very important as a carbon sink in South part of Central Java, Indonesia. Â© 2017, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ecosystem carbon stocks across a tropical intertidal habitat mosaic of mangrove forest, seagrass meadow, mudflat and sandbar
AB  - Intertidal habitats provide numerous ecosystem services, including the sequestration and storage of carbon, a topic of great recent interest owing to land-cover transitions and climate change. Mangrove forests and seagrass meadows form a continuum of intertidal habitats, alongside unvegetated mudflats and sandbars, however, studies that consider carbon stocks across these spatially-linked, threatened ecosystems are limited world-wide. This paper presents the results of a field-based carbon stock assessment of aboveground, belowground and sediment organic carbon stock to a depth of 1m at Chek Jawa, Singapore. It is the first study of ecosystem carbon stocks of both vegetated and unvegetated intertidal habitats in the tropics. Ecosystem carbon stocks were 497Mg C ha(-1) in the mangrove forest and 138Mg C ha(-1) in the seagrass meadow. Sediment organic carbon stock dominated the total storage in both habitats, constituting 62\% and >99\% in the mangrove forest and seagrass meadow, respectively. In the adjacent mudflat and sandbars, which had no vegetative components, sediment organic carbon stock ranged from 124-143Mg C ha(-1), suggesting that unvegetated habitats have a carbon storage role on the same order of importance as seagrass meadows. This study reinforces the importance of sediment in carbon storage within the intertidal ecosystem, and demonstrates the need to consider unvegetated habitats in intertidal blue carbon' stock assessments.

TI  - Distribution Pattern and Influencing Factors for Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) in Mangrove Communities at Dongzhaigang, China
AB  - Mangrove wetlands constitute an important carbon pool and play an important role in the global carbon balance. Understanding the distribution and influencing factors for soil organic carbon (SOC) in different mangrove communities can improve the estimation of carbon sink capacity. The SOC content and physicochemical properties were investigated from six mangrove communities dominated by Avicennia marina, Aegiceras corniculatum, Bruguiera sexangula, Sonneratia apetala, Rhizophora stylosa, or Ceriops tagal in Dongzhaigang, Southern China. The SOC content ranged from 2.60 to 89.51 g kg(-1) with a mean of 18.35 g kg(-1). The SOC content and density decreased with the depth from surface to bottom and with the tidal gradient from the low intertidal zone to the high intertidal zone except for the SOC density in the soils of the three arbor communities (S. apetala, R. stylosa, and B. sexangula). The SOC content was more related to soil nutrient elements such as total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total potassium than to pH, bulk density, conductivity, and other soil environmental factors. Among these six mangrove plants, R. stylosa and A. corniculatum should be highly prioritized during mangrove restoration for the higher soil carbon sequestration rate and the stronger adaptive capacity.

TI  - The Science and Policy of the Verified Carbon Standard Methodology for Tidal Wetland and Seagrass Restoration
AB  - The restoration of tidal wetland and seagrass systems has the potential for significant greenhouse gas benefits, but project-level accounting procedures have not been available at an international scale. In this paper, we describe the Verified Carbon Standard Methodology for Tidal Wetland and Seagrass Restoration, which provides greenhouse gas accounting procedures for marsh, mangrove, tidal forested wetland, and seagrasses systems across a diversity of geomorphic conditions and restoration techniques. We discuss and critique the essential science and policy elements of the methodology and underlying knowledge gaps. We developed a method for estimating mineral-protected (recalcitrant) allochthonous carbon in tidal wetland systems using field-collected soils data and literature-derived default values of the recalcitrant carbon that accompanies mineral deposition. We provided default values for methane emissions from polyhaline soils but did not provide default values for freshwater, oligohaline, and mesohaline soils due to high variability of emissions in these systems. Additional topics covered are soil carbon sequestration default values, soil carbon fate following erosion, avoided losses in organic and mineral soils, nitrous oxide emissions, soil profile sampling methods, sample size, prescribed fire, additionality, and leakage. Knowledge gaps that limit the application of the methodology include the estimation of CH4 emissions from fresh and brackish tidal wetlands, lack of validation of our approach for the estimation of recalcitrant allochthonous carbon, understanding of carbon oxidation rates following drainage of mineral tidal wetland soils, estimation of the effects of prescribed fire on soil carbon stocks, and the analysis of additionality for projects outside of the USA.

TI  - Mangroves as a Source of Greenhouse Gases to the Atmosphere and Alkalinity and Dissolved Carbon to the Coastal Ocean: A Case Study From the Everglades National Park, Florida
AB  - Most research evaluating the potential of mangroves as a sink for atmospheric carbon has focused on carbon burial in sediments. However, the few studies that have quantified lateral exchange of carbon and alkalinity indicate that the dissolved carbon and alkalinity export may be several-fold more important than burial. This study aims to investigate rates and drivers of alkalinity, dissolved carbon, and greenhouse gas fluxes of the mangrove-dominated Shark River estuary located in the Everglades National Park in Florida, USA. Spatial surveys and 29-hr time series were conducted to assess total alkalinity (TAlk), organic alkalinity (OAlk), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) dynamics. Dissolved carbon and greenhouse gas concentrations were coupled to porewater input, which was examined using radon-222. Shark River was a source of CO2 (92 mmol/m(2)/day), CH4 (56 mu mol/m(2)/day), and N2O (2 mu mol/m(2)/day) to the atmosphere. Dissolved carbon export (DIC = 142 mmol/m(2)/day, DOC = 39 mmol/m(2)/day, normalized to mangrove area) was several-fold higher than previously reported carbon burial rates in the study area (similar to 28 mmol/m(2)/day). The majority of the DIC was exported as TAlk (97 mmol/m(2)/day), which remains dissolved in the ocean for millennia and, therefore, represents a long-term sink for atmospheric carbon. By integrating our results with previous studies, we argue that alkalinity, dissolved carbon, and greenhouse gas fluxes should be considered in future blue carbon budgets. Plain Language Summary Protecting mangroves can help us deal with one of the biggest challenges of our time: Climate change. Mangroves remove carbon dioxide - the gas that is making the world hotter - from the air around us and store it in their surrounding soils. Many scientists have studied how much carbon is trapped in mangrove soils, and the newest studies say that some of that trapped carbon is flushed out to the coastal ocean. We wanted to find out for ourselves so we went to Everglades National Park, which protects the biggest mangrove forest in North America. We cruised along the Shark River estuary and spent day and night on the boat to uncover this carbon mystery. We found that the estuary loses greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere, but much less compared to what it loses to the Gulf of Mexico. We could also confirm that the amount of carbon lost was much greater than what is trapped in soils. We encourage other researchers to investigate dissolved carbon export in other mangroves in order to find out how much mangroves can alleviate the impacts of climate change.

TI  - Seventy years of continuous encroachment substantially increases ``blue carbon' capacity as mangroves replace intertidal salt marshes
AB  - Shifts in ecosystem structure have been observed over recent decades as woody plants encroach upon grasslands and wetlands globally. The migration of mangrove forests into salt marsh ecosystems is one such shift which could have important implications for global blue carbon' stocks. To date, attempts to quantify changes in ecosystem function are essentially constrained to climate-mediated pulses (30years or less) of encroachment occurring at the thermal limits of mangroves. In this study, we track the continuous, lateral encroachment of mangroves into two south-eastern Australian salt marshes over a period of 70years and quantify corresponding changes in biomass and belowground C stores. Substantial increases in biomass and belowground C stores have resulted as mangroves replaced salt marsh at both marine and estuarine sites. After 30years, aboveground biomass was significantly higher than salt marsh, with biomass continuing to increase with mangrove age. Biomass increased at the mesohaline river site by 130 +/- 18Mg biomass km(-2)yr(-1) (mean +/- SE), a 2.5 times higher rate than the marine embayment site (52 +/- 10Mg biomass km(-2) yr(-1)), suggesting local constraints on biomass production. At both sites, and across all vegetation categories, belowground C considerably outweighed aboveground biomass stocks, with belowground C stocks increasing at up to 230 +/- 62MgCkm(-2) yr(-1) (+/- SE) as mangrove forests developed. Over the past 70years, we estimate mangrove encroachment may have already enhanced intertidal biomass by up to 283097Mg and belowground C stocks by over 500000Mg in the state of New South Wales alone. Under changing climatic conditions and rising sea levels, global blue carbon storage may be enhanced as mangrove encroachment becomes more widespread, thereby countering global warming.

TI  - Extraction of seagrass biophysical parameters using unmanned aerial systems (UAS)
AB  - Carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere is drastically increasing every year because of continuous development of industrial activities of today's society. An active research regarding carbon sequestration and carbon storage is progressing, demanding for more investigation and analysis of carbon sinks. Recent studies found out that coastal wetlands - mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrass, are far more capable of carbon sequestration and carbon storage than terrestrial ecosystems. Approximately 15% of total carbon storage in the ocean are sequestered by seagrasses, although seagrasses inhabit only 0.2% of the area of the oceans. To estimate the carbon sequestered by seagrasses, extent, percent cover and density are among the biophysical parameters necessary. In this study, the RGB aerial images using Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) was utilized for classification of seagrass and extraction of seagrass density and percent cover. UAS survey was conducted in Anda, Pangasinan to gather RGB images and field samples were also collected. The images were mosaicked to produce an orthophoto. To classify seagrass from non-seagrass areas, object-based classification (OBC) and pixel-based classification (PBC) were used and compared by implementing the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Maximum Likelihood method. Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering was performed for the derivation of the percent cover and density. Results showed that OBC having an overall accuracy of 93% produced higher accuracy than PBC which yields 86%. Meanwhile, most seagrass areas were categorized with dense and continuous density. The study proved that Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) was an effective approach for seagrass cover mapping because it produces high-resolution images resulting to more accurate maps.

TI  - Effects of oyster aquaculture on carbon capture and removal in a tropical mangrove lagoon in southwestern Taiwan
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs) are a promising resource for the mitigation of global warming; however, climate spectrums and anthropogenic activities could influence the fragile balance of BCEs as carbon sinks or sources. We assess how oyster farming affects dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA) on CO2 fluxes in a mangrove-dominated lagoon. Water physical, chemical and biological parameters were recorded by in-situ buoys within the lagoon and at its inflow. Structural equation modeling was adopted to clarify the factors/processes controlling the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2). A three-dimensional environmental model followed by a conceptual DIC model was used to quantify the spatiotemporal patterns of capture and release of DIC and TA by oyster production. The results showed that 49% of TA and DIC released from mangroves was depleted by oyster shell formation. DIC was reduced by algal photosynthesis and algal was served as a food source supporting oyster production. Annual oyster production through phytoplankton photosynthesis accounted for 11% of the atmosphere carbon inflows, suggesting that oyster production served as a significant atmospheric/terrestrial carbon sink in the lagoon. The results indicate that mangroves benefit local oyster production by acting as an important source of DIC and TA, and that the oyster aquaculture contributed to carbon capture in a mangrove-dominated lagoon ecosystem.

TI  - Australian vegetated coastal ecosystems as global hotspots for climate change mitigation
AB  - Policies aiming to preserve vegetated coastal ecosystems (VCE; tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrasses) to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions require national assessments of blue carbon resources. Here, we present organic carbon (C) storage in VCE across Australian climate regions and estimate potential annual CO2 emission benefits of VCE conservation and restoration. Australia contributes 5-11\% of the C stored in VCE globally (70-185 Tg C in aboveground biomass, and 1,055-1,540 Tg C in the upper 1 m of soils). Potential CO2 emissions from current VCE losses are estimated at 2.1-3.1 Tg CO2-e yr(-1), increasing annual CO2 emissions from land use change in Australia by 12-21\%. This assessment, the most comprehensive for any nation to-date, demonstrates the potential of conservation and restoration of VCE to underpin national policy development for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Carbon Removal Using Coastal Blue Carbon Ecosystems Is Uncertain and Unreliable, With Questionable Climatic Cost-Effectiveness
AB  - Mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and tidal saltmarshes are vegetated coastal ecosystems that accumulate and store large quantities of carbon in their sediments. Many recent studies and reviews have favorably identified the potential for such coastal â€œblue carbonâ€ ecosystems to provide a natural climate solution in two ways: by conservation, reducing the greenhouse gas emissions arising from the loss and degradation of such habitats, and by restoration, to increase carbon dioxide drawdown and its long-term storage. The focus here is on the latter, assessing the feasibility of achieving quantified and secure carbon removal (negative emissions) through the restoration of coastal vegetation. Seven issues that affect the reliability of carbon accounting for this approach are considered: high variability in carbon burial rates; errors in determining carbon burial rates; lateral carbon transport; fluxes of methane and nitrous oxide; carbonate formation and dissolution; vulnerability to future climate change; and vulnerability to non-climatic factors. Information on restoration costs is also reviewed, with the conclusion that costs are highly uncertain, with lower-range estimates unrealistic for wider application. CO2 removal using coastal blue carbon restoration therefore has questionable cost-effectiveness when considered only as a climate mitigation action, either for carbon-offsetting or for inclusion in Nationally Determined Contributions. Many important issues relating to the measurement of carbon fluxes and storage have yet to be resolved, affecting certification and resulting in potential over-crediting. The restoration of coastal blue carbon ecosystems is nevertheless highly advantageous for climate adaptation, coastal protection, food provision and biodiversity conservation. Such action can therefore be societally justified in very many circumstances, based on the multiple benefits that such habitats provide at the local scale. Copyright Â© 2022 Williamson and Gattuso.

TI  - Global hotspots of salt marsh change and carbon emissions
AB  - Salt marshes provide ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration1, coastal protection2, sea-level-rise (SLR) adaptation3 and recreation4. SLR5, storm events6, drainage7 and mangrove encroachment8 are known drivers of salt marsh loss. However, the global magnitude and location of changes in salt marsh extent remains uncertain. Here we conduct a global and systematic change analysis of Landsat satellite imagery from the years 2000â€“2019 to quantify the loss, gain and recovery of salt marsh ecosystems and then estimate the impact of these changes on blue carbon stocks. We show a net salt marsh loss globally, equivalent to an area double the size of Singapore (719 km2), with a loss rate of 0.28% yearâˆ’1 from 2000 to 2019. Net global losses resulted in 16.3 (0.4â€“33.2, 90% confidence interval) Tg CO2e yearâˆ’1 emissions from 2000 to 2019 and a 0.045 (âˆ’0.14â€“0.115) Tg CO2e yearâˆ’1 reduction of carbon burial. Russia and the USA accounted for 64% of salt marsh losses, driven by hurricanes and coastal erosion. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of salt marsh systems to climatic changes such as SLR and intensification of storms and cyclones. Â© 2022, The Author(s).

TI  - Carbon cycling and storage in mangrove forests
AB  - Mangroves are ecologically and economically important forests of the tropics. They are highly productive ecosystems with rates of primary production equal to those of tropical humid evergreen forests and coral reefs. Although mangroves occupy only 0.5 of the global coastal area, they contribute 10-15 (24 Tg C y-1) to coastal sediment carbon storage and export 10-11 of the particulate terrestrial carbon to the ocean. Their disproportionate contribution to carbon sequestration is now perceived as a means for conservation and restoration and a way to help ameliorate greenhouse gas emissions. Of immediate concern are potential carbon losses to deforestation (90-970 Tg C y -1) that are greater than these ecosystems' rates of carbon storage. Large reservoirs of dissolved inorganic carbon in deep soils, pumped via subsurface pathways to adjacent waterways, are a large loss of carbon, at a potential rate up to 40 of annual primary production. Patterns of carbon allocation and rates of carbon flux in mangrove forests are nearly identical to those of other tropical forests. Copyright Â© 2014 by Annual Reviews.

TI  - Mangrove root biomass and the uncertainty of belowground carbon estimations
AB  - Mangroves sequester large amounts of carbon (C) and they are increasingly recognized for their potential role in climate change mitigation programs. However, there is uncertainty in the C content of many mangrove forests because the amount of C stored in the roots is usually estimated from allometric equations and not from direct field measurements. There are only a handful of allometric equations in mangroves that are used worldwide to estimate root biomass, however, root biomass can vary from the allometric relationship if the environmental conditions are different from those where the equation was developed. In this study, we compiled recent information on how mangrove roots are affected by environmental conditions. Then, we explored the effect of sampling methodology on root biomass estimations. Finally, we compared published values of root biomass from field measurements against our estimations from allometric equations. The goal was to calculate the uncertainty associated with the estimation of root biomass and thus, the belowground C content of mangroves. The results showed that sampling methodology has a significant effect on root biomass estimations. The highest biomass estimations are reported where both live and dead roots are measured and when the roots are sampled by digging trenches. When comparing measured values against estimations from allometric equations, on average the general allometric equation provided root biomass values that were 40 Â± 12% larger than those obtained from field measurements with cores. The result suggests that either: (a) sampling with cores largely underestimates root biomass, or (b) allometric equations overestimate root biomass when used outside the region where they were developed. The uncertainty in root biomass estimates from allometric equations corresponds to 4â€“15% of the ecosystem C stock (trees + soil), with higher uncertainties in forests with low tree density and low interstitial salinity. We provide a statistical model that includes salinity, forest density and root biomass to correct for this systematic bias. The estimated uncertainty is important to consider when quantifying C budgets at large spatial scales and to validate methodological approaches to C stock estimations. Â© 2017

TI  - Root biomass and production of mangroves surrounding a karstic oligotrophic coastal lagoon
AB  - Root production influences a range of belowground processes, such as soil accretion, carbon sequestration and nutrient acquisition. Here, we measured biomass and root production of mangroves surrounding a karstic oligotrophic lagoon that spans a nutrient and salinity gradient. We also measured forest structure and soil physicochemical conditions (salinity, bulk density, carbon, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)) in order to determine factors associated with root production. We tested the following hypotheses: 1) root biomass and production increase at low soil P and N in order to maximize resource utilization, and 2) root biomass and production increase with high interstitial salinity. Root biomass (947- 3,040 g m-2) and production (0.46-1.85 g m-2 day-1) increased where soil P and interstitial salinity were relatively high. Thus, we rejected the first hypothesis and confirmed the second. The larger root fraction (5-20 mm) was the major contributor to root biomass and production. Our findings suggest that root production and thus capacity for belowground carbon storage in karstic regions, where P is often limiting, is greater where interstitial salinity and P are higher. This contrasts with past assessments indicating that Pdeficiency stimulates root growth, suggesting wide variation in belowground responses in mangroves. Â© Society of Wetland Scientists 2014.

Water and soil parameters were sampled and analyzed for 10 selected stations along with aboveground biomass (AGB) and aboveground C (AGC) values. AGB value in the study area ranged from 15.00 Â± 2.12 to 70.09 Â± 6.68 thaâˆ’1 for A. marina, 26.13 Â± 3.19 thaâˆ’1 to 616.94 Â± 50.15 thaâˆ’1 for A. officinalis, 3.56 Â± 0.96 thaâˆ’1 to 98.66 Â± 5.24 thaâˆ’1 for E. agallocha, 7.06 Â± 2.21 thaâˆ’1 to 224.41 Â± 21.20 thaâˆ’1 for R. mucronata, and 0.64 Â± 0.21 thaâˆ’1 to 6.25 Â± 1.52 thaâˆ’1 for X. granatum, respectively.

The average SOC values in thaâˆ’1 varied from 3.52 Â± 0.12 to 7.71 Â± 0.45. The total carbon (AGC + SOC) calculated for the study area varied from 55.20 Â± 7.90 to 330.41 Â± 111.97 thaâˆ’1 with a mean total carbon of 124.11 Â± 30.14 which is equivalent to 455.47 Â± 110.56 tons of CO2.

TI  - Water-air gas exchange of CO2 and CH4 in coastal wetlands
AB  - This chapter discusses carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) gas exchange at the water-air interface in coastal wetlands. The existing literature was reviewed to report the magnitude of CO2 and CH4 water-air fluxes in mangrove, saltmarsh, and seagrass ecosystems. Based on available data, mangrove waters show a large range of CO2 (13â€“9726mgCO2mâˆ’2 dayâˆ’1) and CH4 water-air fluxes (âˆ’1.1â€“1169mgCH4 mâˆ’2 dayâˆ’1) and are generally a source of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere. Similarly, saltmarsh waters are predominantly water-air sources of CO2 (mean: 2823Â±332mgCO2 mâˆ’2 dayâˆ’1) and CH4 (âˆ’1.5â€“1510mgCH4 mâˆ’2 dayâˆ’1). In contrast, seagrass waters can act as a source or sink of CO2 (âˆ’3168â€“3041mgCO2 mâˆ’2 dayâˆ’1) and are likely a source of CH4 to the atmosphere (1.9â€“4.9mgCH4 mâˆ’2 dayâˆ’1). High spatial and temporal variability and the large range of fluxes are linked to tidal regimes, seasonality, vegetation coverage, and complex biogeochemical processes that occur in coastal wetland sediments and waters. Various direct and indirect drivers are described that can control CO2 and CH4 concentration gradients, transport pathways, and fluxes from sediments to the water column and ultimately to the atmosphere. Finally, the three most commonly used methods to determine water-air gas exchange in coastal waters are reviewed, which are the chamber method, the gradient flux method, and the eddy-covariance technique. Using appropriate methods, more research is needed for a better assessment of long-term and large-scale gas exchange in dynamic coastal wetland waters, to quantify more accurately present and to predict future greenhouse gas trends and potential â€œblue carbonâ€ offsets in mangrove, saltmarsh, and seagrasses on regional and global scale.

TI  - Valuing the contribution of blue carbon to small island developing states' climate change commitments and Covid-19 recovery
AB  - Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face complex socio-economic and environmental threats, making them particularly vulnerable to climate change. Blue Carbon (BC) ecosystems (mangrove forests, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows) provide climate regulation services by sequestering and storing carbon, presenting an opportunity for SIDS to address climate change and implement Paris Agreement commitments in their Covid-19 recovery. BC habitat decline not only reduces carbon sequestration benefits provided, but can also result in sediment disturbance and the release of previously stored carbon back into the atmosphere. In this work, a scenario analysis informed by a stakeholder workshop and scientific and socio-economic expectations is used to assess the economic importance of Grenada's BC (mangroves and seagrasses) over the next 10, 25 and 50 years. Our findings indicate that sequestration benefits are severely diminished under Business-as-Usual habitat loss, but still marginally outweigh losses from carbon emissions, with overall welfare gains of US$0.5â€“1.9 million over 50 years. To stimulate economic recovery post-pandemic, stakeholders anticipated a realistic scenario of increased habitat decline resulting in overall losses of US$5.4â€“19.4 million in the next 50 years. However, if ecosystems are maintained, overall carbon benefits could reach US$10.7 million, while a 20% increase in mangroves over the next 25 years provides benefits reaching US$11.1 million between 2020 and 2070. These results demonstrate a significant increase in value when BC ecosystems are maintained and not disturbed, preventing the release of previously stored carbon and enhancing sequestration capacity. Restoration benefits are marginal, compared to conservation, supporting claims that conservation is more cost effective. Â© 2022

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Trends in Biomass and Carbon Sequestration Potential of Sonneratia apetala Buch.-Ham in Indian Sundarbans
AB  - The authors estimated the above ground biomass (AGB) of Sonneratia apetala Buch.-Ham in western and central Indian Sundarbans for five successive years (2005-2010) and analysed the change of carbon stock through time. The biomass and carbon content of the species varied significantly with age and site (p < 0.01). This variation may be attributed to drastically different environmental conditions prevailing in the selected sectors of Indian Sundarbans. The western sector is relatively less saline and favourable for the growth of the mangrove species. The central sector is hypersaline on account of massive siltation that prevents the mixing of fresh water of the river Ganga with the river Matla. The growth and carbon content in the AGB of the species is significantly lower in this environment.

TI  - Organic carbon stabilization mechanisms in mangrove soils: A review
AB  - Despite the recognized organic carbon (OC) sequestration potential of mangrove forests, the ongoing climate change and anthropogenic disturbances pose a great threat to these ecosystems. However, we currently lack the ability to mechanically understand and predict the consequences of such impacts, primarily because mechanisms underlying OC stabilization in these ecosystems remain elusive. Research into OC stabilization has focused on terrestrial soils and marine sediments for decades, overlooking the vegetated coastal ecosystems including mangroves. In terrestrial soils and marine sediments, it is widely accepted that OC stabilization is the integrated consequence of OM's inherent recalcitrance, physical protection, and interactions with minerals and metals. However, related discussion is rarely done in mangrove soils, and recalcitrance of roots and high net ecosystem production (high primary production and low heterotrophic respiration) have been considered as a primary OC sequestration mechanism in mangrove peat and mineral soils, respectively. This review presents the available information on the mechanisms underlying OC stabilization in mangrove soils and highlights research questions that warrant further investigation. Primary OC stabilization mechanisms differ between mangrove peat and mineral soils. In mangrove mineral soils, physico-chemical stabilization processes are important, yet grossly understudied OC stabilization mechanisms. In mangrove peat, recalcitrance of mangrove roots and the inhibition of phenoloxidase under the anoxic condition may be the primary OC stabilization mechanisms. Salinity-induced OC immobilization likely plays a role in both type of soils. Finally, this review argues that belowground production and allochthonous inputs in mangrove forests are likely underestimated. More studies are needed to constrain C budgets to explain the enigma that mangrove OC keeps accumulating despite much higher decomposition (especially by large lateral exports) than previously considered.

TI  - Effect of the conversion of mangroves into shrimp farms on carbon stock in the sediment along the southern Red Sea coast, Saudi Arabia
AB  - The conservation of coastal ecosystems and specially mangroves â€˜â€˜blue carbonâ€™â€™ is receiving more attention as consequence of their recognition as high ecosystem carbon stocks and for the fact that these areas are undergoing land conversion. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the impact of land use changes due to conversion of mangroves to shrimp farms on the bulk density (SBD), organic carbon (SOC) concentration, and SOC stock in the sediments along the southern Saudi Arabian Red Sea coast. Shrimp farms and mangrove locations showed significant (P &lt; 0.001) differences in SBD with high mean values in the sediments of shrimp farms. Shrimp farms and mangrove locations showed significant (P &lt; 0.001) SOC concentration differences with high mean values in the sediments of mangroves. Considering the whole depth of sediment interval (0-100 cm), the highest value of SOC stock was recorded at mangroves (29.2 kg C mâˆ’2) and the lowest was identified at the locations of shrimp farms (19.9 kg C mâˆ’2). The results show that SOC stock of mangroves is 147% higher than that of shrimp farms confirming the fact that anthropogenic factors contributed significantly to SOC stock decrease. The mean cumulative potential carbon dioxide (CO2) emission due to loss soil carbon stock from mangrove conversion to the shrimp ponds was 34.9 kg CO2 mâˆ’2. In conclusion, the conversion of mangroves into shrimp farms contributed to the loss of SOC stock, therefore, the preservation of mangrove areas has an important value especially in arid areas such as Saudi Arabia.

TI  - Establishing rates of carbon sequestration in mangroves from an earthquake uplift event
AB  - We assessed the carbon stocks (CS) in mangroves that developed after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in Silonay, Oriental Mindoro, south Luzon, The Philippines in November 1994. The earthquake resulted in a 50 cm uplift of sediment that provided new habitat within the upper intertidal zone which mangroves colonized (from less than 2 ha pre-earthquake to the current 45 ha, 23 years post-earthquake). The site provided an opportunity for a novel assessment of the rate of carbon sequestration in recently established mangroves. The carbon stock was measured in above-ground, below-ground and sediment compartments over a seaward to landward transect. Results showed a mean carbon stock of 549 +/- 30 Mg C ha(-1) (of which 13\% was from the above-ground biomass, 5\% from the below-ground biomass and 82\% from the sediments). There was high carbon sequestration at a 40 cm depth that can be inferred attributable to the developed mangroves. The calculated rate of C sequestration (over 23 years post-earthquake) was 10.2 +/- 0.7 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) and is comparable to rates reported from mangroves recovering from forest clearing. The rates we present here from newly developed mangroves contributes to calibrating estimates of total CS from restored mangroves (of different developmental stages) and in mangroves that are affected by disturbances.

TI  - The blue carbon wealth of nations
AB  - Carbon sequestration and storage in mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass meadows is an essential coastal `blue carbon' ecosystem service for climate change mitigation. Here we offer a comprehensive, global and spatially explicit economic assessment of carbon sequestration and storage in three coastal ecosystem types at the global and national levels. We propose a new approach based on the country-specific social cost of carbon that allows us to calculate each country's contribution to, and redistribution of, global blue carbon wealth. Globally, coastal ecosystems contribute a mean +/- s.e.m. of US\$190.67 +/- 30 bn yr(-1) to blue carbon wealth. The three countries generating the largest positive net blue wealth contribution for other countries are Australia, Indonesia and Cuba, with Australia alone generating a positive net benefit of US\$22.8 +/- 3.8 bn yr(-)(1) for the rest of the world through coastal ecosystem carbon sequestration and storage in its territory. Blue carbon ecosystems take up and store substantial amounts of carbon. This represents an important ecosystem service in the context of climate change, with coastal ecosystems contributing nearly US\$200 bn yr(-)(1) to blue carbon wealth.

TI  - Predators help protect carbon stocks in blue carbon ecosystems
AB  - Predators continue to be harvested unsustainably throughout most of the Earth's ecosystems. Recent research demonstrates that the functional loss of predators could have far-reaching consequences on carbon cycling and, by implication, our ability to ameliorate climate change impacts. Yet the influence of predators on carbon accumulation and preservation in vegetated coastal habitats (that is, salt marshes, seagrass meadows and mangroves) is poorly understood, despite these being some of the Earth's most vulnerable and carbon-rich ecosystems. Here we discuss potential pathways by which trophic downgrading affects carbon capture, accumulation and preservation in vegetated coastal habitats. We identify an urgent need for further research on the influence of predators on carbon cycling in vegetated coastal habitats, and ultimately the role that these systems play in climate change mitigation. There is, however, sufficient evidence to suggest that intact predator populations are critical to maintaining or growing reserves of `blue carbon' (carbon stored in coastal or marine ecosystems), and policy and management need to be improved to reflect these realities.

TI  - Blue carbon effects of mangrove restoration in subtropics where Spartina alterniflora invaded
AB  - Mangrove swamps and salt marshes are noted for their large carbon sequestration and storage capacity. In southeastern China, mangrove transplantation is conducted as ecological restoration where exotic Spartina alterniflora (hereafter Spartina) is removed. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of mangrove trans-plantation on carbon sink potential. We analyzed chronological sediment accretion, soil carbon sequestration, and carbon storage of mangroves and Spartina on Maoyan and Ximen islands. Results showed that on both islands mangroves and invasive Spartina stored 12.7\%-31.4\% more carbon than bare mudflats over top meter soils, with Spartina outperforming restored mangroves. Both restored mangroves and invasive Spartina enhanced sediment accretion, but this enhancement was minimal in high sediment supply areas like Maoyan. Spartina invasion improved carbon sequestration capacity compared to bare mudflats in Maoyan, but mangrove restoration failed. In low sediment supply areas like Ximen, restored mangroves have outperformed Spartina invasion on carbon sequestration enhancement since >5 years of planting. Thus, carbon sink potential of mangrove restoration depended on sediment supply and time, with sediment supply being more important. We suggested that it was preferable to conduct mangrove restoration with Spartina eradication in low sediment supply areas in subtropics.

TI  - Drivers and modelling of blue carbon stock variability in sediments of southeastern Australia
AB  - Tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows are important global carbon (C) sinks, commonly referred to as coastal ``blue carbon{''}. However, these ecosystems are rapidly declining with little understanding of what drives the magnitude and variability of C associated with them, making strategic and effective management of blue C stocks challenging. In this study, our aims were threefold: (1) identify ecological, geomorphological, and anthropogenic variables associated with 30 cm deep sediment C stock variability in blue C ecosystems in southeastern Australia, (2) create a predictive model of 30 cm deep sediment blue C stocks in southeastern Australia, and (3) map regional 30 cm deep sediment blue C stock magnitude and variability. We had the unique opportunity to use a high-spatial-density C stock dataset of sediments to 30 cm deep from 96 blue C ecosystems across the state of Victoria, Australia, integrated with spatially explicit environmental data to reach these aims. We used an information theoretic approach to create, average, validate, and select the best averaged general linear mixed effects model for predicting C stocks across the state. Ecological drivers (i.e. ecosystem type or ecological vegetation class) best explained variability in C stocks, relative to geomorphological and anthropogenic drivers. Of the geomorphological variables, distance to coast, distance to freshwater, and slope best explained C stock variability. Anthropogenic variables were of least importance. Our model explained 46\% of the variability in 30 cm deep sediment C stocks, and we estimated over 2.31 million Mg C stored in the top 30 cm of sediments in coastal blue C ecosystems in Victoria, 88\% of which was contained within four major coastal areas due to the extent of blue C ecosystems (similar to 87\% of total blue C ecosystem area). Regionally, these data can inform conservation management, paired with assessment of other ecosystem services, by enabling identification of hotspots for protection and key locations for restoration efforts. We recommend these methods be tested for applicability to other regions of the globe for identifying drivers of sediment C stock variability and producing predictive C stock models at scales relevant for resource management.

TI  - Drought-Induced Salinity Enhancement Weakens Mangrove Greennouse Gas Cycling
AB  - The importance of tidal mangroves in mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) via sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has been increasingly recognized, but this climate benefit comes at a biogeochemical cost of methane (CH4) emissions. Previous studies have assessed the net radiative effect of mangrove GHG fluxes, however, large uncertainty still exists due to the very limited availability of long-term continuous measurements. In this study, we analyzed the temporal variations of GHG (CO2 and CH4) fluxes and their environmental controls based on eddy covariance measurements in a subtropical estuarine mangrove in the Southeast China during 2019 and 2020, when a severe drought occurred. The results showed (a) annually this mangrove acted as a CO2 sink of -1,075.8 g C m(-2) and a CH4 source of 3.1 g C m(-2), and the CH4-induced warming effect can offset 4.6\% (9.8\%) of the CO2-induced cooling effect at a 100-year (20-year) time horizon using the metric of sustained-flux global warming potentials; (b) net CO2 and CH4 fluxes showed different diurnal and seasonal variation patterns, with stronger CO2 sink and CH4 source in colder and warmer seasons, respectively; (c) drought-induced salinity enhancement due to reduced rainfall and river discharge weakened GHG cycling, lowering both CO2 sink and CH4 source in the drier year. This study confirms that ecosystem-level CH4 emissions from estuarine mangroves are not negligible and could substantially offset the CO2-induced cooling effect. Future increases in temperature and salinity with expected global warming and sea level rise will likely weaken the climate benefits of mangroves. Plain Language Summary Tidal mangroves have a climate benefit via sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide, but this benefit could be offset by their methane emissions. Due to the lack of long-term continuous and simultaneous measurements of these two greenhouse gas fluxes, we're short of the knowledge on the extent of this climate offset. Drought-induced salinity enhancement could suppress carbon dioxide and methane exchanges given the recognized role of salinity stress on mangrove biogeochemistry. Based on one-and-a-half-year flux tower measurements capturing a severe spring/summer drought event, we examine the responses of greenhouse gas fluxes to environmental factors in particular for drought in a subtropical estuarine mangrove in the Southeast China. As a carbon dioxide sink and a methane source, this mangrove sequesters more carbon dioxide in colder seasons but emits more methane in warmer seasons. Drought-induced salinity enhancement due to reduced rainfall and river discharge weakens greenhouse gas cycling, simultaneously lowering carbon dioxide sink and methane source. This study confirms that the warming effect from methane emissions could substantially offset the cooling effect from carbon dioxide uptake. Future climate change including higher temperature and salinity will likely weaken the climate benefits of mangroves.

TI  - Coastal and estuarine blue carbon stocks in the greater Southeast Asia region: Seagrasses and mangroves per nation and sum of total
AB  - Climate Change solutions include CO2 extraction from atmosphere and water with burial by living habitats in sediment/soil. Nowhere on the planet are blue carbon plants which carry out massive carbon extraction and permanent burial more intensely concentrated than in SE Asia. For the first time we make a national and total inventory of data to date for â€œblue carbonâ€ buried from mangroves and seagrass and delineate the constraints. For an area across Southeast Asia of approximately 12,000,000 km2, supporting mangrove forests (5,116,032 ha) and seagrass meadows (6,744,529 ha), we analyzed the region's current blue carbon stocks. This estimate was achieved by integrating the sum of estuarine in situ carbon stock measurements with the extent of mangroves and seagrass across each nation, then summed for the region. We found that mangroves ecosystems regionally supported the greater amount of organic carbon (3095.19Tg Corg in 1st meter) over that of seagrass (1683.97 Tg Corg in 1st meter), with corresponding stock densities ranging from 15 to 2205 Mg haâˆ’1 and 31.3 to 2450 Mg haâˆ’1 respectively, a likely underestimate for entire carbon including sediment depths. The largest carbon stocks are found within Indonesia, followed by the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Myanmar, Malaysia, Thailand, Tropical China, Viet-Nam, and Cambodia. Compared to the blue carbon hotspot of tropical/subtropical Gulf of Mexico's total carbon stock (480.48 Tg Corg), Southeast Asia's greater mangroveâ€“seagrass stock density appears a more intense Blue Carbon hotspot (4778.66 Tg Corg). All regional Southeast Asian nation states should assist in superior preservation and habitat restoration plus similar measures in the USA &amp; Mexico for the Gulf of Mexico, as apparently these form two of the largest tropical carbon sinks within coastal waters. We hypothesize it is SE Asia's regionally unique oceanicâ€“geologic conditions, placed squarely within the tropics, which are largely responsible for this blue carbon hotspot, that is, consistently high ambient light levels and year-long warm temperatures, together with consistently strong inflow of dissolved carbon dioxide and upwelling of nutrients across the shallow geological plates.

TI  - Preservation and recovery of mangrove ecosystem carbon stocks in abandoned shrimp ponds
AB  - Mangrove forests capture and store exceptionally large amounts of carbon and are increasingly recognised as an important ecosystem for carbon sequestration.Yet land-use change in the tropics threatens this ecosystem and its critical `blue carbon' (carbon stored in marine and coastal habitats) stores. The expansion of shrimp aquaculture is among the major causes of mangrove loss globally. Here, we assess the impact of mangrove to shrimp pond conversion on ecosystem carbon stocks, and carbon losses and gains over time after ponds are abandoned. Our assessment is based on an intensive field inventory of carbon stocks at a coastal setting in Thailand. We show that although up to 70\% of ecosystem carbon is lost when mangroves are converted to shrimp ponds, some abandoned ponds contain deep mangrove soils (>2.5 m) and large carbon reservoirs exceeding 865 t carbon per hectare. We also found a positive recovery trajectory for carbon stocks in the upper soil layer (0-15 cm) of a chronosequence of abandoned ponds, associated with natural mangrove regeneration. Our data suggest that mangrove carbon pools can rebuild in abandoned ponds over time in areas exposed to tidal flushing.

TI  - Contrasting Effects of Local Environmental and Biogeographic Factors on the Composition and Structure of Bacterial Communities in Arid Monospecific Mangrove Soils
AB  - Mangrove forests are important biotic sinks of atmospheric CO2 and play an integral role in nutrient-cycling and decontamination of coastal waters, thereby mitigating climatic and anthropogenic stressors. These services are primarily regulated by the activity of the soil microbiome. To understand how environmental changes may affect this vital part of the ecosystem, it is key to understand the patterns that drive microbial community assembly in mangrove forest soils. High-throughput amplicon sequencing (16S rRNA) was applied on samples from arid Avicennia marina forests across different spatial scales from local to regional. Alongside conventional analyses of community ecology, microbial co-occurrence networks were assessed to investigate differences in composition and structure of the bacterial community. The bacterial community composition varied more strongly along an intertidal gradient within each mangrove forest, than between forests in different geographic regions (Australia/Saudi Arabia). In contrast, co-occurrence networks differed primarily between geographic regions, illustrating that the structure of the bacterial community is not necessarily linked to its composition. The local diversity in mangrove forest soils may have important implications for the quantification of biogeochemical processes and is important to consider when planning restoration activities. IMPORTANCE Mangrove ecosystems are increasingly being recognized for their potential to sequester atmospheric carbon, thereby mitigating the effects of anthropogenically driven greenhouse gas emissions. The bacterial community in the soils plays an important role in the breakdown and recycling of carbon and other nutrients. To assess and predict changes in carbon storage, it is important to understand how the bacterial community is shaped by its environment. Here, we compared the bacterial communities of mangrove forests on different spatial scales, from local within-forest to biogeographic comparisons. The bacterial community composition differed more between distinct intertidal zones of the same forest than between forests in distant geographic regions. The calculated network structure of theoretically interacting bacteria, however, differed most between the geographic regions. Our findings highlight the importance of local environmental factors in shaping the microbial soil community in mangroves and highlight a disconnect between community composition and structure in microbial soil assemblages.

TI  - Carbon in the Coastal Seascape: How Interactions Between Mangrove Forests, Seagrass Meadows and Tidal Marshes Influence Carbon Storage
AB  - Purpose of Review We use the `seascape' concept to explore how interactions between mangrove forests, tidal marshes and seagrass influence the storage of carbon in these ecosystems. Mangrove forests, with the other two `blue carbon' habitats, are exceptionally powerful carbon sinks. Maintaining and enhancing these sinks is an emerging priority in climate change mitigation. However, managing any one ecosystem on its own risks is ignoring important contextual drivers of carbon storage emerging from its place in the seascape. We consider how interactions between these coastal habitats directly or indirectly affect the amounts of carbon they can store. Recent Findings The export of carbon from seagrasses may occur over hundreds or thousands of kilometres, much further than reported for mangroves or tidal marshes. Seagrasses may buffer mangroves from wave impacts, assisting forest regeneration. Trophic cascades supported by contiguous blue carbon habitat may limit excessive herbivory and bioturbation in them but evidence is limited. Summary Direct transfers of carbon between blue carbon habitats are common and are likely to enhance total carbon storage, but our understanding of their contribution to carbon stocks at the seascape level is elementary. There is evidence for indirect enhancement of carbon storage at the seascape by close association of habitats, mostly through the creation and maintenance of propitious conditions by one ecosystem for another. Protection from waves of mangroves by seagrass and protection from excess nutrients and sediment of seagrass by mangroves and tidal marsh are key mechanisms. There is little evidence or theory suggesting negative effects on carbon storage of one blue carbon habitat on another.

TI  - Carbon stock estimation and mapping of mangrove forest using ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 in Benoa Bay Bali, Indonesia
AB  - Mangrove forests in tropics coastlines area play an essential role in carbon fixation and carbon storage. Mangrove forests in coastal areas are very effective and efficient in reducing the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere because mangroves can absorb CO2 through photosynthesis by diffusion through stomata and then store carbon in the form of biomass. With the lack of efforts to manage mangrove forests, it needs to be developed so that forest functions can be utilized sustainably. This paper describes examining the use of remote sensing data, particularly dual-polarization ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data, with the primary objective to estimate the carbon stock of mangrove forests in Benoa Bay, Bali. The carbon stock was estimated by analyzing HV Polarization, Above Ground Biomass (AGB), and ground biomass (BGB). The total carbon stock was obtained by multiplying the total biomass with the organic carbon value of 0.47. The potential carbon stock in the mangrove Benoa Bay area is 209,027.28 ton C to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) of 767,130.11 ton CO2 Sequestration same with 3.87 X 1011 bottles in 2015 and 204.422,59 ton C to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) of 750.230,93 ton CO2 Sequestration same with 3.79 x 1011 bottles in 2020.

TI  - Tidal Flats as a Significant Carbon Reservoir in Global Coastal Ecosystems
AB  - Tidal flats are widely distributed and provide a variety of ecosystem services. Nevertheless, the consequences of tidal flat loss and implications for services such as carbon (C) sequestration have not been assessed. In unvegetated tidal flat ecosystems, sediment is the most important carbon reservoir, similar to that of vegetated coastal wetlands (i.e., mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass). We examined the C stocks and C accumulation rate (CAR) reported from 123 locations of tidal flat around the world and compared these results with data from mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass meadows. The global average CAR of tidal flats is 129.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1), with the top-meter sediments containing on average 86.3 Mg C ha(-1). Globally, tidal flat can bury 6.8 Tg C (24.9 Tg CO2) per year and can store 0.9 Pg C (3.3 Pg CO2) in the top meter sediment. Assuming the same rate of loss tidal flats as in the past three decades and that all disturbed sediment C is remineralized, 4.8 Tg C will be lost from tidal flat sediments every year, equivalent to an emission of 17.6 Tg CO2 to the water column and atmosphere.

TI  - Decomposition as a regulator of carbon accretion in mangroves: a review
AB  - The production and decomposition of litter in mangroves plays a significant role in the nutrient and organic carbon cycles. These can be highly variable both spatially and temporally as a result of numerous factors including tidal range, forest type, abundance and type of herbivorous fauna, temperature, and microbial activity. Mangroves also play an important role in blue carbon sequestration, with their status as carbon sinks crucial in mitigating against greenhouse gas-induced climate change. Blue carbon is a term used to describe the carbon captured by oceans and coastal ecosystems. We review and discuss the current available knowledge regarding sources of organic matter (OM) in mangroves as well as the roles of benthic macrofauna, water and microbial activity in the decomposition of OM in order to gain a better understanding of the decompositional processes that take place. Macrofauna break down and bury litter, thereby improving litter quality, in turn increasing decomposition rates via leaching and microbial activity. Microbial decomposition in mangroves is slow as a result of phenolic concentrations in the litter. A build-up of phenolic compounds inhibits microbial activity leading to the accumulation of OM in mangroves. Although knowledge has improved, there are still gaps in the information available and we still have an incomplete picture of the decompositional process in mangroves, and in particular the formation of blue carbon stores, necessitating further research.

TI  - Blue Carbon in Emissions Markets: Challenges and Opportunities for Mexico
AB  - Mangroves are ecosystems made up of trees or shrubs that develop in the intertidal zone and provide many vital environmental services for livelihoods in coastal areas. They are a habitat for the reproduction of several marine species. They afford protection from hurricanes, tides, sea-level rise and prevent the erosion of the coasts. Just one hectare of mangrove forest can hold up to 1,000 tons of carbon dioxide, more than tropical forests and jungles. Mexico is one of the countries with the greatest abundance of mangroves in the world, with more than 700,000 ha. Blue carbon can be a novel mechanism for promoting communication and cooperation between the investor, the government, the users, and beneficiaries of the environmental services of these ecosystems, creating publicâ€“private-social partnerships through mechanisms such as payment for environmental services, credits, or the voluntary carbon market. This chapter explores the possibilities of incorporating blue carbon in emissions markets. We explore the huge potential of Mexicoâ€™s blue carbon to sequester CO2. Then we analyse the new market instrument that allows countries to sell or transfer mitigation results internationally: The Sustainable Development Mechanism (SDM), established in the Paris Agreement. Secondly, we present the progress of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) to standardize the methodologies to assess their stock and determine the magnitude of the blue carbon sinks. Thirdly, as an opportunity for Mexico, the collaboration with the California cap-and-trade program is analysed. We conclude that blue carbon is a very important mitigation tool to be included in the compensation schemes on regional and global levels. Additionally, mangrove protection is an excellent example of the mitigation-adaptation-sustainable development relationship, as well as fostering of governance by the inclusion of the coastal communities in decision-making and incomes.

TI  - The need for local governance of global commons: The example of blue carbon ecosystems
AB  - To limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C, vast amounts of CO2 will have to be removed from the atmosphere via Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR). Enhancing the CO2 sequestration of ecosystems will require not just one approach but a portfolio of CDR options, including so-called nature-based approaches alongside CDR options that are perceived as more technical. Creating a CDR ``supply curve `` would however imply that all carbon removals are considered to be perfect substitutes. The various co-benefits of nature-based CDR approaches militate against this. We discuss this aspect of nature-based solutions in connection with the enhancement of blue carbon ecosystems (BCE) such as mangrove or seagrass habitats. Enhancing BCEs can indeed contribute to CO2 sequestration, but the value of their carbon storage is low compared to the overall contribution of their ecosystem services to wealth. Furthermore, their property rights are often unclear, i.e. not comprehensively defined or not enforced. Hence, payment schemes that only compensate BCE carbon sequestration could create tradeoffs at the expense of other important, often local, ecosystem services and might not result in socially optimal outcomes. Accordingly, one chance for preserving and restoring BCEs lies in the consideration of all services in potential compensation schemes for local communities. Also, local contexts, management structures, and benefit-sharing rules are crucial factors to be taken into account when setting up international payment schemes to support the use of BCEs and other nature- or ecosystem-based CDR. However, regarding these options as the only hope of achieving more CDR will very probably not bring about the desired outcome, either for climate mitigation or for ecosystem preservation. Unhalted degradation, in turn, will make matters worse due to the large amounts of stored carbon that would be released. Hence, countries committed to climate mitigation in line with the Paris targets should not hide behind vague pledges to enhance natural sinks for removing atmospheric CO2 but commit to scaling up engineered CDR.

TI  - Sediment deposits and organic carbon sequestration along mangrove coasts of the Leizhou Peninsula, southern China
AB  - Mangroves are an important affecter of atmospheric CO2 level via sequestrating carbon and trapping sediments. However, their sequestrating effectiveness varies with vegetation development and sedimentation processes under site-specific hydrogeomorphic settings. In order to detect the determinants of organic carbon sequestration, this study investigated four mangrove fringing locations along the coast of the Leizhou Peninsula. Surface and core sediment samples were collected from these sites and analyzed for grain-size distribution, sedimentary organic carbon content (SOCC) and stable isotope signature (delta C-13(org)). It is found that a significantly higher concentration and density of organic carbon were preserved in the interior surface sediments regardless of location or surface grain size distribution. The sedimentary environments, as indicated by core sediment analysis, are controlled under low-to moderately low-energy conditions. Fluvial action on these sedimentary environments decreases from the river dominated site to the tide dominated site. The more stable energy condition favored both sediment and organic carbon accumulation in the mudflat subzone. However, as revealed by delta C-13 signature, sedimentary organic carbon of the core samples from the four sites was dominantly derived from suspended particulate matter except the tide-dominated offshore core. Whereby, we conclude that vegetation provided control on the surface sedimentary organic carbon distribution via its influence onmangrove debris input and fluid energy condition over the intertidal surface, while hydrogeomorphology determined the long-term organic carbon burial via its impact on the local sedimentation accretion rate and the proportion of autogenous organic carbon sequestration.

TI  - Evaluation of carbon stock in the sediment of two mangrove species, Avicennia marina and Rhizophora mucronata, growing in the Farasan Islands, Saudi Arabia
AB  - The aim of this study was to conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of carbon stock in the sediments of Avicennia marina (black mangrove) and Rhizophora mucronata (red mangrove) along the coastline of an arid region (Farasan Islands, Saudi Arabia). Such information is necessary for the development of any management plan for the mangrove ecosystems along the Saudi Red Sea islands and provide a rationale for the restoration of mangrove forests in Saudi Arabia. A. marina and R. mucronata locations showed significant (P &lt; 0.001) differences in sediment bulk density (SBD) and sediment organic carbon (SOC) concentration with higher mean values for both in the sediments of A. marina. Considering the whole depth of sediment sampled (0â€“50 cm), the highest value of SOC stock (12.3 kg C mâˆ’2) was recorded at A. marina locations and the lowest (10.8 kg C mâˆ’2) at R. mucronata locations. Thus, the SOC stock of A. marina was greater than that of R. mucronata by 114.3%. Consequently, considering the rate of carbon sequestration and the area of mangrove forests (216.4 ha), the total carbon sequestration potential of mangroves in the Farasan Islands ranged between 10.3 Mg C yrâˆ’1 and 11.8 Mg C yrâˆ’1 for R. mucronata and A. marina locations, respectively. Thus, it is necessary to protect and restore these ecosystems for the sequestration of carbon and for their other valuable ecosystem services. Â© 2020

TI  - Examining local community understanding of mangrove carbon mitigation: A case study from Ca Mau province, Mekong River Delta, Vietnam
AB  - Payments for carbon services (C-PFES) is a mechanism used to meet national emission reduction targets via either forest protection or reforestation. However, while carbon is a unique environmental service traded in national and international markets, there are challenges in implementing C-PFES schemes at the local level. Simply put, the views of local participants who will undertake the abatement activities have not been considered. By analysing at the local level the views of potential sellers, potential buyers and intermediaries, this paper investigated the feasibility of applying C-PFES for mangroves in Ca Mau province, Vietnam. While local stakeholders had a strong understanding of the likely impacts of climate change on their production and were aware of the environmental roles of mangroves, the carbon sequestration capacity of mangroves was rarely mentioned, and this will be a challenge in implementing a C-PFES scheme. While potential sellers and intermediaries showed strong support for C-PFES, potential buyers were less likely to join the scheme. As the carbon sequestration capacity of mangroves can also be purchased by international entities, it is recommended that the scope of the current Vietnamese C-PFES scheme be broadened to allow participation of entities from outside Ca Mau province, including private companies, government agencies and international investors. We also identified the need for education training programs to enhance stakeholdersâ€™ perspectives prior to the implementation of C-PFES at the local level. This study provides insights for countries with mangrove ecosystems seeking to implement a C-PFES. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Structural characteristics, above-ground biomass and productivity of mangrove forest situated in areas with different levels of pollution in the Niger Delta, Nigeria
AB  - Productivity is a major driver of carbon sequestration in mangrove ecosystems worldwide. It is hypothesized that hydrocarbon pollution can accelerate litter fall and increase productivity through detoxification. We studied structural characteristics, above ground biomass (AGB) and productivity of mangroves in higher and lower polluted locations in the Niger River Delta, Nigeria. We established four 400 m2 plots in a random block design to test the effects of pollution on mangrove productivity. A total of 1,089 mangrove tree structural characteristics and importance values (IV) were estimated. For productivity, ten litter traps (0.1521 m2) were established within each plot, and emptied monthly for three years, June 2010 â€“ June 2013. Total productivity was significantly different between treatments (F1, 1378Â =Â 9.673, pÂ &lt;.001), with highly polluted having higher total productivity. Flowers (F1, 1378Â =Â 9.673, pÂ &lt;.001) and fruits (F1, 1378Â =Â 9.673, pÂ &lt;.001) productivity varied between treatments too, again with the highly polluted being significantly greater. Our results indicate that pollution increased litter fall, and thus altered productivity in the Niger Delta mangrove. To the best of our understanding, this is the first time productivity has been reported in the primary literature for the Niger Delta mangrove ecosystem. Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Blue Carbon in Coastal Phragmites Wetlands Along the Southern Baltic Sea
AB  - Coastal wetlands are important for carbon (C) storage and sequestration. Still, there are large knowledge gaps concerning the amount of ``blue carbon{''} in coastal wetlands dominated by common reed (Phragmites australis). We quantified carbon stocks at the southern Baltic Sea coast at six representative Phragmites wetland sites at the Darss-Zingst-Bodden Chain (DZBC) and the Strelasund, which include different categories of adjacent land use (arable land, woodland, pasture, urban), topography (totally flat to undulating), and geographical restrictions (dyking). Sediment samples were taken to a depth of 1 m, in line with the IPCC guidelines, and total carbon concentrations and bulk densities were measured in 10 cm intervals. The sites stored, on average, 17.4 kg C m(-2) with large variability between sites, ranging from 1.76 to 88.6 kg C m(-2). The estimated average is generally in good agreement with carbon stocks reported for tidal salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrass meadows. According to our estimation, based on widths of the reed belts and carbon stocks at the sampled sites, approximately 264,600 t of blue carbon could be stored in the coastal reed belts along the DZBC, a typical lagoon system of the southern Baltic Sea. Our study underlines the importance of these unique ecotones between land and sea for storage and sequestration of blue carbon. Since Phragmites is also a common (sometimes invasive) species along other large brackish water basins, such as the Black Sea or Chesapeake Bay, these estimates can be used for improved precision of modeling blue carbon budgets.

TI  - Physiological Responses of Avicennia marina var. acutissima and Bruguiera parviflora under Simulated Rise in Sea Level
AB  - Climate change components such as increased in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and rising sea levels are likely to affect mangrove ecosystems. Healthy mature propagules of A. marina var. acutissima and B. parviflora were subjected to two tidal treatments; shallow and deep; for six months. Shallow treatment mimicked the current tidal fluctuations and deep treatment simulated future tidal conditions under rise in sea level. Deep treatment decreased A(max) of both species and significant two way interactions between tidal treatments and species were observed. A(400) was significantly reduced in the deep treatment in B. parviflora but not in A. marina. Carbon dioxide compensation point was not affected by the tidal treatments but varied significantly between both species. The ratio A(400)/A(max) was significantly lower in the shallow treatment in B. parviflora indicating higher carbon sink potential at moderate tidal flooding whereas A(400)/A(max) of A. marina was less variable between tidal treatments. Chlorophyll conductance was insensitive to tidal flooding but was significantly higher in B. parviflora than in A. marina. Carbon sequestration of B. parviflora was substantially reduced in the deep treatment while the difference between tidal treatments was much less in A. marina. These results indicated that these two species responded differently under tidal flooding where A. marina was less sensitive to tidal. Thus, A. marina is better adapted to the projected climate change than B. parviflora.

This is because of the ability of mangroves to mitigate storm surges and floods as well as their high carbon sequestration and storage capacity. However, there are few detailed studies on the spatial variation in mangrove structure and carbon stocks in Fiji, and this information is essential to support decision making by government and communities, enabling the development of effective mitigation and adaptation responses. We assessed mangrove forest structure in contrasting regions around Fiji's largest island, Viti Levu, within sites managed by indigenous (iTaukei) Fijians. Mangroves of the Ba, Nadroga-Navosa, and Rewa and Tailevu regions showed high variance in both structural complexity and ecosystem carbon stocks. Levels of variation were similar to that observed globally due to variable geomorphological and biophysical settings related to orographic rainfall, freshwater influx, tidal amplitude and cyclonic disturbances. High biomass, structurally complex forests occur on the wetter south-east coast (e.g. the Rewa Delta), while structurally uniform scrub mangroves dominate large areas of mangroves along the north-west (e.g. the Ba Delta) and west coast (e.g. the Tuva Delta). Mangroves of the Ba region displayed considerable damage from tropical cyclones, particularly in taller vegetation. All mangrove sites assessed were important reservoirs of carbon, with results when scaled to the spatial extent of mangroves in Fiji revealing that ecosystem carbon storage is disproportionate to area and equates to 73.3% of the carbon held within terrestrial rainforests, despite occupying just 7.3% of the total area. This underscores the importance of mangroves as valuable carbon sinks in Fiji and the need to develop incentives for improved conservation and restoration. Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Learning from multimodal and multisensor earth observation dataset for improving estimates of mangrove soil organic carbon in Vietnam
AB  - Quantifying mangrove soil organic carbon (SOC) is key to better understanding the global carbon cycle, a critical phenomenon in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, it is challenging to have a large sample size in soil carbon measurements and analysis due to the high costs associated with them. In the current research, we propose a novel hybridized artificial intelligence model based on the categorical boosting regression (CBR) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for feature selection, namely, the CBR-PSO model for estimating mangrove SOC. We integrated multisensor optical (Sentinel-2) and synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2) remote sensing data to construct and verify the proposed model, drawing upon a survey in 85 soil cores at 100 cm depth in the Red River Delta, Vietnam. The CBR-PSO model estimated the mangrove SOC ranging from 44.74 to 91.92Â Mg haâˆ’1 (averageÂ =Â 68.76Â Mg haâˆ’1) with satisfactory accuracy (coefficient of determination (R 2)Â =Â 0.809 and root-mean-square error (RMSE)Â =Â 9.30Â Mg haâˆ’1). We also compared the proposed modelâ€™s capability with four machine learning techniques, i.e. support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR), extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBR), and XGBR-PSO models. We show that multimodal and multisensor earth observation dataset combined with the CBR-PSO model can significantly improve the estimates of mangrove SOC. Our findings contribute novel and advanced machine learning approaches for robustness of SOC estimation using open-source software. Our novel framework, which is automated, fast, and reliable, developed in this study can be easily applicable to other mangrove ecosystems across the world, thus providing insights for a voluntary blue carbon offset marketplace for sustainable mangrove conservation.

TI  - Changes in carbon storage and macrobenthic communities in a mangrove-seagrass ecosystem after the invasion of smooth cordgrass in southern China
AB  - The exotic smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) has invaded intertidal wetlands near the Ronggenshan tidal flats of Beihai, Guangxi, China, where historically seagrasses and mangroves coexisted. We investigated sediment organic carbon (SOC) storage and macrobenthic community structure in the existing mangroves (MG), S. alterniflora (SA), seagrass bed (SG), and unvegetated flat (UnV) habitats following the S. alterniflora invasion. SOC storage increased after S. alternifolia invasion in the SG and UnV habitats. Spartina alterniflora invasion changed the dominant species of the macrobenthos in the original habitats and reduced the diversity of macrobenthos in SG and UnV habitats. Clearly, S. alternifolia invasion can change the ecological functioning of south China's coastal ecosystems by altering carbon sequestration and affecting biodiversity. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Ecosystem type drives tea litter decomposition and associated prokaryotic microbiome communities in freshwater and coastal wetlands at a continental scale
AB  - Wetland ecosystems are critical to the regulation of the global carbon cycle, and there is a high demand for data to improve carbon sequestration and emission models and predictions. Decomposition of plant litter is an important component of ecosystem carbon cycling, yet a lack of knowledge on decay rates in wetlands is an impediment to predicting carbon preservation. Here, we aim to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying the decomposition of standardised green and rooibos tea litter over one year within freshwater and coastal wetland soils across four climates in Australia. We also captured changes in the prokaryotic members of the tea-associated microbiome during this process. Ecosystem type drove differences in tea decay rates and prokaryotic microbiome community composition. Decomposition rates were up to 2-fold higher in mangrove and seagrass soils compared to freshwater wetlands and tidal marshes, in part due to greater leaching-related mass loss. For tidal marshes and freshwater wetlands, the warmer climates had 7â€“16% less mass remaining compared to temperate climates after a year of decomposition. The prokaryotic microbiome community composition was significantly different between substrate types and sampling times within and across ecosystem types. Microbial indicator analyses suggested putative metabolic pathways common across ecosystems were used to breakdown the tea litter, including increased presence of putative methylotrophs and sulphur oxidisers linked to the introduction of oxygen by root in-growth over the incubation period. Structural equation modelling analyses further highlighted the importance of incubation time on tea decomposition and prokaryotic microbiome community succession, particularly for rooibos tea that experienced a greater proportion of mass loss between three and twelve months compared to green tea. These results provide insights into ecosystem-level attributes that affect both the abiotic and biotic controls of belowground wetland carbon turnover at a continental scale, while also highlighting new decay dynamics for tea litter decomposing under longer incubations.

TI  - The Carbon Holdings of Northern Ecuador's Mangrove Forests
AB  - Within a geographic information systems environment, we combine field measures of mangrove tree diameter, mangrove species distribution, and mangrove tree density with remotely sensed measures of mangrove location and mangrove canopy cover to estimate the mangrove carbon holdings of northern Ecuador. We find that the four northern estuaries of Ecuador contain approximately 7,742,999 t (Â±15.47 percent) of standing carbon. Of particularly high carbon holdings are the Rhizophora mangleâ€“dominated mangrove stands found in and around the Cayapas-Mataje Ecological Reserve in northern Esmeraldas Province, Ecuador, and certain stands of Rhizophora mangle in and around the Isla CorazÃ³n y Fragata Wildlife Refuge in central ManabÃ­ Province, Ecuador. Our field-driven mangrove carbon estimate is higher than all but one of the comparison models evaluated. We find that basic latitudinal mangrove carbon models performed at least as well, if not better, than the more complex species-based allometric models in predicting standing carbon levels. In addition, we find that improved results occur when multiple models are combined as opposed to relying on any one single model for mangrove carbon estimates. The high level of carbon contained in these mangrove forests, combined with the future atmospheric carbon sequestration potential they offer, makes it a necessity that they are included in any future payment for ecosystem services strategy aimed at using forest systems to offset CO2 emissions and mitigate predicted CO2-driven temperature increases.

TI  - Changes in carbon pool and stand structure of a native subtropical mangrove forest after inter-planting with exotic species Sonneratia apetala
AB  - In this study, we compared stand structure, biomass and soil carbon pools, and litterfall production between a mixed mangrove forest consisting of Aegiceras corniculatum inter-planted with the exotic Sonneratia apetala and a native monospecific forest dominated by A. corniculatum in the intertidal area of Zhanjiang, Guangdong Province, southeast China. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that inter-planting fast growing exotic mangrove S. apetala into subtropical native mangrove forests will significantly increase C sequestration. Although the tree heights and basal diameters of S. apetala were significantly higher than those of A. corniculatum, the density of the 12-year-old S. apetala trees in the mixed forest was much smaller than that of A. corniculatum in the monospecific forest. In contrast to several previous studies on S. apetala forests planted directly on mangrove-free mudflats, the mixed mangrove forest showed no significant difference in either standing biomass or soil carbon pools from the native monospecific mangrove forest (p = 0.294 and 0.073, respectively) twelve years after inter-planting with S. apetala. Moreover, carbon cycling was likely speeded up after inter-planting S. apetala due to higher litterfall input and lower C/N ratio. Thus, inter-planting fast-growing S. apetala into native mangrove forest is not an effective way to increase carbon sequestration in this subtropical mangrove forest. Given that exotic plant species may exert negative impact on native mangrove species and related epifauna, this fast-growing mangrove species is not suitable for mangrove plantation projects aiming mainly at enhancing carbon sequestration.

TI  - Environmental conditions to support blue carbon storage in mangrove forest: A case study in the mangrove forest, nusa lembongan, bali, indonesia
AB  - Pricillia CC, Patria MP, Herdiansyah H. 2021. Environmental conditions to support blue carbon storage in mangrove forest: A case study in the mangrove forest, Nusa Lembongan, Bali, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 22: 3304-3314. Mangrove ecosystems can provide ecosystem services to mitigate climate change by absorbing and storing carbon in their systems. The question arises of how to manage a mangrove forest to store more carbon. The Nusa Lembongan mangrove forest was examined to assess the optimal environmental settings for blue carbon storage in the mangrove ecosystem. Five stations were selected purposively. The parameters observed in each station were aboveground living biomass, mangrove stand density, clay percentage in soil, bulk density, water content, soil organic carbon (%C), and soil organic nitrogen (%N). Based on this study, the total carbon stock in mangrove forest Nusa Lembongan was 68.10 Â± 20.92 Mg C ha-1 and equals to 249.95 Â± 76.77 MgCO2 ha-1 with a significant contribution of soil carbon stock. This study indicates that the essential parameters that can promote carbon sequestration in mangrove forest Nusa Lembongan were aboveground living biomass, soil organic carbon content and soil organic nitrogen content. In addition, as soil organic carbon content also negatively correlates with bulk density, it also can be considered. These findings can contribute to blue carbon planning and management to improve the effectiveness of the blue carbon project. Â© 2021, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

TI  - Soil greenhouse gas fluxes from tropical coastal wetlands and alternative agricultural land uses
AB  - Coastal wetlands are essential for regulating the global carbon budget through soil carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas (GHG - CO2, CH4, and N2O) fluxes. The conversion of coastal wetlands to agricultural land alters these fluxes' magnitude and direction (uptake/release). However, the extent and drivers of change of GHG fluxes are still unknown for many tropical regions. We measured soil GHG fluxes from three natural coastal wetlands - mangroves, salt marsh, and freshwater tidal forests - and two alternative agricultural land uses - sugarcane farming and pastures for cattle grazing (ponded and dry conditions). We assessed variations throughout different climatic conditions (dry-cool, dry-hot, and wet-hot) within 2 years of measurements (2018-2020) in tropical Australia. The wet pasture had by far the highest CH4 emissions with 1231 +/- 386 mgm(-2) d(-1), which were 200-fold higher than any other site. Dry pastures and sugarcane were the highest emitters of N2O with 55 +/- 9 mgm(-2) d(-1) (wet-hot period) and 11 +/- 3 mgm(-2) d(-1) (hot-dry period, coinciding with fertilisation), respectively. Dry pastures were also the highest emitters of CO2 with 20 +/- 1 gm(-2) d(-1) (wet-hot period). The three coastal wetlands measured had lower emissions, with salt marsh uptake of -0.55 +/- 0.23 and -1.19 +/- 0.08 gm(-2) d(-1) of N2O and CO2, respectively, during the dry-hot period. During the sampled period, sugarcane and pastures had higher total cumulative soil GHG emissions (CH4 C N2O) of 7142 and 56 124CO(2-eq) kg ha(-1) yr(-1) compared to coastal wetlands with 144 to 884CO(2-eq) kg ha(-1) yr(-1) (where CO2-eq is CO2 equivalent). Restoring unproductive sugarcane land or pastures (especially ponded ones) to coastal wetlands could provide significant GHG mitigation.

TI  - Tissue-Specific Transcriptomes Outline Halophyte Adaptive Strategies in the Gray Mangrove (Avicennia marina)
AB  - Avicennia marina forests fulfill essential blue carbon and ecosystem services, including halting coastal erosion and supporting fisheries. Genetic studies of A. marina tissues could yield insight into halophyte adaptive strategies, empowering saline agriculture research. We compare transcriptomes from A. marina pneumatophores, stems, leaves, flowers, seeds, and transcriptomes across four widely divergent environments in the Indo-Pacific (Red Sea, Arabian Gulf, Bay of Bengal, and Red River Delta) to decipher the shared and location-, tissue-, and condition-specific functions. On average, 4.8\% of transcripts per tissue were uniquely expressed in that tissue, and 12.2\% were shared in all five tissues. Flowers' transcript expression was the most distinct, with domain-centric gene ontology analysis showing high enrichment for stimulus-responsive processes, as well as genes implicated in flowering (hydroxygeraniol dehydrogenase, TPM = 3687) and floral scent biosynthesis (e.g., benzoyl\_coenzyme\_A, 2497.2 TPM). Pneumatophores highly expressed antioxidant genes, such as glutathione S-transferase (GST, TPM = 4759) and thioredoxin (TRX, TPM = 936.2), as well as proteins in the GO term `Hydroquinone:oxygen oxidoreductase activity' (enrichment Z = 7.69, FDR-corr. p = 0.000785). Tissue-specific metabolic pathway reconstruction revealed unique processes in the five tissues; for example, seeds showed the most complete expression of lipid biosynthetic and degradation pathways. The leaf transcriptome had the lowest functional diversity among the expressed genes in any tissue, but highly expressed a catalase (TPM = 4181) and was enriched for the GO term `transmembrane transporter activity' (GO:0015238; Z = 11.83; FDR-corr. p = 1.58 x 10(-9)), underscoring the genes for salt exporters. Metallothioneins (MTs) were the highest-expressed genes in all tissues from the cultivars of all locations; the dominant expression of these metal-binding and oxidative-stress control genes indicates they are essential for A. marina in its natural habitats. Our study yields insight into how A. marina tissue-specific gene expression supports halotolerance and other coastal adaptative strategies in this halophytic angiosperm.

TI  - Allometric equations may underestimate the contribution of fine roots to mangrove carbon sequestration
AB  - The biomass and production of fine roots (diameter < 2 mm) are often omitted or derived simply from allometric equations when calculating mangrove carbon sinks. The purpose of this study was to assess the significance of fine roots by measuring the biomass and production of the fine roots in two mangrove species (Kanrielia obovata and Avicennia marina) with distinct root structures. The aboveground portion of K. obovata and A. marina contributed 44\% and 32\% of the total carbon stock, respectively. The nonfine roots accounted for 17\% of the total carbon stock of both mangrove species. The fine roots and dead fine roots of K. obovata contributed 5\% of the total carbon stock, whereas the contribution of fine roots and dead line roots of A. marina, which possessed pneumatophores, was higher (12\%). Comparison of the field measurements with the estimates of belowground net production derived from frequently used allometric equations showed that equation-derived estimates were notably underestimated, particularly for A. marina. The aboveground net production of K. obovata and A. marina averaged 17.04 and 7.46 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, but 84\% and 92\% of the litterfall was lost after a year. Subtracting only 4\% of the line root production of K. obovata and 17\% of the fine root production of A. marina to account for further decomposition in the soils within a year, an additional 13.67 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) for K. obovata and 11.05 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) for A. marina were calculated to be buried in the soils, which can increase the carbon sequestration capacity estimated from aboveground litterfall only by 5 and 19 times, respectively, for each mangrove species. This suggests that the contribution of fine roots should be accounted for when estimating mangrove carbon sinks.

TI  - Carbon sequestration by mangrove forest: One approach for managing carbon dioxide emission from coal-based power plant
AB  - Mangroves are known as natural carbon sinks, taking CO2 out of the atmosphere and store it in their biomass for many years. This study aimed to investigate the capacity of world's largest mangrove, the Sundarbans (Indian part) to sequester anthropogenic CO2 emitted from the proximate coal-based thermal power plant in Kolaghat (âˆ¼100 km away from mangrove site). Study also includes Kolkata, one of the largest metropolises of India (âˆ¼150 km away from mangrove site) for comparing micrometeorological parameters, biosphere-atmosphere CO2 exchange fluxes and atmospheric pollutants between three distinct environments: mangrove-power plant-metropolis. Hourly sampling of atmospheric CO2 in all three sites (late December 2011 and early January 2012) revealed that CO2 concentrations and emission fluxes were maximum around the power plant (360â€“621 ppmv, 5.6â€“56.7 mg mâˆ’2sâˆ’1 respectively) followed by the metropolis (383â€“459 ppmv, 3.8â€“20.4 mg mâˆ’2sâˆ’1 respectively) and mangroves (277â€“408 ppmv, âˆ’8.9â€“11.4 mg mâˆ’2sâˆ’1, respectively). Monthly coal consumption rates (41â€“57, in 104 ton monthâˆ’1) were converted to CO2 suggesting that 2.83 Tg C was added to the atmosphere in 2011 for the generation of 7469732 MW energy from the power plant. Indian Sundarbans (4264 km2) sequestered total of 2.79 Tg C which was 0.64% of the annual fossil fuel emission from India in the same time period. Based on these data from 2010 to 2011, it is calculated that about 4328 km2 mangrove forest coverage is needed to sequester all CO2 emitted from the Kolaghat power plant. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Land use changes affecting soil organic carbon storage along a mangrove swamp rice chronosequence in the Cacheu and Oio regions (northern Guinea-Bissau)
AB  - Guinea-Bissau has the largest area of mangrove swamp rice, an important cropping system that significantly contribute to the food security of the nation. Attempts to reclaim mangrove swamps for rice growing have shown the importance of a greater knowledge on the effects of land use change on soil properties and soil carbon storage. To address this problem, a study was undertaken within Cacheur and Oio regions in Northern Guinea-Bissau, along the following chronosequence: mangrove, rice and abandoned fields. Changes in C/N ratio, delta C-13 and delta N-15 values were used to study the dynamics of C-3 plant-derived and marine-derived carbon (C) in order to analyze the origin of soil organic matter (SOM) and estimate the impact of marine contribution to SOC. Isotopic signatures within the mangrove swamp rice soils suggested the inwelling of marine derived C. SOC stock was estimated in 0-10, 0-20, 0-40 and 0-80 cm soil layers using fixed soil depth (FD) and fixed soil mass (FM) approaches. The significantly highest values were found in mangrove soils and the lowest in the abandoned fields for both sites, while no significant differences were recorded for the topsoil (0-10 cm) between mangrove and rice fields. The results of this study revealed that conversion of mangrove to rice cropping has technical potential of SOC sequestration in the upper part of the soil (0-40 cm). On the other hand, the abandonment of the fields caused decreases in carbon storage along the whole soil depth. These findings may have important implications for national forest carbon monitoring systems and regional level reducing emission from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) strategies.

TI  - Quantifying the above ground biomass of krishna mangroves through remote sensing
AB  - Mangroves are salt tolerant woody plants that form highly productive intertidal ecosystems in tropical and subtropical regions. Mangroves play a disproportionately large role in carbon sequestration relative to other tropical forest ecosystems. The carbon emissions resulting from mangrove loss especially biomass are uncertain. The point to be noted that mangroves biomass towards carbon stock is needed because when the changes occurs, much of carbon stock in the ecosystem will release to the atmosphere which may result in global warming, pollution etc. In this context, remote sensing is a tool of choice to provide spatio-temporal information on mangrove ecosystem biomass and carbon studies through digital image processing and modeling. Remote sensing techniques have demonstrated a high potential to detect, identify, map and monitor mangrove conditions and changes. The Krishna mangroves in Andhra Pradesh are located in the coastal plains of Krishna delta. This study provides reviews and highlighting remotely sensed data applied for measuring Above Ground Biomass (AGB) in Krishna mangrove forest from remote sensing perspective. This study assessed tree above ground biomass using a Support vector machine regression model equation. The Above Ground Biomass estimated from the model was 198.47 Mg/ha and an Allometric equation for Avicennia marina mangrove species was used to cross validate the estimated AGB from remote sensing technique and the average AGB from the field measurement was 217.53 Mg/ha. Thus the study reveals that the remote sensing is an effective tool to estimate above ground biomass with a good accuracy. Copyright Â© 2017 ISRS, All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Carbon Storage Increases with Site Age as Created Salt Marshes Transition to Mangrove Forests in Tampa Bay, Florida (USA)
AB  - Coastal wetlands can sequester large amounts of organic carbon (OC), providing an additional motivation for the preservation and restoration of these ecosystems. In Tampa Bay (Florida, USA), created coastal wetlands are initially planted with Spartina spp., but nearly all sites naturally transition into mangrove forests. It was hypothesized that carbon storage in the created wetlands would increase with site age due to the accumulation of soil organic carbon and replacement of salt marsh vegetation with mangrove forests. Mature, mangrove-dominated sites had higher total organic carbon stocks (138.7 +/- 13.8 Mg C ha(-1)) than middle-aged transitional sites (85.6 +/- 25.5 Mg C ha(-1)) or young salt marshes (34.5 +/- 7.7 Mg C ha(-1)). Mature sites consisted of tall trees (> 130 cm tall) and scarce salt marsh vegetation. Transitional sites contained mangrove scrubs (30-130 cm tall) and seedlings (< 30 cm tall) while still supporting salt marsh vegetation; younger sites were dominated by salt marsh vegetation and had no trees. Belowground OC constituted the greatest carbon pool (59.4\% of the total OC stock), but belowground OC stocks were not significantly different among the site age classes, suggesting that aboveground OC stocks drove the difference in total OC stocks. The total carbon accumulation rate, including both aboveground and belowground OC, was 4.7 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) across the 26-year chronosequence. This study has demonstrated that carbon storage in created coastal wetlands is correlated to wetland age, indicating that these ecosystems have the potential to become significant sources of OC storage.

TI  - The â€˜perfectâ€™ conversion: Dramatic increase in co2 efflux from shellfish ponds and mangrove conversion in china
AB  - Aquaculture, particularly shellfish ponds, has expanded dramatically and become a major cause of mangrove deforestation and â€œblue carbonâ€ loss in China. We present the first study to examine CO2 efflux from marine aquaculture/shellfish ponds and in relation to land-use change from mangrove forests in China. Light and dark sediment CO2 efflux from shellfish ponds averaged at 0.61 Â± 0.07 and 0.90 Â± 0.12 kg CO2 mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1 (= 37.67 Â± 4.89 and 56.0 Â± 6.13 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1), respectively. The corresponding rates (âˆ’4.21 Â± 4.54 and 41.01 Â± 4.15 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1) from the adjacent mangrove forests that were devoid of aquaculture wastewater were lower, while those from the adjacent mangrove forests (3.48 Â± 7.83 and 73.02 Â± 5.76 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1)) receiving aquaculture wastewater markedly increased. These effluxes are significantly higher than those reported for mangrove forests to date, which is attributable to the high nutrient levels and the physical disturbance of the substrate associated with the aquaculture operation. A rise of 1 Â°C in the sediment temperature resulted in a 6.56% rise in CO2 released from the shellfish ponds. Combined with pond area data, the total CO2 released from shellfish ponds in 2019 was estimated to be ~12 times that in 1983. The total annual CO2 emission from shellfish ponds associated with mangrove conversion reached 2-5 Tg, offsetting the C storage by mangrove forests in China. These are significant environmental consequences rather than just a simple shift of land use. Around 30% higher CO2 emissions are expected from aquaculture ponds (including shellfish ponds) compared to shellfish ponds alone. Total annual CO2 emission from shellfish ponds will likely decrease to the level reported in early 1980 under the pond area-shrinking scenario, but it will be more than doubled under the business-as-usual scenario projected for 2050. This study highlights the necessity of curbing the expansion of aquaculture ponds in valuable coastal wetlands and increasing mangrove restoration to abandoned ponds. Â© 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Belowground carbon sequestration in a mature planted mangroves (Northern Viet Nam)
AB  - Mangroves play a key role in carbon sequestration along tropical and subtropical coastlines, mainly as a result of their high primary productivity and the anoxic character of their soils, in which organic matter decay processes are slow. Unfortunately, these forests are disappearing worldwide, notably due to aquaculture and the need for space on the shoreline. The mangrove area in Viet Nam decreased substantially until late 90's, which was a concern for the Vietnamese government. Then, replantation programs were developed in order to protect the shoreline against the erosion; like in northern Viet Nam, where monospecific stands were planted from the mid 90's. Within this context, our objectives were to determine carbon stocks and carbon burial rates in the soil of a 18 years old Kandelia obovata (Sheue, Lui &amp; Yong) mangrove forest. Three plots were set up in the planted mangroves and three in adjacent bare land (without any mangrove) at the mouth of Red River. Three geo-slicers up to 100 cm depth were taken in each plot; and in each core, ten soil samples were collected with a 10 cm depth interval. Later on, dead and live roots were sorted. Carbon contents in soils and in roots were determined using the Walkley-Black method and loss on ignition (LOI) method, respectively. Then, the total belowground carbon sequestration was estimated. There was a depth related distribution of organic carbon in soil with the highest concentrations measured between 20 and 60 cm depth. Accumulated carbon up to depth of 100 cm in soil and roots of the planted K. obovata were 146.78 Â± 3.87 Mg OC haâˆ’1 and 12.67 Â± 0.14 Mg OC haâˆ’1, respectively. The value was 87.59 Â± 1.08 Mg OC haâˆ’1 for the adjacent bare land. Consequently, the mean carbon burial rate for this system was approximately 6.94 Mg OC haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1, which is higher than most of the mangroves and may be related to a low export of the net primary productivity or most likely to a high sedimentation rate. These results were compared with previously published results on carbon stocks in younger planted forests of the same species in the same region, a positive and linear relationship was determined between the age of the planted stand and the belowground carbon stocks.

TI  - A Review of Remote Sensing Approaches for Monitoring Blue Carbon Ecosystems: Mangroves, Seagrasses and Salt Marshes during 2010-2018
AB  - Blue carbon (BC) ecosystems are an important coastal resource, as they provide a range of goods and services to the environment. They play a vital role in the global carbon cycle by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impacts of climate change. However, there has been a large reduction in the global BC ecosystems due to their conversion to agriculture and aquaculture, overexploitation, and removal for human settlements. Effectively monitoring BC ecosystems at large scales remains a challenge owing to practical difficulties in monitoring and the time-consuming field measurement approaches used. As a result, sensible policies and actions for the sustainability and conservation of BC ecosystems can be hard to implement. In this context, remote sensing provides a useful tool for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems faster and at larger scales. Numerous studies have been carried out on various sensors based on optical imagery, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), aerial photographs (APs), and multispectral data. Remote sensing-based approaches have been proven effective for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems by a large number of studies. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review on the applications of remote sensing techniques for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems. The main goal of this review is to provide an overview and summary of the key studies undertaken from 2010 onwards on remote sensing applications for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems. Our review showed that optical imagery, such as multispectral and hyper-spectral data, is the most common for mapping BC ecosystems, while the Landsat time-series are the most widely-used data for monitoring their changes on larger scales. We investigate the limitations of current studies and suggest several key aspects for future applications of remote sensing combined with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for mapping coastal vegetation and monitoring their extents and changes.

TI  - Surface evolution and carbon sequestration in disturbed and undisturbed wetland soils of the Hunter estuary, southeast Australia
AB  - The aim of this work was to quantify the soil carbon storage and sequestration rates of undisturbed natural wetlands and disturbed wetlands subject to restriction of tidal flow and subsequent rehabilitation in an Australian estuary. Disturbed and undisturbed estuarine wetlands of the Hunter estuary, New South Wales, Australia were selected as the study sites for this research. Vertical accretion rates of estuarine substrates were combined with soil carbon concentrations and bulk densities to determine the carbon store and carbon sequestration rates of the substrates tested. Relationships between estuary water level, soil evolution and vertical accretion were also examined. The carbon sequestration rate of undisturbed wetlands was lower (15\% for mangrove and 55\% for saltmarsh) than disturbed wetlands, but the carbon store was higher (65\% for mangrove and 60\% for saltmarsh). The increased carbon sequestration rate of the disturbed wetlands was driven by substantially higher rates of vertical accretion (95\% for mangrove and 345\% for saltmarsh). Estuarine wetland carbon stores were estimated at 700-1000 Gg C for the Hunter estuary and 3900-5600 Gg C for New South Wales. Vertical accretion and carbon sequestration rates of estuarine wetlands in the Hunter are at the lower end of the range reported in the literature. The comparatively high carbon sequestration rates reported for the disturbed wetlands in this study indicate that wetland rehabilitation has positive benefits for regulation of atmospheric carbon concentrations, in addition to more broadly accepted ecosystem services.

TI  - Precision of mangrove sediment blue carbon estimates and the role of coring and data analysis methods
AB  - Carbon accumulation in coastal wetlands is normally assessed by extracting a sediment core and estimating its carbon content and bulk density. Because carbon content and bulk density are functionally related, the latter can be estimated gravimetrically from a section of the core or, alternatively, from the carbon content in the sample using the mixing model equation from soil science. Using sediment samples from La Paz Bay, Mexico, we analyzed the effect that the choice of corer and the method used to estimate bulk density could have on the final estimates of carbon storage in the sediments. We validated the results using a larger dataset of tropical mangroves, and then by Monte Carlo simulation. The choice of corer did not have sizable influence on the final estimates of carbon density. The main factor in selecting a corer is the operational difficulties that each corer may have in different types of sediments. Because of the multiplication of errors in a product of two variables subject to random sampling error, when using gravimetric estimates of bulk density, the dispersion of the data points in the estimation of total carbon density rises rapidly as the amount of carbon in the sediment increases. In contrast, the estimation of total carbon density using only the carbon fraction as a predictor is very precise, especially in sediments rich in organic matter. This method, however, depends critically on the accurate estimation of the two parameters of the mixing model: the bulk density of pure peat and the bulk density of pure mineral sediment. The estimation of carbon densities in peaty sediments can be very imprecise when using gravimetric bulk densities. Estimating carbon density in peaty sediments using only the estimate of organic fraction can be much more precise, provided the model parameters are estimated with accuracy. These results open the door for simplified and precise estimates of carbon dynamics in mangroves and coastal wetlands. Â© 2022 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Changes in Ecosystem Nitrogen and Carbon Allocation with Black Mangrove (Avicennia germinans) Encroachment into Spartina alterniflora Salt Marsh
AB  - Increases in temperature are expected to facilitate encroachment of tropical mangrove forests into temperate salt marshes, yet the effects on ecosystem services are understudied. Our work was conducted along a mangrove expansion front in Louisiana (USA), an area where coastal wetlands are in rapid decline due to compounding factors, including reduced sediment supply, rising sea level, and subsidence. Marsh and mangrove ecosystems are each known for their ability to adjust to sea-level rise and support numerous ecosystem services, but there are some differences in the societal benefits they provide. Here, we compare carbon and nitrogen stocks and relate these findings to the expected effects of mangrove encroachment on nitrogen filtration and carbon sequestration in coastal wetlands. We specifically evaluate the implications of black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) encroachment intoSpartina alterniflora-dominated salt marsh. Our results indicate that black mangrove encroachment will lead to increased aboveground carbon and nitrogen stocks. However, we found no differences in belowground (that is, root and sediment) nitrogen or carbon stocks between marshes and mangroves. Thus, the shift from marsh to mangrove may provide decadal-scale increases in aboveground nitrogen and carbon sequestration, but belowground nitrogen and carbon sequestration (that is, carbon burial) may not be affected. We measured lower pore water nitrogen content beneath growing mangroves, which we postulate may be due to greater nitrogen uptake and storage in mangrove aboveground compartments compared to marshes. However, further studies are needed to better characterize the implications of mangrove encroachment on nitrogen cycling, storage, and export to the coastal ocean.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF THE ABILITY OF MANGROVE SEQUESTRATION AND CARBON STOCK IN PEJARAKAN VILLAGE, BULELENG REGENCY, BALI
AB  - Mangroves have a major role as carbon absorption and stock. However, this potential cannot be maximized, due to the high level of mangrove damage. The research question is the extent of the ability of mangroves to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) and store it in the form of biomass. The purpose of this study was to determine the absorption ability and carbon stock of various types of mangove. The research location was chosen in Pejarakan village, Buleleng Regency, Bali Province, Indonesia as a case study. The method used is non-destructive to obtain diameter data at the height of mangrove trees, by collecting garbage and sediment samples manually on the floor of mangrove forests and to motivate the Government and local communities to restore mangrove forests. The results showed that the high density types of Sonneratia alba turned out to have the ability to absorb and store carbon, compared to other mangrove species. The results showed that S. alba is estimated to have the ability to absorb 57.60 tons of CO2 ha(-1) which is equivalent to 15.71 tons C ha(-1). While the lowest value is the Osbornia octodonta with the lowest density value. S. alba's ability to store carbon is 5.56 tons of CO2 ha(-1) or equivalent to 1.52 tons C ha(-1). The conclusion is that S. alba has the highest ability to absorb and store carbon.

TI  - Climate change mitigation potential of wetlands and the cost-effectiveness of their restoration
AB  - The cost-effective mitigation of climate change through nature-based carbon dioxide removal strategies has gained substantial policy attention. Inland and coastal wetlands (specifically boreal, temperate and tropical peatlands; tundra; floodplains; freshwater marshes; saltmarshes; and mangroves) are among the most efficient natural long-term carbon sinks. Yet, they also release methane (CH 4) that can offset the carbon they sequester. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis on wetland carbon dynamics to (i) determine their impact on climate using different metrics and time horizons, (ii) investigate the cost-effectiveness of wetland restoration for climate change mitigation, and (iii) discuss their suitability for inclusion in climate policy as negative emission technologies. Depending on metrics, a wetland can simultaneously be a net carbon sink (i.e. boreal and temperate peatlands net ecosystem carbon budget =-28.1 Â± 19.13 gC m-2 y-1) but have a net warming effect on climate at the 100 years time-scale (i.e. boreal and temperate peatland sustained global warming potential = 298.2 Â± 100.6 gCO 2 eq-1 m-2 y-1). This situation creates ambivalence regarding the effect of wetlands on global temperature. Moreover, our review reveals high heterogeneity among the (limited number of) studies that document wetland carbon budgets. We demonstrate that most coastal and inland wetlands have a net cooling effect as of today. This is explained by the limited CH 4 emissions that undisturbed coastal wetlands produce, and the long-term carbon sequestration performed by older inland wetlands as opposed to the short lifetime of CH 4 in the atmosphere. Analysis of wetland restoration costs relative to the amount of carbon they can sequester revealed that restoration is more cost-effective in coastal wetlands such as mangroves (US$1800 ton C-1) compared with inland wetlands (US$4200-49 200 ton C-1). We advise that for inland wetlands, priority should be given to conservation rather than restoration; while for coastal wetlands, both conservation and restoration may be effective techniques for climate change mitigation.

TI  - Blue carbon: Knowledge gaps, critical issues, and novel approaches
AB  - Blue carbon - the carbon stored and sequestered in mangrove forests, seagrass meadows, and tidal salt marshes is considered a cost-effective means to achieve positive climate change mitigation and adaptation outcomes. Blue carbon is therefore of considerable interest to the scientific and policy communities, and is frequently discussed in relation to carbon markets and climate finance opportunities. This paper identifies peer-reviewed and `gray literature' documents that discuss blue carbon in the context of finance and market mechanisms. The document set is analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively, and the principal scientific, economic, regulatory, social, and management issues that emerge are discussed. The study reveals that (1) the blue carbon literature is dominated by technical and policy commentary, with a dearth of research into practical social considerations and a stark absence of private sector perspectives; (2) there is confusion over the nature and role of important concepts including private and public sector finance and instruments; and (3) understanding of the important issues of investment priorities and risk considerations is also limited. This paper therefore identifies gaps in the blue carbon literature, clarifies critical concepts and issues, and proposes novel pathways for blue carbon research and project development (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Mapping of mangrove forest and carbon stock estimation of east coast Surabaya, Indonesia
AB  - The mangrove forests on Surabaya's east coast are an important protected area, providing habitat for a variety of marine organisms and water birds. This area is also vital for carbon storage and sequestration. The purpose of this research is to determine the changes in mangrove areas over the last 20 years and to calculate the amount of carbon stored in these mangrove forests. Changes in the area of mangrove forests and Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVI) were determined using Landsat-7 in 2000 and Landsat-8 in 2020. The vegetative carbon stock of mangrove stands was calculated using allometric measurements. The study results reveal that the mangrove forest area has increased significantly from 257.13 ha in 2000 to 753.48 ha in 2020. The results of regression models also show that NDVI has a significant influence on aboveground biomass (AGB), as indicated by the coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.7 (F test, df = 28, p-value &lt; 0.05). The estimated aboveground and belowground carbon stock is 46.35 Â± 13.65 ton C ha-1 and 13.65 Â± 6.74 ton C ha-1 respectively. Accordingly, it is observed that the mangrove forest of East Coast Surabaya can sequester at least a total of 192.72 tons CO2 ha-1 in above and belowground biomass.

TI  - Non-native mangroves support carbon storage, sediment carbon burial, and accretion of coastal ecosystems
AB  - Mangrove forests play an important role in climate change adaptation and mitigation by maintaining coastline elevations relative to sea level rise, protecting coastal infrastructure from storm damage, and storing substantial quantities of carbon (C) in live and detrital pools. Determining the efficacy of mangroves in achieving climate goals can be complicated by difficulty in quantifying C inputs (i.e., differentiating newer inputs from younger trees from older residual C pools), and mitigation assessments rarely consider potential offsets to CO2 storage by methane (CH4) production in mangrove sediments. The establishment of non-native Rhizophora mangle along Hawaiian coastlines over the last century offers an opportunity to examine the role mangroves play in climate mitigation and adaptation both globally and locally as novel ecosystems. We quantified total ecosystem C storage, sedimentation, accretion, sediment organic C burial and CH4 emissions from similar to 70 year old R. mangle stands and adjacent uninvaded mudflats. Ecosystem C stocks of mangrove stands exceeded mudflats by 434 +/- 33 Mg C/ha, and mangrove establishment increased average coastal accretion by 460\%. Sediment organic C burial increased 10-fold (to 4.5 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)), double the global mean for old growth mangrove forests, suggesting that C accumulation from younger trees may occur faster than previously thought, with implications for mangrove restoration. Simulations indicate that increased CH4 emissions from sediments offset ecosystem CO2 storage by only 2\%-4\%, equivalent to 30-60 Mg CO2-eq/ha over mangrove lifetime (100 year sustained global warming potential). Results highlight the importance of mangroves as novel systems that can rapidly accumulate C, have a net positive atmospheric greenhouse gas removal effect, and support shoreline accretion rates that outpace current sea level rise. Sequestration potential of novel mangrove forests should be taken into account when considering their removal or management, especially in the context of climate mitigation goals.

TI  - The `Perfect' Conversion: Dramatic Increase in CO2 Efflux from Shellfish Ponds and Mangrove Conversion in China
AB  - Aquaculture, particularly shellfish ponds, has expanded dramatically and become a major cause of mangrove deforestation and ``blue carbon{'' loss in China. We present the first study to examine CO2 efflux from marine aquaculture/shellfish ponds and in relation to land-use change from mangrove forests in China. Light and dark sediment CO2 efflux from shellfish ponds averaged at 0.61 +/- 0.07 and 0.90 +/- 0.12 kg CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) (= 37.67 +/- 4.89 and 56.0 +/- 6.13 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), respectively. The corresponding rates (-4.21 +/- 4.54 and 41.01 +/- 4.15 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) from the adjacent mangrove forests that were devoid of aquaculture wastewater were lower, while those from the adjacent mangrove forests (3.48 +/- 7.83 and 73.02 +/- 5.76 mmol m(-2) d(-1))) receiving aquaculture wastewater markedly increased. These effluxes are significantly higher than those reported for mangrove forests to date, which is attributable to the high nutrient levels and the physical disturbance of the substrate associated with the aquaculture operation. A rise of 1 degrees C in the sediment temperature resulted in a 6.56\% rise in CO2 released from the shellfish ponds. Combined with pond area data, the total CO2 released from shellfish ponds in 2019 was estimated to be \~{}12 times that in 1983. The total annual CO2 emission from shellfish ponds associated with mangrove conversion reached 2-5 Tg, offsetting the C storage by mangrove forests in China. These are significant environmental consequences rather than just a simple shift of land use. Around 30\% higher CO2 emissions are expected from aquaculture ponds (including shellfish ponds) compared to shellfish ponds alone. Total annual CO2 emission from shellfish ponds will likely decrease to the level reported in early 1980 under the pond area-shrinking scenario, but it will be more than doubled under the business-as-usual scenario projected for 2050. This study highlights the necessity of curbing the expansion of aquaculture ponds in valuable coastal wetlands and increasing mangrove restoration to abandoned ponds.

TI  - Wood density and carbon estimates of mangrove species in Kuala Sepetang, Perak, Malaysia
AB  - Mangrove forests provide a broad array of ecosystem services including fisheries production, sediment regulation, wood production and protection from storms and waves. Mangroves also may have an important role as a pool in global carbon budgets and in mitigating climate change. Here we investigated the wood density and carbon content of the mangrove species in Kuala Sepetang, Perak. Using data from 13 mangrove species, the value for wood density and carbon were estimated. Wood density ranged from 0.33 gcm-3 to 0.64 gcm-3, where the lowest and highest values were given by Sonneratia caseolaris and Ceriops tagal, respectively. The carbon content was 42.48% on average, where Bruguiera cylindrica gave the lowest value at 45.13 % while Lumnitzera racemosa was the highest at 45%. These values suggest that Kuala Sepetang mangrove forest has the potential to sequester and store substantial amounts of atmospheric carbon.

TI  - Estimation of carbon pools in the biomass and soil of mangrove forests in Sirik Azini creek, Hormozgan province (Iran)
AB  - Despite the increasing interest in mangroves as one of the most carbon-rich ecosystems, arid mangroves are still poorly investigated. We aimed to improve the knowledge of biomass and soil carbon sequestration for an arid mangrove forest located at the Azini creek, Sirik, Hormozgan Province (Iran). We investigated the biomass and organic carbon stored in the above and belowground biomass for three different regions selected based on the composition of the principal species: (1) Avicennia marina, (2) mixed forest of A. marina and Rhizophora mucronata, and (3) R. mucronata. Topsoil organic carbon storage to 30Â cm depth was also estimated for each analyzed area. Biomass carbon storage, considering both aboveground (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB), was significantly different between the cover areas. Overall, the mean forest biomass (MFB) was 283.1 Â± 89Â Mg C haâˆ’1 with a mean C stored in the biomass of 128.9 Â± 59Â Mg C haâˆ’1. Although pure Rhizophora stand showed the lowest value of above and below tree carbon (AGC + BGC); 17.6 Â± 1.9Â Mg C haâˆ’1), soil organic carbon stock in sites under Rhizophora spp. was significantly higher than in the site with pure stand of Avicennia spp. Overall, forest soil stored the highest proportion of Sirik mangrove ecosystem organic carbon (59%), with a mean value of 188.3 Â± 27Â Mg C haâˆ’1. These results will contribute to broaden the knowledge and the dataset available, reducing the uncertainties related to estimates and modeling of carbon pools in arid mangrove ecosystem, which also represent an important climatic threshold of mangrove worldwide distribution.

TI  - The Right Place at the Right Time: Seasonal Variation of Bacterial Communities in Arid Avicennia marina Soils in the Red Sea Is Specific to Its Position in the Intertidal
AB  - Mangrove forests play an important role in facilitating biogeochemical pathways and cycling acting as blue carbon sinks. These services are primarily regulated by the activity of the soil microbiome. However, there is still limited research into spatial and temporal variation patterns of bacterial community assemblages in mangrove soils. This study investigated important ecological scales of microprocesses that govern microbial communities in an arid mangrove ecosystem. Shifts in microbial community composition were influenced by fluctuations in environmental factors within the mangrove forests of the Red Sea influenced by seasonal changes in sea level. Notably, in summer microbial communities in shrub sites differed significantly from the fringe and the winter samples, with lower alpha diversity yet a higher dominance of specialized species capable of surviving in extreme conditions. The onset of dispersal limitation and heterogenous selection and the reduction of drift are likely the main forces shaping community assemblages. Specifically, in summer lower mean tidal levels eliminate tidal inundation creating a harsh high salinity and high temperature environment with no tidal connection thereby influencing the onset of dispersal limitation. An increased understanding of the spatial and temporal variation of bacterial communities is critical when assessing delivery of ecosystem services and their role in soil biogeochemical processes.

TI  - Perspective: Increasing blue carbon around Antarctica is an ecosystem service of considerable societal and economic value worth protecting
AB  - Precautionary conservation and cooperative global governance are needed to protect Antarctic blue carbon: the world's largest increasing natural form of carbon storage with high sequestration potential. As patterns of ice loss around Antarctica become more uniform, there is an underlying increase in carbon capture-to-storage-to-sequestration on the seafloor. The amount of carbon captured per unit area is increasing and the area available to blue carbon is also increasing. Carbon sequestration could further increase under moderate (+1 degrees C) ocean warming, contrary to decreasing global blue carbon stocks elsewhere. For example, in warmer waters, mangroves and seagrasses are in decline and benthic organisms are close to their physiological limits, so a 1 degrees C increase in water temperature could push them above their thermal tolerance (e.g. bleaching of coral reefs). In contrast, on the basis of past change and current research, we expect that Antarctic blue carbon could increase by orders of magnitude. The Antarctic seafloor is biophysically unique and the site of carbon sequestration, the benthos, faces less anthropogenic disturbance than any other ocean continental shelf environment. This isolation imparts both vulnerability to change, and an avenue to conserve one of the world's last biodiversity refuges. In economic terms, the value of Antarctic blue carbon is estimated at between 0.65 pound and 1.76 pound billion (similar to 2.27 billion USD) for sequestered carbon in the benthos around the continental shelf. To balance biodiversity protection against society's economic objectives, this paper builds on a proposal incentivising protection by building a `non-market framework' via the 2015 Paris Agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This could be connected and coordinated through the Antarctic Treaty System to promote and motivate member states to value Antarctic blue carbon and maintain scientific integrity and conservation for the positive societal values ingrained in the Antarctic Treaty System.

TI  - Coastal Blue Carbon Assessment of Mangroves, Salt Marshes, and Salt Barrens in Tampa Bay, Florida, USA
AB  - Compared to other terrestrial environments, coastal ``blue carbon{'' habitats such as salt marshes and mangrove forests sequester disproportionately large amounts of carbon as standing plant biomass and peat deposits. This study quantified organic carbon stocks in 16 salt marshes, salt barrens, and mangrove forests in Tampa Bay, Florida, USA. The sites included natural, restored, and created wetlands of varying ages and degrees of anthropogenic impacts. Peat deposits were generally less than 30-cm deep and organic content rapidly decreased with depth in all habitats. The top 15 cm of mangrove soil contained an average of 11.0\% organic carbon by weight, salt marshes contained 6.6\%, and salt barrens contained 1.0\%. Total organic carbon stock in mangroves was 133.6 +/- 12.8 Mg ha(-1), with 69.5\% of that carbon stored belowground. Salt marshes contained 66.4 +/- 25.0 Mg ha(-1) (93.5\% belowground carbon), and salt barrens contained 26.6 +/- 8.3 Mg ha(-1) (96.1\% belowground carbon). These values were much lower than global averages for carbon stocks in mangroves and salt marshes, likely due to Tampa Bay's location near the northern limit of mangrove habitat, sandy soil, young age of the restored wetlands, presence of mosquito ditches, and recent habitat conversion from salt marshes to mangroves. In the late 1800s, Tampa Bay's coastal wetlands were dominated by salt marshes, but today they are dominated by mangroves. Based on the blue carbon values from the natural sites in this study, this habitat switching has led to the additional sequestration of 141,000 Mg of carbon in remaining wetlands in the Tampa Bay watershed.

TI  - Global controls on carbon storage in mangrove soils
AB  - Global-scale variation in mangrove ecosystem properties has been explained using a conceptual framework linking geomorphological processes to distinct coastal environmental settings (CES) for nearly 50 years. However, these assumptions have not been empirically tested at the global scale. Here, we show that CES account for global variability in mangrove soil C:N:P stoichiometry and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. Using this ecogeomorphology framework, we developed a global model that captures variation in mangrove SOC stocks compatible with distinct CES. We show that mangrove SOC stocks have been underestimated by up to 50\% (a difference of roughly 200 Mg ha(-1)) in carbonate settings and overestimated by up to 86\% (around 400 Mg ha(-1)) in deltaic coastlines. Moreover, we provide information for 57 nations that currently lack SOC data, enabling these and other countries to develop or evaluate their blue carbon inventories.

TI  - SPECIES DIVERSITY, BIOMASS, AND CARBON STOCK ASSESSMENTS OF A NATURAL MANGROVE FOREST IN PALAWAN, PHILIPPINES
AB  - Philippines claims international recognition for its mangrove-rich ecosystem which play significant functions from the viewpoint of ecosystem services and climate change mitigation. In this study, we assessed the species diversity of the natural mangrove forest of Bahile, Puerto Princesa City, Palawan and evaluated its potential to sequester and store carbon. Sixteen plots with a size of 10 m x 10 m were established using quadrat sampling technique to identify, record, and measure the trees. Diversity index and allometric equations were utilized to determine species diversity, and biomass and carbon stocks. Sediment samples in undisturbed portions using a 30 cm high and 5 cm diameter corer were collected in all plots to determine near-surface sediment carbon. The diversity index (H' = 0.9918) was very low having a total of five true mangrove species identified dominated by Rhizophora apiculata Bl. with an importance value index of 148.1\%. Among the stands, 74\% of the total biomass was attributed to the above-ground (561.2 t ha(-1)) while 26\% was credited to the roots (196.5 t ha(-1)). The total carbon sequestered and stored in the above-ground and root biomass were 263.8 t C ha(-1) (50\%) and 92.3 t C ha(-1) (17\%), respectively. Sediments contained 33\% (173.75 t C ha(-1)) of the mangrove C-stocks. Stored carbon was equivalent to 1944.5 t CO2 ha(-1). These values suggest that Bahile natural mangrove forest has a potential to sequester and store substantial amounts of atmospheric carbon, hence the need for sustainable management and protection of this important coastal ecosystem.

TI  - Seagrass ecosystems: Contributions to and mechanisms of carbon sequestration
AB  - The ocean's vegetated habitats, in particular seagrasses, mangroves and salt marshes, each capture and store a comparable amount of carbon per year, forming the Earth's blue carbon sinks, the most intense carbon sinks on the planet. Seagrass meadows, characterized by high prima-ry productivity, efficient water column filtration and sediment stability, have a pronounced capacity for carbon sequestration. This is enhanced by low decomposition rates in anaerobic seagrass sediments. The carbon captured by seagrass meadows contributes significantly to the total blue carbon. At a global scale, seagrass ecosystems are carbon sink hot spots and have profound influences on the global carbon cycle. This importance combined with the many other functions of seagrass meadows places them among the most valuable ecosystems in the world. Unfortunately, seagrasses are declining globally at an alarming rate owing to anthropogenic disturbances and climate change, making them also among the most threatened ecosystems on the Earth. The role of coastal systems in carbon sequestration has received far too little attention and thus there are still many uncertainties in evaluating carbon sequestration of global seagrass meadows accurately. To better assess the carbon sequestration of global seagrass ecosystems, a number of scientific issues should be considered with high priorities: 1) more accurate measurements of seagrass coverage at national and global levels; 2) more comprehensive research into species-and location-specific carbon sequestration efficiencies; 3) in-depth exploration of the effects of human disturbance and global climate change on car-bon capture and storage by seagrass ecosystems.

TI  - Fine identification and biomass estimation of mangroves based on UAV multispectral and LiDAR [æ— äººæœºå¤šå…‰è°±å’ŒLiDARçš„çº¢æ ‘æž—ç²¾ç»†è¯†åˆ«ä¸Žç”Ÿç‰©é‡ä¼°ç®—]
AB  - Mangroves are special types of woody plants that grow exclusively in the intertidal zones of the tropics and the subtropics. With respect to environmental and ecological values, mangroves protect the shoreline from tides, winds, and storms and act as the first line of defense against extreme weather in coastal areas. Moreover, mangroves have a continuous carbon fixation capacity, which is much higher than those of peat swamp and coastal salt marsh. Mangroves are an important part of the earth carbon cycle system and considered an important blue carbon sink on the sea and land margin. However, mangrove habitat is threatened all over the world due to human development and utilization activities. Therefore, monitoring the spatial distribution of mangrove types and biomass will help guide policy-makers in taking effective utilization and protection measures. In this paper, on the basis of UAV multispectral images and LiDAR point cloud data, the support vector machine classification method is used for mangrove identification. Furthermore, mangrove species are distinguished according to different heights and distribution areas using the elevation information in the UAV LiDAR point cloud data. The structure characteristics of mangrove single wood are extracted by the point-cloud-based cluster segmentation method, and an estimation model of the tree height, canopy, and aboveground biomass obtained by LiDAR remote sensing is constructed, Finally, the aboveground biomass of mangrove in the study area is calculated, and its spatial distribution information is analyzed. The classification result of the species types of mangroves, which is combined with the multi spectrum and LiDAR point cloud data, can reach 90.69% in total accuracy. The kappa coefficient is 0.88. The accuracies of the algorithm in identifying single trees of Kandelia candel and Aegiceras corniculata are 86.71% and 60.21%, respectively. Among them, the middle errors of the heights of K. candel and A. corniculata are 0.36 and 0.18 m, respectively, and the crown width extraction precision of K. candel is higher than that of A. corniculata. The regression models of the aboveground biomass of K. candel and A. corniculata are constructed. The accuracy of the fusion model is the highest, and the respective decision coefficients (RÂ²) are 0.678 and 0.832 for K. candel and A. corniculata. Mangroves are mostly planted artificially in the study area and distributed in a belt perpendicular to the dam: K. candelâ€”Cyperus malaccensis Lam. and Acanthus ilicifolius L. â€”A. corniculata. The area of A. corniculata is the largest, which is approximately 8.91 hm2 and distributed on both sides of the tidal ditch far from the dam. The area of K. candel is 4.69 hm2, which is distributed in the area near the dam. C. malaccensis Lam. and A. ilicifolius L. are scattered in small areas among the different types of objects. The aboveground biomass of mangrove is calculated by the estimation model of above ground biomass. The aboveground biomass follows the order Sonneratia apetala &gt; A. corniculata &gt; C. malaccensis Lam. &gt; K. candel &gt; A. ilicifolius L.

TI  - Species Diversity, Biomass and Carbon Stock Assessment of Kanhlyashay Natural Mangrove Forest
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems sequester and store large amounts of carbon in both biomass and soil. In this study, species diversity, the above and below-ground biomass as well as carbon stock by the mangroves in Kanhlyashay natural mangrove forest were estimated. Six true mangrove species from four families were recorded in the sample plots of the study area. Among them, Avicennia officinalis L. from the Acanthaceae family was the abundance of species with an importance value of 218.69%. Shannonâ€“Wienerâ€™s diversity index value (Hâ€² = 0.71) of the mangrove community was very low compared to other natural mangrove forests since the mangrove stands in the study site possessed a low number of mangrove species and were dominated by a few species. Estimated mean biomass was 335.55 Â± 181.41 Mg haâˆ’1 (AGB = 241.37 Â± 132.73 Mg haâˆ’1, BGB = 94.17 Â± 48.73 Mg haâˆ’1). The mean overall C-stock of the mangrove stand was 150.25 Â± 81.35 Mg C haâˆ’1 and is equivalent to 551.10 Â± 298.64 Mg CO2 eq. The role of forests in climate change is two-fold as a cause and a solution for greenhouse gas emissions. The result of the study demonstrated that the mangroves in Letkhutkon village have high carbon storage potential, therefore it is necessary to be sustainably managed to maintain and increase carbon storage. Climate change mitigation may be achieved not only by reducing the carbon emission levels but also by maintaining the mangrove ecosystem services as carbon sinks and sequestration.

TI  - Sediment, carbon and vegetation dynamics in an estuarine wetland of the Hunter estuary, NSW
AB  - In the Hunter estuary of NSW, as in most of south eastern Australia, estuarine wetlands typically comprise intertidal mudflats at the seaward margin, followed up the topographic gradient by dense mangrove forest, with saltmarsh plains landwards of these mangroves stands. Both saltmarsh and mangrove forest are important carbon sinks, and provide unique habitats for fish and many terrestrial species. Saltmarsh is particularly critical as roosting habitat for shorebirds, and a decline in saltmarsh habitat, in part due to mangrove encroachment associated with changing estuary water levels, has been observed in the estuary. The present research aimed at establishing the effects of flow manipulation in Area E of Kooragang Island, an important roosting site that has been subject to tidal reinstatement in 1995. We analysed accretion rates, carbon capture and vegetation distribution evolution as a result of these changes in order to support ongoing restoration efforts on the site. The methodology consisted of a combination of field data collection, laboratory experiments, statistical analysis and numerical hydrodynamic simulation. Results show that tidal reinstatement resulted in general increased accretion and carbon sequestration rates, and a continuous encroachment of mangrove into saltmarsh areas. Based on these results, a mangrove exclusion program through tidal hydraulic manipulation at the wetland inlet has been proposed. Â© 2012 Engineers Australia.

TI  - Sediment transport and carbon sequestration characteristics along mangrove fringed coasts
AB  - Mangroves play an important role in sequestering carbon and trapping sediments. However, the effectiveness of such functions is unclear due to the restriction of knowledge on the sedimentation process across the vegetation boundaries. To detect the effects of mangrove forests on sediment transportation and organic carbon sequestration, the granulometric and organic carbon characteristics of mangrove sediments were investigated from three vegetation zones of four typical mangrove habitats on the Leizhou Peninsula coast. Based on our results, sediment transport was often ``environmentally sensitive{''} to the vegetation friction. A transition of the sediment transport mode from the mudflat zone to the interior/fringe zone was often detected from the cumulative frequency curve. The vegetation cover also assists the trapping of material, resulting in a significantly higher concentration of organic carbon in the interior surface sediments. However, the graphic parameters of core sediments reflected a highly temporal variability due to the sedimentation process at different locations. The sediment texture ranges widely from sand to mud, although the sedimentary environments are restricted within the same energy level along the fluvial-marine transition zone. Based on the PCA results, the large variation was mainly attributed to either the mean grain size features or the organic carbon features. A high correlation between the depth and delta C-13 value also indicated an increasing storage of mangrove-derived organic carbon with time.

TI  - Allochthonous and autochthonous contributions to carbon accumulation and carbon store in southeastern Australian coastal wetlands
AB  - Estimates of carbon store and carbon accumulation rate in mangrove and saltmarsh are beset by issues of scale and provenance. Estimates at a site do not allow scaling to regional estimates if the drivers of variability are not known. Also, carbon accumulation within soils provides a net offset only if carbon is derived in-situ, or would not otherwise be sequestered. We use a network of observation sites extending across 2000km of southeastern Australian coastline to determine the influence of geomorphic setting and coastal wetland vegetation type on rates of carbon accumulation, carbon store and probable sources. Carbon accumulation above feldspar marker horizons over a 10-year period was driven primarily by tidal range and position in the tidal frame, and was higher for mangrove and saltmarsh dominated by Juncus kraussii than for other saltmarsh communities. The rate of carbon loss with depth varied between geomorphic settings and was the primary determinant of carbon store. A down-core enrichment in Î´13C was consistent with an increased relative contribution of mangrove root material to soil carbon, as mangrove roots were found to be consistently enriched compared to leaves. We conclude that while surface carbon accumulation is driven primarily by tidal transport of allocthonous sediment, in-situ carbon sequestration is the dominant source of recalcitrant carbon, and that mangrove and saltmarsh carbon accumulation and store is high in temperate settings, particularly in mesotidal and fluvial geomorphic settings.

TI  - Costâ€“benefit analysis of â€˜Blue Carbonâ€™ sequestration by plantation of few key mangrove species at Sundarban Biosphere Reserve, India
AB  - Climate change and global warming have a destabilizing effect on the global environment, and governmental statutory bodies are emphasizing a reduction of emission coupled with restoration of degraded forest lands as a carbon sequestrationâ€“emission reduction (REDD+) initiative. Asphyxiated mangrove soil, existing on the borderline of land and sea, has the highest potential to trap â€˜blue carbonâ€™; hence, plantation programs have been initiated around the tropical coasts to restore this unique habitat. This case study provides a costâ€“benefit and carbon sequestration analysis for planting of five mangrove species (Avicennia marina, Bruguiera sexangula, Ceriops tagal, Rhizophora mucronata and Xylocarpus moluccensis) by various methods in a 102.4-ha area at the Indian Sundarbans. It is estimated that as per the planting methods used in the current study and physio-chemical properties of the sediment, coupled with other local factors such as anthropogenic interventions, Avicennia marina planting by the â€˜propagule dibblingâ€™ method is the most cost effective (0.002 Euro/survived plant), with the highest increment (97%) in organic carbon density (OCD), humic acid (100.86%) and fulvic acid (48.78%) over a period of 5 years. Survival rate was highest (82%) for Avicennia marina, planted by the â€˜transplanting of nursery-grown seedlingsâ€™ method. The drain and trench method resulted in a 55% survival rate for Rhizophora mucronata, but the extra labor investment made this the costliest method (0.13 Euro/survived plant) and also less carbon effective (only 85% increment of OCD in 5 years). Planting methods, sediment quality, tidal inundation and salinity variations can play a major role in blue carbon burial/sequestration in mangrove lands.

TI  - Mapping of blue carbon ecosystems: Effect of proximity, activity types and frequency of visits in the accuracy of participatory maps
AB  - Interest in blue carbon has drastically increased in recent years, particularly in improving the coastal resource carbon storage estimates and the development of methodology for identifying and monitoring such resources. In coastal resource mapping, participatory mapping techniques have the potential to provide a level of granularity and detail by taking advantage of local knowledge. In this work, we aim to evaluate the agreement between blue carbon ecosystem status obtained from participatory mapping versus the ones discriminated from satellite images, as well as assess how â€œrelative proximityâ€ to landmarks affects the accuracy. Results showed that the accuracy of mapped mangrove extents, evaluated as intersection-over-union, is positively correlated with frequency of visits. It is also found that maps generated by participants who have jobs or activities that nurture awareness about mangroves and seagrasses tend to agree better with remotely-sensed maps. The participants were even able to identify small patches of mangroves and seagrasses that are not present in the classified satellite images. While our initial work explores factors that impact the consistency between these sources, there is a need to establish a baseline for which both sources of information are evaluated against; and define relevant accuracy metrics. Our final goal is to systematically combine these two sources of information for an accurate holistic coastal resource map. Â© Authors 2019. CC BY 4.0 License.

TI  - Organic carbon isotope and pollen evidence for mangrove development and response to human activity in Guangxi (Southwest China) over the last 140 years
AB  - Mangrove degradation must reduce carbon sequestration in recent years, thereby aggravating global warming. Thus, short-term impacts of human activity on mangrove ecosystems are cause for concern from local governments and scientists. Mangroves sediments can provide detailed records of mangrove species variation in the last one hundred years, based on detailed 210Pb data. The study traced the history of mangrove development and its response to environmental change over the last 140 years in two mangrove swamps of Guangxi, Southwest China. Average sedimentation rates were calculated to be 0.48 cm/a and 0.56 cm/a in the Yingluo Bay and the Maowei Sea, respectively. Chemical indicators (delta 13C(org) and C:N) were utilized to trace the contribution of mangrove-derived organic matter (MOM) using a ternary mixing model. Simultaneous use of mangrove pollen can help to supplement some of these limitations in diagenetic/overlap of isotopic signatures. We found that vertical distribution of MOM was consistent with mangrove pollen, which could provide similar information for tracing mangrove ecosystems. Therefore, mangrove development was reconstructed and divided into three stages: flourishing, degradation and re-flourishing/re-degradation period. The significant degradation, found in the period of 1968-1998 and 1907-2007 in the Yingluo Bay and the Maowei Sea, respectively, corresponding to a rapid increase of reclamation area and seawall length, rather than climate change as recorded in the region.

TI  - Assessment of blue carbon storage by baja California (Mexico) tidal wetlands and evidence for wetland stability in the face of anthropogenic and climatic impacts
AB  - Although saline tidal wetlands cover less than a fraction of one percent of the earthâ€™s surface (~0.01%), they efficiently sequester organic carbon due to high rates of primary production coupled with surfaces that aggrade in response to sea level rise. Here, we report on multi-decadal changes (1972-2008) in the extent of tidal marshes and mangroves, and characterize soil carbon density and source, for five regions of tidal wetlands located on Baja Californiaâ€™s Pacific coast. Land-cover change analysis indicates the stability of tidal wetlands relative to anthropogenic and climate change impacts over the past four decades, with most changes resulting from natural coastal processes that are unique to arid environments. The disturbance of wetland soils in this region (to a depth of 50 cm) would liberate 2.55 Tg of organic carbon (C) or 9.36 Tg CO2eq. Based on stoichiometry and carbon stable isotope ratios, the source of organic carbon in these wetland sediments is derived from a combination of wetland macrophyte, algal, and phytoplankton sources. The reconstruction of natural wetland dynamics in Baja California provides a counterpoint to the history of wetland destruction elsewhere in North America, and measurements provide new insights on the control of carbon sequestration in arid wetlands.

TI  - Wetlands and carbon revisited
AB  - This paper summarizes 19 papers published in a special issue of Ecological Engineering under the general banner of wetlands and carbon. Many of the papers were presented at a special session at EcoSummit 2016 in Montpellier, France in August-September 2016. The papers are in four general categories: estimating greenhouse gas fluxes with eddy covariance; methane and other greenhouse gas emissions from wetlands; carbon sequestration by wetlands; and organic carbon decomposition in wetlands. Overall, we found that further development and wider use of eddy covariance measuring stations could help clarify long-term annual budgets of CO2 and CH4 in wetlands and, while CH4 fluxes in some coastal wetlands such as mangroves can be negligible, some inland wetlands can be significant sources of CH4 where hydroperiods are the major determinants of the emission rates. The papers here demonstrated a variety of parameters determining dynamics of methane fluxes and carbon sequestration in different wetlands and lead us to suggest that more attention should be paid to detailed analysis of the impact of environmental and management factors on carbon budgets in wetlands. Carbon sequestration is almost always estimated by soil dating methods such as with 137Cs and 210Pb isotopes and results continue to show order of magnitude differences among systems but sometimes among laboratories. This is due to the inexact nature of estimating soil dates over relatively short (âˆ¼50 year) time horizons. The idea of capping landfills, which are enormous methane sources, with wetlands which could then turn them into carbon sinks is worth investigating further but the design of these systems is still in its infancy. Organic carbon decomposition in wetlands has been investigated extensively for decades and more recently on the biogeochemical processes. â€˜Enzymic latchesâ€ such as phenol oxidase, which can break down phenolics and therefore speed up decomposition, may be key controllers of organic matter decomposition in waterlogged and submerged soils in wetlands. The best approach for balancing greenhouse gases and carbon sequestration remains an enigma, but the papers in this special issue take us one step closer to providing clarity. Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Carbon stocks and soil sequestration rates of tropical riverine wetlands
AB  - Riverine wetlands are created and transformed by geomorphological processes that determine their vegetation composition, primary production and soil accretion, all of which are likely to influence C stocks. Here, we compared ecosystem C stocks (trees, soil and downed wood) and soil N stocks of different types of riverine wetlands (marsh, peat swamp forest and mangroves) whose distribution spans from an environment dominated by river forces to an estuarine environment dominated by coastal processes. We also estimated soil C sequestration rates of mangroves on the basis of soil C accumulation. We predicted that C stocks in mangroves and peat swamps would be larger than marshes, and that C, N stocks and C sequestration rates would be larger in the upper compared to the lower estuary. Mean C stocks in mangroves and peat swamps (784.5 +/- 73.5 and 722.2 +/- 63.6 MgC ha(-1), respectively) were higher than those of marshes (336.5 +/- 38.3 MgC ha(-1)). Soil C and N stocks of mangroves were highest in the upper estuary and decreased towards the lower estuary. C stock variability within mangroves was much lower in the upper estuary (range 744-912 MgC ha(-1)) compared to the intermediate and lower estuary (range 537-1115 MgC ha(-1)) probably as a result of a highly dynamic coastline. Soil C sequestration values were 1.3 +/- 0.2 MgC ha(-1) yr(-1) and were similar across sites. Estimations of C stocks within large areas need to include spatial variability related to vegetation composition and geomorphological setting to accurately reflect variability within riverine wetlands.

TI  - Estimating mangrove above-ground biomass at Maowei Sea, Beibu Gulf of China using machine learning algorithm with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems such as mangroves are natural barriers to resisting and alleviating the impact of storm surges and extreme catastrophic weather. Accurate and efficient determination of the aboveground biomass of mangroves is of great importance for the protection and restoration of blue carbon ecosystems and their response to climate change. This study proposes a light gradient boosting model (LGBM) based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for feature selection. We constructed and verified the proposed model using 227 quadrat datasets from a field survey and Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. The determination coefficient (R-2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were used to evaluate the performance of the model. Compared with random forest(RF), K-nearest neighbourhood regression(KNNR), extreme gradient boosting(XGBR), LGBM, and other machine learning algorithms, the LGBM-PSO model achieves better results (R-2 = 0.7807, RMSE = 24.6864 Mg center dot ha(-1)), The predicted range of mangrove biomass is 4.623-206.975 Mg center dot ha(-1). Therefore, the use of multisource remote sensing data combined with the LGBM-PSO model can provide better prediction results of aboveground biomass of mangroves, thereby providing a new method for estimating the aboveground biomass of large-scale mangroves.

TI  - Indonesia Provincial Spatial Plans on mangroves in era of decentralization: Application of content analysis to 27 provinces and ?blue carbon? as overlooked components
AB  - The salience of mangroves as carbon sinks are being increasingly recognized in terms of ?blue carbon.? Their significance at provincial level is critical in the era of decentralization after the reformation period. This study applied a content analysis to 27 Provincial Spatial Plans in Indonesia. The results were categorized into nine clusters. The findings indicated that the cluster prohibited activity was the most frequently mentioned in the context of management and utilization across provinces. This was followed by mangrove?s potential to be utilized as tourism and educational sites, while the aspect of ?blue carbon? was largely overlooked. The results indicated the usefulness of Provincial Spatial Plans as a benchmark for the priorities and awareness of lower-level governments concerning mangroves.

TI  - Fine-scale spatial variability in organic carbon in a temperate mangrove forest: Implications for estimating carbon stocks in blue carbon ecosystems
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems have the potential to store large amounts of carbon but detailed studies on the fine scale spatial variability of biomass components and sediment organic carbon (SOC) and their relationships are lacking. Here we investigated the fine-scale spatial variation of SOC, aboveground and belowground biomass using systematic grid sampling in a temperate Avicennia marina ((Forssk.) Vierh) forest in Australia. We estimated aboveground biomass in a 9 x 9 sampling grid within a 0.16 ha plot and measured SOC, fine root biomass and necromass down to 1 m at 81 sampling points in an A. marina forest in Western Port Bay near Melbourne, Australia. We detected large differences in all measured carbon pools. SOC increased from low to high intertidal position but showed no consistent trend with depth. Aboveground biomass carbon was highly variable (mean 84 +/- 56 Mg C ha(-1)), and showed no consistent trends with intertidal position. The average total organic carbon stock at the study site was 207 +/- 80 Mg C ha(-1). Aboveground biomass contributed 41\% and coarse roots around 6\% to the total carbon content of the forest. The bulk of organic carbon in the ecosystem was SOC (53\%) and necromass was an important contributor to SOC. Aboveground biomass was a poor predictor of all belowground carbon pools. Our data indicate that 43 sediment cores would be required to determine mean SOC content at the level required by international carbon accounting standards. The high spatial variability of all carbon stocks in the system indicates that current sampling strategies for SOC need to be revised in order to improve predictions of the amount of carbon stored in blue carbon ecosystems.

TI  - Interspecific variations in leaf litter decomposition and nutrient release from tropical mangroves
AB  - Efficient nutrient cycling through decomposition of leaf litter often regulates the high productivity and subsequent carbon sequestration of mangrove ecosystems along the land-ocean boundary. To understand the characteristics and the potentials of mangrove leaf litter in supplying organic carbon and nutrients to the coastal waters, four major mangrove species (A. officinalis, R. mucronata, H. littoralis and S. apetala) of Bhitarkanika mangrove forest, Odisha, India, were examined in controlled environmental conditions. Half-life time (t0.5), estimated for decomposition of those mangrove leaf litter materials ranged from 18 to 52 days. During the incubation experiment, organic carbon from mangrove leaf litter was released primarily through physical processes and was available for heterotrophic respiration. Among the four species, leaf litter of S. apetala with the lowest initial C/N ratios, released organic carbon with low molecular weight (labile substances) that has a relatively higher potential to support the aquatic food web. On the contrary, leaf litter of R. mucronata released organic material with relatively higher molecular weight (humic substances, higher aromaticity), which revealed its superior non-labile characteristics in this unique environment. The mean total heterotrophic bacterial (THB) population in the incubation was around nine-fold higher than the control. THB population growth and Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) spectral data further suggested the rapid release of highly labile and recalcitrant carbon from S. apetala and R. mucronata (between 7th and 21st day of incubation), respectively. The mean litter fall from the Bhitarkanika mangrove forest was estimated to be 11.32 Â± 1.57 Mg haâˆ’1 yâˆ’1 and its corresponding carbon content was 5.43 Â± 0.75 Mg C haâˆ’1. The study revealed the role of leaf litter leachates as an important food source to microbial communities in the adjacent coastal waters, in addition to a potential carbon sequesterer through long-term burial in mangrove soil and export to the deep sea.

TI  - Hypersaline tidal flats as important ``blue carbon{''} systems: a case study from three ecosystems
AB  - Hypersaline tidal flats (HTFs) are coastal ecosystems with freshwater deficits often occurring in arid or semiarid regions near mangrove supratidal zones with no major fluvial contributions. Here, we estimate that organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were buried at rates averaging 21 (+/- 6), 1.7 (+/- 0.3) and 1.4 (+/- 0.3) gm(-2) yr(-1), respectively, during the previous century in three contrasting HTF systems, one in Brazil (eutrophic) and two in Australia (oligotrophic). Although these rates are lower than those from nearby mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass systems, the importance of HTFs as sinks for OC, TN and TP may be significant given their extensive coverage. Despite the measured short-term variability between net air-saltpan CO2 influx and emission estimates found during the dry and wet season in the Brazilian HTF, the only site with seasonal CO2 flux measurements, the OC sedimentary profiles over several decades suggest efficient OC burial at all sites. Indeed, the stable isotopes of OC and TN (delta C-13 and delta N-1(5)) along with C : N ratios show that microphytobenthos are the major source of the buried OC in these HTFs. Our findings highlight a previously unquantified carbon as well as a nutrient sink and suggest that coastal HTF ecosystems could be included in the emerging blue carbon framework.

TI  - Relationships between above- and below-ground carbon stocks in mangrove forests facilitate better estimation of total mangrove blue carbon
AB  - Background Although great efforts have been made to quantify mangrove carbon stocks, accurate estimations of below-ground carbon stocks remain unreliable. In this study, we examined the distribution patterns of mangrove carbon stocks in China and other countries using our own field survey data and datasets from published literature. Based on these data, we investigated the possible relationships between above-ground carbon stock (AGC) and below-ground carbon stock (BGC) for mangrove forests, aiming to provide a scientific basis for estimation of total mangrove carbon stocks. Results The average above-ground carbon stock in each region was sizeable (ranging from 12.0 to 150.2 Mg/ha), but average below-ground carbon stock was dominant (ranging from 46.6 to 388.6 Mg/ha), accounting for 69-91\% of total carbon stock at the sites studied in China. Significant positive relationships were found between above-ground and below-ground mangrove carbon stocks, with the best fitting equation as BGC = 1.58 {*} AGC + 81.06 (Mg/ha, R-2 = 0.62, p < 0.01, n = 122) for China. Such linear relationships vary for mangrove forests of different types and locations, from different geographical regions in China to other countries worldwide. Conclusion The positive relationship we found between above- and below-ground carbon stocks of mangrove forests in China and worldwide can facilitate more accurate assessments of mangrove blue carbon stocks at regional or global scales using modern techniques including remote sensing.

TI  - A blueprint for blue carbon: toward an improved understanding of the role of vegetated coastal habitats in sequestering CO2
AB  - Recent research has highlighted the valuable role that coastal and marine ecosystems play in sequestering carbon dioxide (CO2). The carbon (C) sequestered in vegetated coastal ecosystems, specifically mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and salt marshes, has been termed ``blue carbon{''}. Although their global area is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than that of terrestrial forests, the contribution of vegetated coastal habitats per unit area to long-term C sequestration is much greater, in part because of their efficiency in trapping suspended matter and associated organic C during tidal inundation. Despite the value of mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and salt marshes in sequestering C, and the other goods and services they provide, these systems are being lost at critical rates and action is urgently needed to prevent further degradation and loss. Recognition of the C sequestration value of vegetated coastal ecosystems provides a strong argument for their protection and restoration; however, it is necessary to improve scientific understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control C sequestration in these ecosystems. Here, we identify key areas of uncertainty and specific actions needed to address them.

TI  - Blue Carbon: Comparison of Chronosequences from Avicennia marina Plantation and Proteresia coarctata Dominated Mudflat, at the World's Largest Mangrove Wetland
AB  - Sundarban is the world's largest contiguous mangrove forest but is under threat from anthropogenic interventions. Plantations are the favored method to restore degraded mudflats. In this study, ecological functional soil indicators (available N, soil organic C, available P, salinity) and service (Blue carbon pool) of the iteroparous tree Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh. (Acanthaceae family), plantation has been compared with a natural mudflat dominated by mangrove semelparous grass Proteresia coarctata (Roxb.) Tateoka (Poacease family). Both sites were under anthropogenic pressure. It was observed that the P. coarctata dominated natural site has gone through fluctuations in species population between 2012 and 2016 with higher Simpson's dominance, and lower value of the Shannon-Weiner Index. A one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), indicated that soil indicators have significantly varied and linearly increased across the years at the A. marina plantation site. Blue carbon pool increased by four times (10 cm soil depth) at the plantation site since 2012 compared to only one time in the mangrove grass dominated community within the study period (2012-2016). This study concludes that plantation with iteroparous mangrove species can improve ecosystem function and services at degraded mudflats dominated by semelparous grass and aid in achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 13 (Climate action).

TI  - Mangrove carbon assessment tool: Model validation and assessment of mangroves in southern USA and Mexico
AB  - While mangroves are widely recognized as a significant carbon (C) reservoir and the valued ecosystem services are inextricably linked to the C stocks and fluxes. Modeling tools haven't been available to simulate C dynamics in mangroves to inform assessments, Monitoring, Reporting and Verification for REDD+, or management and restoration prescriptions. The process-based model MCAT-DNDC (Mangrove-Carbon-Assessment-Tool-DeNitrification-DeComposition) was validated using measurements from sites in Quintana Roo, Mexico and Florida, USA. The validated model was then applied to model C sequestration in mangroves sites in Texas, Louisiana and Florida that had measured data for comparison. The model validation against aboveground biomass (AGB) showed that the simulation provided good agreement with observations with a proper slope (1.06) and small intercept (1.32 Mg haâˆ’1, about 1.4% of observed mean); the model performance efficiency for assessing AGB was high (R2 = 0.99). Among ten C pools and fluxes validated using data from the Everglades National Park, eight components were in good agreement with the observations, and two were within the range of observation; demonstrating effective model performance (R2 &gt; 0.95). The metrics from the model validation showed that MCAT-DNDC can be used to estimate C sequestration in mangroves within the coastal areas along Gulf of Mexico and Mexican Caribbean with good model performance. Simulated C dynamics for plots in Texas, Louisiana and Florida showed that the relationship between above-ground biomass and stand age was non-linear, and that gross and net primary productivity increased logarithmically with stand age. The differences in C components among the sites exhibited the effects of ecological drivers on C sequestration in mangroves. Simulations also demonstrated that the model may be useful in considering the effect of forest management on C sequestration. The model appears to be stable and sufficiently robust to warrant further testing with additional data and across a variety of sites. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Estimating aboveground biomass and carbon stocks of mangrove forests in Kuala Sepetang, Perak
AB  - Tree biomass estimates and analyses are essential for carbon accounting and other feasibility studies including bioenergy. Forest including mangrove trees play an important role in ecosystems which could be addressing climate change and mitigation through biomass and carbon storage. A reasonable method for estimating tree biomass and carbon stocks are increasingly important due to concerns on global climate change and carbon sequestration. This study aims to estimate the aboveground biomass (AGB) of a mangrove trees in Kuala Sepetang using allometric model. A total of 16 compartments of mangrove were used to sample a 150 plots. Biomass and carbon stock by each plot and compartment were estimated. It was found that the average AGB for all sample plots were 168.93 t ha-1. The maximum value was 462.40 t ha-1 while the minimum value was 24.35 t ha-1 and a total AGB of the study plots was about 2,533.98 tonnes. The total value for carbon stock in 150 plots was 12,669.90 tC ha-1 while the average was 84.47 tC ha-1. The estimation of ABG was 1.8% more when compared to previous study by using destructive method. Thus, the allometric method is practical to estimate AGB. The advantage of the allometric method is the operation is simple at low cost. This method also could be done in a short of time and most accurate in forest plantations where trees are relatively uniform. Â© 2018 Forestry Department of Peninsular Malaysia. All rights reserved.

AB  - To explore the carbon storage of Sonneratia apetala in Guangdong Province, provide basic data for carbon sequestration investigation and monitoring based on mangrove biomass in Guangdong Province, and provide experiences and methods for monitoring mangrove carbon sequestration in China. S. apetala vegetation and 0-100 cm soil were taken as research objects to build biomass model that could be universally used in Guangdong Province, and compare carbon storage of vegetation and soil in ten regions. The biomass model of S. apetala was W=0.033(D2H)1.002, and the determination coefficient was 0.952. The fitting effect of the model was good. Total area of S. apetala forest in Guangdong Province was 1 724.12 hm2, total carbon storage was 536 801.09 t, vegetation carbon density was 50.81 tâ€¢hm-2, soil carbon density was 260.54 tâ€¢hm-2 and total carbon density was 311.35 tâ€¢hm-2. Vegetation carbon density was 16.32% of total carbon density, and soil carbon density was 83.68% of total carbon density. Total carbon reserves of S. apetala forest in ten regions were performed in the order of Shenzhen 2 790.65 t &lt; Chaozhou 3 088.34 t &lt; Huizhou 10 479.30 t &lt; Jiangmen 13 800.58 t &lt; Maoming 17 116.43 t &lt; Zhanjiang 55 610.15 t &lt; Zhongshan 58 562.90 t &lt; Shantou 66 498.62 t &lt; Guangzhou 134 938.18 t &lt; Zhuhai 173 915.93 t. Carbon storage of S. apetala in Guangdong Province is mainly concentrated in soil layer. Soil carbon storage and vegetation carbon storage of S. apetala are obviously different in different regions.

TI  - Modelling above ground biomass accumulation of mangrove plantations in Vietnam
AB  - In many tropical nations, mangrove forests are essential ecosystems for climate change mitigation and adaptation in coastal regions as they provide important forest resources as well as a suite of other benefits to communities including carbon sequestration. Empirical growth and yield modelling methods derived from terrestrial forestry, which are often robust with respect to forestry forecasting and management, have not often been assessed in mangrove forests yet they are important for underpinning sustainable forest management. We surveyed 89 Rhizophora apiculata mangrove plantations with age ranges from 4 to 26 year old in Vietnam, destructively harvesting 25 trees for biomass measurements and 70 for stem analyses, to assess increments in biomass and standing timber. Systems of equations were developed to model site index, mean diameter, dominant height, stocking, biomass and timber volume. We found that conventional forest growth modelling methods fitted the observed data well. Similar to terrestrial forests, stand height is a good indicator of site productivity. Mean errors for stand volume and biomass estimated from yield tables were both less than 5.3%. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the biomass model was 12 and RMSE of the volume model was 10.8, suggesting that these methods are applicable to evenly aged monoculture mangrove plantations in Vietnam. Our research also indicated high variation in mean annual increment of biomass (MAI) in the surveyed plantations due to a wide range of age and site conditions. Some R. apiculata plantations in Vietnam can reach a peak aboveground biomass MAI of 22.7 Mg haâˆ’1 yearâˆ’1, which is among the highest of published values from plantations of the same species worldwide. Further studies addressing the application of terrestrial forest growth methods to mangrove systems are suggested in order to develop reliable and useful tools for sustainable management of this important ecosystem.

TI  - Blue carbon for reducing the impacts of climate change: An Indonesian case study
AB  - This article analyses the concept of blue carbon ecosystems, particularly mangrove swamps, in two international law contexts: climate change law and environmental law. Aspects of the two international law regimes relevant to blue carbon ecosystems are identified and discussed, and it is argued that blue carbon ecosystems can be included in climate change mitigation strategies. Despite the potential difficulties associated with doing this via climate change law and environmental law, utilising a combination of the two regimes may be a sensible approach. Using Indonesia as a case study, the article concludes by outlining the applicability and ongoing implementation of the concept in that country, which has more mangrove coverage than any other country in the world. Indonesia's ongoing endeavour to include blue carbon ecosystems in its climate change mitigation strategies is an innovative initiative.

TI  - Potential for Return on Investment in Rehabilitation-Oriented Blue Carbon Projects: Accounting Methodologies and Project Strategies
AB  - Opportunities to boost climate change mitigation and adaptation (CCMA) and sustainable conservation financing may lie in enhancing blue carbon sequestration, particularly in developing nations where coastal ecosystems are extensive and international carbon markets offer comparatively attractive payments for environmental stewardship. While blue carbon is receiving increased global attention, few credit-generating projects are operational, due to low credit-buyer incentives with uncertainty in creditable emissions reductions and high project costs. Little empirical guidance exists for practitioners to quantify return-on-investment (ROI) and viability of potential projects, particularly for rehabilitation where multiple implementation options exist with diverse associated costs. We map and model drivers of mangrove natural regeneration (NR) using remote sensing (high-resolution satellite imagery segmentation and time-series modeling), and subsequent carbon sequestration using field- and literature-derived data, across abandoned aquaculture ponds in the Philippines. Using project-specific cost data, we then assess ROI for a hypothetical rehabilitation-focused mangrove blue carbon project at a 9.68 ha abandoned pond over a 10-year timeframe, under varied rehabilitation scenarios {[}NR vs. assisted natural regeneration (ANR) with planting], potential emissions reduction accreditation methodologies, carbon prices and discount rates. NR was faster in lower-lying ponds with lower tidal exposure (greater pond dike retention). Forecasted carbon sequestration was 3.7- to 5.2-fold and areal ``greenbelt{''} regeneration 2.5- to 3.4-fold greater in our case study under ANR than NR. Variability in modeled sequestration rates drove high uncertainty and credit deductions in NR strategies. ROI with biomass-only accreditation was low and negative under NR and ANR, respectively. ROI was greater under ANR with inclusion of biomass and autochthonous soil carbon; however, neither strategy was highly profitable at current voluntary market carbon prices. ANR was the only scenario that fulfilled coastal protection greenbelt potential, with full mangrove cover within 10 years. Our findings highlight the benefits of ANR and soils inclusion in rehabilitation-oriented blue carbon projects, to maximize carbon sequestration and greenbelt enhancement (thus enhance pricing with potential bundled credits), and minimize forecasting uncertainty and credit-buyers' perceived risk. An ANR rehabilitation strategy in low-lying, sea-facing abandoned ponds with low biophysical intervention costs may represent large blue carbon CCMA opportunities in regions with high aquaculture abandonment.

TI  - National scale predictions of contemporary and future blue carbon storage
AB  - To help mitigate the impacts of climate change, many nature-based solutions are being explored. These solutions involve protection and restoration of ecosystems that serve as efficient carbon sinks, including vegetated coastal ecosystems (VCEs: tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows) also known as â€˜Blue Carbonâ€™ ecosystems. In fact, many nations are seeking to manage VCEs to help meet their climate change mitigation targets through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). However, incorporation of VCEs into NDCs requires national-scale estimates of contemporary and future blue carbon storage, which has not yet been achieved. Here we address this challenge using machine learning approaches to reliably map (with 62â€“72% accuracy) soil carbon stocks in VCEs based on geospatial data (topography, geomorphology, climate, and anthropogenic impacts), using Australia as a case study. The resulting maps of soil carbon stocks showed that there is a total of 951 Tg (Â±65 Tg) of carbon stock within Australian VCEs. Strong relationships between soil carbon stocks and climatic conditions (temperature, rainfall, solar radiation) allowed us to project future changes in carbon storage across all RCP scenarios for the years 2050 and 2090 to determine changes in environmental suitability for soil carbon stocks. Results show that soil carbon stocks in mangrove/tidal marsh ecosystems are likely to predominantly experience declines in carbon stocks under predicted climate change scenarios (19% of ecosystems area is predicted to have an increase in soil carbon stocks, while 38% of ecosystems area is predicted to have a decrease in soil carbon stocks), but a majority of seagrass area is likely to have increased soil carbon stocks (56% increase, 7% decrease). This approach is effective for developing robust national blue carbon inventories and revealing the capacity for blue carbon to help meet NDCs. The resulting spatially-explicit maps can also be used to pinpoint areas for successful blue carbon projects both now and in the future. Â© 2021

TI  - Primary evaluation of carbon sequestration potential of wetlands in China
AB  - As one of the important ecosystem services of wetlands, carbon sequestration potential of lakes and swamps in China were investigated. Significant differences were found among the carbon sequestration potential of various lakes, determined by natural conditions and human disturbance. In this study, swamps had a carbon sequestration potential of 4.90 TgC, much higher than lakes in China. Mangrove and coastal marsh have the highest carbon sediment rate among swamps. Carbon sequestration potential in returning farms to lakes and swamps was 30.26 and 0.22 GgC. ... a-1, respectively. Under the ongoing national wetland conservation action plan in China, the carbon sequestration potential of wetland restoration was 6.57 GgC. ... a-1.

TI  - Spatial complexities in aboveground carbon stocks of a semi-arid mangrove community: A remote sensing height-biomass-carbon approach
AB  - Mangroves are integral to ecosystem services provided by the coastal zone, in particular carbon (C) sequestration and storage. Allometric relationships linking mangrove height to estimated biomass and C stocks have been developed from field sampling, while various forms of remote sensing has been used to map vegetation height and biomass. Here we combine both these approaches to investigate spatial patterns in living biomass of mangrove forests in a small area of mangrove in north-west Australia. This study used LiDAR data and Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) with allometric equations to derive mangrove height, biomass, and C stock estimates. We estimated the study site, Mangrove Bay, a semiarid site in north-western Australia, contained 70 Mg ha(-1) biomass and 45 Mg C ha(-1) organic C, with total stocks of 2417 Mg biomass and 778 Mg organic C. Using spatial statistics to identify the scale of clustering of mangrove pixels, we found that living biomass and C stock declined with increasing distance from hydrological features (creek entrance: 0-150 m; y = -0.00041x + 0.9613, R-2 = 0.96; 150 -770 m; y = -0.0008x + 1.6808, R-2 = 0.73; lagoon: y = -0.0041x + 3.7943, R-2 = 0.78). Our results illustrate a set pattern of living C distribution within the mangrove forest, and then highlight the role hydrologic features play in determining C stock distribution in the arid zone.

TI  - Communities and blue carbon: the role of traditional management systems in providing benefits for carbon storage, biodiversity conservation and livelihoods
AB  - Blue carbon refers to the considerable amounts of carbon sequestered by mangroves, seagrass beds, tidal marshes and other coastal and marine vegetated ecosystems. At the present time, carbon market mechanisms to compensate those conserving blue carbon ecosystems, and thus reducing carbon emissions, are not yet in place. The ecosystem services provided by coastal vegetated ecosystems extend beyond their carbon storage capacity, and include their contribution to fishery production; shoreline protection; provision of habitat for wildlife and migratory species; flood water attenuation; nutrient cycling, pollution buffering; as well as their cultural, spiritual, subsistence and recreational uses. Because these services are of high economic, social and cultural value, the management and protection of blue carbon ecosystems could build collaboration between climate change and biodiversity practitioners on the national and international level. Such collaboration would also allow for the transfer of lessons learned from coastal management and conservation activities to carbon mitigation projects, and would include the need to work closely together with indigenous peoples and local communities. Resulting management activities on the local level could utilize and strengthen traditional knowledge and management systems related to blue carbon ecosystems, and increase both the resilience of biodiversity and that of coastal communities, as well as provide for long-term storage of blue carbon. While the challenge of scaling up local initiatives remains, some concrete examples already exist, such as the network of locally-managed marine areas (LMMAs) in the Pacific and beyond.

TI  - Atmospheric carbon removal capacity of a mangrove ecosystem in a micro-tidal basin estuary in Sri Lanka
AB  - Characterization of the micro-tidal mangrove forests in Negombo estuary, located on the west coast of Sri Lanka, with respect to its capacity to remove atmospheric carbon and sequestration in above and below ground plant components is the objective of this study. These mangroves constitute both natural stands (e.g. Kadolkele) and woodlots planted, protected and managed by fishermen (e.g. Wedikanda) to extract twigs and branches to construct "brush parks", a traditional method of fishing in this estuary. Both types of mangrove stands support high species richness and structural diversity, indicating planted mangrove areas have reached a semi-natural state. Allometric relationships were used to calculate biomass increment. Differences in litterfall, above and below ground biomass increment and net primary productivity (NPP) of the two types of mangrove areas were statistically insignificant, thus indicating that they are structurally and functionally comparable. Average rate of mangrove litterfall in Negombo estuary was 802 Â± 25 g m-2y-1. The average above ground biomass increment was 1213 Â± 95 gm-2y-1 and below ground increment was 267 Â± 18 gm-2y-1, thus the average NPP of these mangroves was 2282 Â± 125 g m-2y-1. NPP showed a decreasing trend from water towards land, in line with plant density and leaf area index. A statistically significant relationship was found between vegetation structure (represented by complexity index), NPP and rate of organic carbon accumulation in mangroves. Potential carbon accumulation capacity of mangroves of Negombo estuary was estimated to be approximately 12 t ha-1y-1, which is equivalent to the amount of carbon emitted as CO2 through combustion of 19,357 L of diesel or 22,212 L of gasoline in motor vehicles. Potential atmospheric carbon removal capacity of Negombo estuarine mangroves (350 ha in extent) therefore was estimated to be 4143 t y-1, which is equivalent to removal of CO2 emitted through combustion of 6,779,000 L of diesel or 7,779,000 L of gasoline within a year.

TI  - Crab bioturbation drives coupled iron-phosphate-sulfide cycling in mangrove and salt marsh soils
AB  - Coastal wetlands sequestering abundant blue carbon in soils are biogeochemical hotspots and critical habitats for benthic animals like invertebrate fiddler crabs. Here, we reveal how crab bioturbation (i.e., burrowing activity) drives the redox geochemistry of ferrous iron (Fe(II)), phosphate (PO43-), and sulfide (S(-II)) under contrasting vegetation types and hydrological conditions. We used in-situ approaches of diffusive gradients in thin films to perform detailed mm-scale burrow observations in two subtropical wetlands with a vegetation gradient of mudflat-salt marsh-mangrove. Burrow flushing caused a top-down hydrologic connectivity through the crab burrows and thus created a deep depth for the occurrence of Fe(III) reduction and sulfate reduction which were accompanied by P mobilization. The burrow oxidation zone, indicated by lower concentrations of Fe(II), PO43- and S(-II), were shallower in mudflats and salt marshes than in mangroves due to the unique respiratory roots of mangrove plants. The redox of Fe(II), PO(4)(3-)and S(-II) in crab burrow was insensitive to the convection flow induced input of dissolved oxygen through the surrounding soil matrix, indicating the burrow soil is an independent microenvironment. Crab burrowing activities favored Fe-S coupling which is conductive the formation of pyrite and alkalinity generation. Overall, our in-situ high-resolution observations and porewater hydraulic dynamics revealed spatially variable soil geochemistry, active coupled cycling of Fe-P-S in crab burrows, and mm-scale hotspots of redox cycling within burrows.

TI  - Opportunities and challenges for mangrove carbon sequestration in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam
AB  - Increasing value is attributed to mangroves due to their considerable capacity to sequester carbon, known as â€˜blue carbonâ€™. Assessments of opportunities and challenges associated with estimating the significance of carbon sequestered by mangroves need to consider a range of disciplinary perspectives, including the bio-physical science mangroves, social and economic issues of land use, local and international law, and the role of public and private finance. We undertook an interdisciplinary review based on available literature and fieldwork focused on parts of the Mekong River Delta (MRD). Preliminary estimates indicate mangrove biomass may be 70â€“150 t haâˆ’1, but considerably larger storage of carbon occurs in sediments beneath mangroves. These natural stores of carbon are compromised when mangroves are removed to accommodate anthropogenic activities. Mangroves are an important resource in the MRD that supplies multiple goods and services, and conservation or re-establishment of mangroves provides many benefits. International law and within-country environmental frameworks offer increasing scope to recognize the role that mangrove forests play through carbon sequestration, in order that these might lead to funding opportunities, both in public and private sectors. Such schemes need to have positive rather than negative impacts on the livelihoods of the many people living within and adjacent to these wetlands. Nevertheless, many challenges remain and it will require further targeted and coordinated scientific research, development of economic and social incentives to protect and restore mangroves, supportive law and policy mechanisms at global and national levels, and establishment of long-term financing for such endeavours.

TI  - Turning the Tide: How Blue Carbon and Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) Might Help Save Mangrove Forests
AB  - In this review paper, we aim to describe the potential for, and the key challenges to, applying PES projects to mangroves. By adopting a ``carbocentric approach,'' we show that mangrove forests are strong candidates for PES projects. They are particularly well suited to the generation of carbon credits because of their unrivaled potential as carbon sinks, their resistance and resilience to natural hazards, and their extensive provision of Ecosystem Services other than carbon sequestration, primarily nursery areas for fish, water purification and coastal protection, to the benefit of local communities as well as to the global population. The voluntary carbon market provides opportunities for the development of appropriate protocols and good practice case studies for mangroves at a small scale, and these may influence larger compliance schemes in the future. Mangrove habitats are mostly located in developing countries on communally or state-owned land. This means that issues of national and local governance, land ownership and management, and environmental justice are the main challenges that require careful planning at the early stages of mangrove PES projects to ensure successful outcomes and equitable benefit sharing within local communities.

TI  - Blue carbon sequestration following mangrove restoration: evidence from a carbon neutral case in China
AB  - Sequestration of blue carbon (C) in mangrove plantations depends on site characteristics and plantation management. This study evaluated the effects of plantation management on C sequestration at a C-neutral site in Xiamen, China. A field study was conducted on 10-year-old Sonneratia apetala and Kandelia obovata plantations (mono-Sa, mono-Ko) and a 15-year-old mixed plantation-. We found that mono-Ko had a significantly higher ecosystem C sequestration rate (3.32 +/- 0.62 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) than others when planted in the indirect shade of pioneer species. As a non-native species, Sonneratia performed better (0.57 +/- 0.01 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) when planted with Kandelia than in monotypic plantations. The temporary and long-term certified emission reduction (tCER and lCER) of the 12.98 ha mono-Ko was 4103.89 and 3693.50 net CO2-e within 10 years, respectively. A literature review was conducted to show the compatibility of this study with other natural and plantation sites of China and Bangladesh (the native habitat for Sonneratia). The C sequestration of Sonneratia plantation sites in China is comparable with those in Bangladesh. However, the soil C accumulation rate for a Sonneratia monotypic plantation in Bangladesh decreased with age, yet the same did not occur in the plantations of China.

TI  - Modeled approaches to estimating blue carbon accumulation with mangrove restoration to support a blue carbon accounting method for Australia
AB  - The development and refinement of methods for estimating organic carbon accumulation in biomass and soils during mangrove restoration and rehabilitation can encourage uptake of restoration projects for their ecosystem services, including those of climate change mitigation, or blue carbon. To support the development of a blue carbon method for Australia under the Emission Reduction Fund scheme we investigated; (1) whether carbon accumulation data from natural mangroves could be used to estimate carbon accumulation during restoration; (2) modeling mangrove biomass accumulation; and (3) how modeled carbon accumulation could be achieved over heterogeneous sites. First, we assessed carbon accumulation in soil and biomass pools from the global literature, finding that estimating carbon accumulation using data from natural mangroves provided similar estimates as those for restored or rehabilitated mangroves. We assessed mangrove biomass accumulation from global chronosequence studies, which we used to develop regional models for estimating biomass accumulation with restoration in Australia using values from local natural mangroves. Estimating biomass carbon accumulation using site-based means of stand biomass provided similar estimates as values estimated through use of regional means values stratified by elevation; and reduced overestimates of biomass carbon accumulation that were based on regional mean values. Modeling soil carbon accumulation over environmentally heterogeneous project sites can apply a similar approach, stratifying over variation in site elevation. Our analysis provides a strategy for modeling blue carbon pools for an Australian blue carbon method that accommodates regional differences and is based on data from natural mangroves.

TI  - Spatial Variation in Carbon Storage: A Case Study for Currambene Creek, NSW, Australia
AB  - Quantifying carbon storage in coastal wetland environments is important for identifying areas of high carbon sequestration value that could be targeted for conservation. This study combines remote sensing and sediment analysis to identify spatial variation in soil carbon storage for Currambene Creek, New South Wales, Australia to establish whether vegetation structure influences soil carbon storage in the upper 30 cm. Wetland vegetation was delineated to capture structural complexity within vegetation communities using Light detection and ranging (Lidar) point cloud data and aerial imagery with an object-based image analysis approach. Sediment cores were collected and analysed for soil carbon content to quantify below-ground carbon storage across the site. The total soil carbon storage in the upper 30 cm for the wetland (59.6 ha) was estimated to be 3933 +/- 444 Mg C. Tall mangrove were found to have the highest total carbon storage (1420 +/- 198 Mg C), however are particularly sensitive to changes in sea-level as they are positioned lowest in the intertidal frame. Conservation efforts targeted at protecting areas of high carbon sequestration, such as the tall mangrove, will lead to a greater contribution to carbon mitigation efforts.

TI  - Relevance of allochthonous input from an agriculture-dominated hinterland for â€œBlue Carbonâ€ storage in mangrove sediments in Java, Indonesia
AB  - This chapter highlights the relevance of autochthonous versus allochthonous contributions to â€œBlue Carbonâ€ storage in mangrove sediments. Mangrove ecosystems have gained major attention in the scientific community and the public in recent years, because they are considered a major natural carbon sink. However, uncertainties on the magnitude of this sink and the underlying processes are still large. A unique feature of mangrove ecosystems is their ability to store not only internally produced organic matter but also to store carbon derived from external sources. In the context of balancing anthropogenic CO2 emissions, it is of relevance to know whether the carbon stored is autochthonous, i.e., derived from the recent fixation of CO2 in the mangrove ecosystems, or it is allochthonous, i.e., relocated and possibly old carbon from other reservoirs. The relevance of these aspects is illustrated at the example of the mangrove-fringed coastal Segara Anakan Lagoon in Java, Indonesia, which is fed by a river that drains an agriculture-dominated hinterland.

TI  - Atmospheric recovery litigation around the world: Gaining natural resource damages against carbon majors to fund a sky cleanup for climate restoration1
AB  - The planetâ€™s climate emergency requires a full transition away from carbon-intensive fossil fuels as rapidly as possible. But, as ambitious as that is, decarbonization alone is not sufficient. The global mean temperature rise of over one degree Centigrade is a result of excess carbon dioxide already flooding the atmosphere, due to roughly 150 years of greenhouse gas emissions. Achieving climate recovery requires large-scale drawdown of legacy carbon - accomplishing, in effect, a Sky Cleanup. Scientists urge â€œnatural climate solutionsâ€ (NCS) projects to scrub the atmosphere of this excess carbon and sequester it in soils and vegetation. NCS projects involve reforestation, improved agricultural methods, mangrove restoration, and regenerative grazing, among other techniques. While promising, NCS solutions are expensive, and funds are elusive. This Chapter maps a legal strategy of Atmospheric Recovery Litigation to hold the major fossil fuel corporations (â€œcarbon majorsâ€) liable for funding such atmospheric cleanup. Public trust law traditionally holds polluters liable for natural resource damages to public trust assets, such as marine waters, obligating sovereign trustees to seek recovery of such damages to fund restoration of the publicâ€™s damaged ecology. This article applies these established principles to the atmosphere, a public trust asset. While atmospheric recovery on a global scale is unprecedented, the underlying legal principles parallel the approach traditionally applied to discrete resources. The analysis in this Chapter draws upon emerging litigation involving other types of pollution (caused by PCB, MTBE and PFAS chemicals) that shows early success in holding manufacturer corporations responsible for funding public cleanup efforts.

TI  - Mound plantation as an effective climate change adaptation and mitigation measure: Evaluation of the growth in the Chittagong coastal forest division of Bangladesh
AB  - Afforestation/reforestation can mitigate global climate change at low costs by reducing atmospheric carbon. The coastal plantations can act for both climate change mitigation and adaptation apart from protecting coastal people from sea-born calamities. In the global sea-level rise scenario, experimenting with the growth of the non-mangrove tree species in the coastal saline soil is a distinctive approach to observe the effects of salinity on the non-mangrove trees. The present study conducted such an experiment, species planted in the saline soil's mound in the Kattoli forest beat under the Chittagong coastal forest division for four non-mangrove tree species, i.e., Acacia auriculiformis, Casuarina equisetifolia, Samanea saman, and Terminalia arjuna. The study evaluated their growth performance and carbon sequestration potential by comparing them with the embankment plantation of the same tree species. The stem density was the highest, 2651 Â± 174 per ha in the embankment, and the lowest, 1536 Â± 101 per ha in the m15-16 mound plantation. Considering all the tree species, the highest biomass growth including aboveground and belowground, 195.44 Â± 21.91 t haâˆ’1, and the total biomass's net MAI, 21.46 Â± 2.81 t haâˆ’1yrâˆ’1, was in the embankment among the given sites. Accordingly, the embankment shows the highest sequestration of carbon in the biomass, including aboveground and belowground, 97.72 Â± 10.96 tC haâˆ’1, and the m15-16 site shows the lowest, 17.64 Â± 2.90 tC haâˆ’1. The highest salinity, 8.73 Â± 1.30 mS/m, was in the m14-15 site and the lowest, 1.43 Â± 0.41, was in the embankment. The study concludes that salinity ranging from 1.91 mS/m to 16.52 mS/m can support the selected trees to grow. It was evident that the non-mangrove tree species' growth was retarded by the ebb and tide and salinity of the soil. The study is expected to be helpful to climate change mitigation and adaptation practitioners in Bangladesh. Â© 2021 The Authors

TI  - Methane emissions from subtropical and tropical mangrove ecosystems in Taiwan
AB  - Mangroves are one of the blue carbon ecosystems. However, greenhouse gas emissions from mangrove soils may reduce the capacity of carbon storage in these systems. In this study, methane (CH4) fluxes and soil properties of the top 10 cm layer were determined in subtropical (Kandelia obovata) and tropical (Avicennia marina) mangrove ecosystems of Taiwan for a complete seasonal cycle. Our results demonstrate that CH4 emissions in mangroves cannot be neglected when constructing the carbon budgets and estimating the carbon storage capacity. CH4 fluxes were significantly higher in summer than in winter in the Avicennia mangroves. However, no seasonal variation in CH4 flux was observed in the Kandelia mangroves. CH4 fluxes were significantly higher in the mangrove soils of Avicennia than in the adjoining mudflats; this trend, however, was not necessarily recapitulated at Kandelia. The results of multiple regression analyses show that soil water and organic matter content were the main factors regulating the CH4 fluxes in the Kandelia mangroves. However, none of the soil parameters assessed show a significant influence on the CH4 fluxes in the Avicennia mangroves. Since pneumatophores can transport CH4 from anaerobic deep soils, this study suggests that the pneumatophores of Avicennia marina played a more important role than soil properties in affecting soil CH4 fluxes. Our results show that different mangrove tree species and related root structures may affect greenhouse gas emissions from the soils. Â© 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Carbon offset market methodologies applicable for coastal wetland restoration and conservation in the United States: A review
AB  - Coastal wetlands have been valued for a variety of ecosystem services including carbon sequestration and long term storage. The carbon sequestered and stored in coastal habitat including mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds is termed as blue carbon. However, these systems are threatened mainly due to sea level rise, limited sediment supply, edge erosion, and anthropogenic influences. These habitats require restoration and conservation to continue providing ecosystem services. The incentive for emission reductions, referred to as carbon offsets, is well established for other ecosystems like forestry and agriculture. Some blue carbon offset methodologies or protocols have been certified by various voluntary carbon markets; however to date, a few wetland restoration carbon offset in the US has been transacted. Thus, the goal of this paper is to discuss the existing carbon market and carbon market methodologies applicable to coastal wetland restoration and conservation in the US. Currently, four wetland carbon offset methodologies have been approved in the carbon market. These methodologies are site and/or project-specific depending on the type of the wetlands, vulnerability to loss, and restoration need. The appropriate carbon stock and Green House Gas (GHG) emission assessment is the basis of determining carbon offsets. Simplification of the existing methodologies and development of new site and project-specific methodologies could potentially help to realize blue carbon offsets in practice. The slowly growing demand for carbon offsets in the carbon market could potentially be fulfilled from the blue carbon pool. While this carbon offset is in the early stages, this review may help the inclusion of carbon offset component in the coastal restoration and conservation projects in United States and potentially across the globe.

TI  - Lesson Learned from Belitung Mangrove Park: Converting InactiveTin Mining Area to Mangrove Tourism Park to Support Ecosystem Rehabilitation and Carbon Sequestration
AB  - Unconventional tin mining is devouring coastal forest and mangrove in Belitung Island. Thus, carbon emission from deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and increasing vulnerability of coastal communities are inevitable. TERANGI together with ICCTF initiated Belitung Mangrove Park (BMP) to convert inactive tin mining in Seberang Bersatu Community Forest, Belitung, into a mangrove tourism park. Local community were trained in ecotourism management, mangrove rehabilitation, ecosystem monitoring, tour guiding, promotion, and financial management. The total carbon stock in Juru Sebrang Community Forest equalled to 4,704.159 tonnes with unequal distribution. Mangrove rehabilitation was conducted over a 1.5 ha with current carbon stock of 3 tonnes. In order to support low-carbon ecotourism activities, two solar power electric generator were installed and able to reduce emissions of 872 kg CO2/year. The local community was able to develop, promote, and manage ecotourism activities independently, and increased their group assets, from IDR 698,014,118 to IDR 18,655,700,000 just within 18 months. Tourist visits increased from around 3,000 visits/month to 14,000 visits/month. The programme also involved stakeholders from programme development, area management plan, and research and monitoring, thus increasing the participation and supports from both the local and national stakeholders. The programme success and lesson-learned could also be replicated in other areas. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Indonesia Provincial Spatial Plans on mangroves in era of decentralization: Application of content analysis to 27 provinces and â€œblue carbonâ€ as overlooked components
AB  - The salience of mangroves as carbon sinks are being increasingly recognized in terms of â€œblue carbon.â€ Their significance at provincial level is critical in the era of decentralization after the reformation period. This study applied a content analysis to 27 Provincial Spatial Plans in Indonesia. The results were categorized into nine clusters. The findings indicated that the cluster prohibited activity was the most frequently mentioned in the context of management and utilization across provinces. This was followed by mangroveâ€™s potential to be utilized as tourism and educational sites, while the aspect of â€œblue carbonâ€ was largely overlooked. The results indicated the usefulness of Provincial Spatial Plans as a benchmark for the priorities and awareness of lower-level governments concerning mangroves.

TI  - Dynamics of methane in mangrove forest: Will it worsen with decreasing mangrove forests?
AB  - Mangrove forests sequester a significant amount of organic matter in their sediment and are recognized as an important carbon storage source (i.e., blue carbon, including in seagrass ecosystems and other coastal wetlands). The methane-producing archaea in anaerobic sediments releases methane, a greenhouse gas species. The contribution to total greenhouse gas emissions from mangrove ecosystems remains controversial. However, the intensity CH4 emissions from anaerobic mangrove sediment is known to be sensitive to environmental changes, and the sediment is exposed to oxygen by methanotrophic (CH4-oxidizing) bacteria as well as to anthropogenic impacts and climate change in mangrove forests. This review discusses the major factors decreasing the effect of mangroves on CH4 emissions from sediment, the significance of ecosystem protection regarding forest biomass and the hydrosphere/soil environment, and how to evaluate emission status geospatially. An innovative â€œdigital-twinâ€ system overcoming the difficulty of field observation is required for suggesting sustainable mitigation in mangrove ecosystems, such as a locally/regionally/globally heterogenous environment with various random factors.

TI  - Plantation Methods and Restoration Techniques for Enhanced Blue Carbon Sequestration by Mangroves
AB  - Global warming and associated climate change is one of the focal environmental problems of this decade. So, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) initiatives focuses on plantation programs in tropical/sub-tropical areas of the globe. Mangroves are group of plants with adaptations to survive in hyper-saline environment along the tropical/sub-tropical coastlines. As mangrove soil is anoxic with high salt content, C-sequestration potential of mangrove ecosystem is greater than any other terrestrial biomes. Litter fall and slow decomposition rate results in enriched organic carbon, organic matter, humic acid and fulvic acid in soil. It is reported that the litter alone contribute 2.07 Teragram of organic carbon enhancement at Sundarnbans mangrove ecosystem which is the world's largest contiguous mangrove forest and recently designated as a Ramsar wetland with site number 2370. Recent researches at Indian Sundarbans showed that the plantation of mangrove plants can increase the organic carbon density from 54-69 ton per ha to 83-132 ton per ha in a period of 5 years whereas the C-sequestration in mangrove sediments of Vietnam increased by 9.7\% due to plantation activity with a high organic carbon density of 71-82 ton per ha. Mangroves plantations shows low survival rate due to their sensitivity of environmental fluctuations. Establishing nursery with proper water drainage system, to raise propagules to approximately a height of 30-45 cm is advised before transplantation in plantation areas. Rhizophora mucronata a true mangrove of Rhizophoraceae family having stilt root adaptation, shows better survival if planted through trench and drainage method. Avicennia marina of Avicenniaceae family, can grow well with distribution of seedling directly after clearing a mudflat colonized by Porteresia coarctata, a Poaceae family pioneer species at Sundarban ecosystem. Fish bone canal can be used to restore sparse/degraded mangrove patches by improving tidal water flow. Low survival rate of restored mangroves can be attributed to local factors as well as uncontrolled livestock grazing, growth of algal species like Ulva sp. and Enteromorpha sp. on young plants, infestation of crabs or poor water drainage in the sites. Hence post plantation care is required and participation of local community through group based organizations through mediation of local non-governmental organizations (NGO's) is effective in ensuring better survival of restored mangroves. Awareness campaigns to motivate and mobilize local populace prior to any plantation programs proved to be successful endeavor in respect of mangrove plantations.

TI  - Effects of Elevated CO2 Concentrations on C-13 Fractionation during Photosynthesis, Post-Photosynthesis and Night Respiration in Mangrove Saplings Avicennia marina and Rhizophora stylosa
AB  - Carbon fractionation (Delta C-13) is well documented for various plants functional types. Yet, specific studies on Delta C-13 on mangroves are particularly rare although they have a key role in coastal carbon (C) cycling. In this study, we investigated the C-13 exchanges between leaves and the atmosphere and between the main plant's organs in two common mangroves species, Avicennia marina and Rhizophora stylosa subjected to two different CO2 concentrations. Two-years-old saplings were grown in mesocosms during one year under 400 ppm and 800 ppm of CO2. At the end of the experiment, the isotopic value of the night-respired CO2 was measured on six individuals for each species and CO2 treatment. Then, 60 saplings were harvested to measure the organs delta C-13 values, and, finally, carbon fractionation (Delta C-13) during photosynthesis, post-photosynthesis and apparent Delta C-13 during night respiration were calculated. Results indicated that elevated CO2 reduced Delta C-13 during photosynthesis by 13\% and during night respiration by 20\%. Alongside, within-plant Delta C-13 was twice higher in the saplings grown under elevated CO2 concentrations. These results showed that ongoing and future increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations have the potential to modify the delta C-13 values of mangrove trees. These results could have important implications in Blue Carbon sciences, and particularly in the comprehension of future carbon cycling in coastal wetlands, mangroves being an essential link in terrestrial and marine food webs along tropical and subtropical coastlines.

TI  - Alteration of extracellular enzyme activity and microbial abundance by biochar addition: Implication for carbon sequestration in subtropical mangrove sediment
AB  - Biochar has attracted more and more attention due to its essential role in adsorbing pollutants, improving soil fertility, and modifying greenhouse gas emission. However, the influences of biochar on extracellular enzyme activity and microbial abundance are still lack and debatable. Currently, there is no information about the impact of biochar on the function of mangrove ecosystems. Therefore, we explored the effects of biochar on extracellular enzyme activity and microbial abundance in subtropical mangrove sediment, and further estimated the contribution of biochar to C sequestration. In this study, sediments were amended with 0 (control), 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0% of biochar and incubated at 25Â Â°C for 90 days. After incubation, enzyme activities, microbial abundance and the increased percentage of sediment organic C content were determined. Both increase (phenol oxidase and Î²-glucosidase) and decrease (peroxidase, N-acetyl-glucosaminidase and acid phosphatase) of enzyme activities were observed in biochar treatments, but only peroxidase activity showed statistical significance (at least pÂ <Â 0.01) compared to the control. Moreover, the activities of all enzymes tested were significantly related to the content of biochar addition (at least pÂ <Â 0.05). On the other hand, bacterial and fungal abundance in biochar treatments were remarkably lower than control (pÂ <Â 0.001), and the significantly negative relationship (pÂ <Â 0.05) between bacterial abundance and the content of biochar was found. Additionally, the increased percentage of organic C gradually increased with biochar addition rate, which provided evidence for applying biochar to mitigate climate change. Given the importance of microorganisms and enzyme activities in sediment organic matter decomposition, the increased C sequestration might be explained by the large decrease of microbial abundance and enzyme activity after biochar intervention.

TI  - Process Controls of the Live Root Zone and Carbon Sequestration Capacity of the Sundarbans Mangrove Forest, Bangladesh
AB  - The conservation of coastal wetland ecosystems, like mangrove forests and salt marshes, represents a critical strategy for mitigating atmospheric emissions and climate change in the 21st century. Yet the existence of these environments is threatened by human-induced disturbances, namely deforestation and accelerated sea-level rise. Coastal systems maintain surface elevation in response to sea-level rise through a combination of physical and biological processes both above and below the ground surface. The quantification and relative contribution of belowground process controls (e.g., seasonal water content, organic matter decomposition) on surface elevation change is largely unexplored but crucial for informing coastal ecosystem sustainability. To address this knowledge deficit, we integrated measurements of surface elevation change of the live root zone (0.5 to 1 m depth) with geotechnical data from co-located sediment cores in the Sundarbans mangrove forest (SMF) of southwest Bangladesh. Core data reveal that the primary belowground controls on surface elevation change include seasonal fluctuations in pore-water content and the relative abundance of fine-grained sediments capable of volumetric expansion and contraction, supporting an elevation gain of ~2.42 Â± 0.26 cm yearâˆ’1. In contrast to many mangrove environments, the soils of the SMF contain little organic matter and are dominantly composed (&gt;90%) of inorganic clastic sediments. The mineral-rich soil texture likely leads to less compaction-induced subsidence as compared to organic-rich substrates and facilitates surface equilibrium in response to sea level rise. Despite a relatively high soil bulk density, soil carbon (C) density of the SMF is very low owing to the dearth of preserved organic content. However, rates of C accumulation are balanced out by locally high accretion rates, rendering the SMF a greater sink of terrestrial C than the worldwide mangrove average. The findings of this study demonstrate that C accumulation in the SMF, and possibly other alluvial mangrove forests, is highly dependent on the continued delivery of sediment to the mangrove platform and associated settings.

TI  - Effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 and increased tidal flooding on leaf gas-exchange parameters of two common mangrove species: Avicennia marina and Rhizophora stylosa
AB  - In this study, we examined interactive effects of elevated atmospheric CO2, concentrations, and increased tidal flooding on two mangroves species, Avicennia marina and Rhizophora stylosa. Leaf gas-exchange parameters (photosynthesis, transpiration rates, water-use efficiency, stomatal conductance, and dark respiration rates) were measured monthly on more than 1000 two-year-old seedlings grown in greenhouses for 1Â year. In addition, stomatal density and light curve responses were determined at the end of the experiment. Under elevated CO2 concentrations (800Â ppm), the net photosynthetic rates were enhanced by more than 37% for A. marina and 45% for R. stylosa. This effect was more pronounced during the warm season, suggesting that an increase in global temperatures would further enhance the photosynthetic response of the considered species. Transpiration rates decreased by more than 15 and 8% for A. marina and R. stylosa, respectively. Consequently, water-use efficiency increased by 76% and 98% for A. marina and R. stylosa, respectively, for both species, which will improve drought resistance. These responses to elevated CO2 were minimized (by 5%) with longer flooding duration. Consequently, future increases of atmospheric CO2 may have a strong and positive effect on juveniles of A. marina and R. stylosa during the next century, which may not be suppressed by the augmentation of tidal flooding duration induced by sea-level rise. It is possible that this effect will enhance seedling dynamic by increasing photosynthesis, and therefore will facilitate their settlements in new area, extending the role of mangrove ecosystems in carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation.

TI  - Blue carbon of Mexico, carbon stocks and fluxes: a systematic review
AB  - Mexico has more than 750,000 ha of mangroves and more than 400,000 ha of seagrasses. However, approximately 200,000 ha of mangroves and an unknown area of seagrass have been lost due to coastal development associated with urban, industrial and tourist purposes. In 2018, the approved reforms to the General Law on Climate Change (LGCC) aligned the Mexican law with the international objectives established in the 2nd Article of the Paris Agreement. This action proves Mexico's commitment to contributing to the global target of stabilizing the greenhouse gas emissions concentration in the planet. Thus, restoring and conserving mangrove and seagrass habitats could contribute to fulfilling this commitment. Therefore, as a first step in establishing a mitigation and adaptation plan against climate change with respect to conservation and restoration actions of these ecosystems, we evaluated Mexican blue carbon ecosystems through a systematic review of the carbon stock using the standardized method of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). We used the data from 126 eligible studies for both ecosystems (n = 1220). The results indicated that information is missing at the regional level. However, the average above and below ground organic carbon stocks from mangroves in Mexico is 113.6 +/- 5.5 (95\% CI {[}99.3-118.4]) Mg C-org ha(-1) and 385.1 +/- 22 (95\% CI {[}344.5 431.9]) Mg C-org ha(-1), respectively. The variability in the C-org stocks for both blue carbon ecosystems in Mexico is related to variations in climate, hydrology and geomorphology observed along the country's coasts in addition to the size and number of plots evaluated with respect to the spatial cover. The highest values for mangroves were related to humid climate conditions, although in the case of seagrasses, they were related to low levels of hydrodynamic stress. Based on the official extent of mangrove and seagrass area in Mexico, we estimate a total carbon stock of 237.7 Tg C-org from mangroves and 48.1 Tg C-org from seagrasses. However, mangroves and seagrasses are still being lost due to land use change despite Mexican laws meant to incorporate environmental compensation. Such losses are largely due to loopholes in the legal framework that dilute the laws' effectiveness and thus ability to protect the ecosystem. The estimated emissions from land use change under a conservative approach in mangroves of Mexico were approximately 24 Tg CO(2)e in the last 20 years. Therefore, the incorporation of blue carbon into the carbon market as a viable source of supplemental finance for mangrove and seagrass protection is an attractive win-win opportunity.

TI  - Monitoring the Sediment Surface Elevation Change across a Chronosequence of Restored Stands of Tropical Mangroves and Their Contemporary Carbon Sequestration in Soil Pool
AB  - Over the past 30 years, 30%â€“40% of the worldâ€™s mangroves have been lost and continue to be lost to deforestation. In recent years, mangrove rehabilitation projects have increased, replac-ing once natural and diverse mangrove forests with monotypic stands (e.g., Rhizophora mucronata). However, the vulnerability to sea level rise of these artificial stands and their effectiveness at provid-ing ecosystem services is unclear. To address these gaps, we compared the rate of sediment surface elevation change and contemporary soil C sequestration across three differently aged mangrove plantations (5, 10, 25 years) in relation to a natural mangrove forest in Quezon province, Philippines using rod surface elevation tables (rSETs) and soil C analyses. Over a 3â€year period, we found that the elevation of the 5â€yearâ€old plantation had the highest rate (6.12 mm yrâˆ’1), followed by 10â€year-old (1.70 mm yrâˆ’1) and 25â€yearâ€old (0.16 mm yrâˆ’1) plantations, while the natural stand had a decreas-ing rate (âˆ’1.9 mm yrâˆ’1). In addition, the mean soil carbon contemporary sequestration rate was 226, 123, and 8.9 g C mâˆ’2 yearâˆ’1 for the 5â€, 10â€, and 25â€yearâ€old plantations. Old mangroves have bigger carbon stocks, whereas young mangrove plantations are more resilient to SLR and have higher contemporary carbon sequestration rates. Except for biomass and basal area, we found no correlation of the sediment elevation change and soil C sequestration rates with other stand variables. Apart from the 5â€yearâ€old plantations, the rates of sediment elevation change obtained are less than the global (3.2 mm yearâˆ’1 ) and local (2â€“4 mm yearâˆ’1) rates of sea level rise (SLR). These suggest that most of the forested coastal wetlands studied are not keeping pace with SLR and may potentially drown if there is no available land behind them to retreat. This also indicates that proâ€active solutions such as strict protection must be made. Â© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Biomass and carbon storage in a continental wetland in Cuitzeo, MichoacÃ¡n, Mexico [Biomasa y carbono almacenado en un humedal continental en Cuitzeo, MichoacÃ¡n, MÃ©xico]
AB  - Wetlands provide multiple ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration both in living biomass and in the soil. In MÃ©xico, most studies have been done in coastal wetlands, mainly mangroves, and for this reason information on continental wetlands is scarce. Two research questions were answered: how much carbon is stored in the biomass and in the soil of a continental wetland?; and, which is the spatial structure and distribution of the dominant plant species? The study site is a floating wetland in the eastern part of lake Cuitzeo where field work was carried out during 2'17 and 2018. Following a transect six points were selected and aerial biomass was harvested in one square meter plots, and a soil profile was excavated. Carbon content was analyzed from samples of the dominant species and aparent density and carbon stored in the soil determined. Satellite imagery was analized to obtain the total area of the wetland in the period 2003- 2017 and the area damaged by fires was calculated. Aerial biomass of the dominant species ranged from 5770 kg/m2 to 2495 kg/m2. The substrate contains 92617 tons of carbon. It was detected that the invasive species Phragmites australis has increased its cover in 10 % of the total wetland area from 2010 to 2017. Two major fires were detected, the largest in 2016 that covered 242 ha of a total of 535 ha. Â© 2021 Instituto Mexicano de Tecnologia del Agua. All rights reserved.

TI  - Total alkalinity production in a mangrove ecosystem reveals an overlooked Blue Carbon component
AB  - Mangroves have the capacity to sequester organic carbon (Corg) in their sediments permanently. However, the carbon budget of mangroves is also affected by the total alkalinity (TA) budget. Principally, TA emitted from carbonate sediment dissolution is a perennial sink of atmospheric CO2. The assessment of the TA budget of mangrove carbonate sediments in the Red Sea revealed a large TA emission of 403 Â± 17 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1, independent of light, seasons, or the presence of pneumatophores, compared to âˆ’36 Â± 10 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1 in lagoon sediment. We estimate the TA emission from carbonate dissolution in Red Sea mangroves supported a CO2 uptake of 345 Â± 15 gC mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1, 23-fold the Corg burial rate of 15 gC mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1. The focus on Corg burial in sediments may substantially underestimate the role of mangroves in CO2 removal. Quantifying the role of mangroves in climate change mitigation requires carbonate dissolution to be included in assessments. Â© 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds are important components of coastal blue carbon, with much higher carbon burials in sediment than those in terrestrial ecosystems. Carbon accumulation rate (CAR) is a key index to evaluate the carbon sequestration capacity of coastal blue carbon ecosystems. This review introduced the principle of a long-term monitoring system, the surface elevation table-marker horizon (SET-MH), and its application in CAR evaluation in coastal wetlands. The SET-MH methods have been globally used in blue carbon sequestration capacity assessment. The establishment of the SET monitoring systems in the coasts of China will obtain in situ data set of surface elevation change and CAR, which will serve for the blue carbon assessments and provide basic information for the national carbon neutrality strategy.

TI  - Lateral Export and Sources of Subsurface Dissolved Carbon and Alkalinity in Mangroves: Revising the Blue Carbon Budget
AB  - Mangroves are carbon-rich ecosystems that store large quantities of carbon, mostly in soils. Early carbon (C) budgets indicated that >50\% of mangrove C fixation was unaccounted for. This `missing C' has now been discovered to be a large release (423 Tg C a(-1)) of porewater dissolved DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and total alkalinity (17 T-MOL a(-1)) via lateral export derived from bacterial decomposition of soil organic matter. This large export originates from DIC produced over at least a 1.0-1.5 m soil profile (280-420 Tg C a(-1)) via decomposition of autochthonous and allochthonous inputs and/or likely mineralization in deep (>= 1 m) ancient soils. DOC and DIC export from mangroves equate to 41\% and approximate to 100\% of export from the world's tropical rivers, respectively. A newly revised blue carbon budget for the world's mangroves indicates a mean ecosystem gross primary production (GPP(E)) to ecosystem respiration (R-E) ratio of 1.35 and a net ecosystem production (NEP) of 794 g C m(-2) a(-1) (= global NEP of 117 Tg C a(-1)), reflecting net autotrophy. C-ORG burial is 5\% and 9\% of GPP(E) and NEPE, respectively. Mean R(E/)GPP(E) is 0.74 and carbon use efficiency averages 0.57, higher than for tropical humid forests (0.35).

TI  - Soil inorganic carbon in mangroves of tropical China: Patterns and implications
AB  - Soil inorganic carbon (IC) is neglected in most blue carbon studies despite the globally significant role of the calcium carbonate cycle in ocean C balance and climate change. We sampled soils to 1 m depth from seven mangrove reserves in Hainan Island, China. Only 45 out of 509 samples were rich in IC (greater than 10 mg cm23). Most of the IC-rich samples were found at the outer part of Qinglan Bay, which is adjacent to the largest coral reef zone of Hainan Island. Soil IC concentration ranged from 0 to 66 g kg21 (or 0â€“67 mg cm23), accounting for 0â€“92% of total C. IC concentration increased with soil depth where it was abundant. Soil pH was low (2.36â€“6.59) in IC-depleted soils, but increased to 5.67â€“7.99 in IC-rich soils. Soil total C stock and IC stock in mangroves of Hainan amounted to 0.76106 and 0.12106 Mg, respectively, with IC accounting for 16% of total C. Our study finds that carbonate concentrations can be high in mangrove soils but their spatial distribution indicates they are largely allochthonous in origin. Evidence of carbonate dissolution in mangroves suggests mangroves may increase total alkalinity to buffer acidification in seawater. & 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

TI  - Mangroves provide blue carbon ecological value at a low freshwater cost
AB  - ``Blue carbon{''} wetland vegetation has a limited freshwater requirement. One type, mangroves, utilizes less freshwater during transpiration than adjacent terrestrial ecoregions, equating to only 43\% (average) to 57\% (potential) of evapotranspiration (ET). Here, we demonstrate that comparative consumptive water use by mangrove vegetation is as much as 2905 kL H2O ha(-1) year(-1) less than adjacent ecoregions with E-c-to-ET ratios of 47-70\%. Lower porewater salinity would, however, increase mangrove E-c-to-ET ratios by affecting leaf-, tree-, and stand-level eco-physiological controls on transpiration. Restricted water use is also additive to other ecosystem services provided by mangroves, such as high carbon sequestration, coastal protection and support of biodiversity within estuarine and marine environments. Low freshwater demand enables mangroves to sustain ecological values of connected estuarine ecosystems with future reductions in freshwater while not competing with the freshwater needs of humans. Conservative water use may also be a characteristic of other emergent blue carbon wetlands.

TI  - Mangrove restoration built soil organic carbon stocks over six decades: a chronosequence study
AB  - Purpose Mangrove restoration has been suggested to have a great potential for global change mitigation due to the large carbon sequestration capacity of mangroves. However, the temporal and spatial dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) storage following mangrove restoration remains less examined and reported. To fill the knowledge gap, this study examined the SOC stocks and soil physicochemical properties among bare mudflats and adjacent mangroves at different stand ages. Methods We collected soil cores from bare mudflats and adjacent 7-, 10-, 15-, and 60-year-old mangroves on Ximen Island, Zhejiang Province, China. SOC, pH, salinity, particle size, and dry bulk density were determined. The analysis of variance was used to test for significant differences in above parameters among mangroves with different ages and mudflats. Pearson's correlation was conducted to assess the relationship of SOC contents and other soil physicochemical properties. Results Our results showed that SOC stock increased exponentially following restoration, reaching an asymptotic trend after 15-year mangrove restoration. The 60-year-old mangrove forests had significantly higher SOC stocks (94.31 +/- 4.99 Mg OC ha(-1)) compared to the unvegetated mudflat (76.25 +/- 1.65 Mg SOC ha(-1)) and the 7-year-old transplanted sites (79.04 +/- 5.30 Mg OC ha(-1)). Soil salinity, pH, and bulk density increased significantly within the whole depth, except decreasing trend of salinity in lower depth (> 25 cm). Soil texture was finer in mudflats and early stages of mangrove plantations than that in other sites. Conclusion This study indicated that mangrove transplantation can substantially enhance SOC stocks within 15 years after afforestation. These results provide key data on the effectiveness of mangrove afforestation on carbon sequestration to inform blue carbon policies.

TI  - Social consideration for blue carbon management
AB  - Coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, seagrass beds, and salt marsh provide ecosystem services to mitigate climate change. The stored carbon is called blue carbon. To date, studies relating strategy to enhance blue carbon storage is emerging. In developing a strategy to be applied to a natural resource, it is necessary to consider how it is affected and influences its people's lives. Meanwhile, the studies related to blue carbon management's social aspects are lacking compared to technical and policy aspects. This paper aims to identify peer-reviewed documents that discuss social aspects in the context of blue carbon management. This study uses a semi-systematic review approach by reviewing relevant documents based on determined keyword search terms. This study suggests that livelihood, land tenure, local knowledge, and local capacity are essential to incorporate in blue carbon management. The strategy must enforce communities to hold a significant role in governance. Those aspects would help to increase community engagement to manage and support blue carbon management. However, more extensive practical studies are needed to apply strategies on the real subject to strengthen the theory in recent literature. Â© 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

TI  - Environmental drivers of blue carbon burial and soil carbon stocks in mangrove forests
AB  - Mangroves can sequester and store massive amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere in the form of live plant and detrital biomass. Large amounts of autochthonous and allochthonous carbon (C) are also stored in sediments, where waterlogged and anoxic conditions inhibit microbial breakdown of organic matter. As a result, C buried in sediments of mangroves can remain there for millennia if left undisturbed, making them critical long-term C sinks. These high levels of aboveground and belowground C stocks have elevated the importance of mangroves and other blue carbon habitats in climate change mitigation and adaptation as well as efforts to protect and restore them. While methods have been developed for quantifying and reporting C stocks, the environmental drivers that influence the accumulation and retention of C stocks in blue carbon habitats are lesser known. Identifying important drivers of C accumulation in blue carbon habitats will increase conservation and restoration efforts so that they can continue to mitigate climate change by offsetting greenhouse gas emissions. Successful restoration and conservation activities can also be used in nationally determined commitments or in voluntary C markets. This chapter will explore the biological, biogeochemical, and geomorphological drivers that influence C burial in mangrove sediments. Â© 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Carbon source characterisation and historical carbon burial in three mangrove ecosystems on the South West coast of India
AB  - Tropical mangrove environments have high carbon sequestration potential and this ecosystem service is currently used in mitigating climate change. However, these environments are declining rapidly in developing countries, diminishing their carbon sequestration potential and may ultimately transforming them as carbon dioxide sources. This study investigated the carbon sequestration potential through sediment burial at three mangrove habitats of Cochin, South-West coast of India. High burial estimates were recorded at two mangrove stations (2.95 Â± 0.79â€“10.41 Â± 2.50 t C haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1), but consistent with other tropical mangrove areas. Lower burial rates were estimated at one station (0.57 Â± 0.24 t C haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1). Eighty percent of the mangrove net primary productivity through litterfall (NPPL) was stored in the sediment at the station with the highest burial rate, which is demonstrative of a robust carbon sink. However, at a different site, which is subject to aquaculture, only 7.23 % of NPPL was buried in the sediment. A major portion of the fixed carbon at this site is presumably emitted back to the atmosphere or exported to adjacent water bodies. The median total regional mangrove carbon burial rate in this study was 2.95 t C haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1 and the organic carbon burial rate was 1.93 Â± 0.75 t C haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1. Biological factors such as mangrove biomass, litterfall and crab density have played a major role in controlling the sediment carbon burial rate. Sediment texture and bulk sediment accumulation acted as secondary controlling factors. The carbon source characterisation in the sediment profile using stable isotope techniques revealed the organic carbon origin as mangrove litter. Gaining a better understanding of carbon sources, burial rates and their controlling factors in mangrove habitats aids in regional climate mitigation efforts and global efforts to increase the carbon sequestration potential of tropical mangrove systems.

TI  - Decomposition of mangrove roots depends on the bulk density they grew in
AB  - Aims Mangroves hold large organic carbon (C) stocks in their soils. These C stocks are mainly attributed to the high productivity and slow decomposition of the below-ground biomass. Rates of decomposition are strongly influenced by edaphic factors including soil bulk density (BD). Hence, this study assessed the influence of soil BD on mangrove root material and its effect on decomposition. Methods To determine the effect of the BD in which the plants were grown on decomposition rates (i.e. mass loss), four mangrove species were grown in soils of six different BD. The root material was then placed in litterbags and incubated in mangrove forest soil for three months. Additionally, the root material was analysed for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), as well as lignin and cellulose content. Results The soil BD experienced during root growth strongly affected mass loss, which decreased with increasing soil BD of the growth media. Decomposition also differed among species. Variation in mass loss was likely influenced by N levels, C:N ratios and lignin content of the root tissue. Conclusion Variation in soil BD influences the C sequestration potential of mangroves, as BD affects the decomposability of mangrove root tissues.

TI  - Soil C quantities of mangrove forests, their competing land uses, and their spatial distribution in the coast of Honda Bay, Philippines
AB  - Mangrove forests provide many ecosystem goods and services and they contain large amount of carbon (C) especially in their soil. Yet, their global area is still declining owing to conversion to non-forest land uses. While studies have been conducted on mangrove soil C stocks, our knowledge on how C stocks of mangrove forests compare with those of non-forest land uses that replaced them is still limited. This knowledge is crucial in land use planning and decision-making in the coastal zone. Site-scale mapping and assessments of mangrove soil C stocks and the land uses that replaced them are also limited. The aim of this study was to quantify and compare the soil C stocks in mangrove forests and their competing non-forest land uses (represented by aquaculture pond, coconut plantation, salt pond and cleared mangrove), estimate soil C loss arising from conversion, and model the soil C stock distribution in the entire study site. On the average, the soil C stock of mangrove forests was 851.9Â Â±Â 87Â MgC haâˆ’Â 1 while that of their non-forest competing land uses was less than half at 365.1Â Â±Â 31Â MgC haâˆ’Â 1. Closed canopy mangrove was highest at 1040Â Â±Â 104Â MgC haâˆ’Â 1, followed by open canopy mangrove (640Â Â±Â 131Â MgC haâˆ’Â 1) while aquaculture, salt pond and cleared mangrove had comparable C stocks (454Â Â±Â 32, 401Â Â±Â 9, 413Â Â±Â 25Â MgC haâˆ’Â 1, respectively) and coconut plantation had the least (42Â Â±Â 0.7Â MgC haâˆ’Â 1). Overall, the reduction in soil C stock (soil C loss) due to land use conversion in mangrove ranged from 398 to 809Â MgCÂ haâˆ’Â 1 (mean: 486.8Â MgCÂ haâˆ’Â 1) or a decline of 57% in soil C stock, on the average. It was possible to model the site-scale spatial distribution of soil C stocks and predict their values with 85% overall certainty using the Ordinary Kriging approach. Results from this study could help inform current discussions on Blue Carbon and REDDÂ + as well as policy and program development that advance research on soil C conservation and ecosystem services in coastal forested wetlands.

TI  - Modelling blue carbon farming opportunities at different spatial scales
AB  - There is a growing interest in including blue carbon ecosystems (i.e., mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses) in climate mitigation programs in national and sub-national policies, with restoration and conservation of these ecosystems identified as potential activities to increase carbon accumulation through time. However, there is still a gap on the spatial scales needed to produce carbon offsets comparable with terrestrial or agricultural ecosystems. Here, we used the Coastal Blue Carbon InVEST 3.7.0 model to estimate future net carbon sequestration in blue carbon ecosystems along Australia's Great Barrier Reef (hereafter GBR) catchments, considering different management scenarios (i.e., reintroduction of tidal exchange through the removal of barriers, sea level rise, restoring low lying land) at three different spatial scales: whole GBR coastline, regional (14,000-16,300 ha), and local (335-370 ha) scales. The focus of the restoration (i.e., tidal marshes and/or mangroves) was dependent on data availability for each scenario. Furthermore, we also estimated the monetary value of carbon sequestration under each management scenario and spatial scale assessed in the study. We found that large scale restoration of tidal marshes could potentially sequester an additional similar to 800,000 tonnes of CO(2)e by 2045 (potentially generating AU\$12 million based on the average Australia carbon price), with greater opportunities when sea level rise is accounted for in the modelling. Also, we found that regional and local projects would generate up to 23 tonnes CO(2)e ha(-1) by the end of the crediting period. Our results can guide future decisions in the blue carbon market and financing schemes, however, the return on investment is dependent on the carbon price and funding scheme available for project implementation.

TI  - Current and future carbon stocks in coastal wetlands within the Great Barrier Reef catchments
AB  - Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR) catchments include some of the world's most intact coastal wetlands comprising diverse mangrove, seagrass and tidal marsh ecosystems. Although these ecosystems are highly efficient at storing carbon in marine sediments, their soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and the potential changes resulting from climate impacts, including sea level rise are not well understood. For the first time, we estimated SOC stocks and their drivers within the range of coastal wetlands of GBR catchments using boosted regression trees (i.e. a machine learning approach and ensemble method for modelling the relationship between response and explanatory variables) and identified the potential changes in future stocks due to sea level rise. We found levels of SOC stocks of mangrove and seagrass meadows have different drivers, with climatic variables such as temperature, rainfall and solar radiation, showing significant contributions in accounting for variation in SOC stocks in mangroves. In contrast, soil type accounted for most of the variability in seagrass meadows. Total SOC stock in the GBR catchments, including mangroves, seagrass meadows and tidal marshes, is approximately 137 Tg C, which represents 9\%-13\% of Australia's total SOC stock while encompassing only 4\%-6\% of the total extent of Australian coastal wetlands. In a global context, this could represent 0.5\%-1.4\% of global SOC stock. Our study suggests that landward migration due to projected sea level rise has the potential to enhance carbon accumulation with total carbon gains between 0.16 and 0.46 Tg C and provides an opportunity for future restoration to enhance blue carbon.

TI  - Blue carbon sinks in South Africa and the need for restoration to enhance carbon sequestration
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses) contribute towards climate change mitigation because they are efficient at sequestering atmospheric CO2 into long-term total ecosystem carbon stocks. Destruction or disturbance therefore reduces sink capacity and leads to significant CO2 emissions. This study reports the first national estimates of: 1) total carbon storage, 2) CO2 emissions from anthropogenic activities, 3) the potential for restoration to enhance carbon sequestration for blue carbon ecosystems in South Africa. Mangrove ecosystems have the greatest carbon storage per unit area (253â€“534 Mg C haâˆ’1), followed by salt marshes (100â€“199 Mg C haâˆ’1) and seagrasses (45â€“144 Mg C haâˆ’1). Salt marshes are the most extensive and contribute 67 % to the national carbon stock of 4000 Gg C. Since 1930, 6500 ha has been lost across all blue carbon ecosystems (26 % of the natural extent), equivalent to losing 1086 Gg C from the national carbon stock. Historic CO2 emissions were estimated at an average rate of 30,266 t CO2e yrâˆ’1. Despite losses, a total of 3998 ha could be restored to increase carbon sequestration and CO2 removals of 14,845 tCO2e.yrâˆ’1. Extractive activities have declined rapidly in recent decades, but abiotic pressures on estuarine ecosystems (flow modification, reduced water quality, and artificial breaching) have been increasing. There is an urgent need to quantify the potential impact of these pressures and include them in estuarine management and restoration plans. Blue carbon ecosystems cover a relatively small area in South Africa, but they are valued for their multiple ecosystem services that contribute towards climate change adaptation and biodiversity co-benefits. These ecosystems need to be included in national policies driving climate change response in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land-Use (AFOLU) sector, such as incorporating them into the wetland subcategory of the national GHG inventory.

TI  - Future Mangrove Carbon Storage Under Climate Change and Deforestation
AB  - Mangroves are important sinks of organic carbon (C) and there is significant interest in their use for greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. Adverse impacts on organic carbon storage potential from future climate change and deforestation would devalue such ambitions, thus global projections of future change remains a priority research area. We modeled the effects of climate change on future C stocks and soil sequestration rates (CSR) under two climate scenarios ({''}business as usual{''}: SSP245 and high-emissions: SSP585). Model results were contrasted with CO2 equivalents (CO(2)e) emissions from past, present and future rates of deforestation on a country specific scale. For C stocks, we found climate change will increase global stocks by similar to 7\% under both climate scenarios and that this gain will exceed losses from deforestation by the end of the twenty-first century, largely due to shifts in rainfall. Major mangrove-holding countries Indonesia, Malaysia, Cuba, and Nigeria will increase national C stocks by > 10\%. Under the high-end scenario, while a net global increase is still expected, elevated temperatures and wider temperature ranges are likely increase the risk of countries' C stocks diminishing. For CSR, there will likely be a global reduction under both climate change scenarios: 12 of the top 20 mangrove-rich countries will see a drop in CSR. Modeling of published country level mangrove deforestation rates showed emissions have decreased from 141.4 to 6.4\% of annual CSR since the 1980's. Projecting current mangrove deforestation rates into the future resulted in a total of 678.50 +/- 151.32 Tg CO(2)e emitted from 2012 to 2095. Reducing mangrove deforestation rates further would elevate the carbon benefit from climate change by 55-61\%, to make the proposition of offsetting emissions through mangrove protection and restoration more attractive. These results demonstrate the positive benefits of mangrove conservation on national carbon budgets, and we identify the nations where incorporating mangrove conservation into their Nationally Defined Contributions offers a particularly rewarding route toward meeting their Glasgow Agreement commitments.

TI  - Mangrove carbon assessment tool: Model development and sensitivity analysis
AB  - It is important to have the capability to assess carbon (C) dynamics in mangrove forests and estimate their role in mitigating climate change because of their high carbon density, the threats to their integrity from land-use change and sea-level rise, and functional linkages of the many goods and services. A process-based model for mangroves was developed by integrating new features with existing biogeochemical processes in Forest-DNDC for simulating C sequestration and turnover in mangrove ecosystems. The new model is used to assess (1) the dynamics of C, nitrogen and phosphorous in mangrove ecosystems, including above-and below-ground C in saline wetlands, (2) the impacts of ecological drivers, including climate, soil nitrogen and phosphorous deficit and salt stress, on mangrove production, (3) the production of methane, and aerobic and anaerobic oxidation of methane with sulfate, nitrate and nitrite reductions, (4) the contributions of dissolved inorganic C (DIC), dissolved organic C (DOC), particulate organic C (POC) and burial C (BC) to blue C, and (5) impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on C sequestration in mangrove ecosystems. Model sensitivity analysis showed that C sequestration in mangrove ecosystems was highly sensitive to multiple ecological factors, including climate, soil phosphorus, salinity and sulfate, as well as latitude. The responses of different C components to these factors were distinct. The responses of gross and net primary productivity and aboveground biomass to alterations of mean daily temperature (MDT) were quadratic, or increasing or decreasing non-linearly with an increment or decrement in MDT, but leaf production was linear. Similarly, other mangrove C components, such as BC, DIC, DOC and POC, respond substantially to variations of the ecological drivers. The combined effects of the driving factors are complex due to their intricate interactions. For example, while mangrove productivity is sensitive to available phosphorous, phosphorous cannot mitigate the stress imposed by high salinity. These results highlight the value of a tool to assess C dynamics in mangroves, especially for regional or large mangrove forests. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Mangroves are ecologically and economically important forested wetlands with the highest carbon (C) density of all terrestrial ecosystems. Because of their exceptionally large C stocks and importance as a coastal buffer, their protection and restoration has been proposed as an effective mitigation strategy for climate change. The inclusion of mangroves in mitigation strategies requires the quantification of C stocks (both above and belowground) and changes to accurately calculate emissions and sequestration. A growing number of countries are becoming interested in using mitigation initiatives, such as REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation), in these unique coastal forests. However, it is not yet clear how methods to measure C traditionally used for other ecosystems can be modified to estimate biomass in mangroves with the precision and accuracy needed for these initiatives. Airborne Lidar (ALS) data has often been proposed as the most accurate way for larger scale assessments but the application of ALS for coastal wetlands is scarce, primarily due to a lack of contemporaneous ALS and field measurements. Here, we evaluated the variability in field and Lidar-based estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB) through the combination of different local and regional allometric models and standardized height metrics that are comparable across spatial resolutions and sensor types, the end result being a simplified approach for accurately estimating mangrove AGB at large scales and determining the uncertainty by combining multiple allometric models. We then quantified wall-to-wall AGB stocks of a tall mangrove forest in the Zambezi Delta, Mozambique. Our results indicate that the Lidar H100 height metric correlates well with AGB estimates, with R 2 between 0.80 and 0.88 and RMSE of 33% or less. When comparing Lidar H100 AGB derived from three allometric models, mean AGB values range from 192 Mg ha-1 up to 252 Mg ha-1. We suggest the best model to predict AGB was based on the East Africa specific allometry and a power-based regression that used Lidar H100 as the height input with an R 2 of 0.85 and an RMSE of 122 Mg ha-1 or 33%. The total AGB of the Lidar inventoried mangrove area (6654 ha) was 1 350 902 Mg with a mean AGB of 203 Mg ha-1 Â± 166 Mg ha-1. Because the allometry suggested here was developed using standardized height metrics, it is recommended that the models can generate AGB estimates using other remote sensing instruments that are more readily accessible over other mangrove ecosystems on a large scale, and as part of future carbon monitoring efforts in mangroves.

TI  - Climate Change Mitigation: from Carbon Cycle to Policy
AB  - Climate change can be mitigated simultaneously by two ways, maintaining the greenhouse gases below the carbon budget and conserving marine and terrestrial vegetation for carbon sequestration. Marine vegetation (e.g. mangrove and seagrass meadows) is less than 0.5\% of the total marine area and narrower compared to terrestrial vegetation. However, marine vegetation has high net primary production (NPP) and contributes more than 50\% of the global carbon burial in its substrate and biomass. Indonesia has 3,301,848 ha of mangrove area, the widest in South-East Asia. The seagrass meadows of Indonesia are 150,693 ha, the second widest seagrass area in the world. These two ecosystems are important for the global carbon cycle due to their high capacity for carbon sequestration. Considering this potential, it is necessary to promote a strategic scientific-based policy of conservation of marine vegetation areas for both local and national stakeholders. The policies consist of: 1) to implement the National/Local Action Plan for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions (RAN/D GRK); 2) to manage the land use changes that contribute 67\% of total national emissions; 3) to determine coastal ecosystem protection areas that are considering the province policy in the Plan for Zoning of Coastal Areas and Small Islands (RZWP3K); 4) to rehabilitate terrestrial vegetation, coastal ecosystems, and aquatic conservation areas (President Regulation no 61/2011); and 5) to strictly carry out the national policy for green open space (Government Regulation no 26/2008).

TI  - Scenario-based planning for reduction of emitted CO2 from the Pars Special Economic Energy Zone (PSEEZ) of Iran
AB  - The Pars Special Economic Energy Zone (PSEEZ) is one of the largest gas reserves in the world. To reduce the CO2 emission from the area in line with the international climate commitments, two groups of scenario have been developed: the first is using the ecosystem services of mangrove forests, and the second is technology development for oil and gas industries. For the first scenario, the carbon sequestrated by the trees was calculated using the allometric equation, and the carbon of sediments was determined by using the Walkleyâ€“Black method. For the second scenario, CO2 emitted from the PSEEZ was calculated by using the Iranian Petroleum Ministry Guidelines. CO2 emission from the PSEEZ was 0.030 Gt yearâˆ’1. The maximum CO2 sequestered by mangrove scenarios was 0.12% of the PSEEZ emissions, while the flaring elimination technology reduces 36% of the PSEEZ emissions. Generally, the scenario of using oil and gas industry technologies is more effective. Â© 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Carbon sequestration capacity of mangrove soils in micro tidal estuaries and lagoons: A case study from Sri Lanka
AB  - Mangroves are supreme agents in building blue carbon pools by capturing atmospheric carbon and storing them in biomass and soil. Anaerobic mangrove soils favour accumulation of partially decomposed organic matter that builds the carbon stocks over time. This study is an attempt to quantify the stock of total organic carbon (TOC) and to determine its spatial as well as vertical distribution in soils of mangrove ecosystems in Sri Lanka. Seven mangrove areas representing the wet, dry and intermediate climatic zones of Sri Lanka were chosen for this purpose. Samples were taken from three depths, (0â€“15 cm, 16â€“30 cm and 31â€“45 cm) of mangrove soils and TOC was determined by dichromate-oxidation method followed by colorimetry. Surface layers of soils (0â€“15 cm depth) in general contained high amounts of carbon, particularly in mangrove soils of the wet and intermediate climatic zones. In majority of mangrove areas TOC stocks increased with depth and across the water-land gradient. Estimated magnitude of the carbon pools in Sri Lankan mangrove soils ranged from 316.29 to 580.84 Mg ha âˆ’1 (1 Mg = 1 t = 10 3 kg) (total sampling area 13600m 2 ). Mangrove soils of Rekawa lagoon, located in the intermediate climatic zone was found to be the largest soil carbon sink (580.84 Mg ha âˆ’1 ), while that of Batticaloa lagoon in the dry zone, was the smallest (316.29 Mg ha âˆ’1 ). A statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) relationship was observed between annual rainfall and total organic carbon storage in mangrove soils. The conservative estimate of the magnitude of total carbon pool in soils of all mangrove areas in Sri Lanka that extend over 15,670 ha therefore, is 5623.70 Ã— 10 3 Mg. Mangrove soils in Sri Lanka, in their micro-tidal environment, preform a superior carbon sequestration function and therefore deserve better protection. Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A blue carbon ecosystems qualitative assessment applying the DPSIR framework: Local perspective of global benefits and contributions
AB  - Mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes or collectively known as blue carbon ecosystems are gaining salience because of their essential roles in reducing the risks and impacts of climate change through carbon sequestration and other beneficial services. Despite this, they are globally declining because of their vulnerability to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Similar trends are also observed in Busuanga Island, Palawan province in the Philippines, where blue carbon ecosystems along with other coastal environments are perceived to be threatened by a number of factors. To better understand the state changes of blue carbon ecosystems, we collected the drivers and pressures and their impact on the whole coastal ecosystem as well as existing management responses by interviewing 26 stakeholders representing community organizations, non-government organizations, and municipal level government units from two municipalities (Busuanga and Coron) in the island. We used the Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework to analyze the information gathered from the interviews. The results of this study show that lack of institutional capacities (indirect driver) is the leading factor that hinders the progress or efficacy of the management. Most pronounced pressures caused by direct drivers to blue carbon ecosystems include overexploitation and coastal developments. The responses collected in the interviews can be grouped into policies and implementation, capacity building development, welfare and livelihood development, ecosystems management, and tourism measures. The information gathered in this study can be used to improve or change existing responses into more precise and contextualized measures in addressing specific impacts observed in the local areas.
