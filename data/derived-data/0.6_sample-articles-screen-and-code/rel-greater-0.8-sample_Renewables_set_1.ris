TI  - Voltage and reactive power correlation in multi-objective optimization of an offshore grid
AB  - In the last few years, many offshore wind power plants are installed at North Sea and more are under construction. Offshore grid would be vital in the integration of future offshore wind power plant with the main land grid. Both, multi-terminal DC and AC cable systems are under consideration in the concept of future offshore grid. The reactive power and voltage operating point for such a network is important for the optimized operation. This article presents an optimization criterion of voltage and reactive power control for an offshore AC grid having a parallel connecting grid-forming converter. Multi-objective optimization problem is formulated considering four reactive power management strategies. The solution of the optimization algorithm is analysed and compared with respect to active power losses in the network, voltage variation, and reactive power contribution by the sources. The research presents a methodology to apply a suitable reactive power management strategy to achieve the best optimum operating points. The solution provides the optimum operating points for offshore wind farm reactive power, frequency and voltage droop gain values for VSC-HVDC system, and reactive power sharing factor of HVDC transmission.

TI  - Earth, wind and fire: island energy landscapes of the Anthropocene
AB  - Carbon-based systems of energy are rapidly unravelling. The imperative of climate emergency is reshaping energy landscapes, in some instances leading to the reappraisal of energy options hitherto sidelined. This paper deals with the emerging energy landscapes of the Netherlands and Iceland through historically informed tales that focus on islands. While vastly different in historical and geographical context and scale, these cases reveal the necessity of geographical nuance facilitated by the ways insular places offer insights into energy imaginaries of the Anthropocene. The former is a historicised narrative about the reinvention of wind energy as natural gas is being ousted. It focuses on the proposed Dogger Bank Power Link Islands, the first of which is scheduled to emerge in the coming years. The latter, also historically informed, identifies the context for current large wind energy proposals in Iceland, and then contrasts these with the authors' empirical observations from the small peripheral island of Grimsey. There wind energy is also being reinvented for ousting the predominant oil infrastructure on the island. These cases represent experimental opportunities for envisioning Anthropocene futures intended to destabilize imaginaries of growth in ways that open spaces for negotiation and contestation. They problematize dominant narratives that render wind energy development visible and knowable as a necessary intervention. Emergent from this is wind's decentred energy landscape in the Anthropocene; an epoch where energy is revealed in its importance to our societies, dispelling the human exceptionalism implicit in the nomenclature whilst at the same time showing how our actions come to matter. The collision of the Earth and ourselves under the terms of climate emergency begs the question whether our differences are the only ones that matter? But also, if it matters what we have done, then surely it matters what we have not done and chosen to ignore.

TI  - Will communities ``open-up{''} to offshore wind? Lessons learned from New England islands in the United States
AB  - National-scale polls demonstrate high levels of public support for developing renewable energy while local opposition has led to delays and cancelations of renewable energy projects around the world. What makes for robust public engagement processes to reject or site renewable energy projects? A literature review reveals numerous considerations, with complexity that impedes their application by practitioners. In this study, we conducted interviews and document analysis to assess the extent to which design principles from the analyticdeliberative process literature arose during public engagement on three New England islands adjacent to proposed offshore wind farms. In our study sites-amongst the array of criteria in the literature-good public engagement boiled down to two key themes: enabling bidirectional deliberative learning and providing community benefit. Decision processes perceived as effective occurred when (1) participants, including experts and local stakeholders, learned from each other while reconciling technical expertise with citizen values; and (2) outcomes included the provision of collaboratively negotiated community benefits. Our findings highlight that community benefits are not the same as benefits to groups of individuals. Attending to these key themes may improve the quality of interactions among communities, government authorities and developers when deciding if and where to site renewable energy infrastructure.

TI  - A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming approach to wind farm layout and inter-array cable routing
AB  - A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach is proposed to optimize the turbine allocation and inter-array offshore cable routing. The two problems are considered with a two steps strategy, solving the layout problem first and then the cable problem. We give an introduction to both problems and present the MILP models we developed to solve them. To deal with interference in the onshore cases, we propose an adaptation of the standard Jensen's model, suitable for 3D cases. A simple Stochastic Programming variant of our model allows us to consider different wind scenarios in the optimization. For the inter-array cable routing, we propose a new MILP model able to deal with different constraints arsing in practical application, such as capacity limitations, substation limitations and non-crossing constraints. Computational results on real-world instances prove the practical viability of the approach.

TI  - Power Smoothing Control in a Grid-Connected Marine Current Turbine System for Compensating Swell Effect
AB  - Variations of marine current speed may lead to strong fluctuations in the power extracted by a marine current turbine (MCT). During a short-time period, swell effect is the main cause for the current speed variations. The conventional tip speed ratio maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm will require the MCT to accelerate or to decelerate frequently under swell effect, which can cause severe fluctuations in the generator power. This paper focuses on power smoothing control of the grid-connected MCT system. In the first step, a modified MPPT algorithm with filter strategy is proposed in generator-side control to mitigate the fluctuation of generator power. In the second step, a supercapacitor (SC) energy storage system (ESS) is added to compensate the residual power fluctuations. Simulations of a 1.5-MW direct-driven grid-connected MCT system are carried out. The swell effect is calculated based on typical system location and sea state. Detailed control strategies and SC sizing are described. The results demonstrate that the association of the generator-side filter strategy with the SC ESS system achieves a smoothed power injected to the grid in case of swell disturbances.

TI  - Overview of Offshore Wind Power Transmission and Power Transportation Technology
AB  - In recent years, the new power system with new energy as the main body is developing rapidly, and the offshore wind power plant is developing towards the trend of deep sea and large capacity. In view of the limitations of the current transmission mode, changing the traditional cable transmission mode provides new possibilities for the research of power transmission from the perspective of transport batteries. First of all, based on the actual operation of the existing offshore wind power projects, the working principle and status quo of the main offshore wind power transmission modes, such as alternating current power transmission mode and direct current power transmission mode, were analyzed, and the working mode of the transport battery was described. Then, the technical and economic performance indexes such as transmission capacity, investment cost and security cost of transport battery and other transmission schemes were compared. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of offshore wind power transmission modes were analyzed. Â© 2022, Editorial Board of Power Generation Technology. All rights reserved.

TI  - A methodological framework for optimal siting of offshore wind farms: A case study on the island of Crete
AB  - Land-use conflicts, along with the increasing demand for green energy and the unexploited offshore wind potential, intensify the necessity of the development of Offshore Wind Farms (OWFs). Their sustainable siting remains still a research gap to be further analysed due to: (i) the need of the insular energy self-efficiency; the great distances from the mainland); (ii) the freeing of land; and (iii) the high unexploited offshore wind potential. The Analytical Hierarchy Process method and Geographic Information Systems incorporating 14 exclusion and 16 evaluation criteria are employed tÎ¿ identify sustainable siting. This research integrates the opinions of a wide range of local stakeholders and experts, considering the insular specific characteristics of Crete. The high suitable marine areas are evaluated according to their energy capacity, assessed with seven different commercially available models. Most respondents estimate that the distance from environmental interest areas is the most critical criterion. The analysis proved that the final available areas for OWFs siting are 205.5 km2; 126.25 km2 of high suitability with a high potential of 620â€“900 MW. Since the maximum annual energy demand of the island amounted to 676 MW (2019) this demand could actually be overcovered by four main OWFs near the island. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Hybrid Floating Power Station driven by Renewable Energy for Saudi Arabia Coastal Areas
AB  - This paper aims to develop an innovative solution to generate electricity using a modular Hybrid Floating Power Station (HFPS) located in SACA. The proposed floating station will offer mobility, sustainable energy source, grid-off and zero emission power source as a unique idea to harvesting three sources of renewable energies. Gulf countries are in the top list of emitters of carbon dioxide in the world; shift to renewabies energy becomes urgent to meet power demand without environmental impact. SACA region of Red Sea is one of the world's richest offshore wind potential areas, with a mean power density, at 50 m height, in the range 300-800 W/m2, at mean wind speed of 6-10 m/s. Moreover, SACA solar radiation estimated on average 2200 kWh/m2 annually. Therefore, HFPS concept is proposed as an alternative solution for effective generation of clean, affordable and sustainable electricity from waves, wind and solar sources. Site selection is investigated using GIS, AHF techniques to locate the suitable location in SACA. The proposed HFPS platform is hydrodynamically evaluated considering SACA environmental conditions. The results showed; SACA has very high potential to generate clean energy. The dynamic motions and static stability results showed; HFPS concept can operate safely and effectively in SACA environmental condition. Â© 2020 IEEE.

TI  - Stochastic analysis of a galloping-random wind energy harvesting performance on a buoy platform
AB  - A new concept of a galloping-random wind energy harvester, which is a galloping-based piezoelectric harvester mounted on a buoy platform is proposed. The galloping-random wind energy harvester can concurrently harvest galloping energy due to the aero-instability and stochastic vibration energy due to the ocean wave. The harvester performance is comprehensively investigated through wind tunnel experiments and theoretical investigation. The mathematical model of the system is formulated, and its aerodynamic galloping is then validated with wind tunnel experimental measurements. Based on the verified mathematical model of the galloping-random wind energy harvester, the stochastic average method is applied to analytically obtain the probability density functions of the system's stochastic responses and the average harvested power. The fidelity of the analytical solution is also verified by the numerical integration using the Euler-Maruyama algorithm. The results show that a unique crater phenomenon is discovered in the joint PDF of the responses, owing to the concurrent galloping and stochastic vibrations. In this case, the energy harvester exhibits a periodic galloping response with a fluctuating amplitude. The annulus range is wider when the galloping response is dominant and becomes stronger. In addition, this study investigates the average power output in terms of the stochastic excitation intensity, structural natural frequency, aerodynamic mass ratio, and normalized electrical term, to provide the useful design guidelines. The results show that the strong stochastic excitation intensity is beneficial to broadband energy harvesting and especially provides a high advantage for the low wind speed. The low structural natural frequency and large aerodynamic mass ratio can improve the performance. The parametric study also uncovers the optimal electrical term that can significantly improve the broadband average power output.

TI  - Adaptive Curtailment Plan with Energy Storage for AC/DC Combined Distribution Systems
AB  - For developing a large-scale combined system with a number of distributed resources, an appropriate compensation strategy based on the system components and changeable condition must be configured to handle the characteristics of the internal systems. Since renewable sources generate various fluctuations, the compensation plans for the storage device connected along with the sources should be supported by a precise expectation method. A cooperative strategy involving the sharing of the DC section with environmentally sensitive generators, like photovoltaic system (PVs) or waves, demands appropriate ESS compensation solutions, owing to its complexity. An active power-control algorithm with voltage-expectation based on the DC power flow is introduced in this paper and is applied in the designed case studies performed on the electromagnetic transient simulation. DC based multi-generation system is composed by applying tidal generator and super capacitor. To utilize wind energy, an offshore wind-wave generation system was utilized in the verification process.

TI  - Predictive Control for a Wave-Energy Converter Array Based on an Interconnected Model
AB  - This paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC) method based on an interconnected model to maximize the ocean wave energy extracted by a wave-energy converter (WEC) array. In the proposed method, a formally uniform interconnected model is applied to represent the dynamics of an array consisting of an arbitrary quantity of WECs, simultaneously considering the hydrodynamic interaction among all the WEC devices. First, the WEC devices and their hydrodynamic interaction are represented in an interconnected model that describes the networked dynamics of a variety of WEC arrays with distinct spatial geometry layout of the WEC devices deployed in the sea field. Second, based on the presented model, an MPC method is applied to achieve the coordinated control of the WEC array to improve its energy conversion efficiency under the constraints of buoy position and control force. Third, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform is developed to simulate the WEC array's physical operating conditions, and the proposed method is implemented on the platform to test its performance. The test results show that the proposed MPC method using the interconnected model has a higher energy harvesting efficiency than the classic MPC method.

TI  - Life cycle assessment of a barge-type floating wind turbine and comparison with other types of wind turbines
AB  - The intensive increase of global warming every year affects our world negatively and severely. The use of renewable energy sources has gained importance in reducing and eliminating the effect of global warming. To this end, new technologies are being developed to facilitate the use of these resources. One of these technological developments is the floating wind turbine. In order to evaluate the respective environmental footprint of these systems, a life cycle assessment (LCA) is herein applied. In this study, the environmental impact of floating wind turbines is investigated using a life cycle assessment approach and the results are compared with the respective ones of onshore and jacket offshore wind turbines of the same power capacity. The studied floating wind turbine has a square foundation that is open at its centre and is connected to the seabed with a synthetic fibre-nylon anchorage system. The environmental impact of all life cycles of such a structure, i.e., the manufacture, the operation, the disposal, and the recycling stages of the wind turbines, has been evaluated. For these floating wind turbines, it has been found that the greatest environmental impact corresponds to the manufacturing stage, whilst the global warming potential and the energy payback time of a 2 MW floating wind turbine of a barge-type platform is higher than that of the onshore, the jacket offshore (2 MW) and the floating (5 MW) wind turbines on a sway floating platform.

TI  - INTEGRATED ANALYSIS OF NEW ENERGY SOURCES ON THE BRITISH SUPPLY SYSTEM, METHODS AND APPLICATION.
AB  - The paper has outlined methods designed to analyse the long term role of intermittent sources on large supply systems. Applied to wind and tidal energy, results support the conclusions of several previous studies that such sources can play a significant role in supply; but also they suggest that modelling limitations, operational assumptions and the neglect of system interconnection have helped lead to a significant underestimate of the real system potential of intermittent sources. Applied to an integrated British system, the results indicate that distributed wind energy could supply around 40% of system energy without incurring serious losses, and that tidal contributions are likely to be bound by resource rather than by system constraints. The system could absorb half of its energy from the two sources combined without significant difficulties.

TI  - Re-assessment of wind energy potential with new technology in India
AB  - In India, a transition from a primarily fossil fuel-based energy system to a predominantly renewable energy system must include harnessing of winds on a large scale in combination with other renewable energies. In order to achieve energy sustainability, it is imperative that there is detailed knowledge and understanding of the potential for harnessing wind energy. Here, we present the latest detailed assessment of potential for utilization of wind energy in India with predominant technologies that are being deployed and commercially available. The assessment, for the non-Himalayan regions, using a geographic information system-based method with National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research Reanalysis data and measured wind speeds has been done. The method has been revalidated with actual measurements at 97 locations. It has been found that there is enough technically and economically viable wind energy potential to meet a major portion of current and future energy requirements in India. The total onshore and offshore potential for wind energy utilization in India is of the order of 2161-5900 GW depending on the land considerations, micro-siting and type of technology deployed.

TI  - Business model innovation for sustainable energy: How German municipal utilities invest in offshore wind energy
AB  - Offshore wind energy is considered to have tremendous potential for Germany's future electricity supply. Due to the technology's capital intensity, however, offshore wind energy has so far been considered the domain of large utilities. Municipal utilities on the contrary traditionally have strong ties to their community and conduct low risk business models at the regional and local level. Recently, however, German municipal utilities started to invest in offshore wind energy. Based on a series of interviews with municipal utility executives, the present study identifies two innovative business models and ten key drivers for municipal utilities' engagement in offshore wind energy. It is found that the new business models may have significant further potential and help to stimulate the German market. The present study contributes to the industry debate by identifying business model blueprints for offshore wind and to the academic debate by suggesting three generic types of business model innovation with different characteristics.

TI  - Is the supply chain ready for the green transformation? The case of offshore wind logistics
AB  - The transition from fossil fuel-based energy systems to renewable energy systems is a cornerstone of the green transformation to decarbonize our economic systems and mitigate climate change. Given the urgency of effective climate change mitigation, renewable energy diffusion needs to accelerate drastically. Among the many constraints to renewable energy diffusion, the important role of the supply chain is often overlooked. Therefore, this article addresses the role of the supply chain in the renewable energy diffusion process. Using the offshore wind energy sector as a case, this article presents an analysis of supply chain readiness to ascertain the role of the supply chain in the green transformation. Examining Europe and China mainly within offshore wind logistics, the research findings show that this segment of the supply chain constitutes a key bottleneck for accelerated deployment. For Europe, the key findings indicate that legislation for offshore wind beyond 2020 is necessary to ensure the implementation of the required investments in logistics assets, transport equipment, and personnel. In China, the key findings indicate that the Chinese supply chain of wind energy is mainly organized around onshore wind. Key bottlenecks exist, predominantly in logistics, and this article identifies specific areas of the supply chain where international collaboration and knowledge transfer may speed up deployment.

TI  - On the accuracy of CORDEX RCMs to project future winds over the Iberian Peninsula and surrounding ocean
AB  - The accuracy of CORDEX regional models to reproduce wind speed was assessed at 15 wind farms (216 wind turbines) and 13 oceanic buoys covering the Iberian Peninsula and surrounding ocean during 2012. Models were able to reproduce with relative accuracy both the mean wind speed, with a mean error of 19\% inland and 10\% offshore, and the wind distribution, with an overlap percentage between distributions of 82 +/- 5\% inland and 83 +/- 3\% offshore. In addition, CORDEX regional models showed a skill higher than CMIP5 general models. Wind speed and wind power were projected over the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal) and the surrounding ocean for three future periods: near future (2019-2045), midterm (2046-2072) and far future (2073-2099) both at annual and seasonal scales. Both wind speed and wind power will decrease over most of the area with the exception of some regions as: Galicia; the Atlantic coast of Galicia and north of Portugal; the Ebro Valley; the upper Douro Valley; the Guadalquivir Valley; the Strait of Gibraltar and Cape Gata where both will tend to increase. This increase is projected to occur mostly during summer except at the Strait of Gibraltar where it will occur all year long. The change in wind speed and power is higher as farthest the future period is.

TI  - Influence of Marine Growth on the Static Response of Jacket Wind Turbine
AB  - Offshore wind energy is one of the renewable energy sources. Wind energy can be extracted using vertical or horizontal axis wind turbines. These turbines need supporting system in the offshore region. In the present study, a horizontal axis offshore wind turbine (HAWT) supported on an offshore jacket structure is considered. The main structural components of an offshore wind turbine are four-legged jacket structure of height 61.0Â m (51Â m submerged) and tower of 70Â m height. This tower is supported by transition piece of height 4Â m length. The HAWT is subjected to different environmental loads such as aerodynamic, wind, wave and current. A common challenge in this supporting structure is marine growth (MG). The growth of algae on the structural elements starts with the process of transportation of the structure from main land to offshore site. The growth of algae continues after the installation and continues to an optimum thickness depending upon the exposed area and site conditions. A detailed study of the effect of marine growth on the structure is performed by developing a finite element model. Beam elements are used to model the structural elements of jacket, transition piece and tower of the wind turbine. The wind and aerodynamic loads are estimated by the provisions of API (2005) and Betz theory considering cut-in, rated, cut-out and extreme conditions. Wave forces are estimated using Airyâ€™s wave theory and Morison equation, by varying wave period from 4 to 20Â s with an increment of 2Â s. A parametric study on wave approach angles such as 0Â° and 45Â° is simulated to study the effect of wave direction. Linear current profile is considered in the estimation of current forces. A static analysis is performed using SACS 13.2 software. It is observed that the structural response is higher when marine growth (MG) is taken into consideration.

TI  - Wind-Water Experimental Analysis of Small SC-Darrieus Turbine: An Approach for Energy Production in Urban Systems
AB  - Smart cities have a significant impact on the future of renewable energies as terms such as sustainability and energy saving steadily become more common. In this regard, both wind and hydrokinetic compact-size turbines can play important roles in urban communities by providing energy to nearby consumption points in an environmentally suitable manner. To evaluate the operation of a Darrieus turbine rotor as a wind or hydro microgenerator, a series of wind tunnel and water current flume tests were performed. Power and characteristic curves were obtained for all test conditions. In the wind tests, all curves seemed to be identical, which means that the turbine rotor works properly under open-field conditions. Two blockage correction equations were applied to the water channel tests that were performed under blockage values ranging from 0.2 to 0.35 to estimate the operational behavior in open water. Finally, it has been demonstrated that, with the condition of maintaining the Reynolds number between experiments in the wind tunnel and water flume, the turbine wind characteristics represents the its operation in open-water conditions.

TI  - A coordination control strategy of voltage source converter based MTDC for offshore wind farms
AB  - This paper proposes a coordination control strategy of voltage source converter based multi-terminal DC (VSC-MTDC) transmission system for integrating large-scale offshore wind power. Using a typical five-terminal DC transmission system as an example, coordination control strategy based on local controller among converter stations is proposed. Based on the DC voltage -Active power characteristic, improved control strategy for auxiliary converter station and APC converter station are proposed respectively. Also the working mode of the two converter stations is analyzed. The basis of parameter selection of auxiliary converter station and APC converter station is presented due to DC power flow distribution and maximum and minimum operational mode. Finally, simulations in PSCAD/EMTDC are conducted to validate the multi-point DC voltage control method under various operating state in normal, master converter station fault and auxiliary converter station fault conditions respectively. Results show that this method can guarantee the active power allocation of VSC-MTDC transmission system and good control effects are obtained. Â© 2014 IEEE.

TI  - Numerical modeling and analysis of the dynamic motion response of an offshore wind turbine blade during installation by a jack-up crane vessel
AB  - Jack-up crane vessels are commonly used to install offshore wind turbine blades and other components. A jack-up crane vessel is subjected to wind and wave loads, which cause motion at crane tip. Excessive motion at crane tip can lead to failure of lifting operations. Therefore, the crane tip motion should be properly assessed for jack-up crane vessels. In this study, a fully coupled model is developed for a typical elevated jack-up crane vessel, considering the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loads on the vessel, the soil-structure interaction, and the structural flexibility of the jack-up legs and crane. The vessel model developed is further coupled with the SIMO-Aero code to achieve a fully coupled aero-hydro-soil-elastic-mechanical code SIMO-RIFLEX-Aero for numerical modeling and dynamic analysis of offshore single blade installation using jack-up crane vessels. The SIMO-RIFLEX-Aero code is then applied to study the dynamic response of the DTU 10 MW wind turbine blade installed by a typical jack-up crane vessel under various wind and wave conditions. The results show that significant motion is induced at crane tip, mainly due to wave loads. It is important to consider the structural flexibility of the jack-up legs and crane when modeling the installation of offshore wind turbine blades. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - New Control Concept for Offshore Wind Power Plants: Constant-Speed Turbines on a Grid with Variable Frequency
AB  - By using a permanent magnet induction machine as wind generator, the gearbox and converter can be omitted, and the total number of parts reduced leading to a low maintenance and reliable turbine for offshore application. The rotation speed of the turbine however cannot be matched to the wind speed, reducing the energy yield at part load. To overcome this drawback, a central converter can be used, which adjusts the frequency of the local grid in the wind park; this is the so-called park-variable concept. This concept has been compared with respect to energy yield with constant speed and variable speed turbines. Overall, the differences in energy yield of the investigated concepts are so small that other criteria, such as reliability or cost, may be relevant for the selection of one or the other approach. Above all, the park-variable concept represents an interesting alternative to today's common concepts. Â© 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Reliability-based calibration of partial safety factors for the horizontal axis tidal turbine standard for certification
AB  - Tidal energy is nowadays one of the fastest growing types of marine renewable energy. In particular, horizontal axis tidal turbines (HATT) are the most advanced designs and the most appropriate for standardisation. It is however, in the interest of the industry to provide a set of standard practises in order to help in the process of designing this type of marine converters. DNV GL is producing this standard with the support of Alstom and as part of the ReDAPT project commissioned and cofunded by the ETI (Energy Technologies Institute). The work undertaken by DNV GL to produce this standard involves the identification of the uncertainties that designers need to address during the design process. Unlike other marine structures, HATTs are usually located in very energetic areas where no other marine structure has been before. Site characterisation is one of the largest sources of uncertainty e.g. turbulence. Key inputs like turbine inflow conditions or predictions of extreme values are still grey areas due to the limited site measurements and the uncertainty of the metocean models. Numerical models of HATTs are still quite uncertain often dependent on experience of the people running them. As part of ReDAPT project there is an ongoing effort in validation and evaluation of the accuracy of these numerical models and some of the results are used in this calibration study. The new standard for HATTs deals with the loading uncertainty in a whole new way by introducing a new parameter that is added to the traditional partial safety factors for loads. This new standard uses the traditional safety factors from the offshore structures standards and allows changing them based on the level of uncertainty that was introduced during the design process. This paper describes the process of calibration of the partial safety factors in ULS for loads of HATTs that was part of the work in the creation of the new standard. The reliability based calibration involved the formulation of failure criteria, the identification of stochastic variables in the failure criteria, calculation of reliability against failure and ultimately the new set of partial safety factors for loads and a methodology for adjustment of the factors in a case by case basis.

TI  - Wave-Activated Body Energy Converter Technologies: A Review
AB  - Ocean wave could convert the resource energy more than half of its potential capacity often over time, compared with wind or solar system, which is less than half of its capacity resource. However, the challenge rises on designing an ocean wave-capturing device that can achieve optimum efficiency. This paper addressed several topics including the overview of existing technology of wave energy converter with emphasis on wave-activated body category, current principle of energy harnessing, types of generators utilised to harness the wave energy and the current technologies of power electronics implemented to ocean wave devices. Wave energy converters (WEC) that are commercialised, under testing and still in prototype stage are all listed and divided into two different categories, namely, submerged and floating on the sea. The results reveal that, compared with submerged WECs, the floating WECs gain more attention for development. The key factor in choosing a float on device is to consider the fabrication cost, environmental impact especially for marine life, design and maintenance issue, installation site and the selection of power take-off system.

TI  - Probabilistic analysis of monopile-supported offshore wind turbine in clay
AB  - The dynamic behaviour of monopile supported offshore wind turbines (OWTs) is considerably influenced by inherent variabilities of soil properties and loading. This study investigates the effect of uncertainties in soil shear strength properties, and wind and wave loads on the reliability of OWT structures founded in clay. The OWT system is modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam and soil-structure interaction is incorporated using the American Petroleum Institute based cyclic p-y relationships. The uncertainties in soil undrained shear strength, in the parameters and equations of the p-y method, and in wind velocity are considered. Random wave loads are estimated from the code specified power spectral density function of the vertical sea surface elevation. Uncertainties in OWT responses are quantified using Monte Carlo simulations. The effects of length and diameter of the monopile, vertical sea surface displacement spectrum, and the probability distribution of wind speed on the dynamic responses of OWT are investigated. The study shows that the various power spectral density functions of wave surface displacement and various probability density functions of wind speed have a marginal effect on the response and fatigue life of OWTs. The mean fundamental frequency of the OWT system is significantly affected by the variability of the undrained shear strength of clayey soil. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Probabilistic fatigue analysis of jacket support structures for offshore wind turbines exemplified on tubular joints
AB  - The design of offshore wind turbines is usually based on the semi-probabilistic safety concept. Using probabilistic methods, the aim is to find an advanced structural design of OWTs in order to improve safety and reduce costs. The probabilistic design is exemplified on tubular joints of a jacket substructure. Loads and resistance are considered by their respective probability distributions. Time series of loads are generated by fully-coupled numerical simulation of the offshore wind turbine. Especially the very high stress ranges that rarely occur during a period with constant conditions are decisive for the fatigue design. The peak-over-threshold method is applied to find the probability distribution of the very high stress ranges. The method of maximum-likelihood estimation is used to determine the parameters of the underlying generalized Pareto distribution. Further analysis shows that especially the number of the very high stress ranges, scattering for different time series, has a significant impact on the resulting fatigue damage. Â© 2015 The Authors.

TI  - Dynamic Phasor-based Stability Analysis of Multi-Terminal VSC-HVDC Links with Offshore AC Networks
AB  - The paper proposes the stability analysis of an off-shore wind power plant connected to an onshore AC grid through high voltage AC (HVAC) and multi-terminal high voltage DC (MTDC) transmission systems. Dynamic phasor (DP) technique is used to derive the small-signal model of the entire system and to analyze the system with sufficient accuracy and relatively lower computation cost. The DP modeling accounts for the voltage source converter (VSC) models, inner current controller, outer voltage controller, and droop controllers. The impact of the variation of the frequency droop gain, voltage droop gain and line inductance values on the system stability is studied by performing an eigenvalue analysis of the combined system. Simulations in MATLAB/Simulink are used to validate the DP-based analysis of VSC-HVDC systems for offshore wind farm applications.

TI  - Vibration-assisted installation and decommissioning of a slip-joint
AB  - The structural failure of grouted connections for offshore wind turbines focused the industrial attention towards different and innovative solutions to guarantee a safe connection between the monopile foundation and the turbine tower. An alternative option to the traditional grouted joint is a direct steel-to-steel connection, also called a slip-joint which was sporadically used for onshore wind turbines. To such regard, a proof of concept is illustrated concerning a new installation and decommissioning technique of a slip-joint. The key aspect of the proposed method is to guarantee a proper fit and sound contact of the slip-joint by means of vibration-assisted settlements. Therefore, the effectiveness of applying a harmonic excitation during the installation and decommissioning procedure is experimentally investigated using a 1:10 scaled model of the slip-joint. During the dynamic tests, the applied static load and the settlements of the joint are monitored using load cells, displacement sensors and strain gauges placed both inside and outside the conical surfaces. For the installation tests, the results show that settlement occurs when applying a harmonic load at specific forcing frequencies. All the vibration-induced settlements tend to stabilize in time, indicating that a sound contact through vibration-assisted installation can be achieved. In a similar way, the decommissioning proved to be effective at certain forcing frequencies. According to all the tests performed during this experimental campaign, both the installation and decommissioning tests showed to be more sensitive to the forcing frequency rather than to the dynamic forcing amplitude.

TI  - A Generalized Framework for Risk-Based Extreme Load Analysis in Offshore System Design
AB  - The primary aim of this research is to consider the correlation among environmental factors in calculating 100 and 1000 years of extreme load design criteria. This is done by considering load as energy transferred from external environment to the offshore system. Also, incorporating spatial and temporal dependence of environmental variables in the context of offshore design. A bivariate extreme value distribution and a conditional joint return level function are developed using the Gumbelâ€“Hougaard copula. The offshore design risk criteria are developed for the finer grid locations (0.1 deg Ã— 0.1 deg latitude/longitude grid) considering joint extreme wind and wave energy. The developed approach is tested using data for the Flemish Pass basin off the east coast of Canada. Along with the primary aim, the impact of climate change is investigated (time and space variability) by implementing the proposed methodology in two cases: the periods from 1959 to 1988 and 1989 to 2018. This study observed that climate change has caused 30% less correlation between wind speed and wave height in recent years (1989â€“2018) compared to the period of 1959â€“1988. The proposed extreme design wind speed is 39.7 m/s, and significant wave height is 16.4 m; their joint exceeding probability is 5.80 Ã— 10âˆ’5 over an annual basis for a scenario of 100-year.

TI  - Kuroshio power plant development plan
AB  - As a country lacking energy reserves. Taiwan imports 99.2\% of its energy, with only a small portion of indigenous energy, such as hydro, wind, and solar. In 2008, each Taiwanese spent 85,000 NTD dollars (1 USD similar to 32 NTD) to purchase oil, coal, gas, and nuclear fuel from foreign countries, accounting for a total payment of 1.8 trillion NTD, more than the annual budget of the Taiwan government of 1.7 trillion NTD. In the same year, Taiwan emitted about 1\% of the world's greenhouse gas (GHG), or 12 tons per person-year, ranking 18th globally. These situations in terms of energy security and carbon emission are very severe. To resolve these severe situations, harnessing the power of the Kuroshio in eastern Taiwan offers a great opportunity. The Kuroshio is a branch of the North Pacific Ocean current. Due to the westward-enhanced effect, this ocean current is strong and stable as it passes through eastern Taiwan. The flow rate is about 30 sverdrup (Sv) or 1000 times that of the Yangtze River, the average speed is 1 m/s, the flow direction is fixed to the north, and the flow path is close to the east coast of Taiwan. By precisely locating high-quality sites and implementing sequential works with careful planning, one can possibly generate exploitable power more than 30 GW. With 30 GW of clean energy, Taiwan could effectively enhance energy security, reduce GHG emission, and lower energy-purchasing cost. This paper proposes a feasibility study to explore the power of the Kuroshio. The content consists of four parts: (1) assessment of Kuroshio power reserves, (2) development of turbine generators, (3) development of turbine-anchor system, and (4) deep-sea marine engineering of turbine clusters. By integrating these technologies above, we propose a project to construct a 30 MW pilot plant. In this project, we also discuss the financial analysis and propose new regulations, environmental impact analysis, risk assessment, and other relevant issues. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A high-resolution assessment of wind and wave energy potentials in the Red Sea
AB  - This study presents an assessment of the potential for harvesting wind and wave energy from the Red Sea based on an 18-year high-resolution regional atmospheric reanalysis recently generated using the Advanced Weather Research Forecasting model. This model was initialized with ERA-Interim global data and the Red Sea reanalysis was generated using a cyclic three-dimensional variational approach assimilating available data in the region. The wave hindcast was generated using WAVEWATCH III on a 5-km resolution grid, forced by the Red Sea reanalysis surface winds. The wind and wave products were validated against data from buoys, scatterometers and altimeters. Our analysis suggests that the distribution of wind and wave energy in the Red Sea is inhomogeneous and is concentrated in specific areas, characterized by various meteorological conditions including weather fronts, mesoscale vortices, land and sea breezes and mountain jets. A detailed analysis of wind and wave energy variation was performed at three hotspots representing the northern, central and southern parts of the Red Sea. Although there are potential sites for harvesting wind energy from the Red Sea, there are no potential sites for harvesting wave energy because wave energy in the Red Sea is not strong enough for currently available wave energy converters. Wave energy should not be completely ignored, however, at least from the perspective of hybrid wind-wave projects. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - E.ON bets big on coal
AB  - E.ON has launched a companywide technology initiative that includes plans to build the world's most modern coal-fired power station. The claim is a reference to the COMTES 700 project, which is testing materials for a new ultrasupercritical pulverized coal plant design. COMTES 700 is a European Union-funded component testing program installed at E.ON's Scholven 676-Mw coal-fired power plant in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. The COMTES test program is scheduled to be completed in 2009. E.ON will start building the power station in 2010. Then, the company would come the tougher task of capturing and sequestering the plant's CO2 emissions. E.ON also is a partner in the DOE's FutureGen project for gasifying coal, generating hydrogen, and electricity, and capturing and sequestering CO2. E.ON is also interested in boosting renewable energy, particularly offshore wind and biogas. It will focus on deep-water wind farms, which are particularly challenging in terms of design and materials. The company will have 500 Mw of wind capacity installed off the German coast by 2011 and the 200-Mw Rodsand 2 offshore wind farm in Denmark running by 2010. E.ON has already about 700 Mw of installed biogas generation, mostly in small plants.

TI  - Analysis of cavitation for the optimized design of hydrokinetic turbines using BEM
AB  - Hydrokinetic turbines are a promising technology for renewable energy production from river, tidal and marine currents. This paper proposes an innovative approach applied to optimization of horizontal axis hydrokinetic turbines (HAHTs) considering the possibility of cavitation. The minimum pressure coefficient is the criterion used for identifying cavitation on blades. Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory is employed for the rotor design. During the optimization procedure, chord length at each blade section is corrected by a modification on the local thrust coefficient in order to prevent cavitation. The hydraulic parameters as lift, drag and minimum pressure coefficients are calculated by XFoil. Additionally, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques are used to validate the proposed methodology. Cavitation volume in the water flow through the rotor, with and without geometrical modifications, is evaluated using a Reynolds Averaged Navierâ€“Stokes (RANS) approach coupled to the Rayleigh-Plesset model to estimate the vapor production rate. The methodology is applied to the design of a 10 m diameter Hydrokinetic Turbine (HT) rated to 250 kW output power, for a flow velocity of 2.5 m/s. The flow around the optimized rotor presents a reduction of the vapor volume without a major variation upon the turbine output power. A comparison with the Horizontal Axis Rotor Performance Optimization (HARP_opt) code was carried out, demonstrating good behavior. CFD simulations revealed that the proposed design method minimizes cavitation inception, yielding a useful tool for efficient HT design at rated conditions. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Atmospheric stability affects wind turbine power in large offshore wind farms
AB  - With the rapid development of offshore wind power industry, it is significant to improve the accuracy of offshore wind energy assessment. Sea surface roughness and atmospheric thermal stability are main factors that influence the offshore wind energy. But at present, most researches on micro-scale aerodynamic field of wind farms are based on neutral atmospheric condition, few takes thermal stability into account; also, sea surface roughness is often set as a constant, which reduces the accuracy of offshore wind energy assessment. This paper researches the thermal stability of an offshore wind farm in Jiangsu Province, gives a suitable way to decide thermal stability for offshore wind farms. Also, it analyzes variation of output power of the turbines in a column under different thermal conditions, with roughness into account, to consider their impact on offshore wind farms. The result shows that when roughness is big enough, thermal stability has little influence on output power; while sea surface roughness is small enough, thermal stability has a dominant influence on output power.

TI  - Integration of wind farm to VSC-HVDC system
AB  - Renewable energy resources are playing an important role in reducing the energy crisis. One of the important resources is being wind energy systems. Most of the times, offshore wind power is transferred to the main land grid through VSC-HVDC transmission system due to its advantages. As converters are required for transmission of offshore power, their control mechanism takes a major control overpower transmission. In this work a power system is proposed, wherein a high penetration no storage wind diesel isolated system (HPNSWD) is interconnected to an existing VSC-HVDC system, in order to enhance the power transfer capability of a 200KV, 500MW VSC-HVDC system.

TI  - Empowering sustainable niches: Comparing UK and Dutch offshore wind developments
AB  - Offshore wind has been positioned as a promising technology that could play a major role in moving towards more sustainable energy systems, but deployment varies significantly across countries. This article aims to explain the contrast between the boom in the UK versus stagnation in The Netherlands, by analysing the niche empowerment dynamics building on Smith and Raven's (2012) distinction between `fit and conform' and `stretch and transform' strategies. Analysis focuses on the actor networks and the narratives they use to enrol support for the deployment of the technology. We conclude that because the narratives mobilised are quite similar in both cases, an explanation must lie with the actors. We argue that the UK's relative success is partly the result of the presence of a proactive `system builder' in the form of the Crown Estate which plays a central role in powerful public-private actor networks around offshore wind. We also conclude that the Smith and Raven `protected space' framework fails to capture how different national institutional settings shape the possibilities for empowering work of technology advocates as our analysis shows that despite the highly international nature of the offshore wind sector, attempts by multi-national companies result in different outcomes in different countries.

TI  - Design of a High-Power Resonant Converter for DC Wind Turbines
AB  - This paper presents a design procedure and loss estimation for a high-power, medium-voltage series resonant converter (entitled SRC#), intended for application in megawatt medium-voltage dc wind turbines. The converter is operated with a novel method of operation, entitled pulse removal technique, characterized by variable frequency and phase-shift modulation, below the resonant point of the LC tank. A step-by-step design procedure is proposed and circuit component ratings and efficiency are compared for two variants. The new method of operation reduces transformer size to below 50%, whereas losses are kept below 1.5% from zero to nominal power, due to soft-switching characteristics. An experimental setup, rated for 10 kW and 5 kV output was assembled to extract losses and validate the semiconductor loss model. Â© 1986-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Investigations into Balancing Peak-to-Average Power Ratio and Mean Power Extraction for a Two-Body Point-Absorber Wave Energy Converter
AB  - The power harnessed by wave energy converters (WECs) in oceans is highly variable and, therefore, has a high peak-to-average power (PTAP) ratio. To minimize the cost of a WEC power take off (PTO) system, it is desirable to reduce the PTAP ratio while maximizing the mean power extracted by WECs. The important issue of how PTAP ratio reduction measures (such as adding an inertia element) can affect the mean power extracted in a reference model has not been thoroughly addressed in the literature. To investigate this correlation, this study focuses on the integration of the U.S. Department of Energy's Reference Model 3, a two-body point absorber, with a slider-crank WEC for linear-to-rotational conversion. In the first phase of this study, a full-scale numerical model was developed that predicts how PTO system parameters, along with an advanced control algorithm, can potentially affect the proposed WEC's PTAP ratio as well as the mean power extracted. In the second phase, an appropriate scaled-down model was developed, and extracted power results were successfully validated against the full-scale model. Finally, numerical and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations based on the scaled-down model were designed and conducted to optimize or make trade-offs between the operational performance and PTAP ratio. The initial results with numerical and HIL simulations reveal that gear ratio, crank radius, and generator parameters substantially impact the PTAP ratio and mean power extracted.

TI  - Stalling-Free control strategies for oscillating-water-column-based wave power generation plants
AB  - The rising use of renewable power generation plants is highlighting the need for an integrated research combining multiple disciplines in order to achieve a commercially competitive technology stage. The demonstrative NEREIDA wave power plant installed in the northern coast of Spain constitutes a good example of this effort. This paper deals with the design, modeling, and control of the oscillating-water-column-based wave energy converter in order to maximize the power output of the NEREIDA power plant. The power optimization relies on two control strategies proposed to avoid the stalling behavior, a characteristic drawback of the Wells turbine, which limits the system's power. The first control strategy is an airflow control using a PID controller tuned by the particle swarm optimization algorithm and its recent memetic variant called fractional particle swarm optimization memetic algorithm. This controller will control a throttle valve to regulate the airflow in the turbine duct. The second one consist of adequately controlling the rotational speed of the generator by means of the rotor-side converter of the back-To-back converter connected to the doubly fed induction generator to provide a swift way to respond to the rapid variations in the turbine speed. The results show that both controls provide a higher power generation compared to the uncontrolled case. Â© 2017 IEEE.

TI  - Norsewind offshore remote sensing: First results from lidar deployments on oil/gas rigs and other platforms in the north sea
AB  - In the EU project NORSEWInD, in-situ offshore wind measurements are currently performed by LiDAR remote sensing (RS) techniques. A number of 5 (from about 15 scheduled) individual LiDAR wind profilers have already been deployed during late summer/autumn 2009 on offshore platforms in the North Sea to collect high quality wind data over a period of 2 years. The paper reports (1) important technical experiences with actual installations of LiDARs on un-manned platforms and (2) presents initial results from collected wind speed and direction data at various heights, serving as input to different NORSEWInD modelling work packages. NORSEWInD is an EU project that will provide cost effective, high quality offshore wind speed data. For the purpose of the project, the areas being investigated are the Irish Sea, Baltic Sea and North Sea, areas where the greatest economic expansion of offshore wind energy will take place. The project will combine Lidar remote sensing and satellite techniques as well as classic met mast measurements to provide a high quality, hub height data set covering the whole of the North, Irish and Baltic Seas. One of its objectives is to demonstrate the approach of a basin wide acquisition of the offshore wind field for wind energy purposes such as wind resource assessments by in-situ measurements on various offshore rigs and platforms in the different Seas. For this remote sensing (RS) techniques such as Wind-LiDAR and SoDAR will be used. On the order of 15 individual RS systems will be deployed on various offshore platforms in the North, Irish and Baltic Seas to collect data over a continuous period of 2 year. About five of those systems (LiDAR) profilers have already been deployed during late summer/autumn 2009 on offshore platforms in the North Sea to collect high quality wind data over a period of 2 years. The paper reports firstly on important findings and technical experiences regarding the actual installations of LiDARs on un-manned platforms. The main focus is on the initial results from wind speed and direction time series collected by LiDAR profilers at various mesurement levels. In the course of the NORSEWInD project those data will serve as input e.g. into the modelling work packages as well as for comparison studies regarding satellite and classical cup/mast measurements.

TI  - Experimental study of grouting protection against local scouring of monopile foundations for offshore wind turbines
AB  - Local scouring is a severe threat to the safety of offshore wind turbines, and it cannot be eliminated completely by traditional protection methods. In this paper, to improve seabed scouring resistance, a new local scouring countermeasure-grouting protection-is proposed, and flume scouring tests are reported. It is found that after grouting, the micro-morphological characteristics of the soil are changed, with the internal friction angle and cohesion of the seabed soil being improved significantly. The grouted seabed has different modes during the development of scouring, i.e., cracking, peeling off, incipient motion, and abrasion. Further analysis shows that the critical shear stress of grouted seabed particles is much greater than that of ungrouted ones, and the ultimate scouring depth of grouted seabed is much lower than that of ungrouted seabed. The protective effect of grouting on local scouring is fully verified: compared with collar protection, grouting protection is more reliable under weak hydrodynamic action, and compared with riprap protection, grouting protection is more efficient under extreme hydrodynamic action.

TI  - Current source converter series tapping of a LCC-HVDC transmission system for integration of offshore wind power plants
AB  - When using HVDC there are two available commercial possibilities: Transmissions based on Line Commutated Converters (LCC) and based on Voltage Source Converters (VSC). VSC-HVDC is more suitable for creating offshore grids. Despite this fact, many LCC transmission systems are in operation across the sea interconnecting mainlands or islands. This work addresses the concept of connecting wind power plants in series with an LCC-HVDC transmission link already built by means of a self-commutating Current Source Converter (CSC). The idea is similar to series tapping stations which can extract power form the HVDC link. Nevertheless, a CSC can act as a rectifier or inverter, so power reversal is available and has the same advantages of a VSC. The coupling between LCC stations and the CSC is straightforward since both topologies are current source converters. The control and operation of the system under normal conditions is presented and verified by means of simulations using MATLAB Simulink.

TI  - Fault ride through and grid support topology for the VSC-HVDC connected offshore wind farms
AB  - Voltage source converter (VSC) based high voltage direct current (HVdc) transmission draws more attention in recent years for the grid connection of large-scale offshore wind farms (WF). This paper proposes nine switch converter (NSC) based configuration and control strategy for the VSC-HVdc connected offshore WFs to enhance the fault ride through operation of the system. The configuration allows having both shunt and series interfaces to the onshore grid, which allows the isolation of the faulty part of the network, continuous power delivery to the healthy portion, and significant reduction of the fault current. Reduced switch count NSC is utilized at the onshore station to provide simultaneous shunt and series compensation to the electric grid. The proposed control strategy ensures full power evacuation and the dc-link voltage regulation during network disturbances. The comparative analysis between the proposed and conventional VSC-HVdc systems carried out in MATLAB/ Simulink environment revealed the former's enhanced transient performance. Â© 2016 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper a review of common wind turbine systems and wind farm configurations with AC and DC links is presented first, and then a new structure based on HVDC local grid is proposed and compared to the existing structures to show its effectiveness with respect to the older ones. The most important feature of the new structure is its lower cost, while it preserves controllability of the most flexible configurations like DFIG-based wind farms or wind farms with PMSG generators and back-to-back converters. The other feature of the proposed structure is its high efficiency, which is due to the use of direct driven multi-pole synchronous generators.

AB  - This study proposes an alternative method for integrating an offshore wind farm into the conventional alternating current (AC) power network. The output power port of wind farm consists of a direct current (DC) collector . The offshore wind farm is integrated with a photovoltaic (PV) source and a battery storage system (BSS). The BSS and PV are needed for counteracting the intermittent power generation from offshore wind farm. The conventional AC power network consists largely of AC loads including few DC loads which are fed through the power converters. It is true that the power converters are the main sources of voltage/current harmonic distortion into the power system, thus affecting significantly the power quality. In this study, an interconnected AC and DC power networks is considered, which feed power separately to AC and low-voltage DC loads. The interchange of power between high-voltage DC link and low-voltage DC loads is facilitated through an automatic adapter. The technical concept of the automatic adapter is introduced in this chapter. The interchange of power between the AC and DC networks is facilitated through a bidirectional ACâ€“DC voltage source converter (VSC). The proposed distributed power network topology reduces the need for large number of power converter into the conventional AC power network to feed DC loads, thus reducing the presence of voltage/current harmonic or ripple and also improving the AC network efficiency. Details of operation of the proposed distributed power network topology is analysed and discussed. The mechanism to control the active and reactive power is clearly explained. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed power network topology, intensive simulations are carried out using the Power Simulator (PSim) software. Â© Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

TI  - Development of a prototype autonomous inspection robot for offshore riser cables
AB  - The motion and large environmental loads experienced by riser cables connected to floating offshore wind turbines put them at higher risk of failure than grounded sections of cable. We propose an Autonomous Riser Inspection System (ARIS) to facilitate regular inspection of riser cables for early fault detection and gathering engineering data to improve future cable design. Novel robotic methods for automatic attachment, traversal and inspection of cables are described. We develop the sensing and intelligent processing needed to (i) enable autonomous traversal and position estimation, and (ii) gather information about the state and condition of riser cables. Information from an array of cameras and electric actuator current monitoring allows autonomous navigation around obstacles and identifying the end of the inspection. A visual processing algorithm identifies damage to the surface of the cable and sensing methods are developed to measures the cable catenary, where methods to estimate the robot's position along the cable are developed to contextualise and efficiently re-locate observations. Technology concepts are verified through a combination of dry, lab-based experiments using a full-scale prototype and simulations. The results provide proof of concept that requirements for untethered, autonomous riser cable inspection can be met by the proposed system. Â© 2022 The Authors

TI  - Offshore wind farms: Potential and applicability in the Southern Marmara Region, Turkey
AB  - In this study, applicability of offshore wind energy conversion systems in the Southern Marmara Region has been investigated. For this purpose, four different regions were selected and wind properties of the regions were assessed. Selected regions have been analyzed by taking into account the wind data measured as mean daily time series. The wind data used in this study has been taken from Meteorological Data Archive and Management System of Turkish State Meteorological Service (TUMASTSMS). As a first step for the deployment of offshore wind farms in Turkey, the wind energy potential along the southern Marmara shoreline has been assessed. Combined with the regions wave climate properties and bathymmetrical features, suitable locations for offshore wind energy farms are recommended. The outcome indicates that the regions surrounding Kapidag Peninsula can be used to deploy offshore wind turbine systems.

TI  - Design and development of subsea power and instrumentation system for new ocean current turbine power module
AB  - The ocean current energy is one of the clean forms of available renewable energy sources. Based on the topography of the islands, the subsea current is comparatively more than the mainland. Most of the islands are not having self-sustained power sources due to the limitations of infrastructure even though the power requirement is less. The National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) of Ministry of Earth Sciences has undertaken the research and development of an ocean current power module for such islands. The first prototype ocean current turbine (OCT) power module was tested at Macpherson Strait in the Andaman open sea. The subsea power module of the system comprises of the turbine, transmission system, generator and the associated power and instrumentation systems. The development and implementation of electrical and instrumentation system for an underwater OCT power module are one of the challenging task, hence the entire system required to be designed for in- situ conditions. This paper aims to describe the design of Power take off (PTO) system, data acquisition, and wireless communication of prototype ocean current power module trials in open sea conditions.

TI  - HOMER Optimized Off-grid Hybrid Energy System: A Case Study on Rohingya Relocation Center in Bangladesh
AB  - The use of fossil fuels in generating energy is not only depleting these fixed resources at a higher pace but also has enormous negative impact on the environment. In this scenario, using renewable energy to design hybrid generation systems is both cost optimizing and environment-friendly. This paper carries a detailed study of a renewable energy-based electrification scheme for a Rohingya Relocation Center, an isolated island named Bhasan Char with sensitivity analysis of the proposed system. Using HOMER (Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables), a hybrid system is designed which contains a combination of the wind turbine, solar PV modules, microturbine generators, converter, and battery.

TI  - Global renewable energy resources and use in 2050
AB  - The main forms of renewable energy (RE) used today are biomass energy, hydroelectricity, wind energy, solar energy, and geothermal energy. Although several other RE sources have been extensively discussed, including various forms of ocean energy, these five are likely to still be dominant in 2050. In assessing the probable future of each RE type, it is important to know what factors will tend to enhance or decrease their future output. These include: their energy return on input energy; their technical potential; the impacts that future land use, climate, and other environmental changes will have on their availability; and alternatively, the effects of RE production on the environment.

TI  - Failure analysis and risk management of a collapsed large wind turbine tower
AB  - Developing renewable energy is crucial as nations face the twin threats of global warming and a reduction in energy supplies. Wind turbines are one of the most promising sources of renewable energy in Taiwan. However, on September 28, 2008, Typhoon Jangmi struck Taiwan, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall that collapsed a wind turbine tower located on the shore of Taichung Harbor. This study provides significant insights into, and lessons learned from, post-disaster inspection into the causes of tower failure during this typhoon. This event represented the first time that a wind turbine in Taiwan that had to be reconstructed after collapsing. To prevent similar accidents, the likely causal mechanisms are examined from the risk management perspective. Data for case analysis are collected from original tower design reports, the tower design code, construction records and documents, historical wind-speed data, structural tower analysis, and intact and fractured bolt material tests. Furthermore, similar accidents in other countries and their causes are reviewed to identify potential risk factors affecting the lifecycle of wind turbines. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - An integrated framework of drivetrain degradation assessment and fault localization for offshore wind turbines
AB  - As wind energy proliferates in onshore and offshore applications, it has become significantly important to predict wind turbine downtime and maintain operation uptime to ensure maximal yield. Two types of data systems have been widely adopted for monitoring turbine health condition: supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and condition monitoring system (CMS). Provided that research and development have focused on advancing analytical techniques based on these systems independently, an intelligent model that associates information from both systems is necessary and beneficial. In this paper, a systematic framework is designed to integrate CMS and SCADA data and assess drivetrain degradation over its lifecycle. Information reference and advanced feature extraction techniques are employed to procure heterogeneous health indicators. A pattern recognition algorithm is used to model baseline behavior and measure deviation of current behavior, where a Self-organizing Map (SOM) and minimum quantization error (MQE) method is selected to achieve degradation assessment. Eventually, the computation and ranking of component contribution to the detected degradation offers component-level fault localization. When validated and automated by various applications, the approach is able to incorporate diverse data resources and output actionable information to advise predictive maintenance with precise fault information. The approach is validated on a 3 MW offshore turbine, where an incipient fault is detected well before existing system shuts down the unit. A radar chart is used to illustrate the fault localization result.

TI  - Marine growth effect on the vibration characteristics of offshore wind turbine with jacket foundation
AB  - Due to the energy crisis and greenhouse effect, wind energy is becoming one of the most attractive renewable energies during last three decades. Especially them offshore wind energy gets more attention because it could provide better wind condition with less turbulence and no visual impact and land limitation. Different foundation types could be used for offshore wind turbine. Jacket foundation is regarded as a suitable solution for the intermediate water depth ranging from 30 to 80 meters. on the submerged members of jacket, numerous type of marine fouling organism may be found. They may increase the diameter of the members, change the surface roughness and influence the hydrodynamic loads of structures.

TI  - Added value for integrated marine energy data systems (February 2021)
AB  - Launched in 2019, the Portal and Repository for Information on Marine Renewable Energy (PRIMRE) provides centralized access, standardization, community building, and integration of United States (U.S.) databases, tools and codes, and other resources that cover a range of marine energy information. The PRIMRE universe contains a series of Knowledge Hubs that represent data and information on testing of marine energy devices (MHKDR); environmental effects (Tethys); engineering and technical papers (Tethys Engineering); descriptions of marine energy companies and technologies (Marine Energy Projects Database); codes and models (Marine Energy Software); and guidance on testing and measurements (Telesto). Content is added to PRIMRE by applying a set of Guidelines and Best Practices (PRIMRE Guidelines). An aggregate search across the PRIMRE site enables users to find data and information from all the PRIMRE Knowledge Hubs simultaneously, using a single entry-point (PRIMRE Search). In addition to providing access to a range of data and information on marine energy development, testing, and effects, PRIMRE allows for the development of valueadded products and processes that will help move the marine energy industry forward. The PRIMRE team has recently launched two key initiatives in the U.S.-Signature Projects and Lessons Learned. Outputs and outcomes from these two initiatives will be highlighted in this paper. The Signature Projects initiative is intended to bring focus to a selection of ongoing and completed marine energy projects funded by the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s Water Power Technologies Office (WPTO), and to inform the marine energy community of what investigations have been undertaken, what tools are available, and where gaps in information persist. Each Signature Project tags papers, reports, and data from large marine energy research projects, providing easy access and attention to all the output and associated products from each project. The Lessons Learned initiative is intended to ensure that hard-won achievements are recognized and available for those who come later, that missteps and unfortunate outcomes can be prevented in future, and that efficiencies and effective shortcuts can be publicized and used as the marine energy industry moves forward. This initiative builds off the Knowledge Hubs and reaches out to members of the marine energy community, particularly technology developers and researchers, to integrate experience in the development, deployment, assessment, success, challenges while creating this new industry and field of study.

TI  - An Experimental Comparison between an Ironless and a Traditional Permanent Magnet Linear Generator for Wave Energy Conversion
AB  - Permanent Magnet Linear Generators (PMLGs) are currently being studied for sea wave energy harvesting. Typically, a PMLG consists of an iron-made armature and a moving translator. The permanent magnets adoption produces parasitic effects, such as cogging force, and the machine weight increment. A solution could be the adoption of an ironless configuration, accepting a power density reduction. This paper investigates the use of ironless PMLGs in sea wave energy conversion systems by an experimental comparative analysis between an iron PMLG prototype and an ironless PMLG prototype, which share the same geometry. The main electrical and mechanical parameters (resistance, mass, and magnetic fields) were preliminarily measured. Subsequently, open-circuit and load tests were carried out to compare the induced voltages, the energy transferred to a resistive load, efficiency and the load average power. The reported comparison shows that iron PMLG performances are significantly superior to the ironless ones during the open-circuit tests, as expected. However, the analysis carried out through the load tests shows that the cogging force significantly limits the energy production, obtaining similar values in both machines. Therefore, the experimental tests justify the use of ironless machines in sea wave energy harvesting, where the maximization of energy production is a relevant target. Â© 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Green development strategy of offshore wind farm in China guided by life cycle assessment
AB  - Offshore wind power contributes to the decarbonization of the power system; however, its green development faces many challenges, including environmental impact concerns, scale limitations, and grid parity to go carbon neutral. This study applies life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate the potential environmental impact of China's first high-power prototype windfarm. The environmental impact of the wind farm is more sensitive to steel, copper, and electricity usage. The recycling of waste turbines can be a solution to reduce the environmental impacts of not only the wind farm but also other entities such as metal producers. Overall, this wind farm case can reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by 9.23 MJ and 767.9 g CO2-eq for 1 kWh electricity produced, respectively. Guided by LCA results, green development strategies that include toward the deep sea, promote industrial upgrading and synergy, and advance demonstration projects are discussed in the offshore wind power industry.

TI  - A feasibility study on Balarbhita for advancing rural electrification with a solar-Micro-hydro hybrid system
AB  - The study analyzed the techno-economic feasibility of a village in the Indian state of Assam and designs a framework for a rural hybrid energy system. Through an extensive resource evaluation, techno-economic feasibility analysis and system size optimization are carried out using HOMER Pro software. Batteries are being used as a form of energy storage in the community power system, which is based on solar PV and micro-hydro as its principal energy sources. Macro-economic variables and resource variations have been considered in sensitivity analysis to ensure the robustness and commercial viability of the proposed hybrid energy systems. A reliable and economical design can provide 279861 kWh of electricity for the village at a modest cost of energy (COE) of \$0.0953/kWh using 118 kW of solar power, 11 kW of hydropower, and 261 kWh of battery storage. Furthermore, solar energy systems account for about 62.5 percent, while micro-hydro turbines account for 37.5 percent. In addition, the suggested system does not pollute the local environment caused by carbon emissions. Most importantly, this hybrid energy system is capable of providing 24/7 continuous electricity to the site under consideration.

TI  - Optimal Design of Offshore Wind Power Farm Considering Wind Uncertainty
AB  - This study presents an optimization-based framework for the design of offshore wind power farms (OWFs). First, the main characteristics of the OWF facilities are decided including the size and type of the turbines and the capacity of the inter-array cables. Second, a feasible location for installing the facility is identified by considering various geographical characteristics such as average wind speed and water depth, with the aid of a geographic information system (GIS). Finally, we construct a mixed-integer fractional programming (MIFP) optimization model to decide on the exact locations of the wind turbines and the offshore substations as well as the routes of the inter-array cables, by minimizing the unit cost which is the total installation cost divided by total power generated. A case study is conducted based on the 6th regional energy plan of Jeju island, South Korea, which plans to construct two 100 MW and one 125 MW OWFs. The optimized unit cost of the OWFs turns out to be 2.3 MM$/MW, which is at par with existing OWFs. Furthermore, we introduce a stochastic programming model to consider various potential wind scenarios directly in the design. The robust design obtained via stochastic programming approach showed an improved average unit cost by ~ 5% compared to the nominal design which assumed a specific scenario of wind speed and direction.

TI  - Future wind and solar power market values in Germany â€” Evidence of spatial and technological dependencies?
AB  - Achieving ambitious climate targets entails an extensive utilisation of renewable energy sources. However, due to weather-dependent fluctuations, generation from variable renewable energy (VRE) sources is characterised by significantly lower market values in comparison to conventional technologies, reinforced by a decline in electricity prices. This development poses interesting questions as to its drivers and to what extent market values of wind and solar power can be influenced by the design of electricity markets. Against this background, a scenario-based analysis is conducted to trace the future development of market values using endogenously derived electricity prices considering different regional and technological VRE diversification strategies and investments into VRE technologies on a myopic basis. The results show a continued decline in market values with increasing regional discrepancies indicating a growing importance of interregional interdependencies for assessing the profitability of VRE. Furthermore, from a system point of view, a more distributed allocation of onshore wind capacities to contend with declining market values does not always prove to stabilise market values by facilitating a more constant feed-in pattern, contrary to expectation. Finally, replacing onshore with offshore wind energy appears to be beneficial as it can lead to an overall increase in the market values of offshore, onshore as well as PV generation technologies compared to other mitigation strategies. This result raise interesting questions about the systemic economic value of offshore wind despite its higher LCOE in the context of market integration of VRE. Â© 2020 The Authors

AB  - Given the multiple design variables and cost factors, the cable layout optimization problem for large offshore wind farms is an issue of high complexity. This paper proposes a method for optimizing cable layout based on an improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA). First, the life cycle cost of the cable is taken as the objective function, constraints are presented considering actual engineering requirements, and the optimization model of the cable layout is established. Then, combining the chicken swarm optimization algorithm and the Prim algorithm, the ISSA is proposed to simultaneously optimize the cable connection topology, cable type and substation location of the offshore wind farm. Finally, case studies are carried out to verify the feasibility of the model and the effectiveness of the improved algorithm. The results show that the life cycle model provides a comprehensive assessment of the economics of the cable layout. Compared with the original algorithm, the ISSA has greater ability to find the optimal solution. In addition, compared with the improved algorithms in the literature, the ISSA has a simple structure, high efficiency and strong optimization stability. It is suitable for the optimization of cable layout for offshore wind farms. Â© 2022 Power System Protection and Control Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - For the prediction of offshore wind power, the traditional wind power prediction models seldom take into account the difference in output power caused by the changes in wind directions and atmospheric conditions. In order to improve the prediction accuracy, this paper constructs a power-direction model based on wind directions and power losses while considering the atmospheric stability, and proposes an offshore wind power prediction method based on the encoder-decoder framework. This method can update the wake effect losses according to the Pd model, effectively suppress the predicted power fluctuation, and distinguish the wake effects under different atmospheric stratification stabilities. First, the prediction models like the long-short term memory (LSTM) neural network are used to verify the atmospheric stability and the effectiveness of the Pd model. Then, the encoder-decoder is used to predict the wind power of the actual offshore wind farm. The experimental results show that the encoder-decoder method, which considers the atmospheric stability and uses the Pd model, has a 2.39% lower root mean square error than that of a single encoder-decoder prediction method.

TI  - Comprehensive study of wind supercharged solar chimney power plant combined with seawater desalination
AB  - In this study, a model of wind supercharged solar chimney power plant combined with seawater desalination (WSSCPPCSD) was proposed. The integrated system was divided into wind pressure ventilator and solar chimney power generation system for numerical simulation. Three-dimensional unsteady state numerical investigation on wind pressure ventilator was carried out as well as steady state numerical study on the solar chimney power generation system. The flow field characteristics and performance parameters of the two subsystems were analyzed. Subsequently, the comparison between solar chimney power plant (SCPP), solar chimney power plant combined with seawater desalination (SCPPCSD) and WSSCPPCSD was conducted. The results show that, although SCPPCSD can greatly improve the solar energy comprehensive utilization, the power generation is reduced. The wind pressure ventilator proposed in this paper could not only significantly increase the power generation but also increase the freshwater production by providing a negative pressure of 64.5 Pa at the chimney outlet. It was found that at 800 W/m2, an increase in power output of about 14.7 kW and increase in hourly freshwater production of 30 g/h were obtained. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF A SMALL SCALE OCEAN CURRENT AND WAVE ENERGY CONVERTER
AB  - The inability to tie into the electrical power grid drives mariners to search for alternative energy sources. One such alternative energy source is to harness the vast supply of kinetic and potential energies associated with ocean currents and waves. In the Ocean Current and Wave Energy Converter, a tandem system of an underwater turbine and a wave energy buoy is designed to provide power to a standard 12 volt marine battery. Subsurface energy in the form of current flow is harvested by a helical cross-flow Gorlov turbine. Kinetic surface wave energy is harnessed through an inertial mass system. This system utilizes a 360, bidirectional, rotating mass enclosed in a spherical buoy that converts the pitching motion into rotational motion. Both subsystems are integrated together through the charging circuit. The charging system is designed to integrate multiple energy sources to maximize the total energy harnessed. Through testing and analysis, design improvements are identified and it is determined that the design of a small scale current flow and wave energy conversion system is a feasible solution to providing power from the ocean.

TI  - Untangling global levelised cost of electricity based on multi-factor learning curve for renewable energy: Wind, solar, geothermal, hydropower and bioenergy
AB  - Renewable energy offers a less expensive source of electricity globally for the energy sector's transformation towards a sustainable energy system. This paper untangles the driving mechanism behind the global renewable energy levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) development for seven promising renewable energy technologies from 2010 to 2018: onshore wind, offshore wind, solar photovoltaic, concentrating solar power (CSP), geothermal, hydropower and bioenergy. This research provides a comprehensive and repeatable version of multi-factor learning curve (MFLC) method based on a cost minimization approach, Cobb-Douglas function and engineering analysis to analyze factors affecting the renewable power generation cost. Capacity factors are highlighted as the indicators for natural resource volatility and technology progress. The modified MFLC models show that capacity factor effect, installed cost effect and learning effect are the main drivers of cost reduction. Rapidly declining wind and solar costs are driven by the competitive installed costs and upgraded technology in areas with excellent natural wind and solar resources. The irregular cost movements of geothermal, hydropower and bioenergy are heavily influenced by the site-specific characteristics of these projects, reflecting the high natural resource volatility and diversity in capital across regions.

TI  - Model Prediction Control Scheme of Wind Farm with Energy Storage for Frequency Support
AB  - The flexible control characteristic of energy storage system makes it have an advantage in participating in grid frequency regulation. The combination of wind power and energy storage has the effect of synergistic enhancement in providing frequency support. However, traditional PID controllers are difficult to achieve coordinated control of wind farms and energy storage. To address this issue, a model predictive control (MPC) based scheme of wind farm with energy storage system for frequency support is proposed. The MPC controller optimizes the power reference for each offshore wind turbine as well as the energy storage system, with the objective of minimizing the grid frequency deviation. In the MPC design, power constraints for wind turbines that adapt various wind speeds are considered, thereby ensuring the stable operation of wind turbines during the frequency support. Meanwhile, state of charge (SoC) constraints for the energy storage system is also proposed to extend its life. What's more, the moving horizon estimation (MHE) is introduced to estimate the grid power imbalance. The results show that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the performance of the grid frequency. Â© 2021 IEEE.

TI  - RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES - UK GOVERNMENT-SUPPORTED R&D.
AB  - The British Government's White Paper The Development of Alternative Sources of Energy of June 1978, announced a research and development program costing nearly POUND 16 million on five separate renewable energy sources - solar, wave, wind, tidal and geothermal. The present expectation is that even those technologies with the greatest long-term potential - solar space heating, wind power and wave power - will prove to be too expensive to consider in the U. K. as anything other than an insurance against possible short-falls in supply from conventional sources. Although research on wave power has evolved designs which indicate the lowering of costs of producing electricity from this source, it has yet to be proved it will be competitive. The greatest potential for wind power is expected to be in offshore siting, but there construction and maintenance costs could be twice those for land or shallow sea sites. Solar space heating is itself at a very early stage of development. These factors add up to suggest that renewable energy sources are unlikely to displace coal or nuclear power sources within the next 50 years.

TI  - Power generation efficiency analysis of offshore wind farms connected to a SLPC (single large power converter) operated with variable frequencies considering wake effects
AB  - This paper deals with the power generation efficiency analysis of a proposed offshore wind farm topology, consisting of a SLPC (single large power converter) that simultaneously controls a group of generators. This common converter can operate at a VF (variable frequency) or at a CF (constant frequency). The results are compared with the conventional onshore wind farm scheme, where individual power converters are connected to each turbine, guaranteeing maximum power generation for the entire wind farm. A methodology to analyze different wind speed and direction scenarios, and to compute the optimal electrical frequency for each one, is presented and applied to different case studies depending on the wind farm size. In order to obtain more realistic values of wind speeds, the wake effect amongst wind turbines is considered. A wake model considering single, partial and multiple wakes inside a wind farm and taking into account different wind directions, is presented. Both wind farm topologies are analyzed by means of simulations, taking into account both wind speed variability in wind farms and the number of wind turbines. The possible resulting benefits of simplifying the MPCs (multiple power converters) of each turbine, namely saving costs, reducing losses and maintenance and increasing the reliability of the system, are analyzed, focusing on the total power extraction. The SLPC-VF scheme is also compared with a CF scheme SLPC-CF, and it is shown that a significant power increase of more than 33% can be obtained with SLPC-VF. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Self-healing strategy for wind turbine condition monitoring system based on wireless sensor networks
AB  - The fault rate of offshore wind turbines is so high that it is necessary to build a reliable condition monitoring system to improve the maintenance efficiency. To adapt to the harsh operating environment of offshore wind turbine, the condition monitoring system should have good self-healing ability. In this paper, the condition monitoring system of offshore wind turbine is built based on wireless sensor network technology. Focusing on the problem of blind monitoring area caused by sensor nodes failure in the monitoring system, a self-healing strategy is proposed for the monitoring system. By adjusting the sensing distance of the nodes, the blind monitoring area of the system can be repaired by itself. Based on the simulation analysis, it can be found that the blind monitoring area can be repaired in time by the self-healing strategy. At the same time, the total energy consumption and the number of redundant nodes of the system can be reduced significantly.

TI  - Increasing the reliability of industrial multi-MW wind turbines
AB  - Although wind turbine gearboxes are designed to remain in-service for 20-25 years, this is not the case since a large number of failures have been reported to occur prematurely. A large number of gearboxes fail after 7 to 8-years in-service. In offshore wind farms gearbox failures have been reported as early as only 1 to 2 years in-service. Hence, wind turbine gearboxes are currently a source of significant reliability issue resulting in noteworthy loss of production and downtime for wind farm operators. Within this paper the quality of the materials used for manufacturing gears and bearings used in industrial wind turbine gearboxes has been evaluated. In addition, the damage mechanisms affecting gears and bearings have been investigated based on metallographic analysis of failed samples removed from in-service industrial wind turbines. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) has been carried out in order to simulate damage initiation and propagation in gear and bearing materials under inservice conditions. The results have been compared with those obtained from the failed samples retrieved from the field. Finally, an integrated condition monitoring methodology based on the use of online oil sensors coupled with vibration analysis and acoustic emission for the reliable evaluation of wind turbine gearboxes is presented.

TI  - Wind turbine productivity and development in Iran
AB  - This paper presents an overview of the status of wind energy productivity and development issues in Iran. It also presents a summary of the present global work on offshore energy, including the most recent works as well as potential offshore wind energy resource in Iran. The positive impacts of wind energy on the mitigation of climate change as well as opportunity to diminish energy dependency are indisputable. Wind energy helps decreasing import dependency, diversifying sources of production, and contributes to a sustainable development in many countries. Wind energy production is expected to increase in future and has experienced dramatic growth over the past decade in many countries worldwide. Offshore winds are generally stronger and more constant than onshore winds. Wind farms in real offshore sites, open seas with waves and water depth over 10 m, are now proposed in Persian Gulf, Caspian Sea and Gulf of Oman. This paper studies productivity and development of wind energy in Iran while setting out the developments that have taken place so far. There are many installed wind turbines in suitable regions like Manjil and Binalood in north, but there has not been any offshore wind installation yet in Iran. Also many suitable land sites have been identified for future installation of large wind turbines. Â© 2010 IEEE.

TI  - Model Reference Adaptive Controller Applied to a Wind Power Plant with HVDC Transmission
AB  - Commercial offshore Wind Power Plants (OWPP) started in 1991 and the number of installations increases each year, as well as their distances from the coast. For projects more than 70 km far from the coast, the trend is to use HVDC systems, since, in this way, problems with reactive power losses on the insulated cables are avoided. In these cases, on the offshore converter station, a PWM converter is used to produce three-phase voltages by forming a local grid, and also, to transmit in direct current the energy generated by the OWPP to a onshore converter station. In addition, the wind turbines are connected to this three-phase local grid. This work performs the model reference adaptive control of three-phase voltages of the grid forming converter. A three-phase generation converter, whose current control by MRAC is also demonstrated in this work, is connected to this local grid. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate the theoretical analysis.. Â© 2019 IEEE.

TI  - Underwater application of strain gauges
AB  - Offshore wind energy projects are based on engineering constructions with dimensions which have, as yet, not been handled and which, for system design and effective dimensioning, also require an effective experimental in situ analysis of the stress states of structures and foundations. For many decades already, stress analysis using strain gauges has been a proven and qualified method for analysing the loading conditions in structural mechanics. Against the background of the underwater use of these electrical sensor elements and the infrastructure for assembling and mounting of such offshore objects, the question of the protection of the strain gauge applications must be considered anew. In this article, an application solution developed by HBM and tested in the context of the research project FINO1 will be discussed. Special attention is thereby given to the possibility of realising this concept in accordance with the requirements of practical usage.

TI  - Mapping of the levelised cost of energy for floating offshore wind in the European Atlantic
AB  - Understanding the spatial variation of the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) of offshore wind is fundamental for identifying potential areas for the development of this technology. With this in view, this paper presents a largescale mapping of the LCOE of floating offshore wind over the European Atlantic, with a focus on floating semisubmersible platforms. The energy production is estimated accurately at every site using hindcast wind data combined with the power curve of an exemplar wind turbine. Furthermore, this work presents an analysis of the different costs incurred in the lifetime of the project using expressions depending on site-specific variables, i.e., water depth and distance to shore. The results highlight the paramount influence of the energy production and, therefore, the wind resource on the final cost of energy. The lowest LCOE values (-95 euro/MWh) correspond to the areas where the wind resource is most abundant: off Great Britain and Ireland, in the North Sea and off NW Spain. The influence of the resource leads inevitably to LCOE values somewhat higher off Portugal and Norway (-125 euro/MWh), and much higher in the Gulf of Biscay and south of the Iberian Peninsula (>160 euro/MWh). Within regions with a similar resource, e.g., the North Sea (LCOE in the range 95-135 euro/MWh), the distance to shore is found to be the main variable affecting the LCOE. By comparison, the costs related to water depth (primarily, mooring costs) are of little significance - unlike with bottom-fixed technologies.

TI  - Fleet monitoring and site specific environmental and operational conditions in wind energy
AB  - In wind energy, the objective of fleet monitoring is to achieve the best possible energy yield and to early detect upcoming defects or not optimally adjusted turbines. If a vibration-based SHM system like SHM.BladeÂ® is installed on all turbines of a wind park, an upgrade to fleet monitoring is possible. In the case of fleet monitoring, the vibration level of all turbines in a wind farm is related to their current yield. In general, the assumption is that all turbines in a park have more or less the same energy input and therefore can generate the same amount of electrical energy. Significant deviations from this, caused e.g. by false control, aerodynamically problems, mass imbalances, or damages, reduce the capacity of electricity production. A wind turbine is designed to convert the kinetic energy of wind into torque of the drive train. Therefore wind speed is the most decisive parameter for energy production of a turbine. The amount of energy that can be obtained from wind increases under ideal conditions with the third power of the wind speed. However the wind speed on site depends on different influences like e.g. turbulences in the lee of another turbine, wind park related difference in the height above sea level of individual turbine sites and the roughness of the ground. Therefore you cannot compare the energy yield of two turbines even if their locations are only some few 100 meters apart. The site specific difference in wind speed respectively the site specific efficiency is too big. Figure 3 shows the positions of three wind turbines in an existing wind park. The distance between the turbines is about 500 meters. However the efficiency factor related to the situation in the wind park differs considerably between 90, 8% and 95, 7% (see TABLE ). That means even very few meters difference with the height of the site and differences of roughness etc. can add together to an amount which is bigger than e.g. the influence of a misadjustment of the pitch angle. For that reason site specific Environmental and Operational Conditions (EOCs) have to be eliminated first before doing successful fleet monitoring. The paper will exemplify by means of real examples the importance of fleet monitoring and the necessity of EOC consideration within fleet monitoring of wind turbines.

TI  - Lifting Wind Turbine Components from a Floating Vessel: A Review on Current Solutions and Open Problems
AB  - Offshore wind energy is experiencing rapid development and is expected to make up an even bigger part of the world's future energy mix. New installation concepts for offshore wind farms involve lifting operations of wind turbine components from floating vessels. These installation concepts will only be economic if the lifting operations are performed safely at sea states with high significant wave heights. In this paper, we give an overview of current technical solutions, which could be used to lift the components tower, nacelle, hub, and rotor blade from a floating vessel. We classify and analyze solutions found in patents and the academic literature and point out open problems, which need to be addressed to enable lifting operations at higher sea states than what is currently feasible. However, we restrict the paper to technical solutions concerning the interface between the vessel and the component as well as the interface between the component and the crane. Consequently, we analyze, classify, and discuss solutions for the seafastening, the lifting gear as well as motion compensation systems. We find that there exists a large number of solutions, which are specific for a single component, but few solutions, which are applicable to all components without major adaptations. Additionally, we miss hydraulic seafastening mechanisms, which are remotely controlled and synchronized with the lifting operation. Consequently, we argue that versatile interfaces between the component and the crane as well as remotely controlled and synchronized seafastening mechanisms are best suited to enhance the lifting process.

TI  - Offshore wind energy development in the exclusive economic zone: Legal and policy supports and impediments in Germany and the US
AB  - The development of renewable energy as a major component of efforts to combat climate change serves as the impetus for the location of energy production facilities in coastal ocean space. Yet, while many coastal nations see offshore renewable energy development as an important way forward, the speed and manner in which these efforts take shape vary dramatically. This paper assesses the role of coastal nations' domestic legal and policy frameworks in the siting of offshore renewable energy facilities in areas under federal jurisdiction. It focuses on two nations-Germany and the United States. Both have articulated their interest in renewable offshore energy, but while Germany has approved many offshore sites, recent US proposals have for the most part stalled. Based on a review of legal and policy documents, laws and regulations, academic literature, and interviews, this research identifies and compares factors that figure most prominently for the development of offshore renewable energy policies. Comparisons are organized under four categories: the regulatory framework, the public's role in siting, targeted economic mechanisms, and indirect mechanisms. The paper concludes with observations about prominent supports and impediments and suggestions for further research. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Coupling floating wind turbines with large- scale air-conditioning systems through deep sea water pumping: Case studies of system performance in European Deep Waters
AB  - This chapter presents a novel concept for utilising offshore-floating wind turbines to concurrently exploit cold deep sea water (DSW) for large-scale cooling applications, as well as electricity production. This concept utilises wind turbinedriven pumps that extract cold DSW and pump it across a high-pressure pipeline to a land-based hydroelectric power station coupled to a centralised air-conditioning (AC) unit of a district cooling system. The wind-driven intermittent supply of cold water exiting the hydroelectric station is diverted to the condenser of the unit and mixed with sea surface water (SSW) to maintain a steady flow. The use of DSW lowers the condensation temperature of the refrigerant in the AC unit, resulting in an improved coefficient of performance for cooling conditions. This chapter investigates the potential application of the concept described above to four European deep offshore sites located in the Mediterranean Sea: the Greek Islands, Malta, the South of France and Spain. The numerical model used to compute the energy yield characteristics at these sites assumes a single offshore wind turbine system with modules for the wind turbine-pump assembly, the deep sea thermocline formations and the frictional/thermal losses across the pipeline and the hydroelectric turbine. Another module is dedicated to the thermodynamic refrigeration cycle for the AC unit. The study confirmed that although the losses incurred in transmitting energy from offshore wind turbines through the DSW pipeline are larger than those for conventional wind turbines relying on electrical cables, such losses may be partially or fully compensated for by the superior performance of the wind turbine-driven hydraulic pumps at high wind speeds and by the energy savings incurred in AC plants through DSW utilisation. The latter savings were found to be the highest for the Greek Islands due to favourable wind conditions also prevailing during the hot summer months.

TI  - A wind tunnel study of neutral flow above complex terrain features
AB  - The turbulent flow above a complex terrain model has been studied in a wind tunnel. The model is generic and based on locations in coastal areas of current interest for wind farms. Several terrain features are represented in the model. It is split up into modules which can be studied both separately and together to cause an even more complex flow. The flow is approximately 2D in some cases, and highly 3D in others. The inflow boundary layer is typical for wind profiles above open sea. A large number of profiles were measured. These were taken in regions where the flow was characterised by velocity speed-up, separation and flow recovery. Laser Doppler Anemometry was used for the measurements, and quantities like mean values and turbulent stresses were calculated. Flow conditions that are very favourable from a wind power point of view were found. Rounded hills with various slopes resulted in speed-up and quite homogenous velocities with height above ground, while the stresses were only significantly altered in a thin layer close to the ground. In the case of a sharp ridge instead of a rounded hill, increased turbulence levels and less favourable mean velocity profiles were observed. When the flow passed a higher mountain before it entered a rounded hill, the turbulence level increased up to very high altitudes and the mean velocity was reduced.

TI  - Cost benefit analysis of mothership concept and investigation of optimum chartering strategy for offshore wind farms
AB  - The focus of this research is the cost benefit analysis of the mothership concept and the investigation of the optimum chartering strategy, which brings financial and operational benefits. This is achieved by performing operational simulations in the offshore wind operational expenditure and logistics planning tool StrathOW-OM, which is developed by the University of Strathclyde and commercial partner organisations. In this paper, a fixed accommodation platform concept, two mothership concepts and different vessel chartering periods are simulated. The simulation results are compared with a base case scenario, in which the O\&M activities are performed through a conventional onshore base. The simulation results show that significant travel time is spent in far offshore, if only a single conventional onshore base is utilised in the operations. Among different vessel chartering periods (continuous, only summer months, only winter months or combination of summer months and winter months), October-December is identified as the most critical period for chartering a mothership.

TI  - Investigation of V-shaped blade for the performance improvement of vertical axis wind turbines
AB  - The vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) is regarded as an important device to utilize the renewable offshore wind energy to supplement the existing power systems. Hence, the demand for higher wind energy conversion makes the research focus on the blade optimization of wind turbines. This paper attempts to propose a novel VAWT structure with V-shaped blade to improve the power outputs at moderate tip speed ratios. The feasibility of the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes SST kappa - omega turbulence model applied on the VAWT was verified against available experiments at first. Then a comprehensive investigation on the aerodynamic performance of such V-shaped VAWT was carried out using the SST kappa - omega model. The results indicated that the maximum enhancement in power coefficient obtained in the optimal V-shaped blade was about 24.1\%. In addition to the great improvement of the power efficiency, the V-shaped blade was proven to alleviate the damage caused by lateral loads to the wind turbine. Besides, the flow structures over the blade surface were studied to reveal the mechanism of dynamic stall with the reason of power increase explained. Moreover, it was found that the V-shaped blade could effectively suppress the flow separation and delay the dynamic stall in the middle of the blade, and the undesirable blade tip effect would not be more serious comparing to that of the conventional straight blade. It was finally concluded that the current work could be practically applied to the design and optimization of the VAWT blades.

TI  - Analysis of offshore wind turbine operation & maintenance using a novel time domain meteo-ocean modeling approach
AB  - This paper presents a novel approach to repair modeling using a time domain Auto-Regressive model to represent meteo-ocean site conditions. The short term hourly correlations, medium term access windows of periods up to days and the annual distribution of site data are captured. In addition, seasonality is included. Correlation observed between wind and wave site can be incorporated if simultaneous data exists. Using this approach a time series for both significant wave height and mean wind speed is described. This allows MTTR to be implemented within the reliability simulation as a variable process, dependent on significant wave height. This approach automatically captures site characteristics including seasonality and allows for complex analysis using time dependent constraints such as working patterns to be implemented. A simple cost model for lost revenue determined by the concurrent simulated wind speed is also presented. A preliminary investigation of the influence of component reliability and access thresholds at various existing sites on availability is presented demonstrating the ability of the modeling approach to offer new insights into offshore wind turbine operation and maintenance.

TI  - Using thermal energy storage to relieve wind generation curtailment in an island microgrid
AB  - The uncertainty and intermittency of the available wind resource in nature would potentially cause wind generation curtailment when the flexibility of the integrated power grid is limited, especially in small-scale microgrids for islands. In this paper, an optimal configuration method is proposed to use thermal energy storage (TES) to relieve wind generation curtailment in an island microgrid. The thermal network is modeled along with the electrical network to utilize its regulation capability, while TES is introduced as an additional flexibility resource. The detailed cost models of combined heat and power (CHP) units and TES are presented to realize the objective of minimizing the overall operating cost. The performance of TES in improving wind power utilization is firstly validated by using an electrical boiler (EB) as a benchmark and further analyzed under different scenarios considering the growths of wind power capacity, electrical load, and heat load. The ef-fectiveness of the proposed method is validated using real-world data obtained from the practical island microgrid. Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Control Interaction Modeling and Analysis of Grid-Forming Battery Energy Storage System for Offshore Wind Power Plant
AB  - With the increasing deployment of offshore wind power plants (WPPs), the grid-forming (GFM) battery energy storage system (BESS) has recently emerged as an attractive solution to improve the dynamic performances of WPPs. However, the control interactions of the GFM-BESS and offshore WPP, under different grid strengths, tend to complicate the controller-parameter tuning. This paper presents a modeling method for analyzing control interactions of offshore WPP and GFM-BESS, which sheds clear insights into the critical controller parameters to the system dynamics. Differing from conventional methods, a frequency-domain model of GFM-BESS, obtained by taking the Laplace transform of the corresponding state-space model, is developed first. This allows the impedance model of offshore WPP, including a black-box model of long transmission cable, to be flexibly integrated. Based on the model, both closed-loop transfer-function and pole-based dynamic analyses are then performed. Electromagnetic transient simulations corroborate the effectiveness of the model and analysis.

TI  - Effect of fender system on the dynamic response of onsite installation of floating offshore wind turbines
AB  - This paper discusses a new installation method for floating offshore wind with installation procedure, essential variables, and fender system effects on the dynamic responses. The conventional installation method involves mating wind turbines and substructures in calm and protected waters and towing the assembled units to an operating site. Due to geographical, time, and economic disadvantages, this method may be challenging to meet the rapidly surging demand for floating wind power worldwide. The new onsite installation method was introduced as an alternative, using a catamaran to install fully assembled wind turbines at the operation site. The proposed concept can be employed to install and maintain fixed and floating offshore wind turbines in any location. While the conventional installation method consists of a series of installation processes, the proposed installation steps can be performed in parallel, suggesting more flexible operation planning. Fenders and wires were applied as a mechanical coupling system to enable onsite installation in harsh offshore environments. The fender system with pretensions on wires showed reduction effects on the relative horizontal displacement, relative vertical displacement, and relative alignment by approximately 78\%, 64\%, and 32\%, respectively. Therefore, the fender system application can significantly increase the practicality of the onsite installation method.

TI  - Application of a Monte Carlo procedure for probabilistic fatigue design of floating offshore wind turbines
AB  - Fatigue load assessment of floating offshore wind turbines poses new challenges on the feasibility of numerical procedures. Due to the increased sensitivity of the considered system with respect to the environmental conditions from wind and ocean, the application of common procedures used for fixed-bottom structures results in either inaccurate simulation results or hard-to-quantify conservatism in the system design. Monte Carlo-based sampling procedures provide a more realistic approach to deal with the large variation in the environmental conditions, although basic randomization has shown slow convergence. Specialized sampling methods allow efficient coverage of the complete design space, resulting in faster convergence and hence a reduced number of required simulations. In this study, a quasi-random sampling approach based on Sobol sequences is applied to select representative events for the determination of the lifetime damage. This is calculated applying Monte Carlo integration, using subsets of a resulting total of 16 200 coupled time-domain simulations performed with the simulation code FAST. The considered system is the Danmarks Tekniske Universitet (DTU) 10 MW reference turbine installed on the LIFES50 + OO-Star Wind Floater Semi 10 MW floating platform. Statistical properties of the considered environmental parameters (i.e., wind speed, wave height and wave period) are determined based on the measurement data from the Gulf of Maine, USA. Convergence analyses show that it is sufficient to perform around 200 simulations in order to reach less than 10\% uncertainty of lifetime fatigue damage-equivalent loading. Complementary in-depth investigation is performed, focusing on the load sensitivity and the impact of outliers (i.e., values far away from the mean). Recommendations for the implementation of the proposed methodology in the design process are also provided.

TI  - Site-specific wave energy conversion performance of an oscillating water column device
AB  - The energy conversion performance of oscillating water column (OWC)wave energy converters at a specific site is often studied by means of analytical models. Based on linear theory, these models lose accuracy when viscous losses and turbulence become significantâ€”more generally, when nonlinear effects play a role, as they often do in real operating conditions. In this work we apply a novel methodology based on a combination of numerical modelling and laboratory tests to investigate OWC performance without these shortcomings. First, high-resolution wave resource characterisation matrices are obtained by means of numerical modelling. Second, the resource matrices are combined with the OWC efficiency matrices obtained through laboratory tests and, importantly, including the effects of turbine-induced damping and air compressibilityâ€”usually disregarded in small-scale laboratory tests, but relevant for full-size (prototype)devices. The combined matrices thus obtained express, through a wave height-period distribution, the energy captured by the OWC for different values of the damping coefficient. On this basis, developers can select the most appropriate value of turbine-induced damping for a given site, based on performance values. The implementation of the novel methodology is illustrated through a case study in Galicia (NW Spain), in which three deployment sites are considered. We find that the turbine-induced damping must be matched to the wave climate of the site for an OWC device to achieve high performance; indeed, changes in damping cause variations in the total annual energy captured of up to 11%, which increase to 25% for specific sea states.

TI  - Wave energy resource assessment: A comparative study for two coastal areas in japan
AB  - A comparative study of wave energy resources is conducted for two coastal areas in Japan (located on east and south coast) based on wave hindcasts. Wave energy resource assessment was performed using monthly and seasonal climatology, and annual means. Results from a comparative analysis indicate that the nearshore area on the east coast of Japan has a higher potential for wave power generation. The most energetic months are September and October and levels of wave energy are within 7.0 to 12.0 kWmâˆ’1, whereas summer months (June, July, and August) provide less energy (4.0 to 6.0 kWmâˆ’1). From seasonal variation, higher wave energy is observed throughout DJF, MAM, and SON (6.0 to 10.0 kWmâˆ’1). The level of wave energy drops to 5.0 kWmâˆ’1 during JJA. This study indicates that the nearshore locations are suitable for wave power generation since they have moderate potential and less variability in wave energy content.

TI  - Exploration on topologies of modular multilevel multi-port DC-DC substations applied in offshore dc wind farm
AB  - With large-scale development of offshore wind farms, to design a cost-effective collection and transmission grid for distributed wind power has become a vital problem. Compared with conventional AC collection and DC transmission in offshore wind farm, DC wind farm, with its smaller size, larger capacity, higher efficiency and many other advantages, are getting more and more attention. As a key equipment in the DC wind farm, the multi-port DC-DC substation collects and transmit the wind power. Based on MMC structure, this article presents several possible topologies of the multi-port DC-DC substation applied in the DC wind farm. Moreover, these topologies are analyzed and compared related to ratio, capacity, fault isolation and other aspects. Recommendations about the choice of substation topology under different occasions are given as well as applied in offshore DC wind farm. Â© 2016 Chin. Soc. for Elec. Eng.

TI  - The state-of-the-art review on energy harvesting from flow-induced vibrations
AB  - In this paper, the currently popular flow-induced vibrations energy harvesting technologies are reviewed, including numerical and experimental endeavors, and some existing or proposed energy capture concepts and devices are discussed. The energy harvesting mechanism and current research progress of four types of flowinduced vibrations, such as vortex-induced vibrations, galloping, flutter and buffeting, are introduced. To enhance the performance of the harvesters and broaden the operating range, the researchers have proposed various mechanical designs, methods of the structures' surfaces optimization and concepts with incorporated magnets for multistability.

TI  - Open-Source Code-Based Tidal Modeling of Tropical and Temperate Waters
AB  - Tidal energy is the most reliable and predictable form of renewable energy capable of ensuring energy security in coastal regions of the world. Many developing countries are prone to energy self-sufficiency due to a lack of tidal data, expensive commercial tidal modeling tools, and program codes. In the present study, an open-source finite element code along with available open-source data was used to predict the tidal resource potential of sites in both temperate and coastal waters. This paper also investigates the suitability of open-source code towards accurate tidal resource prediction and provides a comparative study on tidal resource prediction of sites in both temperate and coastal waters. Based on knowledge gained from tidal experts all around the globe, the straits of the Alderney race were selected as a temperate water site because of their high tidal flow conditions and high tidal energy resource potential. Singapore was selected as a tropical water site because of its low tidal flow conditions and lack of open-source tidal resource data in the tropical belt. From the results, temperate waters such as Alderney Race experience high tidal velocity in the range of 3.5â€“4.5Â m/s with an average power density of about 15Â kW/m2 in comparison with tropical waters such as Singapore that experiences tidal velocity in the range of 1â€“1.5Â m/s with an average power density of about 1.5Â kW/m2. The thrusting force behind the coastal dynamics is mainly due to tides, their interactions, and changes in seabed topography. The seabed roughness profile creates a drag force on the flow on the velocity field. Lack of understanding of the effects of seabed friction on tidal modeling might reduce the accuracy of the model prediction. Thus, the present study also focuses on the effects of seabed roughness on tidal prediction of Alderney race straits using the open-source finite element-based 2-dimensional depth average ocean model. It can be found that an increase in seabed friction reduces the flow velocity and thus the average power density of the location due to its major energy dissipating phenomenon for the energetic ocean flow.

TI  - Offshore cost of energy for DFIG Prc turbines vs. PMG FRC turbines
AB  - In order to bring the Cost of Energy (CoE) from offshore wind in line with traditional energy generation forms, turbine types that produce the lowest CoE must be chosen. Modern wind turbines vary greatly in their drive train configurations. With the variety of options available it can be difficult to determine which type is most suitable for offshore applications. A large percentage of modern drive trains consist of either doubly fed induction generators with partially rated converters or permanent magnet generators with fully rated converters. These configurations were the focus of this empirical CoE comparison. The turbine populations from which CoE inputs were drawn for this comparison contained âˆ¼2,600 turbines. The findings from this comparison show that, for a hypothetical 100 turbine site 40km offshore, the PMG FRC turbine has a CoE that is Â£2.31/MWh lower than that of a DFIG PRC turbine.

TI  - Static and dynamic analysis of monopile foundation for offshore wind farm
AB  - Offshore wind energy offers a huge potential for expansion of renewable energy in the world. However, placement of wind turbines in harsh offshore environments is an engineering challenge, which requires development of suitable foundation to support turbines. Among 4 typical types of offshore foundations, monopile foundation is selected and designed for 2.3 MW offshore wind turbine (OWT) in Weihai, China, considering water depth, soil conditions, foundation cost and other factors. In a three dimensional (3D) finite element model of monopile, the layered seabed soil where the pile is embedded is considered in a soil-structure interaction formulation. Maximum stress and deformation of the monopile are computed under 4 load cases in different operating phases. The natural frequencies of the monopile foundation are given through the modal analysis. Results show that the designed monopile can effectively preclude resonance with the wind turbine. Moreover, the dynamic response of monopile foundation under wave and seismic loads are carried out by transient analysis method, the time histories of the deformation and stress are presented, and dynamic amplification factors (DAF) of maximum stress and deformation are discussed. It is suggested that the dynamic effect must be attached importance in the design. Copyright Â© 2010 by The International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).

TI  - Decadal variability of extreme wave height representing storm severity in the northeast Atlantic and North Sea since the foundation of the Royal Society
AB  - Long-term estimation of extreme wave height remains a key challenge because of the short duration of available wave data, and also because of the possible impact of climate variability on ocean waves. Here, we analyse storm-based statistics to obtain estimates of extreme wave height at locations in the northeast Atlantic and North Sea using the NORA10 wave hindcast (1958-2011), and use a 5 year sliding window to examine temporal variability. The decadal variability is correlated to the North Atlantic oscillation and other atmospheric modes, using a six-term predictor model incorporating the climate indices and their Hilbert transforms. This allows reconstruction of the historic extreme climate back to 1661, using a combination of known and proxy climate indices. Significant decadal variability primarily driven by the North Atlantic oscillation is observed, and this should be considered for the long-term survivability of offshore structures and marine renewable energy devices. The analysis on wave climate reconstruction reveals that the variation of the mean, 99th percentile and extreme wave climates over decadal time scales for locations close to the dominant storm tracks in the open North Atlantic are comparable, whereas the wave climates for the rest of the locations including the North Sea are rather different.

TI  - Design strategies and life cycle assessment for the improvement of economic and environmental sustainability of obrec
AB  - The environmental consequences due to the construction and installation of energy conversion systems that exploit the marine waves have not been taken into high consideration so far. The reasons are related to the fact that these devices are still under development and not many systems have been built. However, with the growth in the number of projects and tests at sea, potential environmental impacts should be considered as well. This work has the purpose of framing the Overtopping BReakwater for Energy Conversion (OBREC) system, implemented and tested in the port of Naples (Italy), with a view to identifying design, construction and maintenance strategies to improve its sustainability performances. Among the priority aspects there is certainly the intention to provide forecasts and promote initiatives and processes, in terms of eco-design, aimed at ensuring that the design and construction activities target the entire life cycle of the device, reducing or eliminating resources, materials and production processes with potential negative effects in economic and environmental terms. In this regard, to select affordable and environmentally friendly construction products for the OBREC prototype, an application was created using the BEES (Building for Environmental and Economic Sustainability) software. Developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Engineering Laboratory, the instrument measures the environmental performance of construction products using the LCA approach specified in the ISO 14040 series of standards. Five different types of concrete were considered (including a classic Portland cement, a classic Portland limestone cement and three concretes with recycled aggregate in percentages of 20, 35 and 50% respectively). The results show that Portland ordinary cement is the best environmentally friendly solution if the supply source is the same distance away. In fact, for cements with coarse aggregates partly deriving from recycling, gradually increasing acidification phenomena occur, thus making their selections uncertain and risky.

TI  - Optimal controller design and constraints analysis of a sea wave energy converter
AB  - This paper studies the optimal control of a sea wave energy converter (WEC). A linear optimal controller is designed for the WEC to maximise the energy output. Rather than regulating states and control inputs as a conventional optimal controller normally does, the proposed optimal controller aims to maximise the energy output. The maximum output admissible set method is employed to estimate the feasibility of the proposed linear optimal controller when the input and state constraints need to be considered for safe operation of the WEC.

TI  - Simple bottom-up hierarchical control strategy for heaving wave energy converters
AB  - The objective of this study was to improve the power captured in heaving wave energy converters using a simple robust hierarchical control strategy (HCS). A HCS comprises a higher level controller (HLC) and a lower level controller (LLC). The HLC provides a reference velocity for the buoy, which is in-phase with the wave's excitation force. The LLC follows the reference despite the uncertainties in the model. We propose a new HCS called bottom-up HCS (BU-HCS), where the LLC is designed before the HLC. The LLC is implemented using a feedback controlled system with a simple lead-lag compensator as its controller. The lead-lag compensator is designed using Hâˆž theory with the objectives of maximizing the robustness and tracking properties of the LLC while minimizing the control force of the power take-off (PTO) device. A set of optimization problem is obtained for designing the parameters of the lead-lag compensator, which are solved using a genetic algorithm. The HLC in the BU-HCS provides the velocity reference, which satisfies a constraint on the control force and the PTO's utilization index. The HLC is implemented by designing the value of an intrinsic resistance constant, which can be found using the Bode magnitude plot of a transfer function. Based on the plot, a look-up table for the intrinsic resistance constant is generated as a function of the significant height and the peak period of the wave. We tested the proposed method in various scenarios and its performance was compared with existing control techniques. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Development of Combined Load Spectra for Offshore Structures Subjected to Wind, Wave, and Ice Loading
AB  - Fixed offshore wind turbines continue to be developed for high latitude areas where not only wind and wave loads need to be considered but also moving sea ice. Current rules and regulations for the design of fixed offshore structures in ice-covered waters do not adequately consider the effects of ice loading and its stochastic nature on the fatigue life of the structure. Ice crushing on such structures results in ice-induced vibrations, which can be represented by loading the structure using a variable-amplitude loading (VAL) sequence. Typical offshore load spectra are developed for wave and wind loading. Thus, a combined VAL spectrum is developed for wind, wave, and ice action. To this goal, numerical models are used to simulate the dynamic ice-, wind-, and wave-structure interaction. The stress time-history at an exemplarily selected critical point in an offshore wind energy monopile support structure is extracted from the model and translated into a VAL sequence, which can then be used as a loading sequence for the fatigue assessment or fatigue testing of welded joints of offshore wind turbine support structures. This study presents the approach to determine combined load spectra and standardized time series for wind, wave, and ice action. Â© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Power Generation Prediction Method of Offshore Wind Turbines Based on Cascaded Deep Learning
AB  - Aiming at the problems of low prediction accuracy, long time, and poor results in current wind turbine generation power prediction methods, an offshore wind turbine generation power prediction method based on cascaded deep learning is proposed. Using deep belief networks, stacked autoencoding networks, and long short-term memory networks, a cascaded deep learning method is proposed to predict the power generation of offshore wind turbines. Multiple feature extractors are used to extract and fuse high-level features to form a unified feature with richer information to predict the power generation sequence of offshore wind turbines. According to the modeling strategy and port design strategy, using the stacked autoencoding networks as the basic unit, a cascaded deep learning model for generating power prediction of offshore wind turbines is established. Through the selection of input variables, the variables that have a great correlation with wind power are obtained. The layer-by-layer greedy algorithm is used for training from bottom to top, and supervised learning is used to fine-tune the network parameters from top to bottom to realize the generation power prediction of the offshore wind turbine. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in predicting the power generation of offshore wind turbines, which can effectively improve the prediction accuracy and shorten the prediction time.

TI  - The 2021 gravimetric and hybrid geoid models for Taiwan and offshore islands: Application to a seamless vertical datum
AB  - We construct the 2021 gravimetric and hybrid geoid models that cover the island of Taiwan and the offshore islands of Kinmen, Matzu, Penghu, Liuqiu, Lyudao, and Lanyu, where new gravity data and observed geoidal heights are available. The mean sea levels around Matzu, Penghu, and Lanyu are re-defined by better tidal records, resulting in new gravity anomalies. The gravity measurements from airborne, shipborne, and terrestrial gravimeters and from altimeters are combined to form a 30 `' x 30 `' grid of free-air gravity anomalies. The terrain corrections are computed using updated land DEMs and ocean depths and then used to generate Faye gravity anomalies. A gravimetric geoid is created by the remove-compute-restore technique using the 1-D FFT implementation of Stokes' integration with a modified kernel. A hybrid geoid is then created using the gravimetric geoid and the observed geoidal heights. The means and the standard deviations of the differences between the model geoidal heights from the gravimetric geoid and from the observations are up to few dm and to less than 10 cm, and are reduced to few cm and 0 - 6 cm respectively when the model values are from the hybrid geoid. The hybrid geoid in the Taiwan Strait is assessed against the sea surface heights from the DTU18 mean sea surface model and the TOPEX-Jason series of altimeters. The hybrid geoid is one essential surface in a seamless vertical datum around Taiwan that define land elevations and ocean depths in a unified way. We discuss the potential application of the hybrid geoid to orthometric heighting in the TWVD2001 system in offshore wind farms in the Taiwan Strait.

TI  - NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS for IMPACTS of OFFSHORE WIND POWER FACILITIES on CURRENTS and WATER QUALITY
AB  - When selecting a suitable site for offshore wind farm, the impact on the marine environment is one of the most important issues. However, in most cases of the suitable sites selection, the distances from protected areas, spawning and wintering grounds of marine creatures are taken into account as environmental indicators, and there are few which explicitly consider the impact of the offshore wind farm on marine ecosystem including current field and water quality which could be affected by the construction of offshore power plants. In this study, the impacts of offshore wind farms on the flow field and water quality were investigated by numerical simulations, introducing models of offshore wind farms facilities and sessile organism on the structure into a three-dimensional coupled hydrodynamicecosystem models. A nesting grid system were employed which combines a farm-scale grid and a local-scale grid. The largescale simulation results showed that the changes in current due to a foundation structure of wind turbine could affect the flow field around the downstream structures. It is also found that water quality change in this scale is mainly caused by the changes in current field and the effects of sessile organisms on the structures are small. On the other hand, the small-scale results shows that the effects of sessile organisms may also appear in the very near vicinity of the structure. By using the developed model, it is possible to visualize the extent of the changes in currents and water quality caused by the offshore wind farm facilities. Â© 2022 by ASME.

TI  - Wave energy assessments in the Black Sea
AB  - The present work aims to evaluate the wave energy resources in the Black Sea basin. The study is focused on the western part of the sea, which is traditionally considered as being more energetic. In order to give a first perspective of the wave climate, a medium-term wave analysis was carried out using in situ measured data. As a further step, a wave prediction system was implemented for the Black Sea. This was based on the simulating waves near-shore model, which is used for both wave generation and near-shore transformation. This methodology has the advantage that a single model covers the full scale of the modelling process. Various tests were performed considering data measured at three different locations. Special attention was paid to the whitecapping process, which is still widely considered to be the weak link in deep water wave modelling. Comparisons carried out against measured data show that the wave prediction system generally provides reliable results, especially in terms of significant wave heights and mean periods. By increasing the resolution in geographical space, the field distributions of wave energy were analysed for both high and average wave conditions. The analysis and the wave prediction system developed are a prerequisite for further investigations extended in time and with increased resolution in the near-shore direction. Â© 2009 JASNAOE.

TI  - Development of a low speed linear generator for use in a wave energy converter
AB  - One of the main advantages of ocean waves as resource for electrical energy production is its high energy density. Several methods have been proposed for the conversion of ocean wave mechanical energy into electrical energy. One such method consists in the use of a direct drive linear generator enclosed inside a floating element. The generator is driven by a mass-spring system, which oscillates due to the ocean waveâ€™s movement. In this paper are presented the study, development, and dynamic simulation of a linear tubular synchronous low speed permanent magnet generator, for use in a wave energy conversion system. The generator was dimensioned using a finite element analysis tool. The wave energy converter dynamic model, mechanical and electrical, was developed to evaluate its response. To validate the generatorâ€™s dimensioning and dynamic model, its prototype was built. The dynamic model simulation results and the prototypeâ€™s experimental results are presented.

The essential problem is finding a method to convert dispersed, alternating forces into concentrated, direct forces. This paper deals with a new type of wave-energy converting device that uses the phenomenon of synchronization of the unbalanced rotor. It is known that an unbalanced rotor may be kept in rotation by an oscillatory motion applied to its point of support. This device consists of a rotor with a large unbalanced weight, installed on a ship that is resonantly excited by the ocean wave, and a power generator connected to the rotor by an overdrive gear.

TI  - The impacts of wave energy conversion on coastal morphodynamics
AB  - In recent decades, utilization of renewable energy resources, including ocean waves, has been promoted as part of a global effort to transition away from the use of fossil fuels. This is largely due to the accompanying greenhouse gas emissions and its catastrophic impacts on the environment, which are expected to worsen with the changing climate. Energy from ocean waves can be harnessed and converted into electricity with devices referred to as wave energy converters (WECs). Many researchers have studied the impacts of the WECs on coastal hydrodynamics, however, the impact on morphodynamics is not as well understood. In this paper, we review studies that assess the impacts of wave farms on coastal erosion.

TI  - An Unsteady Pressure Probe for the Measurement of Flow Unsteadiness in Tidal Channels
AB  - An unsteady five-hole probe has been developed for the measurement of turbulent flow in tidal channels. Such measurements are vital for accurate prediction of unsteady loads on tidal turbines. Existing field-based velocimeters are either unable to capture the required range of frequencies or are too expensive to profile the variation of turbulence across a typical tidal power site, and thus the available data is inadequate for turbine design. This work adapts the traditional five-hole wind tunnel probe to achieve a low-cost device with sufficient frequency range for tidal turbine applications. The main issue in the marine environment is that the ambient hydrostatic pressure is much higher than the dynamic pressure. This has been overcome by using novel calibration coefficients and differential transducers. In flume tank tests against laser Doppler velocimeter measurements, the frequency response of the probe has been shown to be sufficient to capture all the frequencies necessary for tidal turbine design.

TI  - Exposure of Whimbrels to offshore wind leases during departure from and arrival to a major mid-Atlantic staging site
AB  - The United States is pursuing a diversified energy portfolio that includes offshore wind with a focus on the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The Western Atlantic Flyway (WAF) supports one of the largest near-shore movement corridors of birds in the world, including several shorebird species of high conservation concern. We used satellite transmitters to examine orientation of Whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus) crossing the OCS and their overlap with two wind energy leases. Birds using a migratory staging site along the Delmarva Peninsula in Virginia crossed the OCS along a southeast-northwest axis. A considerable percentage (42.9\%) of tracks intersected with one of the two wind leases. The juxtaposition to the Delmarva Peninsula placed wind leases southeast of the peninsula within both the departure and arrival trajectories of Whimbrels. The satellite transmitters used in this study were not equipped with altitude sensors, so we do not know if birds crossed wind leases within the rotor swept zone. Several species of shorebirds, including hundreds of thousands of individuals, make trans-Atlantic flights from three major staging sites: Delaware Bay, the lower Delmarva Peninsula, and Georgia Bight. All of these sites have wind leases positioned to their southeast. One of the most effective strategies for minimizing conflicts between birds and potential hazards is to place hazards away from critical movement corridors. More information is needed about departure and arrival patterns of shorebirds that cross the OCS to inform future lease placement.

TI  - Influence of turbulent wind on dynamic response of articulated wind turbine [æ¹æµé£Žå¯¹é“°æŽ¥å¼æµ·ä¸Šé£ŽåŠ›æœºåŠ¨åŠ›å“åº”çš„å½±å“]
AB  - To meet the needs of offshore wind power development in medium depth water and reduce the cost, an articulated wind turbine was designed based on articulated platform. The influence of turbulent wind on the dynamic response of the articulated wind turbine in working and extreme sea conditions was studied. The blade element momentum theory was utilized to calculate the aerodynamic load and the potential theory was applied for the simulation of wave load. Considering the coupled loads of wind, wave, and current, the instantaneous change in wet surface as well as the friction damping of the articulated joint, a calculation software was written and time domain dynamic response of the wind turbine was calculated. Based on the NPD spectrum of turbulent wind, the dynamic response of the articulated wind turbine under the loads of constant wind and turbulent wind were calculated, and the influence of turbulent wind on the dynamic response and energy efficiency of the wind turbine was analyzed. Results show that with turbulent wind, the wind wheel acceleration and the vertical pull force on the articulated joint had little change. The mean values of oscillation angle, stream-wise thrust, output power, and stream-wise thrust force on the articulated joint decreased, but the amplitudes of oscillation angle and output power increased. In addition, the low-frequency characteristics of turbulent wind could increase the low-frequency response of the system and thereby cause system resonation. In extreme climate condition, the maximum stream-wise oscillation angle of the articulated foundation increased significantly, but the turbine system still met survival requirements. Hence, turbulent wind has great influence on the dynamic response of articulated wind turbine, and it is necessarily to consider the impact of turbulent wind when analyzing the movement and strength of articulated wind turbines.

TI  - A new bi-level optimisation framework for optimising a multi-modewave energy converter design: A case study for the marettimo island, mediterranean sea
AB  - To advance commercialisation of ocean wave energy and for the technology to become competitive with other sources of renewable energy, the cost of wave energy harvesting should be significantly reduced. The Mediterranean Sea is a region with a relatively low wave energy potential, but due to the absence of extreme waves, can be considered at the initial stage of the prototype development as a proof of concept. In this study, we focus on the optimisation of a multi-mode wave energy converter inspired by the CETO system to be tested in the west of Sicily, Italy. We develop a computationally efficient spectral-domain model that fully captures the nonlinear dynamics of a wave energy converter (WEC). We consider two different objective functions for the purpose of optimising a WEC: (1) maximise the annual average power output (with no concern for WEC cost), and (2) minimise the levelised cost of energy (LCoE). We develop a new bi-level optimisation framework to simultaneously optimise the WEC geometry, tether angles and power take-off (PTO) parameters. In the upper-level of this bi-level process, all WEC parameters are optimised using a state-of-the-art self-adaptive differential evolution method as a global optimisation technique. At the lower-level, we apply a local downhill search method to optimise the geometry and tether angles settings in two independent steps. We evaluate and compare the performance of the new bi-level optimisation framework with seven well-known evolutionary and swarm optimisation methods using the same computational budget. The simulation results demonstrate that the bi-level method converges faster than other methods to a better configuration in terms of both absorbed power and the levelised cost of energy. The optimisation results confirm that if we focus on minimising the produced energy cost at the given location, the best-found WEC dimension is that of a small WEC with a radius of 5 m and height of 2 m.

TI  - Critical evaluation of ecosystem changes from an offshore wind farm: producing natural capital asset and risk registers
AB  - Offshore wind infrastructure modifies benthic habitats, affecting ecosystem services. A natural capital approach allows risks to nature-based assets and ecosystem benefits to be assessed. The UK Natural Capital Committee produced guidance for conducting natural capital assessments to aid decision making processes. Development of an asset register and risk register are key components of this methodology. The former provides an inventory of NC stocks, and the latter considers the likelihood of changes and the scale of their impact on delivery of ecosystem services. In this study, suitability of the methodology in a marine environment context was critically evaluated. Natural capital stocks before and after installation of Greater Gabbard offshore wind farm were compared and risks to delivery of ecosystem services were assessed. It was demonstrated that incorporating an assessment of impacts on natural capital assets in planning and management decisions (as an extension to traditional environmental impact assessment approaches) could further facilitate sustainable use of marine ecosystems. For example, by preventing access to bottom-trawl fisheries activities, wind farms may promote recovery and increase value of seabed natural capital assets. By also introducing aquaculture systems loss of food provision (from reduced fishing activity) could be offset whilst allowing benthic natural capital assets to recover. Natural capital assessment is relevant to the marine context. However, application of the Natural Capital Committee's methodology was constrained by the limited coverage of standard benthic sampling tools. Given the scale of wind energy plans across the marine environment it is recommended that these shortcomings are appropriately addressed. Â© 2022

TI  - Characterization of a High Frequency Transformer with HTS Winding and Amorphous Magnetic Core for Power Converter Application
AB  - Power converter with high frequency transformers (HFTs) are being widely used in the field of electric vehicle, switching mode power supply, renewable energy sectors including oceanic wave energy converter and so on. This paper proposes an improved compact design of a 4.75 kW, 100 kHz superconducting HFT that would offer size minimization facilities of power converters. Yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO) material-based superconductor is used for maximum power transfer analysis. The proposed superconducting winding is compact which would minimize the thermal limitation and proximity effect. The proposed HFT is characterized for using the conventional and advanced magnetic materials with gapped and ungapped structures. Gapped toroidal core structure of HFT offers improved capability of withstanding de bias magnetizing current which occurs in many cases including isolation. Simulation results show the comparison of magnetic flux density, core loss, and power including air gap effect. YBCO windings based HFT contributes to transfer approximately 11.76% more power compared to that of using the copper winding. Â© 2020 IEEE.

TI  - The energyscape of the lower Thames and Medway: Britainâ€™s changing patterns of energy use
AB  - This article examines the history of the energy landscape â€” the energyscape â€” of the lower River Thames and Medway from the 1860s to the present. It explores why, and in what ways, the energy industries have exploited the area and its landscape. Key factors include its accessibility for ocean-going shipping; the proximity to energy consumers in London and south-east England; the availability of large areas of land; and water resources. The energy industries included oil storage and refining; petrochemicals; gas manufacture and handling; and electricity generation and distribution. The article argues that the development of energy infrastructure in the Thames/ Medway landscape reflects the shifting patterns of energy use in the UK. For example, the recent demolition of Grain and Kingsnorth power stations â€” prominent north Kent landmarks since the 1970s â€” exemplifies the decline of coal and oil as primary fuels for electricity generation. Similarly, the seascape of the outer Thames estuary has been transformed by the advent of renewable energy and the construction of four major offshore wind farms. The article demonstrates how patterns of energy use are a mosaic of social needs, technological capabilities, environmental concerns, political expediency, and economic forces. The Thames/ Medway energyscape has developed, evolved and been adapted to these influences, and continues to support the energy needs of the UK economy.

TI  - Numerical simulation for evaluation of primary energy conversion of floating OWC-type wave energy converter
AB  - In order to design a floating OWC-type wave energy converter such as Backward Bent Duct Buoy (BBDB) optimally, it is necessary to develop the numerical method in time domain considering motions of BBDB, air flow in air chamber and rotation of air turbine and mooring system in waves. In this paper, as the first step to develop this numerical method, firstly, equations of motion of a floating OWC-type wave energy converter in waves using the impulse response matrix by body velocity and air pressure in air chamber are shown. Secondly, calculation results in frequency domain by 3D boundary element method for a diffraction problem and radiation problems by forced motion with unit body velocity and unit air pressure in air chamber for BBDB are shown. Experiments on exciting forces and radiation forces for heave and pitch mode are also carried out and calculation results are compared with experimental results.

TI  - Statistical uncertainty analysis in the long-term distribution of wind- and wave-induced hot-spot stress for fatigue design of jacket wind turbine based on time domain simulations
AB  - The statistical uncertainty of the long-term distribution of wind- and wave-induced hot-spot stress ranges in multi-planar tubular joints of a fixed jacket offshore wind turbine designed for a North Sea site in a water depth of 70m has been assessed in this paper. The dynamic response of the jacket support structure due to wind and wave loads is calculated using a decoupled procedure. Hot-spot stresses at failure-critical locations of each reference brace for 4 different tubular joints (DK, DKT, X-type) are derived by summation of the single stress components from axial, in-plane and out-plane action. The effects of planar and non-planar braces are also considered. A two-parameter Weibull function is used to fit the long-term statistical distribution of hot-spot stress ranges by combination of time domain simulation for representative environmental conditions (wind / sea states) in operational condition of the wind turbine. The statistical uncertainty of the Weibull distribution of hot-spot stress ranges and the two parameters defining the Weibull distribution is assessed, based on 20 simulations for each representative environmental condition. The contributions to the uncertainty from wind loads and wave loads are analyzed by considering 3 different load cases: wind loads only, wave loads only and combination of wind and wave loads. The sensitivity of the long-term distribution of hot-spot stress ranges due to their stress components is also assessed. Copyright Â© 2011 by ASME.

TI  - Analysis of impact loads on a self-elevating unit during jacking operation
AB  - The renewable energy resource of offshore wind is believed to have a great potential in playing an essential role on the future energy market in Europe, but there are complications such as harsh weather and low accessibility. To manage this, most offshore wind turbines of today are installed and maintained using self-elevating units (SEUs). In this study, a method is presented that enables the analysis of weather window assessments for the installation and retrieval phases of a SEU. The method of analysis takes site-specific parameters, defined as soil type and water depth, into account in addition to vesselspecific and environmental parameters. The inclusion of sitespecific parameters is the novel contribution compared to assessment methodologies used today. A simulation model is presented that incorporates a coupled non-linear time-domain analysis of vessel motion and soil-structure interaction. Soil deformation behaviour during impact is described by resistance curves based on a bearing capacity theory. A structural evaluation criterion against which impact forces are compared is used for weather window assessments. The simulation model is applied on a case study utilizing different soil types to study impact forces and the capacity of the structure for withstanding such impacts and eventually performing a weather window assessment. The results show that the jacking operation can be divided into two phases when it comes to loads on the spudcan: a phase dominated by vertical forces followed by a phase dominated by horizontal forces. It is found that including soil deformation behaviour is of paramount importance to the magnitude of the resulting impact forces and that classrecommended practice does indeed produce rather large force estimates. Thus, assessments where site-specific parameters are incorporated could definitely increase the operable weather window for SEUs, and, consequently, increase the economic competitiveness of, for example, the offshore wind industry.

TI  - Ocean and Geothermal Energy Systems
AB  - This paper presents techno-economic summaries of ocean wave, tidal and current, ocean thermal, and geothermal energy, including grid interface characteristics. These forms of energy represent a significant opportunity to complement diversified energy conversion portfolios. Ocean wave energy conversion relies on the capture of kinetic and potential energy in moving and elevated water in an ocean wave. Tidal and current technology converts the kinetic energy in moving water, much like a wind turbine. Ocean thermal converts the energy available in the temperature gradient of warm surface water and cold deep water. Last, geothermal conversion utilizes the hot rock and water deep within the Earth. The total global average wave resource is estimated at approximately 2000 GW, with approximately 300 GW in the United States. The total global tidal resource is estimated at approximately 1000 GW, with 50 GW in the United States. The marine current resource estimate for the Florida Current in the southeast United States is estimated at 5 GW. Ocean thermal has a global capacity estimate of 5000 GW. Last, the global conventional hydrothermal geothermal capacity estimate is approximately 200 GW, but with much more possible through enhanced geothermal systems. For cost, it was found that the long-term projected wave energy conversion cost is $0.10-0.15/kWh. The long-term projected tidal cost is found to be $0.025-0.25/kWh. Ocean thermal long-term cost is projected at $0.10-0.18/kWh. And last, geothermal, being more closely aligned with traditional thermal generation, is estimated at $0.03/kWh to $0.15/kWh.

TI  - Modelling and measuring flow and wind turbine wakes in large wind farms offshore
AB  - Average power losses due to wind turbine wakes are of the order of 10 to 20% of total power output in large offshore wind farms. Accurately quantifying power losses due to wakes is, therefore, an important part of overall wind farm economics. The focus of this research is to compare different types of models from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to wind farm models in terms of how accurately they represent wake losses when compared with measurements from offshore wind farms. The ultimate objective is to improve modelling of flow for large wind farms in order to optimize wind farm layouts to reduce power losses due to wakes and loads. The research presented is part of the EC-funded UpWind project, which aims to radically improve wind turbine and wind farm models in order to continue to improve the costs of wind energy. Reducing wake losses, or even reduce uncertainties in predicting power losses from wakes, contributes to the overall goal of reduced costs. Here, we assess the state of the art in wake and flow modelling for offshore wind farms, the focus so far has been cases at the Horns Rev wind farm, which indicate that wind farm models require modification to reduce under-prediction of wake losses while CFD models typically over-predict wake losses. Further investigation is underway to determine the causes of these discrepancies. CopyrightÂ© 2009 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.

TI  - A survey of tourist attitudes to renewable energy supply in Australian hotel accommodation
AB  - The results of a survey are presented describing the attitudes of Australian tourists to micro-generation renewable energy supply (RES) for hotel accommodation. The average positive response rate to all questions was above 50%, implying a desire by tourists for environmentally friendly accommodation and renewable energy supply. Tourists indicated that they perceived RES to be reliable and expressed a willingness to cooperate with RES initiatives and possible resultant inconveniences. However, there were mixed opinions with regard to consumer willingness to pay for the product. Of the 49% of respondents who were willing to pay extra for RES, 92% replied they would pay between 1% and 5%. Analysis of the variation in response due to accommodation type revealed a 'city' hotel versus 'eco-resort' difference. Likewise, a breakdown of responses according to country of origin indicated that Australians had a more positive attitude to RES than overseas visitors, including Japanese and Americans. While no variation in response was detected according to gender, age had a measurable bearing on response, with older guests returning a higher positive response rate. Visual queue questions querying aesthetic opinions and 'not-in-my-backyard' (NIMBY) attitude to RES revealed that there was virtually no opposition to photovoltaics. Opinions regarding wind energy conversion systems (WECS) varied with type and location, with rooftop WECS receiving more acceptance than stand-alone varieties. A high level of visual acceptance was shown by respondents for onshore wind farms located close to a tourist accommodation centre, with less enthusiasm for offshore farms. A strong NIMBY attitude to WECS was not observed among Australian or local respondents. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Integrating structural health and condition monitoring: A cost benefit analysis for offshore wind energy
AB  - There is a large financial incentive to minimise operations and maintenance (O&M) costs for offshore wind power by optimising the maintenance plan. The integration of condition monitoring (CM) and structural health monitoring (SHM) may help realise this. There is limited work on the integration of both CM and SHM for offshore wind power or the use of imperfectly operating monitoring equipment. In order to investigate this, a dynamic Bayesian network and limit state equations are coupled with Monte Carlo simulations to deteriorate components in a wind farm. The CM system has a 'deterioration window' allowing for the possible detection of faults up to 6 months in advance. The SHM system model uses a reduction in the probability of failure factor to account for lower modelling uncertainties. A case study is produced that shows a reduction in operating costs and also a reduction in risk. The lifetime levelised costs are reduced by approximately 6%. Â© 2015 by ASME.

TI  - Energy Production Benefits by Wind and Wave Energies for the Autonomous System of Crete
AB  - At autonomous electricity grids Renewable Energy (RE) contributes significantly to energy production. Offshore resources benefit from higher energy density, smaller visual impacts, and higher availability levels. Offshore locations at the West of Crete obtain wind availability â‰ˆ80%, combining this with the installation potential for large scale modern wind turbines (rated power) then expected annual benefits are immense. Temporal variability of production is a limiting factor for wider adaptation of large offshore farms. To this end multi-generation with wave energy can alleviate issues of non-generation for wind. Spatio-temporal correlation of wind and wave energy production exhibit that wind and wave hybrid stations can contribute significant amounts of clean energy, while at the same time reducing spatial constrains and public acceptance issues. Offshore technologies can be combined as co-located or not, altering contribution profiles of wave energy to non-operating wind turbine production. In this study a co-located option contributes up to 626 h per annum, while a non co-located solution is found to complement over 4000 h of a non-operative wind turbine. Findings indicate the opportunities associated not only in terms of capital expenditure reduction, but also in the ever important issue of renewable variability and grid stability.

TI  - Optimization of large offshore wind farm layout considering reliability and wake effect
AB  - Nowadays, the increasing demand of electricity and environmental hazards of the greenhouse gas lead to the requirement of renewable energies. The wind energy has been proved as one of the most successful sustainable energies. Recently, the development trend of the wind energy is to build large offshore wind farms (OWFs) with hundreds of wind turbines, which could generates more power in one wind farm. In the large OWF, the wake effect is a very important impact factor to the wind farms, especially for those with close spacing. Therefore, the wind farm layout, the location of the wind turbines (WTs) is very essential to the performance of the whole wind farm, especially for large OWFs. In this research, we focus on the optimization of the large OWF layout by considering performance of the OWF, such as the total output energy. Firstly, the model for wind farm performance evaluation is established by incorporating historical wind speed data and the wake effect which can affect the total wind farm output. Then, by using the metaheuristic algorithms, the genetic algorithm(GA), the OWF layout is optimized.

TI  - Primary frequency regulation of a microgrid by deloaded tidal turbines
AB  - In recent years, mindset of people is observed much more inclined towards the usage of renewable energy systems because of the environmentally friendly nature and the monetary advantages of fuel saving. However, since non-conventional sources are unpredictable in nature, consequently high penetration of these sources causes reliability and power quality issues. It inspires researchers to redefine or develop the frequency regulation strategies. This paper introduces a fractional-order control methodology to adapt the primary frequency regulation from deloaded tidal power generators on the basis of existing power constraints. It is ameliorated by inertia and damping control, primary frequency control, and supplementary frequency control of the system. The control processes are implemented through fractional controllers.The parameters of fractional controllers are tuned by imperialist competitive algorithm. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed controller, simulated outcomes are evaluated with conventional controller. Besides this, the ICA-based controller results are also compared with other algorithms such as particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm. An improvement in performance index from 16.11 to 22.80% is reported with proposed control strategy. Â© 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - New power solutions
AB  - A selection of lights and motors and an array of power-using devices are continually being investigated to generate and distribute the power required by electric devices. Supply of power to these devices is provided by generating power through hydroelectric dams, nuclear, gas or coal, solar, wind, tidal, and geothermal power. A group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is developing a concept based on power radiation towers and have experimented on a smaller scale system that would power devices on a room-by-room basis. Toshiba is working on a nuclear battery design called 4S super safe, small and simple, which uses a sodium-cooled, breeder-reactor design to produce up to 30 megawatts of power. Improvements in energy efficiency and better use of sources of energy is aimed to address the power requirements needs.

TI  - OPTIMIZATION OF WIND TURBINE ARRAY PERFORMANCE IN OFFSHORE WIND FARMS
AB  - An improved program of previous optimization work is put forward for analyzing and optimizing the spatial configurations of wind turbines in offshore wind arrays. It applies Ainslie s' wake model in which the wake profile is dependent on wind speed, turbulence intensities and the turbine's thrust coefficient. Models of single wakes and multiple wakes are employed. Weibull distributions and turbulence intensities of wind are applied. A real wind turbine power curve is used to estimate power out of the turbines. The annual power output of the wind array for the North Sea's Horns Rev wind array is evaluated and compared with the optimization results. Disagreement is observed between the simulated results using different angular discretizations of the possible wind directional probabilities. An analysis and possible explanation are discussed

TI  - Reduction of wind turbine power fluctuation by using priority flow divider valve in a hydraulic power transmission
AB  - This work proposes a novel approach to obtain a nearly constant power output from an offshore wind turbine by incorporating a priority flow divider valve and an accumulator into the power hydraulic system. The priority flow divider valve allows flow in two different ways, i.e. priority line and by-pass line, simultaneously. It controls the fluid (seawater) flow by adjusting its priority port flow as per the user setting to ensure minimum fluctuation of power output, whereas the excess flow is passed through the by-pass port and stored in an accumulator. A control strategy is applied on the control valve to allow the flow from the accumulator to the nozzle as per demand. A mathematical model of wind turbine with hydraulic power transmission is developed by using bond graph technique, which is suitable for this multi-energy domain system. Simulation results show that the output from the wind turbine is stabilized by using the proposed hydraulic power transmission system under fluctuating wind speed. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Model Tests on Characteristic of Suction Caissons in Saturated Fine Sand under Intermittent Loading
AB  - Suction caissons are often used for the caissons of both offshore oil platforms and offshore wind power projects because of their advantages of simple construction, economical cost, and reusability. In this study, model tests were conducted in sand in order to investigate the effects of the caisson installation method on the penetration depth and the critical suction. Results of the test program showed that the method of changing the frequency of suction during different stages of the process can increase the penetration depth of the caisson. Combining with the deformation of the soil body inside and outside the caisson, the existing method for calculating the critical suction is modified, and the critical suction calculation equation of the discontinuous penetration test is proposed. Based on the test results, the calculation equation of the soil heave height can be more accurate predicted. The analysis results verify that the calculation method and the actual results are in good agreement. Â© 2019 Ping Shi, published by Sciendo 2019.

TI  - GECCO Ocean Energy System
AB  - In today's world the oil and gas industries play major roles in energy consumption. Nations depend heavily on these resources despite their major disadvantage: They are not renewable. As the demand for renewable energy increases, it is necessary to identify new energy sources and to invent ways of harvesting these energies by designing new systems. The ocean is a major resource for all types of materials, supplies, as well as energy; however the exploration of wave energy as a resource is still in its infancy. The Florida Institute of Technology has constructed an alternative energy system independent of non-renewable resources, such as oil and gas. The GECCO (Green Energy Coastal Collection Operation) is a wave energy converter that extracts kinetic energy from ocean waves using a rugged, innovative mechanical multi-system.

TI  - Performance analysis of coastal wind farms in Jiangsu, China
AB  - The operational performances of coastal wind farms, located at the east coast of Jiangsu Province of China, are reported in this paper. The result shows that although a rich wind resources predicted in this area, a strong variation of wind resources characteristics are observed between wind farms. Annual averaged wind speeds of five wind farms at hub height range from 4.8 to 6.6 m/s. In addition, the wind shear coefficient shows largely different although they appear to agree with coastal region characteristics. Ru Dong not only has the highest wind shear coefficient but also a largest range of wind shear coefficient variation amplitude. The Capacity Factors of the selected wind farms range from 16% to 27%. Ru Dong shows a lowest Capacity Factor of 16% which may due to the low average wind speed and high wind shear coefficient. On the contrary, Da Feng has a lower Capacity Factor with sensible wind resources indicating either an improved wind turbine technology or an optimized wind farm operational maintenance is needed to increase wind farm efficiency. The result obtained in this paper provides valuable information for future offshore wind farm development in China. Â© (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

TI  - On the functional design of an offshore wind maintenance support vessel
AB  - The majority of the vessels that are currently used in the support of the Operation & Maintenance (O&M) phase of offshore wind farms are vessels not specifically designed for the tasks they should fulfil. Due to the inbuilt inefficiencies of the chartered vessels this collides with the industries ambition to reduce costs. Furthermore ship designers and shipyards tend to create evolutionary designs rather than revolutionary designs which in this case often results in an optimisation of ill-fitting vessel concepts. This paper elaborates on the design process that is initiated to prepare the concept design that suits the offshore O&M needs based on functional requirements rather than making a specification based modification to an existing design. This led to a revolutionary design unlike any of the commonly found solutions by incorporating the actual functional requirements, work- and logistical flows specifically for the offshore O&M market.

TI  - Genetic optimisation for a stochastic model for opportunistic maintenance planning of offshore wind farms
AB  - The cost incurred from operations and maintenance activity for offshore wind turbines contributes significantly to the overall lifecycle cost for offshore wind farms. This work addresses the issue of identifying a near-optimal schedule for the planning of operations and maintenance activity for the turbines in an offshore wind farm. Significant cost savings can be realized by scheduling maintenance tasks at times of predicted low power production. This research implements a rolling horizon stochastic model and applies meta-heuristic optimization techniques to identify a near-optimal schedule for the opportunistic maintenance of wind farms. Empirical evaluation of the proposed approach produces schedules that achieve a cost saving in the range of 13-21% over standard techniques. Â© 2016 IEEE.

TI  - Emerging triboelectric nanogenerators for ocean wave energy harvesting: state of the art and future perspectives
AB  - A triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a new energy harvester that converts small scale mechanical motions into electrical energy by a combination of triboelectrification and electrostatic induction through the periodic contact-separation and/or sliding movement between two tribo-materials with different abilities of gaining or losing electrical charges. This new approach to harvest mechanical energy can produce high power outputs capable of supplying equipment and sensors deployed in remote offshore locations and of supporting offshore activities whilst being able to be used in conjunction with traditional energy harvesting technologies. This review describes the fundamentals of TENGs and the existing energy harvesting modes, with focus on those more suitable for marine applications. Moreover, the equipment and offshore activities whose energy needs can be satisfied by TENGs are described and implementation schemes presented. We conclude that TENGs have high potential for numerous maritime applications, ranging from the demand of electronics used for metocean monitoring, signalling and surveillance, to activities such as offshore aquaculture or oil and gas exploration. The advantages of such systems as an alternative to currently existing solutions are also discussed, along with insights concerning applications that can take advantage of their high efficiency harvesting low amplitude and low frequency wave energy.

TI  - Influence of manufacturing aspects on fatigue assessment
AB  - Within the optimisation process of using offshore wind energy one essential part is the support structure. About 45% of the total costs are required for the fabrication and installation of these structures. This high percentage shows the potential for decreasing investment costs of offshore wind farms by improving fabrication methods in the future. Within the research project GIGAWIND alpha ventus funded by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, optimization by a holistic design concept for support structures of offshore wind turbines shall be demonstrated. Most of the German wind farms planned in the North Sea are located in water depths of more than 30 m. Therefore lattice structures like tripods, tripiles or jackets show the most advantageous behaviour. Tripods and jackets are also chosen at the German offshore test field alpha ventus. Regarding from the engineers' and manufacturers' point of view the effort increases significantly. In particular the many welded connections are not only the most time consuming working stages for the assembly but also critical details concerning the ultimate and fatigue limit state in design. The currently applied structural and fatigue assessment of support structures for Offshore Wind Turbines is based on common design rules, which treat structures as limited and isolated. This means that varying aspects of material qualities, manufacturing and loading are considered by high safety factors which may result in conservatively designed, too heavy and expensive structures. But for manufacturers a change to serial production of support structures is necessary to accommodate the high demand and to stay competitive on the international market. Series production means the chance to improve the quality of the products by a systematic development of facilities accompanying quality management system. Focusing on the influence of manufacturing aspects, parameters like geometry tolerances and aspects of welding like distortions were measured during the manufacturing in order to get more information about their development during the production process and their influence on fatigue critical stress concentration at welded nodes. After analysing different measurement techniques, terrestrial laser scanning and tachymetry were favoured as fast and most practicable. The preparation is easy and the measurement time is short. Both techniques were applied during two separate field campaigns. Tachymetry is applied by Fraunhofer-IWES. Terrestrial laser scanning was used in the joint campaign of the Institute for Steel Construction and the Geodetic Institute of the Leibniz University Hannover. Terrestrial laser scanning is a method to acquire geometric properties of surfaces with high temporal and spatial resolution using laser technology. The purpose of laser scanning is usually to generate a 3D point cloud which represents the surface of the subject. Afterwards these points are used to obtain the shape of the subject. Fast and efficient algorithms were developed for interpreting and editing the mound of measurement data for further analyses. Theoretical investigations and FE-analyses expand the field of parameters and show the relevance of imperfections for the design.

TI  - Modeling ocean waves and investigation of oceanic wave spectra for wave-to-wire system
AB  - The oceanic wave energy is a profuse and sustainable source of clean energy but its enourmous potential is under-exploited. Even though the idea of energy harnessing from oceanic waves is not new, the developments in wave energy conversion technologies are still in an embryonic stage. In most of the studies associated to wave-to-wire systems, oceanic waves are taken as regular waves with a fixed amplitude and a fixed frequency. The main area of focus of the previous studies includes the different conversion stages of the wave-to-wire system, particularly the mechanical, and the electrical conversion stage of the energy and the modeling of oceanic waves for such studies remained neglected in such studies. However, the actual oceanic waves can be presented with the sum of various frequencies to show a specific sea-states with significant wave height and the peak period as the main characterizing parameters. In this study, detailed mathematical modeling of oceanic waves is offered and various wave spectra are investigated for their application in wave-to-wire-based system studies. The best-suited wave spectra are identified parametrically and thereafter it is used for the generation of wave elevation time series in the proposed method presented in this study. The generated time series are appliesd in wave-to-wire systems for the investigation of wave energy conversion devices to mimic the real sea environment. Based on inverse fast Fourier transforms, oceanic wave elevation time series are determined which will be acting as input data for any of the wave energy converters deployed for the capturing of useable energy.

TI  - Calculation of Lebanon offshore wind energy potential using ERA5 reanalysis: Impact of seasonal air density changes
AB  - In this work, data from the ERA5 reanalysis (2010-2017) have been used to estimate the seasonal offshore wind energy potential for the Lebanese coast. Additionally, for this estimation, the effect of seasonal changes of air density has been incorporated. As a reference, the SIEMENS 160/6 turbine has been adopted and wind energy potential has been expressed as the capacity factor (CF) associated to this turbine. The spatial distribution of CF provides an idea of available wind energy potential in the Lebanese coast. The impact of seasonal air density changes has been assessed as percentage reduction in this indicator. In summer, the CF reduction due to high temperatures and lower air density, reaches in some Southern regions of the Lebanese coast to values around 5.5%. The use of such reanalyses is likely to increase in the future, thus making consultancy work easier since a lot of computational work with state-of-The-Art meteorological models like WRF or MC2 (used to draw the National Wind Atlas of Lebanon) may not be necessary. Therefore, most likely in the future, for wind potential estimations, rather than heavy calculation efforts, the know-how for consultancy companies will focus into deeper analysis and interpretation of readily-Available data from reanalyses.

TI  - Fluctuations of offshore wind generation - Statistical modeling
AB  - The magnitude of power fluctuations at large offshore wind farms has a significant impact on the control and management strategies of their power output. If focusing on the minute scale, one observes successive periods with smaller and larger power fluctuations. It seems that different regimes yield different behaviours of the wind power output. This paper concentrates on the statistical modelling of offshore power fluctuations, with particular emphasis on regime-switching models. More precisely, Self-Exciting Threshold AutoRegressive (SE- TAR), Smooth Transition AutoRegressive (STAR) and Markov- Switching AutoRegressive (MSAR) models are considered. The particularities of these models are presented, as well as methods for the estimation of their parameters. Simulation results are given for the case of the Horns Rev and Nysted offshore wind farms in Denmark, for time-series of power production averaged at a 1, 5, and 10-minute rate. The exercise consists in one-step ahead forecasting of these time-series with the various regime-switching models. It is shown that the MSAR model, for which the succession of regimes is represented by a hidden Markov chain, significantly outperforms the other models, for which the rules for the regime-switching are explicitly formulated.

TI  - Challenges in All-DC Offshore Wind Power Plants
AB  - As the size and distance from shore of new offshore wind power plants (OWPPs) increase, connection to shore using high-voltage (HV) direct-current (DC) technology becomes more cost-effective. Currently, every offshore wind power plant has a collection system based on medium-voltage alternating-current technology. Such systems rely on heavy and bulky low-frequency (i.e., 50 or 60 Hz) transformers: a drawback offshore, where equipment weight and space are restricted. Consequently, there is growing interest in medium-voltage direct-current collection systems, in which low-frequency transformers are replaced with DC/DC converters equipped with lighter and smaller medium-frequency transformers. However, the deployment of all-DC OWPPs still faces several challenges. Based on a very comprehensive and critical literature review, three of them are identified and discussed in this paper. The first challenge is the technological gap at component level. In this work, the DC/DC converter topologies most suitable for application to OWPPs are described and compared. The second challenge is the controllability of DC collection systems. Parallel, series and hybrid DC collection system layouts are presented and discussed. The third challenge is the compliance of all-DC OWPPs with current requirements for their connection to the onshore grids. The three challenges are discussed to highlight current research gaps and potential future directions.</p>

TI  - Flow visualization studies over S-blades
AB  - A fully reversible axial flow pump-turbine is a device that works both as a pump and as a turbine for both directions of flow. Such devices find application in tidal power plants. Double-cambered S-Blade profiles have been found to give better performance for this purpose. An S-Blade profile has convex and concave curvatures on both upper and lower surfaces, making the flow very complicated even at small angles of attack. In the present investigation, flow visualization studies have been carried out to get better insight into the behavior of flow over S-Blade profiles. The medium used is water, and fine aluminium powder was used as the tracer. Studies have been carried out to get the influence of maximum camber and maximum thickness at angles of attack varying from - 8Â° to + 8Â°. Copyright Â© 1998 by Begell House, Inc.

TI  - A case study of multi-use offshore platforms
AB  - This work represents a theoretical case study of a multi-use platform (MUP). It is part of an on-going EU funded collaborative research project (MERMAID). European offshore wind farms aim to approach a capacity of 150 GW by 2030. Such ambition will require a seabed area of approximate 4000 to 5000 km2 but with a small physical footprint (including cables) of 300 to 400 km2. Theoretically, the remaining space can be used for other purposes such as aquaculture and wave energy. Accordingly, MERMAID aims at the multi-use of ocean space for energy extraction, aquaculture and platform related transport. This case study presents an innovative proof of concept to integrate aquaculture and wave energy technology at offshore wind farms. The proposed MUP case includes marine energy extraction (1000 MW wind farm plus a wave farm), an aquaculture farm, and the installation, operation and maintenance technologies for the MUP. The synergies and the disadvantages of the MUP compared to the offshore wind farm will be evaluated during the installation, operation, and maintenance phases.

TI  - Application of the findings of the PISA joint industry project in the design of monopile foundations for a North Sea wind farm
AB  - Monopiles are the most common foundation type in the offshore wind industry. Their design is largely dependent on the ability to accurately model the soil-structure response of the foundation, with more refined modelling approaches enabling significant reductions in required embedment depth, fabrication cost and installation risk. The PISA joint industry project (JIP) has been completed in recent years with the objectives of developing a more refined soil-structure response modelling method compared to other available methods such as the API p-y curve approach. The scope of this paper is to detail how the PISA recommendations have been implemented on a real offshore wind farm project located in the UK North Sea, identifying how the findings can be incorporated into a combined geotechnical and structural analysis approach to enable efficient serial design of multiple foundations for wind turbines. The paper presents how existing design processes and criteria can be modified to take into account the recommendations of the PISA JIP for use in design. Discussion will be provided on the following procedures: calibration of the PISA 1-D soil response formulations to site specific conditions; the combination of the homogeneous sand and clay formulations to accurately model soil-structure response in layered soil profiles; and, consideration of the effects of cyclic loading in conjunction with the use of the PISA monotonic soil response formulations. Results will be presented to demonstrate the calibration of the PISA 1-D soil response formulations to a layered soil site. Discussion will also be provided on the significant monopile lengths savings achieved when using a PISA approach compared to an API p-y curve approach. The monopile mass reduction will be illustrated against trends derived from installed monopiles. Observations will be provided on how the use of a PISA based approach can affect the governing design cases and how this is likely to impact on monopile design for future projects. Discussions and conclusions will also be presented on the challenges of implementing the PISA recommendations in monopile design for real projects and what additional work is required to enable further costs savings in implementing the new design approach. The PISA JIP recommendations are the cutting edge in monopile foundation design. The paper will provide discussion on how these recommendations can be effectively implemented in design based on experience from the foundation design for a real offshore wind farm. The wind farm in question will be one of the first constructed for which foundations have been designed using a PISA based method, demonstrating the significant CAPEX savings possible using the PISA approach.

Journal of Coastal Research, Si 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 496 - 500. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208 Although still in an early stage, offshore wind development is now characterized by a boom process. This leads to the necessity of applying an integral management model for the design of offshore wind facilities, being the purpose of the model to achieve technical, economical and environmental viability, all within a sustainable development framework. The foregoing led to the research project exposed in this paper, consisting of drawing up an offshore wind farms methodological proposal; this methodology has a global and/or general nature or point of view whilst searching for optimization of the overall process of operations leading to the design of this type of installations and establishing collated theoretical bases for the further development of management tools. This methodological proposal follows a classical engineering thought scheme: it begins with the alternatives study, and ends with the detailed design. With this in mind, the paper includes the following sections: introduction, methodology used for the research project, conditioning factors, methodological proposal for the design of offshore wind farms, checking the methodological proposal, and conclusions.

TI  - Flow-induced vibration marine current energy harvesting using a centrally-pivoted cylinder
AB  - The phenomenon of vortex-induced vibration (VIV) for elastically restrained cylindrical structures in cross-flows is relatively well investigated. The utility of this mechanism in harvesting energy from marine current and tidal flows is however arguably still in its infancy. With relatively few moving components, a flow-induced vibration based energy conversion device augers low complexity compared to the commonly employed turbine design. Despite the interest in this concept, a practical device has yet to emerge. It is desirable for optimal system performance to design for a very low mass or mass moment of inertia ratio. The device operating range in particular is maximised below the vortex-induced vibration critical point where an infinite resonant response region is realised. An unfortunate consequence of this requirement is large buoyancy forces that need to be mitigated by gravity-based, suctioncaisson or anchor mooring systems. The focus of this paper is the testing of a novel VIV marine current energy-harvesting configuration that utilises a centrally-pivoted horizontal cylinder. The results of experimental investigations, utilising the University of Wollongong fluid mechanics laboratory towing tank, are analysed and presented. A reduced velocity test range of 0 to 27 was covered. Power take-off (PTO) damping ratios spanning from 0.041 to 0.392 were examined in order to determine the optimal conditions and hence the maximum device energy conversion efficiency.

TI  - New energy development and utilization of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation
AB  - Oil belongs to nonrenewable resources. With the oil supply relatively limited and the global economy enters a fast development cycle and oil demand is increasing, oil prices rising is inevitable. Impact of high oil prices is deep and continuous, will change our country's energy production and consumption structure. As China's largest offshore oil and gas producers, China's CNOOC must take positive and correct development strategy, and energetically develop and use of in the new energy, and provide high quality energy for our country's economic and social development. This paper expounds some effort in the field of new energy development and utilization of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation(CNOOC), mainly including wind power development, bio-fuels development, natural gas hydrate recover and so on. With the arrival of the 21st century, the global economy entering a period of rapid growth of all countries, and the demand for energy has also risen sharply. Because all sorts of fossil fuel are non-renewable resources, we are in urgent need of development and utilization of new energy, and increase the new energy's proportion in the total amount. Therefore, CNOOC as one of the domestic three big oil companies under the guidance of scientific development view and the national development strategy requirements, build the new energy pillar industry, promote energy conservation and emissions reduction and adjustment of industrial structure, and provide green energy. New energy is expected to be the backbone industry of CNOOC in the 10~15 years. CNOOC develop new energy, following a general idea is that unified planning, implement step by step, progressively with breakthroughs made in key areas and advance steady. (1) Focus on developing wind power industry: first to construction and operation land wind farms, next to vigorously promote the development of offshore wind power; and actively carrying out the development of new type sea fan. It will make CNOOC became the main force of China's wind development and operation on the sea. (2) Developing bio-fuels steady, building an industry chain, first demonstrate pilot, and than extend. Bio-fuels is also an important part of the new energy. Using of bio-fuels is still in the start level, so we should promote the development and production gradually and steady. (3) First carry out the pilot study of natural gas hydrate. Natural gas hydrate is the leading new energy in the 21st century.

TI  - Component analysis for hydrostatic transmission for wave energy application - Simulation and validation
AB  - Marine waves have the potential of playing a significant role in future energy production. Most converter prototypes utilise a hydrostatic transmission or Power-Take Off (PTO) to convert the mechanical motion of an oscillating body to generate electrical power. A test rig has been installed at the Institute for Fluid Power Drives and Controls (IFAS) together with Aquamarine Power and Bosch Rexroth. Currently a new PTO is tested with this test rig. This new PTO is called WavePOD and is intended to become an industry wide standard by providing flexibility to suit a range of different wave energy converters. Accordingly, it is planned that, different to former PTOs proposed, WavePOD is not designed for only one wave energy converter, but can be used with minor adaptions for various types. Thus, it is aimed to achieve economies of scale, decreasing WavePOD's costs in comparison to other PTOs. Within this paper important components of the hydraulic transmission such as cylinders, check valves, accumulators and pressure relief valves are investigated in terms of their characteristic behaviour during operation. For the various components the simulation model is presented and validated with test results. Thereby the focus is on dynamic behaviour and power losses. The results will enable to monitor the components behaviour during operation without requiring a surplus of sensor data. Â© Copyright 2015 by ASME.

TI  - Numerical Assessment of Tidal Stream Energy Resource in Langyatai Strait
AB  - In the present work, the tidal stream energy resource in Langyatai (LYT) strait was calculated based on tidal current velocity. To obtain the tidal current velocity, a tidal current numerical model was setup and validated by measurements of tidal current in 2 points around LYT strait with observing period of 25 hours in spring tide. The calculated tidal current velocities agree well with the measured velocities, which shows the reliability of the model. The characteristics of tidal currents around LYT were analyzed and the following tidal stream energy density was calculated: The velocity category interval containing maximum energy potential for LYT strait is 1.5 similar to 1.6m/s and the power for the entire section of the strait is 1.927 MW.

TI  - Tidal energy extraction in three-dimensional ocean models
AB  - Access to high performance computing has made 3-D modelling de rigueur for tidal energy resource assessments. Advances in computing resources and numerical model codes have enabled high resolution 3-D ocean models to be applied at basin scales, albeit at a much higher computational cost than the traditional 2-D modelling approach. Here, a comparison between 2-D and 3-D tidal energy extraction modelling techniques is undertaken within a 3-D modelling framework, and differences between the methods are examined from both resource and impact assessment perspectives. Through a series of numerical experiments using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), it is shown that 3-D tidal energy extraction can be successfully incorporated in a regional ocean model of the Pentland Firth- one of the top regions in the world for tidal stream energy development. We demonstrate that resolving 3-D flow is important for reducing uncertainty in environmental resource assessments. Further, our results show that 2-D tidal energy extraction methods lead to a misrepresentation of the velocity profile when applied to 3-D models, demonstrating the importance of resolving 3-D flows in the vicinity of tidal arrays.

TI  - Tidal turbine blades: Design and dynamic loads estimation using CFD and blade element momentum theory
AB  - The interest in tidal power is constantly increasing thanks to its high predictability, the huge potential of tides and the actual need for renewable energy. It explains the emergence of many tidal turbine designs, especially in Europe, often inspired from wind turbines. All of them are at a more or less early stage of development. But because of the high density of water, environmental drag forces are very large compared with wind turbines of the same capacity. Therefore the knowledge acquired by the wind industry is certainly qualitatively useful, but it has to be reconsidered to be applicable to tidal turbines. The aim of the project presented in this paper is to create a 1 MW reference tidal turbine, whose small-scaled model has been tested in the towing tank of Marintek laboratory (Trondheim, Norway). The tests focused on dynamic loads, which are an important reason of failure, and thus will help tidal turbine designers in their work by gaining valuable experience in turbine performance in various operating conditions. The chosen turbine has a horizontal axis and two blades, which have been designed using the blade element momentum theory for a diameter of 20m. This paper states the project issues and the method used to design the blades, from the hydrodynamic properties of the hydrofoils to the computational fluid dynamic analysis. The tests on the small scaled model makes it possible to validate the concept and a comparison between efficiencies obtained analytically, experimentally and with CFD computation has been performed in this paper. The maximum power coefficient experimentally obtained is 0.427, i.e. 1.4% higher than the power coefficient obtained numerically. The blade element momentum theory is then used to estimate the loads on each blade when the rotor is subjected to regular waves of many heights and periods, with the intention of ranking the parameters of importance and introducing a fatigue analysis.

TI  - Fault Tolerant Multi-kW DC Transformer Structure for Wind Farms
AB  - This paper proposes a fault tolerant LC resonant DC/DC converter for offshore wind farm applications. A multi-terminal wind energy conversion system of three wind turbine units connected in parallel configuration for HVDC application is investigated. The design and modelling of the proposed system are addressed. The main aim of the LC circuit is to maintain the steady state fault current at rated value. This results in protecting the converter semiconductors. In such case, the permanent fault current can be interrupted by the AC mechanical circuit breaker. Moreover, it not required any more to protect the antiparallel diode by connecting thyristor in parallel. The aforementioned design solutions are confirmed and verified by detailed simulations using MATLAB/SIMULINK software. The simulation includes grid integration and interaction between the wind turbine units.

TI  - Graphical analysis of day - Night temperature difference by interpolation and approximation methods for the energy converter of the environment
AB  - Today, a lot of attention is paid to the search for environmentally friendly renewable energy sources. The most frequently considered such energy sources are wind energy, solar technology, the use of the energy of sea waves and biomass. Each of them has a drawback that prevents its widespread adoption. For example, wind farms create noise during their operation, are rigidly tied to the place where there are acceptable wind resources. To date, an energy converter has been developed, which works on the basis of the use of the ambient temperature difference during the day - the temperature is high during the day, and the temperature decreases at nightAs a rule, this temperature difference is in the range of about 5-9 degrees, although there are regions in which this difference is much higher, for example, in winter in Urengoy it can reach up to 30 degrees. An energy converter of this type is considered in works/1-2/. The basis of the operation of such a converter is the change in the linear size of bodies, for example, plexiglass, with a change in temperature. When the temperature rises during the day, when the temperature is high, the rod lengthens, while at night, when the temperature is low, the linear dimensions of the rod decrease. This is exactly what is used to obtain energy through the use of a container. A conventional capacitor is used, one plate of which is fixed, the second plate of this capacitor is movable and connected to a dielectric plexiglass rod. When the temperature changes, for example, at a high temperature, the rod lengthens, the plates of the container come closer and the capacity will be maximum. At night, when the temperature decreases, the plexiglass rod is shortened, the plate moves away and the capacity decreases. If, at maximum capacity, the capacitor is charged and disconnected from the source, then the charge on it will be constant. At night, when the rod shrinks its linear dimensions, the movable plate moves away, the capacity falls. Since the charge on the container is constant, the voltage increases and we get an increase in energy, which is obtained from the day-night temperature difference and the change in the linear dimensions of the dielectric rod.

TI  - An integrated operational system to reduce O&M cost of offshore wind farms
AB  - Offshore wind is a relatively new industry and it is generally more expensive to generate electricity than many alternative renewable sources. Operation & Maintenance (O&M) makes up a significant part of the overall cost of running Offshore Wind Turbines (OWT). Since the O&M associated responsibility is shared among turbine manufacturers, wind farm operators and the offshore transmission owners, this has inevitably led to lack of information, duplication of effort and less efficiency. Big data analytics is one great technique that will drive future growth. In this paper, an integrated operational system of offshore wind farm is proposed deploying big data analytics. Firstly, the current state of the O&M of offshore wind farm and the big data analytics are introduced. Afterwards, a predictive maintenance model and a maintenance implementation model are proposed, and an integrated operational system is developed incorporating those two models in order to optimize maintenance planning and implementation. Finally, the possible contribution of such a system to a more effective O&M of offshore wind farm is discussed. Â© 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, London, UK.

TI  - Occurrence of Low-Level Jets over the Eastern US Coastal Zone at Heights Relevant to Wind Energy
AB  - Two years of high-resolution simulations conducted with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model are used to characterize the frequency, intensity and height of low-level jets (LLJ) over the U.S. Atlantic coastal zone. Meteorological conditions and the occurrence and characteristics of LLJs are described for (i) the centroids of thirteen of the sixteen active offshore wind energy lease areas off the U.S. east coast and (ii) along two transects extending east from the U.S. coastline across the northern lease areas (LA). Flow close to the nominal hub-height of wind turbines is predominantly northwesterly and southwesterly and exhibits pronounced seasonality, with highest wind speeds in November, and lowest wind speeds in June. LLJs diagnosed using vertical profiles of modeled wind speeds from approximately 20 to 530 m above sea level exhibit highest frequency in LA south of Massachusetts, where LLJs are identified in up to 12\% of hours in June. LLJs are considerably less frequent further south along the U.S. east coast and outside of the summer season. LLJs frequently occur at heights that intersect the wind turbine rotor plane, and at wind speeds within typical wind turbine operating ranges. LLJs are most frequent, intense and have lowest core heights under strong horizontal temperature gradients and lower planetary boundary layer heights.

TI  - Assessment of wave energy resources and their associated uncertainties for two coastal areas in Japan
AB  - At reconnaissance to feasibility study stages of wave energy development, guidelines and standards recommend wave power assessments to be conducted for long periods of time, albeit at relatively coarse spatial resolutions. However, quite often developers need to make a preliminary site selection based on high-resolution information. Unfortunately, even with abundant computational resources nowadays, running a high-resolution coastal model for more than a decade is still not practical. In this paper, we propose to combine uncertainty estimates from a 21-year-long 1-km-resolution model and a high-resolution (10Â m nearshore) coastal model to assess wave energy. Two sites in Japan facing the Pacific Ocean were selected for this study. One site located on the southern coast (site-S) is affected more by the passage of typhoons than another site located on the eastern coast (site-E). The estimated wave power climatology at site-S ranges between 3 and 7Â kWm-1 with an uncertainty of Â±Â 0.27 to Â±Â 0.51Â kWm-1; whereas for site-E, the climatology varies between 3 and 9Â kWm-1 with uncertainties of Â±Â 0.12 to Â±Â 0.34Â kWm-1. In general, the eastern coastal area of Japan is found to offer higher wave power and lower margins of uncertainty than compared with the southern coastal area.

TI  - Reconfigurable Control for Fault-Tolerant of Parallel Converters in PMSG Wind Energy Conversion System
AB  - Offshore wind energy conversion system (WECS) usually adopts parallel converters to expand power capacity and improve reliability because of limited power rating of power devices, harsh marine environment, and poor maintenance accessibility. Any faulty converter is cutoff under traditional fault-tolerant control. When all parallel converters are faulty, the wind turbine must be shut down. Although simple, such a fault-tolerant control reduces system availability. Thus, a reconfigurable control for fault-tolerant of parallel wind power converters is proposed in this paper. The current reference of every phase leg in parallel converter system is reconfigured postfault according to their healthy states. The proposed reconfigurable control is realized in software level and without requiring redundant hardware. Compared with traditional fault-tolerant control, the proposed reconfigurable control only cuts off the faulty legs rather than faulty converter, and makes full use of all healthy legs. The reconfigurable control improves the availability of parallel wind power converters and provides multiple-leg fault ride-through capability to WECS, enhancing reliability and electricity generation. The simulation and experimental results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed reconfigurable control.

TI  - Turning Scientific Knowledge into Regulation: Effective Measures for Noise Mitigation of Pile Driving
AB  - Pile driving is one of the most intense anthropogenic noise sources in the marine environment. Each foundation pile may require up to a several thousand strokes of high hammer energy to be driven to the embedded depth. Scientific evidence shows that effects on the marine environment have to be anticipated if mitigation measures are not applied. Effective mitigation measures to prevent and reduce the impact of pile driving noise should therefore be part of regulation. The role of regulators is to demonstrate and assess the applicability, efficiency and effectiveness of noise mitigation measures. This requires both, scientific knowledge on noise impacts and the consideration of normative aspects of noise mitigation. The establishment of mitigation procedures in plans and approvals granted by regulatory agencies includes several stages. Here, we outline a step-wise approach in which most of the actions described may be performed simultaneously. Potential measures include the appropriate maritime spatial planning to avoid conflicts with nature conservation, site development for offshore wind farms to avoid undesirable activities in time and space, coordination of activities to avoid cumulative effects, and the application of technical noise abatement systems to reduce noise at the source. To increase the acceptance of noise mitigation applications, technical measures should fulfil a number of requirements: (a) they are applicable and affordable, (b) they are state-of-the-art or at least advanced in development, (c) their efficiency can be assessed with standardised procedures. In this study, the efficiency of noise mitigation applied recently in offshore wind farm construction projects in the German North Sea is explained and discussed with regard to the regulation framework, including the technical abatement of impulsive pile driving noise.

TI  - Development of an ocean wave energy harvester with a built-in frequency conversion function
AB  - The research develops a novel harvester associated with a built-in frequency conversion device to harness energy from ocean waves based on the piezoelectric effect. The developed harvester consists of 2 generators driven by rotational motions converted from vertical motions by a rack and pinion actuator. The generator has a rotator with a magnetic bar attached to its blade tips and a stator. By this innovative design, the harvester is capable of converting ocean waves with low frequencies to mechanical vibrations with higher excitation frequencies of the piezoelectric transducer for increasing its energy conversion efficiency. A corresponding mathematical model for the harvester is developed to evaluate the generated power. The simulation results show that the generated power increases with increases in the ocean wave height, number of magnetic bars and decreases in the wave period, the distance between 2 opposite magnetic bars, and harvester's submerged part height. The power output is realized up to 260Â W with the height, length, and width of the harvester being 1m Ã— 1m Ã— 1m, at the ocean wave height and period being 2Â m and 7Â seconds, respectively.

TI  - Experimental and techno-economic feasibility analysis of renewable energy technologies for Jabel Ali Port in UAE
AB  - Due to the excessive amount of exhaust gas emitted by its activities, the seaport is considered to be one of the sources of the deterioration of the marine environment. In addition, most seaports rely on the National Grid as an energy source to meet domestic and ship power needs. However, nowadays, the maritime industry requires an environmentally-friendly operation of seaports. This paper presents a summary discussion of the concept of green ports and some of their aspects. It further offers a bird-eye view of some of their applications worldwide. Meanwhile, an initiative is made to attempt applying renewable energy power sources to a selected case-study; â€œPort of Jabel Aliâ€, to examine the feasibility of applying such aspects of the green port concept to this port. A prototype experiment is setup to assess the wind and solar potential in the region, aided with a simulation model using HOMERâ„¢ software, to verify the experimental results and to confirm the principle. Results show that the three selected cases show promising performances while applying the renewable energy application through the maritime port with the main grid. When the solar PV system is applied to the system, a total cost reduction of 10% is achieved as well as a 10.5% reduction in levelized cost of energy. When the wind farm system is applied, 20.8% cost reduction with corresponding 21% lower levelized cost of energy is achieved. Therefore, the wind farm and solar PV system achieve 28.7% cost reduction and 31.8% reduction of the levelized cost of energy. Â© 2021 The Author(s)

TI  - Structural Strength Analysis of Main Crane Pedestal of the Jack-up Wind Turbine Installation Vessel
AB  - The jack-up wind turbine installation vessel is a special kind of vessel for building the offshore wind power farm. The main crane pedestal, which is the supporting structure of the crane on the main deck of the vessel, is always under high level loads when the ship is in operation condition. In this paper, the structural strength analysis of main crane pedestal of the jack-up wind turbine installation vessel was presented. The direct calculated method was used to evaluate the strength of the main crane pedestal. The FE model of main crane pedestal was established with refined mesh, and the adjoining hull structure was also modeled to provide accurate boundary condition. Considering the permanent loads, variable loads (crane loads) and wind loads on the pedestal, the load combinations were defined for the ultimate limit state for every 45 degree. The deformation and stress of the pedestal and the hull structures were calculated and checked. The results showed that all stress results were within the maximum allowable stresses. The critical areas are often located at the link region of hull and pedestal.

TI  - Integration and optimization of alternative sources of energy in a remote region
AB  - In a remote coastal region supply of energy from national grid is insufficient for a sustainable development. Integration and optimization of local alternative renewable energy sources is an optional solution of the problem.

A bottom-up energy system optimization model is proposed in order to support planning policies for promoting the use of renewable energy sources. A software, based on multiple factors and constrains analysis for optimization energy flow is proposed, which provides detailed information for exploitation each source of energy, power and heat generation, GHG emissions and end-use sectors. Economical analysis shows that with existing technologies both stand alone and regional facilities may be feasible.

TI  - The energy future - Process control's role
AB  - The potentials of process control in wind, ocean wave, and geothermal energy systems in energy management is discussed. The US Department of Energy has estimated that the combine capacity of wind generators is expected to reach to 72 gW that corresponds to 2-7% of the national electricity generating capacity. Wind-turbine generated electricity is a cost competitive measure and exists in a range of 4-6 cents/kWh and the average electricity cost from the power companies is about 12 cents/kWh. The generating capacity of the average wind-turbine in the US is 2 kW to 10 kW and the federal government is considering supporting their use with one time credit of $3000/kW. Ocean wave energy is another renewable energy source and the power in the wave front varies between 30kW/m and 70kW/m. Geothermal energy is an exhaustible and renewable with the less production cost than that of fossil energy and geothermal heat pumps can be used to cool buildings in summer.

TI  - A Review-based Comparison of Drivetrain Options for Tidal Turbines
AB  - Tidal turbine technology is not as mature as wind turbine technology; in addition tidal turbines are submerged systems. Therefore, they have to withstand high loading and harsh submarine conditions. To make tidal energy competitive compared to the other renewable sources, many challenges need to be overcome. The drivetrain configuration choice is one of the most important challenges that should address the question: with or without a gearbox? This paper will therefore address this critical issue by describing a review-based comparison and discussing the magnetic gearbox option as a promising drivetrain topology.

TI  - Energy production from tidal currents in an estuary: A comparative study of floating and bottom-fixed turbines
AB  - In a tidal stream project the selection of the most appropriate device is of major importance. The aim of this work is to investigate the difference between two tidal farms, one with floating TSTs (Tidal Stream Turbines), the other with bottom-fixed TSTs, in terms of annual performance and its monthly variability. This investigation is carried out considering real operational conditions in a case study: Ria de Ortigueira (NW Spain), a drowned river valleys which is one of the most promising sites for tidal stream energy exploitation in the Iberian Peninsula. A 3D, high-resolution, numerical model is applied to simulate the hydrodynamics of the ria during an entire year with either the floating or bottom-fixed TSTs, and, on these grounds, determine the most representative performance parameters. Significant differences emerge in the performance of both plants; these are due to a great extent to the vertical variation in the flow velocity, which is relevant at many sites of interest for tidal stream energy exploitation such as Ria de Ortigueira. Finally, relevant variations were identified in the intra-annual performance which must be borne in mind in dimensioning the plant. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A crashworthy device against ship-OWT collision and its protection effects on the tower of offshore wind farms
AB  - At present, more and more offshore wind farms have been built and numerous projects are on the drawing tables. Therefore, the study on the safety of collision between ships and offshore wind turbines (OWT) is of great practical significance. The present study takes the advantage of the famous LS-DYNA explicit code to simulate the dynamic process of the collision between a typical 3MW offshore wind turbine model with monopile foundation and a simplified 2000t-class ship model. In the simulation, the added mass effect of the ship, contact nonlinearity of collision, material nonlinearity of steel and aluminum foam and adaptive mesh technique for large structure deformation have been taken into consideration. Proposed is a crashworthy device for OWT of new conceptual steel sphere shell-circular ring aluminum foam pad, and the good performance of the device under the conditions of ship-OWT front impact and side impact has been verified from the views of theoretical analysis and numerical results. The new crashworthy device can effectively smooth the contact force and reduce the top structure dynamic response, using its own structure plastic deformation to absorb most of the ship collision energy. As a result, the main structure of the OWT and the inside key electric control equipments can be saved by scarifying the structural plastic deformation of new sphere crashworthy device. What is more, the sphere configuration design of the crashworthy device can effectively guide the ship to run away from the main OWT structure and reduce the damage of the ship and OWT to some degree during side impact.

The document will provide guidance to MRE designers and analysts, providing confidence as to reliability and insurability. All papers in the MRE session address specific civil engineering aspects of MRE projects. The papers cover multiple engineering disciplines required for relatively new MRE technologies that are arriving into the well-established and documented ocean environment. Some papers naturally touch on the electrical and mechanical issues involved with specific MRE device technology. The guide document that has evolved includes chapters developed by experienced engineers, generally working in sub-committees, including sections addressing: Environmental Loads, Geotechnics, Government Issues, Moorings, In-Stream Hydrokinetics (ocean, riverine, and tidal currents) Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion, Risk and Reliability, Submarine Cables, and Wave Energy Converters. In most areas the guide points towards existing well-established codes including API, ISO and Classification Societies, as well as newer evolving international codes such as those being developed by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Several MRE committee members also sit on the IEC Technical Committee (TC) 114 US Technical Advisory Group (TAG) and improve liaison between IEC and ASCE COPRI. In some areas, particularly geotechnics, the guide provides information not found in existing codes. Engineers who read the guide will gain a basic knowledge of a wide range of MRE devices, as well as an understanding of how to deal with the civil engineering aspects of their design and analysis. This information is difficult to find in a technical and comprehensive form elsewhere. This paper presents an insight as to what will be in the ASCE COPRI MRE guide.

TI  - Innovative power generators for energy harvesting using electroactive polymer artificial muscles
AB  - The type of electroactive polymer known as dielectric elastomers has shown considerable promise for a variety of actuator applications and may be well suited for harvesting energy from environmental sources such as ocean waves or water currents. The high energy density and conversion efficiency of dielectric elastomers can allow for very simple and robust "direct drive" generators. Preliminary energy harvesting generators based on dielectric elastomers have been tested. A generator attached to a rotating waterwheel via a crankshaft produced 35 mJ per revolution in a laboratory test with an actual water flow. A generator that harvests the energy of ocean waves for purposes of supplying power to ocean buoys (such as navigation buoys) was tested at sea for two weeks. This buoy-mounted generator uses a proof-mass to provide the mechanical forces that stretch and contract the dielectric elastomer generator. The generator operated successfully during the sea trials. Wave conditions were very small during this test. Although the device did not produce large amounts of power, it did produce net power output with waves as small as 10 cm peak-to-peak wave height. Both the waterwheel and buoy-mounted generators will be scaled up to produce larger amounts of power. The use of significantly larger amounts of dielectric elastomer material to produce generator modules with outputs in the kilowatt range is being investigated for application to ocean wave power systems.

TI  - Power Output Prediction of Wave Farms Using Fully Connected Networks
AB  - One of the most important factors in the amount of power generated by a wave farm is the Wave Energy Converters (WECs) arrangement along with the usual wave conditions. Therefore, forming an appropriate arrangement of WECs in an array is a significant parameter in maximizing power absorption. This paper focuses on developing a fully connected neural model in order to predict the total power output of a wave farm based on the placement of the converters, derived from the four real wave scenarios on the southern coast of Australia. The applied converter model is a fully submerged three-tether converter called CETO. Data collected from the test sites is used to design a neural model for predicting the wave farm's power output produced. A precise analysis of the WEC placement is investigated to reveal the amount of power generated by the wave farms on the test site. We finally proposed a suitable configuration of a fully connected neural model to forecast the power output with high accuracy.

TI  - Use of an INLA Latent Gaussian Modeling Approach to Assess Bird Population Changes Due to the Development of Offshore Wind Farms
AB  - The utilization of marine renewable energies such as offshore wind farming leads to globally expanding human activities in marine habitats. While knowledge on the responses to offshore wind farms and associated shipping traffic is accumulating now at a fast pace, it becomes important to assess the population impacts on species affected by those activities. In the North Sea, the protected diver species Red-throated Diver (Gavia stellata) and Black-throated Diver (Gavia arctica) widely avoid offshore wind farms. We used an explicit spatio-temporal Bayesian model to get a robust estimate of the diver population during the spring season between 2001 and 2018, based on a set of aerial surveys from long-term monitoring programs within the German North Sea. Despite the erection of 20 offshore wind farms in the study area and marked responses of divers to wind farms, model results indicated that there was no population decline, and overall numbers fluctuated around 16,600 individuals, with average annual 95% CI ranging between 13,400 and 21,360 individuals. Although, avoidance behavior due to wind farm development led to a more narrowly focused spatial distribution of the birds centered in the persistent high concentration zone in the Eastern German Bight Special Protection Area, the results provide no indication of negative fitness consequences on these long-lived species. However, more research is needed on habitat use and food availability in this regard.

TI  - Effect of motion reduction structures on motion of floating wave energy converter
AB  - The goal of this study was to optimize the design of motion reduction structures for a floating pendulum-type wave energy converter (WEC) used to harness energy from the ocean. The purpose of these structures was to improve the performance of the WEC by reducing its motion under operating wave conditions and by helping the device absorb wave energy efficiently. Moreover, the motion reduction structures cause wave motion that protects the WEC against direct excitation of wave loads under extreme wave conditions. In this study, motion reduction structures were installed on a floating pendulum WEC that has been the subject of previous studies. The effects of the structures were then analyzed under different incident wave conditions. The design parameters for the motion reduction structures were size, shape, and installed position. The wave-induced motion characteristics and performance of the floating pendulum WEC were investigated numerically. Based on the simulation results, we were able to optimize the motion reduction structure design of the WEC, thus improving its efficiency and durability.

TI  - Consideration of scales in offshore wind environmental impact assessments
AB  - Quality of environmental impact assessments (EIAs) has been criticized, in part due to a lack of accounting in these tools for differing spatial and temporal scales inherent in ecological data. In the United States, leases of outer continental shelf blocks for offshore wind projects and their construction and operation plans require EIAs in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the 1978 Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act. This study evaluated consideration of spatiotemporal scales of stressors, receptors (specifically cetaceans), and effects in eight federal offshore wind energy EIAs against 26 criteria extracted from federal regulations. The criteria analysis determined that EIAs do not consistently or comprehensively address spatiotemporal scales with respect to federal requirements. Deficiencies in addressing spatiotemporal scales may result from imprecise regulations, intent to simplify encyclopedic documents, or lack of data resulting in incomplete assessments, inappropriate mitigation actions, and projects delays. Recommendations to improve compliance with federal regulations include making federal guidance binding, focusing on non-trivial impacts of species, tiering information, and incorporating outcomes of marine spatial planning.

TI  - Impact of Tidal Energy on Battery Sizing in Standalone Microgrids: A Case Study
AB  - This paper investigates the impact of adding tidal energy on the size of battery energy storage (BES) required to absorb power fluctuations present in a standalone microgrid with wind, solar and diesel engine is driven generation sources. The Flinders Island power system is chosen as the standalone microgrid for the case study. In addition to the battery capacity, emissions and operational costs are also taken as the variables that should be minimized in optimization problem formulated in this study. In order to solve this multi-objective optimization problem an intelligent expert fuzzy system-grey Wolf optimization (FL-GWO) algorithm is proposed in this paper. Different scenarios based on the weather conditions in the Flinders Island is considered to demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed (FL-GWO) method. The numerical results show that when tidal energy is introduced the required battery capacity dropped from 300kWh to 250kWh which is equivalent to 16.67% drop. The effectiveness of the FL-GWO is validated by comparing it with other existing approaches such as the rules-based method and conventional GWO algorithm. Â© 2018 IEEE.

TI  - Assessing larval connectivity for marine spatial planning in the Adriatic
AB  - There are plans to start building offshore marine renewable energy devices throughout the Mediterranean and the Adriatic has been identified as a key location for wind farm developments. The development of offshore wind farms in the area would provide hard substrata for the settlement of sessile benthos. Since the seafloor of the Adriatic is predominantly sedimentary this may alter the larval connectivity of benthic populations in the region. Here, we simulated the release of larvae from benthic populations along the coasts of the Adriatic Sea using coupled bio-physical models and investigated the effect of pelagic larval duration on dispersal. Our model simulations show that currents typically carry particles from east to west across the Adriatic, whereas particles released along western coasts tend to remain there with the Puglia coast of Italy acting as a sink for larvae from benthic populations. We identify areas of high connectivity, as well as areas that are much more isolated, and discuss how these results can be used to inform marine spatial planning and the licensing of offshore marine renewable energy developments.

TI  - PMSM Wind Farm Aggregation Algorithm Based on Power Equivalence Principle
AB  - With the continuing increase of offshore wind farm power scale, it is urgent to propose a simplified wind farm model, which aggregates the entire wind farm into single or several aggregated wind turbine generators (WTGs), aiming to save computing resources and improve simulation speed. A novel aggregation algorithm that considers the power loss of offshore submarine cable is proposed, which is different from the traditional wind farm modeling method that adopts amplifying transformer as aggregation medium. Moreover, multi machine aggregation (MMA) algorithm is furtherly proposed to improve the aggregation accuracy. Simulation results verify that the proposed aggregation method can present the dynamic characteristics of wind farm with high accuracy, and can be popularized for other types of wind farm.

TI  - Analysis of characteristics of Dynamic Tidal Power on the west coast of Korea
AB  - Korea has developed various new and renewable energy resources since 2000 due to increasing demand for Green Energy around the world. Because the west coast of Korea has an extreme tidal range, many research projects aimed at harnessing tidal energy have been conducted there successfully. Though the study of Dynamic Tidal Power (DTP) was started as a new tidal energy source about 20 years ago, its characteristics are not yet fully understood. DTP has the potential to have less environmental impact than does a conventional barrage type tidal power generator. Its characteristics were analyzed in many test cases using a numerical model. The theoretical maximum tidal power of DTP became the same as the maximum tidal range by controlling the phase difference. This showed that DTP has great potential for a very successful future in the Yellow Sea. Moreover, DTP could provide an attractive energy source even in areas of lower tidal range than indicated in previous studies. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Computational design and optimization of wind farms using analytical derivatives
AB  - This paper presents a multidisciplinary framework for computational design and optimization of coupled offshore wind farm layout and support structure using analytical derivatives. Gradient-based optimization with exact analytical derivatives scales well with large design problems, and it is the preferred approach over gradient-free techniques. We used the second order Larsen model to simulate the wake in the wind farm. Combined with an energy production model and Weibull wind distribution function, the annual energy production of the wind farm is computed. Timoshenko beam elements model the support structure including the soil-structure interaction. Airyâ€™s wave theory with Wheeler stretching is utilized for modeling the wave kinematics and to obtain the hydrodynamic loads using Morisonâ€™s equation. Cost models are used to evaluate the levelized cost of energy as the objective function. The design constraints are the support structure buckling, modal-frequency, and stresses. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we performed an optimization of a feasible baseline design consisting of 6 Vestas V80 wind turbines. Compared to the baseline design, our results show that the coupled layout and support structure approach reduces the levelized cost of energy by 1.4%. This efficient computational framework allows the concurrent design of the wind farm layout and support structure with thousands design variables, and it suitable for detailed design of offshore wind farms.
