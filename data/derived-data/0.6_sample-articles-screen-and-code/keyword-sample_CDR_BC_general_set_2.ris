TI  - Potential use of engineered nanoparticles in ocean fertilization for large-scale atmospheric carbon dioxide removal
AB  - This Analysis considers the potential benefits and challenges of applying engineered nanoparticles for artificial-ocean-fertilization-driven carbon sequestration Artificial ocean fertilization (AOF) aims to safely stimulate phytoplankton growth in the ocean and enhance carbon sequestration. AOF carbon sequestration efficiency appears lower than natural ocean fertilization processes due mainly to the low bioavailability of added nutrients, along with low export rates of AOF-produced biomass to the deep ocean. Here we explore the potential application of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) to overcome these issues. Data from 123 studies show that some ENPs may enhance phytoplankton growth at concentrations below those likely to be toxic in marine ecosystems. ENPs may also increase bloom lifetime, boost phytoplankton aggregation and carbon export, and address secondary limiting factors in AOF. Life-cycle assessment and cost analyses suggest that net CO2 capture is possible for iron, SiO2 and Al2O3 ENPs with costs of 2-5 times that of conventional AOF, whereas boosting AOF efficiency by ENPs should substantially enhance net CO2 capture and reduce these costs. Therefore, ENP-based AOF can be an important component of the mitigation strategy to limit global warming.

TI  - Global forest products markets and forest sector carbon impacts of projected sea level rise
AB  - Sea level rise (SLR) is among the climate-change-related problems of greatest concern, threatening the lives and property of coastal residents and generating far-reaching economic and ecological impacts. We project that SLR will lead to an increase in the rate of new housing construction to replace destroyed structures, impact global wood products supply and demand conditions, and cause changes in global forest sector carbon mitigation potential. Findings indicate that 71 million new units will be built by 2050 to accommodate the SLR-affected global population. More than two-thirds of these new units are projected to be in Asia. The estimated extra wood products needed to build these new residential units is 1,659 million m3, assuming that all these structures would be built mainly with wood, representing a 4 % increase in total wood consumption, compared to projected reference level global wood products consumption. Increased timber removals to meet this higher construction wood demand (alternative scenario) is shown to deplete global forest carbon by 2 % by 2050 compared to the reference scenario. However, all such projected declines in forest biomass carbon could be more than offset by increased carbon sequestration in harvested wood products, avoided emissions due to substitution of wood for non-wood materials in construction, and biomass regrowth on forestland by 2050, with an estimated net emissions reduction benefit of 0.47 tCO2e/tCO2e of extra wood used in SLR-related new houses over 30 years. The global net emissions reduction benefit increased to 2.13 tCO2e/tCO2e of extra wood when price-induced changes in forest land area were included. Â© 2022

TI  - Evaluation of carbon sequestrations in Japan with a mathematical model
AB  - Cost effectiveness Of CO2 sequestration, especially into aquifers, strongly depends on the sequestration capacities and the routes connecting their sites and CO2 recovery sites. This site dependency Of CO2 sequestration makes their evaluations difficult. In order to evaluate C 02 sequestration in parallel with other carbon mitigation options in Japan, a new model has been developed for this study. Explicit modeling is made for energy systems and also CO2 recoveries from fossil fuel power plants, CO2 transportation and sequestration processes. To pay due consideration to the site dependency, the land area of Japan is divided into 20 regions and the off-shore area also into 20 regions. The land regions have various types of electric power plants and other energy systems. On the other hand, the off-shore regions have aquifers for CO2 sequestration. In addition, CO2 sequestration into the ocean is taken into account. These model regions are inter-linked to each other to evaluate CO2 transportation between the CO2 sources and the reservoirs. The total costs of energy systems and CO2 sequestration in Japan between the year of 2000 and 2050 is minimized in this model. This paper describes the structure of this new model for evaluation Of CO2 sequestrations in Japan, and presents optimized solutions as to when, where and how much CO2 sequestration and other carbon mitigation options should be implemented under assumed carbon mitigation policy options using this new model.

TI  - Gas recovery through the injection of carbon dioxide or concentrated flue gas in a natural gas hydrate reservoir
AB  - Because CO2 hydrate is stable at pressures lower than those required to stabilize hydrates of CH4 when compared at the same temperature the injection of CO2 into gas hydrate reservoirs was proposed a while ago as a method to recover methane. The added advantage of such a technology is the simultaneous sequestering/storage of CO2 captured from fossil fuel power plants or other significant point sources of CO2. Recent reviews on the subject have provided an account of the laboratory and theoretical work on this topic. The reviews highlighted the need to further elucidate the dynamics of the exchange process and provide information needed for the design of industrial scale facilities. In this work, the kinetics of the CO2/CH4 exchange process are investigated in a 5.3 L laboratory crystallizer (reservoir) equipped with ahorizontal injection tube with 24 exits into the packed bed of silica sand particles. Preliminary experiments conducted using this apparatus and also with a high pressure calorimeter indicate that in lab experiments there is some residual water and that the extent of the exchange process is limited. Even if the CH4 recovery is optimized there is aneed for a CH4/CO2 separation plant to enable a complete cyclic sequence of CO2 capture, injection and CH4 recovery.

TI  - The role of nutricline depth in regulating the ocean carbon cycle
AB  - Carbon uptake by marine phytoplankton, and its export as organic matter to the ocean interior (i.e., the "biological pump"), lowers the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) in the upper ocean and facilitates the diffusive drawdown of atmospheric CO2. Conversely, precipitation of calcium carbonate by marine planktonic calcifiers such as coccolithophorids increases pCO2 and promotes its outgassing (i.e., the "alkalinity pump"). Over the past â‰ˆ100 million years, these two carbon fluxes have been modulated by the relative abundance of diatoms and coccolithophores, resulting in biological feedback on atmospheric CO2 and Earth's climate; yet, the processes determining the relative distribution of these two phytoplankton taxa remain poorly understood. We analyzed phytoplankton community composition in the Atlantic Ocean and show that the distribution of diatoms and coccolithophorids is correlated with the nutricline depth, a proxy of nutrient supply to the upper mixed layer of the ocean. Using this analysis in conjunction with a coupled atmosphere-ocean intermediate complexity model, we predict a dramatic reduction in the nutrient supply to the euphotic layer in the coming century as a result of increased thermal stratification. Our findings indicate that, by altering phytoplankton community composition, this causal relationship may lead to a decreased efficiency of the biological pump in sequestering atmospheric CO2, implying a positive feedback in the climate system. These results provide a mechanistic basis for understanding the connection between upper ocean dynamics, the calcium carbonate-to-organic C production ratio and atmospheric pCO2 variations on time scales ranging from seasonal cycles to geological transitions.

TI  - Stability of liquid CO2 in seawater at high pressures
AB  - The stability of liquid CO2, in seawater at 3Â°C under high pressures were investigated by observing the pH and temperature changes around liquid CO2 as well as its state. There was no distinct change of the state of liquid CO2 at 37 MPa, while the liquid CO2 at 32 MPa was unstable. Our experimental investigations suggest that a huge amount of liquid CO2 can be sequestered for a very long time with reducing CO2 dissolution and its impacts on ecosystems, if we dispose liquid CO2 at the depth greater than 3700 m in an ocean.

TI  - Spring bloom community change modifies carbon pathways and C: N: P : Chl a stoichiometry of coastal material fluxes
AB  - Diatoms and dinoflagellates are major bloomforming phytoplankton groups competing for resources in the oceans and coastal seas. Recent evidence suggests that their competition is significantly affected by climatic factors under ongoing change, modifying especially the conditions for cold-water, spring bloom communities in temperate and Arctic regions. We investigated the effects of phytoplankton community composition on spring bloom carbon flows and nutrient stoichiometry in multiyear mesocosm experiments. Comparison of differing communities showed that community structure significantly affected C accumulation parameters, with highest particulate organic carbon (POC) buildup and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release in diatom-dominated communities. In terms of inorganic nutrient drawdown and bloom accumulation phase, the dominating groups behaved as functional surrogates. Dominance patterns, however, significantly affected C : N: P : Chl a ratios over the whole bloom event: when diatoms were dominant, these ratios increased compared to dinoflagellate dominance or mixed communities. Diatom-dominated communities sequestered carbon up to 3.6-fold higher than the expectation based on the Redfield ratio, and 2-fold higher compared to dinoflagellate dominance. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental report of consequences of climatically driven shifts in phytoplankton dominance patterns for carbon sequestration and related biogeochemical cycles in coastal seas. Our results also highlight the need for remote sensing technologies with taxonomical resolution, as the C : Chl a ratio was strongly dependent on community composition and bloom stage. Climate-driven changes in phytoplankton dominance patterns will have far-reaching consequences for major biogeochemical cycles and need to be considered in climate change scenarios for marine systems.

TI  - A preliminary assessment of carbon storage suitability in deep underground geological formations of New Brunswick, Canada
AB  - An assessment of the surface and subsurface geology in New Brunswick has identified several regions, close to Large Final Emitters (industrial sites releasing carbon dioxide, CO2, into the atmosphere), underlain by large volumes of various sedimentary rocks that could act as either the reservoir or seal in a carbon storage operation. There is a lack of subsurface data with which to make an assessment for the New Brunswick Platform, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and Northumberland Strait. In the Moncton Basin, the McCully Gas Field is hosted in tight gas sands where it would be difficult to pump down CO2 at an economical rate. The Stoney Creek Oil and Gas Field south of Moncton is not at sufficient depth for CO2 to be in a supercritical state, necessary for compressed storage. Saline reservoirs could underlie suitably large areas around these fields, but again there is limited information on the quality of the potential reservoir rock. In the Bay of Fundy, south of Saint John, one borehole indicates a prospective location that includes a saline reservoir with suitable thickness and wireline-calculated porosity and permeability, a seal with suitable thickness, and limited faulting to potentially compartmentalize the reservoir or, conversely, compromise the continuity of the seal. The major uncertainty is trap volume, which is particularly difficult to assess based on the borehole being the only data point within a 50 km radius. This is also an environmentally sensitive offshore area. Until data deficiencies are addressed, no locations can be recommended for carbon storage. Â© Atlantic Geology, 2015.

TI  - Ecosystem function after the K/Pg extinction: decoupling of marine carbon pump and diversity
AB  - The ocean biological pump is the mechanism by which carbon and nutrients are transported to depth. As such, the biological pump is critical in the partitioning of carbon dioxide between the ocean and atmosphere, and the rate at which that carbon can be sequestered through burial in marine sediments. How the structure and function of planktic ecosystems in the ocean govern the strength and efficiency of the biological pump and its resilience to disruption are poorly understood. The aftermath of the impact at the Cretaceous/Palaeogene (K/Pg) boundary provides an ideal opportunity to address these questions as both the biological pump and marine plankton size and diversity were fundamentally disrupted. The excellent fossil record of planktic foraminifera as indicators of pelagic-biotic recovery combined with carbon isotope records tracing biological pump behaviour, show that the recovery of ecological traits (diversity, size and photosymbiosis) occurred much later (approx. 4.3 Ma) than biological pump recovery (approx. 1.8 Ma). We interpret this decoupling of diversity and the biological pump as an indication that ecosystem function had sufficiently recovered to drive an effective biological pump, at least regionally in the South Atlantic.

TI  - Criteria and workflow for selecting depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs for carbon storage
AB  - Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is playing a role in mitigating carbon emissions and that role is expected to grow dramatically with time. Clustering CO2 sources and sinks through hubs is one way to achieve large-scale deployment of CCS and widespread decarbonization of the energy sector. A key element to the success of hub projects is finding a suitable sequestration site to store these combined emissions. In this study, a quantitative, criteria-driven methodology was developed to assess the potential suitability of depleted oil and gas reservoirs for carbon storage. The methodology utilizes a three-stage process that screens, ranks, and characterizes potential sites based on three categories: (1) capacity and injectivity optimization, (2) retention and geomechanical risk minimization, and (3) siting and economic constraints. Many potential sites are assessable using this methodology until an optimal depleted reservoir, or geographically adjacent set of reservoirs, is identified. The framework is designed to provide insights into the suitability of depleted reservoirs in a variety of different geological environments as well as to be adaptable to a project's specifications. Specifically, the criteria-driven workflow was applied to fields in the Gulf of Mexico and screened 1,317 fields to identify 10 clusters of 31 fields for further assessment and then ranked those fields and clusters to identify the most suitable sites for secure storage.

TI  - Allometric models for aboveground biomass estimation of the mangrove Avicennia schaueriana
AB  - As mangroves become recognized as important carbon storages, the need for reducing the uncertainty of carbon inventories becomes increasingly emphasized. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to develop allometric models to estimate the total aboveground biomass (AGB) and the biomass per compartment of Avicennia schaueriana and to compare them with other models previously published for the genus Avicennia. Fifty three A. schaueriana trees, with different diameters at breast height (DBH) and height, were felled in a mangrove from Southeastern Brazil and their dry weight determined. Simple linear regression analysis was used to develop the equations after log-transformation, using the following independent variables: DBH and DBH2 * height. All the equations were significant and presented high R a 2 (adjusted coefficient of determination). DBH provided the lowest SEE (standard error of estimation) in the regressions associated to leaves and total AGB, while DBH2 * height generated the most precise regressions for trunk, branches, and twigs. In comparison with other 11 equations previously developed for the genus Avicennia, the equation developed in the present study for total AGB showed the lowest mean deviation in relation to trees with known biomass, underscoring the importance of developing species- and site-specific equations.

TI  - CO2 capture, transport, sequestration and storage technologies: Implications for sustainable energy use [TecnologÃ­as de captura, transporte, secuestro y almacenamiento de CO2: implicaciones para el uso sostenible de la energÃ­a]
AB  - As the increase in energy needs accompanies the growth of the world population, the concern about pollution, global warming, and fires becomes greater. This concern stimulates investments and research not in the field of sustainable development, with the generation of carbon dioxide being one of the biggest problems in the energy sector, with the burning of fossil fuels and its strong impact on global warming. Carbon dioxide is a gas that participates in the effect of the stove and contributes to the rise in global temperature, the acceleration in sea levels, and the reduction of glaciers. To reduce CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, technologies are being used to capture, transport, sequester and store carbon dioxide. This work seeks to review two types of technologies, analyze their applicability and clarify the main concepts. Â© 2022 Universidad Industrial de Santander. All rights reserved.

TI  - Overview of the Midwest Geologic Sequestration Consortium pilot projects
AB  - As part of the US DOE's Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership program, the Midwest Geologic Sequestration Consortium has four active field demonstrations: two EOR pilots, one S/ECBM pilot, and one brine-saturated formation CO2 injection pilot. The S/ECBM pilot injection period was seven months which ended in mid-January 2009. The pilot included four wells completed in a coal seam at 900 ft. The injection well and three monitoring wells are oriented in the face and butt cleat directions. About 100 tons of CO2 were injected at 0.50-0.75 tons/day. Results indicate the enhancement of methane gas production and sequestration of CO2 through competitive desorption. Presently, post-CO2 water injection pressure transient tests are being completed to identify changes in cleat permeability resulting from CO2 adsorption. An immiscible (gas) CO2 EOR flood was started in May 2009 in a sandstone at 1900 ft. The injection rate was 20-25 tons/day. A water injection well was converted to a CO2 injection well. The well is centrally located between eight oil producing wells. CO2 injection ended in May 2010 with cumulative injection of about 7,200 tons. Twelve months of water injection are planned after CO2 injection. Several 100 barrels of incremental oil recovery have been measured; less than 5% of the injected CO2 has been produced. A liquid CO2 EOR, inverted 5-spot pilot was started in September 2009 and injection continued through January 2010 until winter road restrictions were enforced. During this time 2,860 tons were injected at 25-30 tons/day. While road travel was restricted, 13,000 barrels of water were injected. CO2 injection resumed in May 2010 and is planned to continue through the summer. At the end of the first CO2 injection period, the pattern's oil production rate increased 200% from its baseline. The injection well of the deep saline formation test was drilled and completed in 2009. A verification well is scheduled to be drilled later in 2010. Injection is planned for 2011. The UIC permit process is near completion. This one million ton injection project will be in the Mt. Simon sandstone, the deepest sedimentary formation in the Illinois Basin. Injection rates of 1,100 tons/day are anticipated. Copyright 2010, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - Enabling Large-Scale Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS) Using Offshore Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Infrastructure DevelopmentsA Review
AB  - Presently, the only offshore project for enhanced oil recovery using carbon dioxide, known as CO2-EOR, is in Brazil. Several desk studies have been undertaken, without any projects being implemented. The objective of this review is to investigate barriers to the implementation of large-scale offshore CO2-EOR projects, to identify recent technology developments, and to suggest non-technological incentives that may enable implementation. We examine differences between onshore and offshore CO2-EOR, emerging technologies that could enable projects, as well as approaches and regulatory requirements that may help overcome barriers. Our review shows that there are few, if any, technical barriers to offshore CO2-EOR. However, there are many other barriers to the implementation of offshore CO2-EOR, including: High investment and operation costs, uncertainties about reservoir performance, limited access of CO2 supply, lack of business models, and uncertainties about regulations. This review describes recent technology developments that may remove such barriers and concludes with recommendations for overcoming non-technical barriers. The review is based on a report by the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum (CSLF).

TI  - Depth, radiocarbon, and the effectiveness of direct CO2 injection as an ocean carbon sequestration strategy
AB  - [}1] If radiocarbon were a good predictor of the amount of time until a water parcel returns to the surface, it could be used to estimate the effectiveness of carbon sequestration by direct injection. We performed direct CO2 injection simulations in both one-dimensional box-diffusion and three-dimensional ocean general circulation models. The 1-D model results for ocean carbon retention accord with the 3-D model results, especially in the Pacific basin and at shallower depths. In the 1-D model, carbon retention in the ocean is directly related to both the injection depth and the Delta(14)C of carbon at the injection location. However, in the 3-D model, depth, but not radiocarbon, provides a relatively good prediction of carbon retention. This suggests that the expected time for a water parcel to return to the surface is closely related to its depth and not in general to the time since last at the surface.

TI  - Formation of mixed gas hydrates: A thermodynamic study
AB  - Naturally occurring clathrate hydrates can be found in coastal sediments or the permafrost, and their exploration constitutes an attractive future source of energy. Industrially, clathrate hydrates offer promising means for safe storage and transport of large volumes of gas, e.g., hydrogen or methane gas. Additionally, utilization of gas hydrates for ocean carbon sequestration as a means to control build-up of greenhouse gases is a field of active research. The formation of gas hydrates from two gaseous mixtures of CO2/N2 and CH4/C3H* is presented.

TI  - Carbon-neutral jet-fuel re-synthesised from sequestrated CO2
AB  - A chemical pathway combining reverse water gas shift, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and hydro-cracking was considered to re-synthesise jet fuel from CO2 captured at high purity by oxy-fuelling of a typical coal-fired power station (Drax, UK). The oxygen for oxy-fuelling and hydrogen for the fuel re-synthesis process are sourced by electrolysis of water. According to material and energy balances, 3.1 MT/year of jet fuel and 1.6 MT/year each of gas oil and naphtha can be produced from the Drax annual emissions of 20 MT of CO2, sufficient to supply 23% of the UK jet fuel requirements. The overall re-synthesis requires 16.9 GW, to be sourced renewably from (offshore) wind power, and releases 4.4 GW of exothermic energy giving scope for improvements via process integration. The energy re-synthesis penalty was 82% ideally and 95% on a practical basis. With the cost of offshore wind power predicted to reduce to 2.0 p/kWh by 2020, this 're-syn' jet fuel would be competitive with conventional jet fuel, especially if carbon taxes apply. The re-use of CO2 sequestrated from coal power stations to form jet-fuel would halve the combined CO2 emissions from the coal power and aviation sectors. Â© 2008 Taylor &amp; Francis.

TI  - Which option best estimates the above-ground biomass of mangroves of Bangladesh: pantropical or site- and species-specific models?
AB  - Bangladesh has the single largest tract of naturally growing mangrove forest as well as the world's largest manmade mangrove forest on newly accreted land in coastal areas. These mangrove forests provide significant support to the community as sources of renewable resources, shelter from natural calamities, and carbon sinks. The second nationwide forest inventory is now underway in Bangladesh. Biomass and carbon stock assessment of trees and forests is one of the objectives of this inventory. The present study aims to derive multi-species allometric biomass models for the Sundarbans mangrove forests and species-specific allometric biomass models for planted Sonneratia apetala Buch. Ham in the coastal zone of Bangladesh. A total of 342 individuals from 14 tree species from the Sundarbans and 73 individuals of planted S. apetala from the coastal zone were selected for the development and validation of the allometric model. A semi-destructive method was adopted to estimate the biomass of the sample trees. The best fit multi-species allometric model of Total Above-ground Biomass (TAGB) for the Sundarbans zone was Ln (TAGB) = - 6.7189 + 2.1634 {*} Ln(D) + 0.3752 {*} Ln(H) + 0.6895 {*} Ln(W). Moreover, relatively simple models with only DBH or DBH and H as predictive variables are also recommended for the Sundarbans zone. The best fit species-specific allometric model of TAGB for the planted S. apetala was Ln (TAGB) = - 1.7608 + 2.0077 {*} Ln(D) + 0.2981 {*} Ln(H), where D = diameter at breast height in cm, H = total height in m, and W = wood density (kg m(-3)). The derived best fit allometric models of TAGB for the Sundarbans and planted S. apetala were more efficient in biomass estimation than the frequently used regional and pan-tropical allometric models.

TI  - Monitoring Offshore CO2 Sequestration Using Marine CSEM Methods; Constraints Inferred from Field- and Laboratory-Based Gas Hydrate Studies
AB  - Offshore geological sequestration of CO2 offers a viable approach for reducing greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. Strategies include injection of CO2 into the deep-ocean or ocean-floor sediments, whereby depending on pressureâ€“temperature conditions, CO2 can be trapped physically, gravitationally, or converted to CO2 hydrate. Energy-driven research continues to also advance CO2-for-CH4 replacement strategies in the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ), producing methane for natural gas needs while sequestering CO2. In all cases, safe storage of CO2 requires reliable monitoring of the targeted CO2 injection sites and the integrity of the repository over time, including possible leakage. Electromagnetic technologies used for oil and gas exploration, sensitive to electrical conductivity, have long been considered an optimal monitoring method, as CO2, similar to hydrocarbons, typically exhibits lower conductivity than the surrounding medium. We apply 3D controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) forward modeling code to simulate an evolving CO2 reservoir in deep-ocean sediments, demonstrating sufficient sensitivity and resolution of CSEM data to detect reservoir changes even before sophisticated inversion of data. Laboratory measurements place further constraints on evaluating certain systems within the GHSZ; notably, CO2 hydrate is measurably weaker than methane hydrate, and &gt;1 order of magnitude more conductive, properties that may affect site selection, stability, and modeling considerations.

TI  - Southern Ocean carbon sink enhanced by sea-ice feedbacks at the Antarctic Cold Reversal
AB  - Increased Southern Ocean productivity driven by sea-ice feedbacks contributed to a slowdown in rising CO(2)levels during the last deglaciation, according to analyses of marine-derived aerosols from an Antarctic ice core. The Southern Ocean occupies 14\% of the Earth's surface and plays a fundamental role in the global carbon cycle and climate. It provides a direct connection to the deep ocean carbon reservoir through biogeochemical processes that include surface primary productivity, remineralization at depth and the upwelling of carbon-rich water masses. However, the role of these different processes in modulating past and future air-sea carbon flux remains poorly understood. A key period in this regard is the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR, 14.6-12.7 kyrbp), when mid- to high-latitude Southern Hemisphere cooling coincided with a sustained plateau in the global deglacial increase in atmospheric CO2. Here we reconstruct high-latitude Southern Ocean surface productivity from marine-derived aerosols captured in a highly resolved horizontal ice core. Our multiproxy reconstruction reveals a sustained signal of enhanced marine productivity across the ACR. Transient climate modelling indicates this period coincided with maximum seasonal variability in sea-ice extent, implying that sea-ice biological feedbacks enhanced CO(2)sequestration and created a substantial regional marine carbon sink, which contributed to the plateau in CO(2)during the ACR. Our results highlight the role Antarctic sea ice plays in controlling global CO2, and demonstrate the need to incorporate such feedbacks into climate-carbon models.

TI  - Estimates of CO2 leakage along abandoned wells constrained by new data
AB  - The viability of carbon capture and geological storage (CCS) projects depends in part on the risk that injected CO2 or displaced pore fluid will leak out of the target formation into surrounding formations or to the surface. Abandoned oil and gas wells, of which millions exist both throughout the United States and globally, form a potential conduit for this leakage. Recently, specific field measurements have been made to quantify the range of effective permeabilities that can be expected in abandoned wells, enabling us to, for the first time, combine field-scale numerical simulations of CO2 sequestration in deep saline aquifers with real data on effective permeabilities of leaky wells. Using a previously developed semi-analytical reservoir simulator that can accommodate an arbitrary sequence of alternating aquifers and aquicludes, as well as an arbitrary number of leaky wells, we investigated how the amount of CO2 that leaks out of the target formation depends on the spatial density of nearby abandoned wells and their effective permeability. Furthermore, we assess the influence that variations in pressure and temperature found between geological targets have on this dependency. We find that the observed differences in leakage between geological targets are controlled almost exclusively by differences in density of CO2 at the local subsurface conditions, causing the CO2 plume to contact a different number of wells when injecting at the same constant mass rate. We quantitatively assess the results obtained from our numerical experiments by combining them with the permeability data that have recently become available, typical spatial densities of abandoned wells, and performance requirements put forward in the literature. Our results indicate that leakage of CO2 through abandoned wells is unlikely to be a major limitation in storage security of CCS projects.

TI  - Climate change: Potential impacts and interactions in wetlands of the United States
AB  - Wetlands exist in a transition zone between aquatic and terrestrial environments which can be altered by subtle changes in hydrology. Twentieth century climate records show that the United States is generally experiencing a trend towards a wetter, warmer climate; some climate models suggest that this trend will continue and possibly intensify over the next 100 years. Wetlands that are most likely to be affected by these and other potential changes (e.g., sea-level rise) associated with atmospheric carbon enrichment include permafrost wetlands, coastal and estuarine wetlands, peatlands, alpine wetlands, and prairie pothole wetlands. Potential impacts range from changes in community structure to changes in ecological function, and from extirpation to enhancement. Wetlands (particularly boreal peatlands) play an important role in the global carbon cycle, generally sequestering carbon in the form of biomass, methane, dissolved organic material and organic sediment. Wetlands that are drained or partially dried can become a net source of methane and carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, serving as a positive biotic feedback to global warming. Policy options for minimizing the adverse impacts of climate change on wetland ecosystems include the reduction of current anthropogenic stresses, allowing for inland migration of coastal wetlands as sea-level rises, active management to preserve wetland hydrology, and a wide range of other management and restoration options.

TI  - Groundwater Discharge as a Source of Dissolved Carbon and Greenhouse Gases in a Subtropical Estuary
AB  - Groundwater may be highly enriched in dissolved carbon species, but its role as a source of carbon to coastal waters is still poorly constrained. Exports of deep and shallow groundwater-derived dissolved carbon species from a small subtropical estuary (Korogoro Creek, Australia, latitude âˆ’31.0478Â°, longitude 153.0649Â°) were quantified using a radium isotope mass balance model (233Ra and 224Ra, natural groundwater tracers) under two hydrological conditions. In addition, air-water exchange of carbon dioxide and methane in the estuary was estimated. The highest carbon inputs to the estuary were from deep fresh groundwater in the wet season. Most of the dissolved carbon delivered by groundwater and exported from the estuary to the coastal ocean was in the form of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC; 687Â mmolÂ mâˆ’2 estuaryÂ dayâˆ’1; 20Â mmolÂ mâˆ’2 catchmentÂ dayâˆ’1, respectively), with a large export of alkalinity (23Â mmolÂ mâˆ’2 catchmentÂ dayâˆ’1). Average water to air flux of CO2 (869Â mmolÂ mâˆ’2Â dayâˆ’1) and CH4 (26Â mmolÂ mâˆ’2Â dayâˆ’1) were 5- and 43-fold higher, respectively, than the average global evasion in estuaries due to the large input of CO2- and CH4-enriched groundwater. The groundwater discharge contribution to carbon exports from the estuary for DIC, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), alkalinity, CO2, and CH4 was 22, 41, 3, 75, and 100Â %, respectively. The results show that CO2 and CH4 evasion rates from small subtropical estuaries surrounded by wetlands can be extremely high and that groundwater discharge had a major role in carbon export and evasion from the estuary and therefore should be accounted for in coastal carbon budgets.

TI  - Mangrove rehabilitation dynamics and soil organic carbon changes as a result of full hydraulic restoration and re-grading of a previously intensively managed shrimp pond
AB  - Hydraulic restoration by opening the shrimp pond banks facilitated the establishment of planted mangroves and colonisation by non-planted mangrove species and was shown to be an effective method of mangrove rehabilitation. Planted Rhizophora apiculata and Rhizophora mucronata had grown significantly in 6 years, to 300 and 350 cm, respectively. However, the growth rate of Bruguiera cylindrica was merely 150 cm in the same period despite vigorous growth in the initial stage. About 15 non-planted mangrove species had colonised within 6 years after reopening the banks, with the dominant species being Avicennia marina (46.9\%) followed by B. cylindrica (27.0\%) and Ceriops tagal (14.9\%). After the enhancement, soil organic carbon increased considerably from 110 to 160 tonC ha(-1) in 2 years at the lower elevation, indicating that hydraulic restoration could stimulate carbon recovery through enhancement of mangrove growth. However, soil organic carbon decreased by almost half in the higher ground, suggesting that carbon decomposition was accelerated due to drying of soils.

TI  - The Norwegian CO2-infrastructure initiative: A feasibility study
AB  - The Norwegian debate regarding carbon dioxide (CO2) has focussed considerable attention towards implementation of capture technologies for low-emission gas-fired power plants (Hustad, 2000). Such work has confirmed that capture is technologically feasible, but will currently reduce plant efficiency by between 8 to 10 percentage points and add from +10 to +18 mills/kWh to the cost of producing electricity. About one-third of total avoidance cost is due to final transportation and injection underground-this can be attributed to what is essentially the need for a CO2-infrastructure. The present study proposes to evaluate if CO2-sequestration may be economically handled through developing and optimising such an infrastructure connected to saline aquifers and oil reservoirs for `enhanced oil recovery' (EOR). It is well established that the CO2-storage capacity of the North Sea basin is equivalent to several hundred years of current European power plant emissions. Notably, a large portion of this capacity lies within the Norwegian sector. If feasible, then how extensive should this network be? And what may be the potential socioeconomic benefits such as new jobs, regional investment, technology development, etc. Is it eventually possible to commercialise the handling of European CO2-emissions? Such solutions also need to be considered within the context of evolving GHG-trading mechanisms, and possibly revised legal frameworks renewing existing petroleum and maritime law. Furthermore there may be implications concerning the handling, geological storage, health and safety with respect to CO2. The purpose of the proposed study is to identify all these aspects, and to develop an economic model for optimising the eventual cost of CO2-sequestration. We believe this modelling will contribute to more accurately predicting the real Cost Of CO2-avoidance measures in the future, and provide a comparison with other available options for GHG-reductions.

TI  - Subsurface CO2 storage estimation in Bakken tight oil and Eagle Ford shale gas condensate reservoirs by retention mechanism
AB  - This paper describes the CO2 geological sequestration process in unconventional reservoirs in northern and southern United States such as Bakken tight oil and Eagle Ford shale gas condensate reservoirs. The hysteresis modelling and retention mechanism was performed in this research and this is one of the efficient and proven method to store CO2 in the subsurface. This can be achieved through CO2 EOR process while injecting CO2, the fluid will be trapped in the pore spaces between the impermeable rocks and oil can be recovered simultaneously. A total of four cases was taken for the analysis, such as the Bakken and Eagle Ford reservoirs with CO2 huff-n-puff process and another two cases with CO2 Flooding. Injection pressure, injection rate, injection time, number of cycles, carbon dioxide soaking time, fracture half-length, fracture conductivity, fracture spacing, porosity, permeability, and initial reservoir pressure as is taken as inputs and cumulative oil production, and oil recovery factor was taken as outputs. The reservoirs were modelled for 30 years of oil production and the factor year was taken as Decision Making Unit (DMU) and the models was calculated at each year. The retention was successfully calculated in all four models and percentage of retention above 90% was observed in all four cases and the injection pressure has the most dominating effect on the CO2 geological sequestration. It was also revealed that the CO2 huff-n-puff performance in Bakken reservoir is not that much more effective since the retention rate decreases during soaking period and flooding was found to be a suitable method in this formation. Even in Eagle Ford formation, the average performance of CO2 flooding process is better than the huff-n-puff, but the latter process was quite effective in this shale gas condensate reservoir.

TI  - Analysis on early stage trees carbon storage change of tropical montane rain forest in Bawangling of Hainan Island
AB  - Taking virgin tropical montane rain forest in Bawangling of Hainan Island as study object, four selective cutting experiments of 0.0% (no cutting), 30.7% (low selective cutting intensity), 45.3% (middle selective cutting intensity) and 53.5% (high selective cutting intensity) was implemented. The change tendency of carbon storage of forest stand, dead trees, remained trees, ingrowth trees, tree species group and diameter class thirteen year after cutting was observed and analyzed. The results show that the carbon storage rate of dead trees in forest stand with high selective cutting intensity is the biggest, the carbon storage rate of dead trees in forest stand with middle selective cutting intensity is the least; the growth rates of carbon storage of remained trees and forest stand with low selective cutting intensity and no cutting are higher than that of the others; the carbon storage rate of ingrowth trees increases along with the selective cutting intensity increase; cutting intensity of 45.0% is an ideal to improve carbon storage increasing of trees group; growth rate of carbon storage of remained trees under diameter class of 45 cm increases along with selective cutting intensity increase, the growth rate of carbon storage of remained trees over diameter class of 45 cm isn't related with selective cutting intensity.

TI  - Time-lapse analysis of pressure transients due to ocean tides for estimating CO2 saturation changes
AB  - This study proposed and examined a practical technique for analysing CO2 storage responses using offshore pressure transients affected by the ocean tide. The gravitational attractions of the solar-system bodies cause ocean tides, and the pore pressure exhibits diurnal and semidiurnal fluctuations in response to such tidal phenomena. The pressure-fluctuation amplitude is related to the loading efficiency, which is a function of reservoir elastic properties and fluid saturations. Therefore, the loading efficiency can be used to estimate the in situ pore compressibility and the CO2 saturation. Applying the tidal-signal analysis in a time-lapse manner, one may see temporal changes in CO2 saturation and consequently describe the dynamic behavior of sequestered CO2. In the analysis at the offshore CO2 storage site in Tomakomai, Japan, a temporal decrease in CO2 saturation was detected during the shut-in period, which is caused primarily by CO2 migration away from the well. The proposed methodology essentially requires only continuous pressure data, which are routinely available during CO2 storage operations, and thus, can be a cost-effective and labour-saving monitoring technique.

TI  - Impact of exposure to elevated pCO(2) on the physiology and behaviour of an important ecosystem engineer, the burrowing shrimp Upogebia deltaura
AB  - There is an increasing need to predict the effects of global climate change on ecologically important marine organisms and a demand for proactive solutions to reduce CO2 emissions. CO2 sequestration is one such method. While this offers a practical solution, recognition should be given to the potential for considerable localised effects on marine organisms in the event of leakage. This laboratory study quantifies the impact of exposure to elevated pCO(2) conditions on the physiological and behavioural responses of a relatively tolerant marine organism. Burrowing shrimps Upogebia deltaura were exposed to CO2-enriched seawater for 35 d to treatments of 1396 mu atm (pH 7.64), 2707 mu atm (pH 7.35) and 14 110 mu atm (pH 6.71). CO2 levels represented scenarios which included coastal ocean acidification and extremely elevated CO2 associated with geological CO2 sequestration leaks. Results were compared with those from shrimps maintained in a control treatment (pH 7.99). U. deltaura appeared to be tolerant to elevated pCO(2) predicted to occur in the year 2100 (1396 mu atm, pH 7.64). However, at 2707 mu atm (pH 7.35) shrimps experienced extracellular acidosis, but no difference in haemolymph bicarbonate concentration, suggesting they have little or no buffering capacity, although there was no evidence of other physiological costs in terms of metabolism, osmotic regulation, shell mineralogy, growth and overall activity. At pH 6.71, before 100\% mortality occurred, significant differences in activity were observed compared with shrimps in other pH treatments. Results suggest deleterious consequences for benthic ecosystems in the event of a CO2 sequestration leakage.

TI  - Hydrogen Production as Alternative Energy Through the Electrolysis Process of Sea Water Originating from Mangrove Plant Areas
AB  - This research was conducted by utilizing seawater around mangrove forests, namely multi-functional areas in education. One of the objects of research by electrolysis seawater to determine the content of hydrogen gas is one of the renewable energy that has many advantages compared to other renewable energy. One simple method to produce hydrogen gas is by electrolysis of seawater whose source is unlimited. The electrolysis method in this study uses direct electric current or DC (Power Supply) and seawater with an electrolyte volume of 1000 ml, electrolysis time of 2, 4, 6, 8 minute using Copper electrodes (anode) and Aluminum (cathode) selection of cylindrical reactor types volume 1500 ml, operating conditions 36Â°C and 1 atm. As for the free variables, namely voltages of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 volt. With time variations, the results of the study showed that voltage greatly affects the decomposition of seawater into hydrogen gas. The highest hydrogen gas flow rate results can be at a voltage of 20 volts with 8 minutes of 1.8172 cc/sec (6545.51 ml/hour). The electrolysis time study on the decomposition of seawater into hydrogen gas had no significant effect. The electrolysis time of 6 and 8 minutes at a voltage of 20 and 15 volt showed high hydrogen gas results. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Underground sequestration of carbon dioxide - A viable greenhouse gas mitigation option
AB  - Underground, storage of industrial quantities of carbon dioxide in porous and permeable reservoir rocks has been taking place for the last 5 years at the Sleipner West gas field in the North Sea. Although there is still significant uncertainty in the actual figures, it appears that globally there is enough underground storage capacity for CO2 to make a significant impact on global emissions to the atmosphere. Some of the major issues that must be addressed if this technology is to spread to industrial plant such as power stations, and thus make an impact on global CO2 emissions, are cost of CO2 capture, demonstration of safety and security of storage and public acceptability.

TI  - Assessing rate of deforestation and changes of carbon stock on mangroves in Pahang, Malaysia
AB  - Mangrove forests play an important role as a substantial coastal carbon (C) sink. It is interesting to note that although plant biomass in the ocean and coastal areas comprises only 0.05% of the total plant biomass on land, it cycles a comparable amount of carbon each year. However, despite being a crucial component in the global carbon cycle and having potentially profound influence on climate change, the areal extent of mangrove forests has declined significantly as a result of coastal development, aquaculture expansion and over-harvesting. Pahang, which is the largest state in Peninsular Malaysia was selected as the study area. -in spite of being the largest state, currently Pahang has only about 9,000 ha of mangrove forest out of which about 2,416 ha is under reserve. Although having a small extent of mangrove forest, it is also inevitable from being threatened by these landuse activities. This study was carried out to assess the loss of carbon stock on mangroves forest caused by the changes of landuse. Landsat satellite images over the years 1995, 2005 and 2014 were used to determine the mangrove forest covers and changes. The images were classified and the information on landuse classes has been extracted. Post-classification changes detection has been conducted to assess the rate of deforestation based on permanent changes of landuse occurred within the periods. In the meantime, the total carbon stocks of existed mangroves were determined by using allometry specified for mangroves in Malaysia. From this study, the magnitude of mangroves changes has been quantified and the changes of carbon stocks were determined over the entire state of Pahang.

TI  - Potential for negative emissions of greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4 and N2O) through coastal peatland re-establishment: Novel insights from high frequency flux data at meter and kilometer scales
AB  - High productivity temperate wetlands that accrete peat via belowground biomass (peatlands) may be managed for climate mitigation benefits due to their global distribution and notably negative emissions of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) through rapid storage of carbon (C) in anoxic soils. Net emissions of additional greenhouse gases (GHG)-methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)- A re more difficult to predict and monitor due to fine-scale temporal and spatial variability, but can potentially reverse the climate mitigation benefits resulting from CO2 uptake. To support management decisions and modeling, we collected continuous 96 hour high frequency GHG flux data for CO2, CH4 and N2O at multiple scales-static chambers (1 Hz) and eddy covariance (10 Hz)-during peak productivity in a well-studied, impounded coastal peatland in California's Sacramento Delta with high annual rates of C fluxes, sequestering 2065 Â± 150 g CO2 m-2 y-1 and emitting 64.5 Â± 2.4 g CH4 m-2 y-1. Chambers (n = 6) showed strong spatial variability along a hydrologic gradient from inlet to interior plots. Daily (24 hour) net CO2 uptake (NEE) was highest near inlet locations and fell dramatically along the flowpath (-25 to-3.8 to +2.64 g CO2 m-2 d-1). In contrast, daily net CH4 flux increased along the flowpath (0.39 to 0.62 to 0.88 g CH4 m-2 d-1), such that sites of high daily CO2 uptake were sites of low CH4 emission. Distributed, continuous chamber data exposed five novel insights, and at least two important datagaps for wetland GHG management, including: (1) increasing dominance of CH4 ebullition fluxes (15%-32% of total) along the flowpath and (2) net negative N2O flux across all sites as measured during a 4 day period of peak biomass (-1.7 mg N2O m-2 d-1; 0.51 g CO2 eq m-2 d-1). The net negative emissions of re-established peat-accreting wetlands are notably high, but may be poorly estimated by models that do not consider within-wetland spatial variability due to water flowpaths.

TI  - Costs and performance of an oxygen-blown IGCC plant with CCS on a first-of-a-kind basis in Japan
AB  - The Japanese government recently funded the feasibility study (FS) on conceptual designs for oxygen-blown Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC)+carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems. This paper presents the results of the economic evaluations conducted in the FS. The systems are first-of-a-kind (FOAK) bases with a net output power of 300MWe. It also illustrates a design for a post-demonstration brownfield plant to be constructed in Japan in the 2020s. The study assesses transportation and storage technologies, and site-specific characteristics for transportation by ship and pipeline (PL). With CCS, the construction cost for transportation is the highest (40-60%), closely followed by separation and recovery costs. CCS raises the cost of electricity (COE), of which 30-60% is due to CO2 transportation. The costs of CO2 avoided and CO2 captured show a trend similar to the construction cost. Ship transport is more promising given the flexibility in CO2 storage sites along Japan's coastline and the high unit cost of PL transportation. The overnight cost and levelized COE of the IGCC+CCS plant in the FS (FOAK plant) are relatively higher than those for the plants evaluated in other studies (commercial plants). Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Behavioral responses of Arctica islandica (Bivalvia: Arcticidae) to simulated leakages of carbon dioxide from sub-sea geological storage
AB  - Sub-sea geological storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) provides a viable option for the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) approach for reducing atmospheric emissions of this greenhouse gas. Although generally considered to offer a low risk of major leakage, it remains relevant to establish the possible consequences for marine organisms that live in or on sediments overlying these storage areas if such an event may occur. The present study has used a series of laboratory exposures and behavioral bioassays to establish the sensitivity of Arctica islandica to simulated leakages of CO2. This long-lived bivalve mollusc is widely distributed throughout the North Sea, an area where geological storage is currently taking place and where there are plans to expand this operation significantly. A recently published model has predicted a maximum drop of 1.9 pH units in seawater at the point source of a substantial escape of CO2 from sub-sea geological storage in this region. Valve movements of A. islandica exposed to reduced pH seawater were recorded continuously using Hall effect proximity sensors. Valve movement regulation is important for optimising the flow of water over the gills, which supplies food and facilitates respiration. A stepwise reduction in seawater pH showed an initial increase in both the rate and extent of valve movements in the majority of individuals tested when pH fell to 6.2 units. Exposing A. islandica to pH 6.2 seawater continuously for seven days resulted in a clear increase in valve movements during the first 40 h of exposure, followed by a gradual reduction in activity intensity over the subsequent five days, suggesting acclimation. The ability of both exposed and control bivalves to burrow successfully into sediment on completion of this exposure was very similar. A final exposure trial, testing whether increased valve movements initiated by reduced pH were related to foot extension during attempted burrowing, found no such association. In summary, significant changes in valve behavior did not occur until seawater pH fell to 6.2 units. The response took the form of an increase in valve activity rather than closure. The absence of foot extension coincident with increased valve movements indicates A. islandica were not attempting to burrow, leaving the possibility that valve movements are supporting a respiratory response to hypercapnia. In conclusion, A. islandica appears to be tolerant of reductions in seawater pH equivalent to those predicted for substantial losses of CO2 through leakage from sub-sea geological storage.

TI  - Stand structure and aboveground biomass of a Pelliciera rhizophorae mangrove forest, gulf of Monitjo Ramsar Site, Pacific Coast, Panama
AB  - Mangroves provide several ecosystems services including carbon storage. Aboveground biomass as a proxy for carbon storage and stand structure were investigated in nine plots located in a riverine Pelliciera rhizophorae forest, Gulf of Montijo Ramsar Site, Pacific Coast, Panama. Aboveground biomass for all trees above 2 cm was estimated using common pan-tropical mangrove biomass regression models. Despite a comparatively low tree species diversity there was a considerable variation in stand structure and biomass among the plots. P. rhizophorae dominated the river and center plots with tree densities between 1,275 and 10,075 trees ha-1. Further inland, species composition shifted towards a Rhizophora racemosa dominated forest. Lower density of larger trees in the inland plots may be due to small-scale cutting of trees at the forest margin. Across all plots, P. rhizophorae was smaller in diameter and height than R. racemosa. Aboveground biomass ranged from 76 Mg ha-1 to 335 Mg ha-1 (average: 176 Mg ha-1) and was closely related to stem density and basal area. Compared to other neotropical mangrove forests this riverine P. rhizophorae forest stores substantial amounts of biomass. Conservation strategies have to be put in place to maintain the threatened P. rhizophorae forest in Central America. Â© 2013 Society of Wetland Scientists.

TI  - Experimental evaluation of chemical sequestration of carbon dioxide in deep saline formations
AB  - Deep saline formations are considered to be among the largest and most widely available potential reservoirs for long-term to permanent storage of CO2. However, before deep well injection of CO2 can be considered at terrestrial sites, several prerequisites must be completed, including detailed evaluations of geochemical issues. Because of the many geochemical processes involved, the feasibility of injection will be influenced by the specific chemical interactions that take place between a CO2-rich brine and the native rock. Also, because the characteristic time of the injection (e.g., 20 years) may be either faster or slower than some geochemical processes, the rate behavior of these processes needs to be well understood. This paper presents preliminary results of an ongoing experimental investigation of CO2-brine-rock interactions to answer questions concerning solid phase stability and reaction kinetics. In this study, reactions between a natural sandstone, synthetic brine, and supercritical phase CO2 were investigated. It was postulated that addition of CO2 and subsequent carbonation of the brine could either promote long-term storage by precipitation of carbonate minerals, or interfere with injectivity by reducing the permeability of the formation. Experiments are being conducted using both mineralogically pure samples and rock samples from the Mt. Simon formation in the Midwestern United States and Texas Gulf Coast region. The effects of pressure, temperature, time, and brine composition on mineral transformations are being investigated.

TI  - Evaluation of Soil Organic Carbon Stock in Coastal Sabkhas under Different Vegetation Covers
AB  - There has been increasing focus on conserving coastal ecosystems as they have been recognized as high ecosystem carbon stocks and are in the process of land conversion. The present study aims to examine how different vegetation covers impact the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock in coastal sabkhas. To this end, the study was carried out at ten sampling sites represent ten sabkhas in Saudi Arabia's southern Red Sea coast for two main goals: (1) to examine the vertical distribution of SOC content, SOC density, and the soil bulk density (SBD) based on different vegetation covers, and (2) to assess these locations' SOC stocks. This study posits that sabkhas with different vegetation covers had distinct parameters specified above. Significant SBD differences were observed in sabkhas with different vegetation covers, with the lowest mean values of sabkhas having >75-100\% vegetation cover and the highest mean values of sabkhas having 0-25\% vegetation cover. The studied sabkhas also showed significant difference in the total means of SOC density, SOC content, and SOC stock in terms of different vegetation covers, with the highest mean values of sabkhas having >75-100\% vegetation cover and the lowest mean of sabkhas having 0-25\% vegetation cover. The present study is the first to focus on Saudi Arabia's sabkha blue carbon stocks and its results can help add to the literature on sabkhas carbon stock, thus aiding relevant government agencies working towards sabkhas management, encouraging public awareness regarding sabkhas conservation stocks, and their part in climate change mitigation.

TI  - Analysis: International carbon sequestration pact signed. Environmentalists accuse plans of fudging the issue
AB  - Energy ministers from around the world signed the first international charter supporting the newly created Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum, which sets out how countries should cooperate to develop carbon sequestration technologies. The countries that have so far signed up for the Forum are Australia, Brazil, China, Canada, India, Colombia, Italy, Mexico, Japan, Norway, Russia, UK, US, and the EU. Members of the Forum will have the right to participate in building the world's first emissions-free power plant called FutureGen. Carbon sequestration, where CO2 is captured from power plants and other large CO2 emitters, and stored underground in deep porous rocks, will help nations produce more energy while addressing global warming concerns. According to Statoil, which was the first firm to bury CO2 by injecting it into a layer of sandstone 1000 m under the North Sea, the system works very well and the potential is enormous.

High resolution dissolved CO2, CH4 and Rn-222 (a natural porewater tracer) concentrations were measured over a spring-neap tidal cycle from a mangrove tidal creek located in North Brazil (similar to 0.8 degrees S). Surface water pCO(2), CH4 and Rn-222 ranged from 592 to 15,361 mu atm, 58 to 1469 nM, and 585 to 16,583 dpm m(-3) with considerable temporal variability observed semi diurnally (i.e. hourly) and over the spring-neap cycle (i.e. weekly). Tidally-driven pore-water exchange (tidal pumping) drove surface water pCO(2) and CH4, leading to high concentrations at low-tide (semi-diurnal variability). Higher pCO(2) and CH4 were also observed after the inundation of the upper inter-tidal flat, with peak values coinciding with the ``first flush{''} of aged pore-waters. We hypothesise that additional pore-water exchanges occur during forest inundation in macro-tidal mangrove systems, controlling mangrove creek water pCO(2) and CH4 over spring-neap cycles. Estimated CO2 and CH4 water-atmosphere fluxes were 174 +/- 129 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and 855 +/- 406 mu mol m(-2) d(-1), respectively. These emissions are amongst the highest reported for mangrove systems worldwide and suggests that the most recent global estimates based mostly on data from higher latitudes may have underestimated the role of mangroves in greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Biogeochemical effects of simulated sea level rise on carbon loss in an Everglades mangrove peat soil
AB  - Saltwater intrusion and inundation can affect soil microbial activity, which regulates the carbon (C) balance in mangroves and helps to determine if these coastal forests can keep pace with sea level rise (SLR). This study evaluated the effects of increased salinity (+15 ppt), increased inundation (-8 cm), and their combination, on soil organic C loss from a mangrove peat soil (Everglades, Florida, USA) under simulated tides. Soil respiration (CO2 flux), methane (CH4) flux, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production, and porewater nutrient concentrations were quantified. Soil respiration was the major pathway of soil organic C loss (94-98\%) and was approximately 90\% higher in the control water level than the inundated treatment under elevated salinity. Respiration rate increased with water temperature, but depended upon salinity and tidal range. CH4 flux was minimal, while porewater DOC increased with a concomitant, significant decline in soil bulk density under increased inundation. Porewater ammonium increased (73\%) with inundation and soluble reactive phosphorus increased (32\%) with salinity. Overall, the decline in soil organic C mineralization from combined saltwater intrusion and prolonged inundation was not significant, but results suggest SLR could increase this soil's susceptibility to peat collapse and accelerate nutrient and DOC export to adjacent Florida Bay.

TI  - Rainfall drives rapid shifts in carbon and nutrient source-sink dynamics of an urbanised, mangrove-fringed estuary
AB  - Estuaries provide valuable ecosystem services, such as carbon storage and nutrient retention, which may be affected by episodic rainfall events. This study aimed to investigate the short-term effect of episodic rainfall on alkalinity, dissolved carbon and nutrient biogeochemistry in a small, urbanised and mangrove-fringed estuary. High temporal resolution sampling (1.5-h interval) at upper and lower estuary sites, as well as groundwater sampling, were conducted over two weeks to assess estuarine source/sink dynamics of total alkalinity (TAlk), organic alkalinity (OAlk), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrate, nitrite, ammonium and phosphate. Rapid, short-term changes in estuarine biogeochemistry and mixing were triggered by two episodic rainfall events, which delivered 26 mm over 2 h and 39 mm over 21 h. The estuary was a source for TAlk and DIC exporting 2.2 +/- 1.9 and 2.2 +/- 1.5 mmol/m(2) catchment/d, respectively, to the coastal ocean during the observation period. On average, OAlk accounted for 8\% of TAlk at the upstream and 3\% at the downstream site. Unlike pristine mangrove systems, the estuary was a net sink for DOC, equivalent to similar to 23\% of the DIC source. Rainfall increased catchment nutrient inputs into the estuary, which was a source for ammonium, but a sink for nitrate and nitrite (NOx) throughout the study period. In contrast, phosphate dynamics were less clear. Estuarine biogeochemical transformations affected the exchange with the coastal ocean, driving net TAlk export and by acting as a sink for catchment-derived nutrients. Our high-temporal resolution results suggest that rainfall events rapidly modify estuarine biogeochemistry and mixing, altering the net fluxes of TAlk, dissolved carbon and nutrients to the coastal ocean.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations in the organic carbon accumulation rate in mangrove sediments from the Yingluo Bay, China, since 1900
AB  - Mangroves can not only provide multiple ecosystem service functions, but are also efficient carbon producers, capturers, and sinks. The estimation of the organic carbon accumulation rate (OCAR) in mangrove sediments is fundamental for elucidating the role of mangroves in the global carbon budget. In particular, understanding the past changes in the OCAR in mangrove sediments is vital for predicting the future role of mangroves in the rapidly changing environment. In this study, three dated sediment cores from interior and fringe of mangroves in the Yingluo Bay, China, were used to reconstruct the spatiotemporal variations of the calculated OCAR since 1900 in this area. The increasing OCAR in the mangrove interior was attributed to mangrove flourishment induced by climate change characterized by the rising temperature. However, in the mangrove fringe, the strengthening hydrodynamic conditions under the sea level rise were responsible for the decreasing OCAR, particularly after the 1940s. Furthermore, the duration of inundation by seawater was the primary factors controlling the spatial variability of the OCAR from the mangrove fringe to interior, while the strengthened hydrodynamic conditions after the 1940s broke this original pattern.

TI  - Quantifying the Ocean's Biological Pump and Its Carbon Cycle Impacts on Global Scales
AB  - The biological pump transports organic matter, created by phytoplankton productivity in the well-lit surface ocean, to the ocean's dark interior, where it is consumed by animals and heterotrophic microbes and remineralized back to inorganic forms. This downward transport of organic matter sequesters carbon dioxide from exchange with the atmosphere on timescales of months to millennia, depending on where in the water column the respiration occurs. There are three primary export pathways that link the upper ocean to the interior: the gravitational, migrant, and mixing pumps. These pathways are regulated by vastly different mechanisms, making it challenging to quantify the impacts of the biological pump on the global carbon cycle. In this review, we assess progress toward creating a global accounting of carbon export and sequestration via the biological pump and suggest a path toward achieving this goal.

TI  - Review of solutions to global warming, air pollution, and energy security
AB  - This paper reviews and ranks major proposed energy-related solutions to global warming, air pollution mortality, and energy security while considering other impacts of the proposed solutions, such as on water supply, land use, wildlife, resource availability, thermal pollution, water chemical pollution, nuclear proliferation, and undernutrition. Nine electric power sources and two liquid fuel options are considered. The electricity sources include solar-photovoltaics (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, wave, tidal, nuclear, and coal with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. The liquid fuel options include corn-ethanol (E85) and cellulosic-E85. To place the electric and liquid fuel sources on an equal footing, we examine their comparative abilities to address the problems mentioned by powering new-technology vehicles, including battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs), and flex-fuel vehicles run on E85. Twelve combinations of energy source-vehicle type are considered. Upon ranking and weighting each combination with respect to each of 11 impact categories, four clear divisions of ranking, or tiers, emerge. Tier 1 (highest-ranked) includes wind-BEVs and wind-HFCVs. Tier 2 includes CSP-BEVs, geothermal-BEVs, PV-BEVs, tidal-BEVs, and wave-BEVs. Tier 3 includes hydro-BEVs, nuclear-BEVs, and CCS-BEVs. Tier 4 includes corn- and cellulosic-E85. Wind-BEVs ranked first in seven out of 11 categories, including the two most important, mortality and climate damage reduction. Although HFCVs are much less efficient than BEVs, wind-HFCVs are still very clean and were ranked second among all combinations. Tier 2 options provide significant benefits and are recommended. Tier 3 options are less desirable. However, hydroelectricity, which was ranked ahead of coal-CCS and nuclear with respect to climate and health, is an excellent load balancer, thus recommended. The Tier 4 combinations (cellulosic- and corn-E85) were ranked lowest overall and with respect to climate, air pollution, land use, wildlife damage, and chemical waste. Cellulosic-E85 ranked lower than corn-E85 overall, primarily due to its potentially larger land footprint based on new data and its higher upstream air pollution emissions than corn-E85. Whereas cellulosic-E85 may cause the greatest average human mortality, nuclear-BEVs cause the greatest upper-limit mortality risk due to the expansion of plutonium separation and uranium enrichment in nuclear energy facilities worldwide. Wind-BEVs and CSP-BEVs cause the least mortality. The footprint area of wind-BEVs is 2-6 orders of magnitude less than that of any other option. Because of their low footprint and pollution, wind-BEVs cause the least wildlife loss. The largest consumer of water is corn-E85. The smallest are wind-, tidal-, and wave-BEVs. The US could theoretically replace all 2007 onroad vehicles with BEVs powered by 73000-144000 5 MW wind turbines, less than the 300000 airplanes the US produced during World War II, reducing US CO 2 by 32.5-32.7% and nearly eliminating 15000/yr vehicle-related air pollution deaths in 2020. In sum, use of wind, CSP, geothermal, tidal, PV, wave, and hydro to provide electricity for BEVs and HFCVs and, by extension, electricity for the residential, industrial, and commercial sectors, will result in the most benefit among the options considered. The combination of these technologies should be advanced as a solution to global warming, air pollution, and energy security. Coal-CCS and nuclear offer less benefit thus represent an opportunity cost loss, and the biofuel options provide no certain benefit and the greatest negative impacts.

TI  - CO2 wettability of seal and reservoir rocks and the implications for carbon geo-sequestration
AB  - We review the literature data published on the topic of CO2 wettability of storage and seal rocks. We first introduce the concept of wettability and explain why it is important in the context of carbon geo-sequestration (CGS) projects, and review how it is measured. This is done to raise awareness of this parameter in the CGS community, which, as we show later on in this text, may have a dramatic impact on structural and residual trapping of CO2. These two trapping mechanisms would be severely and negatively affected in case of CO2-wet storage and/or seal rock. Overall, at the current state of the art, a substantial amount of work has been completed, and we find that: Sandstone and limestone, plus pure minerals such as quartz, calcite, feldspar, and mica are strongly water wet in a CO2-water system. Oil-wet limestone, oil-wet quartz, or coal is intermediate wet or CO2 wet in a CO2-water system. The contact angle alone is insufficient for predicting capillary pressures in reservoir or seal rocks. The current contact angle data have a large uncertainty. Solid theoretical understanding on a molecular level of rock-CO2-brine interactions is currently limited. In an ideal scenario, all seal and storage rocks in CGS formations are tested for their CO2 wettability. Achieving representative subsurface conditions (especially in terms of the rock surface) in the laboratory is of key importance but also very challenging.

TI  - Fatty acids as dietary biomarkers in mangrove ecosystems: Current status and future perspective
AB  - The paradigm that mangrove carbon supports secondary production in mangrove and adjacent habitats has been debated in recent years. Fatty acids (FA) are one of the classic biomarkers that have been frequently applied to track mangrove carbon pathways and assess trophic relationships. However, most previous studies did not evaluate the validity, potential and limitations of FA as biomarkers. The function and metabolism of long-chain polyunsaturated FA (LC-PUFA) in mangrove fauna have been largely ignored, and overlapping single FA biomarkers were widely used to infer dietary contributions from different sources. This review aims to systematically analyze and assess the application of FA biomarkers to dietary analyses in mangrove ecosystems, with a focus on basal food sources and their consumers. Our results show that basal food sources have distinctive FA profiles, with leaves and litter rich in alpha-linolenic acids (ALA, 18:3n-3), microphytobenthos rich in eicosapentaenoic adds (EPA, 20:5n-3) and suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM), or phytoplankton rich in docosahexaenoic adds (DHA, 22:6n-3). Most consumers contain high contents of LC-PUFA, particularly DHA and EPA, but very low levels of long-chain saturated FA (e.g., 22:0, 24:0, 26:0, 28:0), a biomarker of mangrove leaf litter. Bacterial FA biomarkers are present in all consumers. Four possible carbon pathways are identified and examined, i.e., benthic feeding on mangrove leaves and litter, benthic feeding on microphytobenthos, pelagic feeding on SPOM, and benthic and pelagic feeding on bacteria. Each pathway plays a different nutritional role for consumers, together providing a diversity of carbon sources. We recommend that in future (a) a wide range of basal diet sources should be sampled rather than just ``visible{''} sources; (b) the unique FA characteristics of each diet source and consumer should be recognized with a focus on overall FA profiles and the application of multivariate statistics; (c) controlled feeding trials should be considered for keystone or functionally important consumers before selecting certain FA biomarkers to infer animal diets, and; (d) compound-specific stable isotope analysis should be applied to provide more insights into trophic relationships as well as the FA metabolic pathways in consumers.

TI  - An evaluation of the economic viability of environmental offsets in the saltworks industry
AB  - The extraction of sea salt depends on the occupation of large areas at the estuary banks, many of them inserted in Permanent Preservation Areas (PPAs). Thus, the objective was to evaluate the economic viability of Environmental Offsets (EO) as an alternative to the unoccupied PPAs in the saltworks. In order to do so, 27 solar saltworks installed in the region of the Brazilian White Coast were evaluated for the occupation of PPAs - measured using images from satellite, georeferenced, vectored with corresponding PPA bands generated - and estimated to EO (Impact Degree x Sum of the investments necessary to implement the project) and Economic Impact (Net Present Value, with long-term interest rate of 7\%) of vacating PPAs. It was considered that EO was feasible whenever the costs resulting from it were lower than the economic impact caused by the vacancy of the PPAs. The PPAs were tthe productive area of the saltworksthat occupied 13.70\% of PPAs. For all the evaluated enterprises the value corresponding to EO was lower than the Economic Impact resulting from the vacancy of the PPAs. Thus, EO is an economically viable and more attractive alternative to the eviction of PPAs by the saltworks industry and may also provide environmental gains due to the financing of conservation units in the areas of influence of the enterprises. However, there is a need to improve the methodology used to estimate the EO, since a maximum limit is set, the environmental impacts caused by the projects are underestimated.

TI  - A new modelling approach to simulate CO2 movement and containment coupled with geochemical reactions and geomechanical effects for an offshore CO2 storage in malaysia
AB  - This paper presents a two-way coupled modelling approach to simulate CO2 movement and containment with geochemical reactions and geomechanical effects. CO2storage simulation studies cover three main disciplines, reservoir engineering, geochemistry and geomechanics. This new approach of coupled modelling simulation, by simultaneously simulate both effects of geochemistry and geomechanics, is considered as a more representative and better predictive modelling practice. The integration of geochemistry and geomechanics effects is important for CO2 sequestration modelling. There are a number of published studies on coupled modelling for CO2 storage. However, the majority of the studies has only covered dynamic-geomechanics or dynamic-geochemistry interaction, without considering any direct geomechanics-geochemistry interaction in a reservoir condition. It is crucial to understand the integrated effects when injected CO2 dissolves into formation water and interacts with formation rock. Depending on in-situ conditions, the formation water with dissolved CO2 could weak or strengthen the formation stress due to geochemical reactions of formation minerals. Therefore, coupled modelling is needed to ensure the long-term safetyof CO2containment at a CO2 storage site with the interactions among geomechanical, geochemical and dynamic fluid flow, and especially to understand the slow and not experimentally accessible mineral reactions. In this paper, a high CO2 content gas field in Malaysia with high temperature (~150Â°C) and high pressure (~350 bar) has been studied using integrated coupled modelling approach. The simulation input parameters are first investigated and collected from literature and laboratory studies. A two-way coupled modelling simulation with the consideration of geochemistry and geomechanics effects is desirable because it allows the updates of reservoir properties back and forth in every time step. Different CO2trapping mechanisms, long term fate analysis, subsidence and heaving analysis, and changes of porosity and permeability are investigated. The time frame of simulation studies consists of CO2 injection period (15 years) and post CO2 injection period (500 years). During the first 15 years of CO2 injection, 95% of injected CO2 is structurally trapped, 4% of CO2is soluted in formation water and 1% is trapped by mineralization. About 0.04m of heaving is observed at the injection area while about 0.05m of subsidence is observed at the production area. In the investigation of long-term CO2fate, it is observed that CO2 gas will be trapped between the lighter hydrocarbon gas layer and aquifer due to density difference.

TI  - Hydrate-based CO2 sequestration technology: Feasibilities, mechanisms, influencing factors, and applications
AB  - CO2 is the primary contributor to greenhouse gas that causes rapid global warming. CO2 capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is a crucial technology for CO2 reduction, typically, CO2 hydrates form at pressures and temperatures greater than 3 MPa and lower than 10 Â°C. These non-harsh environmental conditions determine the value of hydrate-based CO2 sequestration technology, which can be used as a potential effective sequestration measure. In addition, hydrates have the advantages of rapid formation kinetics, high stability, and a low probability of gas leakage; therefore, they can be used to sequester CO2 in the near future. In this review, we summarize the development status and existing problems of various hydrate-based CO2 sequestration methods and analyze the mechanisms, influencing factors, and appropriate sequestration locations. The paper focuses on the CO2 replacement reaction of CH4 hydrates technology. The feasibility of this method is discussed in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics, the mechanism and influencing factors of the replacement process are analyzed, and various methods to improve the replacement efficiency are illustrated, including the temperature and pressure conditions, the injection phase state of CO2, the use of additives, and the assistance of other gases (N2 and H2). Next, the method of direct injection of CO2 into marine sediments to form hydrates for sequestration is discussed. We also generalize appropriate sequestration locations and summarize experimental and simulation studies on CO2 sequestration in marine sediments, including the technical feasibility, sequestration mechanism, and influencing factors. In addition, the hydrate cap is also discussed. Finally, we briefly introduce a hydrate-based CO2 sequestration method for reusing depleted deposits. This review paper can provide insights for future research and may help accelerate the field application of the hydrate method for CO2 sequestration technology. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Estuarine sediment resuspension and acidification: Release behaviour of contaminants under different oxidation levels and acid sources
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) Capture and Storage (CCS) is a technology to reduce the emissions of this gas to the atmosphere by sequestering it in geological formations. In the case of offshore storage, unexpected CO2 leakages will acidify the marine environment. Reductions of the pH might be also caused by anthropogenic activities or natural events such as acid spills and dredging operations or storms and floods. Changes in the pH of the marine environment will trigger the mobilisation of elements trapped in contaminated shallow sediments with unclear redox boundary. Trace element (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) release from anoxic and oxic estuarine sediment is analysed and modelled under different laboratory acidification conditions using HNO3 (l) and CO2 (g): acidification at pH = 6.5 as worst-case scenario in events of CO2 leakages and acid spills, and acidification at pH = 7.0 as a seawater scenario under CO2 leakages, acid spills, as well as sediment resuspension. The prediction of metal leaching behaviour appear to require sediment specific and site specific tools. In the present work it is demonstrated that the proposed three in-series reactions model predicts the process kinetics of the studied elements under different simulated environmental conditions (oxidation levels and acid sources). Differences between HNO3 and CO2 acidification are analysed through the influence of the CO2 gas on the ionic competition of the medium. The acidification with CO2 provokes higher released concentrations from the oxic sediment than from the anoxic sediment, except in the case of Zn, which influences the release of the other studied elements. Slight acidification can endanger the aquatic environment through an important mobilisation of contaminants. The obtained prediction of the contaminant release from sediment (kinetic parameters and maximum concentrations) can contribute to the exposure assessment stage for risk management and preincidental planning in accidental CO2 leakages and chemical spills scenarios.

TI  - Assessing the effectiveness of direct injection for ocean carbon sequestration under the influence of climate change
AB  - This paper studies the effect of climate change on simulated efficiency of carbon injection at different locations and ocean depths using an Earth system model of intermediate complexity, ISAM-2.5D. Following the OCMIP carbon sequestration protocol, we carried out a series of carbon injection simulations. The ISAM results show that warming over the next 500 years under the IPCC S650 and WRE1000 stabilization scenarios could change the ocean circulation and thereby increases the residence time of CO2 disposed into the deep ocean, particularly for Atlantic injection. However, the warming does not have a significant effect on carbon injections into the Pacific and Indian Oceans, where circulation change is small. This new finding contrasts with previous OGCM results. Copyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.

TI  - Baja California Sur mangrove deep peat microbial communities cycle nitrogen but do not affect old carbon pool
AB  - Mangroves provide important ecosystem services, including storing carbon belowground for millennia. Mangrove carbon storage relies in part on high primary productivity, but essential to the long-lived nature of this storage is the slow rate of microbial decomposition of peat. In this study, we (1) examined how carbon and nitrogen densities and microbial community composition vary with peat age and (2) describe the formation of peat deposits over time. At 4 mangrove sites near La Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico, we cored the sediments until rejection and obtained 5 cm samples at 20 cm intervals. In these samples, we measured organic carbon (Corg), total nitrogen, Î´13C, Î´15N, and radiocarbon (14C) age. We observed peat carbon densities of 3.4 Ã— 10-2 Â± 0.2 Ã— 10-2 g cm-3, Corg:N ratios of 42 Â± 3, and inter-site variation in Corg:N that reflects differing preservation conditions. Recalcitrant organic matter sources and anaerobic conditions leave a strong imprint on peat microbial communities. Microbial community composition and diversity were driven by depth and sediment characteristics, including Corg:N ratio and 14C age. Carbon dating allowed us to reconstruct the accumulation of organic matter over the last 5029 Â± 85 yr. Even over this long time scale, though microbes have evidently continuously cycled the peat nitrogen pool, peat carbon density remains effectively unchanged. Â© The authors 2022.

TI  - Impact of an extreme monsoon on CO2 and CH4 fluxes from mangrove soils of the Ayeyarwady Delta, Myanmar
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems can be both significant sources and sinks of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Understanding variability in flux and the key factors controlling emissions in these ecosystems are therefore important in the context of accounting for GHG emissions. The current study is the first to quantify GHG emissions using static chamber measurements from soils in disused aquaculture ponds, planted mangroves, and mature mangroves from the Ayeyarwady Delta, Myanmar. Soil properties, biomass and estimated net primary productivity were also assessed. Field assessments were conducted at the same sites during the middle of the dry season in February and end of the wet season in October 2019. Rates of soil CO2 efflux were among the highest yet recorded from mangrove ecosystems, with CO2 efflux from the 8 year old site reaching 86.8 Â± 17 Mg CO2 haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1 during February, an average of 862% more than all other sites assessed during this period. In October, all sites had significant rates of soil CO2 efflux, with rates ranging from 31.9 Â± 4.4 Mg CO2 haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1 in a disused pond to 118.9 Â± 24.3 Mg CO2 haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1 in the 8 year old site. High soil CO2 efflux from the 8 year old site in February is most likely attributable to high rates of primary production and belowground carbon allocation. Elevated CO2 efflux from all sites during October was likely associated with the extreme 2019 South Asian monsoon season which lowered soil pore salinity and deposited new alluvium, stimulating both autotrophic and heterotrophic activity. Methane efflux increased significantly (50â€“400%) during the wet season from all sites with mangrove cover, although was a small overall component of soil GHG effluxes during both measurement periods. Our results highlight the critical importance of assessing GHG flux in-situ in order to quantify variability in carbon dynamics over time. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Revisiting carbon flux through the ocean's twilight zone
AB  - The oceanic biological pump drives sequestration of carbon dioxide in the deep sea via sinking particles. Rapid biological consumption and remineralization of carbon in the "twilight zone" (depths between the euphotic zone and 1000 meters) reduce the efficiency of sequestration. By using neutrally buoyant sediment traps to sample this chronically understudied realm, we measured a transfer efficiency of sinking paniculate organic carbon between 150 and 500 meters of 20 and 50% at two contrasting sites. This large variability in transfer efficiency is poorly represented in biogeochemical models. If applied globally, this is equivalent to a difference in carbon sequestration of more than 3 petagrams of carbon per year.

AB  - The concentration of carbon dioxide gas in atmosphere is remarkably increasing because of burning fossil fuels, such as coal, natural gas and oil. CO2 is an important Greehouse Gas which results in global warming, and it also threatens human life security and social economy sustainable developing. CO2 geological storage is considered to be a fairly significant way to seal CO2 permanently, it can also slow down global warming. Coals have a super adsorption capacity, especially to CO2, because of the special dual porosity and huge specific surface. Therefore, CO2 can be injected and sequestrated in coal seams by geological storage. Geological storage of CO2 can not only reduces its concentration in atmosphere, but also can enhance coalbed methane production synchronously. The paper discusses CO2 injection and sequestration in coal bed to enhance CBM production mechanism, feasibility and propose a technical route. Experiments show that the technical route of CO2 geological storage to enhance CBM production is feasible, and the technical of CO2 geological storage is good for slowing down globle warming and reducing gas accidents.

TI  - Evaluating 3D and 4D DAS VSP image quality of subsea carbon storage
AB  - In all carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) projects, monitoring, verification, and accounting is required to span short to long periods to ensure plume extents and geologic integrity meet operational and regulatory objectives. Fiber-optic cables permanently deployed in the completions of injector wells enable time-lapse (4D) vertical seismic profile (VSP) imaging using distributed acoustic sensing (DAS). Most CCUS projects are onshore, and the majority of those utilize supercritical CO2 flooding for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). In these cases, fiber-optic installations, acquisition, and analysis are relatively straightforward. Offshore transport and storage projects, whether for EOR or sequestration in saline aquifers, may utilize subsea wells wherein fiber-optic deployment is not as straightforward. Unlike dry-tree wells, DAS of subsea wells requires advanced optical engineering solutions to compensate for the reduced acoustic bandwidth, optical losses, and back reflections accumulated through umbilicals, multiple wet- and dry-mate optical connectors, splices, optical feedthrough systems, and downhole fibers. In this paper, we simulate VSP shot records of a carbon storage site for a variety of proposed subsea DAS concepts and evaluate the 3D and 4D seismic image quality of each using Kirchhoff migration of upgoing seismic wavefields with their expected signal-to-noise ratios. We normalize interrogator performance, so we are evaluating the sensing topology only. We show that a subsea fiber topology consisting of dual transmission fibers, a remote circulator with selective amplification of the backscattered light, and enhanced backscatter sensing fiber results in high-quality seismic images suitable for both 3D and 4D VSPs of carbon storage.

TI  - The evaluate soil quality of mangrove forest in Merauke, Papua
AB  - Mangroves are very important to reduce climate change impact since they have been the indispensably portion of the environment serving different functions such as coastline assurance, obstructing salt water interruption, aquaculture, fodder for post, kindling, charcoal generation and moderating botanical and faunal species. Knowledge of soil quality is important for appropriate decision making regarding sustainable land use systems mangrove forest. Soil quality management helps to maintain biological productivity; air and water quality; and human habitation and health. The objective was to evaluate and identify an effective SQ indicator dataset from different mangrove forest types in the Payum beach Merauke area, the soil quality index are computed for basic of framework soil management system.

TI  - Determining our climate policy future: expert opinions about negative emissions and solar radiation management pathways
AB  - Negative emissions technologies and solar radiation management techniques could contribute towards climate stability, either by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it permanently or reflecting sunlight away from the atmosphere. Despite concerns about them, such options are increasingly being discussed as crucial complements to traditional climate change mitigation and adaptation. Expectations around negative emissions and solar radiation management and their associated risks and costs shape public and private discussions of how society deals with the climate crisis. In this study, we rely on a large expert survey (N = 74) to critically examine the future potential of both negative emission options (e.g., carbon dioxide removal) and solar radiation management techniques. We designed a survey process that asked a pool of prominent experts questions about (i) the necessity of adopting negative emissions or solar radiation management options, (ii) the desirability of such options when ranked against each other, (iii) estimations of future efficacy in terms of temperature reductions achieved or gigatons of carbon removed, (iv) expectations about future scaling, commercialization, and deployment targets, and (v) potential risks and barriers. Unlike other elicitation processes where experts are more positive or have high expectations about novel options, our results are more critical and cautionary. We find that some options (notably afforestation and reforestation, ecosystem restoration, and soil carbon sequestration) are envisioned frequently as necessary, desirable, feasible, and affordable, with minimal risks and barriers (compared to other options). This contrasts with other options envisaged as unnecessary risky or costly, notably ocean alkalization or fertilization, space-based reflectors, high-altitude sunshades, and albedo management via clouds. Moreover, only the options of afforestation and reforestation and soil carbon sequestration are expected to be widely deployed before 2035, which raise very real concerns about climate and energy policy in the near- to mid-term.

TI  - Soil Carbon on Various Land Uses of Mangrove, Derris and Nypa Ecosystems in Segara Anakan â€“ Central Java
AB  - Mangrove is one of the essential ecosystems that absorb carbon most productively and efficiently compared to other ecosystems. Carbon is important to maintain the balance of mangrove ecosystem. However, mangrove carbon content varies depending on the formation of sediment, thickness, and plant composition. The objectives of this study are to assess soil carbon content at various types of mangroves communities and land use in Segara Anakan. Fifty-Eight plots (size of 30 x 10 m2) were selected to determine the carbon storage in the dense mangrove (M1), moderate mangrove (M2), planted mangrove (MT), Derris (D), Nypa (N), Rice fields (S), Shrub (LT), and Terrestrial vegetation (V). Mangrove substrates were taken using an auger in the plots at five ranges of depth. The results showed that the highest carbon and water content wereas found in planted mangroves, followed by dense mangroves. The lowest water content was in paddy fields and terrestrial vegetation, while for carbon content the lowest was found in the shrub. The carbon content of the dense mangrove and planted mangrove were in the range of 4.57 Â± 0.85 - 6.07 Â± 1.18% and 5.02 Â± 0.80 - 7.45 Â± 0.61%, respectively.

TI  - Investigation of terrain effects on the consequence distance of CO2 released from high-pressure pipelines
AB  - As part of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects, Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is usually transported via pipelines from source to sequestration location. Ensuring the safety of the operation is of great importance, as CO2 is a hazardous substance and an accidental release may have catastrophic consequences. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the effects of a CO2 release from CCS facilities is essential to allow the appropriate safety precautions to be taken. The majority of prior studies that address this topic do so by simulating CO2 dispersion over a flat horizontal terrain. However, CO2 pipelines may be deployed near topographically complex locations such as congested industrial or urban areas. The extent to which the complexity of the terrain may affect the area affected by an accidental release has not been explored in detail. In this paper, we present Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models for the prediction of atmospheric dispersion of CO2 over complex terrains, in order to evaluate the â€˜consequence distanceâ€™ relating to accidental CO2 releases from high-pressure pipelines. The CFD model is validated against the results of a heavy gas dispersion experiment carried out at Thorney Island. Simulations of CO2 dispersion over seven types of complex terrain are carried out, considering â€˜full-boreâ€™ rupture of a pipeline carrying a pre-combustion CO2 mixture. The influence of different terrain features on the consequence distance is studied. In addition, the dispersion of a (CO2 + H2S) mixture is simulated to investigate the threshold value of the fraction of Hydrogen Sulphide (H2S) for which the hazardous effects of H2S become significant for a release over complex terrains.

TI  - Carbon sources and trophic levels in the food web of the largest mangrove reserve of China
AB  - Zhanjiang Mangrove National Nature Reserve (ZMNNR) is the largest mangrove natural reserve in China. We conducted the first comprehensive isotope study on the ZMNNR. Primary producers, including mangroves, grasses, microphytobenthos (MPB), etc. formed the lowest trophic level. Gastropods and bivalves, crustaceans and carnivorous fish were on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th trophic levels, respectively. In Zhanjiang tidal estuary, mangroves contributed about 1/3 of the carbon sources for consumers, substantially smaller than those in swamps and lagoons, but higher than those in river delta mangroves. The major carbon sources to the food web shifted from particulate organic matter (POM), consisting of detritus of mangrove leaves and phytoplankton, perennial grasses and mangrove leaves in the high tide zone to invasive Spartina alterniflora, POM and mangrove leaves in the low tide mudflat. Insignificant contributions of MPB were due to restricted light penetration by the dense mangroves in the high tide zone, and prolonged submersion and sediment resuspension in the low tide mudflat. Aquaculture effluents caused substantially higher delta 15N values of all primary producers and consumers in the ZMNNR. In addition, high nutrient content and N/P ratios in aquatic effluents might allow cyanobacteria in MPB to be outcompeted by other fast growing microorganisms. Aquaculture effluents might also contribute to shortened trophic levels and promotion of the dominance of resistant species in the ZMNNR. We call for a sustainable development strategy to conserve the valuable ecosystem in the ZMNNR.

TI  - Assessment of the carbon abatement and removal opportunities of the Arabian Gulf Countries
AB  - The Arabian Gulf Countries (AGC) are strongly reliant on the economic export of fossil fuels, while being vulnerable to climate change that is resulting in temperature increase, air pollution and sea-level rise, and threatening the health of the population and ecosystem. In agreement with the Paris Accords, most of the AGC have published short-term goals to reduce their carbon emissions in the coming decades. In relation to these goals, this study explores the potential CO2 reduction, avoidance and removal in the region, by comparing a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario to three decarbonization scenarios for the power sector. In 2018, the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the AGC were similar to 1333 MtCO(2)/yr and are expected to rise to 1568 MtCO(2)/yr in 2030 following a BAU scenario, which is likely to be reduced to 1522 MtCO(2)/yr in 2030 by following the countries' planning. Countries issued plans for the coming decades that focus on increasing the share of renewable energy in their grid mix. The three decarbonization scenarios presented in this study focus on supply-side technological solutions. The retirement of the oldest natural-gas and oil power plants could lead to a total emissions reduction of similar to 75 MtCO(2)/yr, without accounting for the embodied carbon emissions associated with renewable energy. In addition, the implementation of point-source capture at power plants expected to retire in >10 years' time could avoid emissions of similar to 240 MtCO(2)/yr, provided the CO2 is permanently sequestered in appropriate geological formations. The region also shows high-quality solar resources and large CO2-storage potential that could couple to direct air-capture plants to offset difficult-to-avoid emissions. This last scenario has the potential to ultimately result in net negative emissions. [}GRAPHICS] .

TI  - Salazar: Businesses, entrepreneurs critical to energy future
AB  - US Interior Secretary Ken Salazar focused on the importance of businesses and entrepreneurs in creating a cleaner energy economy in the US. Salazar said the Department of the Interior (DOI) can create rules for clean energy development on public lands, identify proper sites for conventional and renewable energy production, and enforce rules. Salazar said DOI is dedicated to helping the nation construct a detailed energy strategy that includes development of oil, gas, and coal resources. He noted that the Bureau of Land Management has organized 29 onshore oil and gas lease sales so far in 2009 while the Minerals Management Service has organized two offshore lease auctions. He said the US will depend on coal for decades and encouraged US companies to export to countries like China and India technologies that promote carbon capture and sequestration (CCS).

TI  - Outcrop-based reservoir modeling of a naturally fractured siliciclastic CO2 sequestration site, Svalbard, Arctic Norway
AB  - We present a geological model of an unconventional siliciclastic reservoir projected for CO2 sequestration near Longyearbyen, Svalbard. The reservoir is characterized by a substantial sub-hydrostatic pressure regime, very low matrix porosity and -permeability values, extensive natural fracturing and the presence of igneous dykes and sills. Due to the poor reservoir properties of the matrix, flow in the reservoir is largely governed by fracture properties. Input data to the model includes four boreholes, partly or completely penetrating the reservoir section, offshore and onshore 2D seismic profiles and structural and sedimentological data collected from nearby outcrops of the target formation. Combined, these datasets provide firm modeling constraints with respect to the regional geometry, sedimentology and fracture patterns. Previous work has shown that the observed fractures can be grouped into five distinct lithostructural units (LSUs), each exhibiting a characteristic set of properties (fracture density, orientation etc.). The spatial distribution of these LSUs is incorporated into the model. Initial first-order water injection tests using a commercial streamline simulator validate the applicability of this model for further fluid injection tests, including the long-term monitoring of injected CO2.

TI  - CO2 anthropogenic pipeline transportation
AB  - "CO2 anthropogenic pipeline transportation" has been pointed out as one of the most promising way to gather captured CO2 from power plant to permanent underground storage sites for final sequestration or for Hydrocarbon Enhanced Recovery. A lot of efforts have been, till now performed, to develop economically feasible capture systems applicable either on existing (Post Combustion) or new generation (Oxyfuel and Precombustion) electric coal or gas fired power plant; furthermore funds were allocate to individuate and perform deep studies on the geo-stability of underground sink storage (mainly in Aquiferi loci) to be selected by avoiding leaks or to exploit oil recovery from mature wells. Unfortunately few efforts have been put in place to fill the existing gaps of knowledge in CO2 handling and transportation in a safely, efficient and convenient manner. Up to now it was thought to transfer the existing "know how" based on CO2 pipelines transportation for enhanced oil recovery (these pipelines are in service since the 70' in North America) to anthropogenic carbon dioxide, but this approach could be questionable if specific issues aren't properly faced. This paper will address the main differences in terms of issues related to the transportation of these two apparently alike fluids. Furthermore many of the integrated energy Companies around the world recently have decided to sponsor collaborative activities to define guidelines and recommended practices for line design and material procurement as well as to define how to cope with operation and maintenance pipeline issues. There are some relevant technical-feasibility issues to be addressed for an emerging CO2 safe transportation as: -Pipeline integrity, that is fracture propagation avoidance and control as well as environmental assisted cracking prevention (Corrosion and stress-corrosion including the selection of proper material for internal painting/coating); -Safety, that is a deeper understanding of the carbon dioxide release/dispersion phenomenon. This need forces to collect data to validate model(s) to asses the carbon dioxide release (area of interest and consequences) in case of an unlike event of pipeline leak or rupture; -Operational, that is how to avoid hydrate formation. All these issues are strongly related on actual CO2 composition due to the presence of impurities as H2S, CO, Amine, O2, N2 etc. The approach is to deepen the knowledge by perform comprehensive state of the art reviews, later on accompanied by mid scale testing to get the feeling of a real CO2 pipeline behaviour prior to perform full scale testing (highly cost impacting and never performed before) which is the final and necessary step.

TI  - Emission of Greenhouse Gases (CH4 and CO2) into the Atmosphere from Restored Mangrove Soil in South China
AB  - Mangroves are a special ecosystem in tropical and subtropical coastal areas. Currently, it is not adequately understood whether soils in restored mangroves are a substantial source of greenhouse gases. The objectives of this study were to determine whether restored mangrove soils are a substantial source of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) and to identify environmental factors affecting soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes in mangrove sites. From August 2019 to January 2020, CO2 and CH4 flux surveys were conducted in soils at four planted mangrove sites, dominated by Excoecaria agallocha, Kandelia obovata, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, and Hymenocallis littoralis, respectively, in a mangrove reserve in southern China. The results showed that the CO2 and CH4 flux ranges of the four mangrove sites were 0.9432-1.7892 mmol m(-2) h(-1) and -0.104 to 0.845 lmol m(-2) h(-1), respectively. Soil CO2 flux was strongly positively (p < 0.01) correlated with soil organic carbon content and positively correlated (p < 0.05) with soil total N content, temperature, and redox potential. CH4 flux was positively correlated with soil temperature. The results confirm that these restored mangrove soils are only a small greenhouse gases source to the atmosphere.

TI  - Soil organic carbon storages and bacterial communities along a restored mangrove soil chronosequence in the Jiulong River Estuary: From tidal flats to mangrove afforestation
AB  - Among many ecological services provided by mangrove ecosystems, soil organic carbon (SOC) storages have recently received much attention owing to the increasing atmospheric partial pressure of dissolved CO2 (pCO2). Bacteria are fundamental to ecosystem functions and strongly influence the coupling of coastal carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling in soils. The SOC storage and bacterial communities along a restored mangrove soil chronosequence in the Jiulong River Estuary were explored using the 16S rDNA sequencing technique. The results showed the SOC storage in the 100 cm soil profile was 103.31Â±5.87 kg C mâˆ’2 and 93.10Â±11.28 kg C mâˆ’2 for mangroves with afforestation ages of 36 and 60 years, respectively. The total nitrogen (TN) and total sulfur (TS) contents exhibited significant correlations with the SOC in the mangrove soils, but only TN and SOC showed significant correlation in tidal flat soils. Although the tidal flats and mangroves occupied the contiguous intertidal zone within several kilometers, the variations in the SOC storage along the restored mangrove soil chronosequence were notably higher. The Functional Annotation of Prokaryotic Taxa (FAPROTAX) database was used to annotate the metabolic functions of the bacteria in the soils. The annotation revealed that only four metabolic functions were enriched with a higher relative abundance of the corresponding bacteria, and these enriched functions were largely associated with sulfate reduction. In addition, the specifically critical bacterial taxa that were associated with the SOC accumulation and nutrient cycling, shaped the distinct metabolic functions, and consequently facilitated the SOC accumulation in the mangrove soils with various afforestation ages. The general homogenization of the microbial community and composition along the intertidal soil chronosequence was primarily driven by the reciprocating tidal flows and geographical contiguity.

TI  - Optimal global carbon management with ocean sequestration
AB  - We investigate the socially optimal intervention in the global carbon cycle. Limiting factors are (i) increasing atmospheric carbon concentration due to fossil fuel-related carbon emissions, and (ii) the inertia of the global carbon cycle itself. Accordingly, we explicitly include the largest non-atmospheric carbon reservoir, the ocean, to achieve a better representation of the global carbon cycle than the proportional-decay assumption usually resorted to in economic models. We also investigate the option to directly inject CO. 2 into the deep ocean (a form of carbon sequestration), deriving from this a critical level for ocean sequestration costs. Above this level, ocean sequestration is merely a temporary option; below it, ocean sequestration is the long-term option permitting extended use of fossil fuels. The latter alternative involves higher atmospheric stabilization levels. In this connection it should be noted that the efficiency of ocean sequestration depends on the time-preference and the inertia of the carbon cycle.

TI  - Protecting Antarcticaâ€™s coastal blue carbon: a case for international cooperation
AB  - As sea-ice around Antarcticaâ€™s coastlines retracts, a massive â€˜blue carbonâ€™ area is emerging to replace it. This is a growing resource that is predicted to become the worldâ€™s largest natural carbon sequestration area. Given the loss of carbon sinks elsewhere and the existential threat of unabated climate change, this is an incredibly important global good that must be protected and promoted. In this chapter, we explore the legal and diplomatic barriers to that protection and posit potential solutions. In particular, we suggest vertical institutional linkage between the Antarctic Treaty System and the United Nations climate regimes as a way of incentivizing the establishment of global cooperative marine protected areas around Antarcticaâ€™s coasts.

TI  - Sustained-Flux Global Warming Potential Driven by Nitrogen Inflow and Hydroperiod in a Model of Great Lakes Coastal Wetlands
AB  - Wetlands impact global warming by regulating the atmospheric exchange of greenhouse gases (GHGs), including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). We investigated GHG emissions in the Great Lakes coastal wetlands across various hydrologic, temperature, and nitrogen (N) inflow regimes using a process-based simulation model. We found the emission of CH4, N2O, and sequestration of C (i.e., negative net ecosystem exchange, NEE) in our simulations were all positively related to water residence time and N inflow, primarily due to greater plant productivity and N uptake, which facilitated greater C and N cycling rates in the model. Water level scenarios also had an effect on GHG exchanges by moderating the transitions between aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Temperature effects on GHGs were minimal compared with other factors. The net sustained-flux global warming potential (SGWP; i.e., sum SGWP of CH4, N2O, and NEE) of wetlands on 20-year and 100-year time horizons were both primarily driven by CH4 emissions and strongly controlled by the tradeoffs between CH4 emission and CO2 sequestration, with a negligible amount of simulated N2O emissions. Future research could include model enhancements to provide increased process-level details on the aerobic-anaerobic transitions or the direct effects of plants on mediating GHG exchanges. Field studies addressing the interaction of N inflows and water residence time at appropriately large scales are needed to test the complex interactions revealed by our modeling study. Our results highlight the previously under-appreciated role of nitrogen and water residence time in modulating SGWP in coastal wetlands.

TI  - The role of predictive model data in designing mangrove forest carbon programs
AB  - Estimating baseline carbon stocks is a key step in designing forest carbon programs. While field inventories are resource-demanding, advances in predictive modeling are now providing globally coterminous datasets of carbon stocks at high spatial resolutions that may meet this data need. However, it remains unknown how well baseline carbon stock estimates derived from model data compare against conventional estimation approaches such as field inventories. Furthermore, it is unclear whether site-level management actions can be designed using predictive model data in place of field measurements. We examined these issues for the case of mangroves, which are among the most carbon dense ecosystems globally and are popular candidates for forest carbon programs. We compared baseline carbon stock estimates derived from predictive model outputs against estimates produced using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) three-tier methodological guidelines. We found that the predictive model estimates out-performed the IPCC's Tier 1 estimation approaches but were significantly different from estimates based on field inventories. Our findings help inform the use of predictive model data for designing mangrove forest policy and management actions.

TI  - Assessment of CO2 Injectivity During Sequestration in Depleted Gas Reservoirs
AB  - Depleted gas reservoirs are appealing targets for carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration because of their storage capacity, proven seal, reservoir characterization knowledge, existing infrastructure, and potential for enhanced gas recovery. Low abandonment pressure in the reservoir provides additional voidage-replacement potential for CO2 and allows for a low surface pump pressure during the early period of injection. However, the injection process poses several challenges. This work aims to raise awareness of key operational challenges related to CO2 injection in low-pressure reservoirs and to provide a new approach to assessing the phase behavior of CO2 within the wellbore. When the reservoir pressure is below the CO2 bubble-point pressure, and CO2 is injected in its liquid or supercritical state, CO2 will vaporize and expand within the well-tubing or in the near-wellbore region of the reservoir. This phenomenon is associated with several flow assurance problems. For instance, when CO2 transitions from the dense-state to the gas-state, CO2 density drops sharply, affecting the wellhead pressure control and the pressure response at the well bottom-hole. As CO2 expands with a lower phase viscosity, the flow velocity increases abruptly, possibly causing erosion and cavitation in the flowlines. Furthermore, CO2 expansion is associated with the Joule-Thomson (IJ) effect, which may result in dry ice or hydrate formation and therefore may reduce CO2 injectivity. Understanding the transient multiphase phase flow behavior of CO2 within the wellbore is crucial for appropriate well design and operational risk assessment. The commonly used approach analyzes the flow in the wellbore without taking into consideration the transient pressure response of the reservoir, which predicts an unrealistic pressure gap at the wellhead. This pressure gap is related to the phase transition of CO2 from its dense state to the gas state. In this work, a new coupled approach is introduced to address the phase behavior of CO2 within the wellbore under different operational conditions. The proposed approach integrates the flow within both the wellbore and the reservoir at the transient state and therefore resolves the pressure gap issue. Finally, the energy costs associated with a mitigation process that involves CO2 heating at the wellhead are assessed.

TI  - Subsurface development of CO2 disposal for the Gorgon Project
AB  - The Gorgon Project is an LNG Project under development, located offshore of the Northwest coast of Australia. Gas supplied from offshore gas fields in the Greater Gorgon Area will be used to manufacture LNG at a facility on Barrow Island. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is present in the reservoir fluids of the Greater Gorgon Area Fields, and will be extracted from produced fluids prior to gas liquefaction into LNG. The Gorgon Joint Venture participants plan to geologically dispose of the produced reservoir CO2. The Dupuy Formation, a deep saline formation beneath Barrow Island, has been selected for disposal of Gorgon Project reservoir CO2. Subsurface evaluation of the Dupuy Formation for CO2 disposal has focused on reservoir characterisation and narrowing subsurface uncertainty ranges. A seismic pilot to assess acquisition methods and a comprehensive appraisal well have been used to reduce subsurface uncertainty. A suite of robust subsurface models have been used to gauge the impact of CO2 injection on development decisions. Key objectives for the Gorgon CO2 development include well injectivity, surveillance and containment of injected CO2 within the reservoir. A flexible development plan for CO2 disposal for the Gorgon Project has been developed to meet these objectives. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved

TI  - CO2 maritime transportation
AB  - The objective of this study is to describe the complete transport chain of CO2 between capture and storage including a ship transport. This last one is composed by the following steps: Shore terminal including the liquefaction, temporary storage and CO2 loading. Ship with a capacity of 30,000 m3. On or off shore terminal including an unloading system, temporary storage and export towards the final storage. Between all the possible thermodynamic states, the liquid one is most relevant two options are compared in the study (-50Â°C, 7 bar) and (-30Â°C, 15 bar). The ship has an autonomy of 6 days, is able to cover 1000 km with a cargo of 2.5 Mt/year. Several scenarios are studied varying the geographical position of the CO2 source, the number of harbours and the way the CO2 is finally stored. Depending on the option, the transport cost varies from 24 to 32â‚¬/tCO2. This study confirms the conclusion of a previous study supported by ADEME, the cost transport is not negligible regarding the capture one when ships are considered. Transport by ship becomes a more economical option compared with an off shore pipeline when the distance exceeds 350 km and with an onshore pipeline when it exceeds 1100km. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Increase in Growth and Alteration of C:N Ratios of Avicennia marina and Rhizophora stylosa Subject to Elevated CO2 Concentrations and Longer Tidal Flooding Duration
AB  - We investigated the effects of elevated CO2 concentrations and longer tidal flooding duration on two-year-old Avicennia marina and Rhizophora stylosa seedlings for a full year. The seedlings were grown in greenhouses for ambient CO2 (400 ppm) and in enclosed CO2-controlled chambers, which were installed inside the greenhouses for elevated CO2 (800 ppm). The tidal flooding duration was set-up according to the species distribution in the intertidal zone in New Caledonia for the controlled treatment and was increased by 1 h 45min for the experimental treatment. A total of 400 A. marina and 720 R. stylosa were monitored during this experiment. We measured heights and basal diameters of all seedlings every 90 days, and we determined the above and below ground biomass at the end of the experiment. Our results showed that elevated CO2 increased the growth rates of both A. marina and R. stylosa, for which the final biomass was, respectively, 46 and 32\% higher than in the ambient CO2 treatment. We suggest that this increase was driven by a stimulation of photosynthesis under elevated CO2, as demonstrated in a previous study. Considering the tidal flooding duration treatment, we observed a contrasted effect between the species. Longer tidal flooding increased the growth of A. marina, whereas it reduced the growth of R. stylosa in comparison to the controlled treatment. This result may be related to the specific ecosystem zonation in this semi-arid climate, which limits water inputs into the Avicennia zone that increases the salt concentration in the soil, whereas Rhizophora is regularly submerged by tides due to its lower position in the intertidal zone. As a result, the combination of both treatments had a positive cumulative effect on the growth of A. marina. Although it was not the case for R. stylosa, the negative effect of longer tidal flooding on this species did not suppress the enhancement of growth resulting from elevated CO2 concentrations. At the end of the experiment, elevated CO2 increased the C:Nratios of the seedlings, thereby producing a more refractory organic matter, which will potentially result in lower decomposition rates and thus may increase carbon accumulation in mangrove soils. These results suggest that future climate changes may enhance the productivity of mangrove seedlings by increasing their growth, which may in turn increase the carbon storage potential of mangroves in their biomass.

TI  - Factors regulating carbon sinks in mangrove ecosystems
AB  - Mangroves are recognized as one of the richest carbon storage systems. However, the factors regulating carbon sinks in mangrove ecosystems are still unclear, particularly in the subtropical mangroves. The biomass, production, litterfall, detrital export and decomposition of the dominant mangrove vegetation in subtropical (Kandelia obovata) and tropical (Avicennia marina) Taiwan were quantified from October 2011 to July 2014 to construct the carbon budgets. Despite the different tree species, a principal component analysis revealed the site or environmental conditions had a greater influence than the tree species on the carbon processes. For both species, the net production (NP) rates ranged from 10.86 to 27.64Â MgÂ CÂ haâˆ’1Â yearâˆ’1 and were higher than the global average rate due to the high tree density. While most of the litterfall remained on the ground, a high percentage (72%â€“91%) of the ground litter decomposed within 1Â year and fluxed out of the mangroves. However, human activities might cause a carbon flux into the mangroves and a lower NP rate. The rates of the organic carbon export and soil heterotrophic respiration were greater than the global mean values and those at other locations. Only a small percentage (3%â€“12%) of the NP was stored in the sediment. The carbon burial rates were much lower than the global average rate due to their faster decomposition, indicating that decomposition played a critical role in determining the burial rate in the sediment. The summation of the organic and inorganic carbon fluxes and soil heterotrophic respiration well exceeded the amount of litter decomposition, indicating an additional source of organic carbon that was unaccounted for by decomposition in the sediment. Sediment-stable isotope analyses further suggest that the trapping of organic matter from upstream rivers or adjacent waters contributed more to the mangrove carbon sinks than the actual production of the mangrove trees.

TI  - Hidden contribution of shrimp farming effluents to greenhouse gas emissions from mangrove soils
AB  - In the present study, we evaluated CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes in mangrove soils that receive shrimp farming effluents. Soil and gas samples were collected from a mangrove that receives the discharge of shrimp pond effluents and another mangrove forest free of the effluent impacts. CO2 and N2O emissions were significantly higher in the mangrove soil affected by the shrimp effluents (51.4 mg m(2) h(-1) and 90.9 g m(-2) h(-1), respectively) than in the mangrove soil free of the effluents (26.5 mg m(-2) h(-1) and 40.4 g m(-2) h(-1), respectively). No significant differences in CH4 emissions were observed between the two mangroves soils (mean values ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 mg m(-2) h(-1)). Suboxic conditions govern nitrification-denitrification and mineralization processes and control CO2 and N2O emissions from the soil; however, CH4 fluxes were not affected. The highest emissions from the impacted soil (93\% higher for CO2 and 125\% higher for N2O) were attributable to the high content of organic carbon, total nitrogen, and potentially mineralizable nitrogen, which reduce the role of the mangrove in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Power Satellites, Carbon Dioxide, Synthetic Fuel, Sequestering Carbon as Synthetic Oil and Fresh Water from Seawater
AB  - A small number of people have been working for the past year on ways to reduce the cost of power from space to the point that it could entirely displace fossil fuels and even put carbon dioxide back in empty oil fields as synthetic oil. The challenging part is reducing the cost of transport to GEO by a factor of similar to 200 discussed in another paper in this volume. Given low cost power, synthetic fuels, carbon sequestration, and fresh water from seawater become economical.

TI  - Cost reductions in renewables can substantially erode the value of carbon capture and storage in mitigation pathways
AB  - Tackling climate change requires a rapid transition to net-zero energy systems. A variety of different technologies could contribute to this transition, and uncertainty remains over their relative role and value. A growing school of thought argues that rapid cost reductions in renewables reduce the need for carbon capture and storage (CCS) in mitigation pathways. Here we use an integrated assessment model to explore how the value of CCS is affected by cost reductions in solar photovoltaics, onshore, and offshore wind. Low-cost renewables could erode the value of CCS by 15%â€“96% across different energy sectors. Renewables directly compete with CCS, accelerate power sector decarbonization, and enable greater electrification of end-use sectors. CCS has greatest value and resilience to low-cost renewables in sustainable bioenergy/industrial applications, with limited value in hydrogen/electricity generation. This suggests that targeted, rather than blanket, CCS deployment represents the best strategy for achieving the Paris Agreement goals. Â© 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Offshore CCS and ocean acidification: a global long-term probabilistic cost-benefit analysis of climate change mitigation
AB  - Public fear over environmental and health impacts of CO2 storage, or over potential leakage of CO2 from geological reservoirs, is among the reasons why over the past decade CCS has not yet been deployed on a scale large enough so as to meaningfully contribute to mitigate climate change. Storage of CO2 under the seabed moves this climate mitigation option away from inhabited areas and could thereby take away some of the opposition towards this technology. Given that in the event of CO2 leakage through the overburden in the case of sub-seabed CCS, the ocean could function as buffer for receiving this greenhouse gas, instead of it directly being emitted into the atmosphere, offshore CCS could also address concerns over the climatic impacts of CO2 seepage. We point out that recent geological studies provide evidence that to date CO2 has been safely stored under the seabed. Leakage for individual offshore CCS operations could thus be unlikely from a technical point of view, if storage sites are well chosen, well managed and well monitored. But we argue that on a global longterm scale, for an ensemble of thousands or millions of storage sites, leakage of CO2 could take place in certain cases and/or countries for e.g. economic, institutional, legal or safety-cultural reasons. In this paper we investigate what the impact could be in terms of temperature increase and ocean acidification if leakage occurs at a global level, and address the question what the relative roles could be of on- and offshore CCS if mankind desires to divert the damages resulting from climate change. For this purpose, we constructed a top-down energy-environment-economy model, with which we performed a probabilistic Monte-Carlo cost-benefit analysis of climate change mitigation with on- and offshore CCS as specific CO2 abatement options. One of our main conclusions is that, even under conditions with non-zero (permille/year) leakage for CCS activity globally, both onshore and offshore CCS should probably â€“ on economic grounds at least - still account for anywhere between 20Â % and 80Â % of all future CO2 abatement efforts under a broad range of CCS cost assumptions.

TI  - Above-Ground Biomass and Carbon Stock of Ciletuh Mangrove Forest, West Java, Indonesia
AB  - Mangrove forest is a unique ecosystem that plays important roles to climate change control, as carbon sink and CO2 absorbing from the atmosphere. This research was aimed to estimate the potential of above-ground biomass and carbon stocks of Ciletuh mangrove forest, West Java, Indonesia. Mangrove forest area and occupation of dominant species were mapped using Geographical Information System, meanwhile species composition and forest structure was sampled using 198 plots (20 m Ã— 20 m each) systematically spread out at studied forest area. Vegetation analysis data were used to estimate the potential of above-ground biomass and carbon stocks. Above-ground biomass and carbon stock of mangrove species was estimated using allometric models that already available. The results showed that mangrove forest in Ciletuh covered an area amounted to 8 ha. There were 18 tree mangrove species dominated by species of non-Rhizophoraceae belonging to 14 genera of 11 families. Above-ground biomass of Ciletuh mangrove forest was estimated at 31.78 t ha-1, carbon stock at 14.93 t C ha-1, and CO2 absorption at 54.68 t ha-1. Â© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Extended probit mortality model for zooplankton against transient change of PCO2
AB  - The direct injection of CO2 in the deep ocean is a promising way to mitigate global warming. One of the uncertainties in this method, however, is its impact on marine organisms in the near field. Since the concentration of CO2, which organisms experience in the ocean, changes with time, it is required to develop a biological impact model for the organisms against the unsteady change of CO2 concentration. In general, the LC50 concept is widely applied for testing a toxic agent for the acute mortality. Here, we regard the probit-transformed mortality as a linear function not only of the concentration of CO2 but also of exposure time. A simple mathematical transform of the function gives a damage-accumulation mortality model for zooplankton. In this article, this model was validated by the mortality test of Metamphiascopsis hirsutus against the transient change of CO2 concentration.

TI  - Saline-aquifer CO2 sequestration in Japan-methodology of storage capacity assessment
AB  - A nationwide saline-aquifer CO2 storage capacity assessment has been carried out in Japan in two missions: In Mission 1, candidate saline aquifers were classified in terms of the type of geological structure and the amount of data available. Storage capacity for the entire country was then estimated based upon oil and gas exploration data (146 billion tons of CO2). The areas considered in the Mission were located mostly offshore and far from large CO2 emission sources. Mission 2 involved storage capacity estimation in 27 areas in the vicinity of large CO2 emission sources. These areas had been excluded in the Mission 1 capacity assessments. With national-scale geological survey results, a preliminary assessment was performed, and promising sedimentary basins were selected for more detailed examination. To date the overall storage capacity is still under discussion in Mission 2, whereas a systematic way of evaluating data quality and quantity is proposed, and comparative studies on the storage capacity estimation is in progress.

TI  - Enhancing the Supersonic Gas Separation operating envelope through process control strategies of the feed conditioning plant for offshore CO2 removal from natural gas
AB  - Centrifugal Fluid Separation technology, in particular Supersonic Gas Separation (SGS), is one of the potential technologies considered for offshore CO2 capture. SGS has advantages in terms of CAPEX, hydrocarbon losses, footprint, tonnage and power requirement compared to conventional solutions such as membrane. Even though the technology has been developed since 1989, the applications are limited to mainly dehydration and hydrocarbon dew pointing. For CO2 separation from natural gas, substantial development works are needed prior to the field application as there are a lot of uncertainties in the feed conditions to be tackled. In particular, the stringent requirements of cryogenic temperature, high pressure and inlet CO2 composition of its feed require a robust feed conditioning process plant. For a relatively new technology such as SGS for CO2 removal application, it is crucial to investigate and assess the variations of feed and process conditions i.e. temperature, pressure and gas compositions prior to being applied at actual field, as these will impact the CO2 separation performance inside the separator. Hence, this paper investigates the control strategies for the SGS feed conditioning plant subjected to Â±15 % disturbances in temperature and pressure, and Â±5 mol% variations in feed CO2 composition. Results show that effective disturbances elimination in the first flash separator of the feed conditioning plant is crucial in minimizing the impact to the SGS operation. A comparative study reveals that standard PID controller performs significantly better in disturbance rejection than Model Predictive Control. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Carbon sequestration by carbonization of biomass and forestation: Three case studies
AB  - We proposed the carbon sink project called "Carbon Sequestration by Forestation and Carbonization (CFC)," which involves biomass utilization and land conservation by incorporating the products of biomass carbonization into the agents for soil improvement, water purification, etc. Our purpose was to demonstrate the potential of the CFC scheme for carbon sequestration, particularly carbon storage in soil. Case studies were conducted in both developing and developed countries. 1. In southern Sumatra, Indonesia, 88,369 Mg-C year-1 of wood residue from a plantation forest and excess bark from a pulp mill would be converted into 15,571 Mg-C year-1 of the net carbon sink by biochar for soil improvement. The fixed carbon recovery of the system is 21.0%. 2. In a semiarid region in western Australia, the carbonization of wood residue was incorporated with multipurpose projects of a mallee eucalyptus plantation that involved the function of salinity prevention. During the project period of 35 years, the total carbon sink would reach 1,035,450 Mg-C with 14.0% by aboveground biomass, 33.1% by belowground biomass and 52.8% by biochar in soil. 3. In southern Kyushu, Japan, the study was focused on the effective use of surplus heat from a garbage incinerator for carbonizing woody materials. Sawdust of 936.0 Mg-C year-1 would be converted into the net carbon sink of 298.5 Mg-C year-1 by carbonization, with the fixed carbon recovery of the system being 31.9%. Consequently, the CFC project could encourage the creation of a carbon sink in soil. However, we recognize that the quality standard of biochar, the stability of biochar in soil, and the methods for monitoring biochar utilization must be clarified before incorporating biochar carbon into the carbon credit system.

TI  - Sources and sinks of CO2 and CH4 in siliciclastic subterranean estuaries
AB  - Anthropogenic production of greenhouse gases (GHGs) has intensified the need to constrain estimates of natural atmospheric sources from both terrestrial and marine systems. Estuaries are known sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4); however, less is known about GHG dynamics in subterranean estuaries (STEs). We evaluate CO2 and CH4 dynamics in three proximal STEs bordering Indian River Lagoon, Florida, where groundwater flows through siliciclastic sediments with minor carbonate mineral contents. Although the three STEs have similar mineralogical and flow characteristics, CO2 and CH4 concentrations vary by orders of magnitude. Nonconservative mixing of both gases is observed, and CH4 is generally produced while CO2 is sequestered. The extent of methanogenesis is linked to the redox potential of inflowing groundwaters, as well as degree of CH4 oxidation, which results mostly from anaerobic oxidation of methane. Methane concentrations vary by orders of magnitude, and stable isotopic signatures suggest differences in the microbial production pathway between sites. CO2 is sequestered due to the production of alkalinity relative to dissolved inorganic carbon, which occurs both through rapid CaCO3 dissolution at the shoreline as low-pH groundwater from the siliciclastic aquifer interacts with carbonate minerals in lagoon sediments, as well as redox reactions, particularly sulfate reduction and denitrification. These results demonstrate a high variability in CO2 and CH4 concentrations, and thus fluxes, even among geographically constrained and hydrogeologically similar STEs. Although STEs are sources of both CO2 and CH4 to surface waters, the variability of production and consumption complicates global estimates of GHG fluxes from STEs. Â© 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Acute CO2 tolerance during the early developmental stages of four marine teleosts
AB  - Ocean sequestration of CO2 is proposed as a possible measure to mitigate climate changes caused by increasing atmospheric concentrations of the gas, but its impact on the marine ecosystem is unknown. We investigated the acute lethal effect of CO2 during the early developmental stages of four marine teleosts: red sea bream (Pagrus major), Japanese whiting (Sillago japonica), Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), and eastern little tuna (Euthynnus affinis). The percentages of larvae that hatched and survived were not affected by exposure to water with a PCO2 of 1.0 kPa (= 7.5 mmHg) within 24 h. Median lethal PCO2 values for a 360-min exposure were 1.4 kPa (cleavage), 5.1 kPa (embryo), 7.3 kPa (preflexion), 4.2 kPa (flexion), 4.6 kPa (postflexion), and 2.5 kPa (juvenile) for red sea bream; 2.4 kPa (cleavage), 4.9 kPa (embryo), 5.9 kPa (preflexion), 6.1 kPa (flexion), 4.1 kPa (postflexion), and 2.7 kPa (juvenile) for Japanese whiting; 2.8 kPa (cleavage) and &gt; 7.0 kPa (young) for Japanese flounder; and 11.8 kPa (cleavage) for eastern little tuna. Red sea bream and Japanese whiting of all ontogenetic stages had similar susceptibilities to CO2: the most susceptible stages were cleavage and juvenile, whereas the most tolerant stages were preflexion and flexion.

TI  - Comparing carbon in sediment of primary and artificially generated mangrove forests
AB  - Soil from primary/natural and artificially generated mangrove forests from Lamongan, Indonesia, was analyzed for bulk density, carbon content and nitrogen content. Samplings were carried out at a total of 12 stations and up to 1 m depth (0-10, 10-25, 25-40, 40-70 and 70-100 cm). Organic matter contents were analyzed using loss-on-ignition and values were converted to organic carbon content using an accepted conversion factor of 0.58. The results showed that the primary forest had lower bulk density and higher carbon and nitrogen contents than those of the artificial forest. On average, the bulk densities of natural and artificial forests were 0.73 g cm-3 and 0.96 g cm-3 respectively, while carbon contents were 6.39% and 3.67% respectively. Carbon and nitrogen stocks of the primary forest were 477.82Â±70.75 MgC ha-1 and 38.91Â±22.84 MgN ha-1respectively while they were lower at the artificial forest (363.54Â±52.66 MgC ha-1 and 11.75Â±2.54 MgN ha-1 respectively). Higher carbon content on the natural forest significantly contributes to higher amount of carbon stocks in the forest. Carbon/nitrogen ratios were 21 and 31 for primary and artificial mangrove forests respectively. Marine based carbon pools might also play a role in the primary mangrove forest as it had lower carbon/nitrogen ratios. Â© 2018, World Research Association. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of biochar application on greenhouse gas emissions, carbon sequestration and crop growth in coastal saline soil
AB  - To evaluate the benefits of application of biochar to coastal saline soil for climate change mitigation, the effects on soil organic carbon (SOC), greenhouse gases (GHGs) and crop yields were investigated. Biochar was applied at 16tha(-1) to study its effects on crop growth (Experiment I). The effects of biochar (0, 3.2, 16 and 32tha(-1)) and corn stalk (7.8tha(-1)) on SOC and GHGs were studied using C-13 stable isotope technology and a static chamber method, respectively (Experiment II). Biochar increased grain mass per plant of the wheat by 27.7\% and increased SOC without influencing non-biochar SOC. On average, 92.3\% of the biochar carbon and 16.8\% of corn-stalk carbon were sequestered into the soil within 1year. The cumulative emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O were not affected significantly by biochar but cornstalk application increased N2O emissions by 17.5\%. The global warming mitigation potential of the biochar treatments (-3.84 to -3.17t CO2-eq. ha(-1)t(-1) C) was greater than that of the corn stalk treatment (-0.11t CO2-eqha(-1)t(-1) C). These results suggest that biochar application improves saline soil productivity and soil carbon sequestration without increasing GHG emissions.

TI  - CO2/SO2 emission reduction in CO2 shipping infrastructure
AB  - There is an increased focus on the reduction of anthropogenic emissions of CO2 by means of CO2 capture processes and storage in geological formations or for enhanced oil recovery. The necessary link between the capture and storage processes is the transport system. Ship-based transport of CO2 is a better option when distances exceed 350 km compared to an offshore pipeline and offers more flexibility for transportation, unlike pipelines which require a continuous flow of compressed gas. Several feasibility studies have been undertaken to ascertain the viability of large-scale transportation of CO2 by shipping in terms of the liquefaction process, and gas conditioning, but limited work has been done on reducing emissions from the ship's engine combustion. From 2020, ships operating worldwide will be required to use fuels with 0.5% or lower sulphur content (versus 3.5% now) or adopt adequate measures to reduce these emissions. This study explores the use of the solvent-based post-combustion carbon capture and storage (CCS) process for CO2 and SO2 capture from a typical CO2 carrier. A rate-based aqueous ammonia process model was developed, validated, then scaled up and modified to process flue gas from a Wartsila 9L46 F marine diesel engine. Different modes of operation of the carrier were analysed and the most efficient mode to operate the CCS system is during sailing. The heat recovered from the flue gas was used for solvent regeneration. A sensitivity study revealed that the 4 MWth supplied by the â€œwaste heat recoveryâ€ system was enough to achieve a CO2 capture level of 70% at a solvent recirculation flowrate of 90â€“100 kg/s. The removal of SO2 by the ammonia water solution was above 95% and this led to the possibility of producing a value-added product, ammonium sulphate. The boil-off gas and captured emitted CO2 were recovered using a two-stage re-liquefaction cycle and re-injected into the cargo tanks, thereby reducing extra space requirements on the ship. Â© 2019

TI  - Pockmark development in the Petrel Sub-basin, Timor Sea, Northern Australia: Seabed habitat mapping in support of CO2 storage assessments
AB  - The extent to which fluids may leak from sedimentary basins to the seabed is a critical issue for assessing the potential of a basin for carbon capture and storage. The Petrel Sub-basin, located beneath central and eastern Joseph Bonaparte Gulf in tropical northern Australia, was identified as potentially suitable for the geological storage of CO2 because of its geological characteristics and proximity to offshore gas and petroleum resources. In May 2012, a multidisciplinary marine survey (SOL5463) was undertaken to collect data in two targeted areas of the Petrel Sub-basin to facilitate an assessment of its CO2 storage potential. This paper focuses on Area 1 of that survey, a 471 km(2) area of sediment-starved shelf (water depths of 78 to 102 m), characterised by low-gradient plains, low-lying ridges, palaeo-channels and shallow pockmarks. Three pockmark types are recognised: small shallow unit pockmarks 10-20 m in diameter (generally <1 m, rarely to 2 m deep), composite pockmarks of 150-300 m diameter formed from the co-location of several crosscutting pockmarks forming a broad shallow depression (<1 m deep), and pockmark clusters comprised of shallow unit pockmarks co-located side by side (150-300 m width overall, <1 m deep). Pockmark distribution is non-random, focused within and adjacent to palaeo-channels, with pockmark clusters also located adjacent to ridges. Pockmark formation is constrained by AMS C-14 dating of in situ mangrove deposits and shells to have begun after 15.5 cal ka BP when a rapid marine transgression of Bonaparte Shelf associated with meltwater pulse 1A drowned coastal mangrove environments. Pockmark development is likely an ongoing process driven by fluid seepage at the seabed, and sourced from CO2 produced in the shallow sub-surface (<2 m) sediment. No evidence for direct connection to deeper features was observed. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The pros and cons of carbon dioxide dumping: Global warming concerns have stimulated a search for carbon sequestration technologies
AB  - Capture and disposal of CO2 are actively being sought as means to avoid release of the greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. The largest CO2 seabed disposal project was initiated by Norway's state-owned oil company, Statoil, wherein CO2 is being recovered and pumped into a huge aquifer beneath the sea. CO2 disposal is also being considered by other companies such as the Indonesian state-run oil company, Pertamina. However, issues such as the safety and cost of the CO2 disposal must be considered. CO2 disposal into the ocean also faces international and national legal and regulatory challenges since the dumping of CO2 may cause possible degradation on the marine environment.

TI  - Commentary on Sequestering Atmospheric CO2 Inorganically: A Solution for Malaysia's CO2 Emission
AB  - The commentary questions the basis behind an article on accounting and calculating inorganic carbon sequestration services for Malaysia. We point out the omission of coastal vegetated ecosystems. We also bring the author's attention to the problems of using a seemingly resultant chemistry within open systems, in which reactive species come from external sources. In addition, we point out that ecosystem services in the mitigation of climate change must be referenced against a manufacturing process, such as cement's normal lifetime of carbon dioxide sequestration. Without such a reference state, sequestration services may be severely overestimated and when used within a cap and trade system, it will lead to an increased rate of carbon dioxide emissions.

TI  - Spatial Variation of Soil Organic Carbon from Bamen Bay Mangrove in Southern China
AB  - Mangrove forests are large pools of soil organic carbon (SOC) found across the world, and play a vital role in global carbon (C) cycling. In this study, to investigate the effects of spatial factors on SOC in mangrove forests, soil samples at different depth layers from upper estuary (UE), lower estuary (LE), and tidal inlet (TI) in the Qinglangang mangrove forest in Southern China were collected and the differences in SOC among the layers and geomorphological settings were compared. The mean SOC content showed a pattern of LE (4.63 +/- 1.28\%) > UE (2.94 +/- 0.73\%) > TI (1.44 +/- 0.33\%). SOC content and storage decreased with soil depth in TI, but increased in UE. The total SOC storages (0-80 cm) of sites TU, UE, and LE, were 104.41 +/- 16.63, 207.14 +/- 44.83, and 228.78 +/- 19.37 Mg/ha, respectively. The results suggested that top- and subsoil organic C content and storage were largely dependent on their specific location, which underwent different river-sea interactions and human activities. The SOC of the soil profile varied at different sites, implying that the current C storage of mangrove ecosystems can be accurately estimated by quantifying the C of sediments at sites.

TI  - Carbon storage in old-growth homestead windbreaks of small islands in Okinawa: Toward the sustainable management and conservation
AB  - Research Highlights: This study contributes to the improvement of the understanding of ecosystem functions of trees growing outside the forest, by quantifying the carbon sequestration function of a homestead windbreak, for example, a linear forest belt planted bordering a farmhouse in small islands. Background and objectives: Carbon storage in small-scale stands of forests have been less studied compared to that in large-scale forests. The aims of the present study were to clarify the ecological functions of carbon storage and the economic value of homestead windbreaks to propose effective conservation strategies for old-growth homestead windbreaks in the face of climate change. Materials and Methods: On the small islands of Okinawa Prefecture, the dominant tree species used for the homestead windbreaks is fukugi (Garcinia subelliptica Merr.). We collected data on the diameter at breast height (DBH) and the height of 23,518 fukugi trees in 10 villages from 2009 to 2018. Results: The total amount of carbon stored in the remnant fukugi homestead trees of the 10 surveyed hamlets was 6089 t-CO2. The amount is equivalent to the carbon amount that is stored in a 40-year-old Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) forest, a representative tree species in Japan, of 20.9 ha area. Furthermore, the estimated economic value of the homestead trees was equivalent to USD 235,433, in terms of the plantation and management costs of 40-year-old Japanese cedar forests. This study revealed that homestead trees planted in an orderly line usually have a high density; hence, they have a high potential for biomass accumulation, carbon sequestration, and climate change mitigation. Moreover, homestead trees could contribute to a reduction in carbon diffusion, by cooling the house and reducing potential energy consumption. The findings related to homestead trees are consistent with those of other types of trees outside forests or small patches of trees: not adding to future land use competition and highly effective at carbon sequestration. Conclusions: The finding related to the carbon storage of homestead trees will provide basic information, as well as a new perspective on future local conservation and its contribution to climate change mitigation. This study suggests the necessity of the existing trees being properly managed, recruiting trees to be planted to replace old-growth trees, and replanting trees near newly established houses or old homesteads where trees have been cut.

TI  - RECYCLING OF CARBON DIOXIDE TO PROVIDE RENEWABLE ENERGY AND FOR THE MITIGATION OF GREEN HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
AB  - In the wake of overall Industrial and social development of a country the need of energy especially Electricity will continue to grow. The use of fossil fuels like coal and oil has become inevitable in the modern times, either for the production of electricity or for driving automobiles and other transport systems. This is a major contributory factor for the rate of increase in the GHG namely carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Increase in the carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere is a major cause of concern in the conservation of nature and in saving the world from natural disaster which follows atmospheric pollution. Already several procedures are followed to decrease or to prevent the increase in carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere. Capture of carbon dioxide and injecting it into dried up oil wells or deep in the ocean or converting it to some useful organic compounds is already in practice. The procedure we propose is to capture carbon dioxide and convert to carbon monoxide which is a very good industrial fuel gas. This procedure does not involve the use of any expensive catalysts or a new technology. This method does not involve the use of sophisticated equipments and is expected to be cost effective.

TI  - Estimation of carbon pool in soil, above and below ground vegetation at different types of mangrove forests in Peninsular Malaysia
AB  - This paper evaluated the total carbon stock of mangrove ecosystems in two contrasting sites: a fishing village in Delta Kelantan (DK) and Ramsar sites in Johor Park (JP). In both sites, aboveground carbon was significantly higher than belowground carbon, and stems contained more carbon than leaf and root partitions. The average carbon concentration of individual mangrove species (44.9-48.1\%) was not significantly different but the larger biomass of the DK samples resulted in vegetation carbon stock that was higher than that in JP. Season played an important role in soil carbon stock a pronounced wet season in DK coincided with the dry season in JP. The total carbon pool was estimated to be 427.88 t ha (-1) in JP and 512.51 t ha (-1) in DK, where at least 80\% was contributed by soil carbon. The carbon dioxide equivalent was 1570.32 t ha (-1) CO(2)e (JP) and 1880.91 t ha (-1) CO(2)e (DK).

TI  - Scaling mangrove aboveground biomass from site-level to continental-scale
AB  - AimWe developed a set of statistical models to improve spatial estimates of mangrove aboveground biomass (AGB) based on the environmental signature hypothesis (ESH). We hypothesized that higher tidal amplitudes, river discharge, temperature, direct rainfall and decreased potential evapotranspiration explain observed high mangrove AGB. LocationNeotropics and a small portion of the Nearctic region. MethodsA universal forest model based on site-level forest structure statistics was validated to spatially interpolate estimates of mangrove biomass at different locations. Linear models were then used to predict mangrove AGB across the Neotropics. ResultsThe universal forest site-level model was effective in estimating mangrove AGB using pre-existing mangrove forest structure inventories to validate the model. We confirmed our hypothesis that at continental scales higher tidal amplitudes contributed to high forest biomass associated with high temperature and rainfall, and low potential evapotranspiration. Our model explained 20\% of the spatial variability in mangrove AGB, with values ranging from 16.6 to 627.0t ha(-1) (mean, 88.7t ha(-1)). Our findings show that mangrove AGB has been overestimated by 25-50\% in the Neotropics, underscoring a commensurate bias in current published global estimates using site-level information. Main conclusionsOur analysis show how the ESH significantly explains spatial variability in mangrove AGB at hemispheric scales. This finding is critical to improve and explain site-level estimates of mangrove AGB that are currently used to determine the relative contribution of mangrove wetlands to global carbon budgets. Due to the lack of a conceptual framework explicitly linking environmental drivers and mangrove AGB values during model validation, previous works have significantly overestimated mangrove AGB; our novel approach improved these assessments. In addition, our framework can potentially be applied to other forest-dominated ecosystems by allowing the retrieval of extensive databases at local levels to generate more robust statistical predictive models to estimate continental-scale biomass values.

TI  - Petrophysical characterization of deep saline aquifers for CO2 storage using ensemble smoother and deep convolutional autoencoder
AB  - Carbon dioxide sequestration in deep saline aquifers requires accurate and precise methods to monitor carbon capture and storage and detect leakage risks. The assessment of the CO2 plume location during injection and storage depends on the accuracy of the spatial distribution model of petrophysical properties, such as porosity and permeability. This work focuses on stochastic methods for petrophysical characterization and presents a method for the prediction of porosity and permeability using borehole observations and surface geophysical data. This study utilizes injection and monitoring measurements at the borehole locations and time-lapse seismic surveys. The proposed method is based on a stochastic approach to inverse problems with data assimilation, namely the ensemble smoother with multi-data assimilation. Ensemble-based methods are generally unfeasible when applied to large geophysical datasets, such as time-lapse seismic surveys. In the proposed approach, a machine learning method, namely the deep convolutional autoencoder, is applied to reduce the dimension of the seismic data. The ensemble smoother is then applied in a lower dimensional data space to predict the aquifer petrophysical properties. This method updated predictions of porosity and permeability every time new data, either seismic surveys or borehole data, are available, to reduce the uncertainty in the CO2 plume prediction. The method is tested and validated on a synthetic geophysical dataset generated for the Johansen formation, a potential large-scale offshore site for CO2 storage. Â© 2020

TI  - Dynamics of Tree outside Forest Land Cover Development and Ecosystem Carbon Storage Change in Eastern Coastal Zone, Bangladesh
AB  - Tree outside forest (TOF) has immense potential in economic and environmental development by increasing the amount of tree vegetation in and around rural settlements. It is an important source of carbon stocks and a critical option for climate change regulation, especially in land-scarce, densely populated developing countries such as Bangladesh. Spatio-temporal changes of TOF in the eastern coastal zone of Bangladesh were analyzed and mapped over 1988-2018, using Landsat land use land cover (LULC) maps and associated ecosystem carbon storage change by linking the InVEST carbon model. Landsat TM and OLI-TIRS data were classified through the Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) algorithm using Semi-Automated Classification (SAC). In the InVEST model, aboveground, belowground, dead organic matter, and soil carbon densities of different LULC types were used. The findings revealed that the studied landscapes have differential features and changing trends in LULC where TOF, mangrove forest, built-up land, and salt-aquaculture land have increased due to the loss of agricultural land, mudflats, water bodies, and hill vegetation. Among different land biomes, TOF experienced the largest increase (1453.9 km(2)), and it also increased carbon storage by 9.01 Tg C. However, agricultural land and hill vegetation decreased rapidly by 1285.8 km(2) and 365.7 km(2) and reduced carbon storage by 3.09 Tg C and 4.89 Tg C, respectively. The total regional carbon storage increased by 1.27 Tg C during 1988-2018. In addition to anthropogenic drivers, land erosion and accretion were observed to significantly alter LULC and regional carbon storage, necessitating effective river channel and coastal embankment management to minimize food and environmental security tradeoff in the studied landscape.

TI  - Evaluating the relationship between the photochemical reflectance index and light use efficiency in a mangrove forest with Spartina alterniflora invasion
AB  - Mangrove forests, with high productivity, strong carbon fixation ability, and high ecological value, are a critical component of wetland ecosystems. However, in recent years, species invasion is threatening the health of mangrove forests. In order to trace the change and protect them, Light Use Efficiency (LUE) has been used as a significant parameter to estimate the vegetation productivity of mangrove forests. Recent studies have shown that the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) has a strong relationship with LUE. Nevertheless, their relationships undergone significant changes under the influence of vegetation types and external environment. In this paper, we evaluated the relationship between PRI and LUE for different mangrove species (Avicennia marina and Aegiceras corniculatum) and the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on the relationship. The results showed that LUE had a strong correlation with PRI. The correlation of Avicennia marina was slightly higher than that of Aegiceras corniculatum. In addition, LUE values of mangrove forests reduced as a result of Spartina altemiflora invasion. The mean WE value of Aegiceras corniculatum decreased by 27.91\% which was bigger than the decrease in Avicennia marina (23.19\%). Furthermore, Spartina alternifiora invasion weakened the LUE-PRI relationship of mangrove forests. The coefficient of determination (R-2) of the LUE-PRI relationship of Avicennia marina and Aegiceras corniculatum dropped by 19.48\% in total, and 17\% and 25.17\% respectively. This research provides an effective approach to estimate the WE of mangrove forests, which is significant for the evaluation of photosynthetic capacity and productivity of mangrove ecosystems in the future.

TI  - Above- and Below-Ground Carbon Storage of Hydrologically Altered Mangrove Wetlands in Puerto Rico after a Hurricane
AB  - Mangrove wetlands are important ecosystems, yet human development coupled with climate change threatens mangroves and their large carbon stores. This study seeks to understand the soil carbon dynamics in hydrologically altered mangrove swamps by studying aboveground biomass estimates and belowground soil carbon concentrations in mangrove swamps with high, medium, and low levels of disturbance in Catano, Jobos Bay, and Vieques, Puerto Rico. All three sites were affected by hurricane Maria in 2017, one year prior to the study. As a result of being hit by the Saffir-Simpson category 4 hurricane, the low-disturbance site had almost no living mangroves left during sampling. There was no correlation between level of hydrologic alteration and carbon storage, rather different patterns emerged for each of the three sites. At the highly disturbed location, belowground carbon mass averaged 0.048 +/- 0.001 g-C cm(-3) which increased with increased aboveground biomass. At the moderately disturbed location, belowground carbon mass averaged 0.047 +/- 0.003 g-C cm(-3) and corresponded to distance from open water. At the low-disturbed location, organic carbon was consistent between all sites and inorganic carbon concentrations controlled total carbon mass which averaged 0.048 +/- 0.002 g-C cm(-3). These results suggest that mangroves are adaptive and resilient and have the potential to retain their carbon storage capacities despite hydrologic alterations, but mass carbon storage within mangrove forests can be spatially variable in hydrologically altered conditions.

TI  - National blue carbon assessment in Spain using InVEST: Current state and future perspectives
AB  - Coastal and marine ecosystems supply multiple services in which human well-being is highly dependent. However, high-resolution spatial distribution studies of marine ecosystem services are scarce, even if it is known that this information is needed to better manage and conserve these ecosystems. With the aim of filling this gap, in this study we have: (1) mapped and assessed the current capacity of marine phanerogams (Posidonia oceanica, Cymodocea nodosa, Zostera noltii, Zostera marina, and Halophila decipiens) to store and sequester blue carbon in Spain; (2) mapped and assessed the future capacity of marine phanerogams to store and sequester blue carbon under three plausible futures; and (3) assess the economic implications of these scenarios. Our results are based on the InVEST Blue Carbon model and exhibit high spatial resolution (100 m/pixel) of carbon stored in marine phanerogams. We found that 82\% of carbon storage and sequestration by marine phanerogams is currently managed within Natura 2000 areas. However, results from the modeled future scenarios indicate a constant decrease in the amount of carbon stored in these ecosystems by 2050 (24\% lost in the business-as-usual scenario). The economic impact of these losses is equivalent to 17,974 million euro (around 1.6\% of the Spanish GDP). Finally, we consider that a transformative management change is needed to conserve marine phanerogams in Spain, and we discuss the importance of the Natura 2000 Network in managing marine ecosystems and their services in the near future.

TI  - Carbon capture and sequestration versus carbon capture utilisation and storage for enhanced oil recovery
AB  - There are 74 integrated carbon capture projects worldwide currently listed by the Global CCS Institute, including the few already running and those still at the identification, evaluation, definition or execution stage for operation by 2018. Significant funding programmes have recently been launched by the European Commission (NER300 in November 2011) and by the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change (CCS Commercialisation Programme in April 2012) for commercial demonstration projects leading to innovation across the CCS/CCUS technology chain to reduce energy system costs. In their calls for proposals, these programmes were open to both CCS and CCUS projects. However, there are significant technical and commercial differences between projects for enhanced oil recovery and those for permanent storage of carbon dioxide in saline aquifers or in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, the same way that there exist more complexities and limitations for offshore implementation. Such differences are accompanied by different levels of field verification of the various storage and utilisation concepts, with permanent sequestration having only a more recent history and smaller-scale implementation. In this scenario, the need for appropriate due diligence workflows and screening criteria to assess the technical viability and the deliverability of different CCS/CCUS projects remains crucial, vis-A -vis the high component costs, efficiency penalties, reservoir uncertainties and the many challenges related to full chain integration (from carbon dioxide capture to underground sequestration). Based on information in the public domain, this paper reviews the current status of offshore CCS/CCUS implementation worldwide and discusses screening criteria for use by governments, operators and investors alike.

TI  - Characterizing formation damages due to carbon dioxide injection in high temperature reservoirs and determining the effect of solid precipitation and permeability reduction on oil production
AB  - Carbon dioxide injection and its performance during sequestration activities rely on the ability of the injection well to inject the desired amount of CO2for decades. However, the CO2-rock-water interaction may cause immense formation damage by plugging the pores and reducing the permeability. Its severe consequences will reduce oil and gas productivity and CO2 injectivity in the reservoir. In this study a numerical simulator is developed and it solves the fluid flow equations, chemical reactivity equations, particle transport and particles deposition equations to predict the amount of formation damage during CO2 injection. We found that it has high rate of chemical reactivity and dissolution of reservoir rock near the wellbore. The dissoluted reservoir rock particles get precipitated in the reservoir away from the injection well, plugging the pores and reducing the formation permeability. From the simulation result on the effect of reservoir depth and temperature, we found that deep oil and gas reservoirs are good candidates for CO2 sequestration than shallow reservoirs. Because the increased depth and temperature of a deep reservoir decrease the CO2 dissolution rate and lower the solid precipitation. Sensitivity analysis of CO2 injection rates was performed to identify the effect of CO2 injection rate on reduced permeability in deep and high temperature formations. It was found that increased CO2 injection rates and pressures enable to reach miscibility pressure. Once this pressure is reached, there are less benefits of injecting CO2 at a higher rate for better pressure maintenance, no further diminution of residual oil.

TI  - Dynamic modeling of a high temperature CO2-rich giant gas field with a carbon capture and storage strategy
AB  - This paper describes the results of an integrated reservoir study aimed at producing hydrocarbons through a sustainable development from a green High Temperature (HT) giant CO2-rich gas field in the Australian offshore. The development concept addressed the complex challenge of exploiting resources while minimizing the carbon impact. In order to characterize the reservoir in the most detailed way and to describe the fluids behaviour, a 1.8 million active cells compositional model has been built. An analytical aquifer has been coupled in order to represent the boundary conditions of the area. The faults system, interpreted on seismic data by geophysicists, has been included in the simulation model. The selected development plan includes the re-injection of the produced CO2 into the aquifer of the reservoir itself. The supercritical CO2-brine relative permeability curves at reservoir conditions have been provided by Eni laboratories, where the experiments were performed. Therefore, a detailed model has been built with the purpose of: â€“ Defining producing well and CO2 injector well locations, numbers and phasing to evaluate expected CO2 injectivity and CO2 breakthrough issues; â€“ Optimizing the development concept through a risk analysis approach; â€“ Estimating the CO2-rich gas injectivity and storage capacity in the saline aquifer of the reservoir; â€“ Predicting the behavior of the CO2-rich gas after re-injection (breakthrough timing and plume migration); â€“ Maximizing the CO2 sequestration in the reservoir.

TI  - Carbon dynamics and inconstant porewater input in a mangrove tidal creek over contrasting seasons and tidal amplitudes
AB  - Constraining the contribution of mangrove-derived carbon in tidal creeks is fundamental to understanding the fate of mangrove primary production and the role of mangroves as coastal carbon sinks. Porewater measurements and 24-h time series in a mangrove tidal creek were conducted during the dry and wet season, and over contrasting tidal ranges at the Can Gio Biosphere Reserve, Vietnam. Surface water carbon concentrations (dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2))) and their respective delta C-13 values were correlated with radon, suggesting that porewater input drives mangrove-derived carbon in the tidal creek. Based on three complementary mixing models, porewater input contributed to about 30\% of the water volume and 46\% to 100\% of DOC and DIC pools in the tidal creek at low tide, with variabilities between seasons and tidal amplitudes. The creek carbon pool was 88\% DIC, 6\% DOC, and 6\% particulate organic carbon (POC). The pCO(2) values during the wet season (2973-16,495 mu atm) were on average 5-fold higher than during the dry season (584-2946 mu atm). This was explained by a potential greater mineralization attributed to higher organic matter availability and residual humidity that stimulate bacterial activity, and by a potential tidal dilution changing the pCO(2)/DIC ratio as suggested by the Revelle factor. Consequently, average CO2 evasion from the creek was estimated at 327-427 mmolC m(-2) d(-1) during the wet season and 92-213 mmolC m(-2) d(-1) during the dry season, using two independent approaches. Tidal amplitude seemed to influence porewater input and its carbon loads, with a higher contribution during frequent and high tidal amplitudes (symmetric). However, the highest input occurred in a tidal cycle which was preceded by tidal cycle of low amplitude (asymmetric). We explain this ambiguity by the influence of both, rapid water turnover intensifying porewater exchange, and long water residence time enhancing carbon load in porewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A Numerical Study on CO2 Seepage from Offshore Geologic Storage Site
AB  - The objective of the present study is to gain a fundamental understanding on CO2 behavior during the seepage from the geologic carbon sequestration site. To elucidate the seepage behavior in the marine sediment, CO2 bubble dynamics in partially saturated porous media was studied. Force balance on a CO2 bubble in porous media was calculated by considering buoyancy force, surface tension effect and drag force. To consider the effect of porosity, permeability and wetting fluid saturation on ascent of CO2 in porous media, a new surface tension force model was studied. Based on the calculation results, the bubble rising velocity showed strong dependency on porosity and grain diameter. But there was negligible permeability effect. The developed model showed different calculation results with correction factor of force balance. There is no agreement in previous researches whether the escaped CO2 bubble from the marine sediment can be released to the atmosphere or not. To understand the CO2 bubble behavior in the water column, we calculated the dissolution of CO2 bubble in sea water. A molecular diffusion and a convective mass transfer of CO2 bubble were calculated by considering offshore environmental conditions during the dissolution. Based on the calculation results, the bubble dissolution rate showed strong dependency on the initial bubble diameter and bubble rising velocity. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Plugged well leakage risk assessment in a carbon sequestration project
AB  - Carbon sequestration has been proposed as a promising way to mitigate the accumulation of greenhouse gases. Depleted oil and gas reservoirs can be considered as desirable vessel for carbon sequestration. It is crucial to maintain the integrity of formations that contain high concentration of CO2. Plugged wells can be one of the risky leakage pathways which defect the purpose of carbon sequestration. The leak risk of plugged wells should be monitored and evaluated through the whole lifetimes of carbon sequestration activities. Even though numerous researches have focused on the well integrity assessment for carbon sequestration projects, a systematic manner addressed the plugged wells' CO2 leakage in a practical way has not been presented. This study will fill this gap. Lean analysis is performed by using Cause and Effect Analysis (CEA) method and Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) method. CEA is used to identify all the possible causes that could result to the CO2 leakage of plugged wells, while FEMA was implemented to build the plugged well failure modes and evaluate the possibility of CO2 leakage for plugged wells. WH field, a CO2 EOR oil field located in the Gulf of Mexico, is studied as an example to explain how CEA and FMEA could be functioned as effective methodologies to evaluate the CO2 leak potentials of the plugged wells. The plugged wells with high risk of leakage in this field are predicted. Lean analysis is proven to be an effective way to evaluate the risk of CO2 leakage for plugged wells in carbon sequestration activities. The proposed method can also be used in evaluating the integrity of CO2 injection wells and oil production wells in an oil field where CO2 is or will be injected in the future.

TI  - The Promise of Blue Carbon Climate Solutions: Where the Science Supports Ocean-Climate Policy
AB  - The ocean is gaining prominence in climate change policy circles as a tool for addressing the climate crisis. Blue carbon, the carbon captured and stored by marine and coastal ecosystems and species, offers potential as a ``nature-based solution{''} to climate change. The protection and restoration of specific ocean ecosystems can form part of a climate response within climate mitigation policies such as Nationally Determined Contributions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. For mitigation policies that seek to implement management actions that drawdown carbon, ecosystem sequestration and emissions must be measurable across temporal and spatial scales, and management must be practical leading to improved sequestration and avoided emissions. However, some blue carbon interventions may not be suitable as a climate mitigation response and better suited for other policy instruments such as those targeted toward biodiversity conservation. This paper gives context to numerous blue carbon sequestration pathways, quantifying their potential to sequester carbon from the atmosphere, and comparing these sequestration pathways to point-source emissions reductions. The applicability of blue carbon is then discussed in terms of multiple international policy frameworks, to help individuals and institutions utilize the appropriate framework to reach ocean conservation and climate mitigation goals.

AB  - The affinity of the basalt surfaces towards CO2, quantified as wettability functions, is one of the most important driving factors for CO2 trapping capacity and containment security. SiO2 is a minor constituent, often found in traces in the seawater and formation brine injected or reinjected into the sub-surface formations. This work, thus, evaluates the effect of nano-sized SiO2 (100, 1000, and 2000 mg. Lâˆ’1) on the wettability of the basalt rock surface in the pressure range of 5-20 MPa. The results from brine/CO2/rock wettability measurements show that SiO2 nanoparticles turn the CO2-wet basalt surface to weakly water-wet upon aging with nanofluids. About 40% reduction in the measured brine contact angle takes place upon treatment of the rock sample with 1000 mg. Lâˆ’1 nanoparticles. We hypothesize that this change in wettability may facilitate enhanced capillary or residual trapping of CO2 in the basalt formation having adequate porosity and permeability to enhance the basalt CO2 trapping capacity.

TI  - The significance of the erosion-induced terrestrial carbon sink
AB  - Estimating carbon (C) balance in erosional and depositional landscapes is complicated by the effects of soil redistribution on both net primary productivity (NPP) and decomposition. Recent studies are contradictory as to whether soil erosion does or does not constitute a C sink. Here we clarify the conceptual basis for how erosion can constitute a C sink. Specifically, the criterion for an erosional C sink is that dynamic replacement of eroded C, and reduced decomposition rates in depositional sites, must together more than compensate for erosional losses. This criterion is in fact met in many erosional settings, and thus erosion and deposition can make a net positive contribution to C sequestration. We show that, in a cultivated Mississippi watershed and a coastal California watershed, the magnitude of the erosion-induced C sink is likely to be on the order of 1% of NPP and 16% of eroded C. Although soil erosion has serious environmental impacts, the annual erosion-induced C sink offsets up to 10% of the global fossil fuel emissions of carbon dioxide for 2005.

TI  - Insect outbreaks have transient effects on carbon fluxes and vegetative growth but longer-term impacts on reproductive growth in a mangrove forest
AB  - Mangroves are experiencing frequent severe insect outbreaks, and the bud moth larvae (BML; Lasiognatha cellifera) is one of the most common leaf-feeding insects. However, the effects of insect outbreaks on ecosystem carbon fluxes of mangrove ecosystems are not well understood, and more importantly, the relative effects of these disturbances on vegetative and reproductive growth of mangroves remain unclear. We used measurements of plant litterfall, leaf damage percentage, and insect frass production, satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and eddy covariance flux measurements to quantify the impacts of a BML outbreak in 2010 on carbon fluxes and both vegetative and reproductive growth of a mangrove forest. The BML outbreak occurred in 2010 damaged nearly 90\% of the foliage, increased the annual leaf litterfall, and decreased the flower and propagule production. Net ecosystem productivity decreased following the insect disturbance and recovered within several months. There were no significant differences in annual carbon fluxes among the four years from 2009 to 2013. In contrast, the flower production significantly decreased and there was nearly no propagule production after the insect outbreak. Reproductive growth did not recover even two years after the insect outbreak. Our results showed that the BML outbreak had asymmetric effects on vegetative and reproductive growth of mangrove forests. Our findings can help us better understand the impacts of insect disturbances on mangrove ecosystems and also have implications for informing mangrove conservation and restoration efforts.

TI  - Biomass and carbon stocks of Sofala Bay mangrove forests
AB  - Mangroves could be key ecosystems in strategies addressing the mitigation of climate changes through carbon storage. However, little is known regarding the carbon stocks of these ecosystems, particularly below-ground. This study was carried out in the mangrove forests of Sofala Bay, Central Mozambique, with the aim of quantifying carbon stocks of live and dead plant and soil components. The methods followed the procedures developed by the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) for mangrove forests. In this study, we developed a general allometric equation to estimate individual tree biomass and soil carbon content (up to 100cm depth). We estimated the carbon in the whole mangrove ecosystem of Sofala Bay, including dead trees, wood debris, herbaceous, pneumatophores, litter and soil. The general allometric equation for live trees derived was [Above-ground tree dry weight (kg) = 3.254 Ã— exp(0.065 Ã— DBH)], root mean square error (RMSE = 4.244), and coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.89). The average total carbon storage of Sofala Bay mangrove was 218.5 MgÂ·ha-1, of which around 73% are stored in the soil. Mangrove conservation has the potential for REDD+ programs, especially in regions like Mozambique, which contains extensive mangrove areas with high deforestation and degradation rates.

TI  - Assessment of Blue Carbon Storage Loss in Coastal Wetlands under Rapid Reclamation
AB  - Highly productive coastal wetlands play an essential role in storing blue carbon as one of their ecosystem services, but they are increasingly jeopardized by intensive reclamation activities to facilitate rapid population growth and urbanization. Coastal reclamation causes the destruction and severe degradation of wetland ecosystems, which may affect their abilities to store blue carbon. To assist with international accords on blue carbon, we evaluated the dynamics of blue carbon storage in coastal wetlands under coastal reclamation in China. By integrating carbon density data collected from field measurement experiments and from the literature, an InVEST model, Carbon Storage and Sequestration was used to estimate carbon storage across the reclamation area between 1990 and 2015. The result is the first map capable of informing about blue carbon storage in coastal reclamation areas on a national scale. We found that more than 380,000 hectares of coastal wetlands were affected by reclamation, which resulted in the release of ca. 20.7 Tg of blue carbon. The carbon loss from natural wetlands to artificial wetlands accounted for 72.5\% of total carbon loss, which highlights the major task in managing coastal sustainability. In addition, the top 20\% of coastal wetlands in carbon storage loss covered 4.2\% of the total reclamation area, which can be applied as critical information for coastal redline planning. We conclude that the release of blue carbon due to the conversion of natural wetlands exceeded the total carbon emission from energy consumption within the reclamation area. Implementing the Redline policy could guide the management of coastal areas resulting in greater resiliency regarding carbon emission and sustained ecosystem services.

TI  - Simulating CO2 leakage from sub-seabed storage to determine metal toxicity on marine bacteria
AB  - CO2 storage in sub-seabed marine geological formations has been proposed as an adequate strategy to mitigate high CO2 concentration from the atmosphere. The lack of knowledge about the potential risks of this technology on marine bacteria population in presence of metals has lead us to perform laboratory-scale experiments in order to evaluate its consequences. Thus, the effects of Zn and Cd were studied under acid conditions on Roseobacter sp. and Pseudomonas litoralis. Bacterial abundance (cellsÂ mLâˆ’Â 1), growth rates (Î¼, hâˆ’Â 1), relative inhibitory effects of CO2 (RICO2), and production of Extracellular Polysaccharides Substances (EPS) (Î¼gÂ GlucoseÂ cellsâˆ’Â 1) were evaluated. A decreasing exopolysaccharides (EPS) production was found under low pH. Bacterial abundance as well as growth rates showed negative effects. Data obtained in this work are useful to determine the potential effects associated with enrichment of CO2 and metals on the marine ecosystem. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Coreflooding Studies to Investigate the Potential of Carbonated Water Injection as an Injection Strategy for Improved Oil Recovery and CO2 Storage
AB  - Carbonated water injection (CWI) is a CO2-augmented water injection strategy that leads to increased oil recovery with added advantage of safe storage of CO2 in oil reservoirs. In CWI, CO2 is used efficiently (compared to conventional CO2 injection) and hence it is particularly attractive for reservoirs with limited access to large quantities of CO2, e. g. offshore reservoirs or reservoirs far from large sources of CO2. We present the results of a series of CWI coreflood experiments using water-wet and mixed-wet Clashach sandstone cores and a reservoir core with light oil (n-decane), refined viscous oil and a stock-tank crude oil. The experiments were carried out to assess the performance of CWI and to quantify the level of additional oil recovery and CO2 storage under various experimental conditions. We show that the ultimate oil recovery by CWI is higher than the conventional water flooding in both secondary and tertiary recovery methods. Oil swelling as a result of CO2 diffusion into the oil and the subsequent oil viscosity reduction and coalescence of the isolated oil ganglia are amongst the main mechanisms of oil recovery by CWI that were observed through the visualisation experiments in high-pressure glass micromodels. There was also evidence of a change in the rock wettability that could also influence the oil recovery. The coreflood test results also reveal that the CWI performance is influenced by oil viscosity, core wettability and the brine salinity. Higher oil recovery was obtained with the mixed-wet core than the water-wet core, with light oil than with the viscous oil and low salinity carbonated brine than high-salinity carbonated brine. At the end of the flooding period, an encouraging amount of the injected CO2 was stored in the brine and the remaining oil in the form of stable dissolved CO2. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the potential of CWI for improving oil recovery as compared with the conventional water flooding (secondary recovery) or as a water-based EOR (enhanced oil recovery) method for watered out reservoirs.

TI  - Rich soil carbon and nitrogen but low atmospheric greenhouse gas fluxes from North Sulawesi mangrove swamps in Indonesia
AB  - The soil to atmosphere fluxes of greenhouse gases N2O, CH4 and CO2 and their relationships with soil characteristics were investigated in three tropical oceanic mangrove swamps (Teremaal. Likupang and Kema) in North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Mangrove soils in North Sulawesi were rich in organic carbon and nitrogen, but the greenhouse gas fluxes were low in these mangroves. The fluxes ranged -6.05-13.14 mu mol m(-2) h(-1), -035-0.61 mu mot m(-2) h(-1) and -1.34-3.88 mmol M-2 h(-1) for N2O, CH4 and CO2, respectively. The differences in both N2O and CH4 fluxes among different mangrove swamps and among tidal positions in each mangrove swamp were insignificant. CO2 flux was influenced only by mangrove swamps and the value was higher in Kema mangrove. None of the measured soil parameters could explain the variation of CH4 fluxes among the sampling plots. N2O flux was negatively related to porewater salinity, while CO2 flux was negatively correlated with water content and organic carbon. This study suggested that the low gas emissions due to slow metabolisms would lead to the accumulations of organic matters in North Sulawesi mangrove swamps. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Phytoplankton community structure is influenced by seabird guano enrichment in the Southern Ocean
AB  - Phytoplankton biomass, productivity and community structure are strongly influenced by differences in nutrient concentrations among oceanographic water masses. Changes in community composition, particularly in the distribution of cell sizes, can result in dramatic changes in the energetics of pelagic food webs and ecosystem function in terms of biogeochemical cycling and carbon sequestration. Here we examine responses of natural phytoplankton communities from four major water masses in the Southern Ocean to enrichment from seabird guano, a concentrated source of bioactive metals (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) and macronutrients (N, P), in a series of incubation experiments. Phytoplankton communities from sub-tropical water, modified sub-tropical water from the Snares Island wake, sub-Antarctic water and Antarctic water from the Ross Sea, each showed dramatic changes in community structure following additions of seabird guano. We observed particularly high growth of prymnesiophytes in response to the guano-derived nutrients within sub-Antarctic and sub-tropical frontal zones, resulting in communities dominated by larger cell sizes than in control incubations. Community changes within treatments enriched with guano were distinct, and in most cases more extensive, than those observed for treatments with additions of macronutrients (N, P) or iron (Fe) alone. These results provide the first empirical evidence that seabird guano enrichment can drive significant changes in the structure and composition of natural phytoplankton communities. Our findings have important implications for understanding the consequences of accumulation of bioactive metals and macronutrients within food webs and the role of seabirds as nutrient vectors within the Southern Ocean ecosystem.

TI  - Case study on combined CO2 sequestration and low-salinity water production potential in a shallow saline aquifer in Qatar
AB  - CO2 is one of the byproducts of natural gas production in Qatar. The high rate of natural gas production from Qatar's North Field (world's largest non-associated gas field) has led to the production of significant amounts of CO2. The release of CO2 into the atmosphere may be harmful from the perspective of global warming. In this work, we study the CO2 sequestration potential in Qatar's Aruma aquifer. The Aruma aquifer is a saline aquifer in the southwest of Qatar. It occupies an area of approximately 1985 km2 on land (16% of Qatar's total area). We have developed a compositional model for CO2 sequestration in the Aruma aquifer on the basis of available log and flow test data. We suggest water production at some distance from the CO2 injection wells as a possible way to control the pore pressure. This method increases the potential for safe sequestration of CO2 in the aquifer without losing integrity of the caprock and without any CO2 leakage. The water produced from this aquifer is considerably less saline than seawater and could be a good water source for the desalination process, which is currently the main source of water in Qatar. The outcome of the desalination process is water with higher salinity than the seawater that is currently discharged into the sea. This discharge can have negative long-term environmental effects. The water produced from the Aruma aquifer is considerably less saline than seawater and can be a partial solution to this problem. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - South region of the gulf of California large marine ecosystem upwelling, fluxes of CO2 and nutrients
AB  - The Gulf of California Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) is one of the most productive and biologically rich marine ecosystems in the world with a high rate of endemic species. The combination of high biological productivity and biological richness characterizing the region is the result of its unique geology and geography, shaping strong currents and tides that generate the upwelling of cool, nutrient-rich waters. These waters support an extremely high abundance of plankton that in turn is the basis of a complex food web sustaining a diversity of fish, birds, and marine mammals. As Mexico's most important fishery region, the Gulf of California provides seafood to locals and for export to other countries. In addition, manifold coastal lagoons, coastal marine sea-beds, mangrove forests, and 922 islands are important reproductive, nesting and nursing sites for hundreds of resident and migratory bird species. However, even when several oceanographic processes that confer a high productivity to the Gulf of California LME have been documented, there is very little field work to monitor these phenomena, such as coastal upwelling in the southern region, as well as the spatial and temporal variability in nutrient concentrations, the effect of exchange with coastal systems and the role of the Gulf of California as a sink or exporter of carbon dioxide (CO2), for example, in winter the region of the Grandes Islas, there are a source of CO2 to the atmosphere (pCO(2) > 580 mu atm). On this, the records show that in the last 250 years the concentrations of atmospheric CO2 in the world have increased and it has been reported that the ocean daily fixed 2.2 metric tons of CO2, this content has changed from 280 mu atm before the industrial revolution to 407 mu atm in recent times. In the Gulf of California, studies conducted on carbon dioxide (air-ocean flow, dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity) are scarce, and suggest a net flow CO2 from coastal waters into the atmosphere mainly in the region of the Grandes Islas, caused by the intense vertical mixing. In the absence of time-series data on the processes occurring in the southern part of the Gulf, it is necessary to start continuous records of temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH vertical structure and the measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity and nutrients to improve understanding of the biogeochemical structure of the water column and possible exchanges with the coast.

TI  - Underground gas storage: An introduction and UK perspective
AB  - Rising demand and the depletion of its offshore reserves has resulted in the UK becoming a net importer of natural gas. An increased reliance on imports and limited current storage availability mean that the UK faces increasing energy bills and risk of disruption to supply. Because of this the UK government has set about ensuring security of energy supply. Steps taken include the construction of major new pipelines from Norway and Holland and improvements to interconnectors in the southern North Sea. The Government also recognizes that improvements to the gas supply infrastructure are required, including the need for significant increases in gas storage capacity; best met by the construction of underground storage facilities. Focus on energy security has also raised the likelihood of a new generation of coal-fired power-stations. For such a step to be environmentally viable, clean-coal technologies with near-zero greenhouse gas emissions will be required. Underground CO2 storage will be a key element of this strategy. This volume reviews the technologies and issues involved in the underground storage of natural gas and CO2, by means of case-studies and examples from the UK and also from overseas. The potential for underground storage of other gases such as hydrogen, or compressed air linked to renewable sources is also reviewed. Â© The Geological Society of London 2009.

TI  - Techno-economic feasibility analysis of hybrid renewable energy system using improved version of particle swarm optimization
AB  - The present paper presents an improved version of particle swarm optimization method for obtaining unit sizing and techno-economic feasibility analysis of off-grid hybrid energy system for Sundarban region, world's largest mangrove forest located partly in West Bengal, India considering the real load data and other meteorological parameters. Initially the hybrid energy system is designed keeping in mind the load pattern and the availability of the renewable sources of that specific location. The hybrid system is designed with the combination of different renewable energy sources like wind turbines, solar panels along with battery and diesel generator to meet the localized load demand in different hours. Net present cost (NPC) and cost of energy (COE) for power generation have been considered to obtain the optimal unit sizing of the system. Emission from the hybrid system is also considered and compared with a conventional energy system in terms of emission per unit of generation and it is seen that with the implementation of this hybrid system, 0.688Kg of CO 2 emission per unit generation of electricity can be reduced while meeting the local demand. It is also seen that the improved version of particle swarm optimization technique is quite capable of solving this complex non-linear optimization problem quite efficiently. Â© 2012 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Soil Organic Carbon Pools Under Switchgrass Grown as a Bioenergy Crop Compared to Other Conventional Crops
AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) has been proposed as a sustainable bioenergy crop because of its high yield potential, adaptation to marginal sites, and tolerance to water and nutrient limitations. A better understanding of the potential effects of biomass energy crop production practices on soil biological properties and organic matter,dynamics is critical to its production. Our objective was to evaluate changes in C pools under a warm-season perennial switchgrass in different soils compared to typically-grown crops collected at College Station, Dallas, and Stephenville, TX in February 2001. Sampling depths were 0-5, 5-15, and 15-30 cm. Switchgrass increased soil organic C (SOC), soil microbial biomass C (SMBC), mineralizable C, and particulate organic matter C (POM-C) compared to conventional cropping systems. Soil C concentrations were in the order: long-term coastal bermudagrass [}Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] > switchgrass or kleingrass (Panicum coloratum, L.) planted in 1992 > switchgrass 1997 > conventional cropping systems. Soil C concentrations tended to increase with increasing clay content. Greater microbial biomass C followed the order of Dallas > College Station > Stephenville, and ranged from approximately 180 mg C kg(-1) soil at Stephenville to 1 900 mg C kg(-1) soil at Dallas. Particulate organic C was more sensitive than other fractions to management, increasing as much as 6-fold under long-term coastal bermudagrass compared to conventional cropping systems. Our study indicated that conversion of conventional cropping systems into switchgrass production can sequestrate more SOC and improve soil biological properties in the southern USA.

TI  - COMPARISON OF PRECOMBUSTION AND POSTCOMBUSTION CARBON REMOVAL
AB  - Conventional approaches to reduce CO2 emissions, including fuel switching among fossil fuels, renewables, nuclear, end-use conservation, and increased efficiency, nearly all lead to reduction in coal use. Carbon removal technologies alone have the potential to allow continued use of coal. All approaches must compete economically, technically, and environmentally for market share within the context of the total energy system. MARKAL, a dynamic energy systems model, was used to simulate this competition through 2025 for the U.S. energy system. Three carbon removal technologies were evaluated: CO2 scrubbing from coal-fired power plant flue gas, CO2 separation during coal gasification, and carbon separation in the Hydrocarb process. CO2 was sequestered in depleted gas wells and the deep ocean, and solid carbon in depleted coal mines. All three technologies evaluated offer a more cost-effective path to CO2 emission reduction than the reference case. Moreover, the ability of pre-combustion methods of carbon removal can be combined with producing motor fuels as well as electric power fuels, a combination that provided greater opportunity for carbon removal.

TI  - CO2 sequestration in deepwater sediments: Optimization and parametric studies
AB  - CO2 injection and storage in deepwater sediments under water depths greater than 9,000 feet (â‰ˆ2,750 meters) where high pressures and low temperatures result in the CO2 being denser than seawater and therefore being buoyantly trapped in the sediments pore-fluid, could provide an attractive sequestration option for countries and regions densely populated and emitting large quantities of anthropogenic CO2 such as East and West Coasts of the United States of America, Japan, the East Coast of China and Western Europe. In these places, public opinion, government regulatory agencies, a lack of space for CO2 injection sites and few depleted oil and gas fields available necessitate the application of alternative technologies to sequester CO2 in order to mitigate a significant part of the 30 billion tons of CO2 annually released in the Earth's atmosphere. This paper presents the results of multiple reservoir simulations and parametric studies for different types of deepwater sediments located in various regions of the globe (Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Japan Sea and Gulf of Mexico). Since not all regions and sediments deposited below 9,000 feet of ocean waters seem to be viable to permanently store CO2, this study focuses on the critical parameters that need to be considered to successfully inject and permanently store liquid CO2 in deepwater sub-seabed sediments. In fact, when injecting liquid CO2 through an ultra-deepwater conduit (injection pressurized riser) within the first few hundreds of sediments, several uncertain variables such as temperature, sediment type, sediment thickness, permeability, porosity and CO2 injectability greatly influence the overall integrity of the buoyant trap. Very long-time reservoir simulations (e.g. 250 years) have been used to assess the effects of different decision and uncertain variables on the behavior and the evolution of the CO2 plume within the sediments. Also, experimental design and response surface methodologies have been used to quantify the risk associated with each of the critical parameters and to determine the optimal conditions for deepwater sediments CO2 storage. Finally, the essential findings of the paper provide the offshore and carbon sequestration industries with a high-level mapping of the world's oceans and deep seas best candidates for CO2 storage in deepwater sediments.

TI  - Economic evaluation of CO2 ocean sequestration in Korea
AB  - In 2005, Korea launched several carbon management R\&D projects as one of the governmental global climate change policies, specifically about the CO2 storage in geologic and oceanic reservoirs. CO2 ocean sequestrations have been developed as an effective method to sequester amount capacity of CO2, because the capacity of terrestrial sequestration sites on land is very limited in Korea. However, cost- ineffectiveness has been indicated as one of the key barriers. In this paper, the preliminary evaluation of the technical and economic feasibility by the ``Moving Ship{''} method in Korea is carried out and its prospects are outlined. Also, we try to discuss the issues of elemental technologies and emphasize the necessity of continuing R\&D efforts for the effective system development of CO2 ocean sequestration.

TI  - Exploring low-carbon landscape design: Focus on an urban waterfront area
AB  - Sustainable designs like low-carbon landscapes are key to lowering the anthropogenic carbon footprint of our society and promoting harmony with natural ecosystems. We can design low-carbon landscapes for terrestrial (e.g. forests and urban farming areas) as well as aquatic (e.g. urban streams, ponds, and wetlands) urban spaces. Ecological interactions between water and soil in an urban ecosystem cause high carbon accumulation rates, especially in waterfront areas. Furthermore, heat absorption at waterfronts also significantly mitigates urban heat island effect. Therefore, urban open spaces with waterfronts are ecologically vital and may help us cope with climate change. However, the design and application of urban low-carbon landscapes are still in the conceptual phase and the creation a low carbon city remains as a preliminary draft. At present, there are very few studies measuring carbon emissions and carbon absorptions in the urban area. Moreover, studies that analyze low-carbon landscape components and their social effects are needed. In this study, we propose a novel conceptual definition of low-carbon landscape and investigate the research methods related to low-carbon landscape design. We have also listed numerous case studies of urban waterfronts scrutinizing the various components of a low-carbon landscape. Â© 2014 WIT Press.

TI  - Evaluating, predicting and mapping belowground carbon stores in Kenyan mangroves
AB  - Despite covering only approximately 138 000 km(2), mangroves are globally important carbon sinks with carbon density values three to four times that of terrestrial forests. A key challenge in evaluating the carbon benefits from mangrove forest conservation is the lack of rigorous spatially resolved estimates of mangrove sediment carbon stocks; most mangrove carbon is stored belowground. Previous work has focused on detailed estimations of carbon stores over relatively small areas, which has obvious limitations in terms of generality and scope of application. Most studies have focused only on quantifying the top 1 m of belowground carbon (BGC). Carbon stored at depths beyond 1 m, and the effects of mangrove species, location and environmental context on these stores, are poorly studied. This study investigated these variables at two sites (Gazi and Vanga in the south of Kenya) and used the data to produce a country-specific BGC predictive model for Kenya and map BGC store estimates throughout Kenya at spatial scales relevant for climate change research, forest management and REDD+ (reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation). The results revealed that mangrove species was the most reliable predictor of BGC; Rhizophora muronata had the highest mean BGC with 1485.5 t C ha(-1). Applying the species-based predictive model to a base map of species distribution in Kenya for the year 2010 with a 2.5 m(2) resolution produced an estimate of 69.41 Mt C [}+/- 9.15 95\% confidence interval (C.I.)] for BGC in Kenyan mangroves. When applied to a 1992 mangrove distribution map, the BGC estimate was 75.65 Mt C (+/- 12.21 95\% C.I.), an 8.3\% loss in BGC stores between 1992 and 2010 in Kenya. The country-level mangrove map provides a valuable tool for assessing carbon stocks and visualizing the distribution of BGC. Estimates at the 2.5 m(2) resolution provide sufficient details for highlighting and prioritizing areas for mangrove conservation and restoration.

AB  - The phytoplankton of the upper ocean remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by photosynthesis. Their detritus or that of their grazers falls into the deeper ocean taking carbon with it. The ocean uptake of carbon dioxide is limited by the availability of nitrogen in the upper waters over much of the global ocean. This paper examines the cost of providing nitrogen to the upper ocean from a pilot plant with a capacity to sequester 2,000,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. The plant would provide reactive nitrogen at the edge of the continental shelf and monitor the enhanced phytoplankton growth by satellite. The costs compare very favourably with other strategies of carbon dioxide capture and direct placement in carbon sinks. This comes about because the capture mechanism exploits solar energy and the large surface area of the ocean. The sequestration is shown to be permanent and not dependent on the overturning time of the ocean. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Exposure to carbon dioxide-rich seawater is stressful for some deep-sea species: an in situ, behavioral study
AB  - Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, the concentration of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased from 275 to 370 ppm; the increase is thought to have caused much of the rise in global temperature that has occurred during the same period. A means of mitigating its effects is to collect industrial carbon dioxide and sequester it in the deep ocean. Knowledge of effects of such sequestration on deep-sea organisms is crucial to evaluation of the wisdom of deep-ocean sequestration. We therefore tested deep-sea animals for indications that exposure to carbon dioxide-rich seawater is stressful, Our study site was at 3087 rn depth off the coast of central California (36 degrees 41.91'N, 123 degrees 0.14' W). We deployed liquid carbon dioxide in open-topped containers on the sea floor. The carbon dioxide reacted with the carbonate system in the overlying seawater, and carbon dioxide-rich seawater flowed out onto the sediment. We placed inverted funnel traps near the containers and similar to 75 rn away from them. Measurements of pH confirmed that the area near the containers was exposed to carbon dioxide-rich seawater. As a test taxon, we chose harpacticoid copepods. The traps near the source of the carbon dioxide-rich seawater caught significantly more harpacticoids than those far from it. The harpacticoids apparently attempted to escape from the advancing front of carbon dioxide-rich seawater and therefore presumably found exposure to it to be stressful.

TI  - Prospects for carbon capture and storage technologies
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies remove carbon dioxide from flue gases for storage in geologic formations or the ocean. We find that CCS is technically feasible, with current costs of about \$200 to \$250 per ton of carbon. Although currently a relatively expensive mitigation option, CCS could be attractive if we have a stringent carbon policy, if CCS turns out unexpectedly inexpensive relative to other options, or if it is otherwise desired to retain fossil fuels as part of the energy mix while reducing carbon emissions. Near-term prospects favor CCS for electric power plants and certain industrial sources with storage in depleted oil and gas reservoirs as opposed to aquifers. Deep aquifers may provide an attractive longer-term-storage option, whereas ocean storage poses greater technical and environmental uncertainty. CCS should be seriously considered for addressing climate change, alongside energy efficiency and carbon-free energy, although significant environmental, technical, and political uncertainties and obstacles remain.

TI  - Government backs carbon sequestration
AB  - The UK government has announced an investment of Â£40m in climate friendly technologies to store carbon dioxide in depleted North Sea oil and gas wells. The Carbon abatement Strategy is expected to improve the efficiency of low-carbon alternatives. It will also fund for storage and capture of carbon dioxide underground, called sequestration. Capturing CO2 from an onshore location and transporting it offshore for re-injection through existing oil and gas pipelines and installations is a costly process. To carry it out in the North Sea would require significant investment in the new infrastructure both on and offshore.

TI  - Small scale field study of an ocean CO2 plume
AB  - We have carried out a small-scale (similar to20 1) CO2 sequestration experiment off northern California (684 m depth, similar to5degreesC, background ocean PH similar to7.7) designed as an initial investigation of the effects of physical forcing of the fluid, and the problem of sensing the formation of a low PH plume. The buoyant CO2 was contained in a square frame 1.2 m high, exposing 0.21 m 2 to ocean flow. Two PH electrodes attached to the frame recorded the signal; a second frame placed 1.9 m south of the CO2 Pool was also equipped with two recording PH electrodes. An additional PH electrode was held in the ROV robotic arm to probe the fluid interface. Local water velocities of up to 40 cm sec(-1) were encountered, creating significant eddies within the CO2 box, and forcing wavelets at the fluid interface. This resulted in rapid CO2 dissolution, with all CO2 being depleted in a little more than 2 days. The PH record from the sensor closest (similar to10 cm) to the CO2 showed many spikes of low PH water, the extreme value being similar to5.9. The sensor 1 m immediately below this showed no detectable response. The electrodes placed 1.9 m distant from the source also recorded very small perturbations. The results provide important clues for the design of future experiments for CO2 disposal and biogeochemical impact studies. These include the need for dealing with the slow CO2 hydration kinetics, better understanding of the fluid dynamics of the CO2-water interface, and non-point source release designs to provide more constant, controlled local CO2 enrichments within the experimental area.

TI  - Enhancing growth of mangrove seedlings in the environmentally extreme Arabian Gulf using treated sewage sludge
AB  - The response of mangrove (Avicennia marina) seedlings to treated (wet) sludge from a sewage treatment plant (STP) was tested in a randomized block design experiment at a tree nursery on Mubarraz Island in the Arabian Gulf. The growth response of seedlings to half-strength and full-strength STP sludge was monitored over 103 days and compared with the response to freshwater, seawater and half-strength seawater treatments. Sludge treatments resulted in significantly greater plant growth, leaf number, leaf biomass and root biomass than the other treatments did. The positive effect of STP sludge on seedling growth is attributed to enhanced levels of total nitrogen (8.9 +/- 0.1 mg l(-1)) and total phosphorus (7.8 +/- 0.2 mg l(-1)) in the sludge and its low salinity. These results suggest that sludge from sewage treatment plants may be beneficially used in mangrove nurseries and plantations in this arid region, where soils are nutrient-poor and fresh water is scarce.

TI  - THE ABIOTICALLY DRIVEN BIOLOGICAL PUMP IN THE OCEAN AND SHORT-TERM FLUCTUATIONS IN ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONTENTS
AB  - Current debates on the significance of the oceanic `'biological pump'' in the removal of atmospheric CO2 pay more attention to the act of biological carbon-dioxide fixation (primary productivity) in the sea, but pay less or no attention to the equally relevant aspect of the transfer of the fixed carbon to a sink before its oxidation back to CO2. The upper ocean obviously disqualifies as a sink for biologically fixed CO2 because of gas-exchange with the atmosphere. The deep ocean, on the other hand, can be a sink at least at time scales of the ocean turnover. Transfer of newly-fixed CO2 to the deep sea can be accelerated by abiogenic matter introduced to the sea surface from terrestrial sources. This matter acts as ballast and increases the density and settling rates of aggregates of freshly synthesized organic matter thereby facilitating their rapid removal from the upper ocean. Higher supply of abiogenic matter enhances the sequestering of fresh organic matter and in effect shifts the zone of organic matter remineralization from the upper ocean to the deep sea. Consistent with this abiogenic forcing, the rate of organic matter remineralization and the subsequent storage of the remineralized carbon in the deep sea are linked to bulk fluxes (mass accumulation rates) in the deep sea. This mechanism acts as an `'abiotic boost'' in the workings of the oceanic `'biological pump'' and results in an increase in deep sea carbon storage; the magnitude of carbon thus stored could have caused the observed short term fluctuations in atmospheric CO2-contents during the glacial-interglacial cycles.

TI  - Perceptions of sub-seabed carbon dioxide storage in Scotland and implications for policy: A qualitative study
AB  - The geological storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) offers notable potential, as part of larger carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) processes, to be a significant climate change mitigation technology. This paper challenges the argument often put forward that, due to the greater distances from centres of population, it will be 'easier' to garner public and stakeholder support for offshore CO2 storage than onshore. Based on the results of research interviews carried out with stakeholders and informed publics in Scotland, challenges for public and stakeholder acceptance of sub-seabed CO2 storage that may require further policy attention are identified. Whilst existing policy for sub-seabed CO2 storage is cognisant of the need for societal engagement, it may be the case that these regulations may need further reinforcement to ensure future developments are able to address social acceptability issues as fully as possible. The value of taking into account social as well as physical characteristics at the site selection phase, the need for mechanisms to take seriously stakeholder conceptions of uncertainty, and the importance of extending social engagement beyond risk communication are discussed.

TI  - Optimization of biomass production from Chlorella vulgaris by response surface methodology and study of the fatty acid profile for biodiesel production: A green approach
AB  - This study was aimed to utilize Box Behnken Design (BBD) of the response surface methodology, for identifying optimum levels of particular variables for increased biomass production in Chlorella vulgaris. A second-order polynomial model produced satisfactory results in biomass yield (P < 0.0001). The amount of biomass predicted in Response Surface Methodology was 11.165 mg/ml at optimized conditions pH-8.07, temperature-39.5 degrees C, sodium bicarbonate -0.007 mg/ml and urea-0.005 mg/ml. Results of the predicted and the actual response were dif-fering with residuals >2.34\% and R2-98.32 and Adj R2 90.83 for biomass and were found to be in reasonable agreement with the better reliability model. Chlorella vulgaris was cultivated in modi-fied artificial sea nutrient medium (III), supplemented with CO2 under optimized conditions and the lipid was extracted by Soxhlet extractor and the GC-MS analysis of the lipid revealed 35 com-pounds and the lipid after transesterification process revealed 30 compounds following 20 com-pounds of crude glycerol. Transesterification of the lipid produced 86.115\% of biodiesel com-pounds and 92.015\% of crude glycerol when compared to the Soxhlet extractor, which produced 53.56\% of biodiesel compounds.

TI  - Fucoid brown algae inject fucoidan carbon into the ocean
AB  - Brown algae annually convert gigatons of carbon dioxide into carbohydrates, including the complex extracellular matrix polysaccharide fucoidan. Due to its persistence in the environment, fucoidan is potentially a pathway for marine carbon sequestration. Rates of fucoidan secretion by brown algae remain unknown due to the challenge of identifying and quantifying complex polysaccharides in seawater. We adapted the techniques of anion exchange chromatography, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and biocatalytic enzyme-based assay for detection and quantification of fucoidan. We found the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus at the Baltic Sea coast of south-west Finland to secrete 0.3% of their biomass as fucoidan per day. Dissolved fucoidan concentrations in seawater adjacent to algae reached up to 0.48 mg L-1. Fucoidan accumulated during incubations of F. vesiculosus, significantly more in light than in darkness. Maximum estimation by acid hydrolysis indicated fucoidan secretion at a rate of 28 to 40 mg C kg-1 h-1, accounting for 44 to 50% of all exuded dissolved organic carbon. Composed only of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur, fucoidan secretion does not consume nutrients enabling carbon sequestration independent of algal growth. Extrapolated over a year, the algae sequester more carbon into secreted fucoidan than their biomass. The global utility of fucoidan secretion is an alternative pathway for carbon dioxide removal by brown algae without the need to harvest or bury algal biomass. Â© 2022 the Author(s).

TI  - Diversity of ocean acidification effects on marine N-2 fixers
AB  - Considering the important role of N-2 fixation for primary productivity and CO2 sequestration, it is crucial to assess the response of diazotrophs to ocean acidification. Previous studies on the genus Trichodesmium suggested a strong sensitivity towards ocean acidification. In view of the large functional diversity in N-2 fixers, the objective of this study was to improve our knowledge of the CO2 responses of other diazotrophs. To this end, the single-celled Cyanothece sp. and two heterocystous species, Nodularia spumigena and the symbiotic Calothrix rhizosoleniae, were acclimated to two pCO(2) levels (380 vs. 980 mu atm). Growth rates, cellular composition (carbon, nitrogen and chlorophyll a) as well as carbon and N-2 fixation rates (C-14 incorporation, acetylene reduction) were measured and compared to literature data on different N-2 fixers. The three species investigated in this study responded differently to elevated pCO(2), showing enhanced, decreased as well as unaltered growth and production rates. For instance, Cyanothece increased production rates with pCO(2), which is in line with the general view that N-2 fixers benefit from ocean acidification. Due to lowered growth and production of Nodularia, nitrogen input to the Baltic Sea might decrease in the future. In Calothrix, no significant changes in growth or production could be observed, even though N-2 fixation was stimulated under elevated pCO(2). Reviewing literature data confirmed a large variability in CO2 sensitivity across diazotrophs. The contrasting response patterns in our and previous studies were discussed with regard to the carbonate chemistry in the respective natural habitats, the mode of N-2 fixation as well as differences in cellular energy limitation between the species. The group-specific CO2 sensitivities will impact differently on future biogeochemical cycles of open-ocean environments and systems like the Baltic Sea and should therefore be considered in models estimating climate feedback effects.

TI  - Effects of land use intensity on the full greenhouse gas balance in an Atlantic peat bog
AB  - Wetlands can either be net sinks or net sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs), depending on the mean annual water level and other factors like average annual temperature, vegetation development, and land use. Whereas drained and agriculturally used peatlands tend to be carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) sources but methane (CH4) sinks, restored (i.e. rewetted) peatlands rather incorporate CO2, tend to be N2O neutral and release CH4. One of the aims of peatland restoration is to decrease their global warming potential (GWP) by reducing GHG emissions. We estimated the greenhouse gas exchange of a peat bog restoration sequence over a period of 2 yr (1 July 2007-30 June 2009) in an Atlantic raised bog in northwest Germany. We set up three study sites representing different land use intensities: intensive grassland (deeply drained, mineral fertilizer, cattle manure and 4-5 cuts per year); extensive grassland (rewetted, no fertilizer or manure, up to 1 cutting per year); near-natural peat bog (almost no anthropogenic influence). Daily and annual greenhouse gas exchange was estimated based on closed-chamber measurements. CH4 and N2O fluxes were recorded bi-weekly, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) measurements were carried out every 3-4 weeks. Annual sums of CH4 and N2O fluxes were estimated by linear interpolation while NEE was modelled. Regarding GWP, the intensive grassland site emitted 564 Â± 255 g CO2-C equivalents m-2 yr-1 and 850 Â± 238 g CO2-C equivalents m-2 yr-1 in the first (2007/2008) and the second (2008/2009) measuring year, respectively. The GWP of the extensive grassland amounted to-129 Â± 231 g CO2-C equivalents m -2 yr-1 and 94 Â± 200 g CO2-C equivalents m-2 yr-1, while it added up to 45 Â± 117 g CO 2-C equivalents m-2 yr-1 and-101 Â± 93 g CO2-C equivalents m-2 yr-1 in 2007/08 and 2008/09 for the near-natural site. In contrast, in calendar year 2008 GWP aggregated to 441 Â± 201 g CO2-C equivalents m-2 yr-1, 14 Â± 162 g CO2-C equivalents m-2 yr-1 and 31 Â± 75 g CO2-C equivalents m-2 yr-1 for the intensive grassland, extensive grassland, and near-natural site, respectively. Despite inter-annual variability, rewetting contributes considerably to mitigating GHG emission from formerly drained peatlands. Extensively used grassland on moderately drained peat approaches the carbon sequestration potential of near-natural sites, although it may oscillate between being a small sink and being a small source depending on inter-annual climatic variability.

TI  - Lethal effects on different marine organisms, associated with sediment-seawater acidification deriving from CO2 leakage
AB  - CO2 leakages during carbon capture and storage in sub-seabed geological structures could produce potential impacts on the marine environment. To study lethal effects on marine organisms attributable to CO2 seawater acidification, a bubbling CO2 system was designed enabling a battery of different tests to be conducted, under laboratory conditions, employing various pH treatments (8. 0, 7. 5, 7. 0, 6. 5, 6. 0, and 5. 5). Assays were performed of three exposure routes (seawater, whole sediment, and sediment elutriate). Individuals of the clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) and early-life stages of the gilthead seabream, Sparus aurata, were exposed for 10 days and 72 h, respectively, to acidified clean seawater. S. aurata larvae were also exposed to acidified elutriate samples, and polychaete organisms of the specie Hediste diversicolor and clams R. philippinarum were also exposed for 10 days to estuarine whole sediment. In the fish larvae elutriate test, 100 % mortality was recorded at pH 6. 0, after 48 h of exposure. Similar results were obtained in the clam sediment exposure test. In the other organisms, significant mortality (p &lt; 0.05) was observed at pH values lower than 6. 0. Very high lethal effects (calculating L[H+]50, defined as the H+ concentration that causes lethal effects in 50 % of the population exposed) were detected in association with the lowest pH treatment for all the species. The implication of these results is that a severe decrease of seawater pH would cause high mortality in marine organisms of several different kinds and life stages. The study addresses the potential risks incurred due to CO2 leakages in marine environments. Â© 2012 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Microbial enrichment and meta-omics analysis identify CAZymes from mangrove sediments with unique properties
AB  - Although lignocellulose is the most abundant and renewable natural resource for biofuel production, its use remains under exploration because of its highly recalcitrant structure. Its deconstruction into sugar monomers is mainly driven by carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). To develop highly efficient and fast strategies to discover biomass-degrading enzymes for biorefinery applications, an enrichment process combined with integrative omics approaches was used to identify new CAZymes. The lignocellulolytic-enriched mangrove microbial community (LignoManG) established on sugarcane bagasse (SB) was enriched with lignocellulolytic bacteria and fungi such as Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Basidiomycota, and Ascomycota. These microbial communities were able to degrade up to 55 \% of the total SB, indicating the production of lignocellulolytic enzymes. Metagenomic analysis revealed that the LignoManG harbors 18.042 CAZyme sequences such as of cellulases, hemicellulases, carbohydrate esterases, and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase. Similarly, our metaproteomic analysis depicted several enzymes from distinct families of different CAZy families. Based on the LignoManG data, a xylanase (coldXynZ) was selected, amplified, cloned, expressed, and biochemically characterized. The enzyme displayed psicrofilic properties, with the highest activity at 15 degrees C, retaining 77 \% of its activity when incubated at 0 degrees C. Moreover, molecular modeling in silico indicated that coldXynZ is composed of a TIM barrel, which is a typical folding found in the GH10 family, and displayed similar structural features related to cold-adapted enzymes. Collectively, the data generated in this study represent a valuable resource for lignocellulolytic enzymes with potential biotechnological applications.

TI  - Consequences of a simulated rapid ocean acidification event for benthic ecosystem processes and functions
AB  - Whilst the biological consequences of long-term, gradual changes in acidity associated with the oceanic uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) are increasingly studied, the potential effects of rapid acidification associated with a failure of sub-seabed carbon storage infrastructure have received less attention. This study investigates the effects of severe short-term (8days) exposure to acidified seawater on infaunal mediation of ecosystem processes (bioirrigation and sediment particle redistribution) and functioning (nutrient concentrations). Following acidification, individuals of Amphiura filiformis exhibited emergent behaviour typical of a stress response, which resulted in altered bioturbation, but limited changes in nutrient cycling. Under acidified conditions, A. filiformis moved to shallower depths within the sediment and the variability in occupancy depth reduced considerably. This study indicated that rapid acidification events may not be lethal to benthic invertebrates, but may result in behavioural changes that could have longer-term implications for species survival, ecosystem structure and functioning.

TI  - Vegetation and carbon stock analysis of mangrove ecosystem in Pancer Cengkrong, Trenggalek, East Java, Indonesia
AB  - Research has been conducted in March to July 2013 in the Mangrove Ecosystem Pancer Cengkrong, Trenggalek, East Java, Indonesia. The objective was to obtain composition of mangrove vegetation and potential carbon stocks. There were three stations for composition of vegetation analysis. Potential carbon stock was calculated by allometric equations. The total of 26 species were identified (17 true mangroves and 9 association mangroves). The vegetation dominated by Sonneratia alba with an average density of 596 trees/ha, followed by Rhizophora apiculata (221 trees/ha) and Avicennia alba (149 trees/ha). The Saplings and seedlings dominated by Ceriops tagal (with average density of 1,745 Saplings/ha; 34,745 seedlings/ha). More than 75 % stand structure of mangrove have tree diameter of 4-9.9 cm. Total biomass and carbon stocks were 400.45 ton/ha and 185.81 ton/ha (equivalent to the total amount of CO2 uptake by 681.91 ton/ha). Sonneratia alba was tree that contribute the largest carbon storage. Â© 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Carbon capture, utilization, and storage hub development on the Gulf Coast
AB  - The Gulf Coast of the United States hosts diverse power generation, refining, and petrochemical processing facilities, resulting in the nation's largest volumetric concentration of industrial CO2 emissions, rivaled only by the Ohio River Valley. These emissions sources are concentrated in specific industrial clusters that allow combining emissions streams to achieve economies of scale. The region is currently undergoing globally significant industrial expansion and investment as a result of abundant and inexpensive regional unconventional natural gas availability, and is a growing exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Opportunities to integrate CO2 emission management within the diverse energy chains in the region are volumetrically significant and include both concentrated and dilute sources. Significant examples of capture, transport, and storage exist. Offshore storage is particularly attractive, as it provides simplified land leasing models (single governmental land owner), proven reservoir quality, and presents fewer risks to both protected groundwater and populated areas. Projects can now take advantage of recently expanded opportunities under section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Service tax code. The region continues to evolve as an active carbon-handling hub, and is uniquely suited to justify additional investment in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies via a large-scale integrated project development. Continued development of integrated projects will allow the region to continue to grow economically within its strong fossil-fuel handling competence focus while advancing low-carbon energy technologies that maintain globally competitiveness.

TI  - Influence of patch size on hydrodynamic flow in submerged aquatic vegetation
AB  - Blue carbon, or carbon dioxide captured and stored by submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in ecosystems, has been attracting attention as a measure to mitigate climate change. Since the scale of SAV meadows is smaller than that of topography length scale, with the former often occurring in patches, the flexibilities of SAV motion induce complicated interactions with water flows and make it difficult to estimate carbon sequestration rates. Therefore, this study aims to clarify the influences of SAV patches on water flows and mass transport using laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. An SAV model was successfully applied to analyze the results of laboratory experiments, revealing good agreement and showing that the size of an SAV patch significantly affects the water flows. The extent to which the patch occupies the channel width was revealed to be the most substantial factor in controlling carbon absorption by SAV, and deflection was found to be another significant factor. Implementing global warming countermeasures is a critical goal of climate change mitigation, so our study outcome is expected to be helpful for improving and promoting blue carbon as a negative emission strategy.

TI  - Climate change vis-a-vis saline agriculture: Impact and adaptation strategies
AB  - During the last two decades, the world has recognized that the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases (GHGs), namely, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), have increased markedly as a result of human activities. During pre-industrial era (1750 AD), their concentrations were 280 ppm, 715 ppb and 270 ppb, respectively, and these values have increased to 385 ppm, 1797 ppb and 322 ppb, respectively, in 2008. Increase in atmospheric CO2 promotes growth and productivity of plants with C3 photosynthetic pathway, but the increase in temperature, on the other hand, can reduce crop duration, increase crop respiration rates, affect the survival and distribution of pest populations and may hasten nutrient mineralization in soil, decrease fertilizer use efficiency and increase evapotranspiration and soil salinity. The water resources which are already scarce may come under enhanced stress. In the scenario of sea-level rise due to climate change, the inundated area with sea water will increase influencing the crop production due to higher salinity. Thus, the impact of climate change is likely to have a significant influence on agriculture and eventually on the food security and livelihoods of a large section of the rural population. There are evidences of negative impacts on yield of crops with variable magnitude in diverse ecologies including soil salinity and waterlogging particularly in the developing countries. Adaptation strategies and mitigation through perennial cropping systems such as agroforestry can be the main approach in handling climate change and salinity-related problems. Upscaling of modern technologies such as conservation and smart agriculture, judicious utilization of available water (including poorquality water) for agriculture through micro-irrigation and water-saving technologies, developing multiple stress-tolerant crops through molecular biological tools, restoration of degraded soils and waters, promoting carbon sequestration preferably through efficient agroforestry practices and conservation of biodiversity should be promoted at regional and country level. We need to formulate both short-term and long-term policies for improvement, sustenance and protection of natural resources. There is a need of capacity building and international collaboration in developing database for efficient weather forecasting and handling salinity-related problems and preparing contingency plans for vulnerable areas. The objectives of this paper are to summarize the information available on the mitigation options and adaptation strategies for climate change and rehabilitation of saline and waterlogged habitats to meet the food security especially in India.

TI  - CO2 direct utilization technology for economic development of high CO2 gas field: A technology assessment study
AB  - Permanent abatement of CO2 has become a major challenge in many gas field developments especially within this South-East Asia region. Among the challenges are on how to dispose or utilize this huge amount anthropogenic CO2 safely and economically. Therefore, the objective of this study is to identify the best technology for non-catalytic CO2 Direct utilization to manage and support economic development of high CO2 gas field in Malaysia. A Market survey was conducted to a few shortlisted technologies to assess on the technology landscape and the market potential. The feedback was analyzed based on the criteria established on the basis of company requirement. From the study, 'Mineral Carbonation' has been identified as one of the potential technology solution for permanent sequestration of CO2 in Malaysia. The future of this technology application is very promising due to the availability of the local feedstock, mineral waste and the potential market of this product especially for carbonate product such as precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC). However, this technology still possesses some technical challenges due to slow kinetic reaction. For a large scale application, this will become more demanding especially in terms of footprint as the current technology is mainly on batch process. Therefore, the current R&amp;D should look into area where this process kinetic can be improved and to look into continuous or semi-continuous process for smaller footprint.

TI  - Numerical simulation of biological impact caused by direct injection of carbon dioxide in the ocean
AB  - The direct injection of CO2 in the deep ocean is a promising way to mitigate global warming. One of the uncertainties in this method, however, is its impact on marine organisms in the near field before CO2 is diluted widely in the ocean. Since field experiments cost enormously, computational simulations are expected to show detailed information on the dilution process near injection points and its impact on marine organisms. In general, the LC50 concept is widely applied for testing the acute impact of a toxic agent on organisms. As a biological impact model we therefore consider mortality, which reflects recent laboratory experiments on zooplankton at various concentrations of CO2. Here we regard the sigmoid -transformed mortality as a linear function of time in the logarithmic scale, and not just of the concentration of CO2 in the logarithmic scale. This model was installed in a computational simulation code for the reconstruction of small-scale ocean turbulence. The results suggest that the biological effect is not significant when the ship speed is 4 knots and CO2 is injected at 0.1 ton/see in the form of a spray through 100 nozzles provided vertically on a pipe at 10 m intervals. It is therefore considered that the moving-ship method is effective for direct CO2 injection.

TI  - Review of CO2-CH4 clathrate hydrate replacement reaction laboratory studies - Properties and kinetics
AB  - Replacement reactions in clathrate hydrates, for which CO2 is used to replace methane gas trapped in inclusion compounds in the deep sea or permafrost areas, have gained growing attention as a possible method to sequester CO2 and recover natural gas. This review examines research progress in the replacement reactions and analytical methods with special focus on laboratory studies. Methane hydrate dissociation enthalpies, carbon dioxide hydrate dissociation enthalpies, methane hydrate thermal conductivities and thermal diffusivities are tabulated. Methods used to study the CH4-CO2 replacement reaction include material balance (MB), MB with particle size analyzer, MB and Raman, NMR, and magnetic resonance imaging. New analytical methods such as thermo-Raman should be explored in the future to develop a localized picture of the microscopic replacement mechanism including water molecule movement. Combination of these data with molecular simulations will allow new macroscopic models to be developed for use with practical processes for unconventional natural gas.

TI  - Towards carbon neutrality: How much do forest carbon sinks cost in China?
AB  - With the implementation of carbon neutrality strategies in China, both carbon emissions reduction and carbon sequestration should be considered. In order to exert the carbon neutrality potential of forest carbon sinks, it is necessary to calculate the cost of them in China. Based on the basic principles of land use opportunity cost and net present value from previous research, this paper constructs a forest carbon sink cost estimation model based on the afforestation cost method. Empirical analysis of the carbon sequestration cost is explored at the city level in China. According to the results, the regional distribution of carbon sink costs varies greatly. On the whole, Southwest China is suitable for afforestation to create carbon sinks since its cost is relatively low. It can obtain carbon benefits from forest carbon sinks projects, while there are higher carbon sink costs in the eastern coastal areas. Furthermore, it dynamically analyzes the impact of the rotation period, timber price, discount rate and afforestation cost on the cost of carbon sinks. The rotation period and afforestation cost have more sensitivity for the forest carbon sink cost. Therefore, it should implement different low-carbon policies in different regions, and encourage forest management to create carbon sinks in areas rich in forest resources. In addition, an inter-regional carbon sink trading mechanism can play the economic value of forest carbon sinks effectively and achieve win-win cooperation between regions. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Comment on ``Increasing Rates of Carbon Burial in Southwest Florida Coastal Wetlands{''} by J. Breithaupt et al.
AB  - In a recent study, Breithaupt et al. (2020); contend observed rates of sediment and organic carbon accumulation in Southwest Florida coastal wetlands have increased in response to an acceleration in the rate of sea-level. This, it is argued, implies the wetlands are more resilient to future sea-level rise than previously thought and under conditions of continued acceleration, even more organic carbon will be stored. However, upon closer inspection, the study conclusions are flawed as they are based upon an inappropriate methodological approach to quantifying sediment and organic carbon accumulation rates and require an acceleration in the rate of historical (decades) sea-level rise of which there is limited evidence and no broad consensus. Plain Language Summary Coastal plant communities accumulate organic carbon at different rates and therefore spatial changes in their distribution induced by sea-level rise are accompanied by changing patterns of organic carbon accumulation and storage. As a substantial element of the ecological and biogeochemical landscape, understanding how coastal wetlands respond to future sea-level rise is critical to forecasting their resilience and capacity to function as a blue carbon ecosystem. In a recent study, Breithaupt et al. (2020); https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JG005349 contend the coastal wetlands of Southwest Florida will continue to function and sequester ever-more carbon under future conditions of accelerating sea-level rise. However, study conclusions are based upon an inappropriate methodological approach to quantify sediment and organic accumulation rates and require an acceleration in the rate of historical (decades) sea-level rise of which there is limited evidence and no broad consensus.

TI  - Mapping mangrove alliances using historical data in Fiji
AB  - The mapping of mangrove alliance distributions is limited because of lack of training data and inaccessibility of sites. Mapping mangrove alliances is important for monitoring carbon storage as well as socio-economic services to local communities. This research uses alliance field data from 1978 along with current mangrove distribution for Rewa River Delta and Suva-Navua coast in Fiji to train a Random Forest model. Classification of mangrove alliances used Sentinel-1 and - 2 images along with elevation data which resulted in a 94\% classification accuracy for Rewa River Delta and 74.5\% Suva-Navua. Alliances within the Rewa River Delta, including Mixed, Dogo, Boreti, Landward and Tiri, were classified with greater than 85\% accuracy. In comparison, most alliances in the Suva-Navua had less than 67\% accuracy; the exception was Coastal Fringing alliance which represents 56\% of the area and had a 92\% classification accuracy. White and red mangroves were better classified when they had larger area coverage. The Random Forest model identified SWIR, NIR and elevation data as the most important variables for discriminating mangrove alliances. Compared to limited other studies that mapped mangrove alliances using optical data alone, this analysis resulted in equal or better classification results. These results show the potential of using historic data for mapping contemporary mangrove alliances in regions that often have limited validation data or accessibility. The next step is mapping recovery of mangrove alliances post-cyclone events to help conservation groups identify focused mitigation efforts.

TI  - Protecting ocean carbon through biodiversity and climate governance
AB  - Global policy goals for halting biodiversity loss and climate change depend on each other to be successful. Marine biodiversity and climate change are intertwined through foodwebs that cycle and transport carbon and contribute to carbon sequestration. Yet, biodiversity conservation and fisheries management seldom explicitly include ocean carbon transport and sequestration. In order to effectively manage and govern human activities that affect carbon cycling and sequestration, international biodiversity and climate agreements need to address both biodiversity and climate issues. International agreements that address issues for climate and biodiversity are best poised to facilitate the protection of ocean carbon with existing policies. The degree to which the main international biodiversity and climate agreements make reference to multiple issues has however not been documented. Here, we used a text mining analysis of over 2,700 binding and non-binding policy documents from ten global ocean-related agreements to identify keywords related to biodiversity, climate, and ocean carbon. While climate references were mostly siloed within climate agreements, biodiversity references were included in most agreements. Further, we found that six percent of policy documents (n=166) included ocean carbon keywords. In light of our results, we highlight opportunities to strengthen the protection of ocean carbon in upcoming negotiations of international agreements, and via area-based management, environmental impact assessment and strategic environmental assessment.

TI  - Influence of ocean CO2 sequestration on bacterial production
AB  - Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a major greenhouse gas. Increasing atmospheric concentrations are believed to be responsible for a gradual warming of the Earth. Strategies to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere by sequestration underground or in the deep ocean are being investigated. An international collaboration to conduct a field experiment on CO2 ocean sequestration was initiated in December 1997. The primary objective of this project is to obtain data that can be applied to assess environmental impacts of direct injection of CO2 into the deep ocean. The collaboration is being implemented by a research team comprising engineers and scientists from five nations: Japan, the US, Norway, Canada, and Australia. This paper focuses on studies being conducted as part of the field experiment to investigate the influence of decreased seawater pH from CO2 dissolution on bacterial production in the ocean. A preliminary analysis of the variation in bacterial production under different values of pH and temperature, conducted in July 1999, indicated that there was no measurable effect on the microbial population in the first 24 h of the experiment. However, there was a rapid decline in bacterial production with decreases in pH over a 96 h incubation period. In addition, the impact of reduced pH was more pronounced when the bacteria were grown at warmer temperatures, i.e. with a more rapid potential production rate. Subsequent laboratory experiments were conducted in June 2000 using pressure chambers to determine the effect of depressurization on bacterial production. For this effort, seawater samples were collected from a 600 m deep pipeline off the Kona coast of the island of Hawaii. Water was placed in a pressure chamber and allowed to stabilize for 48 h at the ambient pressure and temperature of 600 m depth at the sampling location. After 48 h, the water was depressurized and acidified with CO2 to pH values of 6.95 and 5.6. The acidified water and an un-amended sample were incubated at 5, 10 and 15 Â°C for 96 h and sampled every 24 h. Similar impacts to those observed previously on the bacterial production were noted. The overall result was that longer incubation times and warmer temperatures reduced bacterial production in samples exposed to the lower pH. This observation is beneficial to develop an understanding of the long term effects of CO2 releases on basic elemental cycles that support aquatic food chains. Future work needs to investigate long term variation in the bacterial community, the impact on nutrient recycling, and the population growth efficiency. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Acidification in Arabian Gulf - Insights from pH and temperature measurements
AB  - The detrimental effects of increasing atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases since the industrial revolution has led to a concerted international effort to control their release and abate the environmental and human health impacts. CO2 is removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis of plants in the terrestrial environment and by aquatic sequestration. In the Middle East and other arid countries, terrestrial removal is minimal. The most likely removal pathway for CO2 in arid regions around the world is by aquatic sequestration. In the Middle East the major sink is the Arabian Gulf which leads to acidification of the marine environment. Biweekly pH concentration measurements in surface waters of the northern Arabian Gulf over a four year period in this study suggest that the Arabian Gulf waters are becoming increasingly acidic with time. Supporting evidence for increased CO2 sequestration comes from increased marine primary productivity over the past decade. Biological effects, such as coral bleaching, observed during this period suggest that urgent action is required to reverse the trend and protect marine life. The data highlight the fact that this semi-enclosed sea is undergoing a rapid degradation which may affect the oceanic chemistry and biogeochemical cycle much earlier than predicted for most oceanic waters.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration via Direct Injection into the Ocean
AB  - One method to reduce the buildup of atmospheric greenhouse gasses is to capture carbon dioxide from large stationary sources and inject it to the ocean. This would accelerate the slow, natural process by which most of the carbon dioxide we currently release to the atmosphere ultimately enters the ocean, thus reducing both peak atmospheric CO2 concentrations and their rate of increase. On the order of 1000 gigaton (Gt) of CO2 could theoretically be injected, without causing perturbations to ocean chemistry significantly greater than the spatial and temporal changes that have been observed due to natural variation. Ocean general circulation models suggest that the injected CO2 could remain sequestered for several hundred years. A number of discharge scenarios are possible, with their aim being either to isolate the CO2 from the environment, or maximize mixing, and thus minimize marine impacts associated with increased CO2 concentration or decreased pH near the injection site. While many theoretical and laboratory studies support the potential viability of direct injection, field experiments are necessary to validate the concept. To date, these research efforts have been hampered by public opinion which reacts cautiously to actions which could be perceived to jeopardize the ocean environment.

TI  - Simulated sequestration of industrial carbon dioxide at a deep-sea site: Effects on species of harpacticoid copepods
AB  - One proposal for alleviating global warming is to sequester large amounts of industrial carbon dioxide on the deep-sea floor, but the environmental consequences of sequestration for the animals living in the sediment are poorly known. In an earlier publication, we reported that, during an experimental sequestration off central California (36.378 degrees N, 122.676 degrees NN 3262 m depth), most individuals of our target taxon (the harpacticoid copepods) were killed, but similar to 20\% survived. Because knowledge of which species survived and how they did so could clarify the effects of sequestration on the fauna, we have now identified the individuals from that experiment to species. Although most were adversely affected, species differed significantly in the degree of their susceptibility. Unexpectedly, six species showed no effect and may be resistant. The hypothesis that harpacticoids could escape the effects of carbon dioxide-rich seawater by moving deeper into the seabed was not supported. Exposure to carbon dioxide-rich seawater created partially defaunated areas, but we found no evidence that disturbance-exploiting harpacticoid species invaded during the recovery of the affected area. Because the environmental effects of the carbon dioxide (e.g. unusually acidic pore water) were still present, however, the opportunity for invasion might not yet have occurred. Differences among species in susceptibility increase the complexity of the effects of carbon dioxide sequestration on the deep-sea fauna. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Experimental study on solution and diffusion process of carbon dioxide bubble in seawater
AB  - The increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is one of the causes of greenhouse effect. In order to control the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, the technology of recovering the emitted CO2 and isolating from the atmosphere is considered to be effective. In this viewpoint, the solution and diffusion process of CO2 in seawater is important in the research and development of CO2 ocean sequestration technology to mitigate global warming. In this study, solution process of CO2 bubble in seawater and pure water were experimentally studied under various pressures, temperatures, and initial bubble diameters to evaluate the transport process of CO2 in seawater. Experimental conditions for the temperature ranged from 278 K to 293 K, and the pressure ranged from around 1 atm up to 4 atm. It was obtained that the complete solution time decreases with the increase in pressure due to its higher solubility at a higher pressure. It decreases with an increase in temperature arising from a higher diffusivity at a higher temperature. It was clarified that the complete solution time for CO2 in seawater is higher than that in pure water due to its relatively lower solubility compared with pure water.

TI  - Provenance and Sediment Maturity as Controls on CO2 Mineral Sequestration Potential of the Gassum Formation in the Skagerrak
AB  - In order to meet the increasing demand to decarbonize the atmosphere, storage of CO2 in subsurface geological reservoirs is an effective measure. To maximize storage capacity, various types of saline aquifers should be considered including dynamic storage options with open or semi-open boundaries. In sloping aquifers, assessment of the immobilization potential for CO2 through dissolution and mineralization along the flow path is a crucial part of risk evaluations. The Gassum Formation in the Skagerrak is considered a nearshore CO2 storage option with sloping layers, facilitating buoyant migration of CO2 northwards along depositional and structural dip. In this study, petrographic data and provenance analysis provide the basis for estimating reactivity of the sandstones. Immobilization of CO2 in the reservoir through fluid dissolution and mineral reactions reduces risk of leakage. Petrographic analyses are integrated with seismic and well-log interpretation to identify sedimentary facies and to estimate mineral distribution with corresponding reactivity in the proposed injection area. Here the Gassum Formation comprises south-prograding, shoreface-fluvial para-sequences, sourced from northern hinterlands. Pronounced differences in the mineralogical maturity in the studied area are identified and explained by the sediment transport distances and the type of sediment source. This is possible because the U-Pb ages of zircon grains in the sediments can be used to pinpoint the areas where they originate from in the Fennoscandian Shield, such as the Telemarkia or Idefjorden terranes. Albite and Fe-rich chlorite are identified as the most reactive mineral phases in the Gassum sand, of which feldspar comprises the largest weight fraction and the grain-coating chlorite has largest surface area. Their distribution is partly controlled by provenance, so their abundance decreases basinwards with increasing sediment maturity. The abundance of fluvial sandstones presumably increases northwards in basal parts of para-sequences, while shoreface sandstones comprise the top part of sandy units. CO2 injected in the proposed area will migrate upwards within the reservoir, toward higher proportions of Telemarkian-derived sediment and up-dip along the seal, toward more immature sediments. Thus, the reactivity of sediments increases in younger deposits and up depositional dip, while kinetic reaction rates will decrease in shallower, lower temperature regions. Identifying these parameters is important to estimate the CO2 mineral sequestration potential as a function of sedimentary facies and ensure safe storage of CO2. This approach can advantageously be applied to all reservoirs considered for CO2 injection to improve the estimation of the possible CO2 storage volume by taking the provenance dependence of the mineralization potential into account.

TI  - Dissolved organic matter and nutrient dynamics of a coastal freshwater forested wetland in Winyah Bay, South Carolina
AB  - Seasonally flooded, freshwater cypress-tupelo wetlands, dominated by baldcypress (Taxodium distictum), water tupelo (Nyssaaquatica), and swamp tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica var. biflora) are commonly found in coastal regions of the southeastern United States. These wetlands are threatened due to climate change, sea level rise, and coastal urban development. Understanding the natural biogeochemical cycles of nutrients in these forested wetlands as ecosystems services such as carbon sequestration and nitrogen processing can provide important benchmarks to guide conservation plans and restoration goals. In this study, surface water and soil pore water samples were collected weekly from a cypress-tupelo wetland near Winyah Bay, South Carolina and analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), inorganic nitrogen, and phosphate during its flooding period between October 2010 and May 2011. DOC was further characterized by specific ultra-violet absorbance at 254 nm, spectral slope ratio (SR) (ratio of two spectral slopes between 275-295 nm and 350-400 nm), E2/E3 ratio (ratio between A254 and A365), and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix. In addition, litterfall was collected on a monthly basis for a year while the biomass of the detritus layer (i. e., decomposed duff lying on the wetland floor) was determined before and after the flooding period. Results of the field study showed that concentrations of DOC, DON, NH4+-N, and (NO2- + NO3-)-N in the surface water were generally higher during the fall, or peak litterfall season (October to December), than in the spring season (March to May). Highest concentrations of 54. 8, 1. 48, 0. 270, and 0. 0205 mg L-1, for DOC, DON, NH4+-N, and (NO2- + NO3-)-N respectively, in surface waters were recorded during October. Lower SUVA, but higher SR and E2/E3 ratios of DOC, were observed at the end of the flooding season comparing to the initial flooding, suggesting the wetland system converts high aromatic and large DOC molecules into smaller and hydrophilic fractions possibly through photochemical oxidation. A similar trend was observed in soil pore water, but the pore water generally had greater and relatively stable concentrations of dissolved nutrients than surface water. No obvious temporal trend in phosphate concentration and total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratio (N:P) were found. Results of the laboratory extraction and mass balance calculation suggested fresh litter was a major source of DOC whereas decomposed duff was the source of dissolved nitrogen in surface water. In summary, the biogeochemistry of this isolated cypress-tupelo wetland is not only driven by the vegetation within the wetland system but also by hydrology and weather conditions such as groundwater table position, precipitation, and temperature.

TI  - Design of foam-assisted carbon dioxide storage in a North Sea aquifer using streamline-based simulation
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) - the collection of CO2 from industrial sources and its injection underground - could potentially contribute to the reduction of atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gases. In this paper, we investigate the sequestration of CO2 in aquifers with the co-injection of surfactants for foam generation. This is equivalent to the use of foam for conformance control in enhanced oil recovery applications. To study foam-assisted sequestration, we extend an in-house streamline-based simulator to model foam flow. We use two foam models that have been previously suggested in the literature. In both models foam hinders gas mobility through increasing its apparent viscosity. The modified simulator is validated by comparison to analytical solutions. We then investigate the performance of CO2 sequestration with the co-injection of surfactants. We look at CO2 sequestration in a North Sea aquifer. We study both simultaneous and alternating surfactant-gas injection at different fractional flows (i.e. water:gas ratios). For cases where a seal provides a reliable trapping mechanism, the simulation results suggest that the use of surfactants to generate foam significantly improves the storage efficiency at a marginal increase in water consumption. In this setting, CO2/surfactant simultaneous injection at a 0.5 CO2 fractional flow was found to be the optimum injection strategy for the case investigated. To the contrary, if the seal is unreliable or not present at the first place, CO2/brine simultaneous injection at a 0.85 CO2 fractional flow was found to be the optimum injection strategy. Although foam-assisted sequestration in this case further improves the storage efficiency, it does that at a significant increase in water consumption. This is since, although foam generation improves the sweep during the sequestration phase, it significantly hinders the sweep during the chase-brine injection phase. Based on that, having a design where the surfactant will degrade just before or during the chase-brine injection phase would provide the optimum sequestration strategy-without reliance on the presence or integrity of the seal.

TI  - Ocean storage of CO2
AB  - One method for minimizing climate change is to capture CO2 from power plants and inject it into the deep ocean, thus reducing the magnitude and rate of change of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and the surface ocean. Many discharge options are possible, with varied mixing and retention characteristics. The ocean's capacity is vast, and mathematical models suggest that injected CO2 could remain sequestered for several hundred years. While theoretical and laboratory studies support the viability of ocean storage, field experiments are necessary to realistically evaluate the environmental impact.

TI  - An integrated model for CO2 hydrate formation in sand sediments for sub-seabed CO2 storage
AB  - CO2 capture and storage has been considered to be one of the most effective strategies against global warming, among which CO2 storage in deep saline aquifers using the sealing effect of gas hydrate and CO2 storage in the sub-seabed sand sediment in the form of gas hydrate are of great interest nowadays, due to the large capacity of CO2 storage in sub-seabed sand sediments and low risk of CO2 leakage. To access those two options, an integrated model for CO2 hydrate formation, which includes hydrate formation rates on the gas front, on the hydrate film behind the gas front, and on the surface of the sand particles behind the gas front, is proposed in this study to predict hydrate formation morphologies in the sand sediment under the condition of gas-liquid two-phase flow. Then, numerical simulations of CO2 hydrate formation in the sand sediment are conducted, and unknown parameters in the models are determined by comparing the simulation results with experimental data. The simulation results indicate that CO2 hydrate formation on the hydrate film behind the gas front makes a great contribution to CO2 hydrate saturation near the boundary, occupies the pore space of the sand sediment, and results in the permeability reduction and the blockage of the gas flow.

TI  - Simulating seismic chimney structures as potential vertical migration pathways for CO2 in the SnÃ¸hvit area, SW Barents Sea: model challenges and outcomes
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) activities at the SnÃ¸hvit field, Barents Sea, will involve carrying out an analysis to determine which parameters affect the migration process of CO2 from the gas reservoir, to what degree they do so and how sensitive these parameters are to any changes. This analysis will aim to evaluate the effects of applying a broad but realistic range of reservoir, fault and gas chimney properties on potential CO2 leakage at various depths throughout the subsurface. Fluid flow might take place through parts of or the entire extent of the overburden. One of the aims of the analysis is assessing the potential of CO2 reaching the seabed. Using the SnÃ¸hvit gas reservoir and overburden in the Barents Sea, a series of geological models were built using seismic and well-log data. We then performed numerical simulations of CO2 migration in focused fluid flow structures. Identification of potential migration pathways and their extent, such as gas chimneys and faults, and their incorporation into these models and simulations will provide a realistic insight into the migration potential of CO2. In the simulations the CO2 is injected over a 20Â year period at a rate of 0.7Â Mt/year and migration is allowed to take place over a 2000Â year time frame for domains of approximately 21Â km2 for the caprock fault models, 24Â km2 for the realistic gas chimney models and 35Â km2 for the generic gas chimney models, in a layered sedimentary succession. The total mass of CO2 injected in the reservoir during the 20-year injection period is 14 Mt. There is a strong interaction between the various parameters but the parameter that had the most influence on the CO2 migration process was probably the permeability of the reservoirs, especially the average permeability (k). Also, for the faulted caprock scenarios, it should be noted that at near surface depths the permeability of 765 mD is already adequate for a good CO2 flow. At the chimney top level (600Â m) however, a further increase in permeability has an additional effect on improving CO2 flow. Overall, considering the slow upward migration velocity of the plume, this geological setup can be regarded as a suitable storage site. Â© 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - An Analysis of the Climate Change Mitigation Potential through Soil Organic Carbon Sequestration in a Corn Belt Watershed
AB  - Land-based carbon sequestration constitutes a major low cost and immediately viable option in climate change mitigation. Using downscaled data from eight atmosphere-ocean general circulation models for a simulation period between 2015 and 2099, we examine the carbon sequestration potential of alternative agricultural land uses in an intensively farmed Corn Belt watershed and the impact of climate change on crop yields. Our results show that switching from conventional tillage continuous corn to no-till corn-soybean can sequester the equivalent of 192.1 MtCO2 eq of soil organic carbon per hectare with a sequestration rate of 2.26 MtCO2 eq haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1. Our results also indicate that switchgrass can sequester the equivalent of 310.7 MtCO2 eq of soil organic carbon per hectare with a sequestration rate of 3.65 MtCO2 eq haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1. Our findings suggest that, unlike for corn and soybean yields, climate change does not have a significant effect on switchgrass yields, possibly due to the carbon fertilization effect.
