TI  - A comprehensive review on microalgal harvesting strategies: Current status and future prospects
AB  - Microalgae are considered as a potential and sustainable feedstock for the production of biofuels, fine chemicals, nutraceuticals, and cosmetics. This is accredited to their high lipid and carbohydrate content, fast growth and rapid CO2 sequestration ability. However, large volumes of feedstock are required to extract and process biochemicals from microalgal biomass due to the small biomass to liquid ratio. This produces substantial challenges in attaining a sustainable energy balance in microalgae-based products process operations. Additionally, the small size of microalgal cells along with their negatively charged cell surface and cell density similar to the growth medium produces challenges in microalgae harvesting. The high cost associated with microalgae harvesting is a major bottleneck for commercialization of algae-based industrial products. Hence, microalgae harvesting is recognized as an area that needs to be explored and developed. This article aims to collate and present an overview of current harvesting strategies such as physical, chemical, biological, electrical and magnetic methods along with their future prospects. This review also highlights the evolution of microalgal harvesting and elucidates the fundamental phenomena of each technology in relation to key physical parameters such as morphology, size, density and surface charge. Besides throwing widespread light on various harvesting methods, this review article has also presented their advantages and disadvantages. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and technoeconomic analysis (TEA) was reviewed to assess the feasibility of various harvesting system for commercial application based on the environmental and technoeconomic impacts. Hence, the vital proposals provided in this review article would undeniably pave the way for choosing the appropriate harvesting strategy.

TI  - Marine Microalgae CLIMATE, ENERGY, AND FOOD SECURITY FROM THE SEA
AB  - Climate, energy, and food security are three of the greatest challenges society faces this century. Solutions for mitigating the effects of climate change often conflict with solutions for ensuring society's future energy and food requirements. For example, BioEnergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) has been proposed as an important method for achieving negative CO2 emissions later this century while simultaneously producing renewable energy on a global scale. However, BECCS has many negative environmental consequences for land, nutrient, and water use as well as biodiversity and food production. In contrast, large-scale industrial cultivation of marine microalgae can provide society with a more environmentally favorable approach for meeting the climate goals agreed to at the 2015 Paris Climate Conference, producing the liquid hydrocarbon fuels required by the global transportation sector, and supplying much of the protein necessary to feed a global population approaching 10 billion people.

TI  - Potential negative effects of ocean afforestation on offshore ecosystems
AB  - Ocean afforestation is a proposed method for large-scale carbon dioxide removal, involving exporting rafts of nearshore macroalgae to the open ocean for long-term occupation and then sinking. In this Perspective, the authors caution that this approach has multiple potential ramifications for ocean chemistry and ecology. Our scientific understanding of climate change makes clear the necessity for both emission reduction and carbon dioxide removal (CDR). The ocean with its large surface area, great depths and long coastlines is central to developing CDR approaches commensurate with the scale needed to limit warming to below 2 degrees C. Many proposed marine CDR approaches rely on spatial upscaling along with enhancement and/or acceleration of the rates of naturally occurring processes. One such approach is `ocean afforestation', which involves offshore transport and concurrent growth of nearshore macroalgae (seaweed), followed by their export into the deep ocean. The purposeful occupation for months of open ocean waters by macroalgae, which do not naturally occur there, will probably affect offshore ecosystems through a range of biological threats, including altered ocean chemistry and changed microbial physiology and ecology. Here, we present model simulations of ocean afforestation and link these to lessons from other examples of offshore dispersal, including rafting plastic debris, and discuss the ramifications for offshore ecosystems. We explore what additional metrics are required to assess the ecological implications of this proposed CDR. In our opinion, these ecological metrics must have equal weight to CDR capacity in the development of initial trials, pilot studies and potential licensing.

TI  - CULTIVATION AND HARVESTING OF OIL PRODUCING ALGAE IN HYBRID POND SYSTEMS
AB  - Algae is the potential feedstock for bio-fuel production as compared to other fodder crops. This group of microscopic and macroscopic autotroph has been given priority because of the eco-friendly nature, carbon sequestration tendency, production of high fatty acids content as raw material for biofuel industry, protein rich cells, farmer friendly cultivation and rapid multiplication. Developed countries are cultivating fatty acid rich algae in giant photo bioreactors which are quite expensive. The open pond cultivation of algae might lead to severe contamination and therefore the present authors has emphasized on the farmer friendly module of algae cultivation in a farmer dominated country like India by using hybrid pond system. Such ponds are easy to construct, operate and handle. This paper will facilitate the algal production by the smallest sectors of the society which shall be highly useful for mass production of bio-fuel by the industries.

TI  - A Novel Approach for the Biological Desalination of Major Anions in Seawater Using Three Microalgal Species: A Kinetic Study
AB  - The global water shortage alert has been upgraded to a higher risk level. Consequently, a sustainable approach for ecofriendly, energy efficient water desalination is required for agricultural and municipal water reuse. In this study, an energy-efficient biological desalination process was used to treat chloride anions, which are the most abundant anion salt in seawater. Three algal species were studied: Scenedismus arcuatusa (S. arcuatusa), Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris), and Spirulina maxima (Sp. maxima), under different operating conditions (saline concentrations, contact time, high light intensity, and CO2 supply), and two kinetic models were used. It was identified that under a high light intensity and CO2 supply, S. arcuatusa enhanced chloride removal from 32.42 to 48.93\%; the daily bioaccumulation capacity (Q(e)), according to the kinetic models, was enhanced from 124 to 210 mg/g/day; and the net biomass production was enhanced from 0.02 to 0.740 g/L. The EDX analysis proved that salt bioaccumulation may be attributed to the replacement of Ca2+ and Mg2+ with Na+ and K+ through algal cells. The study's findings provide promising data that can be used in the search for novel energy-efficient alternative ecofriendly desalination technologies based on algae biological systems with biomass byproducts that can be reused in a variety of ways.

TI  - Life cycle impact assessment of seaweed based biostimulant production from onshore cultivated Kappaphycus alvarezii (Doty) Doty ex Silva-Is it environmentally sustainable?
AB  - Seaweeds are recognized as one of the important sources of plant biostimulants and are now being increasingly used to enhance crop productivity. Kappaphycus alvarezii is one such seaweed whose extract (pristine sap) has been reported to improve the yield and quality of several crops. In order to evaluate whether the sap obtained from this seaweed is environmentally sustainable, life cycle impact assessment was carried out for the production of 1kL of seaweed extract, at factory gate, from the fresh biomass of K. alvarezii grown onshore in open sea conditions. Financial allocation was carried out to account for the production of carrageenan, a downstream product. Impacts were also assessed for different means of transportation necessary for the movement of liquid extract to the regional storage facility. Additionally, eight different scenarios that were hypothesized to effectively reduce the environmental impacts, especially under the category of climate change, were also assessed and compared with base case scenario. Pristine sap extracted from K. alvarezii was found to be environmentally sustainable having a low carbon foot print of 118.6kg CO2 equivalents per kiloliter of its production at factory gate following price allocation. It was observed that rail, road and ship transport modes increased the impacts under the climate change category by 51.8%, 138.5% and 14.1%, respectively, when compared to base case, implying that transport through sea or rail is more environmental friendly. Unexpectedly, increase in net biomass production by 25% from 200kg to 250kg per raft did not have any significant impact on the reduction of carbon foot print at factory gate. The study for the first time enables to quantitatively compare the environmental benefits that can accrue following the use of this biostimulant on various crops, either by way of substitution of mineral fertilizers or by supplementation.

TI  - Effects of energy storage by the seaweeds on their ecosystem
AB  - In marine environment, every species store energy for its own use and deliver it to its predator. Phytoplankton and seaweeds take place at the beginning of the food chain, grow in shallow waters with photosynthesis, and compete for the solar energy. Although the biomass of the phytoplankton amounts 1\%-2\% of the total global plant carbon, they carry out more than 40\% of the global photosynthesis. In the food chain, the largest amount of exergy is destroyed and the largest amount of entropy is generated while going from the first to the second species in the food chain, most probably because of the conversion of the plant cell into an animal cell. Results of this study indicated that the chemical nature of the stored material, for example, fat, protein, or carbohydrate, is not related with the location of the species in the food chain. Global production of macroalgae was approximately 3 million tons in 2012, and their consumption is projected to reach 13 million tons by 2050. If the energy available for the phytoplankton should be stored by the seaweeds grown in man-made farms in irrational amounts, competition of the seaweeds with the phytoplankton may be a major blow to marine ecology.

TI  - Carbon metabolism and bioavailability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes in seagrass communities are altered under the presence of the tropical invasive alga Halimeda incrassata
AB  - Seagrass beds act as blue carbon sinks globally as they enhance the trapping of recalcitrant (i.e., low biodegradability) organic carbon in their sediments. Recent studies also show that the recalcitrant fraction of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool in seawater has an important role as long-term carbon sequestration in oceans. Although seagrasses are known for the large amount of DOC they export, little attention has been given to its biodegradability, which ultimately determinates its fate in the coastal carbon cycle. In turn, invasive algae are a major global concern in seagrass ecosystems since they can deeply modify their structure and functions, which may affect carbon metabolism and DOC release. This work assesses how the presence of Halimeda incrassata, an invasive tropical calcareous macroalga, modifies carbon metabolism and DOC fluxes in invaded areas dominated by the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa. Our results show that stands with the presence of this seagrass (i.e., both monospecific and mixed meadow) had the highest production values, acting as high DOC producers in both winter (mainly of labile DOC; DOCL) and summer (mainly as recalcitrant DOC; DOCR). In contrast, monospecific H. incrassata beds exhibited low production values, and the presence of this macroalga (either as monospecific beds or mixed with C. nodosa) triggered the shift from a net DOC-producingsystem in summer (mainly DOCL) to a net DOC-consuming-system in winter. This work thus suggests that C. nodosa meadows have the potential to export a significant fraction of both labile and recalcitrant DOC, and that the spread of this invasive alga might decrease the C export capacity of seagrass meadows. Such shift would imply the reduction of a quick and efficient transfer of carbon and energy to higher trophic levels, and might reduce the blue carbon potential of seagrasses as dissolved form in the water column.

TI  - Algae as Feedstuff for Ruminants: A Focus on Single-Cell Species, Opportunistic Use of Algal By-Products and On-Site Production
AB  - There is a wide range of algae species originating from a variety of freshwater and saltwater habitats. These organisms form nutritional organic products via photosynthesis from simple inorganic substances such as carbon dioxide. Ruminants can utilize the non-protein nitrogen (N) and the cell walls in algae, along with other constituents such as minerals and vitamins. Over recent decades, awareness around climate change has generated new interest into the potential of algae to suppress enteric methane emissions when consumed by ruminants and their potential to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide. Despite the clear potential benefits, large-scale algae-livestock feedstuff value chains have not been established due to the high cost of production, processing and transport logistics, shelf-life and stability of bioactive compounds and inconsistent responses by animals under controlled experiments. It is unlikely that algal species will become viable ingredients in extensive grazing systems unless the cost of production and practical systems for the processing, transport and feeding are developed. The algae for use in ruminant nutrition may not necessarily require the same rigorous control during the production and processing as would for human consumption and they could be grown in remote areas or in marine environments, minimizing competition with cropping, whilst still generating high value biomass and capturing important amounts of atmospheric carbon. This review will focus on single-cell algal species and the opportunistic use of algal by-products and on-site production.

TI  - The effect of increasing CO2 concentrations on its capture, biomass production and wastewater bioremediation by microalgae and cyanobacteria
AB  - The accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, as well as the enrichment of water courses in nutrients are environmental issues associated to numerous impacts on ecosystems. Several attempts have been made to address these issues, but the cost and sustainability of current methodologies are still a concern. Cultivation of photosynthetic microorganisms appears as a sustainable solution because: (i) they can effectively uptake CO2 and nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus; and (ii) the resulting biomass can be processed into valuable products. In this study, the effect of different CO2 concentrations (from approximately 0.04 to 10\% v/v) on CO2 capture, biomass production and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) uptake was assessed for the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and the cyanobacteria Synechocystis salina and Microcystis aeruginosa grown at laboratory scale under batch mode. For the studied range of CO2 concentrations, C. vulgaris, S. salina and M. aeruginosa have reached the highest biomass productivities (0.126 +/- 0.033 g(dw) L-1 d(-1)) and carbon fixation rates (0.101 +/- 0.027 g(C) L-1 d(-1)). These microorganisms have also been effective in nutrients uptake, reaching removal efficiencies close to 100\%. Through mathematical modelling, it was possible to conclude that optimal CO2 concentration for these microorganisms was 5.35 +/- 0.34\% (v/v). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Hybrid solar-seaweed biorefinery for co-production of biochemicals, biofuels, electricity, and water: Thermodynamics, life cycle assessment, and cost-benefit analysis
AB  - Combing solar energy with biomass processing facilities are emerging systems for efficient use of solar energy for electricity generation, energy storage, and production of renewable materials. In this work, we propose a novel combination of solar thermal energy systems with marine macroalgae biorefinery, which requires energy inputs for biomass cultivation and processing. In this work, we analyze a 10-ton dry weight per hour capacity pilot-scale hybrid solar seaweed biorefinery, located at the Mishor Rotem near Dimona, the current location for solarthermal projects in Israel, where seaweed biomass supply comes from a hypothetical offshore farm located 15 km offshore. Our energy and mass balance analysis show that the overall First Law efficiency of the hybrid solar seaweed biorefinery system for the co-production of protein, hydrochar, ethanol, distilled water, and electricity is 32\% and can exceed 40\% with additional waste stream recycling. Our cost-benefit analysis of the proposed solar-seaweed biorefinery shows that the prices of seaweed, electricity, and protein are the key drivers of the profitability of the production process. The environmental impacts of the hybrid solar-seaweed biorefinery with intensified offshore cultivated biomass were quantified under various seaweed cultivation, transportation, and processing strategies.

TI  - Perspectives for improving circular economy in brackish shrimp aquaculture
AB  - Shrimp farming in South-East Asian and Latin American coastal regions generates economic benefits for the producer countries and contributes to a healthy nutrition of consumers. However, shrimp farming uses great amounts of fish meal and fish oil in the feed for the provision of essential proteins and polyunsaturated fatty acids during growth. This practice contributes to the environmental burden of the production process, as it is estimated that 25\% of the total wild capture fish is used to produce these compounds. Also, intensive brackish water farming in coastal regions promotes the shrinkage of mangrove forests and the contamination of surrounding soil and water resources, causing further environmental degradation. In this work, several concepts for wastewater and sludge treatment in brackish water aquaculture are reviewed, and a novel concept that combines aquaculture with the production of macroalgae and microalgae is proposed to achieve a circular system. Macroalgae can assimilate nitrogen and phosphorus in the wastewater stream, which enables the recirculation of the salty water. Solid residues are converted via anaerobic digestion into several short-chain carboxylic acids and methane. While methane can be used for electric energy and heat provision, the acids can be consumed by heterotrophic microalgae. Both macroalgae and microalgae can be applied as feed additives in shrimp aquaculture, providing proteins and polyunsaturated fatty acid sources. This integrated concept can enable the production of shrimp without the addition of fish meal and oil, enhance nutrient recycling in brackish aquaculture, and minimize the contamination of coastal land and water.

TI  - Enhanced Colaconema formosanum biomass and phycoerythrin yield after manipulating inorganic carbon, irradiance, and photoperiod
AB  - Due to an increasing CO2 concentration leading to global warming, the techniques as carbon capture utilization and storage are currently critical issues. This study aimed to investigate a cultivation strategy using optimal inorganic carbon level, irradiance, and photoperiod for producing the highest biomass and photosynthesis pigment contents (chlorophyll and phycobiliprotein) in the macroalga Colaconema formosanum. The results revealed that adding 1 g L-1 carbon increases phycoerythrin ratio by 12.52â€“13.74% and decreases allophycocyanin by 10.4â€“9.57%. Optimal conditions can increase algal growth by 60%, providing 5â€“6 mg gâˆ’1 total phycobiliprotein and 650â€“680 Âµg gâˆ’1 total chlorophyll. The results in this study illustrate the sensitivity of photosynthesis pigment after treatment with carbon, and suggest a hypothesis explaining the mechanism. The results also provide a feasible use of carbon for high-value large-scale production of pigment in the macroalgae industry. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Mass Cultivation of Microalgae: I. Experiences with Vertical Column Airlift Photobioreactors, Diatoms and CO2 Sequestration
AB  - From 2015 to 2021, we optimized mass cultivation of diatoms in our own developed vertical column airlift photobioreactors using natural and artificial light (LEDs). The project took place at the ferrosilicon producer Finnfjord AS in North Norway as a joint venture with UiT-The Arctic University of Norway. Small (0.1-6-14 m(3)) reactors were used for initial experiments and to produce inoculum cultures while upscaling experiments took place in a 300 m(3) reactor. We here argue that species cultivated in reactors should be large since biovolume specific self-shadowing of light can be lower for large vs. small cells. The highest production, 1.28 cm(3) L-1 biovolume (0.09-0.31 g DW day(-1)), was obtained with continuous culture at ca. 19\% light utilization efficiency and 34\% CO2 uptake. We cultivated 4-6 months without microbial contamination or biofouling, and this we argue was due to a natural antifouling (anti-biofilm) agent in the algae. In terms of protein quality all essential amino acids were present, and the composition and digestibility of the fatty acids were as required for feed ingredients. Lipid content was ca. 20\% of ash-free DW with high EPA levels, and omega-3 and amino acid content increased when factory fume was added. The content of heavy metals in algae cultivated with fume was well within the accepted safety limits. Organic pollutants (e.g., dioxins and PCBs) were below the limits required by the European Union food safety regulations, and bioprospecting revealed several promising findings.

TI  - Assessment of carbon sequestration potential of algae of a Ramsar site in Pakistan - Uchalli Wetland Complex
AB  - Algae has a great CO2 biofixation potential that plays crucial role in regulating global carbon cycle and sustaining the ecology. Biosequestration of carbon is more efficient, sustainable, and has broader spectrum than its sequestration via various synthetic means. This study has analyzed the carbon sequestration potential of algae of Uchalli Wetland Complex (UWC) to mimic the natural microalgae function to realize the ecological significance of the complex being an important Ramsar site. The microalgal mats/colonies were sampled from three lakes, i.e., Khabeki, Uchalli, and Jahlar lakes, for consecutive eight months with an interval of 30 days to determine the carbon sequestration potential of the UWC. Maximum percentages of carbon (25.33-31.55\%), hydrogen (3.86-4.68\%), and nitrogen (2.9-3.45\%) in the microalgal mats of Jahlar Lake, whereas highest sulfur content (5.9-7.42\%) was observed in microalgal colonies of Khabeki Lake. Growth kinetics depicts maximum biomass productivity (4.5 x 10(6) avg.) in September while maximum CO2 sequestration (75.7 g(-2) month(-1)) is detected in algal mats of Uchalli Lake. This study explored an undiscovered carbon sequestering potential of about 108.6 g(-2) month(-1) of algae of UWC that is certainly assistive in combating the climate change. Pearson's correlation generated significant relationships among different studied parameters at 0.01 and 0.05 levels. Statistical analysis by ANOVA with respect to lakes showed significant values (p = 0.000-0.003) of pH, salinity, carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, sulfur, CO2 fixed, C/N, and C/H.

TI  - Atmospheric CO2 capture by algae: Negative carbon dioxide emission path
AB  - Carbon dioxide is one of the most important greenhouse gas, which concentration increase in the atmosphere is associated to climate change and global warming. Besides CO2 capture in large emission point sources, the capture of this pollutant from atmosphere may be required due to significant contribution of diffuse sources. The technologies that remove CO2 from atmosphere (creating a negative balance of CO2) are called negative emission technologies. Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage may play an important role for CO2 mitigation. It represents the combination of bioenergy production and carbon capture and storage, keeping carbon dioxide in geological reservoirs. Algae have a high potential as the source of biomass, as they present high photosynthetic efficiencies and high biomass yields. Their biomass has a wide range of applications, which can improve the economic viability of the process. Thus, this paper aims to assess the atmospheric CO2 capture by algal cultures.

TI  - Seaweed farming for food and nutritional security, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and women empowerment: A review
AB  - Seaweed is a promising marine macroalgae of the millennium, providing various ecological, social, and economic benefits. At present, seaweed production reached 35.8 million t from farming, accounting for 97% of global seaweed output, with a world market of US$ 11.8 billion. Seaweeds are an excellent source of nutritious human food because of their low lipid content, high minerals, fibers, polyunsaturated fatty acids, polysaccharides, vitamins, and bioactive compounds. Many seaweed sub-products offer unique properties to develop various functional foods for the food processing industries. In the perspective of climate change mitigation, seaweed farms absorb carbon, serve as a CO2 sink and reduce agricultural emissions by providing raw materials for biofuel production and livestock feed. Seaweed farming system also helps in climate change adaptation by absorbing wave energy, safeguarding shorelines, raising the pH of the surrounding water, and oxygenating the waters to minimize the impacts of ocean acidification and hypoxia on a localized scale. Moreover, it contributes substantially to the sustainable development of the economic condition of coastal women by providing livelihood opportunities and ensuring financial solvency. This review paper highlights the significance of seaweed farming in global food and nutritional security, mitigation and adaptation to global climate change, and women empowerment within a single frame. This review paper also outlined the major issues and challenges of seaweed farming for obtaining maximum benefits in these aspects. The main challenges of making seaweed as a staple diet to millions of people include producing suitable species of seaweeds, making seaweed products accessible, affordable, nutritionally balanced, and attractive to the consumers. Various food products must be developed from seaweeds that may be considered equivalent to the foods consumed by humans today. Lack of effective marine spatial planning to avoid user conflicts is vital for expanding the seaweed farming systems to provide aquatic foods and contribute globally for mitigation and adaptation of climate change impacts. Hence, women's empowerment through seaweed farming is primarily constrained by the lack of technical knowledge and financial resources to establish the coastal farming system. All the information discussed in this paper will help to understand the critical needs for large-scale seaweed farming for climate resilience mariculture, potentials for global food security, and future research on various aspects of seaweed farming and their diverse utilization.

TI  - Combination of solar disinfection (SODIS) with H2O2 for enhanced disinfection of marine aquaculture effluents
AB  - Technologically advanced recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS), developed for intensive farming, allows to recycle about 90â€“99% of water. As a result, accumulation of pathogenic bacteria in water often occurs and possesses threat of infectious fish diseases. The goal of this study was to evaluate feasibility of solar disinfection in combination with hydrogen peroxide for seawater and real marine aquaculture effluent. Specific roles of solar disinfection (SODIS), hydrogen peroxide and highly reactive oxidizing species (experiments conducted in presence of tert-butyl alcohol), generated in combined SODIS/H2O2 process were investigated. Natural consortia of Vibrio spp., known as highly resistant pathogen, present in seawater and real marine aquaculture effluent were chosen as target microorganisms. The SODIS/H2O2 process significantly enhances inactivation of natural Vibrio consortia (Vibrio harveyi, Vibrio owensii and Vibrio alfacsensis) in seawater in comparison with individual SODIS and H2O2 treatment. The best results in terms of Vibrio spp. inactivation efficiency was obtained with SODIS/H2O2 conducted using open channel raceway reactor. The efficiency of Vibrio spp. inactivation by SODIS/H2O2 in raceway and compound parabolic collector (CPC) reactors was found to be similar, requiring the dose of 28â€“29 Wh mâˆ’2 for complete inactivation of Vibrio spp. present in seawater. Absence of toxic effect of residual H2O2 for Nannochloropsis gaditana, as well as absence of Vibrio spp. regrowth (48 h) indicate suitability of SODIS/H2O2 process for inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in aquaculture effluent and following nutrients removal by microalgae. Moreover, feasibility of SODIS/H2O2 performed in raceway reactor for disinfection of real aquaculture effluent, containing more than 5â‹…103 CFU mLâˆ’1 of Vibrio harveyi, was demonstrated requiring the dose of 34.4 Wh mâˆ’2 for complete Vibrio spp. inactivation. The annual operation and maintenance cost of aquaculture effluent disinfection using CPC and raceway reactors were evaluated. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Adsorption of CO2 from flue gas by novel seaweed-based KOH-activated porous biochars
AB  - Recently, environmental problems such as climate change and global warming caused by the greenhouse effect have become a worldwide topic of concern. In this article, two kinds of seaweed porous biochars were prepared by utilizing widely sourced seaweed (sargassum and enteromorpha) using single step KOH activation. The physical and chemical properties of the seaweed porous biochar adsorbents were characterized, and CO2 adsorption performance over seaweed porous biochars was tested in a fixed-bed adsorption system. The textural properties and functional groups of the raw seaweed biochars are significantly improved by KOH activation. The seaweed porous biochars (SCK-800-1 and ECK-800-1) prepared with KOH/biomass weight ratio of 1:1 at 800 Â°C exhibit the maximum CO2 capacity (reaching 1.05 mmol/g and 0.52 mmol/g at 25 Â°C, respectively). The adsorption capacity of CO2 decreases with the increase of adsorption temperature, and increases with the increase of CO2 initial concentration. The flue gas components such as O2 and NO do not affect the adsorption capacity of CO2 for SCK-800-1 and ECK-800-1, while SO2 slightly inhibits the CO2 adsorption performance. After ten cycles of adsorption-desorption, the adsorption capacities of seaweed porous biochars only decrease slightly. The pseudo-first order model better fits the experimental data, which demonstrates that the external mass transfer plays a dominant role in CO2 adsorption over two kinds of seaweed porous biochars. The present results may inspire new research interests and provide necessary theoretical guidance for the application and research of seaweed biomass-based biochars for CO2 capture, and effectively expand the utilization of marine biomasss.

We investigated organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) stocks and burial rates at four adjacent vegetated coastal habitats across the seascape elevation gradient of Cadiz Bay (South Spain), including one species of salt marsh, two of seagrasses, and a macroalgae. OC and TN stocks in the upper 1 m sediment layer were higher at the subtidal seagrass Cymodocea nodosa (72.3 Mg OC ha(-1), 8.6 Mg TN ha(-1)) followed by the upper intertidal salt marsh Sporobolus maritimus (66.5 Mg OC ha(-1), 5.9 Mg TN ha(-1)), the subtidal rhizophytic macroalgae Caulerpa prolifera (62.2 Mg OC ha(-1), 7.2 Mg TN ha(-1)), and the lower intertidal seagrass Zostera noltei (52.8 Mg OC ha(-1), 5.2 Mg TN ha(-1)). The sedimentation rates increased from lower to higher elevation, from the intertidal salt marsh (0.24 g cm(-2) y(-1)) to the subtidal macroalgae (0.12 g cm(-2) y(-1)). The organic carbon burial rate was highest at the intertidal salt marsh (91 +/- 31 g OC m(-2) y(-1)), followed by the intertidal seagrass, (44 +/- 15 g OC m(-2) y(-1)), the subtidal seagrass (39 +/- 6 g OC m(-2) y(-1)), and the subtidal macroalgae (28 +/- 4 g OC m(-2) y(-1)). Total nitrogen burial rates were similar among the three lower vegetation types, ranging from 5 +/- 2 to 3 +/- 1 g TN m(-2) y(-1), and peaked at S. maritimus salt marsh with 7 +/- 1 g TN m(-2) y(-1). The contribution of allochthonous sources to the sedimentary organic matter also decreased with elevation, from 72\% in C. prolifera to 33\% at S. maritimus. Our results highlight the need of using habitat-specific OC and TN stocks and burial rates to improve our ability to predict OC and TN sequestration capacity of vegetated coastal habitats at the seascape level. We also demonstrated that the stocks and burial rates in C. prolifera habitats were within the range of well-accepted blue carbon ecosystems such as seagrass meadows and salt marshes.

TI  - Development of the high-productivity marine microalga, Picochlorum renovo , as a photosynthetic protein secretion platform
AB  - Microalgae are remarkable in their ability to convert CO2 and sunlight into renewable biomass and bioproducts. Here, we have established a novel photosynthetic protein production platform via computational prediction and genetic engineering using native microalgal protein secretory signal peptides to achieve functional secretion of the fluorescent protein mCherry. Importantly, this work was conducted in the recently characterized alga Picochlorum renovo, an alga of industrial interest due to its rapid growth rate, tolerance to both high temperature and salinity, and genetically tractable nuclear and chloroplast genomes. Genomic queries allowed the identification of native secretory signal peptides, which were N-terminally fused to mCherry allowing for secretion into the culture supernatant. Further characterization revealed no impact on fitness, a production rate of 0.19 mg/L/day, and titer of 0.37 mg/L of transgenic mCherry protein in culture supernatant. These findings lay the foundation for applied genetic engineering approaches that could enable CO2-sequestering, sustainable photoproduction of industrially relevant enzymes at low cost.

TI  - Laboratory studies on the biodegradation of organisms for estimating carbon storage potential in coastal aquatic ecosystems
AB  - To assess the potential as carbon storages of short-life organisms in shallow coastal areas, refractory carbon fractions were examined using rapid biodegradation experiments. Refractory fractions of primary producers, such as seaweed and phytoplankton represented 31.2\%-44.0\% of the total carbon content. The seagrass Zostera marina contained a high rate of refractory carbon fraction, with 83.4\% of the carbon in the belowground parts of Z. marina remaining as refractory carbon, which suggested that it had a significant function as a carbon storage in the shallow coastal area. The content of refractory carbon in the soft tissues of bivalves and gastropods were approximately 8.5\%-31.5\%, lower than that in other macrobenthos such as arthropods and echinoderms (29.7\%-52.0\%). The residual carbon in mollusk shells was mostly particulate inorganic carbon. In addition, 4.0\%-19.1\% of refractory organic carbon derived from polysaccharides and/or proteins in biominerals, while byssus remained. Considering the amount of shells in the shallow coastal zone, this organic carbon appeared to be a substantial carbon storage. Results suggested that not only primary producers but also macrobenthos and sessile animals have important carbon storage functions in coastal aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Using marine macroalgae for carbon sequestration: a critical appraisal
AB  - There has been a good deal of interest in the potential of marine vegetation as a sink for anthropogenic C emissions ({''}Blue Carbon{''}). Marine primary producers contribute at least 50\% of the world's carbon fixation and may account for as much as 71\% of all carbon storage. In this paper, we analyse the current rate of harvesting of both commercially grown and wild-grown macroalgae, as well as their capacity for photosynthetically driven CO2 assimilation and growth. We suggest that CO2 acquisition by marine macroalgae can represent a considerable sink for anthropogenic CO2 emissions and that harvesting and appropriate use of macroalgal primary production could play a significant role in C sequestration and amelioration of greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Ecological service value evaluation of seaweed aquaculture in Zhejiang and Jiangsu Provinces
AB  - The alternative cost method and opportunity cost method were used to evaluate the value of ecological services provided by seaweed aquaculture based on the study of seaweed farming in Zhejiang Province and Jiangsu Province from 2005 to 2014. The results showed that the value of direct ecological services mainly included three factors: the value of carbon capture, the value of eutrophication regulation and the value of heavy metal removal. The value of indirect ecological services included the value of avoided transformed forest land, avoided use of water resources, avoided use of fertilizer and avoided use of pesticide. In 2014, the values of three seaweed aquaculture direct ecological services are 0.41 million RMB, 1.97 million RMB, 0.61 million RMB for Zhejiang Province and 0.26 million RMB, 1.24 million RMB and 0.38 million RMB for Jiangsu Province, respectively; the value of four indirect ecological services are 464.87 million RMB, 11.61 million RMB, 3.09 million RMB and 11.77 million RMB for Zhejiang Province and 293.22 million RMB, 7.32 million RMB, 1.95 million RMB and 7.42 million RMB for Jiangsu Province. The total value of ecological services of seaweed aquaculture is far greater than the direct economic value of seaweed. The vast area of coastline indicates that seaweed farming has great potential for development, and the promotion of seaweed farming can not only be a solution to address the arable land and food crisis, but also has a positive effect on reducing carbon emissions, reducing nutrient pollution and coping with global changes.

TI  - Is Genetic Engineering a Route to Enhance Microalgae-Mediated Bioremediation of Heavy Metal-Containing Effluents?
AB  - Contamination of the biosphere by heavy metals has been rising, due to accelerated anthropogenic activities, and is nowadays, a matter of serious global concern. Removal of such inorganic pollutants from aquatic environments via biological processes has earned great popularity, for its cost-effectiveness and high efficiency, compared to conventional physicochemical methods. Among candidate organisms, microalgae offer several competitive advantages; phycoremediation has even been claimed as the next generation of wastewater treatment technologies. Furthermore, integration of microalgae-mediated wastewater treatment and bioenergy production adds favorably to the economic feasibility of the former process-with energy security coming along with environmental sustainability. However, poor biomass productivity under abiotic stress conditions has hindered the large-scale deployment of microalgae. Recent advances encompassing molecular tools for genome editing, together with the advent of multiomics technologies and computational approaches, have permitted the design of tailor-made microalgal cell factories, which encompass multiple beneficial traits, while circumventing those associated with the bioaccumulation of unfavorable chemicals. Previous studies unfolded several routes through which genetic engineering-mediated improvements appear feasible (encompassing sequestration/uptake capacity and specificity for heavy metals); they can be categorized as metal transportation, chelation, or biotransformation, with regulation of metal- and oxidative stress response, as well as cell surface engineering playing a crucial role therein. This review covers the state-of-the-art metal stress mitigation mechanisms prevalent in microalgae, and discusses putative and tested metabolic engineering approaches, aimed at further improvement of those biological processes. Finally, current research gaps and future prospects arising from use of transgenic microalgae for heavy metal phycoremediation are reviewed.

TI  - Design and analysis of wave energy buoy integrated with seaweed farming
AB  - Farming facilities in offshore face natural disasters caused by tropical storms. Without reliable design of mooring system, the wave load on the structure can easily damage it during a natural disaster event that could lead to unacceptable economic loss. Mooring failure represents the most common reason for the loss of ocean devices due to environmental load action and inappropriate design; because the developers concentrate much of their efforts on optimising the efficiency of the device and not enough attention is paid to the design of the mooring system. Thus, ensuring the security and safe deployment of very large floating structure system is very important issue for industrial marine farm and ocean energy activities. This paper presents design and analysis of wave energy integrated with seaweed farming system. The static model will predict the tension and tilt at each mooring component, including the anchor, for which the safe mass will be evaluated in terms of the vertical and horizontal tensions. Predictions can be saved to facilitate mooring motion correction. Time dependent currents can be entered to predict the dynamic response of the mooring. Â© 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

TI  - Effect of iron complexes with seawater extractable organic matter on oogenesis in gametophytes of a brown macroalga (Saccharina japonica)
AB  - The phenomenon of macroalgae depletion is a serious worldwide problem in terms of the destruction of eco-systems and reducing carbon fixation capacity in coastal areas. A lack of dissolved Fe is thought to be one of reasons for this phenomenon, and attempts have beenmade to develop Fe fertilization techniques. This study reports on the bioavailability of Fe species that are complexed with seawater extractable organic matter (SWEOM) derived from a compost and various chelators on oogenesis in a brown macroalga (Saccharina japonica). Oogenesis is induced by Fe uptake. Oogenesis assays indicate that Fe uptake can be explained by a ligand exchange reaction, suggesting that dissolved Fe in the form of a labile complex species could be used as a fertilizer. Fifty to eighty percent of gametophytes induced oogenesis in the presence of 0.16-0.27 mu M Fe species complexed with SWEOM. However, no oogenesis was observed in the presence of 1 mu M Fe species complexed with N,N'-bis(2-hydroxybenzyl) ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid, an inert Fe-containing complex. These results show that SWEOM can serve as a chelator for Fe fertilization. Moreover, the concentration of SWEOM extracted from a bark compost was more than ten times higher than the corresponding values obtained from dredged soil and peat, suggesting this type of compost represents a suitable source of SWEOM. These findings extend our current knowledge of the use of Fe fertilization for the restoration of seaweed beds.

TI  - Algal lipids for biofuel production: strategies, environmental impacts, downstream processing and commercialization
AB  - The demand for fossil fuels has resulted in their rapid depletion and rise in the fuel costs. Moreover, fossil fuels have serious negative impacts on the environment due to their harmful emissions leading to global warming. This has paved the way for research into finding a renewable alternative to fossil fuels and exploring potential biofuel feedstocks. Biofuels are non-toxic, renewable, and have properties that are similar to conventional fuels. Among the studied feed-stocks, microalgae serve as a viable biofuel feedstock due to a number of advantages over another plant-based feed-stocks. Algal biofuels can help to restore the former green environment by completely replacing fossil fuels. However, only large-scale production and commercialization can meet these requirements. Numerous studies have been conducted to screen algal species with higher lipid yield. Despite decades of intensive research, biofuels have not reached the target of replacing conventional fuels. This is due to the challenges at every stage of its production process, starting from large-scale cultivation to commercial release of product. Novel lipid recovery strategies can be employed to tackle these limitations. For example, hybrid liquid biphasic system can be used to decrease the production costs (Yong et al. in J Water Process Eng 38: 101665, 2020). The aim of the review is to summarize the up to date research in the field of algae biofuels and to bring the focus on characterization and commercialization of algal lipids as a source of alternate energy. Furthermore, strategies to improve lipid accumulation and challenges associated with existing technologies are also discussed.

TI  - Blue carbon: past, present and future, with emphasis on macroalgae
AB  - Blue carbon did not originally include macroalgal ecosystems; however evidence is mounting that macroalgal ecosystems function in marine carbon sequestration. The great majority of present day marine macroalgal net primary productivity (NPP) involves haptophytic algae on eroding shores. For these organisms the long-term storage of particulate organic carbon involves export from the site of production of biomass that has evaded parasites and grazers, and that some of the exported biomass is sedimented and stored rather than being mineralized en route by detritivores (microbes and fauna). Export from eroding shores, and subsequent storage, of haptophytic marine macroalgal particulate organic carbon could have started by 1.6 Ga. Storage on depositing shores close to the site of NPP by rhizophytic macroalgae and then by rhizophytic coastal seagrasses, tidal marshes and mangroves began not less than 209 Ma ago. Future increases in surface ocean temperatures may bring tropical marine macroalgae to their upper temperature limit, while temperate marine macroalgae will migrate poleward, in both cases assuming that temperature increases faster than genetic adaptation to higher temperature. Increased CO2 in the surface ocean will generally favour uncalcified over calcified marine macroalgae. This results in decreased CO2 release from decreased calcification, as well as decreased ballasting by CaCO3 of exported particulate organic carbon resulting in decreasing sedimentation. While much more work is needed, the available information suggests that macroalgae play a significant role in marine organic carbon storage.

TI  - Effects of ocean acidification on the physiological performance and carbon production of the Antarctic sea ice diatom Nitzschia sp. ICE-H
AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) resulting from increasing atmospheric CO2 strongly influences marine ecosystems, particularly in the polar ocean due to greater CO2 solubility. Here, we grew the Antarctic sea ice diatom Nitzschia sp. ICE-H in a semicontinuous culture under low (~ 400 ppm) and high (1000 ppm) CO2 levels. Elevated CO2 resulted in a stimulated physiological response including increased growth rates, chlorophyll a contents, and nitrogen and phosphorus uptake rates. Furthermore, high CO2 enhanced cellular particulate organic carbon production rates, indicating a greater shift from inorganic to organic carbon. However, the cultures grown in high CO2 conditions exhibited a decrease in both extracellular and intracellular carbonic anhydrase activity, suggesting that the carbon concentrating mechanisms of Nitzschia sp. ICE-H may be suppressed by elevated CO2. Our results revealed that OA would be beneficial to the survival of this sea ice diatom strain, with broad implications for global carbon cycles in the future ocean. Â© 2017

TI  - Biosorption-Cum-Bioaccumulation of Heavy Metals from Industrial Effluent by Brown Algae: Deep Insight
AB  - Biosorption by marine brown algae is considered to be very effective as the brown algae is found in diverse size and are having better efficiency in removing the heavy metals form wastewater which is one of the most critical problem now a days. Many micro and macroalgae are responsible for the recovery of different heavy metals. The brown seaweeds have the highest sorption capacity or higher rate of bioaccumulation for heavy metal ion than that of red and green seaweeds. Marine algae are fast growing algae and can perform relatively better as it requires a small amount of nutrients, CO2 and sunlight for its survival. The present literature covers the biosorption by marine algae mainly the brown algae which can be used all around the year. The carboxyl acid group present in these biomass is found to be the most dominant as well as most abundant functional group that are followed by fucoidan.

TI  - Organic carbon dynamics in mangrove ecosystems: A review
AB  - Our current knowledge on production, composition, transport, pathways and transform nations of organic carbon in tropical mangrove environments is reviewed and discussed. Organic carbon entering mangrove foodwebs is either produced autochthonously or imported by tides and/or rivers. Mangrove litter and benthic microalgae tire Usually the most important autochthonous carbon sources. Depending on local conditions, phytoplankton and seagrass detritus imported with tides may represent a significant supplementary carbon input. Litter handling by the fauna not only affects microbial carbon transformations, but also the amount of organic carbon available for export. Most mangrove detritus that enters the sediment is degraded by microorganisms. Aerobic respiration and anaerobic sulfate reduction are usually considered the most important microbial respiration processes, but recent evidence suggests that iron respiration may be important in mangrove sediments as well. Organic carbon that escapes microbial degradation is stored in sediments and in some mangrove ecosystems, organic-rich sediments may extend to several meters depth. Many mangrove forests also lose a significant fraction of their net primary production to coastal waters. Large differences occur between mangrove forests with respect to litter production and export. Mangrove-derived DOC is also released into the water column and can add to the total organic carbon export. Numerous compounds have been characterized from mangrove tissues, including carbohydrates, amino acids, lignin-derived phenols, tannins, fatty acids, triterpenoids and n-alkanes. Many of these may, together with stable isotopes, exhibit a strong source signature and are potentially useful tracers of mangrove-derived organic matter. Our knowledge on mangrove carbon dynamics has improved considerably in recent years, but there are still significant gaps and shortcomings. These are emphasized and relevant research directions are Suggested. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Negative carbon via ocean afforestation
AB  - Ocean Afforestation, more precisely Ocean Macroalgal Afforestation (OMA), has the potential to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations through expanding natural populations of macroalgae, which absorb carbon dioxide, then are harvested to produce biomethane and biocarbon dioxide via anaerobic digestion. The plant nutrients remaining after digestion are recycled to expand the algal forest and increase fish populations. A mass balance has been calculated from known data and applied to produce a life cycle assessment and economic analysis. This analysis shows the potential of Ocean Afforestation to produce 12 billion tons per year of biomethane while storing 19 billion tons of CO2 per year directly from biogas production, plus up to 34 billion tons per year from carbon capture of the biomethane combustion exhaust. These rates are based on macro-algae forests covering 9% of the world's ocean surface, which could produce sufficient biomethane to replace all of today's needs in fossil fuel energy, while removing 53 billion tons of CO2 per year from the atmosphere, restoring pre-industrial levels. This amount of biomass could also increase sustainable fish production to potentially provide 200 kg/yr/person for 10 billion people. Additional benefits are reduction in ocean acidification and increased ocean primary productivity and biodiversity. Â© 2012 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

TI  - Impact of microalgal cell wall biology on downstream processing and nutrient removal for fuels and value-added products
AB  - Recent development in strategies to overcome the environmental adversities are focused mainly on lowering the carbon footprints and to decrease the global temperature rise. Bioprocesses based on microalgae are promising due to a large spectrum of possible products, like platform chemicals, proteins and higher value products that can directly impart a fall in the carbon emission. Another promising approach towards sustainability is the integrated bio refinery cultivation of microalgae for waste water treatment with simultaneous production of fuels (alcohol and biodiesel), high value chemicals (Astaxanthin, Lutein, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)etc.), proteins etc, but the technology readiness level are rather low and therefore are not established. However, for sustainable, economical and feasible bioprocess strategies using microalgae intra and extracellular bio-components extraction and cell wall disruption techniques should be optimized whereas challenges like high energy consumption involving these stages in the process makes it futile. The efficiency of cell disruption techniques and product extraction varies within different microalgae and depends mainly on the growth conditions and cell wall composition. The current review describes the cell wall structure and its composition of green freshwater microalgae such as Botryococccus braunii, Scenedesmus obliquus, Desmodesmus sp., Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Chlorella vulgaris, Haematococcus pluvialis and marine forms like Dunaliella salina and Nannocholoropsis gaditana. Further, it highlights the green cell lysis technologies to disrupt cell walls and the future perspectives and challenges of algae in integrated wastewater treatment, CO2 capture, and energy-efficient algal cell wall disruption for utilizing microalgae for fuel production is discussed.

TI  - EXOGENOUS SOURCES OF INORGANIC CARBON FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS BY MARINE MACROALGAE
AB  - Thirty-five species of marine macroalgae were tested for their ability to remove inorganic carbon from seawater using the pH-drift technique. Six of these species, all Rhodophyta, were unable to use HCO3-.  The remaining species exhibited a range in ability to use HCO3- and deplete inorganic carbon (C(T)); the three most effective species, all Chlorophyta, raised the pH to over 10.50, depleted the concentration of CO2 effectively to zero, and depleted the concentration of C(T) to less than 50\% of that at air-equilibrium.  In contrast, the six species restricted to CO2 did not raise the pH above 9.0 at a CO2 concentration of about 1.5-mu-mol.L-1 and depleted the concentration of C(T) to about 80\% of that at air-equilibrium. Ability to raise pH and deplete C(T) was linked to the habitat in which the species grew.  Five of the six species which lack the ability to use HCO3- grow subtidally in relatively low light beneath a canopy of larger Phaeophyta.  None of these species grow in rockpools where carbon-depletion may occur.  Species from rockpools were all effective at removing inorganic carbon.  Competition for C(T) may be one of the factors that determines species composition in rockpools. There was a species-specific difference between the calculated concentration of C(T) at the end of a pH-drift experiment and that measured directly.  Most, but not all, species with the ability to generate high pH-values showed a lower than calculated final concentration of C(T) consistent with precipitation of CaCO3.  A number of Rhodophyta with no, or a limited, ability to use HCO3- showed the opposite response, with final concentrations of C(T) exceeding that calculated from the pH. Calculations based on the maximum gross rate of production of CO2 from HCO3- in the absence of external carbonic anhydrase confirmed the results of the pH-drift experiments by demonstrating HCO3- use in Monostroma fuscum (Post et Rupr.) Wittr. and Ulva lactuca L. and the lack of this ability in Lomentaria articulata (Huds.) Lyngb.  Rates of net photosynthesis at air-equilibrium were greater than 95\% of those at 2.3 mmol C(T).L-1 for many of the species which were able to use HCO3-, but on average only 72\% for the six species restricted to CO2.

TI  - Potential blue carbon from coastal ecosystems in the Republic of Korea
AB  - The sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and ocean into coastal ecosystems such as seaweed beds, seagrasses, saltmarshes, and tidal flats is an important and emerging area of interest due to their valuable role in carbon storage and potential for moderating climate conditions. Here, we investigated how these ecosystems in Korea can serve as carbon sinks and estimated the amount of CO2 that might be removed through aquaculture beds, artificial reefs, and sea forests. We also examined the benefits of restoring degraded coastal ecosystems. In total, we estimated that the 0.38 x 10(6) ha covered by Korean coastal ecosystems could potentially lock up approximately 1.01 x 10(6) t of CO2.

TI  - Second Generation Biofuels: High-Efficiency Microalgae for Biodiesel Production
AB  - The use of fossil fuels is now widely accepted as unsustainable due to depleting resources and the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the environment that have already exceeded the ``dangerously high{'' threshold of 450 ppm CO2-e. To achieve environmental and economic sustainability, fuel production processes are required that are not only renewable, but also capable of sequestering atmospheric CO2. Currently, nearly all renewable energy sources (e.g. hydroelectric, solar, wind, tidal, geothermal) target the electricity market, while fuels make up a much larger share of the global energy demand (similar to 66\%). Biofuels are therefore rapidly being developed. Second generation microalgal systems have the advantage that they can produce a wide range of feedstocks for the production of biodiesel, bioethanol, biomethane and biohydrogen. Biodiesel is currently produced from oil synthesized by conventional fuel crops that harvest the sun's energy and store it as chemical energy. This presents a route for renewable and carbon-neutral fuel production. However, current supplies from oil crops and animal fats account for only approximately 0.3\% of the current demand for transport fuels. Increasing biofuel production on arable land could have severe consequences for global food supply. In contrast, producing biodiesel from algae is widely regarded as one of the most efficient ways of generating biofuels and also appears to represent the only current renewable source of oil that could meet the global demand for transport fuels. The main advantages of second generation microalgal systems are that they: (1) Have a higher photon conversion efficiency (as evidenced by increased biomass yields per hectare): (2) Can be harvested batch-wise nearly all-year-round, providing a reliable and continuous supply of oil: (3) Can utilize salt and waste water streams, thereby greatly reducing freshwater use: (4) Can couple CO2-neutral fuel production with CO2 sequestration: (5) Produce non-toxic and highly biodegradable biofuels. Current limitations exist mainly in the harvesting process and in the supply of CO2 for high efficiency production. This review provides a brief overview of second generation biodiesel production systems using microalgae.

TI  - An illustrated review on cultivation and life history of agronomically important seaplants
AB  - Seaplants (a better alternative to the misnomer "Seaweeds"), by all means, are "future plants"; they have been projected as the future viand for ever-increasing human populations, viable and sustainable source for biofuel without disturbing global food scenario, as potential candidates for carbon capture and sequestration that is considered as a practical remedy for global warming, and they have a number of pharmaceutical, industrial and biotechnological applications. However, information on its cultivation methods or life history remains obscure to a majority of marine botanists. While life histories of seaweeds have traditionally been an exotic topic for specialists-language of which is ciphered with scientific jargons incomprehensible to general scientific audience, its agronomy had been a trade secret for coastal communities in East Asian countries, especially Japan, the Philippines and Indonesia. In this up-to-date illustrated review, current scientific understanding on the life-histories of agronomically pertinent seaweeds are presented in a fashion akin to popular science journalism with an overview of major coastal and offshore seaweed mariculture techniques, presented with the aid of clear-to-understand illustrations. Also discussed in this report are recent advances in the algal natural products; including uses in hydrocolloid and pharmaceutical industries, Integrated Multi Trophic Aquaculture, energy production, environmental impacts of the seafarming and its counter measures, before concluding with an overview of future research avenues.

TI  - Impact of Algal Blooms and Their Toxins on Reverse Osmosis Desalination Plant Operations
AB  - Seawater desalination by reverse osmosis (RO) has emerged over the past few decades as a reliable and necessary method for augmenting drinking water supplies in many parts of the world. As freshwater resources become limited due to global climate change, rising demand, and exhausted local water supplies, seawater desalination will play an increasingly important role in securing the world's future water supply. The global increase in occurrence and incidence of harmful algae blooms is a concern for RO desalination plants due to the high biomass of microalgae present in ocean waters during these events, and a variety of deleterious substances that some algae produce. The compounds range from innocuous substances that can cause membrane fouling, to noxious compounds and powerful neurotoxins that constitute significant public health risks if they are not effectively and completely removed by RO membranes. Algal blooms can cause significant operational issues that can necessitate costly pretreatment procedures, result in increased energy usage due to membrane fouling, and in extreme cases, require a plant to be removed from service. Early algal bloom detection by desalination facilities is essential so that operational adjustments can be made to ensure that production capacity remains unaffected. This chapter will focus on characterizing a range of substances of concern to desalination facilities, their known producers, and our present state of knowledge regarding substances of particular concern due to their toxicity. Also included is a case study from southern California, which involved the monitoring of intake and desalinated water from a pilot SWRO desalination facility, and bench-top SWRO experiments modeled the worst-case scenario toxic events for the local area.

Both plants and microalgae come from the same wetland, a recently restored area in Albufera de Valencia Natural Park (Spain). The need to replant the area under restoration with submerged macrophytes makes this information essential for wetland management. The selection and culture of the submerged macrophytes used in that restoration (four charophytes: Chara hispida, Chara vulgaris, Chara baltica, Nitella hyalina, and one angiosperm: Myriophyllum spicatum) provided a good opportunity to test in the laboratory the allelopathic effect of macrophyte assemblages on environmental phytoplankton communities. Three experiments were carried out using spring communities: in Experiment 1, a diverse phytoplankton assemblage (29\% of biomass Chlorophyceae, 26\% Cryptophyceae, 19\% diatoms and 9\% cyanobacteria) was cultivated with exudates from monocultures of C. hispida, N. hyalina and M. spicatum. Experiment 2 proved the allelopathic effect of a macrophyte assemblage exudate (C. hispida, C. baltica, C. vulgaris, N. hyalina and M. spicatum in a mixed culture) on two different phytoplankton communities (one diverse: 53\% biomass of diatoms, 27\% cyanobacteria, 18\% chlorophytes and another dominated by small chlorophytes). The response variables were Chl a concentration, phytoplankton biovolume and main algal groups' biovolumes. When phytoplankton grew in water with exudates from monocultures, microalgal biomass was from 4 to 6 times lower than in the control after 5 days and Chl a concentration was up to 4 times lower. The inhibitory effect of C. hispida was greater than that of M. spicatum. Mixed macrophyte assemblages resulted in even stronger allelopathic effects than monocultured macrophytes; the biomass was reduced by 7 fold after 5 days using the mixed exudates and Chl a concentration was between 3 and 5 times lower. The experiments demonstrate that macrophytes are particularly effective in inhibiting the growth of both small diatoms and the least desirable phytoplankton component in these wetlands (filamentous cyanobacteria), but not chlorophytes (reduction by 37-69, 7-14 and 1-7 fold for diatoms, cyanobacteria and chlorophytes, respectively). The predictions are that spring macrophytes might enhance microalgae that are suitable for grazing (mostly small chlorophytes) and will decrease non-edible filamentous taxa. Thus, restoration managers should replant with the mixture of submerged native macrophytes that provide the most harmful allelopathic effects to promote benefits on aquatic communities in two synergistic ways: by directly reducing microalgal biomass and by indirectly enhancing grazing, which in turn, would promote a clear-water phase. We present replanted macrophytes as ecosystem engineers, i.e. organisms that directly or indirectly modulate the availability of resources for the wetland food webs, by causing changes in primary producer assemblages.

TI  - Implementation of blue carbon offset crediting for seagrass meadows, macroalgal beds, and macroalgae farming in Japan
AB  - The â€œblue carbonâ€ concept and the role of blue carbon stored in shallow coastal ecosystems in mitigating climate change have attracted attention worldwide. In addition to typical blue carbon ecosystems, such as mangroves, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows, macroalgal beds and macroalgae farming are also gaining recognition as potential blue carbon sinks. Effective policies and methodologies are important for the conservation and expansion of blue carbon sinks, as well as the consequent reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). One of the most effective methods is carbon offset credit schemes. However, to date, almost all credit schemes have been implemented for mangroves and saltmarshes. None has been implemented for seagrass meadows, macroalgal beds, and macroalgae farming, although their CO2 uptake potentials are large. Here, we review three blue carbon offset credit projects for seagrass meadows, macroalgal beds, and macroalgae farming implemented in Japan. We show the blue carbon offset crediting projects of (1) Yokohama City, the first in the world; (2) Fukuoka City, the second such project in Japan; and (3) the first Japanese national governmental demonstration project. Furthermore, we highlight their characteristics by comparing them with the other blue carbon offset projects. Finally, we discuss the need to accelerate blue carbon offset credit projects and related initiatives in the future. Â© 2022 The Authors

TI  - Benthic foodweb of a salt marsh in an artificial lagoon, central Japan
AB  - Salt marsh rehabilitations have been carried out globally, with the goal of recovering structural characteristics such as diversity or abundance. Functional properties (e.g. foodwebs) are also important but less is known about the effects of rehabilitation on such factors. We investigated the benthic foodweb in a reconstructed salt marsh, which consisted of marsh vegetation and mudflats, in the artificial Shinhama Lagoon, at the head of Tokyo Bay, central Japan. We used stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis to assess the contributions of primary producers (marsh plants, phytoplankton, microphytobenthos and macroalgae) as nutrient sources for benthic invertebrates in vegetated and unvegetated habitats. Phytoplankton contributed to approximately 27\% of the diet of benthic invertebrates and was thus the highest contributor in both habitats. In addition, marsh plants contributed about 24\% of the diet of the invertebrates in vegetated habitats, and microphytobenthos contributed around 22\% of the diet in unvegetated habitats. These findings are consistent with those obtained from other intact salt marshes, suggesting that the artificial Shinhama Lagoon has evolved into a natural system in terms of the benthic foodweb approximately 30years after reconstruction. Results indicate that functional properties can be recovered by marsh restoration, and that future rehabilitation programmes should aim to recover whole ecosystems, i.e. both structural characteristics and functional properties.

TI  - Lipid extraction methods from microalgae: A comprehensive review
AB  - Energy security has become a serious global issue and a lot of research is being carried out to look for economically viable and environment-friendly alternatives. The only solution that appears to meet futuristic needs is the use of renewable energy. Although various forms of renewable energy are being currently used, the prospects of producing carbon-neutral biofuels from microalgae appear bright because of their unique features such as suitability of growing in open ponds required for production of a commodity product, high CO 2 -sequestering capability, and ability to grow in wastewater/seawater/brackish water and high-lipid productivity. The major process constraint in microalgal biofuel technology is the cost-effective and efficient extraction of lipids. The objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive review on various methods of lipid extraction from microalgae available, to date, as well as to discuss their advantages and disadvantages. The article covers all areas of lipid extraction procedures including solvent extraction procedures, mechanical approaches, and solvent-free procedures apart from some of the latest extraction technologies. Further research is required in this area for successful implementation of this technology at the production scale. Â© 2015 Ranjith Kumar, Hanumantha Rao and Arumugam.

TI  - Marine algae as a co2 sink
AB  - The most effective ways to reduce CO2 emissions are to improve the energy efficiency of each economic sector and to reduce the cutting of tropical and temperate forests around the world. These options, however, may not fully reach their technical and economic potential due to various political and socioeconomic barriers. Other more innovative and less well developed mitigation measures therefore will be required. The most practical of these is to increase CO2 sinks through photosynthesis in both standing tree biomass and in ocean primary producers. In this paper, the use of marine algae as CO2 sinks is reviewed from a technical, engineering/economic, and environmental perspective. Two open ocean options are considered for large-scale CO2 mitigation: the use of phytoplankton through Fe fertilization and macroalgal (kelp) farms, which can be used for both C sequestering and energy production. It has been estimated that these two approaches can sequester from 0.7 to 3 Gt C yr-1 from the atmosphere at an estimated cost of $5 to 300 t-1 C yr-1. Other options currently under study are also mentioned. Numerous questions remain to be answered pertaining to the use of both microalgae and macroalgae for CO2 assimilation before credible estimates of costs of C removal can be made for either system. In addition, there are several key environmental issues raised by the use of algae. A detailed discussion of these variables, including cost estimates, is presented.

TI  - Impacts of increased atmospheric CO2 concentration on photosynthesis and growth of micro- and macro-algae
AB  - Marine photosynthesis drives the oceanic biological CO2 pump to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, which sinks more than one third of the industry-originated CO2 into the ocean. The increasing atmospheric CO2 and subsequent rise of pCO(2) in seawater, which alters the carbonate system and related chemical reactions and results in lower pH and higher HCO3 (-) concentration, affect photosynthetic CO2 fixation processes of phytoplanktonic and macroalgal species in direct and/or indirect ways. Although many unicellular and multicellular species can operate CO2-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) to utilize the large HCO3 (-) pool in seawater, enriched CO2 up to several times the present atmospheric level has been shown to enhance photosynthesis and growth of both phytoplanktonic and macro-species that have less capacity of CCMs. Even for species that operate active CCMs and those whose photosynthesis is not limited by CO2 in seawater, increased CO2 levels can down-regulate their CCMs and therefore enhance their growth under light-limiting conditions (at higher CO2 levels, less light energy is required to drive CCM). Altered physiological performances under high-CO2 conditions may cause genetic alteration in view of adaptation over long time scale. Marine algae may adapt to a high CO2 oceanic environment so that the evolved communities in future are likely to be genetically different from the contemporary communities. However, most of the previous studies have been carried out under indoor conditions without considering the acidifying effects on seawater by increased CO2 and other interacting environmental factors, and little has been documented so far to explain how physiology of marine primary producers performs in a high-CO2 and low-pH ocean.

TI  - CO2 Biofixation by Microalgae: Modeling, Estimation and Control
AB  - Due to the consequences of global warming and large emissions of greenhouse gases, solutions for the sustainable development and the safeguarding of land resources are currently the focus of reflection and international actions. One of the major lines of action relates to the stabilization or reduction of greenhouse gases concentrations in the atmosphere. CO2 is the most important greenhouse gas, due to the increase of the world's production, deforestation and intensive use of fossil energy [PAC 07]. Furthermore, the proposal for a strategy for the reduction of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is a subject of research in full expansion. Several approaches are proposed, such as the reduction of emissions of this gas, its storage (geological, in the oceans or by mineralization), its adsorption or its absorption by chemical, geological or biological means [PIR 11]. This book focuses more particularly on CO2 fixation by biological means through the use of microalgae, in order to minimize the environmental impact of this sequestration. Carbon dioxide (CO2) biofixation by microalgae is a very promising CO2 mitigation strategy since these microorganisms are the most efficient to sequester CO2, in comparison with terrestrial plants. In the presence of light, microalgae are capable of assimilating CO2 to grow while producing oxygen and secondary metabolites, via photosynthesis. The use of microalgae for environmental purposes is thus a very promising solution due to their potential, the various advantages related to their growth rate and their high tolerance regarding high concentrations of CO2. In addition, they have a large number of uses on laboratory and industrial scales in different areas: they can be used to produce high value-added molecules in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, animal feed and human food, and they represent a feedstock for the production of renewable energy such as hydrogen, methane and biodiesel. Thus, the major aspect of CO2 biofixation by microalgae combines this sequestration with the production of value-added molecules. Â© ISTE Ltd 2014.

TI  - Enhancing CO2 bio-mitigation by genetic engineering of cyanobacteria
AB  - The increasing of atmospheric CO2, which is considered as a major greenhouse gas, plays a crucial role in global warming and climate change. In addition to reducing CO2 emissions from anthropogenic activities, it is more urgent to actively remove CO2 from the air. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a feasible but high-cost technology to remove CO2 from the flue gases of coal-fired power plants. On the other hand, CO2 sequestration by biological approaches shows potential and has the benefit that the biomass generated from the fixed CO2 can then be utilized for other purposes. However, CO2 bio-mitigation technology is still under development because the efficiency of CO2 capture and fixation is too low to be applicable in industry. In this study, we enhanced a photobioreactor-based microalgal CO2 mitigation system by combining the chemical capture/transformation of CO2 by carbonic anhydrase (CA) with the biological fixation of captured CO2 by cyanobacteria. We genetically engineered the cyanobacteria to produce and secrete CAs in the medium. The secreted CAs efficiently transformed dissolved CO2 to HCO3-. And HCO3- was taken up by the cyanobacteria and further fixed into biomass through photosynthesis. To our knowledge, we have demonstrated for the first time that CO2 can be sequestrated in a sustainable way through combining the chemical transformation of CO2 with the biological CO2 fixation in a microalgal photobioreactor system.

TI  - Optimization of the integrated power and desalination plant with algal cultivation system compromising the energy-water-environment nexus
AB  - This article examines the exhaust waste heat recovery potential of a microturbine (MT) for seawater desalination using an organic Rankine cycle (ORC). Waste heat from microturbine is exploited using organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and the power generated is delivered to the reverse osmosis (RO) plant. The brine of the reverse osmosis plant is sent to a membrane distillation (MD) plant for further treatment after preheating using the excess heat from the turbine. Also, biological capture of CO2 through cultivation of microalgae has been considered by using flue gases from the microturbine. Plant integration is performed on the basis of the energy-water-environment nexus concept. In this regard, a multi-objective optimization approach is implemented in this work considering economic and environmental points of views. The first objective function is to maximize the annual profit of the system. The second objective function is an environmental index which is defined as the CO2 emission per desalinated water production. Minimization of this index is considered as the second objective function. The results showed that the proposed integrated ORC-RO-MD-CO2 capture plant can considerably improve the system both economically and environmentally. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Cost-Benefit Analysis of a Hybrid Biophysical Approach to Wave Energy Extraction: Bio-Oscillator
AB  - A cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is described for a novel wave energy converters (WEC) design based on a marine hybrid bio-structure-a combination of macroalgae, shellfish or other species on a built frame. The Bio-Oscillator design utilises a hard ``skeleton{''} (e.g., carbon fibre, wood) on which biological organisms (e.g., shellfish, large macroalgae) are grown. As waves pass by, the load generated by the oscillating drag and inertia is transferred through mooring lines to power takeoff technology. This novel approach essentially reverses the typical marine engineering view that ``bio-fouling is bad{''} and instead leverages off the added-drag of biological growth on structures. The approach results in a structure that is largely biodegradable, naturally self-replicating and synergistic with the background environment, self-de-risking in terms of failure impact and can leverage off its own form to enhance energy capture beyond a conventional design. This reduces impact while connecting with conventional marine industries such as aquaculture. A CBA examines the economic pros and cons of this approach, focusing on installation and material costs, along with benefits from synergistic production. The analysis suggests that in addition to typical wave energy obstacles (e.g., cable length, capture width, and power take off) the benefits (biodegradability, harvestability, and carbon reduction) of replacing much of the mass of the structure with living biological material can be included.

TI  - Nutrient Supply to Seawater from Steelmaking Slag: The Coupled Effect of Gluconic Acid Usage and Slag Carbonation
AB  - Vanishing of seaweeds in coastal areas has become a serious environmental problem. Part of the reason is nutrient deficiency in seawater, especially iron. Steelmaking slag is probably one of the best nutrient suppliers in terms of cost and quantity. Utilizing steelmaking slag to fertilize coastal seaweeds may simultaneously address the two challenges of seaweed restoration and byproduct treatment. However, direct usage of slag from a basic oxygen furnace is not practical because of negative effects such as a sharp pH increase and magnesium loss. To address the disadvantages, this work investigated the leaching behavior of a practical steelmaking slag in an artificial seawater and clarified the coupled effect of gluconic acid usage and slag carbonation on aiding the nutrient supply. Slag carbonation prevents a drastic pH increase and Mg loss, while gluconic acid induces formation of stable chelated complexes. The combination of slag carbonation and gluconic acid usage results in significant improvements in the nutrient supply. By leaching the slag, the maximum concentration of Fe in seawater increases to 0.29 mg L-1, 193 times larger than the value in the initial seawater (1.5 mu g L-1).

TI  - Assessing risks and mitigating impacts of harmful algal blooms on mariculture and marine fisheries
AB  - Aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector globally and protein provisioning from aquaculture now exceeds that from wild capture fisheries. There is clear potential for the further expansion of marine aquaculture (mariculture), but there are associated risks. Some naturally occurring algae can proliferate under certain environmental conditions, causing deoxygenation of seawater, or releasing toxic compounds (phycotoxins), which can harm wild and cultured finfish and shellfish, and also human consumers. The impacts of these so-called harmful algal blooms (HABs) amount to approximately 8 \$billion/yr globally, due to mass mortalities in finfish, harvesting bans preventing the sale of shellfish that have accumulated unsafe levels of HAB phycotoxins and unavoided human health costs. Here, we provide a critical review and analysis of HAB impacts on mariculture (and wild capture fisheries) and recommend research to identify ways to minimise their impacts to the industry. We examine causal factors for HAB development in inshore versus offshore locations and consider how mariculture itself, in its various forms, may exacerbate or mitigate HAB risk. From a management perspective, there is considerable scope for strategic siting of offshore mariculture and holistic Environmental Approaches for Aquaculture, such as offsetting nutrient outputs from finfish farming, via the co-location of extractive shellfish and macroalgae. Such pre-emptive, ecosystem-based approaches are preferable to reactive physical, chemical or microbiological control measures aiming to remove or neutralise HABs and their phycotxins. To facilitate mariculture expansion and long-term sustainability, it is also essential to evaluate HAB risk in conjunction with climate change.

TI  - Biological removal of nitrogen oxides by microalgae, a promising strategy from nitrogen oxides to protein production
AB  - Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are the components of fossil flue gases that give rise to serious environmental and health hazards. Among the available techniques for NO3, removal, microalgae-based biological removal of NO3, (BioDeNO(x)) is a promising and competent technology with eco-friendly path of low energy and low-cost solution for the pollution. In this review article, current biological technologies including bacteria-based and microalgae-related BioDeNO(x) are discussed. Comparing to direct BioDeNO(x) approach, indirect BioDeNO(x) by microalgae is more promising since it is more stable, reliable and efficient. By transforming inorganic nitrogen nutrients to organic nitrogen, microalgae can potentially play an important role in converting NO3, into high-value added products. The microalgae-based BioDeNO(x) process displays an attractive prospect for flue gas treatment to reduce environmental NO3, pollution and potentially supply protein products, establishing an efficient circular-economy strategy.

TI  - Dimensions of blue carbon and emerging perspectives
AB  - Blue Carbon is a term coined in 2009 to draw attention to the degradation of marine and coastal ecosystems and the need to conserve and restore them to mitigate climate change and for the other ecosystem services they provide. Blue Carbon has multiple meanings, which we aim to clarify here, which reflect the original descriptions of the concept including (1) all organic matter captured by marine organisms, and (2) how marine ecosystems could be managed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and thereby contribute to climate change mitigation and conservation. The multifaceted nature of the Blue Carbon concept has led to unprecedented collaboration across disciplines, where scientists, conservationists and policy makers have interacted intensely to advance shared goals. Some coastal ecosystems (mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass) are established Blue Carbon ecosystems as they often have high carbon stocks, support long-term carbon storage, offer the potential to manage greenhouse gas emissions and support other adaptation policies. Some marine ecosystems do not meet key criteria for inclusion within the Blue Carbon framework (e.g. fish, bivalves and coral reefs). Others have gaps in scientific understanding of carbon stocks or greenhouse gas fluxes, or currently there is limited potential for management or accounting for carbon sequestration (macroalgae and phytoplankton), but may be considered Blue Carbon ecosystems in the future, once these gaps are addressed.

TI  - Laminarin is a major molecule in the marine carbon cycle
AB  - Marine microalgae sequester as much CO2 into carbohydrates as terrestrial plants. Polymeric carbohydrates (i.e., glycans) provide carbon for heterotrophic organisms and constitute a carbon sink in the global oceans. The quantitative contributions of different algal glycans to cycling and sequestration of carbon remain unknown, partly because of the analytical challenge to quantify glycans in complex biological matrices. Here, we quantified a glycan structural type using a recently developed biocatalytic strategy, which involves laminarinase enzymes that specifically cleave the algal glycan laminarin into readily analyzable fragments. We measured laminarin along transects in the Arctic, Atlantic, and Pacific oceans and during three time series in the North Sea. These data revealed a median of 26 +/- 17\% laminarin within the particulate organic carbon pool. The observed correlation between chlorophyll and laminarin suggests an annual production of algal laminarin of 12 +/- 8 gigatons: that is, approximately three times the annual atmospheric carbon dioxide increase by fossil fuel burning. Moreover, our data revealed that laminarin accounted for up to 50\% of organic carbon in sinking diatom-containing particles, thus substantially contributing to carbon export from surface waters. Spatially and temporally variable laminarin concentrations in the sunlit ocean are driven by light availability. Collectively, these observations highlight the prominent ecological role and biogeochemical function of laminarin in oceanic carbon export and energy flow to higher trophic levels.

TI  - Carbon sequestration and the role of biological carbon mitigation: A review.
AB  - Climate change and rising atmospheric CO2 levels have become much debated environmental issues in recent years. Point source emissions of CO2 from industrialised processes such as power generation and cement production account for much of this increase. Direct carbon sequestration and storage techniques such as geological injection have large storage capacities, however these methods are very cost inefficient and have not been proved safe for long term sequestration. A novel approach to offsetting emissions is through direct biological carbon mitigation where CO2 from the flue gases of point sources is used to cultivate photosynthetic autotrophic organisms. The produced biomass can subsequently be converted into biofuels, bio-chemicals, food or animal feed. These useful by-products provide revenue to finance the carbon mitigation process. Large-scale cultivation of biological media on site at a power generation plant means that substantial amounts of biomass could be readily available for co-firing in the plant, thus decreasing the demand for fossil fuels. This review gives an overview of the most suitable strains of microalgae for the purpose of carbon mitigation while the challenges associated with carbon mitigation strategies such as capital costs, environmental issues, and cultivation of microalgae using flue gases will also be assessed. Selected media will be required to have a high CO2 fixing rate, a rapid growth rate, while being easily cultivated on a large scale in order to generate a large biomass yield and produce valuable by-products to offset the costs of carbon mitigation. An economic balance is also discussed to give an indication of the cost benefits in the implementation of biological carbon mitigation policies as a solution to the high capital and running costs of large scale microalgal production.

TI  - Identifying Scaling Pathways and Research Priorities for Kelp Aquaculture Nurseries Using a Techno-Economic Modeling Approach
AB  - Aquaculture of seaweeds, particularly in emerging farming regions such as North America, Europe, and South America, is steadily increasing. The growth of the sector has been supported by public and private R&D investment with the long-term goal of reducing farm-gate production costs. Reducing expenses would potentially allow growers to target high volume, low value markets, such as hydrocolloids, animal feeds, food thickening agents, biofuels, and carbon dioxide removal (CDR), as well as the higher value, â€œwhole foodsâ€ markets. Regardless of the eventual fate of farmed seaweed, nursery production must increase in parallel with ocean cultivation to support the raw materials needs of the expanding industry. We quantified S. latissima (hereafter kelp) nursery production costs and identified potential barriers to cost-effective scaling using a techno-economic model (TEM). Semi-structured interviews with nursery operators in the U.S. and Europe were supplemented by an extensive literature review to parameterize the TEM. Reducing the sporophyte grow-out duration, increasing labor capacity, de-risking energy efficient flow-through systems, and optimizing tank and PVC â€œspoolâ€ size emerged as the most important research priorities based on our analysis. We point towards expanded gametophyte culture, and an associated policy framework to protect wild kelp population structure from monocultures, as necessary elements to support these potential improvements. The results of this work, as well as the open-source nursery TEM, are relevant to seaweed aquaculture producers, policy makers, and researchers, and can be used to guide future decision making regarding the cost-benefit of best available nursery technology.

TI  - Increased iron availability resulting from increased CO2 enhances carbon and nitrogen metabolism in the economical marine red macroalga Pyropia haitanensis (Rhodophyta)
AB  - Ocean acidification caused by rising CO2is predicted to increase the concentrations of dissolved species of Fe(II) and Fe(III), leading to the enhanced photosynthetic carbon sequestration in some algal species. In this study, the carbon and nitrogen metabolism in responses to increased iron availability under two CO2levels (390Â Î¼LÂ Lâˆ’1and 1000Â Î¼LÂ Lâˆ’1), were investigated in the maricultivated macroalga Pyropia haitanensis (Rhodophyta). The results showed that, elevated CO2increased soluble carbonhydrate (SC) contents, resulting from enhanced photosynthesis and photosynthetic pigment synthesis in this algae, but declined its soluble protein (SP) contents, resulting in increased ratio of SC/SP. This enhanced photosynthesis performance and carbon accumulation was more significant under iron enrichment condition in seawater, with higher iron uptake rate at high CO2level. As a key essential biogenic element for algae, Fe-replete functionally contributed to P.Â haitanensis photosynthesis. Increased SC fundamentally provided carbon skeletons for nitrogen assimilation. The significant increase of carbon and nitrogen assimilation finally contributed to enhanced growth in this alga. This was also intuitively reflected by respiration that provided energy for cellular metabolism and algal growth. We propose that, in the predicted scenario of rising atmospheric CO2, P.Â haitanensis is capable to adjust its physiology by increasing its carbon and nitrogen metabolism to acclimate the acidified seawater, at the background of global climate change and simultaneously increased iron concentration due to decreased pH levels.

TI  - Prospects of carbon capture and carbon sequestration using microalgae and macrophytes
AB  - The problem of increasing atmospheric CO2 is causing severe impact on the atmosphere resulting in critical issues like global climate change, which makes carbon sequestration an urgent mitigation strategy. Carbon sequestration, being different from carbon emission reduction, offers an opportunity of reducing atmospheric CO2 for the production of energy and valuable chemicals. Among several carbon sequestration techniques, biological sequestration of carbon through microalgae and macrophytes has gained importance due to a sustainable and promising alternative to other mitigation strategies. They have the potential to be cultivated in water and hence, there is no competition with food crop for fertile land. Their growth rate is much higher as well as CO2 fixing efficiency is almost 10â€“15 times more than terrestrial plants. This chapter aims to understand biological carbon sequestration through microalgae and macrophytes. Focusing on photosynthetic techniques, tolerance mechanisms of carbon assimilation, challenges and perspective of microalgae and macrophytes based carbon sequestration and biomitigation.

TI  - The influence of light and temperature on detritus degradation rates for kelp species with contrasting thermal affinities
AB  - Kelp detritus fuels coastal food webs and may play an important role as a source of organic matter for natural carbon sequestration. Here, we conducted ex situ and in situ manipulations to evaluate the role of temperature and light availability in the breakdown of detrital material. We examined degradation rates of two North Atlantic species with contrasting thermal affinities: the â€˜warm waterâ€™ kelp Laminaria ochroleuca and the â€˜cool waterâ€™ Laminaria hyperborea. Detrital fragments were exposed to different temperatures in controlled conditions and across an in situ gradient of depth, corresponding to light availability. Overall, degradation rates (i.e. changes in Fv/Fm and biomass) were faster under lower light conditions and at higher temperatures, although responses were highly variable between plants and fragments. Crucially, as L. ochroleuca degraded faster than L. hyperborea under some conditions, a climate-driven substitution of the â€˜coolâ€™ for the â€˜warmâ€™ kelp, which has been observed at some locations, will likely increase detritus turnover rates and alter detrital pathways in certain environments. More importantly, ocean warming combined with decreased coastal water quality will likely accelerate kelp detritus decomposition, with potential implications for coastal food webs and carbon cycles.

TI  - On-site concurrent carbon dioxide sequestration from flue gas and calcite formation in ossein effluent by a marine cyanobacterium Phormidium valderianum BDU 20041
AB  - In the recent past, there has been an upsurge in the use of microalgae to capture CO2. Microalgae are the most productive biological systems for generating biomass; they produce much more biomass than terrestrial organisms. In the present study, a cyanobacterium was exploited for combined CO2 capture and ossein effluent treatment. Phormidium valderianum BDU 20041, a non-heterocystous filamentous marine cyanobacterium was grown in an open tank (similar to 550 L) in ossein effluent using flue gas (coal burnt) after cooling. After 10 days with unscrubbed flue gas, the organism's biomass productivity, specific growth rate, CO2 fixation rate, and lipid content were 30 mg L-1 d(-1), 0.10 mu d(-1), 56.4 mg C L-1 d(-1), and 12.74\%, respectively. The predominance of C14 and C18 fatty acids in the total lipid content revealed its suitability as a potential biofuel. Results of this study show that flue gas from a coke oven can be used for mass cultivation of P. valderianum BDU 20041, which efficiently captures CO2 and remediates ossein wastewater. Calcite formation by the organism in effluent was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersion spectroscopy studies. Biomass production employing flue gas coupled with the biomineralization of CO2 in ossein effluent at a point source offers a novel self-sustaining strategy to mitigate CO2 through outdoor cultivation and the subsequent generation of a biodiesel feedstock.

TI  - Future algal biofuels: implications of environmental temperature on production strain selection
AB  - Current and future economic mass production of microalgae or cyanobacteria will require suitable, preferably relatively high, levels of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Most large-scale productions sites, as well as those under development or under consideration, have been located between 40N and 40S raising the possible issue of the algae being periodically, or routinely, subjected to elevated temperatures (> 30 degrees C). The effects of environmental temperatures in the range 8-35 degrees C on the marine, oleaginous model alga Nannochloropsis oculata were assessed. Active growth was observed at all temperatures except 35 degrees C, where cells bleached and died. The implications of elevated temperature regimes were assessed for a variety of potential biofuel producing, biotechnologically relevant freshwater, marine and hyper-saline algae and the implications for their biotechnological exploitability discussed.

TI  - Organic carbon composition and microbial transformation of seagrass meadow and its responses to eutrophication [æµ·è‰åºŠæœ‰æœºç¢³ç»„æˆä¸Žå¾®ç”Ÿç‰©è½¬åŒ–åŠå…¶å¯¹å¯Œè¥å…»åŒ–çš„å“åº”]
AB  - Carbon neutrality is an important concept in global climate change governance. Seagrass beds rank among the most productive autotrophic ecosystems on the planet, and are receiving increasing attention as globally-significant hotspots of organic carbon ("blue carbon") sequestration. The blue carbon stored in seagrass beds has important implications for climate change mitigation. The protection of seagrass beds will also protect their organic carbon sequestration potential, consequently helping to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality. Unfortunately, about 29% of the world's seagrass beds have been destroyed, with a loss rate of 7% a-1 since 1990, mostly due to eutrophication. The organic carbon sequestration potential of seagrass beds could be influenced by the subsequent changes in organic carbon composition, and microbial transformation processes. We systematically reviewed the relevant local and international research to summarize the composition and microbial transformation of organic carbon and its responses to eutrophication. Organic carbon is present in various forms in seagrass beds, and can be roughly divided into primary producer living biomass carbon, litter organic carbon, water organic carbon, and sediment organic carbon according to its storage area. Organic carbon can also be divided into labile organic carbon (LOC), which is susceptible to microbial decomposition, and recalcitrant organic carbon (ROC), which is resistant to microbial decomposition. The total ROC (cellulose and lignin) content in seagrass is present in the range of 153-561 mg/g, and accounts for more than 28.7% of the organic carbon in the seagrass plants. The ROC content of seagrass plants is affected by the species, morphology, tissue and organ types, and climatic zones. In the water column, color dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and neutral sugars are indicators of LOC, while the lignin phenol and humic-like fractions of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) are potential tracers of ROC. The DOM in water can be divided into dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP). The DOC/DON and DOC/DOP ratios are used to reflect DOC lability and microbial bioavailability, with high DON and DOP concentrations indicating high DOC lability. In sediments, extractable organic carbon and microbial biomass carbon are important indicators of LOC, while aromatic hydrocarbons and alkanes are indicative of recalcitrant components. There are significant differences in the sediment organic carbon contents of temperate and tropical regions. Microorganisms play a vital role in the transformation of organic carbon. There are geographic differences in microbial composition, which are mainly influenced by the available habitats and climate zones, but there are no differences between seagrass species within a fine-scale seagrass bed. Different microorganisms have different decomposition capacities. Rstrategist microbes, including Clostridiales and Gammaproteobacteria, are able to rapidly decompose LOC, while kstrategists, such as Verrucomicrobiae and Anaerolinae, can break down the more recalcitrant compounds. There is a succession of r- to k-strategists microbes during the decomposition of fresh organic matter (including fresh seagrass litter, DOC, and SOC). Eutrophication may lead to the transformation of the community structure of primary producers in seagrass beds from seagrass to macroalgae, which will increase the input of labile carbon. This consequently causes an increase in LOC in the plant biomass, water column, and sediments, but a decrease in ROC. The nutrient loading can affect the microbial community structure and enzyme activity, which will affect the microbial transformation of organic carbon. Furthermore, nutrient and LOC inputs may induce a "priming effect" that promotes the remineralization of stored organic carbon. Several future research directions for determining the transformation of seagrass beds and their organic carbon were proposed. (1) Extensive studies of the organic carbon components (LOC and ROC) in seagrass beds are required. (2) There is a need to better understand the composition, function, and gene expression of microbial communities in seagrass beds. (3) The eutrophication mechanisms in microbial communities and the related extracellular enzyme activities need to be determined. (4) The response of the organic matter decomposition process to nutrient loading and the interaction of nutrients and algae need to be studied. There is also a need to strengthen local research on the carbon storage potential of seagrass beds to mitigate global climate change and provide theoretical support for achieving carbon neutrality.

TI  - Sources of Particulate Organic Matter across Mangrove Forests and Adjacent Ecosystems in Different Geomorphic Settings
AB  - Mangrove forests are among the world's most productive ecosystems and provide essential ecosystem services such as global climate regulation through the sequestration of carbon. A detailed understanding of the influence of drivers of ecosystem connectivity (in terms of exchange of suspended particulate organic matter), such as geomorphic setting and carbon stocks, among coastal ecosystems is important for being able to depict carbon dynamics. Here, we compared carbon stocks, CO2 fluxes at the sediment-air interface, concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and suspended particulate organic carbon across a mangrove-seagrass-tidal flat seascape. Using stable isotope signatures of carbon and nitrogen in combination with MixSIAR models, we evaluated the contribution of organic matter from different sources among the different seascape components. Generally, carbon concentration was higher as dissolved organic carbon than as suspended particulate matter. Geomorphic settings of the different locations reflected the contributions to particulate organic matter of the primary producers. For example, the biggest contributors in the riverine location were mangrove trees and terrestrial plants, while in fringing locations oceanic and macroalgal sources dominated. Anthropogenic induced changes at the coastal level (i.e. reduction of mangrove forests area) may affect carbon accumulation dynamics in adjacent coastal ecosystems.

TI  - Highly porous nitrogen-doped seaweed carbon for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries
AB  - Due to its natural abundance, low cost and environmental sustainability, carbon derived from biomass has been widely utilized for energy storage and conversion. Herein, we report a facile strategy to synthesize a hierarchically porous carbon via the pyrolysis of seaweed biomass under inert atmosphere and apply it as a cathode material in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries for the first time. Systematic materials characterization suggests that the seaweed carbon (SWC) is doped with N and displays micro-, meso- and macroporous structures and possesses a high total pore volume of 1.48 cm(3) g(-1) and a high surface area of 1510.71 m(2) g(-1), which is beneficial for encapsulating a large amount of sulfur. The as-obtained SWC-S composite, containing 65.7 wt\% sulfur content, delivered a high initial discharge capacity of 1221.2 mAh g(-1) and retained a capacity of 826.4 mAh g(-1) after 70 cycles at 0.2 C. Additionally, the SWC-S composite produced a reversible capacity of 540.6 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at high rate of 1 C. Compared to the pure sulfur cathode, the SWC-S cathode displays excellent rate capabilities, low polarization and good reaction kinetics, highlighting that this biomass-derived porous carbon is suitable for assembling high-performance Li-S batteries.

TI  - Exploration of the phycoremediation potential of Laminaria digitata towards diflubenzuron, lindane, copper and cadmium in a multitrophic pilot-scale experiment
AB  - The presence of contaminants in aquatic ecosystems can cause serious problems to the environment and marine organisms. This study aims to evaluate the phycoremediation capacity of macroalgae Laminaria digitata for pesticides (diflubenzuron and lindane) and toxic elements (cadmium and copper) in seawater in the presence or absence of mussels. The photosynthetic activity was monitored in the macroalgae to assess its ``physiological status{''}. The results showed that the presence of algae decreased diflubenzuron concentration in mussels by 70\% after 120 h of exposure. Additionally, this macroalgae was efficient to reduce lindane, Cu and Cd in seawater; even though it not was able to reduce these contaminants in mussels. The studied pollutants did not affect the physiological status of macroalgae. This study reveals that the application of phycoremediation with macroalgae can be an useful and effective mitigation strategy to remove/decrease contaminant levels from the aquatic environment.

TI  - Environmental assessment of co-location alternatives for a microalgae cultivation plant: a case study in the city of Kingston (Canada)
AB  - In recent years there has been growing interest in the use of microalgae as a feedstock for biofuels, particularly for biodiesel. The production process of biodiesel from microalgae generally consists of five different phases: cultivation, harvesting, drying, lipid extraction and transesterification. While existing technologies are available to undertake each of these phases, the process would benefit from enhanced sustainability achieved by reducing environmental impact and costs. One process innovation currently under consideration is the use of waste products as inputs to the process, including CO2 captured from industrial flue gas, or nutrients from wastewater. These could be employed in algae cultivation. The co-location of an algae cultivation plant with other industrial facilities, such as a cement plant or a wastewater treatment facility, could result in significantly reduced atmospheric emissions and improve wastewater effluent discharges. A comparative life cycle assessment approach is used to examine two different, realistic alternatives for the co-location of an algae cultivation plant with an existing cement plant or wastewater treatment facility near Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The study seeks to identify a preferred siting option from the perspective of minimizing environmental impacts. The first alternative involves the co-location with the Lafarge Cement plant, on the north shore of Lake Ontario, near Bath Ontario. The second alternative consists in the co-location with the Ravensview wastewater treatment facility east of the city of Kingston on the St. Lawrence River. The algae production plant is based on an open pond technology and is assumed to have a production capacity of about 120 tons of dry microalgal biomass per year. (C) 2016 The Authors.

TI  - Solar intervention in bioenergy
AB  - Research interest in the integration of solar energy-harvesting technology with bioenergy production is growing at a remarkable pace. The time of fruition of a completely off-grid solar-powered refinery facility is not too far, at least in the specific instance of bioenergy sources, namely, biodiesel and bioethanol. Electricity generated from solar panels is used for the cultivation of microalgae in outdoor open ponds. The solar thermal energy is converted into electricity by solar panels, and the electricity is stored in lead-acid batteries that are used to power the motors to rotate the agitator blades for stirring the contents of the algal culture. The biomass productivity of outdoor open ponds completely powered by solar energy (5.8gm2/d of Nannochloropsis oceanica SCS-1981) is on par with the traditional raceway ponds. Such innovation in harvesting microalgae has led to energy savings and cost reduction. A solar energy-driven biodiesel production process using waste cooking oil as feedstock catalyzed by SrO solid base catalyst supported on activated carbon was found to yield 98.5wt.% fatty acid methyl ester (FAME, biodiesel) in 60min at 46Â°C upon direct exposure of the reaction vessel to sunlight. The integration of solar energy with biodiesel production resulted in economically viable production strategies ($0.73, 0.54, and 1.27/L of biodiesel from palm oil, rapeseed oil, and Chlorella vulgaris, respectively). Solar energy is used for the downstream biodiesel purification process, that is, distillation facilitating recovery of alcohol used in the transesterification of lipids used for biodiesel production. Alcohol recovery of as high as 41kg/m2/24h was achieved in the membrane-assisted solar-driven distillation process. A completely off-grid solar thermal energy-powered bioethanol production process from coastal hay and cane sugar was found to yield 0.474 and 0.05 mole fractions of bioethanol, respectively. In the first-ever report, bioethanol concentration of up to 18wt. % was produced from the aqueous glucose (40wt. %) feedstock in a completely solar-powered fermentation reactor operated on a unique evaporation-condensation process powered by solar energy. Bioethanol (8.7wt.%) produced in a solar fermenter was successfully used as fuel for operating an alkaline-acid direct ethanol fuel cell at 303K with current and power density values of 700mA/cm and 330mW/cm, respectively, and an open-circuit voltage of 1.65V. Nanotechnology is effectively used for harnessing solar thermal energy, which is subsequently used for driving vital processes involved in biodiesel (harvesting of microalgae, lipid extraction, esterification of free fatty acids, transesterification of triglycerides, purification of biodiesel) and bioethanol (pretreatment, cellulose hydrolysis, fermentation and distillation of aqueous ethanol) production processes. Nanoparticles such as multiwalled carbon nanotubes (with high thermal conductivity) and MgO (high specific heat capacity) and Au-nanoshells (photothermal conversion) were exploited for the effective harnessing of solar energy. A unique fusion of advanced technologies, namely nanotechnology, solar technology, and biochemical technology, is on the verge of a breakthrough leading to energy sustainability with reduced emission of pollutants. Many such path-breaking innovations are awaited in the realm of biomass conversion to bioenergy by integrating bioenergy production processes with solar technology. Specific examples of many such smart technologies are summarized in this chapter by scanning 40 yearsâ€™ worth of literature (1980-2020) in the realm of solar energy and bioenergy.

TI  - Forensic carbon accounting: Assessing the role of seaweeds for carbon sequestration
AB  - Carbon sequestration is defined as the secure storage of carbon-containing molecules for >100 years, and in the context of carbon dioxide removal for climate mitigation, the origin of this CO2 is from the atmosphere. On land, trees globally sequester substantial amounts of carbon in woody biomass, and an analogous role for seaweeds in ocean carbon sequestration has been suggested. The purposeful expansion of natural seaweed beds and aquaculture systems, including into the open ocean (ocean afforestation), has been proposed as a method of increasing carbon sequestration and use in carbon trading and offset schemes. However, to verify whether CO2 fixed by seaweeds through photosynthesis leads to carbon sequestration is extremely complex in the marine environment compared to terrestrial systems, because of the need to jointly consider: the comparatively rapid turnover of seaweed biomass, tracing the fate of carbon via particulate and dissolved organic carbon pathways in dynamic coastal waters, and the key role of atmosphere-ocean CO2 exchange. We propose a Forensic Carbon Accounting approach, in which a thorough analysis of carbon flows between the atmosphere and ocean, and into and out of seaweeds would be undertaken, for assessing the magnitude of CO2 removal and robust attribution of carbon sequestration to seaweeds.

TI  - Seawater desalination concentrate for cultivation of Dunaliella salina with floating photobioreactor to produce beta-carotene
AB  - Using seawater desalination concentrate to produce microalgae biomass enriched with high value products is a promising way to improve the profitability of desalination industry, but this is seriously limited by enormous land requirement for microalgae farming, as well as high cost of microalgae cultivation. In this study, low cost floating photobioreactor was adopted to cultivate Dunaliella salina to produce beta-carotene, using seawater desalination concentrate as culture medium. With carbonate precipitate pretreatment, 97.6\% Ca2+ and 60.3\% Mg2+ were removed from seawater desalination concentrate. Then, this carbonate enriched medium was bubbled with CO2, to generate bicarbonate, and this increased total inorganic carbon to 0.254 mol(-1). Cultivation with this medium resulted in biomass production without difference from optimized concentrated artificial seawater medium. Pilot scale cultivation of D. salina with floating PBR on ocean showed that 300 g algal biomass containing 14.3 g beta-carotene can be produced from 1 m(3) desalination concentrate. This amount of beta-carotene enriched biomass has a value more than \$ 40, and would significantly improve the profitability of desalination industry.

TI  - Membrane-mediated delivery of carbon dioxide for consumption by photoautotrophs: Eliminating thermal regeneration in carbon capture
AB  - Photoautotrophs, such as microalgae and cyanobacteria, use sunlight to convert inorganic carbon, especially dissolved CO 2 and bicarbonates, to organic materials, commonly biofuels or biofuel precursors. For large-scale biofuel production, the CO 2 abundance in ambient air is not sufficient and CO 2 must be delivered in a concentrated form, ideally captured from anthropogenic sources such as flue gas streams from power plants. Carbon dioxide capture and delivery to the photoautotrophic culture can add significantly to the cost of biofuels. Much of that cost can be attributed to the regeneration of the CO 2 sorbent, a generally energy intensive process. Herein, a liquid-based CO 2 delivery methodology is described and demonstrated. The system involves a conventional CO 2 sorption system (exemplified by an amine-functionalized sorbent), and a carbonate stripping solution that produces a bicarbonate-rich solution after contacting the absorber. The latter solution serves as the feed stream for a CO 2 selective membrane with the permeate side of the membrane being swept by a seawater solution, designed as a model for a photoautotrophic culture medium. Changes in pH and carbon content of the solutions, as well as the lack of any ionic transport across the membrane, are consistent with molecular transport of CO 2. The CO 2 flux is shown to be consistent with the chemical potential differential provided by the carbon-rich stripping solution and the carbon-depleted seawater solution. In application to biofuel production, the driving force would be sustained by carbon consumption in the photosynthetic process. Thus, photosynthesis provides much of the energy for the CO 2 sorbent regeneration in the form of the regenerated carbonate stripping solution. The overall liquid-based CO 2 delivery process described here provides the potential for a more cost-effective biofuel production process. Â© 2012 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Seaweed for climate mitigation, wastewater treatment, bioenergy, bioplastic, biochar, food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics: a review
AB  - The development and recycling of biomass production can partly solve issues of energy,Â climate change, population growth, food and feed shortages, and environmental pollution. For instance, the use of seaweeds as feedstocks can reduce our reliance on fossil fuel resources, ensure the synthesis of cost-effective and eco-friendly products and biofuels, and develop sustainableÂ biorefineryÂ processes. Nonetheless, seaweeds use in several biorefineries is still in the infancy stage compared toÂ terrestrial plants-based lignocellulosic biomass. Therefore, here we review seaweed biorefineries with focus on seaweed production, economical benefits, and seaweed use as feedstock for anaerobic digestion, biochar, bioplastics, crop health, food, livestock feed, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Globally, seaweeds could sequester between 61 and 268 megatonnes of carbon per year, with an average of 173 megatonnes. Nearly 90% of carbon is sequestered by exporting biomass to deep water, while the remaining 10% is buried in coastal sediments. 500 gigatonnes of seaweeds could replace nearly 40% of the current soy protein production. Seaweeds contain valuable bioactive molecules that could be applied as antimicrobial, antioxidant, antiviral, antifungal, anticancer, contraceptive, anti-inflammatory, anti-coagulants, and in other cosmetics and skincare products.

TI  - Effects of light intensity on the photosynthetic responses of Sargassum fusiforme seedlings to future CO2 rising
AB  - Mariculture of the economically important seaweed will likely be affected by the combined conditions of ocean acidification that resulting from increasing CO2 rising and decreased light levels, especially under high culture intensity and high biomass accumulation. To examine this coupling effect on the photosynthetic performance of Sargassum fusiforme seedlings, we cultured seedlings of this alga under different light and CO2 levels. Under low light conditions, elevated CO2 significantly decreased the photosynthesis of S. fusiforme seedlings, including a decreased photosynthetic electron transport rate. Seedlings grown under the low light intensity exhibited higher photosynthetic rates and compensation irradiance, and displayed higher photosynthetic pigment contents and light absorption than seedlings grown under high light intensity, providing strong evidence of photosynthetic acclimation to low light. However, the captured light and energy were insufficient to support photosynthesis in acidified seawater regardless of increased dissolved inorganic carbon, resulting in declined carbohydrate and biomass accumulation. This indicated that S. fusiforme photosynthesis was more sensitive to acidified seawater in its early growth stage, and strongly affected by light intensity. Future research should evaluate the practical manipulation of biomass accumulation and mariculture densities during the early culture period at the CO2 level predicted for the end of the century.

TI  - Algal diversity and their importance in ecological processes in typical mangrove ecosystems
AB  - Algae are important flora in mangrove ecosystems. Algae can be divided into three ecological groups, namely phytoplankton, benthic microalgae, and macroalgae in mangrove ecosystems, which play important roles in organic carbon production and nutrient cycle. Despite the importance of algae for ecosystem function, studies of mangrove ecosystems have focused on higher plants and animals, with few studies of algae. Due to their abundance in mangrove ecosystems, studies of algae can broaden our understanding about the structure and function of mangrove ecosystems. In this review, we first briefly introduce algal groups and their ecological importance in mangrove ecosystems. Then, we emphasize species composition and geographical distribution of phytoplankton, benthic diatoms and macroalgae, and their importance in key ecological processes such as primary production, water pollution, element cycle, and carbon stock dynamics in mangrove ecosystem. The researches have showed that the species number of phytoplankton and benthic diatoms in mangroves varied from dozens to hundreds, and diatoms are dominant both in species composition and abundance, which are important primary producer, animal food, and pollution indicator. Macroalgae are mainly composed of red algae, green algae, brown algae and blue-green algae. Green algae are dominant in species richness whereas red algae are abundant in quantity. Algae contribute significantly to the carbon pool by sequestering and cycling carbon. We propose that future studies should focus on algal diversity and its role in ecological processes in mangrove ecosystems. Furthermore, we suggest that studies of algae should be part of comprehensive investigations on long-term ecosystem dynamics. The influence of continental runoff and tidal patterns on algal diversity and blue carbon dynamics in mangrove areas also deserve more attention, on account of being directly related to nutrient replenishment and dynamics. Since algal diversity in mangrove sediment is influenced by physico-chemical and biological condition of the system, it could be used as an indicator of climate change and effects of anthropogenic activity on mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - STUDY ON ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION TECHNOLOGY OF MACROALGAE BASED ON SPORE ADHESION FUNCTION
AB  - To find an effective, economical and sustainable way of macroalgae artificial transplantation, a study based on the adhesive properties of spore tested several food additives in April, 2020. These adhesive mixtures were mixed with S. horneri spore and applied on the reef both inside and outside the laboratory. After observing the attachment, germination and growth situation of spore, the optimal adhesive was picked out. Meanwhile, the study of low temperature preservation of macroalgae spore extended the cycle of macroalgae artificial transplantation. Our results showed that: (1) algin[(C6H7O6Na)n] was a better adhesive. Higher viscosity and higher volume guaranteed better protection against current and dilution, which helps to better attachment of spore. Adhesive mixture of S. horneri spore applied on the reef survived well in subtidal zone, with a survival density of 278 ind./m2. However, only those sites with less exposure to wave and current had a good effect of transplantation in the intertidal zone. (2) Low temperature preservation of macroalgae spore prolonged the cycle of macroalgae artificial transplantation. Zygote of S. horneri preserved at (7Â±3)â„ƒ still have adhesive ability after 23 days. This adhesion had a better result against current scour. (3) The spore mucus technology can be widely used in macroalgae spore artificial breeding and transplantation. This technology covered lab spore mucus uniform spray skill, water surface spore mucus spray transplantation skill, tidal zone spore mucus uniform spray skill, subtidal zone spore mucus daub skill, and artificial reefs or algal reefs spore mucus uniform spray transplantation skill. The research provided a new way to transplant macroalgae, and will contribute to the development of adhesive exploit, spray method and facilities.

AB  - Biofules are considered as culprits for damaging biodiversity, despite being very helpful in cutting greenhouse gas emissions and reducing dependence on imported fuels. Algae, ranging from single-celled microalgae to large seaweeds, are the simplest and most abundant form of plant life, responsible for more than half of the world's primary production. Chevron has formed a partnership with Californian firm Solazyme, which is transferring its expertise in genetically-modified algae for pharmaceuticals production into biodiesel. Another company, San Francisco-based Sapphire Energy, has attracted investors including the Wellcome Trust for its technology, which uses genetically transformed microalgae to produce what it claims is 'green crude', a mixture of hydrocarbons that can be processed in the same way as crude oil. One of Sapphire's innovations is to genetically engineer pesticide resistance into its algae so they can be grown in an open pond with some pesticide to kill off unwanted species.

TI  - Towards Incorporation of Blue Carbon in Falkland Islands Marine Spatial Planning: A Multi-Tiered Approach
AB  - Ecosystem-based conservation that includes carbon sinks, alongside a linked carbon credit system, as part of a nature-based solution to combating climate change, could help reduce greenhouse gas levels and therefore the impact of their emissions. Blue carbon habitats and pathways can also facilitate biodiversity retention, aiding sustainable fisheries and island economies. However, robust blue carbon research is often limited at the scale of regional governance and management, lacking both incentives and facilitation of policy-integration. The remote and highly biodiverse coastal ecosystems and surrounding continental shelf can be used to better inform long-term ecosystem-based management in the vast South Atlantic Ocean and sub-Antarctic, to synergistically protect both unique biodiversity and inform on the magnitude of nature-based benefits they provide. Understanding key ecosystem information such as their location, extent, and condition of habitat types, will be critical in understanding carbon pathways to sequestration, threats to this, and vulnerability. This paper considers the current status of blue carbon data and information available, and what is still required before blue carbon can be used as a conservation management tool integrated in national Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) initiatives. Our research indicates that the data and information gathered has enabled baselines for a number of different blue carbon ecosystems, and indicated potential threats and vulnerability that need to be managed. However, significant knowledge gaps remain across habitats, such as salt marsh, mudflats and the mesophotic zones, which hinders meaningful progress on the ground where it is needed most.

TI  - Sequestration of macroalgal carbon: the elephant in the Blue Carbon room
AB  - Macroalgae form the most extensive and productive benthic marine vegetated habitats globally but their inclusion in Blue Carbon (BC) strategies remains controversial. We review the arguments offered to reject or include macroalgae in the BC framework, and identify the challenges that have precluded macroalgae from being incorporated so far. Evidence that macroalgae support significant carbon burial is compelling. The carbon they supply to sediment stocks in angiosperm BC habitats is already included in current assessments, so that macroalgae are de facto recognized as important donors of BC. The key challenges are (i) documenting macroalgal carbon sequestered beyond BC habitat, (ii) tracing it back to source habitats, and (iii) showing that management actions at the habitat lead to increased sequestration at the sink site. These challenges apply equally to carbon exported from BC coastal habitats. Because of the large carbon sink they support, incorporation of macroalgae into BC accounting and actions is an imperative. This requires a paradigm shift in accounting procedures as well as developing methods to enable the capacity to trace carbon from donor to sink habitats in the ocean.

TI  - Response of a natural phytoplankton community from the Qingdao coast (Yellow Sea, China) to variable CO2 revels over a short-term incubation experiment
AB  - Since marine phytoplankton play a vital role in stabilizing earth's climate by removing significant amount of atmospheric CO2, their responses to increasing CO2 levels are indeed vital to address. The responses of a natural phytoplankton community from the Qingdao coast (NW Yellow Sea, China) was studied under different CO2 levels in microcosms. HPLC pigment analysis revealed the presence of diatoms as a dominant microalgal group; however, members of chlorophytes, prasinophytes, cryptophytes and cyanophytes were also present. delta C-13(POM) values indicated that the phytoplankton community probably utilized bicarbonate ions as dissolved inorganic carbon source through a carbon concentration mechanism (CCM) under low CO2 levels, and diffusive CO2 uptake increased upon the increase of external CO2 levels. Although, considerable increase in phytoplankton biomass was noticed in all CO2 treatments, CO2-induced effects were absent. Higher net nitrogen uptake under low CO2 levels could be related to the synthesis of CCM components. Flow cytometry analysis showed slight reduction in the abundance of Synechococcus and pico-eukaryotes under the high CO2 treatments. Diatoms did not show any negative impact in response to increasing CO2 levels; however, chlorophytes revealed a reverse tend. Heterotrophic bacterial count enhanced with increasing CO2 levels and indicated higher abundance of labile organic carbon. Thus, the present study indicates that any change in dissolved CO2 concentrations in this area may affect phytoplankton physiology and community structure and needs further long-term study.

TI  - Using marine microalgae strains for oil removal from oil-water emulsion remediation
AB  - Emulsified oils are considered major environmental hazards. Biological treatment of these contaminants, using bacteria, is very effective, but the produced biomass does not have any obvious value. If oils can be removed by microalgae, the produced biomass in this case can be readily used to produce lipids that can be used for biodiesel production. The ability of two marine strains, namely Nannochloropsis sp. and Tetraselmis sp. to grow in water containing emulsified oil has been tested. The effectiveness of the selected strains to utilize the organics as a carbon source and reduce their concentration has also been assessed. The oil removal efficiency and cells growth rates were evaluated. Under the tested condition, the two strains were able to grow and reduce the oil concentration equally well, with Nannochloropsis sp. performing slightly better. The positive outputs from this work benefit the energy and wastewater treatment sectors..

TI  - Shellfish and seaweed mariculture increase atmospheric CO2 absorption by coastal ecosystems
AB  - With an annual production of > 10 million t (Mt), China is the largest producer of cultivated shellfish and seaweeds in the world. Through mariculture of shellfish and seaweeds, it is estimated that 3.79 +/- 0.37 Mt C yr(-1) are being taken up, and 1.20 +/- 0.11 Mt C yr(-1) are being removed from the coastal ecosystem by harvesting (means +/- SD). These estimates are based on carbon content data of both shellfish and seaweeds and annual production data from 1999 to 2008. The result illustrates that cultivated shellfish and seaweeds can indirectly and directly take up a significant volume of coastal ocean carbon-shellfish accomplish this by removal of phytoplankton and particulate organic matter through filter feeding, and seaweeds through photosynthesis. Thus, cultivation of seaweeds and shellfish plays an important role in carbon fixation, and therefore contributes to improving the capacity of coastal ecosystems to absorb atmospheric CO2. Because the relationship between mariculture and the carbon cycle of the coastal ecosystem is complicated and the interaction between the 2 processes is significant, such studies should be continued and given high priority.

TI  - Biomass and carbon storage of Sargassum sp. in Poncan Gadang Island, North Sumatera Province
AB  - One of the efforts made to reduce the increase in CO2 is to use coastal vegetation such as macroalgae. This research was conducted in Poncan Gadang island, North Sumatera. The purpose of this research is to know the density and biomass of macroalgae Sargassum sp. and to estimate carbon storage in the macroalgae Sargassum sp. in the waters of Poncan Gadang island. The results showed that the biomass and carbon stores in Sargassum sp. are quite large and varied from 2.82 kg C m-2, 4.80 kg C m-2, and 4.63 kg C m-2 in every sampling point with an average of 4.08 kg C m-2. This means Sargassum sp. has the potential in mitigating climate change through carbon sequestration. Differences in the value of carbon stored in the biomass of Sargassum sp. are affected by biomass density and different carbon content at each sampling point due to environmental conditions.

TI  - Seaweed-based natural ingredients: Stability of phlorotannins during extraction, storage, passage through the gastrointestinal tract and potential incorporation into functional foods
AB  - Adding value to seaweed by extracting their different bioactive compounds and incorporating them into foods represent an interesting and strategic approach to diversify the functional foods offer. However, once harvested, fresh seaweed must overcome a sequence of crucial steps to confer their biological activity. Pre-processing operations and extraction processes, as well as long-term storage, play important roles in improving or decreasing the phlorotannins content. In their way to the gut (biological target), phlorotannins are exposed to the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT), where the physiological pH and digestive enzymes can significantly affect the phlorotannins' stability and thus, alter their biological activity. Besides, the subsequent incorporation into foodstuffs could be limited due to sensory issues, as tannins have been associated with astringency and bitter taste, and thus effective phlorotannins doses may negatively affect the sensory attributes of foods. These drawbacks expose the need of applying smart strategies to develop a final product providing the necessary protective mechanisms to maintain the active molecular form of phlorotannins up to the consumption time, also controlling their release upon arrival to the gut. In this context, the impact of these technological processes (from pre-processing to the passage through the GIT) on phlorotannins stability, as well as the innovative developed approaches to overcome these issues will be deeply discussed in this review. Besides, recent findings related to the phlorotannins' health benefits will be pointed out. Special attention on the potential incorporation of phlorotannins into functional foods will be also put it on.

TI  - Effects of CO2 enrichment on two microalgae species: A toxicity approach using consecutive generations
AB  - As a result of the increasing pressure provoked by anthropogenic activities, the world climate is changing and oceans health is in danger. One of the most important factors affecting the marine environment is the well-known process called ocean acidification. Also, there are other natural or anthropogenic processes that produce an enrichment of CO2 in the marine environment (CO2 leakages from Carbon Capture and Storage technologies (CCS), organic matter diagenesis, volcanic vents, etc). Most of the studies related to acidification of the marine environment by enrichment of CO2 have been focused on short-term experiments. To evaluate the effects related to CO2 enrichment, laboratory-scale experiments were performed using the marine microalgae Tetraselmis chuii and Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Three different pH values (two treatments - pH 7.4 and 6.0 - and a control - pH 8.0) were tested on the selected species across four consecutive generations. Seawater was collected and exposed to different scenarios of CO2 enrichment by means of CO2 injection. The results showed different effects depending on the species and the generation used. Effects on T. chuii were shown on cell density, chlorophyll-a and metabolic activity, however, a slight adaptation across generations was found in this last parameter. P. tricornutum was more sensitive to acidification conditions through generations, with practically total growth inhibition in the fourth one. The conclusions obtained in this work are useful to address the potential ecological risk related to acidification by enrichment of CO2 on the marine ecosystem by using consecutive generations of microalgae.

TI  - Advances in energy research
AB  - In this compilation, the authors develop a modeling approach and formulate global equations. The data is based on the thermos-economic theory that uses the thermodynamic process of cost formation and that considers the direct and indirect effects of all components of every system in each cited field. The relations between the incomes and impacts of the use of energy in all sectors with different systems are discussed, and characteristic equations representing each physical behavior of every plant in the system and its impact will be formulated. The Nigeria energy situation is reviewed in order to identify potential sites of SHPs and how small hydropower fits in as the solution to the country sustainable energy challenge. Issues of small hydropower resource availability, technology, environment and climate change have been also discussed. Following this, an overview of industrial systems of oxycombustion integrated in microalgal photobioreactors is provided. The authors discuss issues related to carbon capture technologies, the science and technology of the oxycombustion, the biological oxygen generation, the photobioreactors and the process integration, summarizing a range of useful strategies directed to the industrial sustainable development. The development process for harvesting marine energy for local small-scale usage is described; marine energy has received much attention globally and is being developed as a viable source of renewable energy. While high tidal and fast water current would yield large energy generation, not all locations possess these advantages. With different limitations for specific site locations, this study suggests that micro-scale marine turbine may be suitable for areas with low tidal velocity. Continuing, a review is provided which describes recent approaches adopted to engineer nanostructured electrocatalytic materials for efficient mass transport of reactants and products, high conductivity and activity for electrochemical CO2 reduction into value-added chemicals or intermediates. The current state of integration of Big Data, Data Mining and Artificial Intelligence techniques in advanced Energy Systems Optimization is also examined. A comprehensive review of relevant Artificial Intelligence techniques applicable to the optimization of DER is described, in addition to a review of relevant software needed to model advanced DERs.

TI  - Geoengineering, marine microalgae, and climate stabilization in the 21st century
AB  - Society has set ambitious targets for stabilizing mean global temperature. To attain these targets, it will have to reduce CO2 emissions to near zero by mid-century and subsequently remove CO2 from the atmosphere during the latter half of the century. There is a recognized need to develop technologies for CO2 removal; however, attempts to develop direct air-capture systems have faced both energetic and financial constraints. Recently, BioEnergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) has emerged as a leading candidate for removing CO2 from the atmosphere. However, BECCS can have negative consequences on land, nutrient, and water use as well as biodiversity and food production. Here, we describe an alternative approach based on the large-scale industrial production of marine microalgae. When cultivated with proper attention to power, carbon, and nutrient sources, microalgae can be processed to produce a variety of biopetroleum products, including carbon-neutral biofuels for the transportation sector and long-lived, potentially carbon-negative construction materials for the built environment. In addition to these direct roles in mitigating and potentially reversing the effects of fossil CO2 emissions, microalgae can also play an important indirect role. As microalgae exhibit much higher primary production rates than terrestrial plants, they require much less land area to produce an equivalent amount of bioenergy and/or food. On a global scale, the avoided emissions resulting from displacement of conventional agriculture may exceed the benefits of microalgae biofuels in achieving the climate stabilization goals.

TI  - Diatoms Si uptake capacity drives carbon export in coastal upwelling systems
AB  - Coastal upwelling systems account for approximately half of global ocean primary production and contribute disproportionately to biologically driven carbon sequestration. Diatoms, silica-precipitating microalgae, constitute the dominant phytoplankton in these productive regions, and their abundance and assemblage composition in the sedimentary record is considered one of the best proxies for primary production. The study of the sedimentary diatom abundance (SDA) and total organic carbon content (TOC) in the five most important coastal upwelling systems of the modern ocean (Iberia-Canary, Benguela, Peru-Humboldt, California, and Somalia-Oman) reveals a global-scale positive relationship between diatom production and organic carbon burial. The analysis of SDA in conjunction with environmental variables of coastal upwelling systems such as upwelling strength, satellite-derived net primary production, and surface water nutrient concentrations shows different relations between SDA and primary production on the regional scale. On the global scale, SDA appears modulated by the capacity of diatoms to take up silicic acid, which ultimately sets an upper limit to global export production in these ocean regions.

TI  - Quantitative modeling of microalgae based sequestration of atmospheric CO2
AB  - Marine microalgae have been identified as a considerable sink of atmospheric CO2. Since macroscopic ecosystems cannot be studied experimentally with the required microscopic spatial resolution, a novel modeling method is being presented to quantify this sequestration process. The presented modeling studies indicate that the fixation of carbon by microalgae is species-specific and depends on competition effects among multiple species.

TI  - Potential applications of nuisance microalgae blooms
AB  - Algal blooms have become a major concern in coastal areas and the great lakes of the world. Because of their various consequences for aquatic ecosystems and resources, algal blooms are called ``harmful algal blooms{''} (HABs). HABs often become severely detrimental when they involve one or more toxin-producing microalgae of various taxonomic origins. The accumulation of algal biomass also has deleterious effects on the ecological status of water. However, appropriate management strategies can allow the beneficial utilization of these events by consuming the biomass feedstock in the production of valuable biocommodities, including biofuels, functional food ingredients, UV-absorbing compounds, pharmaceutical products, etc. However, if the algal biomass can be harvested prior to the onset of their death phase, nutrients (carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) can also be removed from the ecosystem by harvesting the algal blooms. Great progress has been made in the last decade in monitoring and predicting HABs, and a demand is emerging for persuasive postevent management policies that focus on the potential utilization of these blooms as natural renewable bioresources. This review summarizes various potential applications of nuisance algal blooms and the need for scientific research into their economic and industrial potential. Major algal products with great ecological and economic significance and their contemporary global utilization are analyzed.

TI  - Biomass and carbon storage of Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis (Rhodophyta) in Zhanshan Bay, Qingdao, China
AB  - Marine macroalgae can absorb carbon and play an important role in carbon sequestration. As an important economic macroalga, Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis has the potential to significantly affect carbon absorption and storage in wave-sheltered intertidal reef systems. However, detailed knowledge on seasonal biomass changes and carbon storage of G. lemaneiformis is lacking, especially in many small and scattered ecosystems. Considering the influence of human activities on wild distribution of G. lemaneiformis, the understanding of seasonal dynamics of an economically important species in nature is necessary. In this study, we first investigated seasonal variations in biomass, coverage area, and carbon storage during low tide from August 2011 to July 2012 in Zhanshan Bay, Qingdao, China. Furthermore, we estimated the carbon storage potential of wild G. lemaneiformis using light use efficiency (LUE). The results show that the standing biomass and coverage area changed significantly with season. However, seasonal variations in carbon content and water content were not obvious, with an average content of 35.1\% and 83.64\%, respectively. Moreover, carbon storage in individual months varied between 0.67 and 47.03 g C/m(2), and the value of carbon storage was the highest in August and June and the lowest in February. In Zhanshan Bay, LUE of G. lemaneiformis was only 0.23\%. If it is increased to the theoretical maximum (5\%-6\%), the carbon storage will have an increase of at least 21 times compared with the current, which suggested that carbon storage of wild G. lemaneiformis had a high enhancement potential. The study will help to assess a potential role of G. lemaneiformis in reducing atmospheric CO2.

TI  - Optimizing microalgae cultivation and wastewater treatment in large-scale offshore photobioreactors
AB  - Algae Systems LLC has designed and implemented a novel approach to wastewater treatment in which municipal wastewater is used to cultivate microalgae in modular, offshore photobioreactors (PBRs). At the Algae Systems plant in Daphne AL, this process was used to treat up to 50,000 gal/day of incoming raw wastewater. A combination of algae nutrient uptake, aeration by photosynthetically produced oxygen, and dewatering via suspended air flotation removed 75\% of total nitrogen, 93\% of total phosphorus and 92\% BOD from influent wastewater. Offshore PBRs contained evolving polycultures of microalgae and associated heterotrophs, with community composition shifting based on the dynamic external and internal environment. During one year of operation, microalgae composition shifted from dominance of Scenedesmus dimorphus to a diverse polyculture dominated by genus Chlorella, Cryptomonas and Scenedesmus. ``The more, the merrier{''} approach to species richness produced resilient communities, enabling efficient nutrient uptake due to niche complementarity and eliminating process downtime due to biological disruptions. The resulting biomass was suitable for fuel conversion via hydrothermal liquefaction due to consistent lipid content, low ash content, and consistent elemental composition. Biomass production rates ranged from 3.5 to 22.7 g/m(2)/day during continuous operation, with productivity predominantly driven by temperature and frequency of harvest. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Selection of microalgae and cyanobacteria strains for bicarbonate-based integrated carbon capture and algae production system
AB  - Using microalgae to capture CO2 from flue gas is an ideal way to reduce CO2 emission, but this is challenged by the high cost of carbon capture and transportation. To address this problem, a bicarbonate-based integrated carbon capture and algae production system (BICCAPS) has been proposed, in which bicarbonate is used for algae culture, and the regenerated carbonate from this process can be used to capture more CO2. High-concentration bicarbonate is obligate for the BICCAPS. Thus, different strains of microalgae and cyanobacteria were tested in this study for their capability to grow in high-concentration NaHCO3. The highest NaHCO3 concentrations they are tolerant to were determined as 0.30 M for Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, 0.60 M for Cyanothece sp.; 0.10 M for Chlorella sorokiniana, 0.60 M for Dunaliella salina, and 0.30 M for Dunaliella viridis and Dunaliella primolecta. In further study, biomass production from culture of D. primolecta in an Erlenmeyer flask with either 0.30 M NaHCO3 or 2 % CO2 bubbling was compared, and no significant difference was detected. This indicates BICCAPS can reach the same biomass productivity as regular CO2 bubbling culture, and it is promising for future application. Â© 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - Algae as biofuel
AB  - The combustion of fossil fuels contributes to climate change by introducing greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, and the need for an alternative fuel source is increasingly important. Biomass, either terrestrial or aquatic is considered a potential renewable energy source for biofuel production. Microalgae or seaweed (Macroalgae) are considered superior compared with terrestrial plants - in terms of solar energy storage, nutrient assimilation and potential for biofuel production - due to their higher photosynthetic efficiency, higher biomass yield and rates. The use of algae for biofuel production is expected to play an important role in securing energy supply in the next decades. For example, not only in the processing of those algae directly related to biofuels production but also in the possibility of combining this processing with pollution control, in particular with biological sequestration of CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gases, or wastewater treatment. Energy from biomass (biological, including biofuels and non-biological processes including gasification, combustion, and so on) is expected to provide more than a half share of the total energy to achieve the desired target. The various aspects associated with the design of algae production units are described in this paper, giving an overview of the current state of development of algae cultivation systems (photo-bioreactors and open ponds). Other potential applications and products from microalgae are also presented in this paper - for example applications in teh biological sequestration of CO2 and in wastewater treatment. In addition, the use of microalgae as food additives and for aquaculture is also discussed. Â© 2015 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Dynamic metabolic profiling of the marine microalga Chlamydomonas sp JSC4 and enhancing its oil production by optimizing light intensity
AB  - Background: Marine microalgae are among the most promising lipid sources for biodiesel production because they can be grown on nonarable land without the use of potable water. Marine microalgae also harvest solar energy efficiently with a high growth rate, converting CO2 into lipids stored in the cells. Both light intensity and nitrogen availability strongly affect the growth, lipid accumulation, and fatty acid composition of oleaginous microalgae. However, very few studies have systematically examined how to optimize lipid productivity by adjusting irradiance intensity, and the metabolic dynamics that may lead to improved lipid accumulation in microalgae have not been elucidated. Little is known about the mechanism of lipid synthesis regulation in microalgae. Moreover, few studies have assessed the potential of using marine microalgae as oil producers. Results: In this work, a newly isolated marine microalga, Chlamydomonas sp. JSC4, was selected as a potential lipid producer, and the effect of photobioreactor operations on cell growth and lipid production was investigated. The combined effects of light intensity and nitrogen depletion stresses on growth and lipid accumulation were further explored in an effort to markedly improve lipid production and quality. The optimal lipid productivity and content attained were 312 mg L-1 d(-1) and 43.1\% per unit dry cell weight, respectively. This lipid productivity is the highest ever reported for marine microalgae. Metabolic intermediates were profiled over time to observe transient changes during lipid accumulation triggered by combined stresses. Finally, metabolite turnover was also assessed using an in vivo C-13-labeling technique to directly measure the flow of carbon during lipid biosynthesis under stress associated with light intensity and nitrogen deficiency. Conclusions: This work demonstrates the synergistic integration of cultivation and dynamic metabolic profiling technologies to develop a simple and effective strategy for enhancing oil production in a marine microalga. The knowledge obtained from this study could be useful in assessing the feasibility of marine microalgae biodiesel production and for understanding the links between dynamic metabolic profiles and lipid biosynthesis during the course of microalgal cultivation.

TI  - Microalgae cultivation using biogas and digestate carbon sources
AB  - Anaerobic digestion produces biogas and digestate containing CO2 and volatile fatty acids, respectively that might need to be removed if they are to be used or discharged. Algae cultivation would remove the carbon in biogas and digestate. The present work used a textile desizing wastewater digester's biogas and digestate effluent to cultivate microalgae Scenedesmus sp. The tested biogas CO2 and digestate chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations were 22\% and 3-7 g L-1, respectively. It is shown that Scenedesmus sp. could simultaneously assimilate biogas CO2 and organic carbon in the digestate. A digestate concentration of 5 g COD L-1 resulted in peak algal biomass concentration, COD removal and bio-CO2 fixation efficiency with values of 1.79 g L-1, 69.1\% and 98.2\%, respectively in 10 day algae cultivation. Based on the experimental results, a diagram was proposed to show a wastewater treatment to give an algae and methane bioenergy production concept as an example of circular economy.

TI  - The role of tidal salt marsh as an energy source for marine transient and resident finfishes: A stable isotope approach
AB  - Stable isotope ratios of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur (delta(13)C, delta(15)N, and delta(34)S) in bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli and white perch Morons americana from Delaware Bay were a function of capture location and, for restored tidal salt marshes, possibly a function of the relative position of the marsh restoration trajectory. White perch collected in polyhaline restoration and reference (Moore's Beach) sites had stable isotope signatures that reflected contributions from both benthic microalgae and Spartina alterniflora. Isotope values from white perch captured at the reference site were slightly enriched compared with those captured at the restoration sites. At upper estuary oligo-mesohaline locations, Phragmites australis contributed to the isotopic composition of both species. Although P. australis was not dominant at the reference marsh (Mad Horse Creek), it also seemed to influence the dow of nutrients into these species. White perch were not collected in open waters of Delaware Bay, but bay anchovy were abundant at offshore sampling stations. A striking result of this study was that stable isotopes that originated in macrophytes and benthic microalgae of salt marshes occurred ubiquitously among bay anchovy collected several kilometers from shore. Interestingly, fish from Mad Horse Creek, a reference marsh where Phragmites was abundant only along creek banks, were intermediate in their isotopic composition. Although benthic microalgal signatures varied both within and among sites, the isotopic composition of bay anchovy and white perch was clearly influenced by these primary producers across all marsh types. Particulate organic matter (POM) appeared to play a lesser role in bay anchovy and white perch nutrition, although depletion of POM sulfur due to the presence of inorganic sulfur may have led to underestimates of the contribution of phytoplankton. Further studies are required to elucidate the relative role of phytoplankton in the trophodynamics of these species.

TI  - Reduced calcification of marine plankton in response to increased atmospheric CO2
AB  - The formation of calcareous skeletons by marine planktonic organisms and their subsequent sinking to depth generates a continuous rain of calcium carbonate to the deep ocean and underlying sediments1. This is important in regulating marine carbon cycling and ocean-atmosphere CO2 exchange2. The present rise in atmospheric CO2 levels3 causes significant changes in surface ocean pH and carbonate chemistry4. Such changes have been shown to slow down calcification in corals and coralline macroalgae5,6, but the majority of marine calcification occurs in planktonic organisms. Here we report reduced calcite production at increased CO2 concentrations in monospecific cultures of two dominant marine calcifying phytoplankton species, the coccolithophorids Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa oceanica. This was accompanied by an increased proportion of malformed coccoliths and incomplete coccospheres. Diminished calcification led to a reduction in the ratio of calcite precipitation to organic matter production. Similar results were obtained in incubations of natural plankton assemblages from the north Pacific ocean when exposed to experimentally elevated CO2 levels. We suggest that the progressive increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations may therefore slow down the production of calcium carbonate in the surface ocean. As the process of calcification releases CO2 to the atmosphere, the response observed here could potentially act as a negative feedback on atmospheric CO2 levels.

TI  - A critical review of the life cycle climate impact in seaweed value chains to support carbon accounting and blue carbon financing
AB  - Seaweed is often touted as a blue economy resource with climate benefits. Several calls are made to scale the industry up and to use blue carbon financing to create additional incentives for the sector to expand. But how much of a climate crisis panacea is seaweed, and under which conditions can climate benefits be realized? The article reviews the literature on climate impacts from seaweed value chains and proposes a cradle-to-grave structure for carbon accounting in seaweed value chains. While the literature points towards several ways in which climate benefits can be generated, the evidence base for net negative emissions across the value chain is not robust enough to suggest seaweed value chains, by default, are a climate solution. Instead, climate effects depend on the specific production setup, product choice and the fate of the product on the market. Climate benefits can only be claimed by tracking blue carbon flows across whole life cycles and over time. Knowledge gaps relate to effects at sea, the role of temporarily locking carbon into products and the effects of introducing this resource to the market. Blue carbon financing should be directed only to setups proven to lead to additional and permanent carbon storage. Â© 2022 The Authors

TI  - Economic and biophysical limits to seaweed farming for climate change mitigation
AB  - Net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets are driving interest in opportunities for biomass-based negative emissions and bioenergy, including from marine sources such as seaweed. Yet the biophysical and economic limits to farming seaweed at scales relevant to the global carbon budget have not been assessed in detail. We use coupled seaweed growth and technoeconomic models to estimate the costs of global seaweed production and related climate benefits, systematically testing the relative importance of model parameters. Under our most optimistic assumptions, sinking farmed seaweed to the deep sea to sequester a gigaton of CO2 per year costs as little as US$480 per tCO2 on average, while using farmed seaweed for products that avoid a gigaton of CO2-equivalent GHG emissions annually could return a profit of $50 per tCO2-eq. However, these costs depend on low farming costs, high seaweed yields, and assumptions that almost all carbon in seaweed is removed from the atmosphere (that is, competition between phytoplankton and seaweed is negligible) and that seaweed products can displace products with substantial embodied non-CO2 GHG emissions. Moreover, the gigaton-scale climate benefits we model would require farming very large areas (&gt;90,000 km2)â€”a &gt;30-fold increase in the area currently farmed. Our results therefore suggest that seaweed-based climate benefits may be feasible, but targeted research and demonstrations are needed to further reduce economic and biophysical uncertainties.

TI  - Wastewater, reclaimed water, and seawater utilization in the production of microalgae-based fuels
AB  - Biofuel production from microalgae is affected by the cost of the cultivation of microalgal biomass. The cultivation of microalgae for third-generation biofuels in wastewater, reclaimed water, and seawater could be a cost-effective way to obtain microalgal biomass. This option would serve to reduce costs and treat wastewaters and reclaimed water at the same time. Autotrophic and mixotrophic cultivation make use of wastewater and nutrients, using light and CO2 to obtain high percentages of nitrogen and phosphorous removal. The advantage of microalgae grown in this way is twofold: wastewater treatment and microalgal production without the addition of water and nutrients. Biofuels from microalgae grown in this way would replace fossil fuels with renewable and carbon-neutral fuels in a sustainable way and contribute to the circular economy of water resources. In this review, an updated evaluation of microalgal cultivation in wastewater, reclaimed water, and seawater together with biofuel generation will be shown. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Published values on the sinking speeds of organic particles from kelp were used, spanning several orders of magnitude. Recent work on quantifying the release of particulate organic matter from farmed kelp was used to link the release of carbon to possible cultivation volumes and scenarios, and finally to link this to the potential for carbon loading on the ocean floor. The results are presented in terms of loading and distribution per unit harvested kelp, and the loading estimates are compared with estimates of natural (background) primary production. According to the simulation results, organic matter may be transported anything from a few (hundred) meters up to a hundred km away from the release site, depending on the sinking rates, time of release, and the location. The depth at which the matter settles on the sea floor likewise depends on the properties of the matter and the sites. The time until settlement varied from minutes to several hundred hours. The results underscore the importance of constraining the dispersal and deposition of detritus from kelp cultivation in order to better understand and quantify associated environmental risks posed by organic loading, and the potential for seafloor carbon sequestration by kelp farming as a nature based climate solution.

TI  - Differential impacts of alternate primary producers on carbon cycling
AB  - Disturbance impacts the spatial distribution of primary producers, which can have cascading effects on ecosystem function. The lower-intertidal zone on the rocky shores of the Pacific Northwest is one such place where wave energy creates a mosaic-like distribution between two assemblages: surfgrass (Phyllospadix scouleri) meadows and macroalgal forests dominated by kelp. We simulated wave disturbance by experimentally removing patches of surfgrass monocultures, resulting in a macroalgal assemblage with increased diversity, biomass, and net primary productivity in the following year. Although surfgrass had a higher C:N compared to macroalgal assemblages, macroalgal assemblages achieved a higher biomass, fixed carbon at a faster rate, and released more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) during photosynthesis. Thus, despite similar standing amounts of carbon, macroalgal assemblages have increased carbon turnover-from fixation to DOC release. Comparative photophysiology indicated that surfgrasses have a competitive advantage over other macrophytes at low light levels, allowing them to persist when disturbance is reduced. Unexpectedly, disturbance in this system increased the potential for carbon sequestration when surfgrass monocultures were replaced by diverse macroalgae.

TI  - Does seaweed offer a solution for bioenergy with biological carbon capture and storage?
AB  - The concept of combining bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) has been identified as one mechanism to achieve energy production with a net negative atmospheric carbon emission. Conventional geological carbon capture and storage involves large capital outlay and recurring expense. Therefore there is increased interest in coupling biological carbon capture and sequestration with biomass production. Systems such as low-input high-diversity native grasslands and biochar production have been heralded as carbon negative biofuels. Another potential production system for bioenergy with biological carbon capture and storage (BEBCCS) is the large-scale cultivation of seaweed (macroalgae) for biofuels. Marine biofuels offer considerable advantages over terrestrial first-generation biofuels in terms of their low land use, fresh water and fertilizer requirements. In addition, they also offer considerable potential in the field of BEBCCS. Macroalgae rapidly accumulate biomass and as part of this process, a significant proportion (estimates range up to 60\%) of the carbon they fix photosynthetically is released into the water. A proportion of this released dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is highly labile and enters the bacterial loop and is rapidly remineralized back to CO2. However, a proportion is known to be resistant to biological degradation and enters the refractory DOC pool. The marine DOC pool is the largest organic carbon pool on the planet and the refractory component is known to have a turnover period of 100s-1000s years. The release of refractory DOC from macroalgae combined with biofuel production offers the potential for large scale carbon negative fuel production.

TI  - Integrated bioremediation techniques in a shrimp farming environment under controlled conditions
AB  - This study investigated the integrated bioremediation techniques for a shrimp culture system to reduce unconsumed feed and the contents of suspended solids (SS), nutrients and organic pollutants using barracuda, clamworm, scallop, large algae and a biofilter. A multi-pool internal circulation system was designed to test the effectiveness of the techniques in the laboratory. The experimental result has shown that Argopecten irradians, Gracilaria lemaneiformis and the biofilter efficiently reduced the contents of SS, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the breeding wastewater. The amount of unconsumed feed was significantly reduced by barracuda and clamworm, but there was an increase in the contents of SS, DIC and DOC in the water due to disturbance by the barracuda and clamworm. The capacity of macroalgae to extract inorganic nitrogen was insufficient. However, the balance of the nitrogen fixation rate of macroalgae and the biological exhaust nitrogen rate within the system should be fully considered. The use of the biofilter alone was not optimal for the remediation of organic matter in shrimp effluent so that auxiliary foam separation technology is needed to improve the ability of the system to remove macromolecules. This study provides a basis for the further development of remediation techniques to reduce the environmental impact of shrimp aquaculture.

TI  - Dissolved organic carbon from cultured kelp Saccharina japonica: production, bioavailability, and bacterial degradation rates
AB  - Seaweed farming is widely perceived as one of the most environmentally benign types of aquaculture activity. In the past 10 yr, global seaweed production has doubled and reached 31.8 million t. Farmed seaweed also has important functions in local ecosystems. We focus on the production, bioavailability, and bacterial degradation rates of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from cultured kelp Saccharina japonica. Semi in situ incubations in 2 growing seasons were conducted to estimate DOC production, and laboratory incubations were used to determine bioavailability and decay rates of DOC from cultured kelp. Results showed that DOC production was 6.2-7.0 mg C (g dry wt)(-1) d(-1) in the growing seasons, and the proportion of DOC in net primary production was 23.7-39.1\%. The decomposition rate of DOC was 4 +/- 1\% d(-1) and 9 +/- 1\% d(-1) in January and April, respectively. About 37.8\% remained as refractory DOC after 150 d incubation. It was calculated that the total DOC from kelp in Sanggou Bay was approximately 11.3 times of that from phytoplankton for the whole bay (144 km(2)). Our results suggest that more than half of the bioavailable DOC will be exported out of the bay to potentially support the wider food chain through bacterial uptake. Cultured kelp is therefore an important source of DOC in the embayment, contributes to the coastal DOC pool and provides a potential pathway for carbon dioxide sequestration.

TI  - Microbial-mediated contribution of kelp detritus to different forms of oceanic carbon sequestration
AB  - Kelp is one of the most important primary producers in the coastal oceans. When it matures or begins to decay, a substantial amount of detritus sinks and is degraded by microorganisms. However, the fate of these detritus after long-term microbial degradation, which is closely related to their ultimate carbon sequestration function, is not yet clear. Here, by studying the long-term (210-day) microbial degradation dynamics of kelp detritus, we reveal that the bioavailable components of kelp detritus (when kept in the dark) persisted for over four months. This left a considerable amount (in total, ca. 8.85\%) of different forms of stable carbon that could function in long-term carbon sequestration. Among them, recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon (RDOC), recalcitrant particulate organic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon, particulate inorganic carbon, and residual large particulate carbon accounted for 1.27\%, 0.12\%, 6.00\%, 0.04\%, and 1.41\% of the initial kelp detrital carbon, respectively. The remaining organic carbon resisted further degradation due to the high content of humic-like substances, polycyclic aromatics, and highly aromatic compounds. Microbial community structure showed obvious successional characteristics during the long-term degradation process, driving the gradual transformation of the detritusderived organic carbon from labile to recalcitrant. Notably, microbial transformation of the bioavailable components of kelp detritus contributed 28.7\% of the remaining RDOC molecular species. This study provides novel insights into the contribution of the microbial-mediated degradation of kelp detritus to different forms of carbon sequestration.

TI  - Recycling of Steelmaking Slag in Seawater as an Iron Supplier: Effects of Slag Composition, Carbonation and Usage of Gluconic Acid
AB  - Disappearing of benthic seaweeds in coastal areas has gradually become a serious environmental problem worldwide. One possible reason is iron deficiency in seawater. As a major byproduct generated in steelmaking industry, steelmaking slag is rich in Fe and has the potential to restore seaweeds by supplying soluble Fe in seawater. The authors aim to develop a sustainable approach for ecosystem restoration in coastal areas by utilizing steelmaking slag. This work investigates the releasing behavior of elements from synthesized steelmaking slags in seawater and clarifies the effects of slag composition, carbonation and usage of gluconic acid. Slag with larger CaO/SiO2 ratio (= 3.0) has difficulty in releasing Fe into seawater directly, due to drastic increase of pH. Combination of slag carbonation and gluconic acid usage is necessary and effective in boosting release of Fe. Slag with smaller CaO/SiO2 ratio (= 1.0) would not cause drastic increase of pH in seawater and thus releasing of Fe is easier. These results have proved the potential value and feasibility of using steelmaking slag as an underwater iron fertilizer.

TI  - Testing for terrestrial and freshwater microalgae productivity under elevated CO2 conditions and nutrient limitation
AB  - Background: Microalgae CO2 fixation results in the production of biomass rich in high-valuable products, such as fatty acids and carotenoids. Enhanced productivity of valuable compounds can be achieved through the microalgaeâ€™s ability to capture CO2 efficiently from sources of high CO2 contents, but it depends on the species. Culture collections of microalgae offer a wide variety of defined strains. However, an inadequate understanding of which groups of microalgae and from which habitats they originate offer high productivity under increased CO2 concentrations hampers exploiting microalgae as a sustainable source in the bioeconomy. Results: A large variety of 81 defined algal strains, including new green algal isolates from various terrestrial environments, were studied for their growth under atmospheres with CO2 levels of 5â€“25% in air. They were from a pool of 200 strains that had been pre-selected for phylogenetic diversity and high productivity under ambient CO2. Green algae from terrestrial environments exhibited enhanced growth up to 25% CO2. In contrast, in unicellular red algae and stramenopile algae, which originated through the endosymbiotic uptake of a red algal cell, growth at CO2 concentrations above 5% was suppressed. While terrestrial stramenopile algae generally tolerated such CO2 concentrations, their counterparts from marine phytoplankton did not. The tests of four new strains in liquid culture revealed enhanced biomass and chlorophyll production under elevated CO2 levels. The 15% CO2 aeration increased their total carotenoid and fatty acid contents, which were further stimulated when combined with the starvation of macronutrients, i.e., less with phosphate and more with nitrogen-depleted culture media. Conclusion: Green algae originating from terrestrial environments, Chlorophyceae and Trebouxiophyceae, exhibit enhanced productivity of carotenoids and fatty acids under elevated CO2 concentrations. This ability supports the economic and sustainable production of valuable compounds from these microalgae using inexpensive sources of high CO2 concentrations, such as industrial exhaust fumes.

TI  - Enhanced biomass and CO2 sequestration of Chlorella vulgaris using a new mixotrophic cultivation method
AB  - CO2 sequestration using microalgae has been deemed as a promising way, which can fix CO2 and simultaneously produce valuable bio-products. However, large scale open-pond production of Chlorella vulgaris is normally cultured using acetic acid as a carbon source, which is costly and shows a low efficiency in CO2 fixation. Here, a new mixotrophic culture strategy using both CO2 and acetic acid was developed and evaluated for CO2 sequestration by a C. vulgaris culture in an open pond. Our results show that the growth rate of C. vulgaris under this new mixotrophic condition reaches 0.24 g/L/d, which is higher than the 0.15 and 0.21 g/L/d of photoheterotrophic culture with acetic acids and photoautotrophic culture with CO2, respectively. The averaged CO2 fixation rate was determined as 0.29 g/L/d, which is much higher than heterotrophic method but slightly lower than photoautotrophic method. This result was further confirmed in a 125 m(2) open raceway pond. Physiological and biochemical characterization showed that the cell quality of C. vulgaris under mixotrophic conditions is better than those of photoautotrophic method and photoheterotrophic cultures. The enzyme activity assay and transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed that the metabolism of carbohydrates and amino acids was significantly enhanced under mixotrophic condition compared with other groups, which may attribute to the increased biomass and CO2 sequestration of C. vulgaris. Our results suggest that this mixotrophic strategy can be applied in large-scale cultivation of C. vulgaris for biomass production and CO2 sequestration.

TI  - Testing the climate intervention potential of ocean afforestation using the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt
AB  - Ensuring that global warming remains &lt;2 Â°C requires rapid CO2 emissions reduction. Additionally, 100â€“900 gigatons CO2 must be removed from the atmosphere by 2100 using a portfolio of CO2 removal (CDR) methods. Ocean afforestation, CDR through basin-scale seaweed farming in the open ocean, is seen as a key component of the marine portfolio. Here, we analyse the CDR potential of recent re-occurring trans-basin belts of the floating seaweed Sargassum in the (sub)tropical North Atlantic as a natural analogue for ocean afforestation. We show that two biogeochemical feedbacks, nutrient reallocation and calcification by encrusting marine life, reduce the CDR efficacy of Sargassum by 20â€“100%. Atmospheric CO2 influx into the surface seawater, after CO2-fixation by Sargassum, takes 2.5â€“18 times longer than the CO2-deficient seawater remains in contact with the atmosphere, potentially hindering CDR verification. Furthermore, we estimate that increased ocean albedo, due to floating Sargassum, could influence climate radiative forcing more than Sargassum-CDR. Our analysis shows that multifaceted Earth-system feedbacks determine the efficacy of ocean afforestation. Â© 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Loofah-based microalgae and cyanobacteria biocomposites for intensifying carbon dioxide capture
AB  - Microalgae and cyanobacteria have been evaluated for biological CO2 capture from flue gases for over 40 years; however, commercial open ponds and photobioreactors suffer many drawbacks including a slow rate of CO2 capture and high water usage. We evaluate an intensified 3D cell immobilisation approach with a small water demand, by coating latex binders onto defined surface area (947 m(2) m(-3)) and void space (81.78 +/- 4.41 \%) loofah sponge scaffolds, forming porous 3D biocomposites with three microalgae species; freshwater Chlorella vulgaris, marine Dunaliella salina and Nannochloropsis oculata, and two strains of freshwater Synechococcus elongatus cyanobacteria. Binder toxicity and adhesion screening protocols were established ahead of eight weeks semi-batch and six weeks continuous CO2 fixation trials. Acrylic and polyurethane binders were effective for microalgae, and bio-based (Replebin (R)) binders were suited for cyanobacteria. The highest average net CO2 fixation rates from each species were 0.17 +/- 0.01, 0.25 +/- 0.01, 0.12 +/- 0.01, 0.68 +/- 0.18 and 0.93 +/- 0.30 g CO2 g(biomass)(-1) d(-1) for C. vulgaris, D. salina, N. oculata, S. elongatus PCC 7942 and S. elongatus CCAP 1479/1A respectively. This equates to predicted CO2 capture from scaled systems of up to 340.11 +/- 110 tCO(2) t(biomass)(-1) yr(-1). Analysis of the kinetics of CO2 absorbtion and SEM imaging suggests that the cells were embedded within a polymer film that covered the scaffold. Biocomposites continuously fed with 5\% CO2 had high lipid contents approaching 70 \% dry weight. This biocomposite approach shows promise to intensify biological CO2 capture and possible application in bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).

TI  - Increased CO2 modifies the carbon balance and the photosynthetic yield of two common Arctic brown seaweeds: Desmarestia aculeata and Alaria esculenta
AB  - Ocean acidification affects with special intensity Arctic ecosystems, being marine photosynthetic organisms a primary target, although the consequences of this process in the carbon fluxes of Arctic algae are still unknown. The alteration of the cellular carbon balance due to physiological acclimation to an increased CO2 concentration (1300 ppm) in the common Arctic brown seaweeds Desmarestia aculeata and Alaria esculenta from Kongsfjorden (Svalbard) was analysed. Growth rate of D. aculeata was negatively affected by CO2 enrichment, while A. esculenta was positively affected, as a result of a different reorganization of the cellular carbon budget in both species. Desmarestia aculeata showed increased respiration, enhanced accumulation of storage biomolecules and elevated release of dissolved organic carbon, whereas A. esculenta showed decreased respiration and lower accumulation of storage biomolecules. Gross photosynthesis (measured both as O-2 evolution and C-14 fixation) was not affected in any of them, suggesting that photosynthesis was already saturated at normal CO2 conditions and did not participate in the acclimation response. However, electron transport rate changed in both species in opposite directions, indicating different energy requirements between treatments and species specificity. High CO2 levels also affected the N-metabolism, and C-13 isotopic discrimination values from algal tissue pointed to a deactivation of carbon concentrating mechanisms. Since increased CO2 has the potential to modify physiological mechanisms in different ways in the species studied, it is expected that this may lead to changes in the Arctic seaweed community, which may propagate to the rest of the food web.

TI  - Optimizing the initial cultivation stages of kelp Ecklonia radiata for restoration
AB  - Restoration of kelp forests typically relies on transplanting sporophylls to new locations and has limited application in regions with low remnant kelp cover. Cultivated kelp requires fewer sporophylls and is a potential alternative and sustainable source of transplants for large-scale restoration projects. Naturally sourced fertile sporophylls, however, are still required as ``seed{''} stock in cultivation practices, thus optimizing cultivation methods is important to minimize this dependency on wild stocks. To assist in optimizing the early-stage cultivation methods for restoring beds of the laminarian kelp Ecklonia radiata, we first tested the effects of sporophyll transport, storage, and dehydration on zoospore release. We then tested for effects of inoculum storage temperature on zoospore abundance, and lastly for media sterilization and inoculum concentration effects on both zoospore settlement and resulting gametophyte densities. Our results show, to maximize zoospore release, sporophylls should be transported dry and inoculated within 3 hours. Inoculum can be stored at 4 degrees C without affecting zoospore abundance and should be added to sterilized media at lower concentrations to reduce settled zoospore density and improve post-settlement survival of the gametophyte stage. This study provides practical recommendations for optimizing the initial cultivation procedures of E. radiata. To develop a full life-cycle cultivation protocol for kelp restoration purposes, future research should focus on optimizing sporophyte production, out-planting and transplanting techniques.

TI  - Climate Regulation as a Service from Estuarine and Coastal Ecosystems
AB  - Coastal regions, at the interface between terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems, play an important role in global biogeochemical cycles. This chapter reviews the climate regulation services of estuarine and coastal ecosystems (ECEs) including tidal salt marshes, mangroves, seagrass beds, macroalgal forests, coral reefs, and coastal shelf ecosystems. ECEs regulate global and regional climates by sequestering or releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHGs). ECEs are extremely productive biologically, with net primary production rates per unit area among the highest of any ecosystem. Consequently, ECEs play a globally significant role as carbon sinks, with carbon storage rates per unit area of many habitats far exceeding that of land habitats at the rate of about 10 times that of temperate terrestrial forests and 50 times that of tropical forests. Furthermore, sedimentation does not reach an equilibriumcarbon balance as occurs in terrestrial systems, whose sequestration capacity is forecasted to decrease this century. Conversely, they are large potential sources of GHG's if disturbed or mismanstored over long time frames (thousands of years) as a consequence of the large belowground biomass and the absence of fire and nitrous oxide are negligible. A review of literature provided sequestration rates for various coastal habitats. Using these in combination with global extent of selected habitats, this chapter finds that GHGs worldwide, mangroves, seagrass beds, and salt marshes combine to sequester a minimum of 136 000 tonnes C annually into long-term carbon storage. Assuming prices of CO2e from $10 to $90 per tonne, the value of the annual sequestration is $5 -45 billion. This is an underestimate due to data gaps and, the limited assessment of the area of these three coastal ecosystem habitats, and relates only to long-term occurs in kelp forests, estuaries, and coastal shelf seas. Many ECEs are under threat globally from sea-level rise, coastal development, pollution, and other anthropogenic stressors, and protection and restoration of ECEs may be an important tool for mitigating climate change. Currently, these habitats are not included in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) carbon accounting frameworks, and therefore are excluded from incentive schemes such as carbon markets and other incentive programs, but their inclusion deserves consideration due to their potential for mitigating global climate change. The global distribution of C sequestration in ECEs reveals that large areas of the tropics are home to the highest sequestration rates and occur in developing countries, which also have the highest rates of coastal habitat degradation. Schemes such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) may bring revenues and aged. Critically, carbon sequestration in many coastal habitats is superior to that of terrestrial habitats, as carbon is generally threat. Furthermore, carbon is generally broken down anaerobically; hence, emissions of other potent GHGs such as methane storage. The figures do not include short-term carbon storage in biomass, and further unaccounted for carbon sequestration added benefits to developing countries for instigating projects and marine protected areas for conservation. Many small island nations and developing countries in the tropics are particularly vulnerable to climate change and contain large swathes of seagrasses and mangroves compared to overall land area, but do not contain large areas of forests or grasslands, which would apply to REDDin its current form. Coastal habitats thus not only present an untapped potential for inclusion in climate change mitigation schemes, but also present a little-recognized risk of loss of large carbon stocks if their degradation and destruction are not reduced or halted.

TI  - Production of dissolved carbon and alkalinity during macroalgal wrack degradation on beaches: a mesocosm experiment with implications for blue carbon
AB  - Marine macroalgae are a key primary producer in coastal ecosystems, but are often overlooked in blue carbon inventories. Large quantities of macroalgal detritus deposit on beaches, but the fate of wrack carbon (C) is little understood. If most of the wrack carbon is respired back to CO2, there would be no net carbon sequestration. However, if most of the wrack carbon is converted to bicarbonate (alkalinity) or refractory DOC, wrack deposition would represent net carbon sequestration if at least part of the metabolic products (e.g., reduced Fe and S) are permanently removed (i.e., long-term burial) and the DOC is not remineralised. To investigate the release of macroalgal C via porewater and its potential to contribute to C sequestration (blue carbon), we monitored the degradation of Ecklonia radiata in flow-through mesocosms simulating tidal flushing on sandy beaches. Over 60Â days, 81% of added E. radiata organic matter (OM) decomposed. Per 1Â mol of detritus C, the degradation produced 0.48 Â± 0.34Â mol C of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (59%) and 0.25 Â± 0.07Â mol C of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) (31%) in porewater, and a small amount of CO2 (0.3 Â± 0.0Â mol C; ca. 3%) which was emitted to the atmosphere. A significant amount of carbonate alkalinity was found in porewater, equating to 33% (0.27 Â± 0.05Â mol C) of the total degraded C. The degradation occurred in two phases. In the first phase (days 0â€“3), 27% of the OM degraded, releasing highly reactive DOC. In the second phase (days 4â€“60), the labile DOC was converted to DIC. The mechanisms underlying E. radiata degradation were sulphate reduction and ammonification. It is likely that the carbonate alkalinity was primarily produced through sulphate reduction. The formation of carbonate alkalinity and semi-labile or refractory DOC from beach wrack has the potential to play an overlooked role in coastal carbon cycling and contribute to marine carbon sequestration.

TI  - Carbon storage estimation of Lessonia trabeculata kelp beds in Southern Peru: an analysis from the San Juan de Marcona region
AB  - Carbon storage is one of the most important ecosystem services provided by kelp beds. Laminarialean kelps are widely harvested along the Warm Temperate South-eastern Pacific coast, a marine province shared by Chile and Peru. Carbon storage assessments of kelps in Peru are lacking. From a blue economy and sustainable management perspectives, information on the carbon storage of kelps is important. We conduct the first carbon storage assessment of Lessonia trabeculata in Peru and contribute to the development of biomass estimation models in order to monitor kelps using the least destructive methodologies. We chose three commonly harvested sites in San Juan de Marcona to haphazardly extract Lessonia trabeculata sporophytes using transects. Sporophyte height (m), wet biomass (kg), maximum (D) and minimum (d) holdfast disk widths (cm) were measured in the field. In the laboratory, C content was measured to calculate the best-fitting coefficients for future estimations by using allometric equations. Individual biomass was best estimated from sporophyte height through a rational model, while holdfast area (ellipse in cm2) was a good proxy of biomass with a sinusoidal model. The southernmost, least accessible, and most exposed site (Elefante) had significantly higher values of stored carbon. We estimated a carbon standing stock (from sporophytes only) of 2044 t C in these kelp beds. Nevertheless, additional and more detailed measurements will likely produce more accurate estimates both in time and space. We provide allometric equations for future carbon assessments. Our results highlight the importance carbon assessment for kelp management and blue carbon estimates and the need to develop science-based marine planning strategies.

TI  - A study of the energetics and economics of microalgal mass culture with the marine chlorophyte Tetraselmis suecica: Implications for use of power plant stack gases
AB  - The marine phytoplankter Tetraselmis suecica was grown in shallow outdoor flumes for a period of approximately 6 months at the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii. In full sunlight, gross production rates were 15â€“20 g C mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1. The corresponding photosynthetic efficiencies (PE's) were 9â€“10%. Respiration losses removed about half the gross production. The CO2 utilization efficiencies of 96 Â± 11% were achieved by bubbling CO2 into the culture with the use of a counterflow sump system. Adding the CO2 in the form of carbonated water resulted in utilization efficiencies of 81 Â± 11%. Archimedes screws proved superior to both paddle wheels and propellers as a means of circulating the water in the flumes. Insertion of foil arrays into the flumes to effect systematic mixing of the culture significantly enhanced production. The enhancement was greater when the foils were oriented at a small angle relative to the horizontal than when they were oriented at the same angle relative to the vertical. Light modulation effects are implicated as the probable cause of most of the enhancement. Substitution of electric power plant stack gases for pure CO2 resulted in no significant change in the production of T. suecica grown in chemostat culture.

TI  - Removal of CO2 from flue gas using seaweed porous carbons prepared by urea doping and KOH activation
AB  - Capture of CO2 and utilization of marine biomass resources have attracted more and more attention due to climate change and lack of terrestrial resources. In this article, using sargassum and enteromorpha as raw materials, two kinds of seaweed porous carbons adsorbents were prepared using urea doping and KOH activation to capture CO2 from flue gas. Characterization methods such as BET, pH, SEM, FTIR, and XPS were used to investigate the physicochemical properties of seaweed porous carbon adsorbents. The main parameters and flue gas components that may affect the CO2 adsorption, as well as the adsorption mechanism were also studied. The results show that compared with inactivated biochars, all of the specific surface areas, the surface functional groups, and the CO2 adsorption capacities of the seaweed porous carbons adsorbents (e.g., NSK (2) and NEK (2)) are significantly increased. The highest CO2 adsorption capacities of NSK (2) and NEK (2) are up to 4.06 and 3.25 mmol/g at 25 Â°C, respectively. Moreover, NSK (2) and NEK (2) still show excellent CO2 adsorption performance after 10 regeneration experiments (reaching 3.69 and 2.93 mmol/g, respectively). Other flue gas components such as O2 and NO have no effect on the CO2 adsorption performance of NSK (2) and NEK (2), while H2O (g) and SO2 exhibit an inhibitory effect. The pseudo-first-order model can reasonably explain the CO2 adsorption processes of two kinds of seaweed porous carbons adsorbents, showing that external mass transfer is the main control step for the CO2 capture. Thermodynamic analysis results demonstrate that physical adsorption is dominant in the CO2 adsorption process over NSK (2) and NEK (2), and chemical adsorption only plays a supplementary role.

TI  - Comparative life cycle assessment of microalgae cultivation for non-energy purposes using different carbon dioxide sources
AB  - The ability of microalgae to sequester carbon and at the same time synthesise valuable compounds with potential applications in nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries makes them attractive for commercial deployment, especially in view of a blue bioeconomy. Among microalgae, the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum is considered as an important potential source of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as eicosapentanoic acid, an essential polyunsaturated fatty acid with anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. The aim of this study was to perform the Life Cycle Assessment of the cultivation of P. tricornutum - at semi-industrial scale in photobioreactor - for the production of high-quality bioactive compounds comparing synthetic carbon dioxide supply to a supply with waste carbon dioxide from a biogas upgrading process hypothesizing industrial symbiosis network. The effect of renewable energy use instead of the European electricity mix was also examined. Primary data on the production process, including the stages of cleaning and sterilisation, cultivation, harvesting and freeze-drying, were used. The midpoint impact categories recommended in the ILCD Handbook were used for performing the impact assessment. A sensitivity analysis was also performed on algal productivity, culture medium recirculation factor and amount of solvents per cleaning cycle. Firstly, results indicate in general cultivation and freeze-drying as the most contributing stages to the impacts. Secondly, they demonstrate in the comparative assessment that the use of carbon dioxide from the biogas upgrading is a feasible and attractive alternative to the synthetic one, as it allows for the improvement of the environmental performance of the production process in all the analysed impact categories. Finally, sensitivity analysis suggests that the environmental performance could be further improved by acting on other key factors, such as electricity source, nutrients culture medium and cleaning solutions.

TI  - Integration of anaerobic digestion and microalgal cultivation for digestate bioremediation and biogas upgrading
AB  - Biogas is the gaseous byproduct obtained during anaerobic digestion which is rich in methane, along with a significant amount of other gases like CO2. The removal of CO2 is essential to upgrade the biogas to biomethane (> 95\% methane content). High CO2 tolerant microalgae can be employed as a biological CO2 scrubbing agent for biogas upgrading. Many microalgal strains tolerant to the levels of CO2 and CH4 seen in biogas have been reported. A CO2 removal efficiency of 50-99\% can be attained based on the microalgae used and the cultivation conditions applied. Nutrient-rich liquid digestate obtained from anaerobic digestion can also be used as the cultivation medium for microalgae, performing biogas upgrading and digestate bioremediation simultaneously. Mixotrophic cultivation enables microalgae to utilize the organic carbon present in the liquid digestate along with nitrogen and phosphorus. Microalgae appears to be a potential biological CO2 scrubbing agent for efficient biogas upgrading.

TI  - The roles of macroalgae in climate change mitigation: Opportunities and challenges for marine-based carbon donor
AB  - Anthropogenic activities will lead to an exponential increase in CO2 emissions in the future. Increased CO2 emissions have an impact on global climate patterns, ocean acidification, and ecosystem function. Marine vegetation has the potential to absorb CO2 through photosynthesis and store carbon in its biomass and sediments. This is known as blue carbon. Research on blue carbon in the world, including Indonesia, is more focused on seagrass and mangroves because including macroalgae carbon in the blue carbon strategy is still controversial. Currently, there are many considerations for including macroalgal carbon in the blue carbon strategy. Macroalgae have a shorter life cycle than seagrass and mangroves. In addition, macroalgae generally grow on hard substrates, resulting in lower levels of carbon storage than seagrass and mangroves. However, macroalgae can serve as carbon donors and contribute to the effort to mitigate climate change. In this review, we present the potential and challenges of macroalgae as carbon donors. Macroalgae will be significant as carbon donors if they have the following three criteria: high production of biomass; effective biomass moved to recipient habitat; and carbon donors that can be buried in recipient habitat. The fate of macroalgae carbon in recipient habitats still needs to be studied. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - A review of the biology, culture, exploitation and utilization potentials seaweed resources: Case study in Nigeria
AB  - The importance of seaweeds cuts across various environmental, ecologic, socio-economic benefits and services as food for man, in the phycocolloids and expanding phycosupplement industries, as sink for excess carbon dioxide and excess nutrients; for sustainable energy generation and as fossil fuel substitutes. In view of this, seaweeds could become an important economic niche for Asian(Japan and China), Nigeria and other coastal African countries provided adequate research is undertaken in studying their diversity, biochemical compositions and potentials for culture in order to harness the numerous opportunities which can be derived. This article reviews the biological characteristics, potential products and uses, culture and transplantation, distribution and biodiversity, status of exploitation and conservation. Benefits of developing seaweed sector and challenges to the exploitation, culture and utilization of potential seaweed resources, aimed at unveiling the potentials in the utilization of seaweed in Nigeria and other interested countries.

TI  - Seaweeds farming for sustainable development goals and blue economy in Bangladesh
AB  - Seaweeds are primary producers and among the important marine ecosystem engineers capable of modifying their surrounding abiotic and biotic environments. The southern coast of Bangladesh has an excellent prospect for seaweeds farming due to favorable environmental conditions and natural availability of commercially important species. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, the present study determines potential contribution of seaweeds toward achieving several targets of United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the blue economic development in Bangladesh. There are 300 households engaged in seaweeds farming, primarily along the southeast coast, producing 390 tonnes wet weight (= 97.5 tonnes dry weight) of seaweeds per annum with potential applications in food, feed, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals sectors. And the current seaweeds production can be increased yearly at ~50% rate, which is 50 million tonnes (dry weight) from ~5,000 km2 farming area when extrapolated to the year 2050. This may bring a positive change to issues regarding food security, gender equality, economic growth, nutrients removal, carbon sequestration, employment and aquatic environmental health. Overall, the benefits of seaweeds farming could reflect on 26 targets of 8 SDGs and potentially contribute US$0.7 million to the blue economy in Bangladesh. Â© 2021

TI  - Long-term harvesting of reeds affects greenhouse gas emissions and microbial functional genes in alkaline wetlands
AB  - Reed (Phragmites australis) is dominant vegetation in alkaline wetlands that is harvested annually due to its economic value. To reveal the effects of harvesting reeds on the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG), the annual soil physicochemical characteristics and flux of GHGs in a reed wetland without harvesting (NHRW) and with harvesting (HRW) were measured. The results showed that after the harvesting of reeds, the total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) significantly decreased, and soil temperature significantly increased. The annual cumulative N2O emissions decreased from 0.73 Â± 0.20 kg haâˆ’1 to âˆ’0.57 Â± 0.49 kg haâˆ’1 with the harvesting of reeds. The annual cumulative CH4 emissions also decreased from 561.88 Â± 18.61 kg haâˆ’1 to 183.13 Â± 18.77 kg haâˆ’1 with the harvesting of reeds. However, harvesting of reeds had only a limited influence on the annual cumulative CO2 emissions. A Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the CO2 and N2O emissions were more sensitive to temperature than the CH4 emissions. Both structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis and slurry incubation confirmed that higher temperatures offset the reduction of CO2 emissions after reed harvesting. Metagenomics showed that the abundance of functional genes involved in both GHG sink and source decreased with reed harvesting. This study presents a comprehensive view of reed harvesting on GHG emissions in alkaline wetlands, yielding new insight into the microbial response and offering a novel perspective on the potential impacts of wetland management.

TI  - Climate Mitigation through Biological Conservation: Extensive and Valuable Blue Carbon Natural Capital in Tristan da Cunha's Giant Marine Protected Zone
AB  - Simple Summary Solving biodiversity loss and climate change are part of the same problem; intact natural habitats can provide powerful and efficient climate mitigation if protected. Beyond the land (forests), there is little appreciation of just how important ocean nature is to climate mitigation. Carbon captured, stored and the rate at which it is buried (sequestration) by marine organisms is called blue carbon. We measured how much blue carbon occurs around the remote islands and seamounts of the Tristan da Cunha archipelago Marine Protected Zone (MPZ). We estimated that there are 300 tonnes of carbon (tC) captured in seaweed biomass each year, a proportion of which will sink and become a part of the long-term sediment carbon store. In deeper water we found a standing stock of \~{}2.3 million tC in the shallowest 1000 m depths, of which equivalent to 0.8 million t of carbon dioxide has the potential to be sequestered. At current carbon prices, and were it to attract blue carbon credits, 24 pound million worth of blue carbon can potentially be sequestered from the standing stock of this small United Kingdom Overseas Territory. This standing stock is protected and growth could, therefore, generate an additional 3.5 pound million worth of sequestered carbon a year, making it an unrecognized major component of the local economy. The economic return on this example MPZ probably ranks highly amongst climate mitigation schemes. The message is that placing meaningful protection to carbon-rich natural habitats can massively help society fight climate change and biodiversity loss. Nations who provide this protection should be fairly compensated, particularly where it comes at the detriment of other economic uses of marine habitats. Carbon-rich habitats can provide powerful climate mitigation if meaningful protection is put in place. We attempted to quantify this around the Tristan da Cunha archipelago Marine Protected Area. Its shallows (<1000 m depth) are varied and productive. The 5.4 km(2) of kelp stores \~{}60 tonnes of carbon (tC) and may export \~{}240 tC into surrounding depths. In deep-waters we analysed seabed data collected from three research cruises, including seabed mapping, camera imagery, seabed oceanography and benthic samples from mini-Agassiz trawl. Rich biological assemblages on seamounts significantly differed to the islands and carbon storage had complex drivers. We estimate \~{}2.3 million tC are stored in benthic biodiversity of waters <1000 m, which includes >0.22 million tC that can be sequestered (the proportion of the carbon captured that is expected to become buried in sediment or locked away in skeletal tissue for at least 100 years). Much of this carbon is captured by cold-water coral reefs as a mixture of inorganic (largely calcium carbonate) and organic compounds. As part of its 2020 Marine Protection Strategy, these deep-water reef systems are now protected by a full bottom-trawling ban throughout Tristan da Cunha and representative no take areas on its seamounts. This small United Kingdom Overseas Territory's reef systems represent approximately 0.8 Mt CO2 equivalent sequestered carbon; valued at >24 pound Million GBP (at the UN shadow price of carbon). Annual productivity of this protected standing stock generates an estimated 3 pound million worth of sequestered carbon a year, making it an unrecognized and potentially major component of the economy of small island nations like Tristan da Cunha. Conservation of near intact habitats are expected to provide strong climate and biodiversity returns, which are exemplified by this MPA.

TI  - Bicarbonate-based carbon capture and algal production system on ocean with floating inflatable-membrane photobioreactor
AB  - This study aims to develop a low-cost microalgae culture system which uses a simple closed vessel as photobioreactor to save manufacturing cost, waves for mixing to save energy cost, and high concentration of bicarbonate for carbon supply to avoid the high cost of CO2 -bubbling pipeline construction on the ocean as well as to control pH by buffering the effect of bicarbonate/carbonate. To test this idea, the alkalihalophilic cyanobacterium Euhalothece sp. was cultured with 1.0 M NaHCO3 in small-scale floating photobioreactors (PBRs) on 10-cm-high artificial waves at first. The final biomass concentration was up to 0.91 and 1.47 g L-1 for indoor and outdoor cultures, respectively. However, the recorded dissolved oxygen (DO) was occasionally over-saturated (> 500\% of air saturation), indicating mass transfer problem. k(L)a in these PBRs with different culture depth was measured then, and the results showed great variation, from 0.13 to 4.87 h(-1). At the scale of 1.0 m(2). this floating PBR was made with low-cost membrane and inflatable design. It was placed on the ocean surface and mixed with natural waves. Biomass concentration of 1.63 g L-1 and productivity of 8.27 g m(-2) day(-1) were obtained in this culture. With these results, the feasibility of a low-cost microalgae culture system was proven, which could systematically reduce the cost of photobioreactor manufacturing, operating, and maintenance.

TI  - Algal capture of carbon dioxide; biomass generation as a tool for greenhouse gas mitigation with reference to New Zealand energy strategy and policy
AB  - The use of algae to capture carbon dioxide as a method for greenhouse gas mitigation is discussed. A small fraction of the sunlight energy that bathes Earth is captured by photosynthesis and drives most living systems. Life on Earth is carbon-based and the energy is used to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide into biological material (biomass), indeed fossil fuels that we consume today are a legacy of mostly algal photosynthesis. Algae can be thought of as marine and freshwater plants that have higher photosynthetic efficiencies than terrestrial plants and are more efficient capturing carbon (Box 1). They have other favourable characteristics for this purpose. In the context of New Zealand energy strategy and policy I discuss progress in growing algae and seaweeds with emphasis on their application for exhaust flue carbon recycling for possible generation of useful biomass. I also introduce schemes utilising wild oceanic algae for carbon dioxide sequestration and the merits and possible adverse effects of using this approach. This paper is designed as an approachable review of the science and technology for policy makers and a summary of the New Zealand policy environment for those wishing to deploy biological carbon sequestration.

TI  - Linking environmental variables with regional-scale variability in ecological structure and standing stock of carbon within UK kelp forests
AB  - Kelp forests represent some of the most productive and diverse habitats on Earth. Understanding drivers of ecological patterns at large spatial scales is critical for effective management and conservation of marine habitats. We surveyed kelp forests dominated by Laminaria hyperborea (Gunnerus) Foslie 1884 across 9 degrees latitude and >1000 km of coastline and measured a number of physical parameters at multiple scales to link ecological structure and standing stock of carbon with environmental variables. Kelp density, biomass, morphology and age were generally greater in exposed sites within regions, highlighting the importance of wave exposure in structuring L. hyperborea populations. At the regional scale, wave-exposed kelp canopies in the cooler regions (the north and west of Scotland) were greater in biomass, height and age than in warmer regions (southwest Wales and England). The range and maximal values of estimated standing stock of carbon contained within kelp forests was greater than in historical studies, suggesting that this ecosystem property may have been previously undervalued. Kelp canopy density was positively correlated with large-scale wave fetch and fine-scale water motion, whereas kelp canopy biomass and the standing stock of carbon were positively correlated with large-scale wave fetch and light levels and negatively correlated with temperature. As light availability and summer temperature were important drivers of kelp forest biomass, effective management of human activities that may affect coastal water quality is necessary to maintain ecosystem functioning, while increased temperatures related to anthropogenic climate change may impact the structure of kelp forests and the ecosystem services they provide.

TI  - Biomass to porous carbon in one step: directly activated biomass for high performance CO2 storage
AB  - This report explores the direct conversion of biomass to activated carbons in one step. We demonstrate the successful conversion of a range of biomass sources, namely, sawdust, the flowering plant Paeonia lactiflora and seaweed (Sargassum fusiforme), to activated carbons via a direct activation process that negates the need for hydrothermal carbonisation or pyrolysis. This is a departure from established practice that requires biomass sources to be first enriched to carbonaceous matter via hydrothermal carbonisation or pyrolysis prior to activation. The direct activation, with KOH as an activating agent, generated activated carbons at yields that are comparable or higher than those of conventional activation routes. The directly activated carbons, whilst offering the advantages of simplicity, lower cost and a greener more sustainable synthesis route, have properties that are similar or superior to analogous carbons prepared via conventional methods. In particular the textural properties, surface functionality and level of graphitic ordering were found to be similar to those of conventionally generated activated carbons. Depending on the activation conditions, the porosity of the directly activated carbons may be tailored towards pore channels of size 5-7 angstrom, which favour post-combustion CO2 uptake and thus the carbons capture up to 1.3 and 4.6 mmol g(-1) of CO2 at 0.15 and 1 bar, respectively, and 25 degrees C with high selectivity. On the other hand, at higher levels of activation, the directly activated carbons can be tailored towards possessing a greater proportion of larger micropores (10-20 angstrom pores) and small mesopores (20-30 angstrom pores) so as to optimize CO2 uptake at moderate to high pressure, for example up to 22 mmol g(-1) (at 25 degrees C) and 31 mmol g(-1) (at 0 degrees C) at 20 bar.

TI  - A review of existing and potential blue carbon contributions to climate change mitigation in the Anthropocene
AB  - The atmospheric concentration of CO2 is steadily increasing and causing climate change. To achieve the Paris 1.5 or 2 degrees C target, negative emission technologies must be deployed in addition to reducing carbon emissions. The ocean is a large carbon sink but the potential of marine primary producers to contribute to carbon neutrality remains unclear. Here we review the alterations to carbon capture and sequestration of marine primary producers (including traditional `blue carbon' plants, microalgae and macroalgae) in the Anthropocene, and, for the first time, assess and compare the potential of various marine primary producers to carbon neutrality and climate change mitigation via biogeoengineering approaches. The contributions of marine primary producers to carbon sequestration have been decreasing in the Anthropocene due to the decrease in biomass driven by direct anthropogenic activities and climate change. The potential of blue carbon plants (mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrasses) is limited by the available areas for their revegetation. Microalgae appear to have a large potential due to their ubiquity but how to enhance their carbon sequestration efficiency is very complex and uncertain. On the other hand, macroalgae can play an essential role in mitigating climate change through extensive offshore cultivation due to higher carbon sequestration capacity and substantial available areas. This approach seems both technically and economically feasible due to the development of offshore aquaculture and a well-established market for macroalgal products. Synthesis and applications. This paper provides new insights and suggests promising directions for utilizing marine primary producers to achieve the Paris temperature target. We propose that macroalgae cultivation can play an essential role in attaining carbon neutrality and climate change mitigation, although its ecological impacts need to be assessed further.

TI  - UTILIZATION OF CARBON-DIOXIDE FROM FOSSIL-FUEL - BURNING POWER-PLANTS WITH BIOLOGICAL-SYSTEMS
AB  - Physical-chemical processes for the capture and sequestration of CO2 from fossil fuel-fired power plant flue-gases are very expensive. Biological processes for CO2 utilization involve plant photosynthesis and conversion of the biomass to fuels, with no net CO2 production. Terrestrial plants cannot utilize flue gas CO2 directly. Only submerged aquatic plants, particularly microalgae, can utilize CO2 from power plant flue gases in a practical process. Microalgae have the potential for achieving high productivities and can be converted to gaseous and liquid fuels. A-preliminary cost-analysis of such a process is presented that suggests that, if high productivities are achievable, overall costs would compare favorably with alternative physical-chemical processes for flue gas CO2 capture and sequestration, but would be higher than CO2 mitigation with terrestrial plants. Microalgae CO2 utilization systems would be most applicable where land and water (seawater, brackish) resources, not readily utilized by agriculture, are available.

AB  - Algae a promising energy reserve due to its adaptability, cheap source, sustainability and it's growth ability in wastewater with efficient sequestration of industrial carbon dioxide. This review summarizes the pathways available for biofuel production from carbon sequestered algae biomass. In this regard, this review focuses on microalgae and its cultivation in wastewater with CO2 sequestration. Conversion of carbon sequestered biomass into bio-fuels via thermo-chemical routes and its engine emission properties. Energy perspective of green gaseous biofuels in near future. This review revealed that algae was the pre-dominant CO2 sequester than terrestrial plants in an eco-friendly and economical way with simultaneous wastewater remediation. Hydrothermal liquefaction of algae biomass was the most preferred mode for biofuel generation than pyrolysis due to high moisture content. The algae based fuels exhibit less greenhouse gases emission and higher energy value. This review helps the researchers, environmentalists and industrialists to evaluate the impact of algae based bio-energy towards green energy and environment. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Potential export of unattached benthic macroalgae to the deep sea through wind-driven Langmuir circulation
AB  - Carbon export to the deep sea is conventionally attributed to the sinking of open ocean phytoplankton. Here, we report a Langmuir supercell event driven by high winds across the shallow Great Bahama Bank that organized benthic non-attached macroalgae, Colpomenia sp., into visible windrows on the seafloor. Ocean color satellite imagery obtained before and after the windrows revealed a 588 km2 patch that rapidly shifted from highly productive macroalgae to bare sand. We assess a number of possible fates for this macroalgae and contend that this event potentially transported negatively buoyant macroalgae to the deep Tongue of the Ocean in a pulsed export of >7 x 1010 g of carbon. This is equivalent to the daily carbon flux of phytoplankton biomass in the pelagic tropical North Atlantic and 0.2-0.8% of daily carbon flux from the global ocean. Coastal banks and bays are highly productive ecosystems that may contribute substantially to carbon export to the deep sea. Â© 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.

TI  - Ulva lactuca: Adsorption, bioaccumulation and remediation
AB  - Pollution of natural waters has become a major issue all over the world. As a result, scientists are studying new and alternative technologies not only to identify the presence of different pollutants in the environments but to remove them from waters and industrial effluents. In these senses, in recent years various red, green and brown seaweeds were investigated as potential bioindicators of contaminants in the environment; as well as their use in remediation process. The green marine macroalga, Ulva lactuca (Chlorophyta) is very common at coastal areas, and is a bloom forming macroalgae that occur in shallow estuaries. This specie has a high bonding affinity with heavy metals and several organic compounds due to the presence of different functional groups on its cell walls (such as carboxyl, hydroxyl, phosphate or amine) that can bind metal and/or organic ions. These characteristics makes it suitable to be used as a bioindicator of marine pollution and for remediation purposes. In general, the investigations are focused on the application of dried algae biomass to promote the removal of different contaminants, mainly metals from aqueous solutions (biosorption); however, the use of living organisms (bioaccumulation), may be advantageous. While growing, living macroalgae can remove simultaneously pollutants and nutrients (nitrates and phosphates) from wastewaters and capture CO2 emissions. In this context, the present chapter will conduct a comprehensive inquiry on the advances related to the possibility of Ulva lactuca to be used as a bioindicator of contamination as well as its capability to be employed for the removal of pollutants from the surrounding environment. It will review these different approaches, and analyse the advantages and disadvantages of each as exposed on the literature, as well as the challenges that these alternatives confront as sustainable remediations technologies.

TI  - Production and Biomass of Seaweeds in Newly Ice-Free Areas: Implications for Coastal Processes in a Changing Antarctic Environment
AB  - The Antarctic rocky coasts are mainly colonized by extensive seaweed communities, which play key roles as food resource, habitat, and refuge for many benthic and pelagic organisms. Due to climate warming, Antarctic marine ecosystems are being affected by glacier retreat opening new habitats, e.g., newly ice-free areas that can be colonized by macroalgae. As a consequence, primary production and fate of macroalgae are changing in these new polar environments. In these ecosystems, the carbon production, especially from large brown algae, is an important food source to the benthic invertebrate communities mainly when other resources are scarce. Thus, in new areas colonized by seaweeds, the trophic structure and biogeochemical fluxes can vary considerably. Moreover, when seaweeds die or are removed by water movement, ice scouring, or storms, they are detached, fragmented, and degraded, incorporating and releasing particulate and dissolved organic matter to the coastal food webs, i.e., they support a large fraction of the secondary production of the benthos. The present chapter is a review of the knowledge on seaweed biomass and production in the coastal Antarctic ecosystem opening a discussion on the role of these organisms as main energy sources in, e.g., small fjords and glacier-influenced sites, impacted by recent climatic change.

TI  - The contributions of allochthonous and autochthonous materials to organic carbon in coastal sediment: A case study from Tangkhen Bay, Phuket, Thailand
AB  - Coastal areas have high potential to store carbon from both terrestrial and marine materials due to the interconnectivity among the habitats. We investigated the contributions of the various sources to the sedimentary organic carbon by examining the Î´13C, Î´15N, %TOC (total organic carbon) and %TN (total nitrogen) of several marine macrophytes, which included three seagrass species: Cymodocea rotundata Ascherson &amp; Schweinfurth, Cymodocea serrulata (R. Brown) Ascherson &amp; Magnus, and Halophila ovalis (R. Brown) J.D. Hooker; three seaweed species: Halimeda macroloba Decaisne, Halimeda borneensis W.R. Taylor, and Halimeda opuntia (Linnaeus) J.V. Lamouroux; and one coral species, Porites sp., over a vertical gradient at Tangkhen Bay, Thailand. The distribution of organisms differed significantly between distances from the shore and seasons (p &lt;.001), with seagrass occupying the area of 150â€“350 m from the shore, while Halimeda was most abundant from 150 to 400 m from the shore. The %TOC and %TN in the sediment were significantly different along the shore (p &lt;.001), with the highest values at 300 m from the shore where the highest organism variability was recoded. Seagrass and Halimeda played major roles in sediment organic matter and carbon contributions, contributing up to 42% of the sedimentary organic carbon, while allochthonous sources such as ocean and terrestrial sources had lower contributions. This study elucidates the importance of macrophytes as organic carbon contributors to sedimentary carbon storage, especially in small semi-enclosed bays. Â© 2019 The Ecological Society of Japan

AB  - OMEGA (Offshore Membrane Enclosures for Growing Algae) is a system for growing microalgae in closed, floating photo-bioreactors constructed of flexible, inexpensive, and durable plastic with small sections of semi-permeable membranes for gas exchange and forward osmosis (FO). OMEGA modules are filled with municipal wastewater and further fertilized by pumping CO2-rich exhaust into OMEGA from wastewater facilities, coastal power plants, or other local sources. OMEGA modules float just below the surface; the surrounding saltwater provides structural support and temperature control, while surface waves mix the algae inside. FO membranes dewater the culture over the 10-day growth cycle to facilitate harvesting. If the system leaks, it releases wastewater that meets current regulation, and freshwater algae that cannot survive in the surrounding saline environment. OMEGA's operation provides a triple payback: production of biofuels, fertilizer, and other valued products, wastewater processing, and carbon sequestration.

TI  - The future of Blue Carbon science
AB  - The term Blue Carbon (BC) was first coined a decade ago to describe the disproportionately large contribution of coastal vegetated ecosystems to global carbon sequestration. The role of BC in climate change mitigation and adaptation has now reached international prominence. To help prioritise future research, we assembled leading experts in the field to agree upon the top-ten pending questions in BC science. Understanding how climate change affects carbon accumulation in mature BC ecosystems and during their restoration was a high priority. Controversial questions included the role of carbonate and macroalgae in BC cycling, and the degree to which greenhouse gases are released following disturbance of BC ecosystems. Scientists seek improved precision of the extent of BC ecosystems; techniques to determine BC provenance; understanding of the factors that influence sequestration in BC ecosystems, with the corresponding value of BC; and the management actions that are effective in enhancing this value. Overall this overview provides a comprehensive road map for the coming decades on future research in BC science.

TI  - In-situ catalytic gasification of kelp-derived biochar as a fuel for direct carbon solid oxide fuel cells
AB  - Direct carbon solid oxide fuel cell (DC-SOFC) is a larruping type of fuel cell due to its all-solid-state structure, which can generate electricity from converting the chemical energy contained in solid carbon fuels directly into electrical energy. As the most abundant carbon storage base on earth, besides commercial carbon, coal or the common biomass carbon fuels, the exploitation of marine biomass as an alternative fuel for DC-SOFC is a very intriguing topic. In order to make efficient utilization of biomass carbon obtained from the ocean, a high performing direct carbon solid oxide fuel cell fuelled by kelp biochar is demonstrated. As comparison, the performances of DC-SOFCs with activated carbon and catalyst-loaded activated carbon fuels are also investigated. Thereinto, the best performance of 285 mW cm(-2) at 850 degrees C is achieved in a DC-SOFC using kelp biochar fuel with Ag-Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-delta/YSZ/Ag-Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-delta  configuration. This study will provide promising utilization of alternative biomass in DC-SOFCs and broaden their available carbon scope. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Growth, protein and carbohydrate contents in Ulva rigida and Gracilaria bursa-pastoris integrated with an offshore fish farm
AB  - Low-technology practices are generally the rule when cultivating marine macroalgae, and they do not necessarily comply with sustainability requirements. When integrated with other marine organisms in land-based setups, seaweed culture can be sustainable also providing environmental benefits. Major challenges of such integrated aquaculture systems, however, are in sea-based setups. The current study examined the growth rates of Ulva rigida and Gracilaria bursa-pastoris, as well as their protein and carbohydrate contents, when exposed to different distances from an offshore, fed-fish cage system. Nutrient levels in seawater were consistently high downstream from the fish cages, significantly enhancing the specific growth rates and cellular contents of starch and soluble protein in these two seaweeds. Specifically, daily maximal growth rates were 17Â %Â dayâˆ’1 for U. rigida and 10Â %Â dayâˆ’1 for G. bursa-pastoris, maximal starch contents were 22 and 21Â %, respectively, and maximal protein contents were on a dry weight basis 7 and 13Â %, respectively. When repositioned at low ambient nutrient levels for 48Â h, the starch and the carbohydrate levels increased by 129 and 131Â % for U. rigida and by 198 and 150Â % for G. bursa-pastoris, respectively. Altogether, this study supports implementing future viable mean of sustainable macroalgae cultivation by taking advantage of excessive nutrients released from an offshore fish farm.

TI  - Carbon and nitrogen concentrations, stocks, and isotopic compositions in red sea seagrass and mangrove sediments
AB  - Coastal vegetated ecosystems are intense global carbon (C) sinks; however, seagrasses and mangroves in the Central Red Sea are depleted in organic C (Corg). Here, we tested whether Corg depletion prevails along the Red Sea, or if sediment Corg and nitrogen (N) stocks reflect the latitudinal productivity gradient of the Red Sea. We assessed Corg and N concentrations, stocks, isotopic compositions (Î´13C and Î´15N), and the potential contribution of primary producers to the organic matter accumulation in seagrass and mangrove sediments along the Eastern coast of the Red Sea. Sediment Corg concentration was higher in mangroves than seagrasses, while N concentrations were similar, resulting in higher C/N ratios in mangrove than seagrass sediments. Mangrove Corg stocks (integrated over the top 10 cm) were twofold higher than those of seagrasses. N concentrations and stocks decreased from south to north in seagrass sediments matching the productivity gradient while Corg concentrations and stocks were uniform. The Î´15N decreased from south to north in seagrass and mangrove sediments, reflecting a shift from nitrate and nitrite as N sources in the south, to N2 fixation toward the north. Stable isotope mixing models showed that seagrass leaves and macroalgae blades were the major contributors to the organic matter accumulation in seagrass sediments; while mangrove leaves were the major contributors in mangrove sediments. Overall, vegetated sediments in the Red Sea tend to be carbonate-rich and depleted in Corg and N, compared to coastal habitats elsewhere. Specifically, mean Corg stocks in Red Sea seagrass and mangrove sediments (7.2 Â± 0.4 and 14.5 Â± 1.4 Mg C ha-1, respectively) are lower than previously reported mean global values. This new information of Blue Carbon resources in the Red Sea provides a background for Blue Carbon programs in the region while also helping to balance global estimates.

TI  - Carbon dioxide sequestration and its enhanced utilization by photoautotroph microalgae
AB  - The ceaseless use of non-renewable fuels leads to the emission of CO2 and other GHG's. Annual Greenhouse Gas Index by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Earth System Research laboratory (ESRL) shows an exponential increase in greenhouse gases led by CO2. Controlling CO2 levels is dire need considering the current trends. The present review highlights different CO2 sequestration (CS) methods including microalgae based CO2 sequestration as the main focal point. It amalgamates the potential microalgae types, their cultivation conditions for lipid and biomass build-up at the expense of sequestered CO2 from air when grown in closed systems. In convention, closed systems are photobioreactors. Photobioreactor design features such as agitation, aeration, and illumination, ought to be ideal for microalgae growth using substrate CO2 economically. Suitable bioreactor design features are highlighted for high cell density microalgae cultivation in photobioreactor. Some successful configurations are also critically reviewed and highlighted for high CO2 sequestration producing enhanced biomass and lipid. Stirred tank photobioreactor, when growing potential microalgae strain, is concluded as best configuration for achieving highest CO2 sequestration rate and hence high cell density biomass with lipid biosynthesis. In addition, coherent and cost-effective CO2 sequestration techniques using microalgae are required in order to increase the effectiveness of the cultivation process in photobioreactor.

TI  - Quantifying baseline costs and cataloging potential optimization strategies for kelp aquaculture carbon dioxide removal
AB  - To keep global surface warming below 1.5 degrees C by 2100, the portfolio of cost-effective CDR technologies must expand. To evaluate the potential of macroalgae CDR, we developed a kelp aquaculture bio-techno-economic model in which large quantities of kelp would be farmed at an offshore site, transported to a deep water ``sink site{'' and then deposited below the sequestration horizon (1,000 m). We estimated the costs and associated emissions of nursery production, permitting, farm construction, ocean cultivation, biomass transport, and Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) for a 1,000 acre (405 ha) ``baseline{''} project located in the Gulf of Maine, USA. The baseline kelp CDR model applies current systems of kelp cultivation to deep water (100 m) exposed sites using best available modeling methods. We calculated the levelized unit costs of CO(2)eq sequestration (LCOC; \$ tCO(2)eq(-1)). Under baseline assumptions, LCOC was \$17,048 tCO(2)eq(-1). Despite annually sequestering 628 tCO(2)eq within kelp biomass at the sink site, the project was only able to net 244 C credits (tCO(2)eq) each year, a true sequestration ``additionality{''} rate (AR) of 39\% (i.e., the ratio of net C credits produced to gross C sequestered within kelp biomass). As a result of optimizing 18 key parameters for which we identified a range within the literature, LCOC fell to \$1,257 tCO(2)eq(-1) and AR increased to 91\%, demonstrating that substantial cost reductions could be achieved through process improvement and decarbonization of production supply chains. Kelp CDR may be limited by high production costs and energy intensive operations, as well as MRV uncertainty. To resolve these challenges, R\&D must (1) de-risk farm designs that maximize lease space, (2) automate the seeding and harvest processes, (3) leverage selective breeding to increase yields, (4) assess the cost-benefit of gametophyte nursery culture as both a platform for selective breeding and driver of operating cost reductions, (5) decarbonize equipment supply chains, energy usage, and ocean cultivation by sourcing electricity from renewables and employing low GHG impact materials with long lifespans, and (6) develop low-cost and accurate MRV techniques for ocean-based CDR.

TI  - Chlorella stigmatophora for Urban Wastewater Nutrient Removal and CO2 Abatement
AB  - Batch experiments were performed to study biomass growth rate, nutrient removal and carbon dioxide bio-fixation of the marine microalgae Chlorella stigmatophora. Four different cultures at different salinities were tested: wastewater (WW), synthetic wastewater (SWW), seawater (SW) and diluted seawater (DSW). Experimental results showed that Chlorella stigmatophora grew satisfactorily in all culture media, except in SWW where inhibition occurred. In all cases, biomass experimental data were fitted to the Verlhust Logistic model (R2 &gt; 0.982, p â‰¤ 0.05). Maximum biomass productivity (Pbmax) and CO2 biofixation (PvCO2) were reached in the WW medium, 1.146 g SSÂ·L-1Â·day-1 and 2.324 g CO2Â·L-1Â·day-1 respectively. The order of maximum specific growth rates (Î¼max) was WW &gt;DSW&gt;SW. In order to compare nitrogen and phosphorous removal kinetics, an estimation of the time required to reach the most restrictive concentration of total N and P in effluents as defined in the Directive 98/1565/CE (10 mg Î£NÂ·L-1 (T10(N)) and 1 mg Î£PÂ·L-1 (T1(P)) was performed. In the WW test T10(N) and T1(P) needed were of 45.15 and 32.27 hours respectively and at the end of the experimental the removal was in both 100%. Â© 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - The fate of marine autotrophic production
AB  - The fate of photosynthetic carbon in marine ecosystems dominated by different types of primary producers was examined by compiling published reports on herbivory, autotrophic respiration, decomposition, carbon storage, and export rates as fractions of net primary production (NPP) in ecosystems dominated by different types of autotrophs (i.e. oceanic and coastal phytoplankton, microphytobenthos, coral reef algae, macroalgae, seagrasses, marsh plants, and mangroves). A large fraction (>40\%) of the NPP of marine ecosystems is decomposed within the system, except for microphytobenthos (decomposition, similar to 25\% of NPP). Herbivory tends to be highest for microalgae (planktonic and benthic, >40\% of NPP) and macroalgae (33.6+/-4.9\% of NPP) and is somewhat less for higher plants. Microphytobenthos export on average a much higher proportion of their NPP than do other microalgal communities, whereas marine macrophytes, except marsh plants, export a substantial proportion (24.3-43.5\% on average) of their NPP. The fraction of NPP stored in sediments is 4-fold greater for higher plants (similar to 10-17\% of NPP) than for algae (0.4-6\% of NPP). On average, similar to 90\% of the phytoplankton NPP is used to support local heterotrophic metabolism (i.e. grazed or decomposed). This fraction is even higher in oceanic communities. Mangrove forests, and to a lesser extent seagrass meadows and macroalgal beds, produce organic carbon well in excess of the ecosystem requirements, with excess photosynthetic carbon (i.e. export rate plus storage) in these ecosystems representing similar to 40\% of NPP. Extrapolation of these results to the global ocean identifies marine angiosperms, which only contribute 4\% of total ocean NPP, as major contributors of the NPP stored (30\% of total ocean carbon storage) and subsequently buried in marine sediments. Consideration of burial of NPP from marine angiosperms should lead to estimates of total burial of marine NPP that exceed current estimates by 15-50\%.

TI  - Advances in metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria for production of biofuels
AB  - Current trends in fossil fuel use, having a direct impact on the global carbon cycle, could potentially be mitigated by adopting the use of biofuels with sustainable features. While bioethanol is currently being used as a major biofuel, especially for transportation worldwide, it is hygroscopic and contains less energy. Therefore, the prospect of biofuels has now shifted to higher alcohols, alkanes, and other molecules that have similar properties to existing gasoline and diesel fuels. Microalgae and cyanobacteria are aquatic photosynthetic microorganisms that can convert CO2 and water into carbon-rich lipids, a substrate for biodiesel production, more efficiently than the agricultural oleaginous crops, making them a superior option to traditional oil-seed crops. Cyanobacteria are gram-negative photosynthetic bacteria that have instrumental roles in global biological carbon sequestration, oxygen evolution, and nitrogen fixation. Furthermore, cyanobacteria have established genetic backgrounds, flexibility in genetic manipulation, and tolerance to the introduction of foreign genes. Metabolic engineering strategies in these photosynthetic hosts have resulted in the conception of cell factories capable of one-step synthesis of biofuel molecules from CO2, light, and water. Two freshwater cyanobacteria species, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Synechocystis 6803) and Synechococcus elongatus sp. PCC 7492 (Synechococcus 7492), and marine Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 (Synechococcus 7002) are among the highly studied cyanobacteria for the production of biofuels. Here, we reviewed the recent progress in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology approaches in cyanobacteria for the synthesis of various biofuel molecules, ranging from alcohols to biodiesels and terpenes or terpenoids.

TI  - A comprehensive insight from microalgae production process to characterization of biofuel for the sustainable energy
AB  - The present article reviews about the algae isolation, microalgae growth, types of cultivation, oil extraction, biodiesel characterization and the advantage of microalgae biomass and its other applications. A detailed review was undertaken on various microalgae harvesting methods, types of oil extraction and biodiesel production. The merits and demerits of open pond systems and photo-bioreactors cultivation are discussed briefly. The various microalgae species and its lipids used for biodiesel production were presented and compared with conventional feedstocks. This article also discusses the key process parameter for in-situ transesterification for biodiesel production such as molar ratio, stirring rate, moisture, reaction time, catalyst type and temperature. The fundamental characterization of the biodiesel and physiochemical properties such as flash point, cetane number, density, kinematic viscosity, pour and cloud point and calorific value were studied and compared with the results of conventional diesel. This study reports that oil from microalgae can be a suitable alternative than edible oils due to ease of growth, separation, and high lipid content. The properties of microalgae biodiesel meet ASTM standards. Overall, algae are not only a potential source for biofuel but can also be used in wastewater treatment, food additives, carbon sequestration, heath care, cancer treatment and aquaculture all of which are discussed in this review.

TI  - Microalgae Cultivation Modes and Systems
AB  - Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms that can be found both in freshwater and marine systems. They can grow as individual cell or associated in chains or small colonies. Recently, microalgae cultivation has garnered huge research attention due to the enormous interest in the bioproduction of valuable and versatile metabolites. This chapter reviews different microalgae cultivation modes and systems, in which four prevalent microalgae cultivation modes, viz. photoautotrophic, heterotrophic, mixotrophic and photoheterotrophic cultivation modes are detailed. Photoautotrophic microalgae cultivation appears to be the most common mode, as the process is driven by the interest in greenhouse gas (CO2) capture and solar energy exploration. Nevertheless, artificial lights are often used to ensure optimum microalgae growth, which goes against the idea of green process. Heterotrophic cultivation is sought to be effective in promoting initial growth of microalgae with the usage of organic carbon sources. Mixotrophic cultivation combines the advantageous features of photoautotrophic and heterotrophic cultivation for higher biomass and lipid productivity, where wastewater would be a promising cultivation medium for this mode. Photoheterotrophic cultivation is the least recommended mode as it inflicts high contamination risk while increasing cultivation cost. In addition, four microalgae cultivation systems are also discussed in this chapter, such as batch, fed-batch, semi-continuous and continuous systems. Batch cultivation system is suitable for small-scale investigation for growth optimization of microalgae while fed batch, semi-continuous and continuous cultivations offer better control over sluggish lag phase and help to reduce contamination risk. More future works are needed to fully discover the potential of microalgae for various metabolites production in different microalgae cultivation modes and systems.

TI  - CO2 bio-mitigation using genetically modified algae and biofuel production towards a carbon net-zero society
AB  - CO2 sequestration carried by biological methodologies shows enhanced potential and has the advantage that biomass produced from the captured CO2 can be used for different applications. Bio-mitigation of carbons through a micro-algal system addresses a promising and feasible option. This review mostly focused on the role of algae, particular mechanisms, bioreactors in algae cultivation, and genetically modified algae in CO2 fixation and energy generation systems. A combination of CO2 bio-mitigation and biofuel production might deliver an extremely promising alternative to current CO2 mitigation systems. Bio mitigation in which the excess carbon is captured and bio fixation which the carbon is captured by algae or autotrophs and used for producing biofuel. This review revealed that steps for biofuel production from algae include factors affecting, harvesting techniques, oil extraction and transesterification. This review helps environmentalists and researchers to assess the effect of algae-based biorefinery on the green environment. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Effects of mussel-kelp ratios in integrated mariculture on the carbon dioxide system in Sanggou Bay
AB  - The ocean is the largest carbon reservoir on Earth. The shellfish-seaweed mode of Integrated Multi-trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) can be optimized to enhance carbon removal from the sea. In this study, the effects of different mussel-kelp ratios (i.e. 6:3, 6:2, 6:1, 4:3, 4:2, 4:1, 2:3, 2:2, and 2:1) on water quality and the carbon dioxide (CO2) system were 6:3, 6:2, 6:1, 4:3, 4:2, 4:1, 2:3, 2:2, and 2:1, were investigated using experimental enclosures in Sanggou Bay, China. The results showed that the DO decreased significantly when ratios were 4:1, 6:2 and 6:1. With the exception of ratio 4:3, there was no significant change in pH in any treatment. The highest of DO, pH, and CO32- values occurred when the mussel-kelp ratio was 2:3, the highest proportion of kelp, while the lowest occurred in ratio 6:1, with the highest proportion of mussels. The highest levels of pCO(2), CO2 and HCO3- were observed in ratio 6:1, and the lowest when the ratio was 2:3. Both DIC and HCO3- significantly decreased by the end of the experiment for ratios 2:1 and 6:3, while the concentration of CO2 significantly decreased for ratios 2:3 and 6:3. Considering the measured parameters, the mussel-kelp ratios of 2:1, 2:2, 4:2 and 4:3 were identified as the best net carbon sinks with the smallest negative environmental impacts. This study revealed how the IMTA shellfish-seaweed modes can be optimized to mitigate ocean acidification using specific proportions of species.

TI  - Drivers of Atmosphere-Ocean CO2 Flux in Northern Norwegian Fjords
AB  - High-latitude fjords and continental shelves are shown to be sinks for atmospheric CO2, yet large spatial-temporal variability and poor regional coverage of sea-air CO2 flux data, especially from fjord systems, makes it difficult to scale our knowledge on how they contribute to atmospheric carbon regulation. The magnitude and seasonal variability of atmosphere-sea CO2 flux was investigated in high-latitude northern Norwegian coastal areas over 2018 and 2019, including four fjords and one coastal bay. The aim was to assess the physical and biogeochemical factors controlling CO2 flux and partial pressure of CO2 in surface water via correlation to physical oceanographic and biological measurements. The results show that the study region acts as an overall atmospheric CO2 sink throughout the year, largely due to the strong undersaturation of CO2 relative to atmospheric concentrations. Wind speed exerted the strongest influence on the instantaneous rate of sea-air CO2 exchange, while exhibiting high variability. We concluded that the northernmost fjords (Altafjord and Porsangerfjord) showed stronger potential for instantaneous CO2 uptake due to higher wind speeds. We also found that fixation of CO2 was likely a significant factor controlling Delta pCO(2) from April to June, which followed phenology of spring phytoplankton blooms at each location. Decreased Delta pCO(2) and the resulting sea-air CO2 flux was observed in autumn due to a combined reduction of the mixed layer with entrain of high CO2 subsurface water, damped biological activity and higher surface water temperatures. This study provides the first measurements of atmospheric CO2 flux in these fjord systems and therefore an important new baseline for gaining a better understanding on how the northern Norwegian coast and characteristic fjord systems participate in atmosphere carbon regulation.

TI  - Nutrient loading diminishes the dissolved organic carbon drawdown capacity of seagrass ecosystems
AB  - Seawater dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in seagrass meadows is gaining attention for its role in carbon sequestration. Abundant refractory compounds in DOC are exported by seagrass meadows to the deep sea, thereby contributing to long-term carbon drawdown. DOC lability and bacterioplankton communities are key determining factors in this carbon sequestration process, and it has been hypothesized that these may be affected by nutrient loading - however, scientific evidence is so far weak. Here, we studied the response of DOC composition and bacterioplankton communities to nutrient loading in seagrass meadows of the South China Sea. We found that increasing nutrient loads enhanced nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in DOC, which promoted algae blooms (Le. epiphyte, phytoplankton and macroalgae) in seagrass meadows, and presumably increased the lability of DOC and its bioavailability to microbes. Also, the relative abundance of K-strategist bacterioplankton communities with the potential to degrade refractory compounds (Acidimicrobiia, Verrucomicrobiales and Micrococcales) increased in the seagrass meadows exposed to high nutrient loads. These results suggest that high nutrient loading can enhance labile DOC composition, and thus increase refractory DOC remineralization rate, thereby weakening the DOC contribution potential of seagrass meadows to long-term carbon sequestration.

TI  - Kelp aquaculture in China: a retrospective and future prospects
AB  - Globally, China has the largest scale of kelp cultivation and production operations. However, its kelp aquaculture industry is suffering from declining germplasm diversity, degradation of agronomic traits, the presence of polluted environments, changing ocean conditions and increasing anthropological interference. This review covers two of the most commercially important kelp species in China, viz. Saccharina japonica and Undaria pinnatifida. It summarizes the history of their cultivation, production, economic and ecological benefits, their breeding programmes (e.g. inter- and intra-specific hybridization and marker-assisted selection) and efforts towards population genetic diversity and conservation. The article focuses on three significant challenges, for example genetic cross-contamination between the wild and farmed kelp populations, ocean warming and ocean acidification. Accordingly, we outline the steps required to provide several intervention measures, for example (i) collection and preservation of wild and cultivated kelp germplasm; (ii) selection of suitable cultivation sites under changing environmental conditions; (iii) developing stress-resistant cultivars; and finally, (iv) adoption of innovative cultivation models. The review concludes with genome-based, designs for molecular breeding and calls for the establishment of an East Asian Kelp Consortium (EAKC). Collectively, the Chinese kelp industry could provide beneficial goods and services, for example bioenergy to fine chemicals and environmental benefits, such as carbon capture, pH amelioration and provision of habitat for many other marine species of commercial value. The strategies proposed in this article thus have the potential to not only improve but also reinvigorate the kelp industry in China and nearby Japan and Korea, in the context of both environmental health and economic benefits.

TI  - State of biogeochemical blue carbon in South Asian mangroves
AB  - The efficiency of carbon (C) sequestration and its long-term storage by the mangroves and other shallow coastal habitats (like seagrass, tidal marsh, macroalgae) has been well recognized in mitigating climate change. Sediment is the largest reservoir of this sequestered C, also known as â€œblue C.â€ Blue C can be exported from sediment to the coastal water as dissolved or particulate form, or degraded to CO2 and release in the atmosphere, or it can be buried within the sediment for centuries to millennia. Other than discussing sedimentary C exchange processes in mangroves, we also reviewed current global database of blue C and identified South Asian countries as poor inventory despite a significant coverage (6.5%) and presence of worldâ€™s largest deltaic mangrove, the Sundarbans (~10, 000 km2). From data synthesis, blue C stock in South Asian mangroves is overall low compared to the neighboring South East (SE) Asian mangroves, that is due to less C% in sediment, low forest productivity, and nutrient limitation in the sediment. Application of stable isotopes, molecular biomarkers have been discussed to delineate sources of organic carbon (OC) in the sediment. Potential algal sources are recognized to contribute to sedimentary OC in southeastern India and Bangladesh mangroves, that could also explain their low C%, contrast to C-rich SE Asian mangroves where OC is largely of terrigenous origin. In the present discussion, C budget for the Indian Sundarbans has been revisited, that still warrants further investigations on biogeochemical sink processes (some aspects like benthic faunal production, fine root production, lithogenous or biogenous carbonate production, night-time benthic respiration). Lastly, we discussed on various aspects of blue C research to be undertaken in these mangrove ecosystems in future to fill the current gaps and challenges to develop better policies and how blue C research would help in conserving South Asian mangroves.

TI  - Seaweed resources of Korea
AB  - Korea has a long history of utilizing seaweeds, as the country has a high biodiversity of seaweeds. The abundance and composition of seaweed species have changed over the past decades due to climate change and anthropogenic influences. Some species showed a significant extension of their distribution range to the north while some species declined. Some areas have even become barren ground. Korea has put extensive effort into restoring the seaweed resources in these deforested areas. Korea is one of the most advanced countries in the World in terms of seaweed aquaculture. However, the aquacultured species are mostly limited to three genera, Saccharina, Undaria and Pyropia/Porphyra, which represent 96\% of the entire seaweed production in the country. Korea has developed highly advanced cultivation technologies as well as various cultivars using breeding and hybridization technologies for these species. There has also been considerable effort in developing environmentally sustainable aquaculture systems using seaweed cultivation (e. g. integrated multi-trophic aquaculture, nutrient bioextraction and biofloc). This study discusses the current status and challenges of the above mentioned topics in detail. In addition, the present study encourages South and North Korean scientists to collaborate in the study of seaweed resources at the border of these two countries.

TI  - TOWARDS THE TECHNOLOGY OF ALGAL EXTRACTS PRODUCTION
AB  - The aim of this work was to present a new technology of the preparation of raw marine biomass for supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) process. This paper presents the technological solution from the economic, technical and environmental viewpoints, as well as the analysis of the availability and the possibility of obtaining the biomass from the study area of the Baltic Sea in Sopot, Poland. The technological concept includes biomass collecting, transporting, drying, shredding and contamination removal. Depending on the applicability, different techniques of biomass collecting were evaluated. Presented methods concern the collection of the material directly from the seashore, which significantly reduces the sand content and prevents the organic matter from biological changes. An alternative is biomass collection from the beach, which requires additional procedures for the removal of natural contaminants as well as those of anthropogenic origin. In this study, we present the recommended and verified concept of technology for biomass collection in Sopot Municipalities different coastal types, the characterization of dominant algal species and assessment of biomass quantity. While the effectiveness of the SFE process, i.e. max. diffusion, strongly depends on particle size, water content and homogeneity of the material, further processing of the acquired biomass requires an efficient and cost-saving system. technological installation for the preparation of the biomass for the SFE process, demonstrated in this paper, is the set of appliances and equipment joined in the shredding-drying-granulating line with a theoretical maximum efficiency 5 Mg/h of the raw material. Thus obtained material meets the requirements of the supercritical fluid extraction process, which confirms the physical and chemical analyses. The early-stage system includes unwanted material removal, i.e. sand, woods, man-made debris, etc. One of the technological tasks of the installation is metal separation, which allows to remove all kinds of ferromagnetic metals but also stainless steel, brass, aluminium, and other similar materials, resulting in the protection of the processing machine. Next in line, low temperature drying system protects the material from temperature damage, i.e. loss of biological activity of the organic compounds in biomass, and assures the appropriate water content. The presented technological operations also include shredding of the materials in order to homogenise the particle size. The biomass is firstly loaded into the treatment vessel and subjected to mechanical agitation that initiates the physical breakdown of the organic material and the separation of the small particles, mainly sand, shells and others. The following parts of the system, the reversible fine slicing/shredding (larger pieces and other smaller pieces are shredded) guarantees the complete fragmentation of the material. The present paper includes studies of the market, studies of available technologies and using contractors for collection, transport and the storage of material.

TI  - Production of carbonic anhydrase by marine and freshwater microalgae
AB  - Microalgal biomass is a potentially attractive source of several bioproducts, such as carbonic anhydrase, the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the reversible hydration of CO2. This biomolecule has been studied for its application in enzymatic systems of CO2 capture and sequestration. Therefore, the aims of this study were to evaluate the production of carbonic anhydrase in the culture of marine and freshwater microalgae and to monitor the growth in terms of biomass and pH. The marine microalgae Dunaliella tertiolecta, Tetraselmis suecica, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Isochrysis galbana and Nannochloropsis oculata, and the freshwater microalgae Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus obliquus were cultured in Erlenmeyer flasks at 25 degrees C. The freshwater microalga that had the highest enzyme production was C. vulgaris: its maximum activity was 44.0 U/L. Among the marine microalgae, P. tricornutum stood out as the best producer, with a maximum activity of 19.9 U/L. In terms of specific activity, the highest values were obtained from D. tertiolecta (44.6 U/g) and P. tricornutum (24.5 U/g). These results show the potential of microalgae to produce the carbonic anhydrase enzyme. Microalgal biomass represents an attractive source of this biomolecule.

TI  - Elevated CO2 impact on growth and lipid of marine cyanobacterium Phormidium valderianum BDU 20041- towards microalgal carbon sequestration
AB  - The growth of marine cyanobacteria at elevated CO2 levels is one of the feasible means to bioremediate the greenhouse gases. The present paper describes a marine filamentous cyanobacterium Phormidium valderianum BDU 20041 that can grow at elevated CO2 levels (15\%), simulated and actual flue gas. Compared to ambient air and other tested CO2 concentrations, 3\% CO2 showed higher biomass productivity, growth rate and carbon fixation rate. The organism was able to tolerate 15\% CO2 and the simulated flue gas conditions making it a strong candidate for microalgal carbon capture. The lipid content of P. valderianum BDU 20041 at 15\% CO2, simulated and actual flue gas conditions was higher than the ambient air. The conditions tested, i.e. 15\% CO2, simulated and real flue gas show that this organism could be a potential entity in curbing carbon emission and a plausible biodiesel feedstock through hydrothermal liquefaction.

TI  - Substantial role of macroalgae in marine carbon sequestration
AB  - Vegetated coastal habitats have been identified as important carbon sinks. In contrast to angiosperm-based habitats such as seagrass meadows, salt marshes and mangroves, marine macroalgae have largely been excluded from discussions of marine carbon sinks. Macroalgae are the dominant primary producers in the coastal zone, but they typically do not grow in habitats that are considered to accumulate large stocks of organic carbon. However, the presence of macroalgal carbon in the deep sea and sediments, where it is effectively sequestered from the atmosphere, has been reported. A synthesis of these data suggests that macroalgae could represent an important source of the carbon sequestered in marine sediments and the deep ocean. We propose two main modes for the transport of macroalgae to the deep ocean and sediments: macroalgal material drifting through submarine canyons, and the sinking of negatively buoyant macroalgal detritus. A rough estimate suggests that macroalgae could sequester about 173 TgC yr(-1) (with a range of 61-268 TgC yr(-1)) globally. About 90\% of this sequestration occurs through export to the deep sea, and the rest through burial in coastal sediments. This estimate exceeds that for carbon sequestered in angiosperm-based coastal habitats.

TI  - Improving gaseous biofuel production from seaweed Saccharina latissima: The effect of hydrothermal pretreatment on energy efficiency
AB  - Marine macroalgae (seaweed) is a promising feedstock for producing biohydrogen and biomethane via dark fermentation and anaerobic digestion, respectively. However, one of the limiting steps in the biological process is the conversion of polymeric carbohydrates into monomeric sugars. Here hydrothermal pretreatments were assessed for hydrolysis and subsequent production of biohydrogen and biomethane from the brown seaweed Saccharina latissima. The solubilization of S. latissima improved with increasing temperatures from 100 to 180 degrees C, resulting in a maximum yield of 0.70 g soluble chemical oxygen demand/gram volatile solid (sCOD/g VS); equivalent to an increase of 207.5\% compared with untreated seaweed. However, the yield of the derived monomeric sugar mannitol peaked at 140 degrees C and decreased with increasing temperatures, likely due to production of fermentative inhibitors. Microstructural characterization revealed that the algal structure was significantly damaged, and the major chemical groups of carbohydrates and proteins were weakened after pretreatment. Regardless of hydrothermal temperatures, biohydrogen yield only slightly increased in dark fermentation, while biomethane yield significantly increased from 281.4 (untreated S. latissima) to 345.1 mL/g VS (treated at 140 degrees C), leading to the sCOD removal efficiency of 86.1\%. The maximum energy conversion efficiency of 72.8\% was achieved after two-stage biohydrogen and biomethane co-production. In comparison, considering the energy input for pretreatment/fermentation/digestion, the highest process energy efficiency dropped to 37.8\%. Further calculations suggest that a significant improvement of efficiency up to 56.9\% can be achieved if the heat from pretreatment can be recovered.

TI  - Production, Characterization and Observation of Higher Carbon in Sargassum wightii Biochar from Indian Coastal Waters
AB  - Seaweed farming gains significance as a climate resilient strategy owing to significant carbon sequestration potential and research advances to valorize products from seaweed resources. Conversion of seaweeds to biochar enhances further carbon sequestration. In this study Sargassum wightii, belonging to brown algae has been converted into biochar under different conditions of pyrolysis for possible application in aquaculture sector. The prepared biochar was subjected to elemental (CHNS) analysis to assess the nutrient profile. Further, comparative analysis has been done on raw seaweed and biochar based on the structural characterization using SEM, XRD and FTIR spectra. Functional group changes were evidenced from FTIR and XRD spectra, whereas surface modifications were elucidated by SEM analysis. The optimum temperature for biochar pyrolysis of S. wightii to yield higher carbon content has been identified. A significant observation is that seaweeds in Indian coastal waters are capable of higher carbon sequestration than in other waters. Â© Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2019.

TI  - The use of marine macroalgae as renewable energy source for reducing CO2 emissions
AB  - The mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions, agreed at the international level with the Kyoto Protocol, has not yet been fully implemented because of the difficulty of implementing the reduction such emissions. The existing debate on the emission/immission of carbon dioxide has increased the need to develop the use of alternative energy sources to carbon-based fossil fuels, as well as the development of technologies aimed at the disposal of carbon dioxide in natural fields. Reducing carbon dioxide by using renewable energy sources is one of the strategic approaches that has received the highest attention. The use of biomass, as a direct or indirect energy source, is one of the ways for combining expectations of increased use of energy for future development with the need for controlling the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In this paper, we discuss the results of our studies on selected species of marine macro-algae for the production, under mild energetic conditions, of biofuel, through the extraction of oils or any other material that may be assimilated as a liquid fuel, and their potential for CO2 capture and as a source of energy. The study was carried out comparing different extraction technologies, among which were SC-CO2 and solvent extraction. The extraction based on SC-CO2 is quite advantageous. SC-CO2 is not toxic and, as its critical temperature is quite close to room temperature, it could be also used for the extraction of thermo-labile compounds. The current cost of production of macro-algae is compared with that of micro-algae, for an economic use of marine biomass for energy production.

TI  - Decreased Irradiance and Nutrient Enrichment Mitigate the Negative Effect of Ocean Warming on Growth and Biochemical Compositions of a Canopy-Forming Marine Macroalga
AB  - Heatwaves under global warming have negative impacts on ecosystem primary producers. This warming effect may be synergized or antagonized by local environments such as light and nutrient availability. However, little is known about the interactive effects of warming, irradiance, and nutrients on physiology of marine macroalgae, which are dominant in coastal ecosystems. The present study examined the combined effects of warming (23 and 26 degrees C), irradiance (30 and 150 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1)), and nutrients (enriched and non-enriched) on specific growth rate (SGR) and biochemical compositions of the canopy-forming marine macroalga Sargassum fusiforme. The negative effect of warming on SGR and ratio of chlorophyll (Chl) c to Chl a was antagonized by decreased irradiance. Moreover, the negative effect of temperature elevation on carbon content was antagonized by nutrient enrichment. These results suggest that the effect of warming on the growth and carbon accumulation of this species can be mitigated by decreased irradiance and nutrient enrichment.

TI  - A parametric study of electrocoagulation as a recovery process of marine microalgae for biodiesel production
AB  - Microalgal biomass as feedstock for biofuel production is rapidly gaining appreciation in response to the increasing petroleum prices and the upsurge in global warming concerns. However, the process of creating concentrated biomass from microalgal cultures is limited by ineffective dewatering procedures. The economics of existing culture clarification unit operations make the process of creating biomass from microalgae unattractive for biofuel development. This work involves the comparison of the removal efficiency (recovery) of two marine microalgae species Chlorococcum sp. and Tetraselmis sp. by electrocoagulation (EC), a technique that has not been thoroughly explored in marine microalgae dewatering. High recovery efficiencies were obtained of up to 99 and 98% for Tetraselmis sp. and Chlorococcum sp., respectively. The effect of culture temperature and salinity on removal efficiency was also observed. A starting temperature of 60Â°C resulted in optimal recovery values of 96 and 94% for Chlorococcum sp. and Tetraselmis sp., respectively. Whereas a starting temperature of 5Â°C achieved optimal recovery of only 5 and 68% for Chlorococcum sp. and Tetraselmis sp., respectively. Increased salinity of microalgae culture showed increased microalgae recovery. Salinity of 20% gave optimal microalgae recovery values of only 6 and 9% for Chlorococcum sp. and Tetraselmis sp., respectively. Zeta potential (ZP) analysis was carried out to verify and further understand the charge neutralization mechanism due to Fe2+ cations. Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Techniques for harvesting, cell disruption and lipid extraction of microalgae for biofuel production
AB  - Microalgal biofuels are one of the best alternatives to replace the nonrenewable fossil fuels. Microalgae offer various advantages, the most beneficial being their high growth rate and ability to grow on waste waters. Many microalgal species have been assessed and studied for biofuel production, and have shown varying amounts of lipid contents. Harvesting the microalgae and extracting the stored lipids is a major hurdle for biofuel production technology, due to their tough cell walls. This review focuses on techniques for harvesting, cell disruption and lipid extraction of microalgae used for biofuel production.

TI  - Grazers extend blue carbon transfer by slowing sinking speeds of kelp detritus
AB  - Marine plant communities such as kelp forests produce significant amounts of detritus, most of which is exported to areas where it can constitute an important trophic subsidy or potentially be sequestered in marine sediments. Knowing the vertical transport speed of detrital particles is critical to understanding the potential magnitude and spatial extent of these linkages. We measured sinking speeds for Laminaria hyperborea detritus ranging from whole plants to small fragments and sea urchin faecal pellets, capturing the entire range of particulate organic matter produced by kelp forests. Under typical current conditions, we determined that this organic material can be transported 10 s of m to 10 s of km. We show how the conversion of kelp fragments to sea urchin faeces, one of the most pervasive processes in kelp forests globally, increases the dispersal potential of detritus by lto 2 orders of magnitude. Kelp detritus sinking speeds were also faster than equivalent phytoplankton, highlighting its potential for rapid delivery of carbon to deep areas. Our findings support arguments for a significant contribution from kelp forests to subsidizing deep sea communities and the global carbon sink.

TI  - Engineering a cultivation strategy for higher lipid accretion and biodiesel production by the marine microalga Picochlorum soloecismus
AB  - Microalgal-derived biofuels are currently paving the way towards sustainable and green energy generation. The current study targets to bring in multiway novelties in this direction through generating substantial biomass and lipid yields in a single cultivation cycle, lower experimental time, less chemical utilization and enhanced biodiesel quality. It also ensures higher cost-effectivity, mass applicability and promising annual outcomes. In the present work, a marine microalga Picochlorum soloecismus was subjected to an extensive range of macronutrient stresses to elevate its storage lipids. Amongst all the factors studied, 4 best parameters, i.e., concentrations of NaCl and nitrate, initial culture pH, and incubation period were optimized and a modified medium called Optimized ASN (Artificial Seawater Nutrient) was developed. This resulted in 3.4- and 5.3-fold higher lipid content and productivity, reduction in the experimental time from 18 days to 9 days alongside a diminution of 350- and 25-fold in the requirements of chemicals - NaCl and NaNO3. The reduction in chemical uptake consequently lowered the medium cost by 16-fold. The biomass loss after optimization was almost insignificant and a single-phase cultivation cycle presented 2.8-fold higher lipid productivity than a two-phase cycle. The biodiesel properties were validated with the mandatory biodiesel standards. At a pilot-scale projection, the optimized medium approximated annual lipid productivity of 19.5 t haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1 generated through 35 annual cultivation cycles. Eventually, the medium was tested on 10 different freshwater and marine microalgae where the positive response showed by all the strains proved its suitability as an efficient lipid promoting culture medium with mass applicability.

TI  - Biogeochemical feedbacks to ocean acidification in a cohesive photosynthetic sediment
AB  - Ecosystem feedbacks in response to ocean acidification can amplify or diminish diel pH oscillations in productive coastal waters. Benthic microalgae generate such oscillations in sediment porewater and here we ask how CO2 enrichment (acidification) of the overlying seawater alters these in the absence and presence of biogenic calcite. We placed a 1-mm layer of ground oyster shells, mimicking the arrival of dead calcifying biota (+Calcite), or sand (Control) onto intact silt sediment cores, and then gradually increased the pCO2 in the seawater above half of +Calcite and Control cores from 472 to 1216 Î¼atm (pH 8.0 to 7.6, CO2:HCO3âˆ’ from 4.8 to 9.6 Ã— 10âˆ’4). Porewater [O2] and [H+] microprofiles measured 16 d later showed that this enrichment had decreased the O2 penetration depth (O2-pd) in +Calcite and Control, indicating a metabolic response. In CO2-enriched seawater: (1) sediment biogeochemical processes respectively added and removed more H+ to and from the sediment porewater in darkness and light, than in ambient seawater increasing the amplitude of the diel porewater [H+] oscillations, and (2) in darkness, calcite dissolution in +Calcite sediment decreased the porewater [H+] below that in overlying seawater, reversing the sedimentâ€“seawater H+ flux and decreasing the amplitude of diel [H+] oscillations. This dissolution did not, however, counter the negative effect of CO2 enrichment on O2-pd. We now hypothesise that feedback to CO2 enrichmentâ€”an increase in the microbial reoxidation of reduced solutes with O2â€”decreased the sediment O2-pd and contributed to the enhanced porewater acidification.

TI  - Mangrove macroalgae increase their growth under ocean acidification: A study with Bostrychia (Rhodophyta) haplotypes from different biogeographic provinces
AB  - Increasing oceanic CO2 has caused a decrease in oceanic pH, a process termed ocean acidification (OA). OA may benefit fleshy macroalgae due to the increased availability of inorganic carbon sources for photosynthesis since they are tolerant of decreases in pH. In this study, we analyzed multiple physiological responses of Bostrychia montagnei and Bostrychia calliptera from two biogeographic provinces of Brazil (Tropical Southwestern Atlantic {[}TSA] and Warm Temperate Southwestern Atlantic {[}WTSA]) after culturing them at a set of bioreactors in three pH levels (7.2, 7.6, and 8.0). Two pH were decreased by CO2 enrichment into the culture medium. Molecular analyses using plastidial (rbcL-3P) and mitochondrial (COI-5P) DNA markers were also performed to identify genetic divergences between macroalgae from TSA and WTSA. Molecular evidence of COI-5P marker demonstrated that the specimens of both B. montagnei and B. calliptera from TSA and WTSA constitute different haplotypes, with a strong segregation between them. Macroalgae from both localities increased their growth in treatments of decreased pH with increased CO2 availability. Overall, physiological responses of the algae were not negatively affected by decreased pH. B. montagnei from TSA increased its polysaccharide and allophycocyanin content at pH 7.2, and B. montagnei from WTSA increased its low molecular weight carbohydrate content at pH 7.2 as well. Antioxidant activity - a proxy for physiological stress - was not affected by decreased pH. Our study indicates that haplotypes of B. montagnei and B. calliptera from TSA and WTSA can be relevant to CO2 sequestration in mangroves once they are tolerant of decreased pH and increase their growth under increased CO2 availability.

TI  - Spectroscopic analyses of chemical adaptation processes within microalgal biomass in response to changing environments
AB  - Via photosynthesis, marine phytoplankton transforms large quantities of inorganic compounds into biomass. This has considerable environmental impacts as microalgae contribute for instance to counter-balancing anthropogenic releases of the greenhouse gas CO2. On the other hand, high concentrations of nitrogen compounds in an ecosystem can lead to harmful algae blooms. In previous investigations it was found that the chemical composition of microalgal biomass is strongly dependent on the nutrient availability. Therefore, it is expected that algae's sequestration capabilities and productivity are also determined by the cells' chemical environments. For investigating this hypothesis, novel analytical methodologies are required which are capable of monitoring live cells exposed to chemically shifting environments followed by chemometric modeling of their chemical adaptation dynamics.FTIR-ATR experiments have been developed for acquiring spectroscopic time series of live Dunaliella parva cultures adapting to different nutrient situations. Comparing experimental data from acclimated cultures to those exposed to a chemically shifted nutrient situation reveals insights in which analyte groups participate in modifications of microalgal biomass and on what time scales. For a chemometric description of these processes, a data model has been deduced which explains the chemical adaptation dynamics explicitly rather than empirically. First results show that this approach is feasible and derives information about the chemical biomass adaptations. Future investigations will utilize these instrumental and chemometric methodologies for quantitative investigations of the relation between chemical environments and microalgal sequestration capabilities.

TI  - Cost-effective IMTA: a comparison of the production efficiencies of mussels and seaweed
AB  - This paper compares the biofilter capacity and cost-effectiveness of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and seaweed for use in integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) based on experiences in Ireland and Denmark. This comparison shows that weight for weight, mussels are a better biofilter than seaweed with regard to the amount of nitrogen assimilated. Furthermore, in optimized systems, areal requirement for mussels is similar to the cultivation of the same tonnage (1,000 t) of seaweed (approximately 8 ha). The cost-effectiveness of a mussel biofilter is a,not sign11-30 kg(-1) nitrogen (N) removed based on various examples compared to production costs of a,not sign209-672 removed and a,not sign1,013 kg(-1) N removed, respectively, for Laminaria digitata and Alaria esculenta from extrapolated laboratory and field trials. However, commercial seaweed (Saccharina latissima) producers claim that production costs are less than a,not sign10-38 kg(-1) N removed. These up-scaled and commercial figures make the seaweed cost competitive to mussels for removal of nitrogen. Disadvantages such as predators (e.g. eider ducks) and biofouling should also be taken into account before choice of biofilter is made. These drawbacks can reduce overall biofilter capacity and biomass value as a consequence of biomass spoilage or loss. However, disadvantages may be mitigated by seasonal choice of cultivation and harvest times. Cultivation technologies and harvesting methods may be improved together with breeding to improve the cost-efficiency of the biofilter, especially in the newer European seaweed cultivation. Furthermore, upscaling of IMTA to commercial proportions, other than the Danish example, would allow more real data on production costs and revenues.

TI  - Foam fractionator as a tool to remove dissolved organic matter and improve the flocculation of the marine microalga Nannochloropsis oceanica
AB  - Microalgae have great biotechnological potential, yet they are difficult to harvest. Flocculation is a promising technology, but the dissolved organic matter (DOM) released by microalgae during growth interacts with the flocculant, hindering the process. This DOM is composed mostly of proteins and carbohydrates which may present a polarity ranging from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. In aquaculture, foam fractionators are routinely employed to remove DOM from cultures, improving the water quality. However, this equipment has never been employed in microalgae cultures. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the use of the foam fractionator to remove DOM from a Nannochloropsis oceanica culture to improve the flocculation process. First, DOM accumulation was monitored for 33 days in a 330 L outdoor culture to characterize the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and protein and carbohydrate contents. Samples from logarithmic (day 13) and stationary (day 29) growth phases were fractionated by polarity (hydrophobic, transphilic, and hydrophilic), the DOC and protein and carbohydrate contents of each fraction were measured, and flocculation was performed. Then the culture was treated with a foam fractionator at bench (11 L) and pilot scales (1600 L), and the composition and flocculation were compared with the non-treated culture. Proteins strongly hindered flocculation, and the foam fractionator was effective in removing this element and significantly improved the flocculation efficiency. Furthermore, N. oceanica cell integrity was not affected by the foam fractionator. These results indicate that DOM can be efficiently removed by foam fractionation, improving the microalgae harvesting process.

TI  - Impacts of nutrient competition on microalgae biomass production
AB  - Marine microalgae cells are key environmental players as they transform inorganic nutrients dissolved in oceans into biomass. Most prominent among these inorganic compounds is bicarbonate, which originates in considerable quantities from atmospheric CO2, a potent greenhouse gas. Because microalgae cells act as a sink of anthropogenic CO2, understanding phytoplankton's carbon sequestration is a crucial link between environmental chemistry and ecology. The impact of ambient chemical and physical parameters onto phytoplankton and their chemical composition have been investigated in some detail. However, speciesspecies interactions, namely their nutrient competition, require in-depth investigations of the impact of competing species on the dynamics of biomass production as well as the amount of biomass produced. Experimental studies presented here have been based on two marine microalgae species, that is, Nannochloropsis oculata and Dunaliella parva. For investigating dynamic aspects of biomass production, the species growth rates have been measured, under otherwise identical conditions, in single-species cultures as well as in competition situations. Depending on the species and nutrient type the cells compete for, growth rates in species mixtures were found to change from 50\% to 200\% of the corresponding single-species cultures. Competition impacts regarding the maximum cell concentration in a culture were even more drastic as the cell production was reduced, in some cases, down to 11\% of the corresponding single-cell culture's growth rate. Furthermore, a slight but significant shift in cell size distributions toward smaller cell sizes was found in competition situations. This study demonstrates that biomass production is also driven by the cells' biological environment. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd. This study investigates impacts of competition among microalgae species for inorganic nutrients, namely bicarbonate, nitrate, and ammonium. It was found that nutrient competition has a considerable influence on the microalgae culture's growth rates, maximum sustainable cell concentration, and cell size distributions. This is of relevance for improving the understanding of the microalgae's role in balancing the atmosphere CO2 concentration by means of sequestering of inorganic nutrients, namely bicarbonate, into biomass.

TI  - Ocean acidification and seaweed reproduction: increased CO2 ameliorates the negative effect of lowered pH on meiospore germination in the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera (Laminariales, Phaeophyceae)
AB  - The worldwide effects of ocean acidification (OA) on marine species are a growing concern. In temperate coastal seas, seaweeds are dominant primary producers that create complex habitats and supply energy to higher trophic levels. Studies on OA and macroalgae have focused on calcifying species and adult stages, but critically, they have overlooked the microscopic stages of the reproductive life cycle, which, for other anthropogenic stressors, e.g., UV-B radiation, are the most susceptible life-history phase. Also, environmental cues and stressors can cause changes in the sex ratio, which has implications for the mating system and recruitment success. Here, we report the effects of pH (7.598.50) on meiospore germination and sex determination for the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera (Laminariales), in the presence and absence of additional dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Lowered pH (7.597.60, using HCl-only) caused a significant reduction in germination, whereas added DIC had the opposite effect, indicating that increased CO2 at lower pH ameliorates physiological stress. This finding also highlights the importance of appropriate manipulation of seawater carbonate chemistry when testing the effects of OA on photosynthetic organisms. The proportion of male to female gametophytes did not vary significantly between treatments, suggesting that pH was not a primary environmental modulator of sex. Relative to the baseline (pH 8.19), gametophytes were 32\% larger under moderate OA (pH 7.86) and 10\% larger under extreme OA (pH 7.61). We suggest that metabolically active cells can compensate for the acidification of seawater. This homeostatic function minimizes the negative effects of lower pH (high H+ ions) on cellular activity. The 69\% reduction in germination success under extreme OA suggests that meiospores of M. pyrifera may be resistant to future OA.

TI  - Microalgal industry in China: challenges and prospects
AB  - Over the past 15 years, China has become the major producer of microalgal biomass in the world. Spirulina (Arthrospira) is the largest microalgal product by tonnage and value, followed by Chlorella, Dunaliella, and Haematococcus, the four main microalgae grown commercially. China's production is estimated at about two-thirds of global microalgae biomass of which roughly 90 \% is sold for human consumption as human nutritional products ('nutraceuticals'), with smaller markets in animal feeds mainly for marine aquaculture. Research is also ongoing in China, as in the rest of the world, for other high-value as well as commodity microalgal products, from pharmaceuticals to biofuels and CO2 capture and utilization. This paper briefly reviews the main challenges and potential solutions for expanding commercial microalgae production in China and the markets for microalgae products. The Chinese Microalgae Industry Alliance (CMIA), a network founded by Chinese microalgae researchers and commercial enterprises, supports this industry by promoting improved safety and quality standards, and advancement of technologies that can innovate and increase the markets for microalgal products. Microalgae are a growing source of human nutritional products and could become a future source of sustainable commodities, from foods and feeds, to, possibly, fuels and fertilizers.

TI  - A pilot study on remediation of sediments enriched by oyster farming wastes using granulated coal ash
AB  - In order to evaluate the ability of granulated coal ash (GCA), a byproduct of coal thermal electric power stations, to remove hydrogen sulfide from organically enriched sediments, a pilot study was carried out at oyster farming sites, where sediments were enriched with oyster feces and dead oysters. Concentration of hydrogen sulfide in the interstitial water of the sediment decreased to nearly zero in both experimental sites, whereas it remained over 0.2. mg/l in the control site. Concentration of acid volatile sulfide (AVS) in the sediment also decreased significantly in both experimental sites, while remained over 0.4. mg/g in the control site. Increases were observed in both the number of benthic microalgae species and the individual number of benthic animals in the surface sediments.

TI  - Carbon dioxide fixation by the seaweed Gracilaria lemaneiformis in integrated multi-trophic aquaculture with the scallop Chlamys farreri in Sanggou Bay, China
AB  - The red alga Gracilaria lemaneiformis was cultivated with the scallop Chlamys farreri in an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) system for 42 h at Sanggou Bay, located in north China. Variation in inorganic carbon in the IMTA system was determined. The experiment included three treatments each with three replicates and three scallop monoculture systems as controls. Scallop density (399.1 +/- A 7.85 g per microcosm) remained the same in all treatments while seaweed density differed. The seaweed density was set at three levels (treatments 1, 2, 3) with thallus wet weights of 125.3 +/- A 4.72 g, 252.3 +/- A 7.50 g, and 378.7 +/- A 6.51 g per microcosm, respectively. This produced bivalve to seaweed wet weight ratios of 1:0.31, 1:0.63, and 1:0.96 for treatments 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In control groups, continuous dissolution of carbon dioxide (CO2) produced by scallops into the seawater not only caused an ongoing increase in partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)), 5.5 times higher than that of natural seawater, but also acidified seawater by 0.8 units after 42 h of culture. However, in all seaweed-scallop groups, the higher the algal density, the more CO2 was absorbed; pCO(2) was lowest in treatment 3. The results suggest that a ratio of bivalve to seaweed less than 1:0.96 may produce an even stronger CO2 sink. Overall, the integrated culture of seaweed and scallop could provide an efficient and environmentally friendly means to reduce CO2 emissions from bivalve mariculture.

TI  - Carbon self-utilization may assist Caulerpa taxifolia invasion
AB  - Additions of 13C-labeled macroalgal detritus (Caulerpa taxifolia) and seagrass detritus (Zostera capricorni) to a vegetated intertidal mudflat in subtropical Australia provided insight into the mechanisms and ecosystem effects of C. taxifolia invasions in seagrass beds. Despite the high lability typical of macroalgae, carbon from seagrass detritus was removed from sediments and transferred to benthic compartments (microphytobenthos, bacteria, mud whelks, and live C. taxifolia and Z. capricorni) at a faster rate than carbon from macroalgal detritus. This preference was more pronounced for live Z. capricorni than live C. taxifolia. Whereas rates of dissolved inorganic carbon production and utilization were similar for seagrass and macroalgal detritus, higher fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from macroalgal detritus early in the experiment reflected the lower utilization of this carbon pool. Although both seagrass and algae can use DOC as a source of carbon, caulerpenyne may comprise part of the DOC pool leached from C. taxifolia detritus during early degradation. This compound can have allelopathic effects on seagrass and may, therefore, be inaccessible to Z. capricorni. The availability of an additional carbon source for C. taxifolia, generated from its own detritus, represents a competitive advantage for this invasive macroalga over existing seagrass, particularly because seagrass productivity can be carbon-limited. A similar mechanism may exist for other species of invasive macroalga, particularly those that produce toxic secondary metabolites.

TI  - Germplasm banking of the giant kelp: Our biological insurance in a changing environment
AB  - Genetic diversity is being lost at a fast pace - seaweeds are no exception. The giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, forms vast underwater forests in both hemispheres and is a key species for ecosystem functioning. But this species is also a commodity product. M. pyrifera is harvested for its chemical compounds (e.g. alginates) and for feedstock (e.g. abalone). In the past 5 years, some companies tried new farming techniques to boost biomass production for biofuel conversion. But the lack of sustainable management can lead to genetic erosion and degradation of livelihoods. Often, the natural genetic populations are not described, and we may be losing what is yet to be found. Aiming to alert and prevent this situation, we developed a germplasm bank based on the genetic diversity of M. pyrifera from Chile. We preserved female and male gametophytes in separate, from 3 genetic populations in low light, at 10 degrees C, in Provasoli media but without cryoprotective agents. After 5 years in cold storage, we show for the first time gametophyte viability up to 89\% and viability differences between genetic populations. We discuss the benefits of this germplasm bank considering sustainability of seaweed production, food security pressures, and climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Biomethane production kinetics during the anaerobic co-digestion of Sargassum spp. and food waste using batch and fed-batch systems in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic
AB  - Collecting Sargassum spp. biomass and using it for the generation of renewable energy is a sustainable approach to mitigate the costs associated to this weed management. The biomethanation of this algal biomass with other organic waste to produce biogas promotes the integrated sustainable management of these materials while generating gaseous fuel for the tourism industry. The purpose of this work is to determine the percentage Sargassum spp. biomass during the anaerobic co-digestion of this brown algae with food waste that results in the best biogas composition, methane yield, production kinetics, and digestate. The biomethanation was conducted in 1200 L fed-batch and bench scale batch biodigestors and the kinetic parameters were estimated using the modified Gompertz model. The methane yield of Sargassum spp. and food waste combinations in 0.58 OLR at fed batch and 15 g/L organic load at batch were comparable. The methane yield produced in the 100\% Sargassum spp. fed-batch anaerobic biodigester was 101.3 +/- 23.6 N. L CH4/kg, but up to 615.5 +/- 78.4 N. L CH4/kg in the 45\% Sargassum spp. / 55\% food waste biodigestor. The anaerobic co-digestion of Sargassum spp. and food waste in the batch system showed methane production rates as high as 14.6 +/- 0.3 N.L CH4/kg.day. Higher H2S were detected in the biogas of the biodigesters fed with larger percentages of the Sargassum spp. with more than 5000 ppm during mono-digestion. Our results suggest that 55\% Sargassum spp. and 45\% food waste are the most promising feed combination under the studied conditions for the anaerobic co-digestion of these feedstock at larger scale.

TI  - Variability in the Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP) of Seaweed Farms
AB  - The important role of vegetated ecosystems in the sequestration of carbon has gained strong interest across a wide variety of disciplines. With evidence growing of the potential for macroalgae ecosystems to capture carbon, there is burgeoning interest in applying newfound knowledge of carbon capture rates to better understand the potential for carbon sequestration. Seaweed farms are expected to play a significant role in carbon capture; advocates for the expansion of seaweed farms are increasing in many countries. In general, seaweed farms are expected to be highly productive, although whether they are autotrophic or heterotrophic ecosystems and hence potential exporters of carbon, is under debate. Therefore, we present our investigation of three seaweed farms, two in northern Japan and one in southern Japan. We examine the frequency of autotrophic days and compare potential rates of carbon capture of the seaweed farms with two natural macroalgae ecosystems and one degraded site. We estimated potential carbon capture rates by calculating the net ecosystem productivity from continuous recordings of dissolved oxygen concentrations under natural environmental conditions. The net ecosystem production rates for the natural ecosystems in Arikawa Bay and Omura Bay were equivalent to 0.043 and 0.054 [g C m-2 d-1] m-1, respectively. Whereas, for the degraded ecosystem in Tainoura Bay, it was -0.01 [g C m-2 d-1] m-1. We reveal that the Undaria pinnatifida farm in Matsushima Bay experience autotrophy more often than natural ecosystems, although for seaweed farms producing U. pinnatifida in Hirota Bay and Cladospihon okamuranus at Bise Point, autotrophy was less frequently observed. Nevertheless, up to 14.1 g C m-2 (0.110 g C m-2 d-1) was captured by the production of U. pinnatifida and 3.6 g C m-2 (0.034 g C m-2 d-1) was captured by C. okamuranus, and the total yield of carbon captured during 2021 production season for these farms was 43,385 kg C.

TI  - Evaluation of nutrient bioextraction by seaweed and shellfish aquaculture in Korea
AB  - Although Korea is third in seaweed production and second in shellfish production globally, this is the first study evaluating ecosystem services of seaweed and shellfish aquaculture in Korea. The objective of this study is to evaluate nutrient bioextraction capacities of major seaweed and shellfish species aquacultured in Korea. C (C) removal of three major aquacultured seaweed species, Neopyropia yezoensis, Saccharina japonica, and Undaria pinnatifida were 24,247, 8,423, and 12,758 tons, respectively, in 2016. N (N) removal of these species was 4,088, 732, and 1,244 tons, respectively. The C and N removal of the Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) were 14,693 and 1,050 tons, respectively. Manila clams (Venerupis philippinarum) removed 2,120 tons of C and 136.5 tons of N. Together, 161,846 tons of CO2 and 7,251 tons of N were removed by three major seaweed species and two shellfish species. These values are significant amounts, equivalent to 5.7\% of CO2 and 8.6\% of N discharged from all wastewater treatment plants in Korea. These results suggest that nutrient bioextraction by aquacultured seaweed and shellfish can be a cost efficient, affordable, and equitable solution for coastal nutrient management programs in Korea and elsewhere.

TI  - Potential advancement of ultraviolet-free solar radiation technology in enriching the nutrient composition and biodiesel feedstock production in marine green microalga Platymonas subcordiformis
AB  - Outdoor cultivation was carried out on a site very near to the Tropic of Cancer (23Â°26â€²21.45â€³) to investigate the effects of solar radiation on the growth, nutrient composition and biodiesel feedstock production of a marine green microalga Platymonas subcordiformis. During a 7-day period of exposure to sunlight in the winter, ultraviolet-free solar radiation (UVFSR) significantly increased the accumulation of total carotenoids and individual carotenoids including zeaxanthin, fucoxanthin and violaxanthin in P. subcordiformis when compared with the full spectrum solar radiation (FSSR). UVFSR treatment also resulted in significantly higher levels of palmitoleic acid, a main biodiesel feedstock, and eicosapentaenoic acid in the microalga than that of FSSR. Removal of the ultraviolet spectrum from the solar radiation (UVFSR technology) show its potential advantage for increasing the production of microalgal nutrient components including carotenoids and specific polyunsaturated fatty acids, as well as biodiesel feedstock, for the applications of attractive bioresources.

TI  - Variability and control of carbon consumption, export, and accumulation in marine communities
AB  - Elucidating the extent and controls of the routes followed by primary production in marine communities (i.e., consumption by herbivores, decomposition, transportation of plant material beyond the community boundaries referred to as export-or accumulation as biomass or detritus) is essential to understand how much and why they differ in their capacity to fuel secondary production, both within or out of the community, and in their role as sinks in the oceanic carbon budget. Here, using an extensive compilation of published reports, I compare the magnitude of these routes across and within a wide range of community types, including oceanic and coastal phytoplanktonic communities, benthic microalgal communities, coral reef algal beds, macroalgal beds, seagrass meadows, marshes, and mangroves. Furthermore, I examine whether the variability in the magnitude of these routes among and within types is associated with that in the magnitude of primary production. In general, different community types showed similar levels of consumption by herbivores and export, in spite of substantial within-type variability. On the contrary, substantial differences in detritus decomposition and accumulation were found among types: coral reef algal beds and benthic microalgal communities tended to show the highest and lowest levels of decomposition, respectively, whereas marshes and oceanic phytoplanktonic communities tended to show the largest and smallest levels of detritus accumulation. The results also identify primary production as a robust (i.e., applicable to a wide range of environmental conditions and communities) control of the variability in herbivory and decomposition among marine communities. The role of primary production as a control of export and detritus accumulation is generally minor and only restricted to coastal phytoplanktonic and benthic microalgal communities, for export, and marshes and mangroves for detritus accumulation.

TI  - Examining the production, export, and immediate fate of kelp detritus on open-coast subtidal reefs in the Northeast Atlantic
AB  - Kelp forests are highly productive coastal habitats and are emerging as important sources of organic matter for other ecosystems. Although their high rates of productivity and detritus release are expected to lead to substantial export of carbon, few studies have actually quantified rates of export or the persistence of detritus. We addressed this in eight subtidal kelp forests (Laminaria hyperborea) spanning the length (9Â° of latitude) of the United Kingdom. Specifically, we quantified detritus production, retention/export from source and adjacent habitats, and in situ decomposition rates. Detritus released via both dislodgment of whole plants and â€œMay castâ€ shedding of old growth was highly variable between sites with greatest values recorded in our colder, northern sites. This was attributable to greater plant size biomass in northern regions, rather than plant density or dislodgement rates. On average, the annual production of kelp detritus was 4706 Â± 700 g FW mâˆ’2Â yrâˆ’1 or 301 g C mâˆ’2Â yrâˆ’1. Low retention of detritus within the kelp forest and adjacent sedimentary habitats indicated very high rates of export (&gt; 98% across the study). A litterbag experiment showed detritus may take &gt; 4Â months to decompose, suggesting great potential for long distance transport. Overall, our findings suggest that L. hyperborea forests export large amounts of detritus subsidies across their range, which can potentially shape the structure of distant benthic communities and constitute a relevant and largely overlooked flux in the coastal carbon cycle, which may represent an important component of natural carbon sequestration.

TI  - Primary production, calcification, and air-sea CO2 fluxes of a macroalgal-dominated coral reef community (Moorea, French Polynesia)
AB  - Community metabolism and air-sea carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were investigated in July 1992 on a fringing reef at Moorea (French Polynesia). The benthic community was dominated by macroalgae (85% substratum cover) and comprised of Phaeophyceae Padina tenuis (Bory), Turbinaria ornata (Turner) J. Agardh, and Hydroclathrus clathratus Bory (Howe); Chlorophyta Halimeda incrassata f. ovata J. Agardh (Howe); and Ventricaria ventricosa J. Agardh (Olsen et West), as well as several Rhodophyta (Actinotrichia fragilis Forskal (Borgesen) and several species of encrusting coralline algae). Algal biomass was 171 g dry weightÂ·m-2. Community gross production (P(g)), respiration (R), and net calcification (G) were measured in an open top enclosure. P(g) and R were respectively 248 and 240 mmol CO2Â·m-2Â·d-1, and there was a slight net dissolution of CaCO3 (0.8 mmolÂ·m-2Â·d-1). This site was a sink for atmospheric CO2 (10 Â± 4 mmol CO2Â·m-2Â·d-1), and the analysis of data from the literature suggests that this is a general feature of algal-dominated reefs. Measurement of air-sea CO2 fluxes in open water close to the enclosure demonstrated that changes in small-scale hydrodynamics can lead to misleading conclusions. Net CO2 evasion to the atmosphere was measured on the fringing reef due to changes in the current pattern that drove water from the barrier reef (a CO2 source) to the study site.

TI  - High density cultivation and CO2 uptake by panel arrays of the macrophytic red alga Gracilaria vermiculophylla in a 100 L raceway pond
AB  - New approaches are needed for land-based cultivation of macrophytic red algae that reduce costly aeration requirements for biomass suspension and enable high-density cultivation. The goal of this study was to demonstrate the high-density cultivation of the carbohydrate-rich macrophytic red alga Gracilaria vermiculophylla on vertical arrays of panels deployed in an open channel raceway configuration similar to those developed for mass cultivation of microalgae. A clonal culture of G. vermiculophylla, consisting of branched, cylindrical thallus tissues of 8-10 cm length, was mechanically blended using a Waring blender into 2-3 cm fragments and then fluidically injected onto a 3 mm polypropylene mesh support. Immobilized G. vermiculophylla mesh panels were spaced 6.5 cm apart and aligned parallel to flowing seawater medium at nominal bulk velocity of 20 cm s(-1) in a 100 L raceway pond of 20 cm liquid depth. This raceway was equipped with real-time measurement of CO2 concentration in the inlet and outlet gas for determination of CO2 uptake dynamics. Specific rates for CO2 uptake became saturated at 8000 ppm CO2. To match CO2 demand by the biomass under nutrient-replete conditions at 21 degrees C, the inlet gas CO2 was increased from 1000 to 4000 ppm (day 7-14), and then to 8000 ppm (day 14-23) at 0.010 L gas L-1 liquid min(-1) gas flow. Over the 23 day cultivation, biomass on the panel increased by a factor of 48, with final biomass loading exceeding 10 kg FW m(-2) panel area, and cumulative CO2 capture of 65\%. The cumulative average areal productivity within the panel zone of the raceway exceeded 60 g AFDW m(-2) day(-1), and final biomass density nearing 7.2 g AFDW L-1 (47 g FW L-1) was achieved after 23 days. Overall, these outcomes demonstrate the potential for land-based raceway cultivation of clonal red macroalgae of present and future commercial significance.

TI  - Reduced water motion enhances organic carbon stocks in temperate eelgrass meadows
AB  - Organic carbon (OC) storage in coastal vegetated ecosystems is increasingly being considered in carbon financing and climate change mitigation strategies. However, spatial heterogeneity in these ``blue carbon{''} stocks among and within habitats has only recently been examined, despite its considerable implications. Seagrass meadows have potential to store significant amounts of carbon in their sediments, yet studies comparing sediment OC content at regional and meadow scales remain sparse. Here, we collected sediment cores from six temperate eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows on the coast of British Columbia, Canada, to quantify sediment OC stocks, accumulation rates, and sources, and to examine local and regional drivers of variability. Sediment OC content was highly variable-across all sites, stocks in the top 0-5 cm ranged from 83 to 1089 g OC m(-2), while the 15-20 cm stocks exhibited a 24-fold difference, from 59 to 1407 g OC m(-2). Carbon accumulation rates ranged from 4 to 33 g OC m(-2) yr(-1). Isotopic mixing models revealed that sediment OC was primarily terrestrial carbon (41.3\%) and canopy-forming kelps (33.3\%), with a smaller contribution of eelgrass (25.3\%). Here, we show that regional variability in OC content exceeds meadow-scale variability. This result is likely driven by landscape factors, most notably relative water motion, representing a more dominant control on seagrass OC accumulation than meadow-scale factors such as canopy complexity. These findings elicit caution when scaling up seagrass meadow OC content and demonstrate that measures of the hydrodynamic environment could improve estimates of carbon storage in temperate soft sediment habitats.

TI  - Dynamic metabolic profiling of the marine microalga Chlamydomonas sp. JSC4 and enhancing its oil production by optimizing light intensity Luisa Gouveia
AB  - Background: Marine microalgae are among the most promising lipid sources for biodiesel production because they can be grown on nonarable land without the use of potable water. Marine microalgae also harvest solar energy efficiently with a high growth rate, converting CO2 into lipids stored in the cells. Both light intensity and nitrogen availability strongly affect the growth, lipid accumulation, and fatty acid composition of oleaginous microalgae. However, very few studies have systematically examined how to optimize lipid productivity by adjusting irradiance intensity, and the metabolic dynamics that may lead to improved lipid accumulation in microalgae have not been elucidated. Little is known about the mechanism of lipid synthesis regulation in microalgae. Moreover, few studies have assessed the potential of using marine microalgae as oil producers. Results: In this work, a newly isolated marine microalga, Chlamydomonas sp. JSC4, was selected as a potential lipid producer, and the effect of photobioreactor operations on cell growth and lipid production was investigated. The combined effects of light intensity and nitrogen depletion stresses on growth and lipid accumulation were further explored in an effort to markedly improve lipid production and quality. The optimal lipid productivity and content attained were 312 mg L-1 d-1 and 43.1% per unit dry cell weight, respectively. This lipid productivity is the highest ever reported for marine microalgae. Metabolic intermediates were profiled over time to observe transient changes during lipid accumulation triggered by combined stresses. Finally, metabolite turnover was also assessed using an in vivo 13C-labeling technique to directly measure the flow of carbon during lipid biosynthesis under stress associated with light intensity and nitrogen deficiency. Conclusions: This work demonstrates the synergistic integration of cultivation and dynamic metabolic profiling technologies to develop a simple and effective strategy for enhancing oil production in a marine microalga. The knowledge obtained from this study could be useful in assessing the feasibility of marine microalgae biodiesel production and for understanding the links between dynamic metabolic profiles and lipid biosynthesis during the course of microalgal cultivation.

TI  - Optimization of CO2 bio-mitigation by Chlorella vulgaris
AB  - Biofixation of CO2 by microalgae has been recognized as an attractive approach to CO2 mitigation. The main objective of this work was to maximize the rate of CO2 fixation (RCO2) by the green microalga Chlorella vulgaris P12 cultivated photoautotrophically in bubble column photobioreactors under different CO2 concentrations (ranging from 2% to 10%) and aeration rates (ranging from 0.1 to 0.7vvm). Results showed that the maximum RCO2 (2.22gL-1d-1) was obtained by using 6.5% CO2 and 0.5vvm after 7days of cultivation at 30Â°C. Although final biomass concentration and maximum biomass productivity of microalgae were affected by the different cultivation conditions, no significant differences were obtained in the biochemical composition of microalgal cells for the evaluated levels of aeration and CO2. The present study demonstrated that optimization of microalgal cultivation conditions can be considered a useful strategy for maximizing CO2 bio-mitigation by C. vulgaris. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Geographical considerations for capturing value in the U.S. sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima) industry
AB  - The United Statesâ€™ seaweed industry is worth over $300 million annually thanks in part to the rising popularity of seaweed-based products. Seaweed has myriad uses and great potential for novel product innovation and development while also providing numerous environmental benefits including carbon and nitrogen sequestration and other crucial ecosystem services. One of the most promising and prevalent species under domestic cultivation is Saccharina latissma. Also known as sugar kelp, this abundantly grown cold-water species dominates the edible seaweed market in the United States. This paper provides an in-depth geographical analysis of the current state of the U.S. sugar kelp industry, comparing regional market differences and opportunities for growth in Maine, Alaska, and Connecticut. Data was collected from the 2020 National Sea Grant Seaweed Symposium (https://seaweedhub.org/symposium/) and through a series of semi-structured interviews with key industry participants, yielding insights into the challenges that seaweed stakeholders face across the country. Proposed solutions for increasing the profitability of sugar kelp are explored and include market differentiation through regional origin labels, eco-labels, and quality labels. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Methane emissions offset atmospheric carbon dioxide uptake in coastal macroalgae, mixed vegetation and sediment ecosystems
AB  - Coastal ecosystems can efficiently remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and are thus promoted for nature-based climate change mitigation. Natural methane (CH4) emissions from these ecosystems may counterbalance atmospheric CO2 uptake. Still, knowledge of mechanisms sustaining suchÂ CH4 emissions and their contribution to net radiative forcing remains scarce for globally prevalent macroalgae, mixed vegetation, and surrounding depositional sediment habitats. Here we show that these habitats emit CH4 in the range of 0.1 â€“ 2.9 mg CH4 mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1 to the atmosphere, revealing in situ CH4 emissions from macroalgae that wereÂ sustained by divergent methanogenic archaea in anoxic microsites. Over an annual cycle, CO2-equivalent CH4 emissions offset 28 and 35% of the carbon sink capacity attributed to atmospheric CO2 uptake in the macroalgae and mixed vegetation habitats, respectively, and augment net CO2 release of unvegetated sediments by 57%. Accounting for CH4 alongside CO2 sea-air fluxes and identifying the mechanisms controlling these emissions is crucial to constrain the potential of coastal ecosystems as net atmospheric carbon sinks and develop informed climate mitigation strategies.

Sustaining natural populations of seaweeds under climate change while simultaneously putting sea weeds to use in climate solutions requires that we weave together disparate lines of inquiry-the ecological and the industrial-to create a more holistic perspective and integrated research agenda. Innovation in the use of seaweeds must be more than aspirational-it requires evidence of effectiveness in the short term, and a promise to sustain nature and people in the long term.

AB  - Seaweed bioethanol technology is being developed to mitigate climate change and to overcome economic and environmental drawbacks that terrestrial bioethanol has: biomass demand competition for food and energy, and land-use change impacts. To investigate whether seaweed bioethanol is better than terrestrial bioethanol, we compare the global warming potentials (GWPs) of seaweed and terrestrial bioethanols from a life cycle perspective including land-related GWP effects from carbon debt, soil carbon sequestration, and N2O emission. Our results demonstrated that seaweed bioethanol has lower GWP in the long term than terrestrial bioethanols from corn grain, corn stover, and switchgrass, primarily because seaweed cultivation does not consume fertilizers and incur carbon debt and N2O emission. It was noted that future R\&D strategy for low-carbon seaweed bioethanol needs to be directed to developing biomaterial-based cultivation equipment and reusing existing equipment, as well as enhancing bioethanol conversion yield and biomass productivity. Due to the vast sea available for seaweed cultivation, seaweed bioethanol could significantly contribute to mitigating climate change.

TI  - pH induced stress enhances lipid accumulation in microalgae grown under mixotrophic and autotrophic condition
AB  - Production of biodiesel together with wastewater treatment and CO2 sequestration is a promising technology. The growing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increase the amount of dissolved CO2 in natural watercourses, triggering the increase in concentrations of bicarbonate and hydrogen ions while dropping those of carbonate and hydroxyl ions. The active carbon cycling in coastal areas, which can result in periodic and daily fluctuations in pH and CO2 concentrations that may surpass those anticipated for the extensive marine ecosystems, is regarded as one of the consequences of climate change. Studies were conducted to examine the effects of various pH levels on algal growth and lipid production in order to better understand how the growth of algae may be influenced in such conditions. In the present study, the influence of three different pH levels (6, 8, and 10) was studied to evaluate microalgaeâ€™s carbohydrate utilisation and lipid accumulation during the operationâ€™s starvation phase (SP). Microalgae, in the study, were cultivated in two modes, namely mixotrophic [growth phase (GP)] and autotrophic [pH-induced (SP)] conditions. Enhancement in biomass formation, and intracellular carbohydrate accumulation were recorded during the GP operation, while noticeable lipid productivities (Total/neutral, 26.93/10.3%) were observed during SP operation at pH 8. Pigment analysis showed variations in both the procedures where higher Chl a concentration was noticed in GP, and higher Chl b was detected during SP. Nile red fluorescent staining strongly supports the existence of intracellular lipid bodies (LB). GC analysis of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) showed the existence of a substantial amount of saturated fatty acids (SFA) compared with unsaturated fatty acids (USFA). Efficient wastewater treatment with nutrient assimilation was reported during the GP operation, demonstrating the phyco-remediation. Copyright Â© 2022 Alkhamis, Mathew, Nagarajan, Rahman and Rahman.

TI  - Coastal blue carbon: Concept, study method, and the application to ecological restoration
AB  - Coastal blue carbon refers to the carbon taken from atmospheric CO2; fixed by advanced plants (including salt marsh, mangrove, and seagrass), phytoplankton, macroalgae, and marine calcifiers via the interaction of plants and microbes; and stored in nearshore sediments and soils; as well as the carbon transported from the coast to the ocean and ocean floor. The carbon sequestration capacity per unit area of coastal blue carbon is far greater than that of the terrestrial carbon pool. The mechanisms and controls of the carbon sink from salt marshes, mangroves, seagrasses, the aquaculture of shellfish and macroalgae, and the microbial carbon pump need to be further studied. The methods to quantify coastal blue carbon include carbon flux measurements, carbon pool measurements, manipulative experiments, and modeling. Restoring, conserving, and enhancing blue carbon will increase carbon sinks and produce carbon credits, which could be traded on the carbon market. The need to tackle climate change and implement China's commitment to cut carbon emissions requires us to improve studies on coastal blue carbon science and policy. The knowledge learned from coastal blue carbon improves the conservation and restoration of salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrasses; enhances the function of the microbial carbon pump; and promotes sustainable aquaculture, such as ocean ranching.

TI  - Valuation of kelp forest ecosystem services in the falkland islands: A case study integrating blue carbon sequestration potential
AB  - Kelp forests provide many important ecosystem services to people, including mitigating storm damage, cycling nutrients, and providing commercially-harvestable resources. However, kelp forestsâ€™ ability to sequester carbon dioxide, and therefore help regulate the climate, has until recently, been overlooked in assessments of the beneficial services they provide. In this study we incorporate updated knowledge on the potential of kelp to sequester â€˜blue carbonâ€™, and use the extensive kelp forests of the Falkland Islands as a case study to assess the value of kelp forest to society through multiple associated ecosystem services. Our analysis shows kelp forests provide a highly valuable range of direct and indirect services, which if managed correctly, will continue to benefit people, both now and in the future. The total estimated value of the Falkland Islandsâ€™ kelp system is-2-1 currently equivalent to ~ Â£2.69 billion per year (or Â£3.24 million km year ). However, the true value of the kelp forest surrounding the Falkland Islands is likely to be higher still, given that our estimate does not account for elements such as associated scientific research, tourism, and cultural services, due to the necessary data currently being unavailable. Similarly, the full value of these highly biodiverse ecosystems in supplying habitat and food to a large range of associated species is crucial, yet extremely difficult to fully quantify. This study illustrates the importance of maintaining kelp ecosystems in a healthy state to ensure they continue to supply valuable ecological processes, functional roles, and ecosystem services, including their overlooked role as significant long-term carbon sinks.

TI  - Assessment of Carbon Sequestration Capacity of Seaweed in Climate Change Mitigation
AB  - Carbon (C) cycling is being influenced by global climate change, which is altering the primary productivity and the rate at which carbon is fixed, released and stored in vegetation systems on Earth. Carbon sequestration is recognised as the storing of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other kinds of carbon for a long time. A selective atmospheric carbon-based anthropic enrichment causes an environmental catastrophe, which necessitates methods of mitigation. Algal primary production (which includes cyanobacterial algae, microalgal, and macroalgal) is a key pathway for C biosequestration in the ocean. Many scientists and environmental professionals are concerned about the rise in global temperatures and climate change. Increased quantity of carbon that can be absorbed from the atmosphere by exploiting the ability of plants, particularly seaweed, to use CO2 in process of photosynthesis is one of the key solutions being given to prevent the earth's rising temperature at a faster rate. The ability of ocean plants to act as a carbon sink from anthropogenic sources (also recognised as ``Blue Carbon{''}) has piqued people's interest. Marine primary producers are responsible for at least half of the earth's carbon uptake and up to 71 percent of all C storing. Seaweeds have important roles in the elemental cycles of coastal ecosystems, mostly through the export of organic matter to neighbouring communities and the accumulation of carbon and nutrients in the sediment.

TI  - Meeting protein and energy needs for 10 billion people while restoring oceans
AB  - Shellfish and seaweed farming provide resources, opportunities, and solutions to address a wide range of seemingly intractable global problems. Installed and managed properly, aquaculture operations can be restorative to ocean environments, counter climate change, and relieve pressure to farm sensitive terrestrial environments. For these reasons, there is growing social acceptance and political pressure for marine aquaculture expansion, and State, Federal, and International, as well as eNGO-led initiatives are underway. Now is the time to invest in multi-disciplinary science-based teams that can signpost the sustainable pathway for marine aquaculture by developing monitoring and modeling tools and protocols for measuring associated ecosystem impacts and beneficial services. The yield on that investment will be healthy food and more carbon-neutral bio-fuels grown in ways that help heal our oceans. A sustained commitment by the United States now to develop the science and technology for future ocean farms will find an enthusiastic audience in young researchers and technologist around the world, who seek better ways to improve peopleâ€™s lives through their science and problem solving.
