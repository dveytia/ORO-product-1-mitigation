TI  - Interest of storage based STATCOM systems to the power quality enhancement of thyristors based LCC HVDC links for offshore wind farm
AB  - This paper defines a three level 48 pulse STATCOM based on GTO-VSC which is used to support the integration of remote large offshore wind farms into the main onshore grid using line-commutated high-voltage DC connection (LCC-HVDC). This mature transmission technology requires a large quantity of reactive power. In order to enhance the dynamic performance of the LCC-HVDC connected to a weak system, this work presents STATCOM applications to improve the power quality and to avoid commutation failures. Simulation results show that HVDC LCC technology connected to a weak system needs extra reactive power compensation. It confirms the STATCOM performance and its dynamic and fast reactive power compensation during voltage fault conditions. Finally, the sizing of the STATCOM DC capacitor is studied. Â© 2018 IEEE.

TI  - Microbial control of the carbon cycle in the ocean
AB  - The oceans cover 71% of the area of our planet and serve as a major repository for anthropogenic CO2.The amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the ocean is comparable to the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. If all this DOC were to be respired, it would double the CO2 level in the atmosphere and result in catastrophic consequences. Over the past few decades, scientists have increasingly begun to understand the vital role that microbes play in the cycling of carbon in the ocean. Concepts such as theMicrobial Loop (ML) and the Microbial Carbon Pump (MCP) have been proposed to describe the mechanisms by which microbes contribute to carbon flux and storage in the ocean, and the impact that this has on climate change. Recently, National Science Review held a forum focusing on microbially-mediated carbon cycling in the ocean and gathered renowned scientists to discuss the key questions and challenges in this field. Professor Nianzhi Jiao of Xiamen University hosted the panel discussion. Â© The Author(s) 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.

TI  - Modeling the contribution of the microbial carbon pump to carbon sequestration in the South China Sea
AB  - The two key mechanisms for biologically driven carbon sequestration in oceans are the biological pump (BP) and the microbial carbon pump (MCP); the latter is scarcely simulated and quantified in the China seas. In this study, we developed a coupled physical-ecosystem model with major MCP processes in the South China Sea (SCS). The model estimated a SCS-averaged MCP rate of 1.55 mg C m(-2) d(-1), with an MCP-to-BP ratio of 1:6.08 when considering the BP at a depth of 1000 m. Moreover, the ecosystem responses were projected in two representative global warming scenarios where the sea surface temperature increased by 2 and 4 degrees C. The projection suggested a declined productivity associated with the increased near-surface stratification and decreased nutrient supply, which leads to a reduction in diatom biomass and consequently the suppression of the BP. However, the relative ratio of picophytoplankton increased, inducing a higher microbial activity and a nonlinear response of MCP to the increase in temperature. On average, the ratio of MCP-to-BP at a 1000-m depth increased to 1:5.95 with surface warming of 4 degrees C, indicating the higher impact of MCP in future ocean carbon sequestration.

TI  - Fatigue Life Evaluation of Tripod Offshore Structure Using 3D Fatigue FE Analysis
AB  - Offshore wind power became an important source of renewable energy that is rapidly growing over the past several years. Large offshore wind turbines require strong and large support structures. The support substructures are exposed to diverse dynamic and static loads such as waves, snow, wind ice, earthquakes, and tides. These unstable, destructive repeated loads lead to material degradation or damage accumulation which in turn leads to the failure of offshore structures. Fatigue is considered one of the significant modes of failure in offshore structures. The constant exposure of welded multiplanar tubular joints of tripod structure under cyclic loading or the presence of flaws due to fabrication and construction induces high-stress concentration at these joints. The material degradation or damage accumulation at welded joints gives rise to the formation or propagation of cracks, and ultimately leads to a collapse of giant steel structures. This research aimed at investigating the origin of crack positions and fatigue life in tripod offshore structures. The 3-D fatigue FE analysis was carried out in two steps, Firstly, the welding deformation and welding residual stress were calculated in thermal and mechanical analysis. Secondly, 3D fatigue crack analysis based on cyclic hysteresis constitutive equation and fatigue damage theory was used to calculate the fatigue life and crack initiation in tripod offshores structure. Results obtained from the analysis were compared with the results from hot-spot stress method and Eurocode 3. From the results, it was considered that 3D-fatigue FEM is a useful method to estimate fatigue life and crack initiation.

TI  - ISWEC: application of linear tubular generators
AB  - Sea waves are one of the most interesting and well distributed renewable energy sources in the world. At the current state of the art, several devices have been proposed for wave power exploitation and some of them have been commercialized. The ISWEC (Inertial Sea Wave Energy Converter) is a wave energy converter composed of a floating body slack-moored to the seabed using a gyroscope as a reference frame to produce electric power. In this work the gyroscopic wave energy converter is equipped with two linear tubular generators exploiting the reciprocating movement between the gyroscopic system and the hull to generate power.

TI  - Fault ride through strategy for offshore wind farm integration system via MMC-HVDC
AB  - When offshore wind power is transmitted to ac grid through MMC-HVDC, the current and voltage will be quite different from those in traditional ac grid during grid side fault. This paper sets up an offshore wind farm integration system via MMC-HVDC and designs control strategies for each unit in the system. The fault ride through strategy of the system is proposed and its effectiveness has been verified. Thus, the AC bus voltage on wind farm side will stay stable during AC side fault. Once the chopper resistance is set properly, the output power and current of the wind farm can basically remain unchanged, which can successfully achieve fault isolation. The simulation results based on PSCAD have verified the theoretical analysis. Â© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.

TI  - Tidal energy integrated robust frequency control of an islanded AC microgrid with improved-MFO tuned tilt controller
AB  - In recent electrical energy scenario different renewable energy based distribution generation (DG) systems have been developed to provide electrical power to distant and remote consumers. In view of this current research article presents a Tidal Power Plant (TPP) and its integration with an Islanded AC Microgrid system. The tidal energy based TPP is modelled to generate required electrical power. However the inherent dynamic behaviour of TPP largely affects the microgrid system frequency especially in islanded mode of operation. In regard to this to obtain necessary control mechanism in an islanded AC microgrid system, present research article proposes a tilt multistage TDF/(1+TI) controller and to show effectiveness of proposed tilt controller for microgrid control it has been compared with multistage PDF/1+PI and PID controllers. To obtain optimal gain parameters of above implemented controllers an Improved-Moth Flame Optimization (I-MFO) technique has been proposed for this study. To justify viability of proposed I-MFO algorithm its performances have been compared with original MFO algorithm. Finally it has been noticed that to obtain robust frequency control in an islanded AC microgrid system, proposed I-MFO optimized tilt multistage controller exhibits outstanding performance under wind, solar and tidal energy uncertainties.

TI  - A mixed-method optimisation and simulation framework for supporting logistical decisions during offshore wind farm installations
AB  - With a typical investment in excess of 100 million for each project, the installation phase of offshore wind farms (OWFs) is an area where substantial cost-reductions can be achieved; however, to-date there have been relatively few studies exploring this. In this paper, we develop a mixed-method framework which exploits the complementary strengths of two decision-support methods: discrete-event simulation and robust optimisation. The simulation component allows developers to estimate the impact of user defined asset selections on the likely cost and duration of the full or partial completion of the installation process. The optimisation component provides developers with an installation schedule that is robust to changes in operation durations due to weather uncertainties. The combined framework provides a decision-support tool which enhances the individual capability of both models by feedback channels between the two, and provides a mechanism to address current OWF installation projects. The combined framework, verified and validated by external experts, was applied to an installation case study to illustrate the application of the combined approach. An installation schedule was identified which accounted for seasonal uncertainties and optimised the ordering of activities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Failure detection monitoring system qualification through full-scale dynamic testing
AB  - Flexible riser systems are widely adopted by the industry as solutions to interconnect subsea equipment and pipelines to floating production units. Their unique ability to withstand motion and their ease of installation make flexible riser systems a favorable solution when compared to conventional rigid riser systems. Historically, the integrity of flexible risers has been an issue and it is therefore critical that risers are designed and qualified according to the current continually challenging operating conditions. Flexible riser integrity management and complex riser qualification processes have consequently become the main focus for major operators in guaranteeing the safety of offshore operations to reduce the risk of human, environmental and material losses. The industry has requested several qualification tests to verify the manufacture of the new flexible risers, e.g. a dynamic fatigue test, which is required to qualify the flexible pipe for deepwater installation. A means of monitoring the flexible riser response is also required in order to record the integrity of the riser and assist operators in identifying and implementing suitable remedial action, ranging from inspection plans through to riser replacement, as necessary. Based on these requirements, Pulse Structural Monitoring developed an armour wire failure monitoring system and, after extensive testing including offshore tests, validated the system through a full-scale dynamic test cycled to damage 1.0 (safety factor 10), performed by Wellstream. This test continued for more than one year and validated the monitoring system that was able to detect 100% of the wire breaks. This paper presents the results and conclusions from the blind test conducted to qualify the monitoring system. The results demonstrate that the monitoring system was able to detect the wire breaks caused during the full-scale dynamic test and would be a suitable solution to employ on flexible risers to detect failures in the field.

TI  - Optimal Turbine Allocation for Offshore and Onshore Wind Farms
AB  - Green energy became a topic of great interest in the recent years, as every year the demand for energy is increasing and the old resources, fossil fuels in particular, are pollutant and are becoming scarce. As a result, many countries have ambitious plans regarding green energy production. In particular, lots of money and energy are spent on the optimal design of wind farms, as an efficient use of the available resources is instrumental for their economical success. In the present paper we address the optimization of turbine positions, which is one of the most relevant problems in the design of a wind farm, and propose a heuristic approach based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming techniques. Computational results on very large scale instances prove the practical viability of the approach.

TI  - Wind power project size and component costs: An Alaska case study
AB  - Many communities in Alaska, especially along the coast, have excellent wind resources and serve as ideal laboratories for microgrids around the Arctic and the world. Wind power systems have been installed in a number of locations in Alaska, both in remote areas and along the road system. As more isolated microgrids are developed worldwide, understanding the cost and performance of wind power in these systems is of increased importance. In this review of wind power project sizes and costs in Alaska, the costs per kilowatt for the different components of wind turbine installations generally were found to decrease with increasing sizes. Capacity factors ranged from approximately 10% to 40%, with variability from rated wind speeds, wind turbine heights, and the resolution of the wind power class map. Due to the size of communities in Alaska as well as other factors, turbines installed in Alaska are smaller than the trend in the larger market. Evidence indicates that installing overcapacity wind farms, together with energy storage and significant diversion into thermal loads, would allow communities to achieve diesel-off and least-cost energy when considering displacement of diesel fuel for both electricity and heat. However, the size of wind turbines that can be installed in Alaska is limited by the small size of the state's communities and the challenges of integrating high penetrations of wind power into microgrids. Demonstrations of different high-penetration wind power integration techniques are still needed. Â© 2017 Author(s).

TI  - A modified Wells turbine for wave energy conversion
AB  - The method of wave energy conversion utilises an oscillating water column (OWC). The OWC converts wave energy into low-pressure pneumatic energy in the form of bi-directional airflow. Wells turbine with its zero blade pitch setting has been used to convert this pneumatic power into uni-directional mechanical shaft power. Measurements in OWC based wave energy plants in India and Japan show that the airflow velocity is not equal in both directions. The velocity is more when the airflows out to the atmosphere (exhalation) than in the reverse direction. It may be advantageous to set the rotor blade pitch asymmetrically at a positive pitch so as to achieve a higher mean efficiency in a wave cycle. Towards this objective, performance characteristics of a turbine with different blade setting angles in steady flow were found by experimentation. Quasi-steady analysis was then used to predict the mean efficiency for a certain variation of air velocity with time. This variation with time was taken as pseudo-sinusoidal wherein the positive part of the cycle was taken as a half sine-wave whose amplitude is greater than that of the negative half sine-wave. Such a variation is representative of what happens in reality. For exhalation velocity amplitude to inhalation velocity ratios 0.8 and 0.6, a rotor blade setting angle of 2Â° was found to be optimum.

TI  - Understanding how nutrient limitation and plant traits influence carbon in mangrove-seagrass coastal ecosystems
AB  - Mangrove forests and seagrass meadows provide critical ecosystem services, including the accumulation of ``blue carbon.{''} Plants' functional traits could influence this blue carbon accumulation. To test for interactions among functional traits and blue carbon accumulation, we conducted a study in connected mangrove-seagrass coastal ecosystems in southeast Florida (USA). We quantified how plants' above-ground traits correlated with sediment nutrient content, and how changes in traits along inland-to-coastal gradients influenced inorganic and organic carbon storage potential. Physical traits of Thalassia testudinum were higher at sites with higher sediment phosphorus (SP) and nitrogen (SN) concentrations. Sediment organic carbon concentrations were positively correlated to T. testudinum physical traits. Root density, pneumatophore abundance, specific leaf area, leaf toughness, leaf nitrogen, and phosphorus content were positively correlated with SN concentrations in the mangrove forest coastal fringe. Mangrove leaf thickness and root complexity index were negatively correlated with SP concentrations in the coastal fringe. Our results also indicate that seagrass above-ground traits and blue carbon were strongly correlated in areas with higher sediment nutrient concentrations. Moreover, mangrove root complexity is coupled with phosphorus limitation, whereby highly complex root systems develop with decreasing phosphorus concentrations. Distinct functional traits of plants drive variation in carbon retention capacity even in interconnected ecosystems.

TI  - Research on Thrust Distribution Control Strategy of Ship Electric Propulsion System Based on Model Predictive Control
AB  - The Internet of Vessels (IoV) is an extension of the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) to the shipping industry. One of the ultimate goals of ship networking is to realize the intellectualization of ships on the basis of the development of computer and intelligent control technology. The control field of intelligent ships is a hotspot of current research. Power propulsion systems, whether they are propellers or other high-power loads, tend to change dramatically in power consumption when operating in a naturally unpredictable marine environment. A thrust allocation strategy based on model predictive control (MPC) for dynamic power consumption is proposed in this paper. The power consumption is adjusted by coordinating the thrusters so as to offset the fluctuation of the entire power grid caused by the load changes of other electrical equipment of the ship. On the premise of reducing the load change, the overall power consumption of the system is not increased, and the ship speed and position deviation are effectively controlled. Finally, the experiments are carried out on a semi-physical simulation platform to verify the effectiveness of the thrust allocation algorithm.

AB  - Worldwide concern about air quality and global warming has led to emission regulations for the shipping industry and Emission Control Areas (ECAs) including the areas around ports. An appealing alternative to reduce the level of pollution from ships when docked in ports is connecting to shore-side electrical power, known as Cold Ironing. Cold Ironing has the potential to make use of zero emissions electrical generation technology from renewable sources to supply clean electrical power to docked ships. Furthermore, the ports can be considered key customers from the National Grid point of view. Â© 2014 IEEE.

TI  - Flat-sheet membrane for power generation and desalination based on salinity gradient
AB  - The development of renewable and sustainable energy sources has been acknowledged as the most straightforward strategy for global energy security to deal with growing environmental concerns. Out of the available renewable resources, oceans represent a huge untapped potential candidate to provide clean energy while addressing water shortage issue. The utilization of salinity gradients between salt- and freshwater or two salt solutions with different concentrations is a relatively new concept simultaneously to generate electricity and desaline seawater. Salinity gradient energy (SGE) is a zero-emission and sustainable technology that can be practically applied worldwide. When the two mediums are mixed, the SGE can be generated based on the Gibbs free energy. Additionally, SGE can also be harvested from industrial processes where more concentrated salt solutions are produced. In fact, the location where many industries such as sewage treatment plants have discharged substantial amount of fresh- or saline water into the ocean can be a candidate to implement a salinity gradient system to capture the energy. Pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) and reverse electrodialysis (RED) are the two most commonly known SGE methods that are based on membrane technology. Norway and the Netherlands have been especially active in the research and development of osmotic power based on PRO and RED, respectively. Both technologies are dependent on the semipermeable and ion-specific membrane that is selective in its permeability. The performance of both PRO and RED are strongly dependent on the salinity, volume, and cleanliness of the feed water supply. In general, the higher the salinity gradient between the two mixing mediums, the greater the energy that can be harvested in the system. The quality of feed water is also influential on the performance of the membranes as it is known that membranes are generally prone to various forms of foulants present in the water sources. This phenomenon is deemed to be detrimental to the membrane performance and causes a severe reduction in the power output. In terms of application, PRO is known to be more feasible for power generation using concentrated saline brines while RED is more promising to be applied at the locations when seawater and river water meet. From a technical point of view, RED seems to be more attractive experimentally due to its relatively simple set up that does not require high-pressure setups, pressure exchangers, and turbines. It has been commonly agreed that the membrane is one of the most important components to determine the performance of PRO. Hence the membrane characteristics have been carefully tailored to meet the desired requirement to optimize the osmotic power. Meanwhile for the development of RED, the optimization of the ion-exchange membranes (IEMs) is also crucial to ensure reliable performance. Additionally, system characteristics such as internal resistance are also the keys of practical RED performance. Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Analysis of experimental data: The average shape of extreme wave forces on monopile foundations and the NewForce model
AB  - Experiments with a stiff pile subjected to extreme wave forces typical of offshore wind farm storm conditions are considered. The exceedance probability curves of the nondimensional force peaks and crest heights are analysed. The average force time history normalised with their peak values are compared across the sea states. It is found that the force shapes show a clear similarity when grouped after the values of the normalised peak force, F/(ÏghR2), normalised depth h/(gT2p) and presented in a normalised time scale t/Ta. For the largest force events, slamming can be seen as a distinct 'hat' on top of the smoother underlying force curve. The force shapes are numerically reproduced using a design force model, NewForce, which is introduced here for the first time to both first and second order in wave steepness. For force shapes which are not asymmetric, the NewForce model compares well to the average shapes. For more nonlinear wave shapes, higher order terms has to be considered in order for the NewForce model to be able to predict the expected shapes. Â© 2017 The Author(s).

TI  - Numerical implementation and sensitivity analysis of a wave energy converter in a time-dependent mild-slope equation model
AB  - Several Wave Energy Converters (abbreviated as WECs) have intensively been studied and developed during the last decade and currently small farms of WECs are getting installed. WECs in a farm are partly absorbing, partly redistributing the incident wave power. Consequently, the power absorption of each individual WEC in a farm is affected by its neighbouring WECs. The knowledge of the wave climate around the WEC is needed to predict its performance in the farm. In this paper a technique is developed to implement a single and multiple WECs based on the overtopping principle in a time-dependent mild-slope equation model. So far, the mild-slope equations have been widely used to study wave transformations around coastal and offshore structures, such as breakwaters, piles of windmills and offshore platforms. First the limitations of the WEC implementation are discussed through a sensitivity analysis. Next the developed approach is applied to study the wave height reduction behind a single WEC and a farm. The wake behind an isolated WEC is investigated for uni- and multidirectional waves; it is observed that an increase of the directional spread leads to a faster wave redistribution behind the WEC. Further the wake in the lee of multiple WECs is calculated for two different farm lay-outs, i.e. an aligned grid and a staggered grid, by adapting the performance of each WEC to its incident wave power. The evolved technique is a fast tool to find the optimal lay-out of WECs in a farm and to study the possible influence on surrounding activities in the sea. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Can cities become self-reliant in energy? A technological scenario analysis for Cleveland, Ohio
AB  - This study applied the concept of local self-reliance in energy for a North American city, Cleveland, Ohio. Results revealed that while nearly all of Cleveland's energy is imported, there is potential to meet the demand entirely using local, renewable sources of energy. Four scenarios were constructed. The first scenario included planned renewable energy developments: the 20. MW Municipal Solid Waste to Energy (MSWE) facility by Cleveland Public Power and a 20. MW offshore wind project by the Lake Erie Energy Development Corporation (LEEDCo). These resulted in 1% energy self-reliance for the city. The second scenario, in which the contribution of offshore wind power was increased to 1000. MW (LEEDCo's target for 2020), solar power was provided using 10% efficient solar panels on one-quarter of all rooftop area and biodiesel was produced on one-half of the city's vacant land using algae of moderate productivity, produced 17.6% self-reliance. In Scenario 3, the level of energy self-reliance jumped to 70% when LEEDCo's 2030 target of 5000. MW was considered together with solar panels of 20% efficiency and high-productivity algae. In Scenario 4, 100% self-reliance was attained by further increasing offshore wind power. The analysis also revealed that enhanced energy self-reliance could result in $28.7. M to $1.76. bn being retained in Cleveland annually. Although consumer behavior, market forces, and political dynamics can shape the production and use of energy, it is concluded that cities have the potential to substantially increase their energy self-reliance, which may bolster their economic resilience and reduce their ecological footprint.

TI  - Combined Oscillating Water Column \& hydrogen electrolysis for wave energy extraction and management. A case study: The Port of Motril (Spain)
AB  - This paper presents a theoretical novel approach to a marine infrastructure, which jointly uses an OWC (Oscillating Water Column) and hydrogen electrolysis as a clean source of primary conversion for energy management, capable to satisfy a continuous designed demand. A case study in the Port of Motril (Southern Spain) is proposed in order to analyze the performance of the power plant. The assessment covers the sale and management profits from the harvested energy from waves in the electricity market, and from the electrolysis of the oceanic water H2O plus dissolved salts mu into hydrogen H-2, oxygen O-2 and salts mu components, also known as green hydrogen. The investment analysis of the project is conducted through the dynamic financial index Net Present Value (NPV), using Monte Carlo techniques to determine the repayment period. The results are consistent, showing that the plant could supply the annual electricity demand of 356 people with a short repayment period. The amount of energy depends on peak periods Tp and wave heights Hs, which means that other locations could be found so as to improve the performance of the plant in terms of productions of energy and demand supply.

TI  - A Spatiotemporal Methodology for Deep Offshore Resource Assessment
AB  - Reliable wind measurement campaigns needed to address deep offshore wind energy deployment are constrained by their prohibitive installation and maintenance costs. Floating LIDAR systems are a viable alternative to bottom fixed met masts, although have survivability problems during storm seasons. This chapter presents a methodology, based on already well-established standards, able to reduce the offshore measurement campaigns duration by relating them with reliable and low-cost coastal measurements. A two-step calibration procedure, spatiotemporal, is presented to obtain an accurate characterization of the wind resource in deep offshore regions taking into account the time shift between the two measurement points associated with the different atmospheric phenomena propagation. The methodology is applied in two experimental case studies: The first one deals with measurements taken by a LIDAR installed on an islet (10 km away from the coast), while in the second case study a LIDAR system is mounted on a buoy in a deep offshore region. Results show that the added temporal calibration step is gradually more important as the distance between the measurements points increases. Precision enhancements on the order of 4-5 % were observed in the expected annual energy production for a given offshore site. The proposed calibration procedures presented can be applied in many phases of the offshore development: Resource assessment, power performance evaluation and even for completion of missing data in a measurement campaign.

TI  - Deployment and Maintenance of Wave Energy Converters at the Lysekil Research Site: A Comparative Study on the Use of Divers and Remotely-Operated Vehicles
AB  - Ocean renewable technologies have been rapidly developing over the past years. However, current high installation, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning costs are hindering these offshore technologies to reach a commercialization stage. In this paper we focus on the use of divers and remotely-operated vehicles during the installation and monitoring phase of wave energy converters. Methods and results are based on the wave energy converter system developed by Uppsala University, and our experience in offshore deployments obtained during the past eleven years. The complexity of underwater operations, carried out by either divers or remotely-operated vehicles, is emphasized. Three methods for the deployment of wave energy converters are economically and technically analyzed and compared: one using divers alone, a fully-automated approach using remotely-operated vehicles, and an intermediate approach, involving both divers and underwater vehicles. The monitoring of wave energy converters by robots is also studied, both in terms of costs and technical challenges. The results show that choosing an autonomous deployment method is more advantageous than a diver-assisted method in terms of operational time, but that numerous factors prevent the wide application of robotized operations. Technical solutions are presented to enable the use of remotely-operated vehicles instead of divers in ocean renewable technology operations. Economically, it is more efficient to use divers than autonomous vehicles for the deployment of six or fewer wave energy converters. From seven devices, remotely-operated vehicles become advantageous.

TI  - Power Conversion System for Transformer-Less Offshore Wind Turbine
AB  - The power of offshore wind turbines are expected to increase to 10 MW and more in the future. This will make today's technology unsuitable due to increased nacelle weight. Therefore, this work focus on a new modular converter solution, which designed specifically to a generator results in reduced nacelle weight. Additional benefits are redundancy and modularity in the converter.

TI  - Simulation-Based Approach in Selecting a Wave Energy Converter for Sri Lankan Wave Conditions
AB  - With the growing interest in renewable energy, sea waves are considered as an energy source with a high potential for power generation. Sri Lanka being an island surrounded by the sea with about 1300 km long coastal belt, the country holds a theoretical potential of generating a significant amount of power for the national grid from wave energy conversion. Hence this research is focused on the analysis of an improved wave energy convertor which suits Sri Lankan coastal weather conditions. Analysis was conducted based on the wave patterns in the coastal belt to identify the most suitable places to implement wave energy converters. A comparison of existing wave energy conversion technologies and computation simulations were conducted to identify suitable technology for the local wave conditions. The study revealed that the point absorber type wave energy converter was the best solution compatible with wave conditions for the selected coastal region. Buoy geometry of the point absorber was analyzed using computational simulations to select the best geometry. The simulation results showed that the half capsule shape produced the highest force extraction compared to the other shapes.

TI  - Using weather pattern typology to identify calm weather windows for local marine operations
AB  - The cost and complexity of offshore operations, combined with the vulnerability of equipment to prevailing conditions, requires weather-sensitive decisions to be made to ensure the continued accessibility and availability of marine assets. In the current economic context, this is especially important since the robust (timely) identification of calm weather windows has the potential to save many thousands of dollars per day in unplanned downtime and vessel contracting, allowing large efficiencies in sequencing, mobilisation and demobilisation costs if decisions are taken at the earliest possible opportunity. As forecasts extend weeks to months ahead, it is well known that predictability limits make the direct characterisation of small-scale weather events all but impossible, but there still remains a considerable amount of useful information contained within the large-scale weather circulation types. These circulation types, termed 'weather patterns', have a strong influence on the variability of marine wind and wave fields. Here, we present a new method for the tracking of calm weather windows out to several weeks ahead. Using a 34-year hindcast to elicit the daily maximum significant wave height experienced at the location of interest - and an analysis of the associated weather pattern under which they occurred - the circulation types are linked to the viability of offshore operations on a local scale. When subsequently applied in forecast mode, this method can enable earlier decision-making than is typically done at present. As weather patterns are more predictable than the actual weather itself at long lead-times, knowledge of the corresponding historic wave heights can enable identification of expected conditions within a probabilistic weather pattern forecasting system. In addition, the approach facilitates contingency planning; further supporting improved decisionmaking and reduced operational costs for the offshore oil and gas and marine renewable energy sector.

TI  - Environmental Impacts Caused by Tidal Power Extraction in the Upper Bay of Fundy
AB  - Environmental impacts, including tidal regimes and sediment transport in the Minas Basin, caused by tidal power extraction in the Minas Passage have been investigated using a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model in which tidal power extraction is represented using an arbitrary method that adds a friction term to the standard momentum equations. Using the model results, changes in tidal processes and sediment transport in the Minas Basin are examined by comparing model results with and without power extraction. With the presence of power extraction, the tidal level decreases by 0.5-1.5\% and the tidal phase increases by 1.2-1.8 degrees. Tidal currents decrease by 15-35\% at the western head of the Minas Basin and increase by a comparable magnitude at the Southern Bight. The presence of power extraction could move the location of the tidal residual gyre in the western head of the Minas Basin south by about 2 km. Model results also show that less sediment would move into the central area of the Minas Basin but more sediment would be deposited into the Southern Bight at a rate of 8-12 mm y(-1). The effect of the deposition rate might be negligible in the northern part of the Bight where the water is deep but could be important in the intertidal areas.

TI  - Microbial Fuel Cells, A Current Review
AB  - Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are devices that can use bacterial metabolism to produce an electrical current from a wide range organic substrates. Due to the promise of sustainable energy production from organic wastes, research has intensified in this field in the last few years. While holding great promise only a few marine sediment MFCs have been used practically, providing current for low power devices. To further improve MFC technology an understanding of the limitations and microbiology of these systems is required. Some researchers are uncovering that the greatest value of MFC technology may not be the production of electricity but the ability of electrode associated microbes to degrade wastes and toxic chemicals. We conclude that for further development of MFC applications, a greater focus on understanding the microbial processes in MFC systems is required.

TI  - Lateral vibration properties of partially embedded pile groups foundation considering axial forces
AB  - For offshore engineering, dynamic characteristics of supporting system of foundation are extremely important for the stability and security of upper structures. Based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam model, transfer matrix method is used to establish lateral vibration model for the partially embedded single pile considering the coupling effect of lateral load and vertical load. The main influence factors for impedance and effective pile length are analyzed;and the shortages of existing theory are indicated and also amended. The pile-pile interaction is studied from three aspects, i.e. length ratio, wave incidence angle and axial force;and a simplified approach for calculating partially embedded pile groups is put forward on the basis of superposition theory. Furthermore, solutions of the proposed model are compared with theoretical results for fully embedded pile groups. Through the discussion of parameters, it is concluded that the axial force(N), pile spacing(s/d) and length ratio (L1/L2) are very important for the lateral vibration properties of partially embedded pile groups, which cannot be ignored by designers. Finally, the introduced model is used to study the effects of lateral vibration properties of the pile groups for an offshore wind power plant and variation of impedance of the pile groups foundation on natural vibration characteristics of overall structure.

TI  - Making: Waves
AB  - A vast renewable, almost untapped energy resource can be found in the world's ocean. The primary types of ocean energy include wind, wave, tidal and ocean current. Wave appears to be the most promising as a recoverable resource because it contains higher energy potential than other ocean energies. Wave energy varies in different parts of the world, but is particularly abundant off of the European Atlantic coast (especially off Scottland), northern Canada, southern Africa, Australia, and the northeastern and southeastern coasts of the US. According to the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), the total wave energy resource along the US outer continental shelf is 2,640 TWh/yr. Of that figure, 1,170 TWh/yr is recoverable, which represents almost 1/3 of the 4,000 TWh/yr of electricity used in the US each year. By comparison, there was approximately 446 TWh of electric power produced from wind worldwide in 2011, according to the GWEC.

TI  - Process control potentials on gasification and combined cycle integration
AB  - IGCC plants are potentially the most competitive and economical concepts to produce electricity and thermal energy which will significantly reduce emission levels through advanced control methodologies. Considering sustainability issues on natural resource and environment, an IGCC plant is by far the best one with regard to the power generation. However, the technical difficulty prevents its widespread commercial usage. A typical IGCC plant consists of the air separation unit, gasification system, gas cleanup processes, gas and steam turbine combined cycle. Modeling and control of multiple ICCC components and technology integration play a leading role. In this article, some practical control approaches for individual components of the ICCC plants are explored, such as air blown control and oxygen blown control under conditions of startup, loading, steady slate, unloading and shutdown operations throughout the compressor trip, gasificr trip, gas turbine trip and steam turbine trip. In addition, coordinate control and system integration in terms of IGCC performance and environmental objectives will also be investigated.

TI  - FLNG design issues - Building on known technology
AB  - Floating LNG production units are being proposed for a number of applications worldwide. The majority of those being proposed are based on use of a ship-shaped hull and intend to use some technology similar to that used in the LNG shipping industry. This paper will address how far the experience and technology used in shipping applications can be utilised directly in an offshore LNG project and how the gaps are being tackled today. DNV has been involved in many of the ongoing projects looking at technical feasibility and more detailed design of a number of FLNG concepts and has also carried out studies to address some of the key technological gaps identified between existing experience and proposed applications. These issues include limitations on use of traditional LNG containment systems, particularly of the membrane type, considerations of impact of FLNG operational modes on some design details traditional to the shipping industry, some consequences on layout and arrangement to take account of topside hazards, and some consequences of selection of the various liquefaction technologies available.

TI  - Structural condition monitoring for offshore wind turbines making sense of data via structural analysis
AB  - Offshore wind farms are expensive and valuable assets. The latest developments require sums in the order of Â£1 billion to construct and commission. Operators need to generate electricity that can be sold to repay the initial investment and ongoing operating costs. The failure or compromised operation of these assets can have serious financial consequences, and even a small reduction in downtime or an extension to expected lifetime can have a rapid payback due to the high initial capital expenditure. One way to reduce lost time is to add intelligence to asset management by using condition monitoring. Extracting real value from condition monitoring equipment requires a systems-level approach to give meaning to the measurements. A collaboration between UK-based companies Proeon Systems and Aquaterra Energy provides this systems-level approach by combining expertise in both advanced control and monitoring with structural mechanics and analysis.

TI  - A Novel Mooring Tether for Highly-Dynamic Offshore Applications; Mitigating Peak and Fatigue Loads via Selectable Axial Stiffness
AB  - Highly-dynamic floating bodies such as wave energy convertors require mooring lines with particular mechanical properties; the mooring system must achieve adequate station keeping whilst controlling mooring tensions within acceptable limits. Optimised compliant mooring systems can meet these requirements but where compliance is achieved through system architecture, the complexity of the system increases together with the mooring footprint. This work introduces the ``Exeter Tether{''}, a novel fibre rope mooring tether providing advantages over conventional fibre ropes. The tether concept aims to provide a significantly lower axial stiffness by de-coupling this attribute from the minimum breaking load of the line. A benefit of reduced axial stiffness is the reduction of mooring system stiffness providing a reduction of peak and fatigue loads, without increasing mooring system complexity. Reducing these loads improves system reliability and allows a reduction in mass of both the mooring system and the floating body, thus reducing costs. The principles behind the novel tether design are presented here, along with an outline of eight prototype tether variants. Results from the proof of concept study are given together with preliminary findings from sea trials conducted in Falmouth Bay. Results demonstrate that the Exeter Tether can be configured to achieve a significantly lower axial stiffness than conventional fibre rope and that the stiffness is selectable within limits for a given breaking strength. Strain values greater than 0.35 are achieved at 30\% of line breaking strength; this represents more than a threefold increase of the strain achievable with a conventional rope of the same material. The tether was subjected to six months of sea trials to establish any threats to its own reliability and to inform future design enhancements in this respect.

TI  - AUV-based characterization of EMF emissions from submerged power cables
AB  - AUV-based field measurement and characterization of the electromagnetic field in coastal waters associated with live submerged cables is described. The effort is in support of a program to characterize the EMF emissions associated with submerged power transmission cables from offshore energy harvesting devices to shore and identifying their environmental impact on marine animals. The electric field is measured using a custom 3-axes sensor mounted on a Bluefin 21 AUV and the magnetic field is measured using a Marine Magnetics SeaSPY magnetometer towed from the vehicle so that it is isolated from the AUV machinery. The AUV is equipped with onboard upward (600kHz) and downward (300kHz) looking ADCPs, and a CTD package which simultaneously provide the contextual in-situ oceanographic information, including temperature, salinity, and current velocity in the water column. The electric-field sensor development, its implementation on the AUV, and illustrative at-sea surveys, involving deployment of the EM sensors in shallow waters over a submerged cable with the power in the cable turned off/on, are described.

TI  - Introducing system flexibility to a multinational transmission expansion planning model
AB  - Grid investments are considered as sunk costs with a very long lifetime, particularly in an offshore grid context. The market mechanisms for cost recovery of these investments are exposed to an increasing share of variable power generation at the supply side, demanding more flexibility in the system. Hence, it is of great interest to account for these changes in tools being used for decision support. This paper presents an extension of an already existing mixed integer linear program (MILP) for transmission expansion planning (TEP), by including system flexibility in the form of energy storage and demand-side management. Moreover, an enhanced description of variable power generation is used to construct production profiles with a higher level of detail. The latter is achieved by simulating weather data for wind and solar incorporating higher temporal and spatial resolution than in previous studies. The impact of using new times series for variable power generation, and the introduction of system flexibility, are both presented separately using the North Sea area for a comparative case study with 2030 scenarios provided by ENTSO-E. The consequent results of interest include lifetime operational costs (OPEX), investment costs (CAPEX), and offshore wind power curtailment. Â© 2016 Power Systems Computation Conference.

TI  - A preliminary work on blue carbon stock mapping in mangrove habitat using satellite-based approach
AB  - Mangrove habitat is among blue carbon components that offer a strong base for mitigation strategies in coastal ecosystems. It provides numerous significant economic and ecological services such as being capable of serving as a long-term carbon sink via sequestering carbon from the atmosphere by photosynthesis as well as carbon burial within the sediment. Therefore, it is essential to comprehend the distribution of carbon dioxide stored in mangrove habitat in spatiotemporal bases. This article seeks to map mangrove blue carbon stock in coastal water of Penang, Malaysia using a moderate spatial resolution of passive remote sensing data. In this study, an established allometric equation for tree and root was implemented on Landsat ETM for mangrove area to estimate below-ground carbon and above-ground carbon stocks by measuring biomass using Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) parameter. Afterwards, the biomass of every single stand was multiply by 0.464 gC to obtain the contents of carbon. DBH-radiance relationship models were generated using polynomial regression equation and employed to predict the entire above-ground and below-ground biomass of mangrove in the study area by plotting DBH value against radiance value. For accuracy, acceptable R2 Adjusted values of 0.415, 0.438, 0.593 and p = values of 0.0503, 0.0440, and 0.0154 were obtained for blue, green and red bands, respectively. The study revealed the capabilities of satellite-based approach in estimating mangrove blue carbon stock, whose conservation and storage are paramount as outlined in the 2030 agenda of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

TI  - Systematic investigation of integrating small wind turbines into power supply for hydrocarbon production
AB  - In this paper, the technical and economic feasibility of integrating SWTs (Small Wind Turbines) into remote oil production sites are investigated. Compared to large turbines in onshore and offshore wind farms, SWTs are more suitable for individual power generations. A comprehensive approach based on wind energy assessment, wind power prediction, and economic analysis is then recommended, to evaluate how, where, and when small wind production recovery is achievable in oilfields. Firstly, wind resource in oilfields is critically assessed based on recorded meteorological data. Then, the wind power potential is numerically tested using specified wind turbines with density-corrected power curves. Later, estimations of annual costs and energy-saving are carried out before and after the installation of SWT via the LCOE (Levelized Cost of Electricity) and the EROI (Energy Return on Investment). The proposed methodology was tested against the Daqing oilfield, which is the largest onshore oilfield in China. The results suggested that over 80% of the original annual costs in oil production could be saved through the integrations between wind energy and oil production. Â© 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Investigation on corrosion characteristics of pipeline in co2 ocean storage system
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is an important measure to reduce CO2 emissions. Using the ocean as a sequestration site for CO2 can permanently store a large amount of CO2, which has a bright future. Liquid CO2 transportation and complex marine environments are the main features of ocean storage systems. The high salt marine environment and impurities in liquid CO2 can cause severe internal and external corrosion to CO2 pipelines and other facilities. This paper introduced the principle and storage method of CO2 ocean storage, analyzed the main factors affecting the internal and external corrosion of CO2 transportation pipeline in ocean storage system, and listed several possible anticorrosion measures. Finally, the research related to the corrosion issues of CO2 ocean storage system was prospected. Â© 2019, Chinese Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

TI  - WindStore - Large-scale energy storage offshore
AB  - WindStore is a research project focussed on Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) in the UK and Ireland, both onshore and offshore. CAES uses low-cost electricity at off-peak times or from renewable projects to compress air into a subsurface void or reservoir for storage. At peak times or when required, the compressed air and additional fuel drive a turbine to generate electricity. The two existing CAES projects in Germany and the USA are located onshore and use solution-mined salt cavities as storage reservoirs. Offshore the storage options include voids such as steel vessels and salt structures, and porous media such as saline aquifers and depleted gas reservoirs. There are two major applications for CAES offshore. (1) Small projects of some 10 MW capacity could be operated on platforms to store the variable output from nearby wind, wave or tidal current generators and make offshore installations more energy-independent. The fuel usage of CAES is significantly reduced compared to single cycle gas turbines. (2) Large offshore wind farms are planned, for instance, in the southern North Sea where depleted gas reservoirs exist. A large-scale CAES plant of several hundred megawatt capacity could be built on a disused platform using the depleted reservoir for air storage. This paper describes the applications and likely economics of small and large CAES plants located offshore with focus on the North Sea. It is outlined how CAES can allow a more economic use of high-voltage DC transmission links in future offshore networks. Copyright 2007, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - Environmental protection in the beatrice field development
AB  - The development of the Beatrice field in the Inner Moray Firth area of the UK North Sea has presented particular problems in the area of environmental protection. Because the field lies only 12 miles from a totally unspoiled coastline of very great scenic beauty and environmental quality, it was necessary, before field development approval could be obtained, to convince central government, local authorities and various nature preservation bodies that an environmental protection plan could be developed. The plan, which covered the offshore field, pipeline and onshore terminal, consisted essentially of three main elements. Firstly, an environmental impact analysis was commissioned, to be carried out by an independent specialist consultant, which was subsequently progressed into a long term monitoring programme. Secondly, a plan was drawn up to deal with the prevention and control of spillages, both offshore and onshore. This presented particular problems due to the proximity to the shore and the waxy nature of Beatrice crude which made the use of conventional dispersant methods impracticable, and required the development of innovative techniques. Finally, a series of technical discussions took place with local and central government authorities, followed by a series of presentations at public meetings. It was thereby possible to not only gain the necessary approval of the authorities, but also to establish the confidence of the local population and the various environmental.and conservation organisations. The Beatrice Pollution Control Plan is the first developed for a near shore oil field in the UK. As such it provides guidelines for dealing with similar developments in future.

TI  - Modelling, control and frequency domain analysis of a tidal current conversion system with onshore converters
AB  - To optimise a tidal energy conversion system, the operation, maintenance and power generation aspects have to be taken into account. As a result the key focus of this study is to propose and investigate an alternative method of implementing a tidal energy conversion system using a pitch-regulated turbine and a variable-speed squirrel cage induction generator with long distance converters. The generator power output can be optimised by utilising variable-speed control strategies allowing the system to operate at maximum power coefficient while availability can be increased by reducing the components installed offshore by using long three-phase cables between the generator and onshore voltage source converters. The tidal current energy conversion system is investigated by developing a full resource-to-grid model in MATLAB/SIMULINK and by performing system analysis regarding the effects of harmonics in the long subsea cables. Simulation results show that optimised filter design and the choice of suitable operating frequency for the generator controller can minimise the overvoltages associated with the harmonics and the reflecting voltage waves in the cables.

TI  - Parametric study of a wave energy converter (Searaser) for Caspian Sea
AB  - Over the past decades, different types of energy converters have been invented because wave energy is a renewable energy source with high potential for extraction of considerable clean energy. Many numerical and experimental tests have been conducted to calculate the power generation of ocean waves, and these tests have demonstrated the significance of this energy. In this paper, the hydrodynamic performance of a new energy converter called ``Searaser{''} has been evaluated using numerical simulation to study different aspects of this energy converter. Since previous studies have found ocean wave energy converters excellent for implementation in the Caspian Sea, the aim of this study is to investigate its performance for that sea, so this study presents a numerical simulation of Searaser inside an experimental wave tank using commercial software Flow-3D. To model the motion of the energy converter, Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes was coupled with a volume-of-fluid (VOF) model to generate three dimensional numerical linear propagating waves for solving the fluid field. Grid independency was also carried out to determine the best mesh numbers for the original simulations. Finally, the Searaser hydrodynamic performance was numerically calculated for different wave heights, and some of the most important parameters of point absorbers were captured, including output flow rate in different seasons, extractable wave power, and output power. Accordingly, the obtained results indicate that the output flow rate and the power generation are significantly increased by incremental changes in wave height, and using this type of converter device has potential for practical and profitable use in industrial applications.

The values of the parameters a, n and the constant k for the models are determined using a plot of curve drying models. Three different drying models are compared with experiment data at average temperature and relative humidity about 50Â°C and 20% respectively. The most suitable model is selected to best describe the drying behavior of seaweed. The values of the coefficient of determination (R 2), mean bias error (MBE) and root mean square error (RMSE) are used to determine the goodness or the quality of the fit. The Page model is showed a better fit to drying seaweed among Newton model and Henderson and Pabis model.

TI  - Enhancing the lateral capacity of monopiles in sand using reinforced concrete footings
AB  - This paper presents the results of three dimensional finite element analyses, which investigated the improvement in the lateral capacity of a large diameter monopile in medium dense to dense sand when used in combination with reinforced concrete footings. Footings, with and without a skirt, were assessed under a combination of vertical, lateral and moment loads expected at an offshore wind farm location with a water depth of 30 m. The influence of surcharge load due to a gravel armour was also examined. Findings indicate favourable interaction between the monopile, footings and the gravel armour resulting in increased lateral capacity of the hybrid systems. The larger lateral capacity is as a result of the restoring force provided by the footings and the subsequent reduction in monopile bending moments. In addition to being technically feasible, the hybrid options were also found to be cost effective. Â© The authors and ICE Publishing: All rights reserved, 2015.

TI  - Response of vertically loaded centrifuge suction caisson models in soft clay
AB  - Tidal current turbines are designed to interact with flowing water. This interaction results in a significant horizontal load and corresponding overturning moment that can be resisted through a compression and tension mechanism on opposing foundation legs if the foundations are configured as a multipod. This study investigates the response of suction caisson foundations in soft clay with an aspect ratio of one to this compression and tension loading by means of centrifuge testing. Suction caisson models with an aspcct ratio of one were fabricated out of T6-6160 aluminum at a scale of 1:90 and tested in kaolin testbeds. The kaolin testbeds were consolidated from slurry under an effective stress matching the effective stress at the mid depth of the testbed when spun at 90-g. A series of monotonic vertical load tests were conducted at 90-g on a beam centrifuge using a vertical stepper motor. The series of load tests comprised of undrained monotonic loading phases conducted both prior and post long period cyclic load phases corresponding to the longer period components of tidal current velocity fluctuations. Geotechnical centrifuge testing allows for the investigation of suction caisson response under loading conditions applicable to tidal current turbine structures under realistic stress and stress distributions by artificially increasing the gravity. The response of the suction caisson under vertical monotonic loading without any prior cycling provided a baseline case for determination of the effects of long period cycling (i.e. semi-diurnal tidal current fluctuations) on future monotonic undrained loading. The load tests showed that the effects of long period cyclic loading on the degradation of the undrained monotonic capacity were dependent on the amplitude of the cyclic loading. The cyclic strain thresholds that caused a significant decrease in the post cyclic monotonic capacity were not the same for compression and uplift loading mechanisms. This indicates that serviceability constraints will play a critical role in tidal current turbine foundation design. Ensuring reliable foundation design will allow for cost efficiency during construction and over the lifetime of the tidal current turbine structure. As tidal current turbine technology, at this time, is primarily in the prototyping stage, it is key to understand the response of the foundations to these loading conditions in order to increase the cost cfficicncy of the overall structure.

TI  - Coal energy conversion with carbon sequestration via combustion in supercritical saline aquifer water
AB  - The standard idea for deep saline aquifer sequestration is to separate carbon dioxide from a process stream, compress it, and inject it underground. However, since carbon dioxide is less dense than water, even at the high pressures found in aquifers, it is buoyant and will move towards the surface unless trapped by an impermeable seal. Also, significant energy expenditure is required to separate and compress carbon dioxide, even though neat carbon dioxide is not a desired product. These issues may be addressed by combining the idea of fast dissolution at the surface with supercritical water oxidation (SCWO). By burning coal at high pressure in supercritical water drawn from an aquifer, and then sequestering the entire pre-equilibrated effluent, all carbon from the fuel is captured, as well as all non-mineral coal combustion products including sulfur and metals. A possible block diagram of an SCWO-based electric power plant is proposed, including processes to handle salts from the aquifer brine and minerals from coal. The plant is thermodynamically modeled, using an indirectly fired combined cycle to convert energy from hot combustion products to work. This model estimates the overall thermal efficiency that can be achieved, and reveals unanticipated interactions within the plant that have significant effects on efficiency. The assumptions and results of the model highlight design challenges for an actual system. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Biodiversity characterisation and hydrodynamic consequences of marine fouling communities on marine renewable energy infrastructure in the Orkney Islands Archipelago, Scotland, UK
AB  - As part of ongoing commitments to produce electricity from renewable energy sources in Scotland, Orkney waters have been targeted for potential large-scale deployment of wave and tidal energy converting devices. Orkney has a well-developed infrastructure supporting the marine energy industry; recently enhanced by the construction of additional piers. A major concern to marine industries is biofouling on submerged structures, including energy converters and measurement instrumentation. In this study, the marine energy infrastructure and instrumentation were surveyed to characterise the biofouling. Fouling communities varied between deployment habitats; key species were identified allowing recommendations for scheduling device maintenance and preventing spread of invasive organisms. A method to measure the impact of biofouling on hydrodynamic response is described and applied to data from a wave-monitoring buoy deployed at a test site in Orkney. The results are discussed in relation to the accuracy of the measurement resources for power generation. Further applications are suggested for future testing in other scenarios, including tidal energy. Â© 2017 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - The Combination of 2D Layered Graphene Oxide and 3D Porous Cellulose Heterogeneous Membranes for Nanofluidic Osmotic Power Generation
AB  - Salinity gradient energy, as a type of blue energy, is a promising sustainable energy source. Its energy conversion efficiency is significantly determined by the selective membranes. Recently, nanofluidic membrane made by two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials (e.g., graphene) with densely packed nanochannels has been considered as a high-efficient membrane in the osmotic power generation research field. Herein, the graphene oxide-cellulose acetate (GO-CA) heterogeneous membrane was assembled by combining a porous CA membrane and a layered GO membrane; the combination of 2D nanochannels and 3D porous structures make it show high surface-charge-governed property and excellent ion transport stability, resulting in an efficient osmotic power harvesting. A power density of about 0.13 W/m(2) is achieved for the sea-river mimicking system and up to 0.55 W/m(2) at a 500-fold salinity gradient. With different functions, the CA and GO membranes served as ion storage layer and ion selection layer, respectively. The GO-CA heterogeneous membrane open a promising avenue for fabrication of porous and layered platform for wide potential applications, such as sustainable power generation, water purification, and seawater desalination.

TI  - Sustainable freshwater from the tropical oceans
AB  - The northeast region of Brazil has gone through severe droughts for many decades, which tend to get worse due to the climate change scenarios in the twenty-first century. The population has been migrating southbound, which has brought about serious social imbalances. For the tropical surface ocean waters being the largest thermal solar collectors and reservoirs in the planet, a solution is proposed for inexhaustible supply of freshwater by combining two renewable energy routes through a hybrid offshore energy farm, ocean thermal energy conversion, and offshore wind power. Preliminary feasibility studies are carried out for such an energy farm to deliver freshwater, and to be deployed along the coastline of the northeast region of Brazil. It is calculated 0.43Â USD/m3 as a minimum levelized cost of freshwater, for which the total investments, excluded the desalination units, the freshwater pipelines and the electrical cables, amount to USD 28Â billion. Other less capital intensive scenarios are shown, with USD 16Â billion investment for 0.57Â USD/m3 levelized cost of freshwater. Â© 2015, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.

TI  - Cost comparison in various CO2 ocean disposal options
AB  - CO2 ocean disposal is one of several ways proposed to mitigate the greenhouse gas effect. In this paper, we estimate the cost of various CO2 disposal options. The system consists of a conventional pulverized coal power plant, CO2 separation using an amine scrubber, liquefaction and transportation. In this investigation, the power plant and the CO2 separation plant are common. The liquefaction process and transportation systems are different. We evaluate the costs of pipeline, liquid CO2 tanker for CO2 lake, liquid CO2 tanker dispersion, dry ice tanker and CO2 dispersion by OTEC. The effect of distance between a power plant and the disposal site, plant size, and plant efficiency on the cost for each case is evaluated. Costs of ocean disposal options are estimated about 90 to 180 per tonne of CO2 avoided. The least cost transportation option is dependent on the distance between power plant and site.

TI  - An inter-comparison of dynamic, fully coupled, electro-mechanical, models of tidal turbines
AB  - Production of electricity using hydrokinetic tidal turbines has many challenges that must be overcome to ensure reliable, economic and practical solutions. Kinetic energy from flowing water is converted to electricity by a system comprising diverse mechanical and electrical components from the rotor blades up to the electricity grid. To date these have often been modelled using simulations of independent systems, lacking bi-directional, real-time, coupling. This approach leads to critical effects being missed. Turbulence in the flow, results in large velocity fluctuations around the blades, causing rapid variation in the shaft torque and generator speed, and consequently in the voltage seen by the power electronics and so compromising the export power quality. Conversely, grid frequency and voltage changes can also cause the generator speed to change, resulting in changes to the shaft speed and torque and consequently changes to the hydrodynamics acting on the blades. Clearly, fully integrated, bi-directional, models are needed. Here we present two fully coupled models which use different approaches to model the hydrodynamics of rotor blades. The first model uses the Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT), resulting in an efficient tool for turbine designers. The second model also uses BEMT, combines this with an actuator line model of the blades coupled to an unsteady computational fluid dynamics simulation by OpenFOAM (CFD/BEMT). Each model is coupled to an OpenModelica model of the electro-mechanical system by an energy balance to compute the shaft speed. Each coupled system simulates the performance of a 1.2 m diameter, three-bladed horizontal axis tidal turbine tested in the University of Edinburgh FloWave Ocean Energy Research Facility. The turbulent flow around the blades and the mechanical-electrical variables during the stable period of operation are analysed. Time series and tabulated average values of thrust, torque, power, and rotational speed, as well as, electrical variables of generator power, electromagnetic torque, voltage and current are presented for the coupled system simulation. The relationship between the mechanical and electrical variables and the results from both tidal turbine approaches are discussed. Our comparison shows that while the BEMT model provides an effective design tool (leading to slightly more conservative designs), the CFD/BEMT simulations show the turbulence influence in the mechanical and electrical variables which can be especially important in assessing an additional source of stresses in the whole electro-mechanical system (though at an increased computational cost).

TI  - Investigation of lightning parameters occurring on offshore wind farms
AB  - The following study conducted on offshore wind farms (WFs) located in the North Sea and in the Baltic Sea. The lightning strokes of 13 WFs over the period of about 8...10 years were analyzed before and after their construction using the lightning location system (LLS) of EUropean Cooperation for Lightning Detection (EUCLID) [1]. Many WFs were excluded from the observation because they were constructed just recently. A detection efficiency (DE) of any LLS for ground-to-cloud flashes (upward lightning) in some cases is very low compared to cloud-to-ground flashes (downward lightning). In [2] the DE of 43% is reported and explained by the fact that the ground-to-cloud lightning currents are often an initial continuous current only (ICConly), free from any superimposed impulse currents and therefore cannot be detected by LLS at all. This type of flashes is often occurred at tall structures (> 100 m) and could pose a risk to wind turbines (WTs) because of their enormous high transferred charge values which can easily exceed 300 As. This specific type of ground-to-cloud flashes are not covered by this study because of the limitation of the LLS. The data obtained during current initial investigation can be used for design and test of lightning protection system (LPS) for WT. The IEC 61400-24 Ed.2.0 (CD) [3] recommends to consider the same maximum values of lightning parameters for offshore WT as for onshore WT, since 'there is no evidence of lightning parameters being significantly different offshore'. Our investigation clearly shows that this is not the case. Also, the distance from the coast has an influence on the lightning parameters. Finally, cumulative probability distributions of lightning current peak values obtained for offshore WFs are compared with corresponding curves for onshore WFs presented in [4]. Â© 2017 IEEE.

TI  - Special P&A with resin and microcement pumped from interception well due to multi-string collapse
AB  - During the production phase of the PW1 well, an unintentional operation depressurized the annulus A below its design limit, resulting in a progressive casing collapse from the surface casing to the tubing. Therefore, it was not possible to abandon the well conventionally. This complex abandonment scenario demanded for a rig to drill an intervention well (IW1) and set up the safety barriers. The IW1 well was successfully drilled, intercepting the production well (PW1) at 3,056-m (TD) through a 1.10-m long slotted window. The whole operation was monitored via PDG from the PW1, making possible to identify the exact moment that the interception occurred and safely displacing the cementing fluids, while avoiding the risk of fracturing exposed formations. Numerical simulations and real time monitoring of the injection pressure demonstrated the success of the operation with excellent adherence between the plan and the execution phases. Due to the restrictions imposed by the characteristics of the PW1 reservoir, production tubing and its accessories, such as, slotted liner, ESP, NRV and DHSV, it was necessary to evaluate plugging materials that could be displaced through those restrictions without reaching the fracture limit of formation at the IW1 casing shoe. Ultrafine cement, pure resin and combinations of both were selected for their ability to pass through restrictions and resist to contamination by fluids present in the well, while also developing compressive strength to provide zonal isolation. Optimized plugging formulations were evaluated by passing them through artificial porous media, which simulated the PW1 well restrictions. After 87 operational days, the PW1 well was successfully abandoned. A 79-m long cement plug was set in the annulus A and inside the tubing. The safety barrier was established and verified with pressure tests according to the regulatory criteria imposed by the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP).

AB  - This paper studies wave influence on two horizontal axis tidal turbines developed by industrial partners: Sabella and Magallanes Renovables. The trials are performed in a wave and current flume tank where upstream flow conditions are monitored thanks to Laser Doppler Velocimetry. Wave amplitude and orbital amplitude are computed thanks to least mean square method. The turbulence is analysed through its intensity and a power spectral density point of view. A special attention is paid to turbine immersion depth. Global torque and thrust are analyzed in the frequency domain thanks to power spectral density and magnitude square coherence. Wave generates a strong torque and thrust fluctuation level of the same order as the mean effort level. Both torque and thrust respond to wave at wave and twice the wave frequency for all turbines whatever the immersion. Â© 2023 the Author(s).

AB  - The majority of product environmental footprints for a product are determined at the design stage of its life cycle, especially in conceptual design. However, it is difficult to achieve the solution evaluation for product environmental footprint with unascertained product information in conceptual design. This paper is devoted to conceptual design evaluation for product environmental footprint using unascertained measure model. After the unascertained measure model based on the Unascertained Mathematical Theory is introduced, the evaluation process of solutions in conceptual design for product environmental footprint based on unascertained measure model is discussed in detail. And the product conceptual design for product environmental footprint integrated with unascertained measure model based evaluation approach is also proposed. The conceptual design of the offshore wind power installation platform is given as an example, which demonstrates that the methodology is helpful to design evaluation in conceptual design for product environmental footprint.

TI  - Novel Control Scheme for Wind Generation with Energy Storage supplying a given Demand Power
AB  - The paper addresses a novel scheme for the control of variable wind energy and energy storage plant such that the generation and energy storage can deliver a smooth and constant power as demanded by the grid load. In addition, the wind energy generators are assumed large compared to the local grid rating and will contribute to the voltage and frequency regulation of a grid using adaptive frequency and voltage droops. The scheme is appropriate for wind turbines or other variable renewable supplies feeding stand-alone grids, micro-grids, local area grids, or feeder busses for offshore wind farms. The paper describes the control philosophy and the communicative strategy between the generators, energy storage, dispatchable load and auxiliary generators or power feeds. Simulation results using the PSCAD program are given that illustrate the smooth, constant and responsive nature of the power delivery. The ratings of the energy storage and dispatchable loads are discussed with supporting results.

TI  - Adiabatic conversion method for the development of marine hydrate deposits
AB  - The main reserves of methane on our planet are in the form of gas hydrate and more than 90% of them are at the bottom of the oceans. Scientists in many countries are making active efforts to establish effective technology for the development of gas hydrate deposits and, primarily located in the sedimentary rocks of the ocean floor. However, the first experience indicates that the development costs of gas hydrate deposits are very high. One of the main reasons for the high cost of recovering methane hydrate is the high value of the decomposition's thermal effect. The heat of methane hydrate decomposition is 410 kJ/kg, that 30% exceeds, even energy intensive process, as the melting water ice. We have proposed and patented the way to develop marine gas hydrate deposits without the cost of thermal energy and using of any environmentally hazardous substances. The method consists in grinding of sediment filled of methane hydrate and its subsequent lifting platform by the pipeline in the form of a suspension in seawater. When lifting the hydrate-contained suspension crosses the line of phase equilibrium and goes out of his stable thermo-dynamic state. Decomposition of gas hydrate phase in this case will be provided at the expense of the sea water crystallization energy. In the pipeline the conversion of gas hydrate slurry in the slurry containing of water, ice particles and gas, released from gas hydrate happen. It should be noted that the methane gas released from the hydrate, creates a lifting force in the pipe, thus avoiding the energy costs for transporting hydrate-contained rock on the surface.

TI  - Prospects of ocean-based renewable energy for West Africaâ€™s sustainable energy future
AB  - Purpose: The limited supply of fossil fuels, constant rise in the demand of energy and the importance of reducing greenhouse emissions have brought the adoption of renewable energy sources for generation of electrical power. One of these sources that has the potential to supply the worldâ€™s energy needs is the ocean. Currently, ocean in West African region is mostly utilized for the extraction of oil and gas from the continental shelf. However, this resource is depleting, and the adaptation of ocean energy could be of major importance. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the possibilities of ocean-based renewable energy (OBRE) and analyze the economic impact of adapting an ocean energy using a thermal gradient (OTEC) approach for energy generation. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is conducted from the perspective of cost, energy security and environmental protection. Findings: This study shows that adapting ocean energy in the West Africa region can significantly produce the energy needed to match the rising energy demands for sustainable development of Nigeria. Although the transition toward using OBRE will incur high capital cost at the initial stage, eventually, it will lead to a cost-effective generation, transmission, environmental improvement and stable energy supply to match demand when compared with the conventional mode of generation in West Africa. Practical implications: This study will be helpful in determining the feasibility, performance, issues and environmental effects related to the generation and transmission of OBRE in the West Africa region. Originality/value: The study will contribute toward analysis of the opportunities for adopting renewable energy sources and increasing energy sustainability for the West Africa coast regions.

AB  - To study changes in emission characteristics for a marine diesel engine fueled with biodiesel blending, this work set up an experiment of marine diesel engine bench with the mixed ratio of diesel to biodiesel fuel of 10: 90. The emission characteristics of gaseous pollutants and particulate matter from the engine were evaluated by the combined bench test and emission analysis, and the smoke reduction mechanism of the biodiesel was determined. The levels of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), and hydrocarbon (HC) in the gaseous emissions decrease due to the high oxygen content of the biodiesel, indicating that harmful gas emission could be reduced when blending biodiesel. The low aromatic hydrocarbon content in the biodiesel reduces the generation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) in combustion products, thereby inhibiting particle formation and reducing particulate matter (PM) emissions and particle number (PN). The excessively fast burning rate reduces the radiation loss of the flame while increasing the temperature in the cylinder, thereby promoting NO x generation. This Promotes the control of waste cooking oil and provides a reference of energy saving and emission reduction in the transportation industry. Â© 2019, Editorial Department of Journal of HEU.

TI  - Application of MDEA decarbonizing technology in CNOOC offshore gas fields: A case history of the CNOOC Dongfang Natural Gas Processing Plant
AB  - Since a number of gas fields with high contents of CO 2 were discovered by CNOOC in South China Sea, the CO 2 removal technology by MDEA has been introduced from abroad. Through cooperation with other related institutes and design departments, CNOOC has made great efforts to build its own large-scale CO 2 removal units by MDEA in the Dongfang Natural Gas Processing Plant. This process includes two-level grading absorption from lean solution to semi-lean solution and two-stage desorption from decompression to stripping, and the most important of all, the MDEA can be regenerated and recycled in the process. In this way, benefits have been achieved such as a low unit cost, a high degree of CO 2 removal, low power consumption, little loss of solvents, and so forth. This CO 2 removal unit is under smooth and steady operation for 350 days each year and the CO 2 content of the purified gas after treatment is less than 1.5% meeting the requirement of gas quality for downstream gas consumers. After many years' actual operation, this large-scale CO 2 removal unit by MDEA is proved to be feasible and reliable enough to be widely applied in many other fields operated by CNOOC.

TI  - Wave energy resource assessment for eastern Bay of Bengal and Malacca Strait
AB  - Maritime countries are benefited by wave energy resources. There has been some initiatives for assessing the wave resources along the South East Asia (SEA) countries, however among the SEA the coastal regions facing the Indian Ocean are least studied. This study focuses on the estimation of wave energy in the eastern Bay of Bengal and Malacca Strait. Major part of these regions are exposed to swells from the South Indian Ocean and affected by the predominant monsoons, especially the SW monsoon. A third generation wave model has been used to simulate the wind-waves over a domain covering the Indian Ocean, South China Sea and part of the Western Pacific Ocean (20Â° - 140Â°E, 60Â°S - 35Â°N) during a ten year period (1997â€“2006). The wave model has been forced with ECMWF re-analysis winds available for every 6 h in 0.75Â° Ã— 0.75Â° spatial resolution. The model results have been used to estimate the wave power. Monthly, seasonal and annual mean wave powers are assessed. In addition, inter-annual variability has been analysed and discussed. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd

Elucidation of the effects of land-use conversion on soil properties and stoichiometry is essential for addressing climate change and ecological conservation. In this study, five land-use types in a reclaimed area were chosen to compare the differences of soil properties and stoichiometry, which comprised paddy, upland, upland-forest, forest, and vegetable garden, with a soil age of about 100 years. The results indicated that these land-use types significantly differed in soil water concentration, pH, bulk density, soil salt concentration, soil organic carbon content, total nitrogen content, and total phosphorus, as well as C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios. Positive correlations were found among soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus; and among pH, bulk density, and soil salt concentration. Total phosphorus and soil organic carbon contents were the main factors shaping the topsoil among the land-use types. Contents of soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus in paddy and vegetable garden soils were higher than that in upland and upland-forest soils, while bulk density, pH, and soil salt concentration showed the opposite trends. Forest soil demonstrated intermediate values for most properties. And the highest C:N occurred in the upland and vegetable garden, the highest C:P in paddy and vegetable garden, while the lowest C:N and C:P occurred in upland-forest. The highest and lowest N:P occurred in paddy and upland, respectively. The stoichiometric characteristics presented a narrow range of the ratio, and the C:N:P averaged 48:3:1 similar to the stoichiometry of average Chinese cropland soils. Rotations including legume, the use of organic fertilizers, and appropriate fertilization strategies were suggested for improving cropland management. Â© 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Investigation on the performance of the 15kW OTEC system
AB  - In the paper, the performance of two cycle systems, Rankine and Kalina-11 (KSC-11) are compared. The conclusion of this comparison yields the Kalina-11 cycle superior. In the KSC-11 cycle, it is found that the optimal ammonia fraction exists in the system under a fixed turbine inlet pressure. And the corresponding optimal turbine exists in the system under a constant ammonia fraction. When the ocean temperature difference is 19Â°C the ammonia fraction has little effect on the 15kW OTEC KSC-11 system maximal net power with the corresponding optimal turbine inlet pressure of 0.6~0.75MPa. When the ammonia fraction is 0.95, the system has the best combined performance. And the corresponding optimal turbine inlet pressure is revealed to be 0.75MPa. The ratio of total heat exchanger area to net power produced Î³ is discovered to be 6~7 m2/kW. Copyright Â© 2010 by ASME.

TI  - Space@Sea the Floating Solution
AB  - This paper describes the Horizon 2020 project Space@Sea (www.spaceatseaproject.eu) which started in November 2017. This project aims to provide a concept of affordable and flexible floating islands. With increasing population and rising sea level there is a scarcity for space on land for the people to live, grow food and harvest renewable energy. Moreover, a large number of people live in areas that are exposed to the risk of flooding in case of sea level rise. These trends call for a solution at sea that creates a new perspective. Previous projects on floating habitation such as the TROPOS project (www.Troposplatform.eu) have delivered artist impressions. Technical solutions are yet to be provided. In the Space@Sea project a conceptual study is done to develop a standardized floating solution for offshore space. Four applications focusing on energy hub, living, aquaculture and maritime transport will be demonstrated. For two locations a business case of a combination of these applications will be examined. The present paper discusses the Space@Sea project background and approach of the collaborative research. First results regarding the basic design and societal acceptance are discussed at a high level. Throughout the Space@Sea project results will be published on Frontiers in Marine Science.

TI  - Engineering forecasts and monitoring for offshore construction operations
AB  - A successful offshore construction operation such as platform installation, decommissioning and subsea pipeline construction relies on good engineering and planning before the operation. Good planning is helped by having the ability to use the first available weather window to carry out the operation at the field offshore. Therefore, the ability to forecast the governing engineering criteria during the operation becomes an essential component. This paper presents the developed methodology to forecast events and a summary of the status of the development, including its limitations and applications. It is focused in three areas: forecast and monitor the dynamic motion characteristics of the operation, pile stick-up motion for jacket installation, and prediction of sagbend bending moment during subsea pipeline construction. It is concluded by presenting the proposed future development and advantages. Â© 2014 SNAME Maritime Convention 2014, SMC 2014. All rights reserved.

TI  - The influence of an unstable turbulent wind spectrum on the loads and motions on floating Offshore Wind Turbines
AB  - Floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT) are exposed to harsh environmental conditions and often experience unstable atmospheric conditions. Including the effects of atmospheric stability should improve the accuracy of fatigue load calculations, and subsequently, the design of the wind turbine. The current standards recommend two turbulence spectral models that are valid for neutral atmospheric conditions only. The objective of this study is to investigate the influence of Hejstrup's 1981 Unstable Spectra Model on the loads and motions on a spar and a semi-submersible FOWT. This study focuses on the effect of unstable atmospheric conditions in the free stream wind and does not include the effect of wakes. The most significant differences observed in this study were for the tower top torsion loads, where very unstable conditions gave 47% larger loads than neutral conditions for OC3-Hywind turbine and 30.4% larger for OC4-DeepCwind turbine. Since very unstable conditions corresponded to the highest turbulence intensities and larger turbulent fluctuations, they also resulted in higher fatigue loads. The blade root flap-wise loads were also observed to be higher under unstable conditions compared to neutral conditions, but the differences were smaller with 7.5% for OC3-Hywind and 23% for OC4-DeepCwind.

TI  - A decade of wave power development in India - The challenges
AB  - Wave energy research in India started in 1984. Six years of research by the Indian wave energy group culminated in the installation of a 150 kW capacity pilot wave power plant in Vizhinjam, off Trivandrum in the Kerala state, in the Arabian Sea during 1990 (Figure 1). The problems encountered during the research, construction and installation directed the group to continue the research effort. The structural configuration of the caisson has changed considerably so that it has sufficient floating stability during towing, enough space for sand ballasting to increase the stability of the caisson against horizontal sliding and overturning and sufficient space at the rear of the caisson for berthing vessels (Figures 2 and 3). After the installation of a wave power caisson of 150 kW off Trivandrum, further attention was focused on a 1 to 2 MW wave power plant for sites, where new breakwaters for harbors is envisaged (Thangassery Harbour in the West Coast of India (Figure 4) and Mus Bay in Car Nicobar Islands (Figure 5) in Bay of Bengal). Optimum center to center spacing between the caissons was determined based on physical model studies. Further research was carried out to improve the wave to pneumatic efficiency by changing the harbor configuration. Techniques to reduce the wave force on the caisson were also simultaneously studied. The wave power economics is site specific. Two sites (Thangassery in Kerala and Mus bay in Car Nicobar Island) were selected to analyze the wave power economics. Wave power is not likely to become economical in the near future. A continued research effort in the research is very important in order to improve the efficiency of wave power conversion and reduce the cost of construction. A decade of experience (1986 to 1996) in wave power research is presented in this paper.

TI  - Analysis method for the design of long submarine cables
AB  - The recent push for renewable electrical energy sources has resulted in a significant increase in the installation of the offshore wind farms. These farms become much bigger than their earlier counterparts and the generated power is much larger. This puts additional performance requirements on the export cables. Long submarine export cables are not only subjected to changing laying conditions along the route, including depth and seabed material variations, but also the loading patterns vary significantly over time. Additionally, applied reactive power compensation measures and the time-dependent grid situation change the distribution of the current along the route. These unique features of long submarine power cables necessitate a new type of approach to their design and construction optimization. This paper introduces a new approach for ampacity calculations of long submarine power cables. As the ampacity calculations form a basis for the design of a cable route, it is of paramount importance that they are performed as accurately as possible. The approach can be applied to general-purpose circuit solvers, and this paper describes how to implement it using the ATP-EMTP software, which is extended to the consideration of concurrent electrical and thermal effects. The approach permits considering all the important local and time-dependent parameters of the analysis simultaneously. In particular, the approach allows simultaneous analysis of the varying laying conditions along the route including changes in the depth of burial and thermal resistivity of the soil together with the temporal variations of the cable loading. Additionally, current characteristics in long AC cable conductors are strongly affected by the reactive power flow, which in turn depends on the location of the reactive power compensation, the reactive power demand for grid operation, and the wind farm voltage reactive power control strategy. Such analysis cannot be performed with any existing analytical tool. Also, numerical tools cannot handle such problems because a 3-dimensional time-dependent analysis of a cable route which is 100 km long would encounter convergence problems as the size of such model would be prohibitive. Hence, at present, the proposed approach is the only one available to solve this complex electro-thermal problem. Several numerical examples illustrate an application of the proposed methodology.

TI  - Multi-criteria evaluation of wave energy projects on the south-east Australian coast
AB  - In the last decade, multiple studies focusing on national-scale assessments of the ocean wave energy resource in Australia identified the Southern Margin to be one of the most energetic areas worldwide suitable for the extraction of wave energy for electricity production. While several companies have deployed single unit devices, the next phase of development will most likely be the deployment of parks with dozens of units, introducing the risk of conflicts within the marine space. This paper presents a geo-spatial multi-criteria evaluation approach to identify optimal locations to deploy a wave energy farm while minimizing potential conflicts with other coastal and offshore users. The methodology presented is based around five major criteria: ocean wave climatology, nature of the seabed, distance to key infrastructure, environmental factors and potential conflict with other users such as shipping and fisheries. A case study is presented for an area off the south-east Australian coast using a total of 18 physical, environmental and socio-economic parameters. The spatial restrictions associated with environmental factors, wave climate, as well as conflict of use, resulted in an overall exclusion of 20% of the study area. Highly suitable areas identified ranged between 11 and 34% of the study area based on scenarios with varying criteria weighting. By spatially comparing different scenarios we identified persistence of a highly suitable area of 700Â km2 off the coast of Portland across all model domains investigated. We demonstrate the value of incorporation spatial information at the scale relevant to resource exploitation when examining multiple criteria for optimal site selection of Wave Energy Converters over broad geographic regions.

TI  - Modeling hydro-environmental impacts of tidal range renewable energy projects in coastal waters
AB  - Details are given of the growing worldwide interest in tidal renewable energy projects, including tidal stream devices and tidal range structures (i.e. barrages and lagoons), but the main emphasis in this chapter is on tidal range renewable energy structures. In investigating the hydro-environmental impacts of such tidal energy schemes, both for regional and far field effects, a 2D numerical model has been refined to predict the hydrodynamic impacts, including wake effects and flood risk and hazard impacts, and changes in the concentration distribution of conservative and nonconservative solutes, including primarily salinity, turbidity, fecal indicator organisms, and phosphorous and nitrogen levels. The model has been applied to a number of key sites and particularly in the Severn Estuary, UK, which has the second highest tidal range worldwide. The key schemes considered and reported herein include: (i) a series of lagoons along the North Wales coast and (ii) a barrage across the mouth of the Severn Estuary. The main findings are that: (i) two-way generation offers the best options for maintaining the current conditions in the region as closely as possible, (ii) boundary conditions need to be generated from the Continental Shelf, (iii) momentum conservation is crucial for turbine representation, (iv)lagoons interact with one another, reducing efficiency, (v) the design of turbine distribution is critical for optimum efficiency and minimal environmental change.

The results presented in this paper can be considered as the milestone of the offshore wind research in Shandong Province since there is still no grid codes for offshore wind power plant grid connection in the local electrical power grid. It mainly consists of three parts. In the first part, a detailed model of the offshore wind farm created in the DIgSILENT PowerFacotry simulation platform is presented, including wind turbines, power converters, transformers, submarine cables and relevant control schemes. In the second part, nonlinear time-domain simulations were performed to analyze the wind farm's active power, reactive power, and voltage conditions under different wind scenarios. Based on the simulations results, a dynamic reactive power compensation system was proposed, and the consequence of the reactive power compensation was also demonstrated using nonlinear time-domain simulations.

TI  - The influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation on diverse renewable generation in Scotland
AB  - The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is an index measure of the pressure gradient between Iceland and Portugal, with the pressure gradient affecting the strength and track of storms across the North Atlantic and into Europe. This has implications for renewable generation, which are becoming increasingly important with higher renewable penetrations. To explore the impact of the NAO on renewables a hindcast of wave, onshore and offshore wind generation in Scotland was created for the most recent climate normal period (1981-2010). These hindcast generation figures were compared to NAO monthly index values and showed a strong and significant positive correlation for the high energy portion of the year (October to March). The strength of this relationship is in some instances, most notably for wave generation, weakened by the higher energy positive NAO conditions causing increased device cut-out. The impact of the NAO was also modelled at a seasonal winter scale (December-March) as is usual in NAO analysis. The model showed the strongest influence on capacity factor for offshore wind, with each increase in NAO index of 1 causing a predicted increase of capacity factor of 3.17 (compared to 2.59 for onshore wind, 1.35 for wave, and 2.49 for the combined portfolio). In January and February, the NAO has a statistically significant impact on hindcast generation variability, at a 1-4 h time scale for all resources and 1-24 h timescale for onshore wind and wave, which will have implications for system management.

TI  - Layout optimisation of offshore wave energy converters using a novel multi-swarm cooperative algorithm with backtracking strategy: A case study from coasts of Australia
AB  - Wave energy technologies have the potential to play a significant role in the supply of renewable energy worldwide. One of the most promising designs for wave energy converters (WECs) are fully submerged buoys. In this paper, we explore the optimisation of WEC arrays consisting of three-tether buoys. Such arrays can be optimised for total energy output by adjusting the relative positions of buoys in a wave farm. As there are complex hydrodynamic interactions among WECs, the evaluation of each parameter setting is computationally expensive and thus limits the feasible number of full model evaluations that can be made. Furthermore, these WEC interactions make up a non-convex, multi-modal (with multiple local-optima), continuous and constrained optimisation problem. This problem is challenging to solve using optimisation methods. To tackle the challenge of optimising the positions of WECs in a wave farm, we propose a novel multi-swarm cooperative co-evolution algorithm which consists of three meta-heuristics: the multi verse optimiser (MVO) algorithm, the equilibrium optimisation (EO) method, and the moth flame optimisation (MFO) approach with a backtracking strategy, we introduce a fast, effective new surrogate model to speed up the process of optimisation. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed approach, 11 state-of-the-art bio-inspired algorithms and three recent hybrid heuristic techniques were compared in six real wave situations located on the coasts of Australia, with two wave farm sizes (four and nine WECs). The experimental study presented in this paper shows that our hybrid cooperative framework exhibited the best performance in terms of the quality of obtained solutions, computational efficiency, and convergence speed compared with other 14 state-of-the-art meta-heuristics. Furthermore, we found that the power output of the best-found 9-buoy arrangements were higher than that of perpendicular layouts at at 4.15%, 3.29%, 3.62%, 9.2%, 5.74%, and 2.43% for the Perth, Adelaide, Sydney, Tasmania, Brisbane, and Darwin wave sites, respectively. Our investigations reveal that the best-found arrangement at the Tasmania wave site was able to absorb the highest level of wave power relative to the other locations. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - OFFSHORE ENGINEERING - NEW TECHNOLOGY NEEDED BEFORE THE OIL BONANZA.
AB  - The southern North Sea basin contains large gas reserves in the Permian Sandstones, the gas probably originating from the carbonization of coal in the underlying carboniferous coal measures, the structures mostly sealed by Upper Permian salt. The northern North Sea basin is probably one of the most prolific oil regions for its size in the world. Proven oil reserves in the North Sea area is now about 14 multiplied by 10**9 barrels, of which about 11 multiplied by 10**9 barrels are located in the UK sector. The ultimate recovery of oil from the whole North Sea area is still put at about 40 multiplied by 10**9 barrels, of which about two-thirds should be found under UK waters. The offtake pattern for the North Sea gas discoveries shows that in the southern area, production levels off at around 5 multiplied by 10**9 cubic feet a day during the period 1980-1982. The first UK offshore oil production is planned for the end of this year from the Argyll field of the Hamilton Group. This will be based on submarine well completions using a semi-submersible production platform and offshore loading, with production rates of 40,000 barrels a day. The three ongoing major field developments of Forties, Brent and Piper, jointly capable of peak production of 900,000 barrels a day before 1980 are, however, based on large drilling and production platforms. Each platform has a capacity of 125,000 barrels a day or more and large diameter submarine pipes will link Forties to Cruden Bay, Piper to the Orkneys and Brent to the Shetlands. A typical steel platform, together with piles and decks, can use about 50,000 tons of steel. An alternative platform is the concrete Condeep design. This requires a deep water fabrication site and has the great advantage of complete fabrication of jacket and decks near shore.

TI  - A review of reliability analysis of offshore scour protections
AB  - The R&D project Oracle - offshore risk analysis for climate change adaptation and lifetime extension - is focused on optimising the design of scour protection schemes for the extended lifetime of offshore foundations. This project proposes an optimisation of scour protections by combining reliability-based techniques with the novel concepts of dynamic and wide-graded armour layers. The ultimate goal is to develop a decision support system (DSS) for scour protection design and risk and reliability analysis to be used by professionals and researchers dealing with fixed foundations applied to marine renewable energy projects (e.g. wind, wave and tidal). However, a meaningful implementation of such a DSS implies prior analysis of several knowledge gaps related to scour protection in the offshore environment, which are yet to be fully addressed in the literature. This paper provides a brief review of the scientific and technical challenges in the research field of reliability of offshore scour protection. On the basis of identified challenges, the discussion of future research lines is performed with a particular focus on the aim of the Oracle project. The recent findings related to risk and reliability analysis of offshore scour protection are addressed and framed within the existing knowledge gaps in the literature.

TI  - Spatial Variability of Organic Carbon, CaCO3 and Nutrient Burial Rates Spanning a Mangrove Productivity Gradient in the Coastal Everglades
AB  - Mangrove wetlands are some of the most important locations of organic carbon (OC) sequestration and storage in the world on a per area basis. The high stocks of soil OC are driven by generally high burial rates and efficient preservation of organic material over past millennia of relatively slow and consistent sea level rise. Although the global average rate of OC burial in mangrove wetlands is relatively high, the range in the literature varies by up to two orders of magnitude. The objective of this research was to measure burial rates of OC, CaCO3, and nutrients {[}total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorous (TP)] across a pronounced ecosystem gradient of productivity and salinity in the coastal Everglades of southwestern Florida, USA. Concentrations and burial rates of both CaCO3 (range 13-1233gm(-2)y(-1)) and TP (range 0.10-1.59gm(-2)y(-1)) decreased significantly with distance from the Gulf of Mexico. In contrast, there was less spatial variability in OC (134 +/- 12 (1 SE) gm(-2)y(-1)) and TN (6.2 +/- 0.4gm(-2)y(-1)) burial rates. However, significant (P<0.001) regional differences in OC burial rates were observed relative to mangrove primary productivity. Over a centennial timescale, downstream sites buried 14\% of annual net primary production, midstream sites buried 22\%, and upstream sites preserved less than 10\%.

TI  - Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals That Municipal Wastewater Effluent Enhances Vibrio vulnificus Growth and Virulence Potential
AB  - Vibrio vulnificus is an opportunistic pathogen indigenous to estuarine and marine environments and associated with aquatic organisms. Vibrio vulnificus is of utmost importance because it causes 95% of the seafood-related deaths in the United States due to rapid progression of septicemia. Changes in environmental parameters associated with climate change and coastal population expansion are altering geographical constraints, resulting in increased Vibrio spread, exposure, and rates of infection. In addition, coastal population expansion is resulting in increased input of treated municipal sewage into areas that are also experiencing increased Vibrio proliferation. This study aimed to better understand the influence of treated sewage effluent on effluent-receiving microbial communities using Vibrio as a model of an opportunistic pathogen. Integrated transcriptomic approaches were used to analyze the changes in overall gene expression of V. vulnificus NBRC 15645 exposed to wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent for a period of 6h using a modified seawater yeast extract media that contained 0, 50, and 100% filtered WWTP effluent. RNA-seq reads were mapped, annotated, and analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes using the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center analysis tool. The study revealed that V. vulnificus responds to wastewater effluent exposure by activating cyclic-di-GMP-influenced biofilm development. Also, genes involved in crucial functions, such as nitrogen metabolism and bacterial attachment, were upregulated depending on the presence of treated municipal sewage. This altered gene expression increased V. vulnificus growth and proliferation and enhanced genes and pathways involved in bacterial survival during the early stages of infection in a host. These factors represent a potential public health risk due to exposure to environmental reservoirs of potentially Vibrio strains with enhanced virulence profiles in coastal areas.

TI  - Generator in situ inspection
AB  - Assessing power generators condition utilizing periodic inspection programs has been an established practise in power plants with proven reliability and availability results. However, the continuous efforts to reduce maintenance costs while minimizing the outage periods opened the path towards the development of alternative inspection tools and services that facilitate rapid offline assessment of equipment inspection. The conventional technique of pulling out a generator rotor in order to have an access over the stator is time consuming and requires extensive logistic preparation in addition to high exposure risks. Moreover, utilizing an advanced technology tool for online measurements such as robotic devices for In-Situ inspection provide an economical, fast and low risk alternative solutions. Ras Tanura Producing Department (RTPD) from Saudi Aramco has successfully implemented In-Situ inspections for two power generators at one of its plants. This paper compares the conventional rotor out inspection with In-situ technology techniques that allow inspection and testing while the rotor is still installed whereas will highlight a case study in which In-Situ technology was implemented on RTPD generators.

AB  - River deltas have contributed to atmospheric carbon regulation throughout Earth history, but functioning in the modern era has been impaired by reduced sediment loads, altered hydrologic regimes, increased global sea-level rise and accelerated subsidence. Delta restoration involves environmental engineering via river diversions, which utilize self-organizing processes to create prograding deltas. Here we analyse sediment cores from Wax Lake delta, a product of environmental engineering, to quantify the burial of organic carbon. We find that, despite relatively low concentrations of organic carbon measured in the cores (about 0.4\%), the accumulation of about 3 T m(-2) of sediment over the approximate 60 years of delta building resulted in the burial of a significant amount of organic carbon (16 kg m(-2)). This equates to an apparent organic carbon accumulation rate of 250 +/- 23 g m(-2) yr(-1), which implicitly includes losses by carbon emissions and erosion. Our estimated accumulation rate for Wax Lake delta is substantially greater than previous estimates based on the top metre of delta sediments and comparable to those of coastal mangrove and marsh habitats. The sedimentation of carbon at the Wax Lake delta demonstrates the capacity of engineered river diversions to enhance both coastal accretion and carbon burial.

TI  - Nonlinear local structural modelling and analysis of the interface for a hybrid wind and wave energy converter concept
AB  - A hybrid wind and wave energy converter concept, which consists of a spar floating wind turbine and a coaxial wave energy converter named the STC (Spar Torus Combination) concept, has been proposed to achieve better utilization of the ocean space and energy, synergy of the wind and wave conversion, and to reduce the energy cost. The torus moves along the spar cylinder in operational conditions. The critical component of this concept is the interface between wave energy converter and spar floater. Nonlinear local structural modelling of the interface is performed and presented in this paper. The wave energy converter is designed to be connected mechanically to the spar floater by a series of rollers through hydraulic supports. Rubber rollers are used to reduce the contact stress. Different configurations of the spar structure at the interface with the torus are investigated. Quasi-static analyses are carried out. Numerical and experimental studies of the global behavior have been performed, and the results are used as input to the local structural analysis.

TI  - Information flow to increase support for tidal energy development in remote islands of a developing country: agent-based simulation of information flow in Flores Timur Regency, Indonesia
AB  - Background: Public awareness is crucial for successful deployment of tidal energy, a renewable energy source that can provide clean electricity to remote islands. However, considering public attitudes on tidal energy are not well known, especially in developing countries, a barrier exists in implementing public engagement strategies. This study aims to contribute by identifying strategies for information provisionâ€”the initial step in public engagementâ€”and estimate how these can be engaged to enhance support for tidal energy among the local public in a remote area of a developing country, in this case, Flores Timur Regency, Indonesia, considering their socio-cultural background. Methods: In this paper, we employ statistical analyses using multinomial probit modelling to identify the key variables that shape information flow. The aptness of the variables is then verified using post-estimation techniques for their use as input parameters for the simulation of the information flow in the field study area. Agent-based simulation (ABS) is employed to replicate the actual conditions in Flores Timur Regency, Indonesia, and simulate the flow of information through the local community. Results: According to the multinomial probit estimations, the people belonging to the top hierarchical group show a higher probability to support tidal energy compared to the members belonging to the lower groups. Understandably, around twice as many information flow cycles are needed to disseminate information to the members of the lowest hierarchical group, compared to the members of the top hierarchical group. The results also show that increasing the amount of available information has a positive impact on information dissemination. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that information provision is highly effective with propagation of information that specifically highlights the individual benefits, rather than the community benefits of tidal energy. Additionally, savings in terms of costs, time, and efforts can be realized if the most influential members of the local community are targeted initially before including all other stakeholders. The study also indicated that locals absorb more information and increase their support for tidal energy when additional data is made available. Finally, as long-term strategy, information provision becomes most effective when the local population gains higher educational capabilities. Â© 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - On the development of an in-house fines stabilizer to control formationdamage
AB  - Almost all Malaysian hydrocarbon-bearing sandstone reservoirs contain minerals which are potentialsources of mobile fine particles. For this reason, formation damage in injection and production wells hasbeen frequently associated with the migration of fines in reservoir pores. In this work, an effective, novel,environment friendly and cost beneficial fines stabilizer is formulated in-house. The developed chemical works on the principles of coagulation and flocculation. Different coagulant andflocculant chemical combinations are trialed, and the understanding of their performance is shared usingturbidity and zeta potential testing. The developed fines stabilizer chemical is later tested for compatibilitywith reservoir fluids and production chemicals of a field which is planning to apply fines stabilizer. Basedon the potentiality in static screening results of turbidity, zeta potential and compatibility, a fines stabilizeris chosen for dynamic testing. The constraint of critical flow rate for fines migration is addressed in dynamic study using core floodexperimentation. Critical flow rates are determined by forward and reverse injection into core samples.Accordingly, the performance of in-house synthesized fines stabilizer is judged by enhancement in criticalflow rate in comparison to untreated and commercial fines stabilizer treated cores. Since the constraint fromthe critical rate effects injectivity and productivity, modification of this constraint and increase of the criticalrate consequently provides more economic benefit. The additional revenue from oil production by using thein-house developed fines stabilizer chemical is estimated, and the costs are compared with a commercialfines stabilizer. The uniqueness of this endeavor is in developing an in-house fines stabilizer chemical which can beused after acidizing, enhanced oil recovery treatment, in production and injection wells. The synthesizedin-house formulation is more effective and cost saving compared to commercial fines stabilizer. Â© 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Barycenter Self-Adapting Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Sea Water Wave High-Entropy Energy Harvesting and Self-Powered Forecasting in Marine Meteorology
AB  - As a high entropy energy (HEE), irregular seawater waves are a promising source of sustainable energy, and the development of matched harvesting technology is imperative to accommodate the new era. Here, a barycenter self-adapting triboelectric nanogenerator (BSA-TENG) that addresses these concerns and shows its applications as a distributed power source in isolated waters is reported. Benefitting from the physical gravity-guided structure design, random vibrational water wave HEE can be effectively converted into rotational mechanical energy and then converted into electric energy. In a nonlinear seawater wave pool, a unit delivers a peak power of 0.1 mW under a load resistance of 500 M omega when the working frequency is <1 Hz. On this basis, a self-powered temperature sensor system and wireless signal transmitter have been developed and driven entirely by the BSA-TENG. This work plays a key role in promoting ocean HEE harvesting and provides a workable way for a self-powered service system in seawater wave and marine meteorology monitoring and forecasting.

TI  - A Novel DC Chopper With MOV-Based Modular Solid-State Switch and Concentrated Dissipation Resistor for +/- 400 kV/1100 MW Offshore Wind VSC-HVDC System
AB  - A dc chopper (DCC) is one of the key equipment in voltage-sourced converter-based high-voltage dc transmission systems with offshore wind power access. Combining the complementary advantages of concentrated and modular DCCs, a novel DCC with modular solid-state switches and a concentrated resistor (MC-DCC) is proposed. The non-long-term work attribute of the DCC provides opportunities to apply metal oxide varistors in modularizing series solid-state switches, thereby removing the capacitors for voltage balance. A method of designing the MC-DCC is introduced on the basis of the analysis of system requirement. Finally, prototype experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the MC-DCC.

TI  - Towards widespread properties of cellulosic fibers composites: A comprehensive review
AB  - To meet the growing demand for the use of environmentally and friendly materials in various applications, many efforts have been done in order to provide lighweighting, biodegradable, and renewable composites leading to a diminution of greenhouse gas emissions. However, they are confronting some challenges that may limit their utilization in industries such as poor interfacial adherence, high moisture absorption, low processing temperature, and impact strength. Several research works have been carried out regarding the mechanical, thermal, and hydric properties of natural fibers reinforced composites to deal with above underlined drawbacks. Actually, based on our analysis, there are two relevant concerns that prevent their integration in other industries such as marine and renewable energy sectors. In this context, the current critical review offers an up to date overview of the factors influencing the properties of the different components of natural fibers composites (fiber, matrix, fiber/matrix interface) as well as their physicochemical, mechanical, thermal and hydric behaviors. Recent works on the mechanical properties of nanobiocomposites based on cellulosic fibers, crystals, and nano-clay fillers are reviewed. The future directions are also discussed to overcome the challenges confronted by these materials, that is, fire resistance and moisture absorption, in order to widespread their utilization especially for wet and fire retardant purposes.

TI  - CO2 EOR and Sequestration Technologies in PetroChina
AB  - CO2 geological sequestration and Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) application is one of the possible ways to reduce the emission of CO2 and manage the risk of global climate change. Since 2005, China has restarted the research of CO2 flooding and storage for non-marine reservoirs and conducted pilot and extended test in Songliao Basin, from which significant progress has been achieved in CO2 EOR technologies. The main progress we achieved included oil-CO2 miscible phase behavior, CO2 EOR reservoir engineering method, separated layer CO2 injection technologies, bottom hole corrosion monitoring system and effective lift technologies, long-distance pipeline transportation and supercritical CO2 injection technology, produced fluid treatment with CO2 EOR application and cycling gas injection technology, CO2 flooding reservoir monitoring and performance analysis and evaluation method, potential evaluation and strategic planning for CO2 EOR and storage. Tests in Block Hei59, Block Hei79 and Block Hei46 of Daqingzijing Oil Field show that CO2 EOR method can improve the oil recovery more than 10%, and the CO2 geological sequestration rate is above 90%.

TI  - Monitor method of offshore wind turbine based on memory-like and neural network expert system
AB  - The number of offshore wind farms increases gradually because of the high capability of power generation. However, the costs of manufacturing, logistics, installation and maintenance of offshore wind turbine are higher than those of onshore wind turbine. Thus the introduction of fault diagnosis is considered as a suitable way to improve reliability of wind turbine and reduce costs of repairs and casualties. In this paper, 3 major failures of direct-driven wind turbine according to urgency and system responses are discussed. A "memory-like" model pretreatment method and a fault diagnosis method for the failures are investigated. The simulation results show that total amount of fault data to be processed and stored is reduced, and difficulties of knowledge gaining and fault reasoning are also decreased.

TI  - Seizing energy from water- Best-kept dutch secret
AB  - The Dutch Directorate General for Public Works and Water Management and Deltares are the driving forces behind innovations in renewable energy generation from water in the Netherlands. The Netherlands is now facing the task of actually starting to realize all the opportunities. Energy from water must be given a stimulus in the same way as was done for solar and wind energy. A pilot has been set up with Ecofys (Eneco Energy) Wave Rotor in the Western Scheldt. These rotors generate energy from tidal flows and wash. This design corresponds to the principle of the Darrieus wind turbine, which has vertical blades that are vertically adjustable. Another way of generating energy from water is osmotic power. Using membrane technology, energy can be generated from salt and fresh water on the basis of reverse electrodialysis, or osmosis. The WINN program is searching out these opportunities.

TI  - Developing an integrated hybrid polygeneration system combined with utility steam network
AB  - In this study, an integrated hybrid polygeneration system based on solar and biogas energy is developed for simultaneous heat and power generation and hydrogen production. A heat recovery system is employed, which can recover the waste heat from the flue gas for effective utilisation in the steam network. The devised system, comprising solar, biogas, chemical, steam, and power islands, is investigated and comparatively evaluated through energy and exergy approaches. Additionally, an optimisation study is carried out to find the optimal exergy efficiency. The findings suggest that integrating the steam island and hybrid system improved the overall system performance significantly.

TI  - Voltage Feedback based Harmonic Compensation for an Offshore Wind Power Plant
AB  - When an offshore wind power plant is connected to the grid, there is a risk of amplification of certain harmonics and appearance resonances at the point of connection due to the interaction between the grid network and the wind power plant network. Hence, the plant developer is obliged to maintain the harmonic distortion at the point of common coupling within the planning level limits using harmonic compensation, which is usually done by passive filters. In this paper a novel active harmonic compensation technique using voltage feedback from a non-local bus has been proposed and analyzed. Its effectiveness has been demonstrated through real time simulations on a test system model.

TI  - Cessao Onerosa FPSOs - Challenges and achievements conducting four simultaneous hull conversion designs
AB  - Under the development of the Brazilian pre-salt onerous concession areas Petrobras contracted Enseada Industria Naval for the conversion of 4 (four) VLCC ships into the hulls of FPSOs P74, P75. P76 and P77, for which PROJEMAR have awarded a contract for the complete hull conversion engineering design. Even with the accumulated experience on the design of 12 (twelve) FPSOs conversions, nothing could be compared with 4 (four) ships being simultaneously converted in two shipyards, being one in Brazil and one in China, to receive 4 (four) Process Plants weighting about 35.000 t designed by 3 (three) different Topsides engineering designers. This paper intends to describe the main challenges and achievements of the engineering design work for the conversion design of the 4 (four) FPSOs, where the need to maximize standardization conflicted with the different hull configuration of the VLCCs that were being converted, with the different production characteristics of the two shipyards involved on the conversion work and with the different design philosophies of the Topsides engineering designers. These can be exemplified by: â€¢ The need to face single hull and double side VLCCs that were built in different shipyards in Korea and Japan, what led to different main deck reinforcement and different strategies for steel renew; â€¢ The different Topsides engineering led to different main deck reinforcements for the Topsides equipment and structures; â€¢ The main equipment was standardized, but the different ship's hull structure led to different structural solutions, and smaller equipment were acquired from local suppliers close to shipyards; â€¢ Different arrangements and tanks configuration led to different piping designs; â€¢ A new standard accommodation block needed to be fitted in different main deck structure configurations; â€¢ Individual motions analyses were carried out for each FPSO, but needed to be validated by a unique model tests program; â€¢ etc In summary, maximize the design standardization is a key path to improve construction productivity, but as an FPSO conversion design is essentially a tailor made activity, this duality was highly pronounced when dealing with the multiple simultaneous activities of the Cessao Onerosa FPSOs design.

TI  - Mini Review on Electrocatalyst Design for Seawater Splitting: Recent Progress and Perspectives
AB  - Production of renewable hydrogen energy by water electrolysis is an effective method to reduce carbon emissions. In comparison to freshwater, seawater is a more suitable raw material for electrolysis thanks to its abundant reserves. However, the reported catalysts are not suitable for large-scale commercial application as a result of the reduction of catalyst stability and activity within complex natural seawater. To better promote the rational design of electrocatalysts and tackle the challenges of seawater splitting, this mini review summarized recent advances in rational design electrocatalysts for seawater splitting, including constructing a hierarchical structure, decorating a corrosion resistance layer, and introducing a charge redistribution within the system. Afterward, a perspective in the development of large-scale seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production is also proposed. Â© 2021 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Design and Evaluation of a Tidal In-Stream Generator Power Port
AB  - Oceanic currents and tidal streams are a predictable and vast source of energy. The astronomical nature of the underlying forces causing such streams, results in speed variations that change at certain time intervals. There are different methods for harnessing part of this vast and renewable source of energy; however, regardless of the method used, integrating a large-scale tidal in-stream energy converter into a conventional power system poses many challenges, in particular, in weaker networks. Injection of the captured stream power to a nonstiff network changes the magnitude of the voltage at different times of the day. The impact on the voltage magnitude is commonly most critical if tidal generators and consumers share the same medium voltage feeder, which is a case that seems inevitable especially when considering the electrically remote but energy-rich areas of estuaries, oceanfronts, and natural water channels. This investigation provides designing details of a hybrid power port solution that establishes an independent active and reactive power control, enabling it to regulate the point of common coupling voltage, while transferring variable amounts of captured stream power to a nonstiff grid. To verify the feasibility of the proposed scheme, an example system is designed and tested using a common tidal stream power profile. This investigation is a timely contribution to the emerging field of marine current power generation.

TI  - Impact of enhanced vertical mixing on marine biogeochemistry: lessons for geo-engineering and natural variability
AB  - Artificially enhanced vertical mixing has been suggested as a means by which to fertilize the biological pump with subsurface nutrients and thus increase the oceanic CO2 sink. We use an ocean general circulation and biogeochemistry model (OGCBM) to examine the impact of artificially enhanced vertical mixing on biological productivity and atmospheric CO2, as well as the climatically significant gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and dimethyl sulphide (DMS) during simulations between 2000 and 2020. Overall, we find a large increase in the amount of organic carbon exported from surface waters, but an overall increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations by 2020. We quantified the individual effect of changes in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), alkalinity and biological production on the change in pCO(2) at characteristic sites and found the increased vertical supply of carbon rich subsurface water to be primarily responsible for the enhanced CO2 outgassing, although increased alkalinity and, to a lesser degree, biological production can compensate in some regions. While ocean-atmosphere fluxes of DMS do increase slightly, which might reduce radiative forcing, the oceanic N2O source also expands. Our study has implications for understanding how natural variability in vertical mixing in different ocean regions (such as that observed recently in the Southern Ocean) can impact the ocean CO2 sink via changes in DIC, alkalinity and carbon export.

TI  - Uncertainties in extreme value modelling of wave data in a climate change perspective
AB  - The extreme values of wave climate data are of great interest in a number of different applications, including the design and operation of ships and offshore structures, marine energy generation, aquaculture and coastal installations. Typically, the return values of certain met-ocean parameters such as significant wave height are of particular importance. In a climate change perspective, projections of such return values to a future climate are of great importance for risk management and adaptation purposes. However, there are various ways of estimating the required return values, which introduce additional uncertainties in extreme weather and climate variables pertaining to both current and future climates. Many of these approaches are investigated in this paper by applying different methods to particular data sets of significant wave height, corresponding to the historic climate and two future projections of the climate assuming different forcing scenarios. In this way, the uncertainty due to the extreme value analysis can also be compared to the uncertainty due to a changing climate. The different approaches that are considered in this paper are the initial distribution approach, the block maxima approach, the peak over threshold approach and the average conditional exceedance rate method. Furthermore, the effect of different modelling choices within each of the approaches will be explored. Thus, a range of different return value estimates for the different data sets is obtained. This exercise reveals that the uncertainty due to the extreme value analysis method is notable and, as expected, the variability of the estimates increases for higher return periods. Moreover, even though the variability due to the extreme value analysis is greater than the climate variability, a shift towards higher extremes in a future wave climate can clearly be discerned in the particular datasets that have been analysed.

(eds.), Global Topics and New Trends in Coastal Research: Port, Coastal and Ocean Engineering. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 103, pp. 351-354. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. The large-scale steel pipe pile filled with concrete is usually adopted as the foundation of wind farm in China which subjected to the loads including wind turbine weight, wind, wave, fluent and so on. There is high requirement of bearing capacity and deformation of foundation for the wind turbines and it is difficult to measure the displacement accurately using traditional displacement measurement system because of environmental load variation. This paper presents a new method of displacement measurement that the linear displacement underground can be transformed into angular displacement on the ground, and angular displacement can be transformed into some pulse signal through a snap-sheet device and grating sensor. According to the number of pulse signal, the grating groove density and diameter of the wheel, the corresponding displacement can be calculated, and operating procedures is developed for measurement based on LabVIEW software. This new measurement system has the advantages of easy installation, accuracy measurement, simple operation and high reliability and it has high applicability for offshore pile tests.

TI  - Predictive direct power control strategy for offshore wind power VSC-HVDC converter
AB  - The developed DPC scheme is based on predictive control theory to achieve direct control of instantaneous active and reactive power of the converter. For this purpose, at the beginning of each switching period in the sense of deadbeat control. Therefore it can eliminate the active and reactive power tracking errors at the end of switching period. Meanwhile, combined with space vector modulation (SVM) and the DC bus voltage outer-loop analysis and design, it can obtain the predictive direct power control strategy (P-DPC). When compared to the traditional DPC method, the main features of the proposed P-DPC method, are that it does not need to detect the grid voltage vector position (such as phase-locked loop-PLL, etc.), transfer them into synchronous rotating reference frame and inner-current loop decoupling control. Its switching frequency is fixed. The uncompleted decoupling problem caused by interference of tracking errors and inaccurate parameters are well solved, that improve the system's stability. The unity power factor operation can be realized in stationary reference frame. A PWM-VSC model is set up in Matlab/simulation software, and the results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control methods, which can available for reference in offshore VSC-HVDC engineering.

TI  - A comparative analysis of wind propulsion systems for oceangoing vessels
AB  - Recent increases in fuel prices have spurred interest in energy efficiency and alternative energy technologies. These interests are especially relevant for the marine industry, which is responsible for transporting over 90% of the world's freight. The present global fleet of commercial ships consumes approximately 200 million tonnes of diesel fuel each year - which is expected to rise to around 350 million tonnes a year by 2020 [5]. Studies have been conducted evaluating technologies to increase seagoing propulsion efficiency as well as harness available alternative energy sources. One renewable source, wind, is particularly interesting since 1) it presents a vast source of free energy that has been used throughout much of the history of marine transportation, and 2) novel technologies are available that might make it attractive for modern ships. The purpose of this analysis is to specifically evaluate and compare the ability of two modern wind-based technologies to produce thrust-reducing propulsion power for use in reducing the fuel consumption of a ship, namely a rigid wing sail and Flettner rotor. The analysis focuses on design specifications for each based on existing literature and compares the performance of the two technologies within a specified, but naturally varying wind environment. The force-producing capabilities of each technology are compared as a function of the ship operational parameters of heading and speed. Copyright Â© 2010 by ASME.

TI  - Large module installation and intervention system at aasgard
AB  - With the vision of a "Subsea Factory" the maintenance and repair work on process equipment is moved from topside to subsea. Operators will still have a high regularity requirement for their process plants, meaning that they need to be prepared to perform such complex subsea operations at any time of the year and with a minimum of time spent waiting on weather (WoW). This paper will explain the solutions chosen for the world's first subsea compression system at the Asgard field in the Haltenbanken area in Norway. To meet the regularity requirements for the plant the process modules had to be replaceable in weather conditions up to significant wave heights (Hs) of 4.5m. With module dimensions exceeding vessel moonpool sizes and weights well exceeding 300t, the traditional method for overboarding and retrieval would be to use a large capacity crane. However, crane lifts of large, heavy and complex structures will normally have a weather limitation in the order Hs 1.0m - 2.5m.

TI  - Changeover to renewable energies requires new communication designs. Facility control by satellite [Anlagensteuerung per satellit. Umstieg auf erneuerbare erfordert neue kommunikationskonzepte]
AB  - A discussion covers the use of satellites to supervise, control, and adjust the entire energy supply infrastructure. The transition to renewable energies requires a restructuring of the grid. The key to success lies in polished information and communication technologies. Data exchange via satellite is an attractive alternative to grid-based solutions. Topics of discussion include introduction; grid security in storms and floods; control requires data transfer in real time; data transmission from all world regions; and assembly and alignment of the antenna. The Euroskypark GmbH (ESP) of Saarbrucken makes available to industrial customers satellite-based communication solutions for grid and facility control. With its developments the company contributes to decentralized energy with renewable energies guaranteeing the same security of supply as the existing infrastructure. In striving on and offshore commerce such reliable information and communication solutions are already needed. Terrestrial data transmission has risks such as damage to sea cables. Satellite-based transmission systems are always in hot-standby operation to take over facility control in case of emergency. The data transmission systems developed by ESP are used in most offshore wind parks in this country. These systems are decisive with respect to renewable energies because they supply data even under difficult climatic conditions and from isolated regions that are deficient in infrastructures. The antenna of the offshore wind park must be so directed that a best possible data transmission is guaranteed. The transition to obtaining energy from offshore wind parks in the Baltic and North seas, from solar parks in the Sahara desert, and from millions of solar cells on residential rooftops has long begun and will accelerate in coming years. These energies supplement the large nuclear and fossil power plants. In the future the decentralized and centralized sources of power must all be integrated into the power grid. A new intelligent infrastructure for information and communication, the Internet of Energy, is to be developed, coordinating centralized and decentralized energy generation and transport.

TI  - Design and development desalination procedure to sea water using renewable sources
AB  - The current problem the whole world is facing is the lack of availability of fresh water. The level of ground water is decreasing day by day and there are certain preventive measures taken to prevent this. But this method is not highly efficient. While the concept of water stress is relatively new, it is the difficulty of obtaining sources of fresh water for use during a period of time and may result in further depletion and deterioration of available water resources. Water shortages may be caused by climate change, such as altered weather patterns including droughts or floods, increased pollution, and increasing human demand and overuse of water. A water crisis is a situation where the available portable, unpolluted water within a region is less than that regions demand. Water scarcity is being driven by two phenomena that is growing fresh water use and depletion of usable freshwater resources. Water scarcity can be result of two mechanisms, physical and economic. Where physical water scarcity is a result of inadequate natural water resources to supply a regions demand, and economic water scarcity is a result of poor management of the sufficient available water resources. The proposed system plans to reduce the water scarcity situation by depending on the sea water. The whole world, 97% of the earth is covered with sea water. This can be used a medium rather than depleting the fresh water available. Though the sea water cannot be used directly for specific applications like irrigation, human consumption, etc. The sea water has to undergo desalination process. The proposed system consists of distillation and reverse osmosis as a back to back process so that the treated water can be used for agriculture and drinking activities respectively. The system uses solar-wind energy as a source of supply as it is available abundantly throughout the day. This system will be mobile and standalone unit which can be moved at any point of time to any given location. Â© 2022 Author(s).

TI  - Wind turbine condition monitoring by the approach of SCADA data analysis
AB  - Wind turbines are being increasingly deployed in remote onshore and offshore areas due to the richer wind resource there and the advantages of mitigating the land use and visual impact issues. However, site accessing difficulties and the shortage of proper transportation and installation vehicles/vessels are challenging the operation and maintenance of the giants erected at these remote sites. In addition to the continual pressure on lowering the cost of energy of wind, condition monitoring is being regarded as one of the best solutions for the maintenance issues and therefore is attracting significant interest today. Much effort has been made in developing wind turbine condition monitoring systems and inventing dedicated condition monitoring technologies. However, the high cost and the various capability limitations of available achievements have delayed their extensive use. A cost-effective and reliable wind turbine condition monitoring technique is still sought for today. The purpose of this paper is to develop such a technique through interpreting the SCADA data collected from wind turbines, which have already been collected but have long been ignored due to lack of appropriate data interpretation tools. The major contributions of this paper include: (1) develop an effective method for processing raw SCADA data; (2) propose an alternative condition monitoring technique based on investigating the correlations among relevant SCADA data; and (3) realise the quantitative assessment of the health condition of a turbine under varying operational conditions. Both laboratory and site verification tests have been conducted. It has been shown that the proposed technique not only has a potential powerful capability in detecting incipient wind turbine blade and drive train faults, but also exhibits an amazing ability in tracing their further deterioration.

TI  - High-collapse, cost-effective solid-expandable-monobore systems mitigate subsalt rubble zones
AB  - The reduction of wellbore diameter during well construction has been addressed partially through use of conventional solid-expandable open-hole liners. However, these systems still reduce pass-through diameters and in most cases necessitate significant deviation from the well's basis of design (BOD). For years, end users of solid-expandable liners have needed a simple, cost-effective means of extending casing shoes while maintaining the some well-bore pass-through diameter.

TI  - Flight dynamics and control of a farm of tethered energy systems in a turbulent field
AB  - In this paper, we present a combined flight dynamic, control system, and wake interaction model for an array (farm) oftethered energy systems, assessing the response of the array toa turbulent incoming flow field. The model presented hereinconstitutes the most detailed farm-level dynamic model for tethered energy systems to-date. In particular, the model accountsfor more realistic approximations of tether dynamics and addedmass effects, while characterizing the ability to control the system through both tethers and control surfaces. Focusing on aspecific design and array geometry for ocean current energy harvesting, we analyze the dynamic performance of the array undera turbulent flow field that is representative of the turbulent environment in the Gulf Stream. We perform a frequency domainanalysis of individual tethered systems in order to better understand the attenuation properties of the modeled system. Copyright Â© 2019 ASME.

TI  - Integration of a DFIG-based offshore wind farm and a PMSG-based offshore wind farm connected to a power grid through a VSC-HVDC link
AB  - This paper presents the stability simulation results of an integration of an offshore wind farm (OWF) based on doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) and an OWF based on permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) connected to a large power grid through a high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) link based on voltage-source converter (VSC). These two OWFs are connected to the same AC bus through individual step-up transformers and transmission lines. A damping controller located at the converter station of the proposed VSC-HVDC link is designed by using pole-assignment approach to contribute adequate damping to the studied two OWFs under various operating conditions. A systematic approach using a frequency-domain method and a time-domain scheme is performed to examine the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. It can be concluded from the simulation results that the proposed VSC-HVDC link joined with the designed damping controller located at the converter station can not only render appropriate damping to the modes of the studied OWFs under various operating conditions but also effectively mitigate inherent fluctuations of the power injected to the power grid.

TI  - A fuzzy adaptative backstepping control strategy for marine current turbine under disturbances and uncertainties
AB  - Marine current energy is attracting more and more attention in the world as a reliable and highly predictable energy resource. However, conventional proportional integral (PI) control will be sensitive to the numerous challenges that exist in a marine current turbine system (MCTs) such as marine current disturbance, torque disturbance and other uncertain parameters. This paper proposes a fuzzy adaptive backstepping control (F-A-BC) approach for a marine current turbine system. The proposed F-A-BC strategy consisted of two parts. First, an adaptive backstepping control approach with the compensation of disturbance and uncertainty was designed to improve anti-interference of the MCT so that the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) was realized. Then, a fuzzy logic control approach was combined to adjust parameters of an adaptive backstepping control approach in real time. The effectiveness of the proposed controller was verified by the simulation of a direct-drive marine current turbine system. The simulation results showed that the F-A-BC has better anti-interference ability and faster convergence compared to the adaptive backstepping control, sliding mode control and fuzzy PI control strategies under disturbances. The error percentage of rotor speed could be reduced by 3.5% under swell effect compared to the conventional controller. Moreover, the robustness of the F-A-BC method under uncertainties was tested and analyzed. The simulation results also indicated that the proposed approach could slightly improve the power extraction capability of the MCTs under variable marine current speed. Â© 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Results using Azipod propulsion in ice management operations
AB  - A major part of world's oil and gas reserves are located in Arctic and Subarctic seas, such as Sakhalin fields in Okthosk Sea as well in Chuchki Sea, Beaufort Sea Alaska. Year around operations in these areas results increasing need for special designed icebreaking offshore support vessels and tankers. Important characteristic of these vessels is the capability in ice managent duties. Azimuth thruster offers great flexibility in different ice management using the thruster wake and propeller close contact with ice. Electric propulsion with Azipod propulsors has been used in such vessels with good success for many years and the system itself has shown to be reliable and very good characteristics when operated in ice. In Sakhalin region there has accumulated experience from 7 icebreaking vessels with ABB electric propulsion many equipped with Azipods. Recently two new icebreaking vessels with Azipod have been built for Arkutun-Dagi field. Electric Azipod propulsion system have been playing an important part in several arctic ship projects making the demanding projects technically and economically feasible. In this paper will be presented characteristics as well some full-scle test results where Azipod units are used in ice management type operations. Azimuth propulsion offers improved ice management performance and greater flexibility for the vessel design. Presented tests results will give further insight of different possibilities e.g. selection of most suitable azimuthing angles for various tasks. Copyright 2014. Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Preliminary performance assessment of a novel on-shore system recovering energy from tidal currents
AB  - An innovative system for recovering energy from tidal currents is proposed. The system is composed of a blade immersed in sea water and connected to a vertical bar which, moving up and down under the action of the sea current, transfers energy to a double effect pump. The latter feeds a pressurized reservoir providing a water flow rate, at suitable pressure, to a hydraulic turbine. The basic configuration involves a four-bar linkage connecting the vertical bar and the piston pump. The system can be employed in all the sites whose seabed quickly deepens and whose tidal currents are parallel to the coast. In this paper, the authors provide a methodology for designing the system, once found the bathymetry of the chosen site and the field of variation of the tidal current velocities, taking into account the morphology of the costal boundary layer. A case study, developed for the Calabrian site of Punta Pezzo (Strait of Messina â€“ Italy), demonstrated the technical feasibility. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Regional CO2 solubility trapping potential of a deep saline aquifer in Pohang basin, Korea
AB  - This paper presents regional CO2 solubility trapping potential for stable CO2 storage as immobile phase and decomposed form while CO2 migrates through flow pathways characterized by the geological structure of an aquifer in Pohang basin, SE offshore Korea. The saline aquifer in Pohang basin has been selected as a target formation for geologic carbon storage due to favorable geologic structures and sedimentary strata defined through seismic survey. The aquifer is confined by southeast and northwest faults, and structure is unconfined and sloping toward the northeast direction. The main target within the aquifer to store CO2 contains west plunging anticlines. In order to enlarge contact area of CO2 with brine and improve injectivity, the CO2 injector is located on marginal anticlines or small synclines. This structure may significantly affect CO2 flow dynamics through upward migration pathways within the aquifer. We, in this area, provide estimates for CO2 solubility trapping affected by dynamic CO2 migration pathways and present different types of CO2 trapping potentials. The numerical results based on thermodynamic equilibrium equation provide regional CO2 solubility trapping potential which has a linear relationship with brine salinity. We suggest that dynamic migration pathways resulting from geological structure are significantly important to increase CO2 solubility trapping potential in geological storage of CO2.

TI  - A linearized model for estimating the performance of submerged resonant wave energy converters
AB  - A realistic performance analysis of oscillating water column wave energy converters (WECs) addresses to a set of non-linear differential equations that need to be integrated in time, by using a stochastic approach, under the hypothesis of random wind-generated sea waves, for all the sea states which characterize the location of the system. Non-linearities of the differential equations have several origins: â€¢minor and major losses of the unsteady flow of water and air;â€¢compressibility of air and heat exchange with the walls of the air chamber;â€¢non-linear characteristics of the turbine. Under the hypothesis of random sea waves with Gaussian distribution, the authors propose an original methodology for linearizing the differential equations that describe the flow motion inside a wholly submerged WEC. Under such hypothesis, the linearized model can be used for predicting the power output by means of the calculations in the frequency domain and for control design. The developed methodology has been applied to the estimation of the performance of the new "resonant sea wave energy converters", called REWEC, patented by Boccotti in 1998, and consisting of several caissons, characterized by a structure similar to the caissons of the traditional breakwaters and placed on the seabed, close one to each other, to form a submerged breakwater. Each caisson is connected to a vertical duct wholly beneath the sea level, where a hydraulic Wells turbine is placed. The matching between turbine and resonance characteristic of the system is carefully analysed in order to maximize the energy conversion efficiency. Some results, given for a small installation in the Mediterranean sea, confirm that the REWEC system is able to absorb a large share of the incident wave energy due to a very simple regulation system which permits the tuning on sea states with different significant heights.

TI  - Hydrodynamic performance of a dual-floater hybrid system combining a floating breakwater and an oscillating-buoy type wave energy converter
AB  - The high cost of power generation impedes commercial-scale wave power operations. The objective of this work is to provide a cost-sharing solution by combining wave energy extraction and coastal protection. A two-dimensional numerical wave tank was developed using Star-CCM+ Computational Fluid Dynamics software to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of a dual-floater hybrid system consisting of a floating breakwater and an oscillating-buoy type wave energy converter (WEC), and was compared with published experimental results. The differences between the hydrodynamic performance of the hybrid system, a single WEC and a single breakwater were compared. Wave resonance in the WEC-breakwater gap has a significant impact on system performance, with the hybrid system demonstrating both better wave attenuation and wave energy extraction capabilities at low wave frequencies, i.e., wider effective frequency. Forces on the breakwater were generally reduced due to the WEC. Wave resonance in the narrow gap has an adverse effect on the energy efficiency of the hybrid system with an asymmetric WEC, while a beneficial effect with a symmetric WEC. The wave energy conversion efficiency of hybrid system can be improved by increasing the draft and width of the WEC and decreasing the distance between the WEC and the breakwater. The findings of this paper make wave energy economically competitive and commercial-scale wave power operations possible.

TI  - Variable gas solubility effect of the gas hydrate system and its influence on optimization of gas recovery
AB  - Methane solubility in water is significantly lower in the presence of hydrate than in water where no hydrate is present. Experiments with hydrate present show a decrease in gas solubility with both decreasing temperature and increasing pressure when crystalline hydrate is introduced. The water around hydrate becomes supersaturated in methane and subsequently promotes additional hydrate formation without exsolution of free gas. Thus, heating of the water and gas produced from hydrate is recommended to insure the absence of unwanted hydrate formation and optimize flow assurance. Â© 2003, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - Satellite data for high resolution offshore wind resource mapping: A data fusion approach
AB  - Wind resource mapping needs accurate high spatial and temporal resolutions wind measurements. Offshore, satellite data are an accurate and economic way to access wind measurements. Previous studies showed the capabilities of some remote sensing instruments to measure the wind. Synthetic aperture radars (SAR) have a high spatial resolution but are associated to a low temporal repetitiveness, preventing resource assessment reliability due to the small number of samples. Scatterometers have a sufficient temporal repetitiveness for assessment reliability but have a low spatial resolution (25 km). In this paper we apply a data fusion method to these different datasets. The fusion of scatterometer and SAR data sets results on a synthetic data set having the high spatial resolution of SAR measurements and the temporal repetitiveness of scatterometer measurements. This synthetic data set, having high spatial resolution, can be used to assess the resource at a high spatial resolution. It meets the requirements of the computation of wind statistics.

TI  - Upstream: News: Breakthrough in tidal technology
AB  - A revolutionary breakthrough in tidal technology, with a system that uses the tidal stream in conjunction with the natural rise and fall of the tide to create electricity, has been developed by engineers at Hi-Spec Research and Developments of Fowey. The offshore Ocean Hydro Electricity Generator (OHEG) power plant allows electricity to be generated from the sea, around the block. Based on the use of tidal and chamber turbines, combined with energy accumulators, energy is created through the natural tidal stream and the rise and fall of the tide, a more reliable energy source than wind or solar technologies. The offshore OHEG structure would consist of three rows of chambers and two outer walls, creating four channels, with the tidal stream then diverted through these channels. The OHEG plant holds back over 6 million ton of water every 6.5 hr and, in doing so, creates power through the chamber turbines.

TI  - Design and Analysis of an Improved Artificial Neural Network Controller for the Energy Efficiency Enhancement of Wind Power Plant
AB  - Globally, Renewable Energy Resources (RER) are playing a vital role in generating the electrical energy due to the conventional fossil fuel-based power plants which are harming the environment. Also, the availability of fossil fuels is going to run out. The primary resources for RER are sun, wind, hydro, and tidal. Among energy, the harnessing rate has been rapidly increased in solar Photovoltaic (PV) and wind power plants. Since sun and wind energy are abundant in nature, nevertheless, natural resources are seasonal which are varying concerning the climatic condition. Therefore, sun and wind power generators are produced fluctuating electrical energy which causes stability issues. It can be compensated by the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) technique. At present, the MPPT technique is incorporated with RER for generating maximum electrical energy based on available resources. In this manuscript, a wind power plant with an Improved Variable Step-Radial Basis Functional Network (IVS-RBFN)-based MPPT model has been developed by using MATLAB/Simulink window to analyze the significance of MPPT. The simulation results show that wind power plants are capable of generating constant power with the help of IVS-RBFN-based MPPT technique. Furthermore, the wind power output is significantly enhanced with the accurately designed boost converter. Â© 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

TI  - The state of the art in monitoring and verification-Ten years on
AB  - In the ten years since publication of the IPCC Special Report on CCS, there has been considerable progress in monitoring and verification (M\&V). Numerous injection projects, ranging from small injection pilots to much larger longer-term commercial operations, have been successfully monitored to the satisfaction of regulatory agencies, and technologies have been adapted and implemented to demonstrate containment, conformance, and no environmental impact. In this review we consider M\&V chiefly from the perspective of its ability to satisfy stakeholders that these three key requirements are being met. From selected project examples, we show how this was done, and reflect particularly on the nature of the verification process. It is clear that deep-focussed monitoring will deliver the primary requirement to demonstrate conformance and containment and to provide early warning of any deviations from predicted storage behaviour. Progress in seismic imaging, especially offshore, and the remarkable results with InSAR from In Salah are highlights of the past decade. A wide range of shallow monitoring techniques has been tested at many sites, focussing especially on the monitoring of soil gas and groundwater. Quantification of any detected emissions would be required in some jurisdictions to satisfy carbon mitigation targets in the event of leakage to surface: however, given the likely high security of foreseeable storage sites, we suggest that shallow monitoring should focus mainly on assuring against environmental impacts. This reflects the low risk profile of well selected and well operated storage sites and recognizes the over-arching need for monitoring to be directed to specific, measureable risks. In particular, regulatory compliance might usefully involve clearer articulation of leakage scenarios, with this specificity making it possible to demonstrate ``no leakage{''} in a more objective way than is currently the case. We also consider the monitoring issues for CO2-EOR, and argue that there are few technical problems in providing assurance that EOR sites are successfully sequestering CO2; the issues lie largely in linking existing oil and gas regulations to new greenhouse gas policy. We foresee that, overall, monitoring technologies will continue to benefit from synergies with oil and gas operations, but that the distinctive regulatory and certification environments for CCS may pose new questions. Overall, while there is clearly scope for technical improvements, more clearly posed requirements, and better communication of monitoring results, we reiterate that this has been a decade of significant achievement that leaves monitoring and verification well placed to serve the wider CCS enterprise.

TI  - The Use of Living Mussels as a Substratum for Growing Seedlings of Two Sargassum Species from the Perspective of Coastal Seaweed Bed Restoration in the East China Sea
AB  - Sargassum vachellianum and Sargassum horneri are the main dominant species and primary producers of seaweed beds in Chinese coastal ecosystems that play an important role in marine blue carbon sinks. However, due to the influence of frequent human activities and global climate change, the seaweed beds formed by Sargassum vachellianum and Sargassum horneri in Chinese coastal waters are gradually declining. In this study, Sargassum zygotes were cultured onto the surface of mussels and then used to repair the declining seaweed bed resources through seaweed transplantation, which was indirectly achieved based on the fast attachment of mussel byssus. The results show that zygotes of Sargassum vachellianum and Sargassum horneri could grow on the surface of mussels and, over time, the force and rate of mussel adhesion gradually increased. The adhesion of Mytilus coruscus was greater than that of Septifer virgatus mussels. After four hours, the rate of adhesion for Mytilus coruscus with a shell length of 30 mm was 100\%, and the adhesion force was the highest, at 0.511 +/- 0.099 N. Hence, Mytilus coruscus showed better adhesion than Septifer virgatus. After 41 days, the mean length of Sargassum horneri germlings on the surface of Mytilus coruscus grew to 5.554 +/- 0.724 mm, the daily growth rate was about 0.154 mm/d, and the mean density declined by 50.59\%. After 31 days, the mean length of Sargassum vachellianum germlings increased to 5.510 +/- 0.763 mm, the daily growth rate was about 0.191 mm/d, and the mean density declined by 21.21\%. After 2 months of development of the mussel-seaweed combinations in coastal waters, the survival rate of Sargassum horneri was 7.6 +/- 0.9\% and that of Sargassum vachellianum was 25.9 +/- 10.5\%. Hence, compared with Sargassum horneri, Sargassum vachellianum attached to Mytilus coruscus showed better development, and this system can be used to combat the decline in seaweed bed resources. In this method, mussels were used as an intermediate attachment medium to indirectly achieve the settlement of zygotes for seaweed transplantation, and, therefore, their use as a substratum serves as the basis for a novel technique for seaweed beds restoration.

TI  - Dynamic Simulation and Analysis of Slug Flow Impact on Offshore Natural Gas Processing: TEG Dehydration, Joule-Thomson Expansion and Membrane Separation
AB  - Crude natural gas (NG) can contain a significant amount of contaminants that must be removed to guarantee safe transportation and sales specification. Water and hydrocarbon dew point (WDP and HCDP) adjustments are important for conditioning NG. In Brazil, Pre-Salt reservoirs have large amounts of NG with high CO2 content, which also must be adjusted by a suitable operation like Membrane Permeation (MP). Furthermore, offshore processing requires reduced footprints, which minimize inventories and, consequently, intensify propagation of feed disturbances to downstream units. The dynamic scenario is inherently related to riser oscillations caused by slug flow, that may cause operational problems, losses and environmental and safety issues. Hence, the process control system must be sufficiently robust to ensure stability within such context. This work approaches the dynamical analysis of an offshore NG treating process for a typical Pre-Salt feed with the following operations: phase separation, dehydration with triethylene glycol (TEG) absorption, HCDP adjustment via Joule-Thomson (JT) expansion and CO2 removal via MP. The objective is to assess the dynamic behaviour of the process and its control framework under slug flow oscillations within HYSYS simulation environment. As MP is not included in the simulator unit library, a dynamic unit operation extension (UOE-D) was developed. This UOE-D extension adequately reproduces MP response to disturbances allowing the entire process to be dynamically assessed. In general, results point to good process controllability and overall robustness despite the severe slug flow feed oscillations.

TI  - Elevated carbon dioxide and reduced salinity enhance mangrove seedling establishment in an artificial saltmarsh community
AB  - The global phenomenon of mangrove encroachment into saltmarshes has been observed across five continents. It has been proposed that this encroachment is driven in part by rising atmospheric CO2 concentration and reduced salinity in saltmarshes resulting from rising sea levels enhancing the establishment success of mangrove seedlings. However, this theory is yet to be empirically tested at the community-level. In this study, we examined the effect of CO2 and salinity on seedling growth of two mangrove species, Aegiceras corniculatum and Avicennia marina, grown individually and in a model saltmarsh community in a glasshouse experiment. We found that the shoot (210\%) and root (91\%) biomass of the saltmarsh species was significantly greater under elevated CO2. As a result, both mangrove species experienced a stronger competitive effect from the saltmarsh species under elevated CO2. Nevertheless, A. marina seedlings produced on average 48\% more biomass under elevated CO2 when grown in competition with the saltmarsh species. The seedlings tended to allocate this additional biomass to growing taller suggesting they were light limited. In contrast, A. corniculatum growth did not significantly differ between CO2 treatments. However, it had on average 36\% greater growth under seawater salinity compared to hypersaline conditions. Avicennia marina seedlings were not affected by salinity. From these results, we suggest that although CO2 and salinity are not universal drivers determining saltmarsh-mangrove boundaries, it is likely that rising atmospheric CO2 concentration and reduced salinity associated with sea level rise will enhance the establishment success of mangrove seedlings in saltmarshes, which may facilitate mangrove encroachment in the future.

TI  - A novel baseline model based technique for condition monitoring of wind turbine components
AB  - The operating conditions of wind turbine components have been monitored by fitting acoustic emission (AE) and vibration sensors inside wind turbines and analysing sensor measurements using appropriate signal processing techniques. However, there is still no systematic approach which can take the operating parameters of wind turbines into account when analysing the sensor measurements for condition monitoring purposes. The operating parameters of wind turbines such as, for example, wind speed, wind direction and turbine power output, etc. often have a significant effect on the measured AE and vibration signals. Therefore there is a need to develop an effective technique which can systematically consider the effect of these wind turbine operating parameters on the features of measured AE and/or vibration signals. Consequently, any change in the signal features which are literally produced by abnormality of turbine components and/or system can be correctly identified. Motivated by this objective, in the present study, we propose a novel baseline model based technique for condition monitoring of wind turbine components. The idea is to establish a baseline model for an operating wind turbine which represents the relationship between the wind speed, turbine power output, etc. turbine operating parameters and the appropriate features of correspondingly measured vibration and/or AE signals. Given a specific working condition, the model output can be regarded as the baseline features of measured AE and/or vibration signals. Therefore, any significant deviation of practically measured AE and vibration signal features from the baseline can be explained to be due to some kind of abnormality inside turbine components and/or system. Consequently, the information can be effectively used to achieve the objective of condition monitoring, even fault diagnosis. The application of the proposed method to the real AE, vibration and turbine operating parameter (wind speed and power output) data collected from an operating wind turbine is described in the paper. The results verify the effectiveness of the new approach and demonstrate its potential to address complicated offshore wind turbine condition monitoring problems.

TI  - Planning at the edge: Integrating across the land sea divide
AB  - Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) is a relatively recent phenomenon. Land planning has evolved through decades of hard experience. This paper considers the origins of both marine and terrestrial planning highlighting fundamental differences. Development projects combining marine and terrestrial infrastructure, but operating in separate planning regimes, create the potential for conflict. With rising ambition to exploit marine resources there is a growing need for effective coordination between the terrestrial and marine planning systems. This paper considers marine renewable energy (wave and tide) developments which clearly represent and magnify the issues involved. Dense arrays of devices in close proximity to shore, combined marine/terrestrial operations, and coastal protected areas expose choices to high public scrutiny and introduce risk to developers. Particular reference is made to Scotland and marine renewable energy (MRE) development in the Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters (PFOW). The PFOW area is the world centre for trials of MRE devices and the subject of preparatory work and testing for MSP in all of Scottish waters. Scotland has the fourth largest marine area in Europe. This paper concludes that full integration is not achievable. The differences in governance, rights and resource use are too great. However, transboundary interactions are very significant and demand a high level of coordination and clear lines of accountability. Separation of accountability between central government responsibility for marine planning and local responsibility for terrestrial planning is not sustainable. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Performance evaluation of dynamic HV cables with Al conductors for floating offshore wind turbines
AB  - Floating Offshore Wind turbine installations will require HV dynamic power cables to be connected to the of longer length static export power cables. Experience from offshore wind installations has highlighted the criticality of power cables, underlining the need for high integrity, yet cost effective cable solutions. This paper will assess the mechanical performance and load parameters for an Aluminum power conductor cable. Whilst copper is the conventional choice due to its lower resistive losses, Aluminum cores are increasingly used for static power cables, due to their benefits regarding overall cable weight and material cost. The work presented adopts a coupled aero-elastic and hydrodynamic modelling approach to simulate the behavior of the well-documented OC4 semi-sub platform, together with the 5MW NREL wind turbine. The model allows a direct comparison between the two cable types, maintaining the overall system and environmental conditions. The results inform the design envelope regarding the ultimate load conditions a for the two principle cable designs, providing global load estimates, such as effective tension and bending stresses, to inform the local stress analysis. Furthermore, the results will form the basis for future physical demonstration and validation tests. This paper will be of interest to technology developers and practitioners concerned with submarine dynamic power cables, offer a methodology to directly compare and evaluate different cable design options, and providing some design guidance for and aluminum conductor cables.
