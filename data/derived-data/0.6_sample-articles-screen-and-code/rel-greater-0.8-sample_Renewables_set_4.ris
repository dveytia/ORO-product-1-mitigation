TI  - Blue urbanism: Exploring connections between cities and oceans
AB  - What would it mean to live in cities designed to foster feelings of connectedness to the ocean? As coastal cities begin planning for climate change and rising sea levels, author Timothy Beatley sees opportunities for rethinking the relationship between urban development and the ocean. Modern society is more dependent upon ocean resources than people are commonly aware of, from oil and gas extraction to wind energy, to the vast amounts of fish harvested globally, to medicinal compounds derived from sea creatures, and more. In Blue Urbanism, Beatley argues that, given all we've gained from the sea, city policies, plans, and daily urban life should acknowledge and support a healthy ocean environment. The book explores issues ranging from urban design and land use, to resource extraction and renewable energy, to educating urbanites about the wonders of marine life. Beatley looks at how emerging practices like "community supported fisheries" and aquaponics can provide a sustainable alternative to industrial fishing practices.Other chapters delve into incentives for increasing use of wind and tidal energy as renewable options to oil and gas extraction that damages ocean life, and how the shipping industry is becoming more "green." Additionally, urban citizens, he explains, have many opportunities to interact meaningfully with the ocean, from beach cleanups to helping scientists gather data. Ultimately, he explains that we must create a culture of "ocean literacy" using a variety of approaches, from building design and art installations that draw inspiration from marine forms, to encouraging citizen volunteerism related to oceans, to city-sponsored research, and support for new laws that protect marine health. Equal parts inspiration and practical advice for urban planners, ocean activists, and policymakers, Blue Urbanism offers a comprehensive look at the challenges and great potential for urban areas to integrate ocean health into their policy and planning goals.

TI  - An off-grid stand-alone wave energy supply system with maximum power extraction scheme for green energy utilization in Malaysian Island
AB  - Energy is one of the most important factors in the socioeconomic development of a country. In a developing country like Malaysia, the development of islands is mostly related to the availability of electric power. As an island surrounded by sea, power generated by wave energy source will become one of the most promising solutions for the electrification of island areas. But, the unpredictable nature of the wave energy source is the main drawback. This paper presents a novel stand-alone wave energy supply system modeling with maximum power tracking and an energy storage-based power management algorithm in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The main contributions of this research work are eliminating the intermittent power generation nature of wave energy and efficiently extract the maximum wave power. In the proposed stand-alone system, a DC-DC bidirectional buck-boost converter controller is used to maintain the constant dc-link voltage. It also accumulates the surplus wave power in the battery bank and supplies this power to the load during the wave power shortage. A three-phase complex vector control scheme voltage source inverter is used to control the load-side voltage in terms of the frequency and voltage amplitude. Based on the simulation results obtained from MATLAB/Simulink, it has been found that the overall system is capable of working under variable weather and load conditions, and it can also able to extract the maximum wave power.

TI  - Synthesis of life support nanotechnologies into a replicable autonomous engineering system of an individual dwelling house
AB  - Introduction. Currently, one can witness a boom of renewable energy in foreign countries: zones with earth, coastal and even offshore wind power plants are emerging, and the roofs of houses, hotels, schools and hospitals are being ``dressed{''} by solar batteries and by panels to generate electricity and water. At the same time, despite the fact that these installations are unreliable and rare sources, many experts and politicians begin to mistakenly consider them as the basic ones. All that poses a scientific and technical problem of determining the place of nature-like technologies in the structure of life support systems of the population. Methods, models and tools. The paper analyzes the engineering systems of multi-apartment residential buildings and individual residential buildings that deliver life support resources (electricity, gas, cold and hot water, etc.). But one should also note that the engineering systems often keep potential fire- energy and environmental harm. To resolve the mentioned problems, some nanotechnologies and Russian patents concerning autonomous electricity, water, heat supply of individual residential buildings on them were proposed. Results and discussion. Modeling has shown that the combination of ``Shukhovskaya{''} and vortex wind turbines with domestic hydraulic panels and solar panels makes it possible to create duplicated and tripled engineering systems of individual residential buildings, which, in terms of quality, reliability and safety parameters, are several orders of magnitude higher than the existing centralized resource supply systems for the residential sector of cities and rural settlements. Conclusion. The proposed approach makes it possible to determine the place of the so-called renewable energy in the structure of the resource supply system for cities and rural settlements, and it remains to assess its effectiveness, which is supposed to be done using the Leontiev-Ford model and the retro-forecasting method.

TI  - A Methodology to Analyse the Impact of Offshore Wind Forecasting Error on Electricity Markets
AB  - Currently wind power is dominated by onshore wind farms in the British Isles, but both the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland have high renewable energy targets, expected to come mostly from wind power. However, as the demand for wind power grows to ensure security of energy supply, as a potentially cheaper alternative to fossil fuels and to meet greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets offshore wind power will grow rapidly as the availability of suitable onshore sites decrease. However, wind is variable and stochastic by nature and thus difficult to schedule. In order to plan for these uncertainties market operators use wind forecasting tools, reserve plant and ancillary service agreements. Onshore wind power forecasting techniques have improved dramatically and continue to advance, but offshore wind power forecasting is more difficult due to limited datasets and knowledge. So as the amount of offshore wind power increases in the British Isles robust forecasting and planning techniques are even more critical. This paper presents a methodology to investigate the impacts of better offshore wind forecasting on the operation and management of the single wholesale electricity market in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland using PLEXOS for Power Systems.

TI  - Wave energy resource characterization and assessment for coastal waters of the United States
AB  - The wave energy resource is characterized and assessed for coastal waters of the United States to evaluate regional opportunities and constraints for wave energy converter (WEC) projects. Partitioned wave parameters generated from a 30-year WaveWatch III model hindcast are used to estimate the total wave energy potential as an annual available energy (AAE), which is a theoretical annual energy production per unit energy capture length without considering energy conversion losses. The distribution of AAE by peak period, wave direction, month, and year is quantified using summary statistics, including peak period spread, AAE-weighted period, AAE-directionality coefficient, and inter-annual and seasonal temporal variability. Geographical distributions of the AAE and these five resource attributes delineate distinct wave energy resource regions within United States coastal waters, where different opportunities and constraints may influence regional energy planning, WEC project development, and WEC conceptual design.

TI  - Wave attenuation and focusing performance of parallel twin parabolic arc floating breakwaters
AB  - The hybrid system consisting of floating breakwater and point absorber wave energy converters provides a promising solution for shoreline protection and wave power generation. In the hybrid system, the breakwater plays an important role in protecting the sheltered area on the lee side and focusing high waves for better energy harvesting on the weather side. To improve the wave attenuation and focusing performance, a twin-breakwater consisting of a pair of parallel parabolic pontoons is proposed. Based on the potential flow theory of linear waves, the influences of gap width and connection method applied between the two pontoons are studied in the frequency domain, with an emphasis on the so-called critical mode around which both wave attenuation and focusing could be improved. Results show that the rigidly connected twin-breakwater is superior to the unconnected twin-breakwater with the same configuration in both wave attenuation and focusing. A second critical mode with lower frequency is also found under particular gap width, providing a potential for the defense of long waves. An optimal attenuation could be obtained by applying a proper gap width. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Numerical and experimental study on hydrodynamic performance of multi-level OWEC
AB  - The performance of a multi-level overtopping wave energy converter (OWEC) has been numerically and experimentally investigated in a two-dimensional wave tank in order to study the effects of opening width of additional reservoirs. The device is a fixed OWEC consisting of an inclined ramp together with several reservoirs at different levels. A particle-based numerical simulation utilizing the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is used to simulate the flow behavior around the OWEC. Additionally, an experimental model is also built and tested in a small wave flume in order to validate the numerical results. A comparison in energy captured performance between single-level and multi-level devices has been proposed using the hydraulic efficiency. The enhancement of power capture performance is accomplished by increasing an overtopping flow rate captured by the extra reservoirs. However, a noticeably large opening of the extra reservoirs can result in a reduction in the power efficiency. The overtopping flow behavior into the reservoirs is also presented and discussed. Moreover, the results of hydrodynamic performance are compared with a similar study, of which a similar tendency is achieved. Nevertheless, the LBM simulations consume less computational time in both pre-processing and calculating phases.

TI  - Dynamic simulation of flow field under horizontal tidal turbine
AB  - A novel simulation method was searched to simulate the interaction between tidal turbines and flow field in a large area. A robust turbine model was proposed and then integrated into a finite difference method code. The improved model was used to simulate a flume experiment of tidal turbines in laboratory and comparisons were made between simulations and measurements. The results showed that the coupled model can predict correctly the flow field beyond approximate 5 diameters downstream of the rotors. Â© 2016, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - To analyze the structural loads at the blade root and tower of a wind turbine, in this study, we used an aerodynamic-hydrodynamic coupled analysis model to simulate the one-degree-of-freedom motion response of an offshore wind turbine in unsteady wind and regular wave conditions. We also compared and analyzed the influences of three longitudinal motions on the structural loads of the blade and tower. The results show that the motion response dramatically increases the structural loads of the wind turbine, Therefore, reducing the structural loads at the blade root and tower should become an important design requirement. This paper reveals the influence of motion on the structural loads of the offshore floating wind turbine and provides direction for optimizing the design of a larger megawatt-level floating wind turbine system.

AB  - The potential for generating electricity from tidal currents are massive it is a resource that is exploited for sustainable generation of electricity. High load operator creating from fluid characteristics and expectable resource properties making marine currents, especially, attractive for power obstetrics and useful matched to the other renewable energies. Furthermore, international conventions concerning climate controlled to the re-emergence of renewable energy technology in the oceans.

TI  - Capacitive sensors for offshore scour monitoring
AB  - One of the main challenges in the design and operation of offshore wind turbines arises from the uncertainty about maximum scour depth around their foundations. Scour action can lead to excessive excavation of the surrounding seabed and is being considered as a major risk for offshore wind farm developments. An ability to gather information concerning the evolution of scouring will enable the validation of models derived from laboratory-based studies, the assessment of different engineering designs and the development of improved scour countermeasure techniques. However, real-time scour data are not being collected due to a lack of available instrumentation techniques. This paper proposes a new scour monitoring technology for offshore wind turbine installations. The monitoring system consists of arrays of small capacitive scour probes installed around the foundation structure and linked to a wireless network to enable remote data acquisition. Based on this research, it is concluded that the sensor is capable of exhibiting high sensitivity to scour and sediment deposition processes for common sea floor mediums under different temperature conditions in saline water. The proposed monitoring system has considerable potential for field applications that will contribute to improving the resilience and sustainability of offshore structures.

TI  - Assessment of Tidal Current Energy Potential at Uldolmok in the Southwestern Coast of Korea
AB  - Quantitative assessment for the tidal current energy potential and marine conditions should be preceded to construct the optimal tidal energy farm. Assessment of tidal energy resource at Uldolmok which is the optimal candidate sites for tidal energy farm was carried out. In order to collect the field data, static survey using ADCP(Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) was conducted and harmonic analysis was done to predict the annual tidal current. As a result, the dominant direction of ebb current was southeast and flood current was northwest. The maximum ebb current speed was about 4.09 m/s. While, annual power density was estimated as 56.78MWh/m. 1MW(HS 1000), 1.2MW(MCT 1200), 1.5MW(AR 1500), 2MW(SeaGen-S 2000) that were commercially available turbines in the world were used to calculate the annual energy production. SeaGen-S was possible to produce the highest annual energy production up to 9,338.4MWh. These results can be used to establish a plan for the development of the tidal current energy farm.

TI  - Layouts for ocean wave energy farms: Models, properties, and optimization
AB  - Renewable energy, such as wave energy, plays a significant role in sustainable energy development. Wave energy represents a large untapped source of energy worldwide and potentially offers a vast source of sustainable energy. We present models and a heuristic algorithm for choosing optimal locations of wave energy conversion (WEC) devices within an array, or wave farm. The location problem can have a significant impact on the total power of the farm due to the interactions among the incident ocean waves and the scattered and radiated waves produced by the WECs. Depending on the nature of the interference (constructive or destructive) among these waves, the wave energy entering multiple devices, and thus the power output of the farm, may be significantly larger or smaller than the energy that would be seen if the devices were operating in isolation. Our algorithm chooses WEC locations to maximize the performance of a wave farm as measured by a well known performance measure called the q-factor, which is the ratio of the power from an array of N WECs to the power from N WECs operating independently, under the point absorber approximation. We prove an analytical optimal solution for the 2-WEC problem and, based on the properties of the 2-WEC solution, we propose an iterative heuristic optimization algorithm for the general problem.

TI  - Dynamic Phasor-based Stability Analysis of Multi-Terminal VSC-HVDC Links with Offshore AC Networks
AB  - The paper proposes the stability analysis of an offshore wind power plant connected to an onshore AC grid through high voltage AC (HVAC) and multi-terminal high voltage DC (MTDC) transmission systems. Dynamic phasor (DP) technique is used to derive the small-signal model of the entire system and to analyze the system with sufficient accuracy and relatively lower computation cost. The DP modeling accounts for the voltage source converter (VSC) models, inner current controller, outer voltage controller, and droop controllers. The impact of the variation of the frequency droop gain, voltage droop gain and line inductance values on the system stability is studied by performing an eigenvalue analysis of the combined system. Simulations in MATLAB/Simulink are used to validate the DP-based analysis of VSC-HVDC systems for offshore wind farm applications. Â© 2018 IEEE.

TI  - Modelling small-scale stand-alone (PV) energy systems with Reverse Osmosis integration
AB  - Australia has a vast land mass characterised by more than 35,000km of shore-line and an abundance of renewable sources (e.g., solar and wind energy). Despite the existence of much potential to utilise sustainable pathways of power generation, there remains a general reliance on electricity generated from larger plants which are mostly grid-connected but fossil-fuel operated. In Western Australia, only a fraction of its coastal areas and inland mass is serviced by the South West Interconnected (grid) System. For the majority of its regional communities, decentralised power generation forms the prime source of power provision. This exacerbates the situation with regard to accessing electricity due to the elevated cost of obtaining fuel (for power generation) as well as reliance on smaller, less-efficient, generator sets. For many small (remote) or coastal communities' access to potable water is limited alongside good availability of renewable energies. This provides opportunity for utilising renewably powered stand-alone energy systems to help deliver the power needed to directly run utilities, operate desalination systems and reduce the associated emissions footprint. This investigation uses modelling to analyse the performance of small-scale stand-alone (energy) systems incorporating Reverse Osmosis (RO), providing up to 15litres/day potable water. Through inclusion of physical models representing different hardware components in a Solar-Photovoltaic (PV) system, this research provides an insight into the interaction between the availability of solar energy, energy conversion into DC electric power via PV panels, power conditioning (DC to AC), battery charging/discharging and the power needed for desalination. This paper not only highlights a modelling methodology for such systems but also demonstrates how individual (system) components may be characterised and seasonal variations (of solar irradiance, localised wind speed and ambient temperature) included in the simulations. Simulations undertaken include consideration for unit quantities (solar irradiance per square metre and temporal resolution of predicted irradiance to 1hour). Such approaches provide a basis for future studies into energy system scalability, energy efficiency in small-scale (stand-alone, renewably powered) desalination systems as well as the deployment of other (non-battery) energy storage media to increase renewable energy utilisation. Modelling yields solar irradiance predictions which are compared to measured data at locations typical of Perth, West Australia. The models also accommodate considerations for the effects of localised wind speed and ambient temperature on predicted PV panel performance. This yields more accurate conversion characteristics of PV and helps provide better resolved (dynamic) renewable energy (input) data for the simulations. Laboratory based experiments are used to verify the efficiency, water recovery ratio and power characteristics of RO as well as other energy system components. Simulations undertaken using MATLAB help analyse the energy system over a yearly period. Results allow predictions of total (renewable) energy availability, excess (renewable) energy (not captured due to battery capacity) and total potable water production (under two different amounts of daily water demand). Outcomes are discussed with regard to the benefits of incorporating more advanced predictive modelling methodologies and alternate means of (batteryfree) energy storage for stand-alone PV energy systems.

The OWC-WEC is situated over a uniform bed. To model the irregular incoming waves, the Piersonâ€“Moskowitz spectrum with two most probable sea states is considered. To solve the problem, the boundary element method (BEM) is used. To study the efficiency of the L-shaped duct OWC device, free surface elevations outside, and within the device chamber, the average efficiency of the device are plotted as a function of the turbine damping coefficient. Moreover, the effects of chamber length, submergence depth, front wall protrusion length, and thickness of the OWC device on the performances are analyzed.

AB  - This paper is concerned with the development of a fatigue life prediction methodology for ocean energy structures. To this end, a programme of fatigue testing of glass fibre reinforced laminates is employed to characterise the strain-life behaviour of two candidate material combinations. The test specimens are made from quasi-isotropic laminates of both vinyl ester and epoxy matrices. A preliminary finite element model of a tidal turbine blade is developed to identify the relevant stresses and strains under representative hydrodynamic loading. The hydrodynamic (blade) loads are calculated using a stream tube momentum model, based on tidal current velocities predicted by a sinusoidal equation. The comparative behaviour of the candidate materials is assessed in the context of the turbine blade model. Copyright Â© 2011 by ASME.

TI  - Possibilities and boundaries of wave power plants [Moglichkeiten und Grenzen von Wellenkraftwerken]
AB  - The various systems of wave energy conversion are discussed with the aid of available literature. This has led to closure of almost all research and development work on such plants. The emphasis has shifted to onshore systems, accepting the disadvantage of lower energy potential. Further, it can be noted that the date the "simplest' systems have been the most "successful'. Larger plants are based upon two designs: the Norwegian Tapchan-System; and the system based on the principle of oscillating water column. The latter also shows that the simplicity of the system has been the dominant consideration. These plants have outputs of several hundred kW. Small plants of the Masuda-type exist for about 25 yr on offshore navigation buoys. The output is of the order of several 100W. The system is not suitable for large plants. Combinated wave power/breakwater systems are studied in Japan. This system is for energy supply to port facilities and not suitable for large plants. A further problem with wave energy is that with time varying energy supply. This affects the efficiency of conversion and supply of energy, both as electrical or mechanical energy, and makes the provision of some means of energy storage essential. The type and use of a wave energy plant is a function of the locality. No suitable sites exist on German coasts and hence the utilisation of wave energy is not an interesting topic here. Even in Norway, the in wave energy utilisation leading firm KVAERNER has abandonned its activities in this field. The future of wave power utilisation appears to lie in application on isolated coasts, Pacific Islands, etc as alternatives to oil powered generating plants. -from English summary

TI  - Feasibility study of off-grid sustainable energy system for coastal bhasan char to rehabilitate rohinga refugees
AB  - Government of Bangladesh (GoB) is implementing an emergency humanitarian project at coastal island Bhasan Char under Hatiya of Noakhali District, from September 2017 to temporarily rehabilitate a portion of incoming Rohinga refugees before they can repatriate to their home land, Myanmar. Under this project, GoB will carry out land development, construction of embankment as well as other infrastructures. This study is aimed at providing partial basic energy support to the government's initiative of rehabilitating 103,200 Rohinga refugees. Under the study, we check the feasibility of establishing off-grid sustainable energy system. We also perform the financial analysis of the proposed energy system by considering 20 years life-span of the project. Our study shows that annual average solar insolation in Bhasan char is 4.82kWh/m2/day and daily bright sunshine hour varies from 3 hours to 11 hours. Wind flow data of Bhasan char shows the average annual wind speed of 3.74m/s which is available round the clock and throughout the year. These data justify the suitability of environment friendly off-grid solar energy system as well as wind energy system for Bhasan Char. However, considering the effective generation hours, to diversify energy sources and basing on analysis result using HOMER (Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources) software - we are proposing a hybrid energy system with 40% contribution from wind and rest 60% from solar. Our financial analysis of the project shows a total cost of 43.848 Crore (USD 0.525 Crore) over 20-year life span. Therefore, a BDT 2.192 Crore/year is quite economical and justifiable, considering the long-term impact that it might provide to displaced 103,200 refugees as well as the solution that we are providing to adverse negative socio-economic impact on Bangladesh from Rohinga issue.

TI  - A Mixed Model- and Data-Driven Approach for Subsynchronous Oscillation Analysis of VSC-HVDC Grid-Connected Offshore Wind Farm
AB  - The previous research on the subsynchronous oscillation (SSO) caused by Voltage source converter-based high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) grid-connected offshore wind farm is based on model-driven method, but the model-driven research method has much inapplicability in multiple scenarios affected by external factors. The data-driven method has the merits of mining the characteristics from the external factors, so as to improve the applicability of the model-driven method in multiple scenarios. This paper proposes a mixed model- and data-driven approach for SSO analysis of VSC-HVDC grid-connected offshore wind farm. In model-driven stage, the small signal model of the system is established. SSO modes and the strongly correlated parameters are identified and their influence on the damping characteristics of the system is analyzed. In data-driven stage, data is processed based on the model-driven results. The Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithm is applied to cluster Wind speed & current data, and the relationship between clusters and system stability is obtained. Â© 2021 IEEE

As a key equipment in VSC-HVDC, DC circuit breaker has attracted more and more attention. With the analysis of existing current DC circuit breaker, this paper proposed a technical solution of the hybrid DC circuit breaker based on cascaded Insulated Gate Bipolar Translator (IGBT) full bridge sub modules, introduced the topology of breaking principle, deduced the parameter design method of each component of circuit breaker, and analyzed the influence of several factors such as the number of cascaded modules of IGBT full bridge on the breaking performance of circuit breaker. In this solution, in normal flow state, the main branch with low on-state loss is composed of fast mechanical switch and fewer semiconductor devices. When the current is broken off, the current is transferred to the transfer branch through the cooperation of the main branch and the transfer branch semiconductor device. Then the capacitor is charged by the system voltage in order to achieve second transfer. Finally, the system energy is absorbed and dissipated by the energy dissipation branch. The technical solution achieved the fast break ability with short-circuit current peak value of 15kA under DC voltage of 10kV, and the breaking time is less than 3ms. The DC circuit breaker solution: 1) Adopt modular cascade design with good expansibility. 2) Adopt Bridge structure which can realize two-way breaking, and there is no need to adjust trigger time and device parameters for different short-circuit current. 3) Low on-state loss, externally manifested as low impedance. In summary, the proposed breaking solution of hybrid DC circuit breaker can quickly break off short-circuit current. It is one of the effective solutions for the future development of networking VSC-HVDC distribution system. Â© 2020 IEEE.

TI  - Simplified site-screening method for micro tidal current turbines applied in Mozambique
AB  - A variety of tidal current turbines (TCT) are emerging, the majority focussing on large-scale extraction of renewable energy at global tidal hot-spots. Concurrently, some turbines are small and may be suitable also for micro-scale applications (micro-TCT) in remote areas, such as decentralized electrification in countries where fuel-independent energy systems with high power predictability are particularly important. In shallow waters the force of tidal currents varies considerably over short distances and very site-specific measurements are important for assessment of localization, but are also expensive. For micro-TCT to be of interest site-screening and evaluation must be inexpensive, and low-cost methods are thus required. This study proposes a simplified tidal model that is calibrated to site-specific conditions by short-term observations using lightweight equipment. By measurements comprising down to 8% of the monthly tidal period the potential power output can be estimated, with uncertainty intervals up to Â±20%, for currents applicable for micro-TCT. This site-screening method was tested at five sites in Mozambique where near-shore tidal currents were measured with lightweight current meters. At three of the sites, currents were estimated to exceed 1 m s -1 and power output was calculated based on technical assumptions for a micro-TCT device. Results are discussed from the perspective of micro-TCT development and decentralized remote area electrification. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper aims to solve the state's hydropower dependence, build energy security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a hybrid renewable energy system and its implementation in Willingdon Island. Hybrid Optimisation of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) is used to find the optimal solution for two grid-connected and off-grid scenarios. Of the 19 solutions, an optimal off-grid, an optimal grid-connected, a 100% variable renewable energy, and a diversified energy portfolio option are selected, analyzed, and ranked based on their techno-economic and emissions characteristics. The results suggest the combination of PV/Wind/Grid with a cost of energy of $0.044 as an optimal solution for the Island. The diversified energy solution takes the second position, having 51.4% and 38.8% solar and wind, respectively. Â© 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Damage detection for tripod-type offshore wind turbine structures using modal strain energy methods
AB  - In this paper, a thorough damage detection study for tripod-type offshore wind turbine (OWT) structure is investigated. First, two damage locations are chosen based on the strength analysis results. Damages are simulated according to the likely damage patterns of each member. Modal strain energy (MSE) method and modal strain energy decomposition (MSED) method are applied for the damage detection procedure where the "measured" data are generated from a finiteelement model while adding the simulated measurement noise. Both complete and incomplete measured modal data cases are considered during various damage scenarios. The numerical results suggest that damage members can be diagnosed exactly with complete modal data. When spatial incomplete modal data is available, the damage area can be identified.

TI  - Electrical energy storage systems
AB  - This chapter examines electrical energy storage systems (ESSs) for wave energy converters (WECs). The motivations for including on-board energy storage are outlined in terms of power smoothing, low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) and ancillary services. Various wave energy converter technologies are explored as well as their inherent energy storage mechanisms. Electrical energy storage technologies, including batteries, capacitors, and supercapacitors, are then compared. Two case studies are described where electrical energy storage, namely supercapacitor energy storage, is applied to help smooth the output power from a WEC. The first case study examines power smoothing for a SEAREV WEC and the second case studies explores smoothing the output power from an offshore oscillating water column (OWC) WEC operated at variable speed.

TI  - Perspectives on a way forward for ocean renewable energy in Australia
AB  - Australia has considerable wave and tidal ocean energy resources. Development of the emerging ocean renewable energy (ORE) industry in Australia offers opportunities to build Australia's blue economy, while actively contributing to committed carbon mitigation measures. Many interdisciplinary challenges are currently hampering development of the industry in Australia, and globally, including technology, cost reduction, policy and regulations, potential for environmental effects, awareness and investment, amongst others. In October 2016, ORE technology and project developers, researchers, academics, policy makers and other stakeholders in Australia's emerging ORE industry came together to identify these challenges and develop possible pathways to grow ocean energy in Australia. Four themes were identified: Technology Development; Education and Awareness; Policy and Regulation; and Finance and Investment. This paper documents the outcomes of the meeting identifying challenges and a way forward against each theme. A key element identified across all themes was the need for stronger coordination across the sector, and the need for a representing body to lead necessary initiatives to support growth and management of the ORE industry in Australia, as one element of a burgeoning blue economy.

TI  - Flexibility Analysis of O&G Platform Power System with Wind Energy Integration
AB  - Many researchers and operators are assessing the impact of wind energy integration into the gas turbines based conventional power system due to the intermittent and variable nature. The flexibility characteristics of the gas turbines are vital to guarantee adequate performance at different levels of wind energy penetration to meet the demand of the O&G platform. This study aims to verify the impact of increasing flexibility of the offshore O&G platformâ€™s power system. Therefore, the conventional O&G platform power system is modelled and compared with the post-flexibilization or state-of-the-art power system at different dynamic restrictions of the Open-Cycle Gas Turbines (OCGT) like ramp rates, minimum loading, uptime and downtime, and start-up/shut-down costs. Subsequently, the conventional and state-of-the-art power system model are then simulated at different levels of wind energy penetration, to analyze the system response of the O&G platform, as the intermittent wind energy can generate critical power system instability and imbalance. The proposed model has 4 OCGTs of 33.3MW (locally installed at the O&G platform) and 4 offshore floating wind turbines of 15MW that is satisfying 2 different load profiles of O&G platform (68MW and 34MW average load). The simulation results highlighted that the state-of-the-art power system accommodated higher shares of wind energy as compared to the conventional power system due to the flexible constraints. Also, the flexible power system achieved higher levels of fuel saving, when simulated for 100 hours. The same case study was considered for 25 years and the hours of fuel saving at 5% was 1733 hours and 20% of wind penetration resulted in 1857 hours of fuel saving. The study was performed in the modified Python for Power System Analysis (PyPSA), a python based free simulation toolbox for optimizing the power dispatch. Â© 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing.

TI  - Analysis of grid-connected operation characteristics and limit access capacity of offshore wind farms
AB  - Wind power is a relatively ripe renewable energy power generation technology, which has the superiority of large-scale development and utilization. Large-scale deep-sea wind farms are a significant direction for wind power development. With the continuous growth of the capacity of a single offshore wind farm, it is necessary to study the impact of grid connection of large-capacity offshore wind farms on the normal operation of the power grid, which can guarantee the safety and stability of the power grid. Based on the smooth working of the power system, it is meaningful to determining the limit access capacity of offshore wind farms for guiding offshore wind power planning. In this paper, an evaluation index system for the operation characteristics of offshore wind farms integrated into regional power grids is constructed, and based on that, the influence of offshore wind farms on the safety, stability, economy and power quality of regional power system operation is studied, and the grid-connected power limit of offshore wind farms is further calculated.

TI  - Wave resource in El Hierro-an island towards energy self-sufficiency
AB  - The island of El Hierro (Spain), a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in the Atlantic Ocean, aims to become the first 100% renewable energy island in the world. With a â‚¬54 million wind project already under way, the present research looks at the island's wave resource using a 44-year hindcast dataset obtained through numerical modelling. The geographical distribution of wave energy is examined on the basis of eight study sites around the island. A substantial resource is found west and north of El Hierro, with average wave power in the order of 25 kW m-1 and total annual energy in excess 200 MW h m-1; the resource is less abundant east and south of the island. In addition to these geographical variations, wave energy in El Hierro presents seasonal variations, with energetic winters and mild summers. After analysing the total resource and its spatial and seasonal variations, its composition in terms of sea states (significant wave heights and energy periods) is examined, and how this composition affects the selection of the Wave Energy Converters to be installed is discussed.

TI  - 7 years meteomast Amrumbank west
AB  - Renewable Energy can satisfy a big part of the energy demand without any restrictions for the following generations. In these concepts the wind energy is an important source. Projects of using wind energy at offshore sites in the German Bight are now starting to build those windfarms. For the estimation of the average annual wind speed distribution and thus the energy production of offshore windfarms it is very important to know the exact wind conditions at each project site. Suitable prognosis methods are missing so far. The methods used at onshore wind locations cannot be transferred to offshore sites. The prognosis errors would be too large. The only possibility to achieve exact information about the wind conditions is a metmast. In spring 2005 the German offshore-research platform Amrumbank West started the operation in the German Bight, 45 km north of the island of Helgoland. One of the main targets is the acquisition of new knowledge about the marine atmospheric boundary layer as well as a better understanding of the meteorological and hydrographical conditions in the offshore area. Meteorological measurements are focused on capturing the wind conditions and the vertical temperature characteristics.

TI  - Analytical estimates of the energy yield potential from the Alderney Race (Channel Islands) using marine current energy converters
AB  - Energy from marine currents offers the promise of regular and predictable electrical generation at higher power densities than other renewables. The marine current resource is potentially large but mainly concentrated in a number of sites around the world. The power density for a horizontal axis turbine operating in such currents has a similar form to that of a wind turbine and is dependent on the cube of the velocity and the fluid density which for water is about 1000 times that of air. These two factors imply that the power density for marine current energy converters will be appreciably higher than that of wind generators resulting in smaller and hence more manageable size turbines. In the UK, for example, tidal races which exist in the waters around the Channel Islands and the 'Sounds' off the Scottish west coast are well known. The energy density at such sites is high due land mass constrictions which result in large current velocities at depths which are suitable for the installation of multiple arrays of turbines. This study was undertaken for the purpose of quantifying the potential of generating electricity from the Alderney Race in the Channel Islands. The work quantifies the resource, identifies fluid currents that could be used for the establishment of various size arrays in the race and constructs some logical course of action and direction for the installation of marine current turbines in arrays in the Race. The analytically predicted results for the selected site of the Alderney race showed that such installations can realise energy yields in excess of 7.4 TWh which is equivalent to 2% of the UK requirements for the year 2000. However, despite the totally predictable resource the energy yield of the site followed an uneven power production which could be used in a planned mixed power production structure. The analysis, although based on data from Admiralty Charts, has shown that there is a large potential for energy generation from such sites. Furthermore, and by virtue of the topography of the site, it is feasible to envisage a modular approach to the installation of size-dependent marine energy conversion devices or turbines to be deployed in phases taking into account technology progression and developments.

TI  - Technological Innovations in Russian Renewable Energy Projects
AB  - Since 2011, 34 technology platforms have been created within the framework of Russiaâ€™s industrial policy in key areas: medicine and biotechnology, information and communication technologies, photonics, aerospace, nuclear technologies, energy, transport, new materials and metallurgy, natural resource extraction, production technologies, and ecology. Despite the fact that they were initiated during the difficult post-crisis period, they represent roadmaps for accelerated development in the context of the Russian economy until 2030. In this article, we discuss ideas for global technological innovations in the following areas: bioenergy, hydropower, geothermal energy, wind energy, solar energy, and marine energy. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, global research and development expenditures amount to $1200 billion annually. National figures vary greatly, for example, the amount of R&D in Russia is 1% of GDP, and in the Republic of Koreaâ€”2.7% of GDP. About $10 billion. US $0.8% of the total amount is allocated to research and development in the field of renewable energy sources. In order to effectively channel these funds both for commercial purposes and through the state budget, it is necessary to identify technological priorities in the field of renewable energy sources. Renewable energy sources (RES) are a modern high-tech innovative sector with double-digit annual growth rates with significant potential for improvement and the emergence of new technologies, attracting domestic and international investment. In the potentially vast Russian market, this is a window of opportunity. The main question is whether Russian technology platforms correspond to global trends in promoting renewable energy. Since 2011, 34 technology platforms have been created as part of Russiaâ€™s industrial policy. Despite the fact that they were initiated during a difficult post-crisis period, they represent a significant number of challenges.

TI  - Stochastic risk-sensitive market integration for renewable energy: Application to ocean wave power plants
AB  - With the expected increase of intermittent renewable energy resources on the electric power grid, short-term reserve markets can prove to be a critical reliability asset. This paper introduces and tests a potential market structure that includes a short-term reserve market for renewable resources where the realized energy is drawn within the bounds of the hourly capacity offered. The study presents a risk-aware stochastic model that determines, based on the day-ahead offer derived using a classic newsvendor formula, the best intraday offers for a renewable energy power plant. The stochastic approach takes into account the uncertainties of energy production and market prices. The proposed risk-sensitive model aims to maximize the renewable power plant's revenues and minimize potential risks of loss in a multi-product multi-timescale market setup. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formulation, we study the case of a hypothetical 750-kW wave power plant coupled with energy storage. The study shows that the risk of profit loss is not uniformly distributed across the risk-aversion factor space. We also find that the introduction of the short-term reserve market results in a wider range of conditional value at risk while inducing 5% profit increase and a lower profit reduction across the risk range. In addition, the study reveals that the short-term reserve market is profitable for both the system operator and the wave energy power plant considered. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - A Model for the Spectrum of the Lateral Velocity Component from Mesoscale to Microscale and Its Application to Wind-Direction Variation
AB  - A model for the spectrum of the lateral velocity component Sv(f) is developed for a frequency range from about 0.2 day - 1 to the turbulence inertial subrange, with the intent of improving the calculation of flow meandering over areas the size of offshore wind farms and clusters. These sizes can correspond to a temporal scale of several hours, much larger than the validity limit of typical boundary-layer models, such as the Kaimal model, or the Mikkelsenâ€“Tchen model. The development of the model is based on observations from one site and verified with observations from another site up to a height of 241Â m. The model describes three ranges: (1) the mesoscale from 0.2day-1 to about 10-3Hz where a mesoscale spectral model from LarsÃ©n et al. (2013: QJR Meteorol Soc 139: 685â€“700) is used; (2) the spectral gap where the normalized v spectrum, fSv(f) , can be approximated to be a constant; (3) the high-frequency range where a boundary-layer model is used. In order to demonstrate a general applicability of the lateral velocity spectrum model to reproduce the statistics of wind-direction variability, models for both horizontal velocity components, u and v, are used through an inverse Fourier transform technique to produce time series of both components, which in theory could have been the ensemble for calculating the corresponding spectra. The ensemble is then used to calculate directional statistics, which in turn are compared with corresponding statistics from the measured time series. We demonstrate the relevance of the constructed spectral models for calculating meandering effects for large wind farms and wind-farm clusters. Â© 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

Moreover, to investigate the possibility of the use of ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) in the offshore regions, the surface water temperature data obtained from ECMWF from 2005 to 2014 was used, the number of days that the ocean thermal energy conversion could be used in the field was calculated. The findings show that the use of the ocean thermal energy conversion is only possible in the southern basin during Julyâ€“September. The fields of Sardar Jangal, Shahdeniz, Ganeshli and Azari are the only oil and gas fields that can use this energy 54, 34, 31 and 31 days a year, respectively. In the field of solar radiation, the southern basin with an annual average of 1550 [Formula presented] is the most suitable basin and Sardar Jangal field with the monthly average of 131.81 [Formula presented] is the most suitable field for the use of solar energy.

TI  - The assessment of offshore wind power potential of Turkey
AB  - In this paper, the offshore wind power potential assessment of Turkey is presented. Due to the increased amounts of energy needs, the need for energy supply from renewable energy sources has increased in the world. Turkey with its growing industry, economy, and population has high energy demands thus investments on all renewable energy resources primarily on wind power has shown increase in the last decade. However there is still dependence on foreign energy resources. This paper examines the suitability of 54 coastal regions for offshore wind power installation. The study reveals that among 54 regions 10 of them are suitable for plant installation but initially Bozcaada, Amasra, Samandagi, Gokceada and Inebolu coastal regions should be considered for offshore wind power generation due to higher wind speeds but further analysis should be carried out before making the final decision.

TI  - UTILITY VIEW OF THE POTENTIAL FOR LARGE WIND TURBINES.
AB  - Although competitive generation costs were promised from large machines in the MW-size range at the time the CEGB announced its windpower programme, that promise has yet to be realised. This appears to be partly due to the complexity of the large machines; partly due to the lack of production orders. For a utility such as the CEGB these machines are a more attractive proposition for electricity generation, since fewer would be needed. When commercially developed, wind turbines will need to compete economically with other plant. Reference is made to the detailed analysis of the prospects for wind generation carried out as part of the economic analysis for the Sizewell 'B' PWR Inquiry. This produced target costs for wind turbines for different wind regimes and economic scenarios. The paper also reviews the status of offshore windpower and integration of wind energy into a large utility system.

TI  - Velocity deficit and swirl in the turbulent wake of a wind turbine
AB  - Energy production data from several of the existing large offshore wind farms indicate that turbine arrays can suffer from a significant overall energy production shortfall, due to wakes generated by turbines upstream interacting with turbines downstream. An experimental investigation of the axial and azimuthal (swirl) velocity field in the wake of a single three-bladed wind turbine with rotor diameter of 0.91 m was conducted. The turbinewas positioned in the free stream, near the entrance of the 6 m Ã— 2.7 m cross section of the UNH Flow Physics Facility, a 72-m-long boundary layer wind tunnel. The turbine model was tested at various rotor loading conditions with blade tip-speed ratios up to 2.8. A Pitot-static tube and constant temperature hotwire anemometry with a multiwire sensor were used to obtain velocity field measurements in the wake of themodel turbine up to 20 diameters downstream. The results of an equilibriumsimilarity theory for the axisymmetric wake with rotation are presented. The measurements obtained were used to examine the validity of the derived scaling functions for streamwise and azimuthal velocity, wake growth, and turbulence.

TI  - Organising direction of innovation ecosystems for extended clean energy production
AB  - This study aims to reveal how innovation ecosystems can organise value creation without a focal firm or a platform during the pre-phases of innovation. This has been scarcely researched hitherto; therefore, a participatory action research approach is used to reveal essential phenomena emerging in collaboration with research participants. An extended approach for innovation ecosystems to create value in society is hereby revealed beyond the coordination done by a focal firm or a platform, as noted in previous research. The study was conducted from September 2017 to June 2018 in a port in the Baltic Sea. Four enterprises participated in representing complementary activities for value creation in the pre-phases of establishing a new offshore wind park within the wind-energy innovation ecosystem. The findings are summarised using in the â€˜EcoValue BMIâ€™ model. The findings highlight the essential role of value proposition in innovation ecosystems in focusing and structuring the direction of complementary independent initiatives for value creation, as noted in the middle of the model. All participating enterprises could identify the overall ecosystem value proposition. This insight into the overall value proposition is realised by organising collaborative business model innovation (BMI) to set horizontal innovation directions for exploration and exploitation of interfaces and flow among ecosystem participants for cleaner energy production. Further research is required to verify and enhance the â€˜EcoValue BMIâ€™ findings through new research conducted in similar large innovation ecosystems without a focal firm or a platform to coordinate the innovation ecosystem for value creation in society.

TI  - Analysis of a floating wave energy converter with hydraulicmechanical power take-off using wec-sim and simscape
AB  - A novel multibody 'self-reacting' floating wave energy converter, which constitutes a set of 'bean' shape tubular floats which pitch relative to the central spar (CS) resulting in net heave, is introduced in the present study abbreviated as BFWEC. The frequency-domain modeling is performed assuming potential wave theory (PWT) to obtain the fundamental building blocks viz., hydrodynamic parameters of BFWEC. The unique configuration of BFWEC with a set of four floats around CS projects it to be a novel attribute. The relative motion between CS and floats is enabled using a connecting frame and the hinge joint to each bean float. Time-domain wave-WEC interactions, along with free-decay tests, are modeled and conducted using a highly established and reliable open source MATLAB-Simulink module called WEC-Sim (Wave Energy Converter SIMulator). The CS of six degrees BFWEC with a dominant heave degree is first restricted to be fixed and later enabled to three and six degrees of freedom (D-o-F) to understand the influence of its compliance. The device is restrained and kept in position by fastening four tethers (taut mooring) to the CS by coupling it to a lumped mass stand-alone mooring line feature known as MoorDyn. A hydraulic-mechanical Power take-off (PTO) unit is coupled with BFWEC in SIMSCAPE to understand its overall performance characteristics, which is later compared with linear damping virtual PTO. The performance ratio of the device is then obtained under 0Â° and 45Â° regular waves. The critical outcome of the research is to establish a robust green channel by promoting wave energy extraction in the sea states of the Indian sub-continent with a unique and suitable design.

TI  - Assimilating a time-domain representation of a wave energy converter into a spectral wave model
AB  - To accommodate future power demands, wave energy converters (WECs) will be deployed in arrays, but largely unanswered questions of the annual energy production and environmental impact of such installations present regulatory dilemmas. In recent years, Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) has developed a modified version of the Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN) wave model to simulate WEC energy extraction in a propagating wave field. The SNL source code modifications to SWAN have facilitated a way to characterize the frequency dependent power absorption of a device in a spectral model using standard WEC parameterizations. The work presented in this paper seeks to build on source code modifications previously made by SNL. A new WEC metamodel, alters the incident wave spectrum based on power extracted from the sea and dissipated by hydrodynamic losses experienced at the WEC. These losses are calculated in an external six degree of freedom (DOF) time domain WEC simulation. The two WEC models were compared in terms of significant wave height reduction in the WEC's lee and annual power production. The new model reduced the estimated distance required for the waves to recover 95% of the incident wave height by 50% for the same sea state. A 4.5% difference in annual power production was observed for a WEC operating in the lee of another device when deployed off the west coast of Canada. Â© Copyright 2016 by ASME.

TI  - Multi-terminal DC transmission systems for connecting large offshore wind farms
AB  - This paper describes the use of voltage source converter (VSC) based, multi-terminal (MT) HVDC transmission system technology for connecting large doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind farms, over long distance. The operational principles of the proposed system are described and control strategies for coordinating various grid side converters are proposed, to ensure smooth system operation and power sharing between various AC networks. DC voltage control and DC droop characteristics are implemented for the grid side VSC which transmit wind farm generated power to AC grids. PSCAD/EMTDC simulations for a four-terminal DC system for connecting two wind farms to two different AC networks are presented to demonstrate robust performance during wind speed and power variations, and large disturbances caused by the trip of one of the wind farms.

TI  - Machine Learning Control for Floating Offshore Wind Turbine Individual Blade Pitch Control
AB  - The cost of energy from current floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) are not economical due to inefficiencies and maintenance costs, leaving significant renewable energy resources untapped. Co-designing lighter less expensive FOWTs with individual pitch control (IPC) of each blade could increase efficiencies, decreases costs, and make offshore wind economically viable. However, the nonlinear dynamics and breadth of nonstationary wind and wave loading present challenges to designing effective and robust IPC for each desired location and situation.This manuscript presents the development, design, and simulation of machine learning control (MLC) for IPC of FOWTs. MLC has been shown effective for many complex nonlinear fluid-structure interaction problems. This project investigates scaling up these component-level control problems to the system level control of the NREL 5MW OC3 FOWT. A massively parallel genetic program (GP) is developed using MATLAB Simulink and OpenFAST that efficiently evaluates new individuals and selectively tests fitness of each generation in the most challenging design load case. The proposed controller was compared to a baseline PID controller using a cost function that captured the value of annual energy production with maintenance costs correlated to ultimate loads and harmonic fatigue. The proposed controller achieved 67% of the cost of the baseline PID controller, resulting in 4th place in the ARPA-E ATLAS Offshore competition for IPC of the OC3 FOWT for the given design load cases.

TI  - A novel transmission system planning method combining market simulations and load flow calculations for identifying bottlenecks in systems with large RES penetration
AB  - An important task for transmission system operators (TSO) is to assess and predict load flows for network planning and network expansions, in order to avoid bottleneck situations. This task is becoming more difficult and important due to the on-going liberalization process and the integration of renewable energy sources (RES) in the EU power systems, especially onshore and offshore wind power. These developments have increased the uncertainty of load flows, which are the result of size and locations of generation and demand in the network. Rather than point in time planning analysis, multiple load flow simulations are needed to assess the worst loading levels of transmission system components, in particular lines and transformers. The developments in generation require a new approach towards transmission system planning. The method presented in this paper offers the possibility to simulate many different combinations of demand and generation and to assess the loadings of the transmission system components by using two simulation models; the unit commitment and economic dispatch (UC-ED) model and the load flow model. The method is applied to investigate the effects of the future integration with large scale RES power in the CWE grid (Belgium, Netherlands, Luxemburg, France and Germany). In this paper the first results for the simulation of the UC-ED model for the combined CWE grid is presented. The level of detail regarding location of generation and allocation of load of the UC-ED simulation differs per country. A set of methods to apply the results of these UC-ED simulations into load flow calculations are presented. The concept shows the significance of combining UC-ED and load flow simulations. The amount of data that results from this method exceeds the current point in time load flow calculation. An evaluation of various graphical methods to present the results for multiple load flow analysis is shown, based on load flows obtained from measurement data of a relative small grid.

TI  - A Techno-Economic Analysis of meshed Topologies of Offshore Wind HVAC Transmission
AB  - This work develops a method of quantifying the effect of adding meshed connections to radial network topologies used for offshore extraction. The method accounts for Capital Expenditures (CAPEX), Corrective maintenance (CM), losses and Expected Energy Not Transmitted (EENT). The stochastic nature of wind is also accounted for. The method is applied to a statistically significant randomly generated population of Offshore Wind Power Plant (OWPP) pairs. Analysis of both Medium Voltage (MV) and High Voltage (HV) bus meshing is performed. It is demonstrated that in the two OWPPs case meshed connections have a narrow but significant region of applicability. Further, the method is applied to a system of 6 wind farms and compared to the lowest cost radial connection, using a number of different planning horizons. It is shown that the optimal radial topology is no longer the clear choice as the development horizon increases. Â© 2021 IEEE.

TI  - Remotely monitoring offshore wind turbines via ZigBee networks embedded with an advanced routing strategy
AB  - As better wind speeds are available offshore compared to on land, offshore wind power contribution in terms of electricity supplied is higher, thus more and more offshore wind turbines have been and will be deployed. However, the severe offshore conditions make it necessary to develop reliable and cost-effective real-time monitoring system when building offshore wind power farms. This paper proposes an innovative method for designing remote monitoring system for offshore wind turbines based on ZigBee wireless sensor networks. ZigBee networks carrying variety of sensors actively collect dynamic data related to the system operation status, including parameters of the mechanical unit and electrical unit as well as the operation environment. Each wind turbine itself represents a single wireless network, which sends information to remote monitoring center by GPRS module to achieve full wireless communication. To enhance the topologic efficiency and reduce the energy consumption of the networks, an optimized routing algorithm is developed. A physical system based on such method is developed. Analysis and experiment tests with real wind farm data indicate that the developed system works fairly well. The fundamental idea as studied in this work is of great value for building reliable and affordable real-time monitoring systems for wind farms (offshore and on land) with enhanced safety and efficiency.

TI  - The impact of European balancing rules on wind power economics and on short-term bidding strategies
AB  - Wind power represents a significant percentage of the European generation mix and this will increase to fulfill the renewable energy targets. Different balancing rules are applied to wind power among the countries; for instance, to what extent wind power producers (WPPs) are responsible for the energy imbalances and how those imbalances are penalized. This paper discusses those different rules and evaluates their effects on WPP bidding strategies. To do so, a quantitative analysis is presented for an offshore wind farm, considering the differences in the balancing rules and prices of Belgium, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. The quantitative approach consists of a stochastic optimization model that maximizes the profits of a WPP by trading in different markets (day-ahead and intraday) and computes the final energy delivered. The model considers uncertainties of most important parameters such as wind energy forecasts and prices at different time frames. The results show that the imbalance pricing design and the allocation of balance responsibility significantly affect WPP' revenues. Additionally, WPPs deviate differently from the expected energy depending on the balancing rules, which can impact the system. Furthermore, these balancing rules should be considered with other market regulations, such as the design of support schemes. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The influence of stretch rate, the concentration of the NaCl solution and the temperature in the solution on the stress corrosion cracking of Q345 steel for offshore wind turbine tower was investigated by means of the slow strain rate tensile test. The experimental results show that the stress corrosion susceptibility of Q345 steel in NaCl solution tends to increase monotonically with the decrease of the tensile rate. When the tensile rate is 4Ã—10-7 s-1, the specimen has undergone stress corrosion cracking. The environmental medium greatly reduces the tensile strength, total strain and fracture energy of the Q345 steel. And the sensitivity of stress corrosion cracking of Q345 steel increases with the increase of NaCl concentration. The effect of temperature on the stress corrosion susceptibility of the material is large, and the sensitivity index increased significantly with the increase of temperature. When the temperature is 50â„ƒ, it has obvious stress corrosion tendency. Â© 2020, Solar Energy Periodical Office Co., Ltd. All right reserved.

TI  - Study of offshore monopile behaviour due to ocean waves
AB  - Offshore monopile foundations are one of the most commonly used foundation structures in offshore renewable energy, especially in areas with relatively shallow water. They are characterised by relatively large geometric dimensions compared with other offshore pile foundations and differ from onshore piles in that they suffer from more dynamic ocean environments during their lifetime. One of the most significant aspects is associated with the wave effect on the structural behaviour of monopile foundations. In this study, a three-dimensional scaled boundary finite element model (SBFEM) is proposed to investigate structural responses of monopile foundations when exposed to ocean waves. Unlike other numerical techniques, SBFEM provides an analytical solution in the radial direction with numerical approximation along the discretised faces of the monopile foundation. The SBFEM model is validated by an equivalent finite element model, by which favourable computational efficiency and reliable accuracy are demonstrated. Subsequently, a parametric study is carried out focussing on various wave properties to gain an insight into monopile behaviour. Results show that the lateral displacement of the monopile foundation increases as wave numbers, wave amplitudes or water depths increase. This study aims at improving the design of offshore monopile foundations, when wave load is a dominant factor. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Tidal barrages in the UK: Ecological and social impacts, potential mitigation, and tools to support barrage planning
AB  - The UK Government is committed to ambitious targets to reduce carbon emissions. The large tidal ranges in estuaries on the west coast of the UK make the deployment of tidal barrages an attractive proposition, and repeated feasibility studies have been undertaken. No barrage scheme has yet been taken forward, and one factor contributing to this reluctance to proceed is the significant environmental impacts that could result from the barrage construction and operation. This paper provides a detailed review of the current understanding of the potential ecological and social impacts of tidal barrages, including a case study of La Rance in northern France, and a discussion of strategies for mitigating barrage impacts. The review considers how more comprehensive ecological modelling could reduce uncertainty in predicting the impacts in specific estuaries, and discusses the use of Multi-criteria Analysis and ecosystem valuation as tools for evaluating the disparate costs and benefits of barrages schemes.

TI  - Unmanned aerial drones for inspection of offshore wind turbines: A mission-critical failure analysis
AB  - With increasing global investment in offshore wind energy and rapid deployment of wind power technologies in deep water hazardous environments, the in-service inspection of wind turbines and their related infrastructure plays an important role in the safe and efficient operation of wind farm fleets. The use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and remotely piloted aircraft (RPA)â€”commonly known as â€œdronesâ€â€”for remote inspection of wind energy infrastructure has received a great deal of attention in recent years. Drones have significant potential to reduce not only the number of times that personnel will need to travel to and climb up the wind turbines, but also the amount of heavy lifting equipment required to carry out the dangerous inspection works. Drones can also shorten the duration of downtime needed to detect defects and collect diagnostic information from the entire wind farm. Despite all these potential benefits, the drone-based inspection technology in the offshore wind industry is still at an early stage of development and its reliability has yet to be proven. Any unforeseen failure of the drone system during its mission may cause an interruption in inspection operations, and thereby, significant reduction in the electricity generated by wind turbines. In this paper, we propose a semiquantitative reliability analysis framework to identify and evaluate the criticality of mission failuresâ€”at both system and component levelsâ€”in inspection drones, with the goal of lowering the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs as well as improving personnel safety in offshore wind farms. Our framework is built based upon two well-established failure analysis methodologies, namely, fault tree analysis (FTA) and failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA). It is then tested and verified on a drone prototype, which was developed in the laboratory for taking aerial photography and video of both onshore and offshore wind turbines. The most significant failure modes and underlying root causes within the drone system are identified, and the effects of the failures on the systemâ€™s operation are analysed. Finally, some innovative solutions are proposed on how to minimize the risks associated with mission failures in inspection drones. Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Risk of collision between service vessels and offshore wind turbines
AB  - Offshore wind farms are growing in size and are situated farther and farther away from shore. The demand for service visits to transfer personnel and equipment to the wind turbines is increasing, and safe operation of the vessels is essential. Currently, collisions between service vessels and offshore wind turbines are paid little attention to in the offshore wind energy industry. This paper proposes a risk assessment framework for such collisions and investigates the magnitude of the collision risk and important risk-influencing factors. The paper concludes that collisions between turbines and service vessels even at low speed may cause structural damage to the turbines. There is a need for improved consideration of this kind of collision risk when designing offshore wind turbines and wind farms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - GOVERNANCE CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS FOR OFFSHORE RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB  - As potential contributors to climate change mitigation and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and drivers of economic growth, harnessing offshore renewable energies (ORE) depends on safe and reliable technology, appropriate policy and regulatory instruments, and stable sources of funding. However, the nature, location and maturity of ORE have led to several legal and policy challenges which condition the success of these industries. Even though the ability to generate electricity from marine renewables is not in question, since technology is moving ahead of policy, its integration in wider energy networks might be problematic given the localised nature of the resources, and the high variability/low predictability of their output over multiple timescales. Limited practical experience with the deployment of these technologies coupled with the difficulty of studying the marine environment represent barriers to acquiring knowledge on their impacts, particularly wave and tidal energy. These data gaps are amplified by underdeveloped regulatory frameworks regarding marine planning and sitting processes, including Environmental Impact Assessment, not adapted to manage uncertainty, and often making it too difficult for potential developers to get consent and thus invest. As part of EU's Blue Growth Strategy, ORE's demand for exclusive rights over resources and a marine space creates potential conflicts by entering already congested oceans, traditionally regulated in a single-sector manner for different marine activities. Previously proposed solutions to these constraints have failed to acknowledge the combined importance of all types of environmental policy instruments: evolving legal frameworks, targets and commitments; practical differences in domestic implementation of regulation, market-based and suasive instruments; and fragmentation of institutional architectures associated with constantly evolving actor networks operating for ORE governance. Studying policy instrument mixes might demonstrate the changing roles of state and societal actors, and ultimately contribute for the debate surrounding the sustainability and governance transition to renewable energy.

AB  - The use of satellite-based remote sensing systems for observing marine environments is presented. Satellite observations of the marine environment, including weather, support efforts in economic development, national defense, resource management, and policy making, and contribute to the comfort, health, and safety of the public.

TI  - An equivalent modeling method for Offshore Wind Farms based on fault characteristics analysis
AB  - A large offshore wind farm usually consists of dozens or even hundreds of wind turbines. Due to the limitation of the simulation scale, it is necessary to develop an equivalent model of offshore wind farms for power system studies. At present, the aggregation method is widely adopted for wind farm equivalent modeling. In this paper, the topology, electrical parameters, operating conditions and individual turbine characteristics of the offshore wind farms are taken into consideration. Firstly, the output power distribution of offshore wind farm, the voltage distribution of the collector system and the fault ride-through characteristics of wind turbines are analyzed. Then, a dynamic equivalent modeling method for offshore wind farms is developed based on the fault characteristics analysis. Finally, the proposed method is validated through time-domain simulation.

TI  - Design and evaluation of a hybrid energy system for Masirah Island in Oman
AB  - This paper discusses the possibility of replacing or supplementing Masirah Islandâ€™s current diesel generation system with a hybrid energy system consisting of solar photovoltaics (PV), a wind turbine and a natural gas generator to meet the islandâ€™s growing electricity demand. Hybrid Optimisation Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) modelling software uses input data, including costs, resource data, technology components, and load data, to simulate a hybrid system. The list of options, ordered according to the systemâ€™s net present cost (NPC), is generated by the software. The results of the simulation identified the optimal option, which would be a combination of the wind turbine, natural gas, and diesel generators. This option gave the lowest NPC of 129 million $ and a cost of energy (COE) of 0.0724 $/kWh. This COE of the optimal hybrid energy system was very low compared to the COE of the current diesel system (0.302 $/kWh). It also resulted in a lower pollutant emission compared to the current diesel power system. Implementing a hybrid renewable energy system would ensure a low COE and less pollution for the island.

TI  - Experimental and numerical statistics of storm wave forces on a monopile in uni- and multidirectional seas
AB  - Experiments with both uni- and multidirectional wave realizations with a stiff pile subjected to extreme wave forces are considered. Differences in crest heights and force peaks resulting from directional spread waves are analysed. The wave realizations are reproduced numerically in the fully nonlinear wave model OceanWave3D. The numerical reproductions compare well to the experiments. Only for the largest forces significant differences are seen, which is due to a very simple breaking filter applied in OceanWave3D. In the wave spectra, the higher harmonics occur for smaller frequencies than the straight multiples of the peak frequency. Further, the higher harmonics of the multidirectional wave spectra contain less energy. Both effects can be explained by the second order wave theory. Finally, the computed wave kinematics are used to investigate the dynamic response of an offshore wind turbine. The excitation of the first natural frequency is largest for the unidirectional wave realizations, as the higher harmonics are largest for these realizations. Â© 2017 ASME.

TI  - Design procedure and performance estimation of tidal current power system
AB  - The demand to secure an alternative resource has been increased recently rather than fossil or nuclear powers. One of the affordable ocean energy is the tidal energy since it is considered as a reliable and predictable power source. The turbine is one of the essential components which can convert the tidal current into the rotational force. The design optimization of turbine can contribute significantly to the performance of system. There are several key aspects in the design of turbine.

TI  - Enabling technologies for autonomous offshore inspections by heterogeneous unmanned teams
AB  - This paper presents a concept for a heterogeneous unmanned team designed for autonomous persistent inspection of offshore wind turbines. This team consists of an unmanned surface vessel (USV) and an unmanned aerial system (UAS) operating cooperatively. We describe a concept of operations (CONOPS) in which the USV acts as a ground control station (gCS) for the UAS. The USV shuttles the UAS between turbines, recharges the UAS batteries, and provides a long-range data link to a remote operator. Near each turbine, the UAS is deployed from the USV, performs an inspection, and then returns to the USV so that it can transit to a different offshore wind turbine and initialize another inspection. This paper discusses the key enabling technologies required to field such a system, with focus on the problem of performing autonomous high-precision launch and landing of a UAS from a USV.

TI  - A Novel Transient Control Strategy for VSC-HVDC Connecting Offshore Wind Power Plant
AB  - This paper proposes a novel steady-state and transient management scheme for voltage source converter based high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) connecting permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG)-based offshore wind power plant (WPP). The proposed control arrangement aims to fully utilize the HVDC converters' normal loading capabilities during steady-state operation. Furthermore, it targets the employment of the available converters' overloading capabilities to enhance the fault ride through (FRT) performance during faults. The positive and negative sequence components are controlled to 1) neutralize dc-link voltage ripples due to asymmetrical grid faults, 2) inject reactive current support for the grid voltage, and 3) deliver the maximum possible active power during different faults. Novel mathematical and time-variant representations of the positive and negative sequence components are introduced to adapt the converter current limits for full utilization of the converter limit. Comprehensive simulation studies using PSCAD/EMTDC are presented to verify the functioning of the proposed control strategy.

TI  - Characteristics of Wind Resources and Post-Project Evaluation of Wind Farms in Coastal Areas of Zhejiang
AB  - As the onshore wind farm technology matures, offshore wind energy has attracted increasing attention. Zhejiang has coastal areas with massive potential for wind resources because of its geographical location. Therefore, understanding the wind resources in these areas can lay a foundation for future development and utilization. On this basis, this study used the measured wind field data of a wind farm along the coast of Zhejiang from March 2014 to February 2015 and from March 2016 to February 2018 to investigate and compare the characteristics of wind energy resources, including average wind speed, Weibull shape and scale factors, wind direction variation, and wind energy density. Then, the capacity coefficient of a wind turbine predicted using the wind farm data was compared with the actual capacity coefficients of two wind turbines in the wind farm in 2019. Results revealed the following observations: The overall variations in the evaluation indicators followed clear patterns over the 3 years. For example, the main wind direction in the same season was the same, and the variations in the monthly average wind speed, the monthly wind power density, and the theoretical capacity factors were highly similar. The time-series data indicated that the difference in the indicators between summer and autumn was significantly larger than that between other seasons, with the maximum difference in monthly average wind speed of 1.46 times and the maximum difference in monthly wind power density of 1.5 times. The comparison results of the capacity coefficient showed that the theoretical and actual capacity coefficients were extremely close when the monthly average wind speed was less than 6 m/s, with the average difference being less than 9\%. When the monthly average wind speed was greater than 6 m/s, the proximity between the theoretical and actual capacity coefficients was reduced, with an average difference of more than 9\% and a maximum value of 28\%. In general, the overall characteristics of wind resources in coastal areas of Zhejiang exhibited similar trends but fluctuated considerably in some months. Wind energy forecasts had significant discrepancies from the actual operation indicators of the wind farm when the wind speed was high.

TI  - Offshore wind-powered oil and gas fields: A preliminary investigation of the techno-economic viability for the offshore rio de janeiro, brazil
AB  - The electricity demand of offshore oil and gas platforms are traditionally supplied by gas turbines operating with natural gas extracted from the field or fossil fuels emitting CO2 and NOx. Offshore wind power is an interesting alternative to supply such a demand as it can be produced close to the oil and gas field and providing clean and renewable electricity. The objective of this research is to investigate, as a preliminary approach, the technoeconomic viability of supplying electricity demand of an oil and gas field by a floating offshore wind farm. An oil and gas field locates in the southeast of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with a distance of about 130 km from the shoreline, is selected as a case study. The wind resource at the local is obtained using in-situ measured data. Four wind turbines are studied and compared through their capacity factor and energy production. Afterward, four wind farms composing of the selected turbines are proposed based on the available wind energy and the field demand. The cost of energy produced by the wind farm is calculated, and the results are compared to the conventional method of the electricity supply. Â© 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

TI  - Wind resources for offshore wind farms: Characteristics and assessment
AB  - The wind resource assessment process characterizes the atmospheric environment through the application of industry-accepted measurement and modeling techniques. The goal is to address wind farm design and performance issues that arise during the development, construction, and operations phases. These issues relate to site selection, energy production estimation, turbine suitability and array layout, the balance-of-plant design, site accessibility, and other project elements. This chapter describes the nature of offshore wind regimes and related phenomena such as sea breezes, internal boundary layers, and tropical cyclones. It also provides a detailed survey of essential resource data parameters and observational approaches using measurement techniques ranging from satellite imagery and conventional fixed-tower platforms to floating lidar. Numerical models are described that assimilate observed data and simulate atmospheric and oceanographic conditions across a spectrum of time and space scales. The performance of turbine wake models is evaluated. Finally, future trends in resource assessment are summarized. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

TI  - Monopiles - Design drivers for optimisation
AB  - Foundation structures contribute about one third of the costs of offshore wind farms. They are therefore particularly suitable for optimisation. At DNV GL Energy a study was made with the focus on optimising the dead weight of a foundation structure. Basis for the study was the monopile of an offshore wind farm in the German Bight. The emphasis was optimising the shell thickness by exhausting the capacity of the fatigue and ultimate limit state for an individual location, the selection of the detail category and the buckling analysis method. The highest benefit was achieved by optimising the capacity of the fatigue and ultimate limit state for the monopile's location. A reduction of the dead weight up to 76% of the original mass could be reached. By only using better detail categories additional 7%, together with improved tolerances for the verification of buckling further 2% could be reached. Caused by the optimisation there is a change in the natural frequency and thus an impact on the loads. The loads must be adapted to the optimised construction. The most relevant measures have to be combined for a considerable reduction of the weight: In the end mass reductions up to approximately 25 % are possible. This can only be reached by extensive consultation between the owner of the offshore wind farm, the foundation designer and the turbine supplier. The aim of this communication is an integrated load calculation by one appointed designer binding for all parts of the design phase.

TI  - Blades optimization for an ocean current horizontal axis turbine using response surface methodology
AB  - Energy extraction from tidal currents using marine current turbines has been gaining attention in recent years. In this paper, the design and optimization of a horizontal axis turbine is proposed to harvest available ocean kinetic energy from very low flow regimes, area of application which was not previously addressed in the literature. Accordingly, a horizontal axis marine current turbine is modeled and NACA 4 series airfoils are selected as the two-dimensional blade airfoils design domain. Blade geometry and airfoil shape are then optimized using response surface and steepest ascend methodology. At the end, the correctness and accuracy of the proposed design is compared with the developed turbine blade element momentum theory model which is demonstrated to be in an acceptable range.

TI  - UK: Fledgling tidal industry on the rise
AB  - Marine Current Turbines' (MCT) SeaGen prototype project, operating at Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland, is able to operate at its 1.2 Mw capacity for the first time. This is the highest output achieved by a tidal stream anywhere in the world - the location boasts one of the world's fastest flowing tidal currents. The success of its turbine, which operates like a horizontal underwater windmill, hints at the potential of tidal power, which MCT hopes to commercialize more widely across the UK. The firm hopes to build farms of these turbines on other sites. In Northern Ireland, Thetis Energy, is considering an investment in tidal power, which could lead to a 100 Mw project. Another tidal project poised to move is a venture between engineering company Rolls-Royce and Tidal Generation, which is set to begin sea trials of a 0.5 Mw tidal-powered turbine in 2009, with a 1 Mw version planned for 2010. Finally, Tidal Energy is poised to carry out trials on a 1 Mw tidal turbine off the coast of Wales, which is due to become fully operational in 2010.

TI  - Imbalance Fault Classification Based on VMD Denoising and S-LDA for Variable-Speed Marine Current Turbine
AB  - Marine current energy as a kind of renewable energy has gradually attracted more and more attention from many countries. However, the blade imbalance fault of marine current turbines (MCTs) will have an effect on the power production efficiency and cause damage to the MCT system. It is hard to classify the severity of an MCT blade imbalance fault under the condition of the current instability and seafloor noise. This paper proposes a fault classification method based on the combination of variational mode decomposition denoising (VMD denoising) and screening linear discriminant analysis (S-LDA). The proposed method consists of three parts. Firstly, phase demodulation of the collected stator current signal is performed by the Hilbert transform (HT) method. Then, the obtained demodulation signal is denoised by variational mode decomposition denoising (VMD denoising), and the denoised signal is analyzed by power spectral density (PSD). Finally, S-LDA is employed on the power signal to determine the severities of fault classification. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experimental results under different severities of blade imbalance fault. The stator current signatures of experiments with different severities of blade imbalance fault are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The fault classification accuracy is 92.04\% based on the proposed method. Moreover, the experimental results verify that the influence of velocity fluctuation on fault classification can be eliminated.

TI  - Sensorless control of a power converter for a cluster of small wind turbines
AB  - This study presents a new sensorless control for small wind turbine clusters with a single power converter with a direct torque control algorithm. The proposed system consists of a wind farm connected to a back-to-back power converter that interfaces the wind farm with the AC grid. The studied wind turbines are based on fixed-speed wind turbines equipped with squirrel cage induction generators with individual pitch control. The presented structure permits to reduce the number of converters and allows to accomplish the grid codes (fault ride through capability and reactive power support). Furthermore, the generated active power can be reduced according to grid operator requirements. The presented control scheme can be applied to wind turbine repowering projects, wind farms connected to a microgrid, even, new small onshore and offshore power plants. The system performance and stability is studied and validated by means of dynamic simulations.

TI  - Grid-forming control strategies for black start by offshore wind power plants
AB  - Large-scale integration of renewable energy sources with power-electronic converters is pushing the power system closer to its dynamic stability limit. This has increased the risk of wide-area blackouts. Thus, the changing generation profile in the power system necessitates the use of alternate sources of energy such as wind power plants, to provide black-start services in the future. However, this requires grid-forming and not the traditionally prevalent grid-following wind turbines. This paper introduces the general working principle of grid-forming control and examines four of such control schemes. To compare their performance, a simulation study has been carried out for the different stages of energization of onshore load by a high-voltage direct-current (HVDC)-connected wind power plant. Their transient behaviour during transformer inrush, converter pre-charging and de-blocking, and onshore block-load pickup has been compared and analysed qualitatively to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each control strategy.

TI  - Concentrating solar power applied to EOR: High temperature fluid circulation for enhancing the recovery of heavy oil
AB  - Over the last decade there were new focuses for the use of renewable energies to enhance the recovery of fossil fuels in a cleaner and effective manner. In this paper a technical-economical feasibility study on the integration of Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) technology into the enhanced recovery of heavy oil from complex field by thermal method is reported. A hot fluid directly heated by solar energy is continuously circulated into a closed circuit through the reservoir to increase and sustain the reservoir temperature. The aim is to increase the potential production of unconventional reserves by lowering the oil viscosity. In the analyzed configuration, the closed loop is positioned in a heating well separated by the production well. Size and geometry of the circuit were optimized. A case study was chosen and the preliminary dimension and efficiency of the solar plant as well as the expected increases on oil production were estimated for different scenarios (different hot fluid temperatures, different percentages of the total thermal energy supplied by the solar resource). The results showed that it is possible to greatly enhance the recovery of heavy oil by this thermal method. Besides the estimated recovery is higher than those achievable by electrical heating as it is possible to reach very high temperatures (390Â°C) of the circulating oil. This thermal method represents also an efficient exploitation of the solar energy for EOR applications. From the economic point of view, the results are encouraging also if the comparison with a fossil solution is very sensitive to the location of the plant (different direct solar irradiance) and the gas price. As solar plant requires large land, for off-shore applications the described thermal method is suitable only if a fossil fuel is employed to heat the oil. Â© 2015 Society of Petroleum Engineers.

AB  - Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) can be an important source of renewable incremental base-load energy in the Caribbean. The islands with the exception of Trinidad have few conventional domestic energy resources and are therefore totally dependent on the availability of imported energy. Case studies for several locations are presented. These indicate the potential for application of 5-40 MWe OTEC plants. A preliminary cost analysis indicates that OTEC can be economically feasible in the Caribbean islands in the near term.

TI  - Simple wake models for tidal turbines in farm arrangement
AB  - From wind turbines it is known that the wake, induced by a turbine, has a negative impact on the energy production of downstream devices. Basically, the wake is a zone with reduced velocity behind a turbine. Further downstream, the velocity recovers gradually by turbulent mixing with the ambient flow. In order to optimize the design of a tidal farm, the aim of this paper is to find simple relations that can be used to predict the energy output of a given farm configuration. The energy output of a turbine depends on its inflow velocity. Therefore, the strategy is to find a model that is able to predict the velocity field in the tidal farm. Such 'wake models' exist already for wind turbines and thruster- thruster interaction. In this research, the applicability of these wake models to tidal turbines is investigated by comparing their results to reference data of tidal turbines. Only limited measurement data for tidal turbines are available; therefore a CFD model of a tidal turbine is used to generate the reference data. The velocity in the wake is simulated for different conditions with the CFD model. The CFD model is validated with the available data in the literature. The velocity in the wake for a single turbine is predicted accurately for different initial conditions. Modeling of the turbulence showed some discrepancies in the far wake, consequently the wake of turbines in farm configurations is predicted less accurate. Three wake models, selected from the literature, are compared to the CFD simulations of the wake behind a single turbine. The wind turbine wake model of Jensen performed best; the velocity in the wake is calculated accurate for different situations. Mutual interaction of wakes will occur inside tidal farms. Several methods from wind turbines theory are used to estimate the velocity in interaction situations. Three basic situations of wake interaction are distinguished: tandem operation, wake interference and overlapping inflow. The interaction methods are tested with CFD reference data for each situation separately. Most methods compared reasonably well; the most suitable interaction methods are selected. A small tidal farm case study is performed to test the combination of wake model and interaction methods. The flow in the cluster of 5 turbines is predicted satisfactorily by the wake model for different inflow velocities. All results indicate that the principle of applying wind turbine wake models to tidal turbine has good potential. However the number of test cases conducted in the thesis is limited and the incorrect turbulence modeling of the CFD model caused some uncertainties for multiple turbine situation.

TI  - Can renewable generation, energy storage and energy efficient technologies enable carbon neutral energy transition?
AB  - Energy system decarbonization has been a critical measure to combat climate change, and an optimization framework modelling this process would facilitate designing cost-effective energy transition pathways. In this study, a bottom-up optimization framework for energy transitions is developed, which bridges the decarbonization processes for the power sector and the space heating sector, while considering energy system stability, climate targets and scheduled system changes. Our results show that the decarbonization goals of New York State are feasible for electricity and space heating energy system. By 2050, Offshore wind would be the main electricity source that generates 66% of power, while air source heat pumps and geothermal technologies would provide 47% and 41% of heat demands, respectively. It is also discussed how the results can facilitate developing energy transition policies regarding carbon price and geothermal technologies. Our findings reveal the feasibility of carbon neutral energy transition using renewable generation, energy storage, and energy-efficient technologies. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - An innovative tank testing method to efficiently characterise wave energy converters. (Septembre 2021)
AB  - Tank testing is an integral part of wave energy converter (WEC) development. It allows the development team to gather data about their concept early in the development cycle before having sophisticated simulation tools, and the assumptions and limitations of tank testing are different from the ones required by hydrodynamic modelling. The tank testing objective are traditionally reached using a combination of simple regular waves to characterise the device, and realistic irregular waves which replicate conditions close to future deployment environment. Characterising the device behaviour requires either multiple regular wave runs, and the frequency resolution of irregular seas required to provide realistic characteristics is such that it imposes long tank runs. Both methods are time consuming and limiting when the objective is to quickly sieve through numerous device configurations. This article presents an innovative sea state, Ir0, dedicated to characterise efficiently WEC configurations. It was tested during the Seaturns tests at the Aalborg basin in February 2020. Composed of 25 components, Ir0 has a waveheight HS = 2.1 m and a period TE = 10.0 s at equivalent full scale. At tank scale, Ir0 has a repeat period of 256 s only, allowing for quick testing and multiple repetitions. The Response Amplitude Operators are obtained from regular waves testing and Ir0 and are compared to the device behaviour in irregular waves. It shows that the Ir0 is accurate and provide a truthful characterisation of the concept. Ir0 was used to characterise 51 configurations during the two weeks testing.

Although there are several types of wavepower generation systems, such as an attenuator and an overtopping device, these have problems related to frequent damages or limited applicable area. This study is concerned with development of a new hybrid wave-power system, which is expected to provide higher power efficiency than the previous system, and experimental and numerical estimations on performance of the new system. The proposed wave power absorber is composed of a generator embedded in the floating shield cylinder, pendulum plate to accelerate rotation of generator, self-dynamic positioning devices, and a support column to fix the entire power generation system to the seabed. To determine major design parameters and to conduct a specific concept design of the proposed power generation system, hydrodynamic tests of the floating shield cylinder were carried out. The cylinder was scaled with a scale factor 0.12. Several test specimens were fabricated to examine effects of the following physical characteristics on the system performance: draft depth of the cylinder, diameter of the cylinder, longitudinal projective area of the cylinder, a number of blades attached on the cylinder, blade length. Each specimen was subjected to 8 regular and 4 irregular wave loads for 5 minutes; an extreme water wave condition was also included. In the hydrodynamic tests, rotation numbers of the cylinder per a minute were measured. Although consistent patterns of the angular velocity of the cylinder was not observed from the experimental results, the results showed that the ratio of draft depth to diameter mainly effects on the angular velocity of the cylinder, and that the cylinder quickly rotates at the crest of an incident wave while it inversely and slowly rotates at the through. Furthermore, to supplement the above tests and to analyze mechanical behaviors of the support system, numerical simulations of the system were also conducted. To calculate water pressure on the cylinder and the support column, the commercial computational program ANSYS AQWA was used. The distribution and the magnitude of the predicted water pressure were then mapped into the finite element model of the cylinder and the support structure to examine the structural responses and stability against overturning.

TI  - Performance of a direct-driven wave energy point absorber with high inertia rotatory power take-off
AB  - An alternating rotatory generator using an eddy current break is developed as a physical scale model of a direct-driven floating point absorber power take-off (PTO) for wave tank tests. It is shown that this design is a simple and cost-effective way to get an accurate linear damping PTO. The device shows some beneficial characteristics, making it an interesting option for full scale devices: For similar weights the inertia can be significantly higher than for linear generators, allowing it to operate with natural frequencies close to typical wave frequencies. The influence of the higher inertia on the power absorption is tested using both a numerical simulation and physical wave tank tests. With the increased inertia the PTO is able to absorb more than double the energy of a comparable direct-driven linear generator in some sea states. Moreover, the alternating rotatory generator allows the absorption characteristic to be tuned by changing the inertia and the generator damping. Â© 2018 by the authors.

TI  - Designing of a Pelamis wave energy converter in Matlab Simulink and studying the output characteristics with variation to electrical and mechanical parameters
AB  - To address the energy crisis in near future, energy should not only be sensibly used but also novel energy production schemes need to be proposed. Traditional plants based on hydro power and fossil fuels are not enough to meet the future energy demand. Despite the fact that nuclear energy can fulfill the demand, it has adverse effects which are harmful to the environment. Our main concern is to use a renewable energy source which has high potentiality such as ocean wave to produce power. This work deals with the working principle of an ocean wave energy converter called 'Pelamis'. The focus of our work is the analysis of generated power of the 'Pelamis' with the variation of input wave force on its surface, capacitive VAR hydraulic fluid by creating a simplified model using 'Simulink' software.

TI  - The role of natural gas in facilitating the transition to renewable electricity generation in South Africa
AB  - As is being done in most of the world, South Africa has commenced the transition from a fossil fuel-based electricity generation system to one based on renewable sources to meet greenhouse gas emission reduction goals. This paper explores the role of natural gas in South Africa to support the transition to a renewable energy-driven power grid. Specifically, the paper quantifies the firm and dispatchable power requirement to accommodate variability in solar and wind generation sources based on real-time series data from current renewable energy power plants for the country, and demonstrates that natural gas could be one of the ele-ments to meet the medium-term need for this dispatchable power requirement, based on current regional gas resources. A range of alternative natural gas sources are considered in this analysis, covering existing gas resources from Mozambique, deep-water offshore potential from the southern Cape, shale gas from the Ka-roo basin, as well as liquefied natural gas imports. In addition, the alternatives to natural gas to supply the required dispatchable energy are considered. The analysis shows that the major challenge is to have sufficient gas storage available to be able to provide gas at the very high instantaneous rates required, but where the gas is only used for short periods of time and at low annual rates Â© 2022, Journal of Energy in Southern Africa.All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Constructive interference effects for tidal turbine arrays
AB  - The performance benefits of deploying tidal turbines in close side-by-side proximity to exploit constructive interference effects are demonstrated experimentally using two 1.2 m diameter turbines. The turbines are arrayed side-by-side at 1/4 diameter tip-to-tip spacing, and their performance compared with that of a single rotor. Tests were completed in the 25 m diameter, 2 m deep wave and current FloWave Ocean Energy Research facility. A detailed assessment of inflow conditions at different control points is used to understand the impact that rotors, designed for high blockage conditions, have on the approach flow. After accounting for global blockage, a 10.8 \% uplift in the twin-turbine-averaged power coefficient, relative to that for a single turbine, is found for the turbine design speed, at the expense of a 5.2 \% increase in thrust coefficient and 3.1 \% increase in tip-speed-ratio. Flowfield mapping demonstrated flow effects at array and device scale including array bypass flows and jetting between turbines. Azimuthal variation of blade root flapwise and edgewise bending moments show that the turbines interact in a beneficial manner, with additional and sustained loading peaks as the blades pass in close proximity to the neighbouring rotor. Peak performance for the twin turbines occurred at a higher tip-speed-ratio than for the single turbine, which is consistent with the twin turbines exerting a higher thrust on the flow to achieve maximum power. The twin turbine performance variation with tip-speed-ratio is found to be more gradual than for the single turbine. Using differential rotor speed control we observe that array performance is robust to small differences in neighbouring rotor operating point. Through these experiments we demonstrate that there is a substantial, achievable performance benefit from closely arraying turbines for side-by-side operation and designing them for constructive interference.

TI  - Assessing the cumulative environmental effects of marine renewable energy developments: Establishing common ground
AB  - Assessing and managing the cumulative impacts of human activities on the environment remains a major challenge to sustainable development. This challenge is highlighted by the worldwide expansion of marine renewable energy developments (MREDs) in areas already subject to multiple activities and climate change. Cumulative effects assessments in theory provide decision makers with adequate information about how the environment will respond to the incremental effects of licensed activities and are a legal requirement in many nations. In practise, however, such assessments are beset by uncertainties resulting in substantial delays during the licensing process that reduce MRED investor confidence and limit progress towards meeting climate change targets. In light of these targets and ambitions to manage the marine environment sustainably, reducing the uncertainty surrounding MRED effects and cumulative effects assessment are timely and vital. This review investigates the origins and evolution of cumulative effects assessment to identify why the multitude of approaches and pertinent research have emerged, and discusses key considerations and challenges relevant to assessing the cumulative effects of MREDs and other activities on ecosystems. The review recommends a shift away from the current reliance on disparate environmental impact assessments and limited strategic environmental assessments, and a move towards establishing a common system of coordinated data and research relative to ecologically meaningful areas, focussed on the needs of decision makers tasked with protecting and conserving marine ecosystems and services.

TI  - Atmospheric Impacts on Power Curves of Multi-Megawatt Offshore Wind Turbines
AB  - Power curves for offshore wind turbines within the German offshore wind farm alpha yentas were derived based on the IEC standard. Binning in groups of shear and turbulence intensity as measures of atmospheric stability were performed. The derived power curves show a strong dependency on these two parameters. Differences of up to 15 \% in power output between unstable and stable stratification in the non-wake case occur. For wind turbines within the wake of others the effects are even more pronounced. Here, the differences in power production between the stability classes approach 20 \%. This dependency of the power curves on stability can cause significant miscalculations of instantaneous power production, long-term energy yield and loads. Parameters other than the hub height wind speed are often not taken into account in state-of-the-art wind power forecasts. This can lead to substantial over- or underestimation of the resulting power.

TI  - Diagnosis Methods on the Blade of Marine Current Turbine
AB  - The global energy crisis has allowed marine currents to enter the field of vision of all countries. Marine current turbine (MCT) is a kind of deep-sea equipment that converts marine current energy into electric power, and its safe and reliable operation is very important. In order to facilitate monitoring of the blade status of MCTs in multiple scenarios, the chapter deals with the diagnosis method of MCT blade followed by different methods. First, a review of the MCT blade fault diagnosis method has been presented. Then two different methods are discussed in this chapter. One is the signal processing method based on the stator current, which includes VMD denoising and proposed novel LDA classifier; the another one is the image semantic segmentation technique based on the MCT image, which includes semantic segmentation and adaptive recognition technical. These two methods can be organically combined under different biofouling cases. When the biofouling is low to affect the output torque of the turbine, the method based on image processing can be useful. On the contrary, the method based on current signal is more convenient and effective. The experimental results show that the two methods proposed in this chapter can effectively detect MCT biofouling in different scenarios. It also proposes several trends for a handle with biofouling problem in conclusion. Â© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Design of a Three-Phase Series Resonant Converter for Offshore DC Grids
AB  - Offshore wind farms for the generation of electrical power is an ongoing discussion for several years. A major challenge today is to reduce the cost for the electrification of these large scale wind farms. A possible solution is to use a DC collector grid instead of conventional AC systems. However, to realize this, high-power DC/DC converters are needed to transform the voltages within the grid. The Series Resonant Converter, which will be discussed in this paper offers a possible solution that is efficient and cost effective. First, the fundamentals on three-phase SRC systems are discussed, before the soft-switching characteristics of high-power semiconductors are discussed and measurement results are presented. Next, a modified topology of the SRC is presented allowing an asymmetric hi-directional power How which is essential for the usage in offshore wind farms. Finally, the total efficiency of the converter will be determined for different frequencies.

TI  - Numerical study of a concept for major repair and replacement of offshore wind turbine blades
AB  - Repair and replacement of offshore wind turbine blades are necessary for current and future offshore wind turbines. To date, repair activities are often conducted using huge jack-up crane vessels and by applying a reverse installation procedure. Because of the high costs associated with installation and removal of offshore wind turbine components and the low profit margin of the offshore wind industry, alternative methods for installation and removal are needed. This paper introduces a novel concept for replacement or installation of offshore wind turbine blades. The concept involves a medium-sized jack-up crane vessel and a tower climbing mechanism. This mechanism provides a stable platform for clamping, lowering, and lifting of a blade. A case study of a 5-MW offshore wind turbine is shown, where common engineering practices were applied and numerical simulations of the marine operations were carried out using finite element and multibody simulation tools. Operational limits for wave and wind actions were established to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the proposed concept. Â© 2020 The Authors. Wind Energy published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Power: UK: More than hot air
AB  - According to a new government plant, UK's domestic power needs could be supplied from offshore wind-power by 2020. Business secretary John Hutton announced plans for â‰¤ 25 Gw of offshore wind-power capacity in addition to 8 Gw of capacity that was already planned, as it attempts to steer the country towards the EU target of producing 20% of its energy from renewables by the end of the next decade. Under the plan, almost all of the UK's continental shelf would be opened to wind development in a third round of licensing. UK offshore wind capacity, of just under 400 Mw, should soon rise, as several large projects are completed, helping the country surpass Denmark as the world's largest offshore wind generator. However, doubts have been raised over whether the government's aspirations can be turned into reality. These include concerns on the limited supply of turbines, and the lack of skilled technicians able to set up offshore wind farms.

TI  - Potential impact of the Massachusetts maritime academy wind turbine on common (Sterna hirundo) and roseate (S-dougallii) terns
AB  - Massachusetts Maritime Academy (MMA) conducted a study to evaluate the potential impact of the MMA wind turbine (Vestas V47-660 kW) on birds, including common terns (Sterna hirundo), which are protected at the state level, and roseate (S. dougalii) terns, which are protected at the federal level. We found that common terns were relatively abundant on the water adjacent to the wind turbine, especially during the post-breeding period (7 Aug-30 Sep). Roseate terns, however, were much less abundant than common terns, and their presence at the study site was nearly limited to the chick-rearing period (19 Jun-6 Aug). Both species were least abundant during the nesting period (24 Apr-18 Jun). During the study, we observed 253 terns passing through wind turbine airspace (i.e., within 50 m of the wind turbine). Most (n = 226) were common terns, 1 was a roseate tern, and 16 were unidentified to the species level. Terns (all categories) were most abundant in wind airspace during the chick-rearing period, especially during morning hours (0530-1100). However, their abundance was dependent upon the operational status of the wind turbine rotor. Terns were less abundant in wind turbine airspace when the rotor velocity was >1 rpm than when the rotor velocity was <1 rpm. The few terns that did enter wind turbine airspace when the rotor was operating usually avoided altitudes equal to the rotor-swept region. We found one bird carcass (a laughing gull, Larus atricilla) suspected of colliding with the wind turbine rotor. After correcting for scavenging activity and searcher efficiency, we estimated that the wind turbine probably contributes to 2.15 avian fatalities per year. This rate is approximately average relative to wind turbines elsewhere.

TI  - The Assessment of Overvoltage protection Within Energization of Offshore Wind Farms
AB  - The beneficiary of Offshore Wind Farms (OWF) to land wind farms in the sense of more power productivity and land view disturbance leads to more investment and consideration. Nevertheless, the maintenance of OWFs is a significant issue due to accessibility and repair costs. Thus, the protection of OWFs electrical components should be investigated in various operation conditions such as energization, deenergization as well as lightning strikes to the blade of wind turbines. In this paper, the overvoltages due to energization are simulated and the impact of surge arresters and capacitive filters to protect wind turbine components is analyzed. Modeling of the components in OWF is considered based upon their frequency behavior. The significant components for energization studies are interconnecting cables, Wind Turbine Transformers (WTTs), surge arresters, vacuum circuit breakers as well. For modeling the cables, JMarti model is applied and model frequency is modified based on cable length. WTTs as the heart of wind farms are modeled based on vector fitting and transformer terminal measurements. Surge arresters as the main overvoltage protector is modeled considering stray lead inductances which degrade the efficiency of the surges arresters in reality. Simulation results indicate that energizing a row of OWF is actually similar to a ladder cables-transformers energization which LV terminal of transformers should be considered no load. The overvoltages in LV can reach up to 10-15 p.u. if surge arresters and capacitive filters are not installed. By the application of surge arresters and capacitive filters, the overvoltage peak and rate of rise of overvoltage (dU/dt) can be respectively controlled. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - An evaluation of the wave energy resources in the proximity of the wind farms operating in the North Sea
AB  - The objective of the present work is to assess the wave power in the North Sea in the vicinity of the most relevant wind farms that are operating there. At this moment, the coastal environment of the North Sea is among the most significant areas in the world from the point of view of harvesting marine renewable energy. Furthermore, this area is also very relevant for offshore activities related to oil and gas extraction. From this perspective, its coastal environment would be a perfect candidate for the implementation of the wave projects, which would benefit from existing infrastructure. The ERA5 dataset has been considered for the evaluation of the wave power for the 30-year period (1989â€“2018). 10 reference points have been defined in the coastal environment of the sea covering the most relevant locations and for them, the mean wave power has been first assessed. After this, the seasonal and monthly variability of the wave power have been also evaluated together with some statistical parameters. The results show that the northern part of the sea has relatively significant wave energy resources and it can be a viable candidate for implementation of the future wave projects. However, the linear trends indicate a slight tendency of decrease of the wave power, but on the other hand, the coefficient of resource variation has small values. Finally, a comparison with the satellite data provided by the European Space Agency is also carried out for the 27-year period 1992-2018. While in general there is a very good concordance between the two datasets, for the reference points located in the north-eastern part of the sea, which are the most resourceful locations, the satellite data indicate higher values.

TI  - Floating offshore wind turbine aerodynamics: Trends and future challenges
AB  - Offshore wind turbines present novel challenges to the field of rotor aerodynamics because of complex behaviours associated with six degrees of freedom motions of the platform. The number of scientific articles on these specific issues has been steadily increasing during the past ten years, reflecting the criticality of aerodynamics to overcome the specific barriers in this area. In this work, we aim to comprehensively review the present literature in order to identify the existing knowledge gaps in this field of research and provide an outlook for future directions. This paper is not purely about aerodynamics as an isolated element of floating offshore wind turbine science. Rather, due to the multi-physics nature of the system, we emphasise the current trends in aerodynamics in relation to other fields such as platform hydrodynamics and control. Critical analysis of the literature reveals that the most common approaches are to study the problem in a coupled or uncoupled manner. The latter is generally done by prescribing platform motions. The existing literature has been so far mainly focused on an isolated solo floating turbine and the studies on the interactions between the floating turbines are scarce. These trends are critically assessed in order to provide the reader with a holistic overview of the current direction. We also present six major challenges in order to provide a future perspective of the existing research opportunities in floating offshore wind turbine aerodynamics. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Islanding detection method for DFIG wind turbines using artificial neural networks
AB  - A new passive method of islanding detection is proposed for a wind farm power generation system using artificial neural network. The proposed method is based on the voltage and current measurements and processing of these signals with a Fourier transform to find the second harmonic. Then, the symmetrical components of the second harmonic of voltage and current signals measured at the wind farm side are used to feed an artificial neural network (ANN). The proposed artificial neural network is used through different environments of power quality to identify whether the abnormity at the point of common coupling (PCC) is a power quality disturbance or an actual islanding operation. The results show that the proposed islanding detection method is able to detect islanding operation very fast in an efficient way. Finally, Matlab/Simulink is employed for this purpose.

TI  - Acceleration-based fault-tolerant control design of offshore fixed wind turbines
AB  - Wind turbines (WTs) are basically controlled by varying the generator load torque (with the so-called torque control) and the blade pitch angles (with the so-called pitch control) based on measurement of the generator shaft speed. These two controllers unitedly work to satisfy the control objectives, and it is crucial that they are tolerant to possible faults in the WT system. Passive fault-tolerant control comprises the design of robust controllers against disturbances and uncertainties. This enables the controller to counteract the effect of a fault without requiring reconfiguration or fault detection. In this regard, the main contribution of this paper is to propose new control techniques that not only provide fault tolerance capabilities to the WT system but also improve the overall performance of the system in both fault-free and faulty conditions. Coupling nonlinear aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulations of an offshore WT with jacket platform is carried out for several pitch actuator faults. The jacket platform motions and structural loads caused by fault events with the proposed controllers are compared with loads encountered during normal operation and with respect to a well-known baseline controller in the literature. The proposed controllers are based in the super-twisting algorithm by using feedback of the generator shaft speed as well as the fore-aft and side-to-side acceleration signals of the WT tower.

TI  - Future for offshore wind energy in the United Kingdom: The way forward
AB  - The majority of our energy demand is satisfied by the combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and gas. This has resulted in our fossil fuel resources being vastly reduced and has increased the carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere which is causing global warming. The 2020 European Union (EU) targets have been set out to promote the use of renewable technologies and reduce the electricity demand. From the reviewed literature, it was acknowledged that most of these renewable forms of energy sources were initially capital intensive to construct but once constructed they had low operating costs, paying themselves of over their lifecycle. In this study, primary research was undertaken by means of a case study and structured interviews. The case study formed a background to the UKs current and planned offshore wind installations. The results of the interviews were analysed using the NVIVO qualitative software analysis package. This identified themes within the data which allowed them to be analysed and evaluated. The primary data results concluded that the EU targets were challenging but achievable and that the UK government was very supportive in pushing for these targets. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Characterization of the vertical evolution of the three-dimensional turbulence for fatigue design of tidal turbines
AB  - A system of two coupled four-beam acoustic Doppler current profilers was used to collect turbulence measurements over a 36-h period at a highly energetic tidal energy site in Alderney Race. This system enables the evaluation of the six components of the Reynolds stress tensor throughout a large proportion of the water column. The present study provides mean vertical profiles of the velocity, the turbulence intensity and the integral lengthscale along the streamwise, spanwise and vertical direction of the tidal current. Based on our results and considering a tidal-stream energy convertor (TEC) aligned with the current main direction, the main elements of turbulence prone to affect the structure (material fatigue) and to alter power generation would likely be: (i) the streamwise turbulence intensity (I-x), (ii) the shear stress, vw ` <overbar></mml:mover>, (iii) the normal stress, u<mml:mo>' 2<mml:mo accent={''}false{''}><overbar></mml:mover> and (iv) the vertical integral lengthscale (L-z). The streamwise turbulence intensity, (I-x), was found to be higher than that estimated at other tidal energy sites across the world for similar height above bottom. Along the vertical direction, the length (L-z) of the large-scale turbulence eddies was found to be equivalent to the rotor diameter of the TEC Sabella D10. It is considered that the turbulence metrics presented in this paper will be valuable for TECs designers, helping them optimize their designs as well as improve loading prediction through the lifetime of the machines.

TI  - SOLAR POWER GENERATOR CUTS OFFSHORE OPERATING COST.
AB  - Solar cells, or photovoltaic systems, discussed in the article can be defined simply as semiconductor devices that convert light directly into electricity. Best known are the silicon solar cells that can develop 0. 4 to 0. 5 v, 0. 5 amp. For practical reasons individual cells are mounted in the module form with five cells in series, giving a basic power package of nominal 2. 5 volts, 0. 5 amp capacity, in typical oil field situations. The main advantage of a solar generator is its ability to operate unattended for long periods of time. Offshore, where transportation and time are expensive, this is a big factor. However, an attractive payout can also be estimated from extrapolated savings in batteries alone.

TI  - Design and testing of a model scale mccabe wave pump
AB  - Alternate sources of energy are a rapidly growing field of interest in engineering. Renewable energy sources such as wave, wind, and current are of particular interest. With the ocean covering over 70% of the earth, it remains a largely untouched source of power for electricity. This project specifically focuses on wave energy. There are many new technologies that have been proposed for wave energy conversion. However, all of these technologies are in the developmental stage. Some of the most promising technologies include terminators, attenuators, point absorbers, and overtopping devices. In this project, an attenuator design will be examined. Attenuators are multi-segmented floating structures which are oriented parallel to the direction of the wave travel. As the wave travels along the length of the attenuator, the device flexes thus converting the wave energy to electricity. The McCabe Wave Pump (MWP) and the Pelamis are examples of two such devices. At this time, no attenuator design produces electricity at a rate or efficiency which makes them economically feasible power alternatives for most regions of the world. This project will consider modifications of the MWP in order to improve on the devices efficiency. Copyright Â© 2013 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).

TI  - Coordinated DC fault ride-through control strategy for offshore wind farm interconnection with flexible HVDC
AB  - More and more offshore wind farms are connected to main grid with flexible HVDC in recent years. However, Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) based on traditional half-bridge sub-module cannot suppress DC fault current because of its topological limitation. When pole-to-pole DC fault occurs, general strategy such as blocking IGBTs or tripping AC breaker will cause wind farm shedding from system. To solve the problem, a coordinated control strategy was proposed based on hybrid sub-module MMC containing half-bridge sub-module and full-bridge sub-module. The strategy controls DC voltage to suppress fault current during pole-to-pole DC fault. In order to keep power flow balance, offshore wind farm power flow limits would change according to flexible HVDC's DC voltage. The proposed strategy could ride through DC fault without blocking IGBTs, while keeping capacitor voltage stable. Finally, feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method were verified with MATLAB/SIMULINK simulation. Â© 2016, Power System Technology Press. All right reserved.

TI  - Modeling extreme weather events for offshore wind in the North Sea: A sensitivity analysis to physics parameterizations in WRF
AB  - Extreme weather events such as storms, cold fronts, and mesoscale convective systems, are capable of producing extreme and sudden precipitation, strong wind gusts and fast changes in wind direction, which are potentially harmful for the operation, power production and maintenance of wind farms. This study aims to provide insight into the modelling of three such events for the offshore wind farms located in the Belgian North Sea. This work extends the ongoing work on generalizing WRF model sensitivities to multiple extreme weather events. This sensitivity analysis considers three cases consisting of Storm Ciara, a low-pressure system and a cold front. These events are modeled using five model setups comprising different combinations of WRF physics parameterizations. The simulated wind direction and speed are evaluated against 10-min averaged SCADA data. The results indicate no single best model setup to accurately simulate all events. The combination of physical parameterization is observed to play a major role in model sensitivities. The use of scale-aware physical parameterization show potential for better performance but is heavily influenced by the combination of model physics and the type of event. No conclusive set of inferences are obtained from a qualitative evaluation of precipitation against observed radar data. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Numerical analysis of aero-hydrodynamic responses of floating offshore wind turbine considering blade deformation
AB  - With the increasing of rated power of offshore wind turbines, the blade is becoming longer and slender. This leads to the significant structural deformation of the wind turbine blade and further make the aerodynamic responses of offshore wind turbines unsteady. Moreover, the change in wind turbine aerodynamics will alter the coupled performance of floating offshore wind turbines because of strong interference effects between the wind turbine and the floating platform. In the present work, a coupled aero-hydrodynamic analysis model for floating offshore wind turbines considering blade deformation is established. The actuator line technique is applied to calculate the aerodynamic loads and reproduce the turbine wake. The structural dynamic equations and the finite element method are used to obtain the blade deformation. Coupling effects between the aerodynamic responses of wind turbine and the structural deformation of blade are taken into consideration. In addition, the hydrodynamic responses of floating platform and mooring system are predicted by in-house CFD code naoe-FOAM-SJTU. The aeroelastic module is firstly validated by the previous numerical results. Then coupled aero-hydrodynamic responses of a spar-type floating offshore wind turbine under combined wind-wave loads are analyzed in detail using the proposed analysis model. It is found that the average aerodynamic loads including rotor power and thrust decrease and the fluctuation amplitude of aerodynamic power increases when the blade deformation is considered. The blade deformation shows small effects on the wake velocity, while it has significant effects on the blade structural bending moments.

TI  - Satellite data for the offshore renewable energy sector: Synergies and innovation opportunities
AB  - Can satellite data be used to address challenges currently faced by the Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) sector? What benefit can satellite observations bring to resource assessment and maintenance of ORE farms? Can satellite observations be used to assess the environmental impact of offshore renewables leading towards a more sustainable ORE sector? This review paper faces these questions presenting a holistic view of the current interactions between satellite and ORE sectors, and future needs to make this partnership grow. The aim of the work is to start the conversation between these sectors by establishing a common ground. We present offshore needs and satellite technology limitations, as well as potential opportunities and areas of growth. To better understand this, the reader is guided through the history, current developments, challenges and future of offshore wind, tidal and wave energy technologies. Then, an overview on satellite observations for ocean applications is given, covering types of instruments and how they are used to provide different metocean variables, satellite performance, and data processing and integration. Past, present and future satellite missions are also discussed. Finally, the paper focuses on innovation opportunities and the potential of synergies between the ORE and satellite sectors. Specifically, we pay attention to improvements that satellite observations could bring to standard measurement techniques: assessing uncertainty, wind, tidal and wave conditions forecast, as well as environmental monitoring from space. Satelliteâ€“enabled measurement of ocean physical processes and applications for fisheries, mammals and birds, and habitat change, are also discussed in depth. Â© 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Fundamentals applicable to the utilisation of marine current turbines for energy production
AB  - The potential of electric power generation from marine tidal currents is enormous. Tidal currents are being recognised as a resource to be exploited for the sustainable generation of electrical power. The high load factors resulting from the fluid properties and the predictable resource characteristics make marine currents particularly attractive for power generation and advantageous when compared to other renewables. There is a paucity of information regarding various key aspects of system design encountered in this new area of research. Virtually no work has been done to determine the characteristics of turbines running in water for kinetic energy conversion even though relevant work has been carried out on ship's propellers, wind turbines and on hydro turbines. None of these three well established areas of technology completely overlap with this new field so that gaps remain in the state of knowledge. This paper reviews the fundamental issues that are likely to play a major role in implementation of MCT systems. It also highlights research areas to be encountered in this new area. The paper reports issues such as the harsh marine environment, the phenomenon of cavitation, and the high stresses encountered by such structures are likely to play a major role on the work currently being undertaken in this field.

TI  - Experimental investigation on wake and thrust characteristics of a twin-rotor horizontal axis tidal stream turbine
AB  - Study on the performance of the tidal stream turbines could greatly improve tidal stream energy development. Up to date, few studies about the twin-rotor horizontal axis tidal turbines (TRHATTs) are available. In this study, laboratory experiments with a range of approaching flow velocity and yaw angles are conducted to investigate the wake structures in the lee side of the turbine. The experimental results show that there are three `rod-liked' wakes behind the turbine, which merge into one wake further downstream. Increase of the approaching flow velocity can accelerate wake velocity recovery and enhances turbulence intensity. Correspondingly, the thrust and the fluctuation of thrust also increase. When the turbine is subjected to the yawed inflow, one side of the near wake mixing accelerates and the turbulence intensity distribution becomes asymmetric. The study shows that the thrust is slightly reduced with an increase of the yaw angle, and reaches the maximum when the yaw angle is 40 degrees. Fluctuation range of the thrust increases with the increase of the yaw angle, and starts to decrease when the yaw angle exceeds 30 degrees. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Optimal Operation Voltage for Maximal Power Transfer Capability on Very Long HVAC Cables
AB  - An analytical approach towards the operation of very long HVAC cables has been developed. The main physical phenomena have been expressed with simplified analytical equations. A comparison with numerical simulations has shown acceptable accuracy. A set of long distance cable parameters has been introduced. The main conclusion is that beyond a certain specific cable length, the operation voltage should be optimised rather than set to the rated voltage value. Operation at the power factor fx1 has been found to be optimal with regards and power transmission capability. The developed equations can help to gain a better understanding of the subject matter, and the introduced long distance parameters enable to easily compare the long distance capabilities of different cables. It is concluded, that for very long HVAC cable projects, it makes sense to consider cables with very high voltage rating, even though they might not be operated at rated voltage. Such cables can be beneficial due to their thicker insulation layer resulting in lower capacitance. The results also highlight the importance of HVAC cables with low capacitance for very long distance applications, which might lead to a new niche market of specialised cables. Â© 2016 The Authors.

TI  - The role of tidal asymmetry in characterizing the tidal energy resource of Orkney
AB  - When selecting sites for marine renewable energy projects, there are a wide range of economical and practical constraints to be considered, from the magnitude of the resource through to proximity of grid connections. One factor that is not routinely considered in tidal energy site selection, yet which has an important role in quantifying the resource, is tidal asymmetry, i.e. variations between the flood and ebb phases of the tidal cycle. Here, we present theory and develop a high-resolution three-dimensional ROMS tidal model of Orkney to examine net power output for a range of sites along an energetic channel with varying degrees of tidal asymmetry. Since power output is related to velocity cubed, even small asymmetries in velocity lead to substantial asymmetries in power output. We also use the 3D model to assess how tidal asymmetry changes with height above the bed, i.e. representing different device hub heights, how asymmetry affects turbulence properties, and how asymmetry is influenced by wind-driven currents. Finally, although there is minimal potential for tidal phasing over our study site, we demonstrate that regions of opposing flood- versus ebb-dominant asymmetry occurring over short spatial scales can be aggregated to provide balanced power generation over the tidal cycle.

TI  - The Effectiveness of Development Bamboo Biomass Power Plant (Case Study: Siberut Island, the District of Mentawai Islands)
AB  - Electricity has an important role to improve economy in a region. However, currently, part of the people Indonesia still have lack access electricity, especially those in the backward, outer, and advance areas (called 3T in Indonesia mean tertinggal, terluar, dan terdepan), that one of which is in uninhabited islands. Increasing the target of the electrification ratio in the regions, Government of Indonesia has responsibility to power that area. One of ways is to work with private parties to build renewable energy power plant by utilizing the potential of local natural resources. The development of power plant in Siberut Island, West Sumatera utilizes bamboo resources in the local area. This development will be done by private parties in three villages namely Madobag, Matotoan Village in South Siberut District, and Saliguma Village in Central Siberut District.

TI  - Numerical simulation of the loading characteristics of straight and helical-bladed vertical axis tidal turbines
AB  - The stress and deflection of straight and helical-bladed vertical axis turbines was investigated using hydrodynamic and structural analysis models. Using Double Multiple Streamtube (DMS) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models, the hydrodynamic forces and pressures on the turbines were modelled for three rotational rates from startup to over speed conditions. The results from these hydrodynamic models were then used to determine stress and total deflection levels using beam theory and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) methods. Maximum stress and deflection levels were found when the blades were in the furthest upstream region, with the highest stresses found at the blade-strut joints for the turbines studied. The helical turbine exhibited on average 13% lower maximum stress levels than the straight-bladed turbine, due to the helical distribution of the blades around the rotational axis. All simulation models offered similar accuracy when predicting maximum blade stress and deflection levels; however for detailed analysis of the blade-strut joints the more computationally demanding CFD-FEA models were required. Straight-bladed, rather than helical turbines, are suggested to be more suited for tidal installations, as for the same turbine frontal area they produce higher power output with only 13% greater structural stress loading.

TI  - Capacity Value of Wave Power
AB  - Although wave power installations are currently limited in number, the capacity value of wave power is of interest in power system planning. The capacity value of wind power has been studied in previous work, but the value for wave power is not known. Continuous time series characterizing the wave energy resource at multiple sites are generated from raw wave data. These time series are analyzed with a forced outage rate imposed for individual devices, as may be encountered by real wave energy farms. The capacity value of wave power at various sites is evaluated with reference to 500 MW of installed capacity. Portfolios are created, allocating wave power capacity to individual sites, with the impact of geographical aggregation being examined. The inter-annual variation for each portfolio is then determined in order to examine the robustness of the results. Comparison is also made between sites off the west coasts of Ireland and Portugal. The implications for the power system resulting from an increase in generation adequacy are discussed.

TI  - Topology design for collector systems of offshore wind farms with pure DC power systems
AB  - This paper presents an analytical design method for the dc collector systems of offshore wind farms and proposes an improved topology to overcome the limitations of the conventional series-parallel (SP) topology. During a severe failure in the SP topology, bypassing the faulty units imposes overvoltage on fault-free units and leads to the disconnection of the series branch from the collector system. By providing auxiliary connection paths, the suggested topology reduces the overvoltage of the units and hence maintains fault-free units operational following a severe failure. Hence, the efficiency of a wind farm increases considerably upon any failure occurrence. To show the merits of the suggested topology, the captured power during a failure has been calculated and fairly compared with that of the conventional SP topology, considering the excess cost of the suggested topology due to additional connection paths. To investigate the performances of both topologies and their feasibility, a collector system including 12 wind turbine generators has been simulated in time domain software environment. Then, various failure scenarios have been investigated to evaluate the transient behavior of the dc collector system following slight and severe failures. The study results reveal the feasibility of the proposed topology as a promising structure for future dc collector systems. Â© 1982-2012 IEEE.

AB  - A new approach, Dynamic Minimal Spanning Tree (DMST) algorithm, which is based on the MST algorithm is proposed in this paper to optimize the cable connection layout for large scale offshore wind farm collection system. The current carrying capacity of the cable is considered as the main constraint. The dynamic changing of the cable capacity, therefore, the cost during the searching process is presented in this work. Two wind farms are chosen as the studied case and the final results show that the proposed method can save the investment on cables 1.07% and 6.10% respectively compared with MST method. It is a more economical way for cable connection configuration design of offshore wind farm collection system. Â© 2015 IEEE.

TI  - Coordinated control strategy for receiving-end AC fault ride-through of an MMC-HVDC connecting offshore wind power [æµ·ä¸Šé£Žç”µç»æŸ”æ€§ç›´æµè”ç½‘ç³»ç»Ÿå—ç«¯äº¤æµæ•…éšœç©¿è¶Šåè°ƒæŽ§åˆ¶ç­–ç•¥]
AB  - To deal with the problem of receiving-end AC fault ride-through of an MMC-HVDC system connecting offshore wind power, coordinated suppression strategies of DC overvoltage are proposed to achieve the receiving-end AC fault ride-through. For a monopolar DC overvoltage, by reasonably switching the control mode of a bipolar MMC, the fault pole MMC can actively maintain DC voltage stability. The precise load-shedding control strategy of a wind farm is designed to ensure the full load operation of a non-fault pole MMC, so as to reduce the impact of monopolar MMC outage on the receiving-end system. For the bipolar DC overvoltage, a wind farm load-shedding control strategy based on local DC voltage measurement information is designed. This can actively reduce the output power of the wind farm according to the DC voltage change rate and deviation, and effectively suppress the rise rate and amplitude of DC voltage. Then additional pitch angle control and its parameter selection principle are proposed to make the wind farm and the capacitors in each converter station jointly maintain the stability of DC voltage, so as to improve the fault ride-through capability of the system. Finally, based on the RTLAB OP5600 real-time digital simulation platform, the system simulation model is built. The simulation results under different receiving-end AC faults show that the proposed coordinated suppression strategies of DC overvoltage can effectively ensure the DC voltage remains in a safe operational range, and maintains the safe and stable operation of the system.

TI  - Wind Farm Operation And Maintenance Optimization Using Big Data
AB  - In the current electricity production mix wind energy is claiming a significant part. In order to guarantee stable electricity production predictability of the wind farm operational behaviour is essential. Big data approaches have the potential for a significant role in realizing this goal. In order to gain insights in turbine operational behaviour it is necessary to obtain a farm wide dataset, containing the operational sensor data of the different machines and context information such as maintenance data. Advanced analytics can use this data for understanding normal and deviating turbine operational behaviour. These insights will help in optimizing the operation and maintenance strategy of the farm. This paper gives an overview of our big data approach for data-storage and illustrates some of our data-analytics research tracks for gaining insights in the underlying failure mechanisms of turbines.

TI  - Coordinated Start-Up Control and Inter-Converter Oscillations Damping for MMC-HVDC Grid
AB  - Modular multilevel converter (MMC)-based high-voltage direct current (HVDC) grid is a promising technology for multiple offshore wind farms (OWFs) to form interconnected offshore grids. However, in the MMC-HVdc grid, the converter terminals connecting the OWFs could only be passively pre-charged by the ones connecting active ac networks via the dc lines during the start-up process. Under this condition, the start-up process of HVdc grid of the passive-side converters becomes significantly complicated. This paper, considering an HVdc grid integrating multiple passive-side converters, investigates its start-up process with three main contributions: 1) a modified nearest level modulation (NLM) method is proposed for the passive-side converters to mitigate the inrush currents after they are deblocked; 2) based on the dc-side equivalent models, the inter-converter resonances and oscillations between the passive-side converters are analyzed after they are deblocked, and; 3) an oscillation damping controller is proposed to provide the electrical damping of inter-converter oscillations between the passive-side converters. The simulation results in PSCAD/EMTDC from a four-terminal MMC-HVDC grid with two terminals connecting the OWFs verify the effectiveness of the proposed start-up control schemes.

TI  - The Crucial Records Number to Retrieve Offshore Directional Wind Distribution
AB  - The wind energy production estimates are very important to a wind power project. And, the remote sensing technique has been widely used to obtain the offshore wind speed and direction which could be used to calculate the wind energy of potential wind farm. However, the directional wind energy distributions are rarely studied, which also play important roles in analysis of wind farms' potential power. In this article, the minimum number of records to obtain offshore directional wind distribution is stated by simulation experiment on In-situ dataset. The NDBC buoy dataset is randomly and multiply sampled to build new dataset under different numbers of observation records, which vary from 21 to 800. The resample under the same number of observation is repeated for 100 times to build dataset group. The directional wind distribution of new dataset is compared with the one of original buoy dataset, and errors made by dataset with fewer records are calculated. Besides, the 10th largest error in the sampled dataset group, which have the same number of observation records, is regarded as the error bound for those dataset. The change rule of the error bound is shown by fitted curves. Based on the fitted curves, minimum number of records is calculated. By this simulation experiment, the minimum number of records to represent wind direction frequency is 350, and 800 for annual direction distributions of wind energy density. To reduce the number of records needed in retrieval, some methods are discussed and tested. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Flicker evaluation of the seaGen tidal power plant
AB  - This paper presents the power quality evaluation of a 1.2-MW tidal power plant. The results show that the unit works well and that the power quality impact is moderae to low and for future units which most likely will have more turbines, the power quality impact will be very low. The wind turbine power quality standard IEC 61400-21 was used in this investigation, and was adequate; however, regarding the connecting transients, there could be a need for a specific standard. It is found that the power level is well controlled at higher water speeds; the maximum 10-min power is found to be 1.21 MW. The maximum 2-s value is found to be 1.46 MW and the maximum 60-s value is found to be 1.30 MW. The reactive power exchange with the grid is negligible; at full load, the power factor is 0.99. The flicker coefficient is between 1 and 5, depending on the grid impedance angle. Finally, it can be said that the maximum total harmonic distortion (THD) for the voltages is found to be 1.2% and for the current 0.65% during operation with the complete power plant. Â© 2011 IEEE.

TI  - Characterization of offshore vertical wind shear conditions in Southern New England
AB  - Vertical wind shears could have a significant effect on the energy produced by a wind turbine and on its loads. Although the development of several wind farms has been planned on the East Coast of the United States, there are no studies that characterize the vertical wind shear over this area. This study focuses on characterizing wind shears in the marine boundary layer in Southern New England and along the East Coast of the United States. The analysis looks at the statistical distribution of vertical wind shear values and at their associated meteorological conditions. The analysis relies on remote-sensing wind measurements and other meteorological data recorded at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Airâ€“Sea Interaction Tower located 3 km to the South of Martha's Vineyard, together with buoy measurements and ERA5 reanalysis data. This work shows that large vertical wind shear values (>0.05 m/s/m) calculated using wind measurements at 60 and 53 m were often observed (â‰ˆ25.3% of all the valid wind profiles analyzed) for South-Westerly winds within a range of positive bulk Richardson numbers 0â€“0.1. These large-shear values are the result of the presence of a strong high-pressure system (Bermuda-Azores High) over the North Atlantic basin and low pressures over land, which result in warm Southerly winds flowing over the cold waters of the Labrador current. The power density computed considering the vertical wind shear by means of the rotor equivalent wind speed is 5.5% smaller than that considering wind speed measurements at 110 m only.

TI  - Wave interaction and energy absorption from arrays of complex-shaped point absorbers
AB  - Water wave interactions with arrays of wave energy converters are numerically investigated based on the interaction theory. The converter is a heaving point absorber that can harness the ocean wave energy through up-and-down movements. A semi-analytical hybrid method is developed that combines the boundary element method and the interaction theory. The developed numerical method is verified against theoretical solutions for arrays of truncated vertical circular cylinders. Three different array layouts are studied in detail. It is found that trapped waves exist at critical wave numbers just below the cutoff values, and the peak load on the middle device increases with the number of devices in head waves. With the increase in the complexity of the array layout, significant wave force enhancement is observed, leading to a broader range of magnitude and stronger variations over the frequency band in beam waves. Moreover, variations of the q-factor show that there are some remarkable "bright spot"regions, indicating that the wave energy absorption there is locally optimized against wave conditions. By arranging the layout in a more randomized way, the optimal conditions for maximized power output can be hard to achieve, but the maximum power output can increase to a higher level.

TI  - Design and simulation of a novel mechanical power take-off for a two-body wave energy point absorber
AB  - In this paper, a two-body self-react wave energy converter with a novel mechanical Power Take-off (PTO) is introduced. The PTO rectifies the mechanical motion and regulates the flow with a mechanism called Mechanical Motion Rectifier (MMR), which converts the reciprocating motion of the ocean wave into unidirectional rotation of the generator. The overall system is analyzed in both time and frequency domain. In time domain, the piecewise non-linear dynamic model of the MMR PTO is derived, and parameters that could significantly influence the MMR property is extracted. By building the model into WEC-Sim, a time domain wave energy converter (WEC) simulation tool, to simulate and evaluate the performance of the PTO. In addition, the system is modelled as a two-body vibration system for frequency domain analysis in order to further investigate and optimize the proposed wave energy converter. The tunable parameters within the system, including the equivalent mass, the equivalent damping coefficient, and the PTO stiffness, are discussed based on the criteria of maximization of the total output power. To verify the theoretical analysis, a bench test prototype is developed and tested on a hydraulic test machine. The experimental results in line with the derived model and can be used for reasonable estimation on the output power of the proposed system in real ocean conditions. Â© Copyright 2018 ASME.

TI  - Surface roughness for offshore wind energy
AB  - The Northeastern coast of the U.S. is expected to increase its offshore wind capacity from 30 MW today to 86 GW by 2050. Measurements of wind speeds are available near sea level, but not at hub height, thus extrapolation is often required using the surface roughness, z(0). The focus of this study is to estimate the surface roughness length off the Northeastern coast of the U.S. using field measurements from Nantucket Sound, MA, with three methods: 1) analytical, dependent on friction velocity and atmospheric stability, 2) the Charnock relationship between z(0) and friction velocity, and 3) a statistical method, based on wind speed observations at three heights. The main results of this paper are: a comparison of the three methods, a comprehensive error analysis of each method, a regional z(0) value of 10(-3) m, and a new mathematical interpretation of surface roughness.

TI  - A modelling approach for evaluating the wind resource and power generation using a high-resolution grid at selected regions in the northeast of Thailand
AB  - Wind power plays a role in easing the climate crisis. The electricity generation from wind can reduce the use of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. Among the renewable energy sources, wind energy has been identified as one of the main potential sources for Thailand, and the geographical position of the upper northeast region is advantageous for wind energy generation. However, the optimal sites for installing wind power plants are specific, since wind potential is dependent on many factors. This research proposes approaches to specify the potential areas for wind power projects via simulated wind flow models. To achieve these assessments, the MC2 and Ms-Micro models were applied for mesoscale and microscale atmospheric models combined with a 10 year period of the climate database from NCEP/FNL. The evaluation of energy production, wind turbine selection and the cost of energy at each site have been investigated in this research. Based on the wind resource simulation results, the high potential areas are chiefly located in mountainous areas. It was concluded that the Kalasin site produced the largest energy output for wind power. Consequently, the information from this research can justify the feasibility of wind power plants in Thailand and the model developed can be applied to predict the potential of wind energy in other regions of the world.

TI  - Marine Renewable Energy Seascape
AB  - ABSTRACT Energy production based on fossil fuel reserves is largely responsible for carbon emissions, and hence global warming. The planet needs concerted action to reduce fossil fuel usage and to implement carbon mitigation measures. Ocean energy has huge potential, but there are major interdisciplinary problems to be overcome regarding technology, cost reduction, investment, environmental impact, governance, and so forth. This article briefly reviews ocean energy production from offshore wind, tidal stream, ocean current, tidal range, wave, thermal, salinity gradients, and biomass sources. Future areas of research and development are outlined that could make exploitation of the marine renewable energy (MRE) seascape a viable proposition; these areas include energy storage, advanced materials, robotics, and informatics. The article concludes with a sustainability perspective on the MRE seascape encompassing ethics, legislation, the regulatory environment, governance and consenting, economic, social, and environmental constraints. A new generation of engineers is needed with the ingenuity and spirit of adventure to meet the global challenge posed by MRE. Â© 2016 THE AUTHORS

TI  - Performance assessment of pitch-type wave energy converter in irregular wave conditions on the basis of numerical investigation
AB  - In this paper, a pitch-type wave energy converter (WEC-rotor) is investigated in irregular wave conditions for the real sea testing at the west coast of Jeju Island, South Korea. The present research builds on and extends our previous work on regular waves to irregular waves. The hydrodynamic characteristics of the WEC-rotor are assessed by establishing a quasi-two-dimensional numerical wave tank using computational fluid dynamics by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equation. The numerical solution is validated with physical experiments, and the comparison shows good agreement. Furthermore, the hydrodynamic performance of the WEC-rotor is explored by investigating the effect of the power take-off (PTO) loading torque by one-way and two-way systems, the wave height, the wave period, operational and high sea wave conditions. Irrespective of the sea wave conditions, the absorbed power is quadratic in nature with the one-way and two-way PTO loading systems. The power absorption increases with the wave height, and the increment is rapid and mild in the two-way and one-way PTO loading torques, respectively. The pitch response amplitude operator increases as the wave period increases until the maximum value and then decreases. For a fixed PTO loading, the power and efficiency are higher in the two-way PTO loading system than in the one-way PTO loading system at different wave periods.

TI  - Public acceptance of offshore wind energy: Relationships among general and specific attitudes
AB  - As interest in implementing offshore wind energy has grown in the United States, so has the desire of social scientists to better understand public responses to the technology. One theme in the literature has been the roles of general attitudes towards renewable energy and perceptions of specific projects in shaping public acceptance of offshore wind farms. A survey of 196 residents of two Rhode Island communities that would be most affected by a proposed wind farm off the coast of Block Island reveals that support for the project is shaped by both general attitudes and project-specific beliefs. General attitudes also have substantial influence on project-specific beliefs. Planning processes should engage the public in discussions of both specific project characteristics and larger issues regarding renewable energy. Â© 2015 MTS.

TI  - Use of Marine Renewable Energy in Ports of Middle East: A Step Toward Sustainable Ports
AB  - Renewable energies are those derived from the natural resources. Their availability and ability to replenish cause less damage to the environment and generate low CO2 emission made them evolve as one of the important sources of energy all over the world. Their benefits also include the savings in economy and their being environment friendly. Ports are important part of a nation's economy. They still serve as unavoidable link in trade worldwide (PIANC Report on Renewable and energy efficiency for Ports 2019.). Hence, the principals of sustainability must be implemented in the ports sector too. To achieve sustainability, we must integrate the renewable energy to the port's energy usage. Various renewable energies include wind, solar, waves, tides, ocean thermal energy conversion, and salinity gradient. Waves, tides, OTEC, salinity gradient fall under marine renewable energy. The proximity of ports to the sea and the large open area makes them more suitable for utilizing renewable energies. Feasibility study, energy usage study, research on overcoming the obstructions, development of site-specific devices, etc., will surely make renewable energy more reachable to the port community and thus the goals of greener ports can be easily achieved.
