TI  - Marine transportation of CO2
AB  - This chapter summarizes a study investigating CO2 marine transportation, which consists of CO2 liquefaction, intermediate storage and loading facilities, and CO2 ships and receiving facilities. Case studies are carried out assuming that the amount of captured CO2 is 20,000 tons/day and the transport distance is widely changed from 200km to 12,000km. The cost of CO2 marine transportation and the additional emissions of CO2 from the system are assessed. Influences of parameters such as ship size, ship speed and CO2 condition before liquefaction are investigated. In the case where CO2 is captured in a chemical absorption process, the gaseous CO2 at the entrance of the liquefaction process is saturated with moisture. Dehydration is, therefore, necessary at first to avoid freezing and/or hydrate generation. For the large scale storage of pressurized liquefied gas, a spherical tank with skirt support is suitable. The design condition of the tank would be near the triple point of CO2. Loading facilities from the storage tank on land to the ship would be the loading arm type and pumps would be located at the port. Unloading depends on the receiving facilities in the CO2 storage system; however the pumps in the cargo tanks of the ship would be used. Â© 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Experimental salt cavern in offshore ultra-deep water and well design evaluation for CO2 abatement
AB  - This paper presents a proposal for an experimental salt cavern in offshore ultra-deep water for CO2 abatement, including the instrumentation plan and well conceptual design evaluated for carbon capture and storage (CCS) application. These studies are based on applied computational mechanics associated with field experimentation that has contributed to the technical feasibility of the underground potash mine at the State of Sergipe in Brazil. This knowhow allowed the stability analysis of several salt caverns for brine production at the State of Alagoas in Brazil and to the drilling through stratified thick layers of salt of the pre-salt reservoirs in Santos Basin. Now, this knowledge has been applied in the design of onshore and offshore salt caverns opened by dissolution for storage of natural gas and CO2. The geomechanical study, through the application of computational mechanics, of offshore giant salt caverns of 450 m high by 150 m in diameter, shows that one cavern can store about 4 billion Sm-3 or 7.2 million tons of CO2. Before the construction of the giant cavern, which will be the first gas storage offshore in the world, it has been decided to develop an experimental one, with smaller size, to obtained field parameters. The experimental cavern will allow the calibration of parameters to be used in the structural integrity analysis of the cavern and well for storage of natural gas which is rich in CO2 under high pressure.

TI  - Application of fuel cells with zero-carbon fuels in short-sea shipping
AB  - This paper investigates the viability of different fuel cell types in a ship power system, where hydrogen and ammonia are considered as zero-carbon fuels. The identification of alternatives to diesel-powered ships is performed by taking into account the environmental and economic indicators of the considered power systems, determined by Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life-Cycle Cost Assessment (LCCA), and further compared with the existing diesel power systems of three passenger ships operating in Croatian coastal waters. Special attention is paid to fuel origin, where fossil fuels (grey fuel), fossil fuels followed by CO2 capture (blue fuel), and those produced from renewable energy sources (green fuel) are considered. The results of the research indicate that fuel cell systems with grey hydrogen and grey ammonia are not environmentally friendly, while fuel cell systems with the blue and green types of these fuels have a lower impact on the environment than a diesel-powered ship, with a reduction of up to 84% in CO2-eq emissions when green ammonia is used. Regarding profitability, the diesel-powered ship has the lowest total costs, while the second most cost-effective option is the fuel cell system with blue ammonia as fuel with 27%-43% higher costs than a diesel-powered ship, depending on which type of fuel cell is used. Although blue ammonia is a cheaper fuel than diesel fuel, the lifetime costs of the fuel cell power system are affected by relatively high investment costs (fuel cell, battery, cracker, etc.) and equipment replacement costs.

TI  - Variations of net ecosystem CO2 exchange in a tidal inundated wetland: Coupling MODIS and tower-based fluxes
AB  - Tidal activity is a major factor determining the distribution of plant species and ecosystem functions, including carbon fluxes. To explore the spatial variations of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and related regulatory mechanisms along the tidal inundation gradient (i.e., middle or low tidal flat), an NEE estimation model using piecewise regression analysis was developed by coupling the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)- and tower-based measurements. The results showed that our model achieved an adequate NEE estimation (slope = 0.70, R-2 = 0.78). Then the model was applied to estimate NEE variation along a transect with a tidal inundation gradient. The average NEE was -1.75 g C m(-2) d(-1), varying from -2.02 g C m(-2) d(-1) to -1.42 g C m(-2) d(-1) from island-to oceanside. Generally, our empirical model captured the spatiotemporal patterns of NEE and the variation of the regulatory factors along the gradient. The sensitivity analysis of various regulatory variables showed that the variations of NEE near the islandside were primarily caused by seasonal shift and annual cycle of vegetation, whereas at the oceanside, NEE was more influenced by tidal activity with no clear phenological influence. In the middle area, NEE seemed to be subjected to both phenological changes of vegetation and tidal activity. In conclusion, this study illustrates that the estimates derived from MODIS-and tower-based flux data are reliable for quantifying the spatiotemporal variations of NEE and reflecting the effect of tidal activity on NEE.

TI  - Efficient CO2Capture and Activation on Novel Two-Dimensional Transition Metal Borides
AB  - The large-scale production of CO2 in the atmosphere has triggered global warming, the greenhouse effect, and ocean acidification. The CO2 conversion to valuable chemical products or its capture and storage are of fundamental importance to mitigate the greenhouse effect on the environment. Therefore, exploring new two-dimensional (2D) materials is indispensable due to their potential intriguing properties. Here, we report a new family of 2D transition metal borides (M2B2, M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Fe; known as MBenes) and demonstrate their static and dynamic stability. These MBenes show a metallic nature and exhibit excellent electrical conductivity. The CO2 adsorption energy on MBenes ranges from -1.04 to -3.95 eV and exhibits the decreasing order as Sc2B2 > Ti2B2 > V2B2 > Cr2B2 > Mn2B2 > Fe2B2. The spin-polarization calculation shows a reduction in the adsorption energy for magnetic systems. Bader charge transfer indicates the formation of CO2Î´- moiety on the MBene surface, so-called activated CO2, which is essential for its reaction with other surface chemicals. Differential charge density plots reveal a significant charge accumulation around the CO2 molecule. Our theoretical results predict the usage of new MBenes as a cost-effective catalyst for CO2 capture and activation. Â© 2022 American Chemical Society.

TI  - CO2Net: A marine monitoring system for CO2 leakage detection
AB  - Underwater oil and gas extraction and distribution, as well as the investigation of solutions for CO2 storage underwater, demand for new technologies to perform pervasive real life monitoring and control of underwater critical infrastructures. In this paper we present a system, named CO2Net, we have developed to perform accurate real-life monitoring of underwater CO2 storage infrastructures. The basic component of our system is the CO2Probe, a new underwater monitoring node which combines sensing, acoustic communications and networking capabilities. CO2Probes are connected via acoustic links in an underwater sensor network which provides robust, real-life communications of the monitored data both in single-hop and multi-hop deployments. The user has a realtime control on the monitoring system, being able to change alarm threshold values and sampling rates. The proposed CO2Net approach overcomes the major limitations of system currently available on the market, and provides a first easy to use, flexible and easy to extend, complete monitoring system for underwater infrastructures, based on the emerging underwater sensor networking paradigm. A first prototype of CO2Net has been tested during summer-fall 2011 at the NATO Undersea Research Centre (NURC) in La Spezia. Results of these experiments confirm system reliability, and its adaptability: all requested data where provided in real-time, the system was remotely accessible and end user could change monitoring parameters.

TI  - CO2-induced acidification affects hatching success in Calanus finmarchicus
AB  - Bottle incubations were conducted to examine how exposure to seawater containing 8000 ppm carbon dioxide (CO2; pH 6.95) influenced the growth and reproduction of the keystone copepod Calanus finmarchicus. The chosen concentration Of CO2 is expected to occur over 100s of cubic kilometres of seawater as a result of marine CO2 storage/disposal, and is also representative of the predicted `worst-case' atmospheric CO2 scenario in the year 2300. Growth (egg production and biomass loss) in adult female copepods was not affected by the simulated ocean acidification. In contrast, a maximum of only 4\% of the eggs successfully yielded nauplii after 72 h in the experimental treatment. Our results demonstrate that environmental risk assessments for marine CO2 storage/disposal must look beyond adult mortality as an endpoint. Furthermore, if CO2 is to be disposed of in the deep sea, the location and timing of such activities must take into consideration the overwintering populations of C. finmarchicus.

TI  - SiteChar - Workflow for fit-for-purpose characterisation of CO2 storage sites in Europe
AB  - The FP7 SiteChar project has examined the entire site characterization chain, from the initial feasibility studies through to the final stage of application for a storage permit, on the basis of criteria defined by the relevant European legislation, highlighting important issues and recommendations such as the importance of a fit-to purpose process driven by a risk and uncertainty reduction strategy. The research was based on the characterisation at different levels of five sites representative of the context and geology a range of potential CO2 storage complexes in Europe. A key innovation was the development of internal dry-run licence applications for two sites, an offshore hydrocarbon field and an onshore deep saline aquifer formation. These applications helped to refine the storage site characterisation workflow and identify gaps in site-specific characterisation required to secure storage permits under the EC Directive. Economic aspects have also been addressed pointing out the heterogeneity and consequently the highly site-specific structure of the storage costs. Public participation activities were conducted at both an onshore and an offshore site. These ensured local stakeholders views were part of the application process and so successfully incorporate lessons learned from social site characterisation into the permit application.

TI  - An offshore reservoir monitoring system based on fibre-optic distributed sensing of seabed strains
AB  - One of the problems affecting mature hydrocarbon fields, e.g., Ekofisk, Tyra, and Dan in the North Sea, is seabed subsidence due to reservoir depletion. Fluid injection is a widely used method to boost production and/or maintain reservoir pressure in order to mitigate compaction and subsidence. Both reservoir depletion and fluid injection operations might induce seabed deformations. The deformation pattern potentially holds useful information about production efficiency and reservoir management, which could be captured by careful monitoring of seabed strains. Therefore, the idea suggested herein was performing near full-field and continuous monitoring of seabed deformations by means of distributed fibre-optic strain sensing. The objective of the study was to theoretically calculate and assess whether current technologies (i.e., off-the-shelf optical interrogators) are accurate and sensitive enough to detect production-induced seabed strains originating at a 2 km-deep reservoir. The analysis indicates that depletion-induced subsidence is potentially measurable with seabed distributed fibre-optic strain sensing. However, the operation of an injector-producer array induces seabed strains that are too small to be detected with current capabilities. Â© 2020 EAGE Publishing BV. All rights reserved.

TI  - Optimizing Fe-based catalysis in carbon dioxide hydrogenation reactions for future synthesis of liquid hydrocarbons from seawater
AB  - The current global reliance upon petroleum fuel presents unique challenges to develop new, sustainable solutions to address present and future energy demands. This perspective describes the research efforts at the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) to address basic research challenges in the capture and utilization of CO2 from seawater, where contemporaneous work in this field is cited. Recent work to optimize CO2 extraction from seawater is briefly highlighted, featuring progress towards the operational scale-up and demonstration of an integrated process. The bulk of this article focuses on concurrent research to develop catalysts and test their performance in the hydrogenation of CO2, where results in transitioning from a continuous-stirred tank reactor (CSTR) system to a more modular and scalable fixed-bed system are detailed. Efforts to further improve and scale-up fixed-bed systems are also pointed out with respect to stabilizing catalysts against degradation effects of water produced in the hydrogenation of CO2.

TI  - Review of IPCC working group III findings on the impact of energy policy options on GHG emissions
AB  - Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has assessed mitigation options for the past 20 years. This paper reviews its assessments of bioenergy, geothermal, hydropower, ocean energy, solar, wind, nuclear, and carbon capture and storage (CCS), respectively, over that period. The assessments of hydropower, nuclear, and geothermal tend to focus on the social, economic, and environmental considerations that inhibit expansion of these mature technologies. The assessments of bioenergy, solar, and wind reflect their technological progress and market penetration. Assessments of ocean energy and CCS conclude they are likely to make only a modest contribution to mitigation efforts by 2030.

TI  - Inclusive environmental impact assessment for newly-proposed airport in Korea using Triple I(III)
AB  - The needs and importance of the developments and utilizations of ocean not only as the sources of renewable energy and mineral resources but also as/for the counter-measurement for global warming, such as CCS(carbon capture and storage), have become higher and higher, especially to the countries having limited land area and resources. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the sustainability of an ocean utilization technology or systems not only from an economical point of view but also from an ecological one. For this purpose, a comprehensive evaluation method and/or index, by which the assessment and decision on the technology and system can be made more objectively, might be effective, as well as the environmental simulation model, which was developed and reported in the previous research. The aim of this study is to modify a reasonable and quantitative index, with which a comprehensive evaluation system can be established, to assess the environmental sustainability and risk. In this study, ecological footprint (EF), which was developed as an environmental sustainability index, and the Inclusive Impact Index (Triple I, (III)), which has been presently being studied and developed as an integrated environmental risk index, are modified and applied for the construction of new airport in Korea.

TI  - Impact and detectability of hypothetical CCS offshore seep scenarios as an aid to storage assurance and risk assessment
AB  - Carbon Capture and Storage has the potential to make a significant contribution to the mitigation of climate change, however there is a regulatory and societal obligation to demonstrate storage robustness and minimal local environmental impact. This requires an understanding of environmental impact potential and detectability of a range of hypothetical leak scenarios. In the absence of a significant body of real-world release experiments this study collates the results of 86 modelled scenarios of offshore marine releases derived from five different model systems. This synthesis demonstrates a consistent generalised relationship between leak rate, detectability and impact potential of a wide range of hypothetical releases from CO2 storage, which can be described by a power law. For example a leak of the order of 1 T per day should be detectable at, at least, 60 m distance with an environmental impact restricted to less than a 15 m radius of the release point. Small releases are likely to require bottom mounted (lander) monitoring to ensure detection. In summary this work, when coupled with a quantification of leakage risk can deliver a first order environmental impact assessment as an aid to the consenting process. Further this work demonstrates that non-catastrophic release events can be detected at thresholds well below levels which would undermine storage performance or significantly impact the environment, given an appropriate monitoring strategy.

TI  - Investigation of offshore thermal power plant with carbon capture as an alternative to carbon dioxide transport
AB  - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology is considered as one option to reduce CO2 emissions in order to mitigate climate change. The conventional CCS technology has its own complications including high costs and risks for storing CO2. This paper introduces the concept of Offshore Thermal Power Plant with CCS (OTPPC), which eliminates the needs for transporting CO2 and therefore reduces the complications of the whole system. A general design selection process for the OTPPC is established. A case study is carried out to demonstrate the application of OTPPC and the cost-effectiveness of this concept is evaluated by calculating the Levelised Cost Of Energy (LCOE) for both the OTPPC and conventional CCS technology for an onshore power plant with assumption that CCS is necessary.

TI  - Passive acoustic monitoring of seabed gas seeps - Application of beamforming techniques
AB  - Passive acoustics has been identified as an important strategy to determine underwater gas flux at natural sites, or at locations related to anthropogenic activities. The ability of an acoustic system to detect, quantify and locate a gas leak is fundamentally controlled by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the bubble sounds relative to the background noise. To demonstrate the effectiveness of array processing for passive monitoring of gas seeps, this work considers the use of beamforming methods to enhance the SNR and so improve the performance of passive acoustic systems. To achieve high levels of noise reduction an adaptive bubble focused broadband beamformer is employed, specifically the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer. The technique is demonstrated using an array of five hydrophones collecting data at the controlled CO2 gas release experiment conducted as part of STEMM-CCS (Strategies for Environmental Monitoring of Marine Carbon Capture and Storage) project.

TI  - Carbon capture and storage and enhanced oil recovery: A fully integrated approach
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been widely accepted as a key method of reducing anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions from industrial processes and energy generation. Furthermore, experience from Texas and Canada have proven the effectiveness of tertiary or enhanced oil recovery (EOR) utilising CO 2 injection. Recent studies in the United Kingdom have indicated the potential for an addition 6 billion bbl of oil that may be produced by CO 2 injection with on-shore carbon capture projects providing a constant and reliable CO 2 stream, the absence of which has been a key reason why this technology has not been implemented at an earlier stage. In this study, we investigate and appraise the case for a fully integrated approach, utilising pure CO 2 storage in deep saline formations allied to EOR in nearby oil fields, supplied by CO 2 captured from an on-shore coal fired power station. Working in accordance with the EU directive on storage of CO 2, we examined in detail the geology and petrophysics for the deep saline formation utilising 2D seismic and exploration well data, allied to nearby analogues for inferred rock mechanics, conducted a full pressure study to examine the connectivity and pressure regime of the formation, and estimated storage capacity based on differing subsurface scenarios to form the static model.

TI  - Potential of carbon dioxide storage from petroleum industries in the Gulf of Thailand for green production
AB  - Recently, climate change and global warming are the global concern because of an increase in the huge amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. This gas comes from energy activities and industries like petroleum industries. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the practical technology to reduce and storage CO2. In Thailand, one of the main potential sites for storage is the Gulf of Thailand. However, the research on this issue is very rare in Thailand. Consequently, this work is aiming on the potential study of CO2 geological storage in formations in the Gulf of Thailand by using simulation. The CO2 storage capacity, pressure buildup and plume migration have been estimated. Also, this study has been simulated with various conditions. CO2 injection is used from 1,000-4,000 tons per day with the depth from 2,200-2,330 meters and the results are studied for 50 years as a monitoring period. The results present that with the formation characteristics, CO2 storage in this area has potential. Moreover, pressure buildup and plume migration are illustrated for the period of 50 years. As a fundamental knowledge, this study can contribute to CO2 storage in an offshore area in Thailand. Â© 2018 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Total cost of carbon capture and storage implemented at a regional scale: Northeastern and midwestern United States: Total Cost of Carbon Capture and Storage
AB  - We model the costs of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in subsurface geological formations for emissions from 138 northeastern and midwestern electricity-generating power plants. The analysis suggests coal-sourced CO 2 emissions can be stored in this region at a cost of $52-$60 ton-1, whereas the cost to store emission from natural-gas-fired plants ranges from approximately $80 to $90. Storing emissions offshore increases the lowest total costs of CCS to over $60 per ton of CO 2 for coal. Because there apparently is sufficient onshore storage in the northeastern and midwestern United States, offshore storage is not necessary or economical unless there are additional costs or suitability issues associated with the onshore reservoirs. For example, if formation pressures are prohibitive in a large-scale deployment of onshore CCS, or if there is opposition to onshore storage, offshore storage space could probably store emissions at an additional cost of less than $10 ton-1. Finally, it is likely that more than 8 Gt of total CO 2 emissions from this region can be stored for less $60 ton-1, slightly more than the $50 ton-1 Section 45Q tax credits incentivizing CCS.

TI  - Experience In Onshore and Offshore CCS Development
AB  - Over the past fifteen years Shell have explored for, and developed, onshore storage at Quest in Alberta, Canada, and progressed offshore storage in a depleted field to final investment level. We are now developing new projects both onshore and offshore, in aquifers and depleted fields. This paper describes the projects and the integrated value chains - and highlight the differences between developing hydrocarbon resources where the subsurface is the upstream and the prime driver of value, and CO2 storage resources where the subsurface is effectively the downstream, and value is derived from the CO2 sources which are now the "upstream". The experience in developing regulations and projects in partnership with regulators is then outlined and linked to the subsurface technical work. We describe how the technical work builds upon and extends normal hydrocarbon workflows. Key aspects of exploring for saline formation/aquifer storage and depleted field storage are discussed and some of the key challenges of managing the CO2 phase envelope in depleted fields are described. The balance of uncertainty between aquifer storage and depleted field storage is explained, with particular emphasis on the often-neglected challenge of inaccessible wellbores. We have successfully developed onshore storage that, by the time of the conference, will have injected over 7Mt of CO2 sourced from decarbonisation of hydrogen manufacture. In the UK we developed and submitted storage permit applications, and full FEED studies were executed, for depleted field storage. However, this project was halted when Government priorities changed. This has formed the groundwork for multiple new operated projects in North America and Europe. The startup and injection experience from onshore storage in Quest in Alberta, Canada will be presented. Developing CCS projects relies on many of our petroleum engineering and geoscience domains of expertise and can, at first glance, look similar, but there are key differences, for example in containment, capacity, phase behaviour, sustained injectivity, and permitting. These novel aspects must not be neglected and require new analytical approaches. Many new entrants appear to be underestimating these challenges. Copyright Â© 2022, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - Experimental Study of O-2-Enriched CO2 Production by BaCo0.8B0.2O3-delta (B=Ce, Al, Fe, Cu) Perovskites Sorbent for Marine Exhaust CO2 Capture Application
AB  - An effective approach for reducing CO2 emissions from marine exhaust is adopting oxyfuel combustion technology. A series of B-site doped BaCo0.8B0.2O3-delta (B=Ce, Al, Fe, Cu) perovskites as novel oxygen carrier applications were prepared by the sol-gel method. The oxygen desorption characteristics of the B-site doped BaCo0.8B0.2O3-delta perovskites and the effects of adsorption/desorption temperature, CO2 volume flow rate, CO2 partial pressures, and adsorption time were researched in the fixed bed reactor. The surface morphology and size of the oxygen carrier was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results showed that BaCo0.8Al0.2O3-delta and BaCo0.8Ce0.2O3-delta have comparable performance, considering the cost of the raw materials. BaCo0.8Al0.2O3-delta was selected as candidate for further study(.) The optimal adsorption/desorption temperature, CO2 volume flow rate, CO2 partial pressure and adsorption time for BaCo0.8Al0.2O3-delta were studied in detail. Results showed that the best operating parameters were determined to be 850 degrees C/850 degrees C for adsorption/desorption temperature, 200 mL/min for CO2 volume flow rate, 100\% CO2 partial pressure, and 30 min for absorption time, respectively. Furthermore, multiple cycle results indicate that BaCo0.8Al0.2O3-delta sorbent has high reactivity and cyclic stability.

TI  - Adapting gas turbines to zero emission oxy-fuel power plants
AB  - Future power plants will require some type of carbon capture and storage (CCS) system to mitigate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The most promising technologies for CCS are: oxy-fuel (O-F) combustion, pre-combustion capture, and post-combustion capture. This paper discusses the recent work conducted by Siemens Power Generation, Florida Turbine Technologies, Inc. (FTT) and Clean Energy Systems, Inc. (CES) in adapting high temperature gas turbines to use CES's drive gases in high-efficiency O-F zero emission power plants (ZEPPs). CES's O-F cycle features high-pressure combustion of fuel with oxygen (O2) in the presence of recycled coolant (water, steam or CO 2) to produce drive gases composed predominantly of steam and CO 2. This cycle provides the unique capability to capture nearly pure CO2 and trace by-products by simple condensation of the steam.An attractive O-F power cycle uses high, intermediate and low pressure turbines (HPT, IPT and LPT, respectively). The HPT may be based on either current commercial or advanced steam turbine technology. Low pressure steam turbine technology is readily applicable to the LPT. To achieve high efficiencies, an IPT is necessary and efficiency increases with inlet temperature. The high-temperature IPT's necessitate advanced turbine materials and cooling technology. O-F plants have an abundance of water, cool steam Ìƒ200Â°C (400Â°F) and CO2 that can be used as cooling fluids within the combustor and IPT systems. For the "First Generation" ZEPP, a General Electric J79 turbine, minus the compressor, to be driven directly by CES's 170 MW, high-pressure oxy-fuel combustor (gas generator), has been adapted. A modest inlet gas temperature of 760Â°C (MOOT) was selected to eliminate the need for turbine cooling. The J79 turbine operating on natural gas delivers 32 MWe and incorporates a single-stage free-turbine that generates an additional 11 MWe. When an HPT and an LPT are added, the net output power (accounting for losses) becomes 60 MWe at 30% efficiency based on lower heating value (LHV), including the parasitic loads for O2 separation and compression and for CO2 capture and compression to 151.5 bar (2200 psia). For an inlet temperature of 927Â°C (1700Â°F), the nominal value, the net output power is 70 MWe at 34% efficiency (LHV). FTT and CES are evaluating a "Second Generation" IPT with a gas inlet temperature of 1260Â°C (2300Â°F). Predicted performance values for these plants incorporating the HPT, IPT and the LPT are: output power of approximately 100-200 MWe with an efficiency of 40 to 45%. The "Third Generation" IPT for 2015+ power plants will be based on the development of very high temperature turbines having an inlet temperature goal of 1760Â°C (3200Â°F). Recent DOE/CES studies project such plants will have LHV efficiencies in the 50% range for natural gas and HHV efficiencies near 40% for gasified coal[1].

TI  - A Review of National Monitoring Requirements to Support Offshore Carbon Capture and Storage
AB  - There is an urgent need to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. One method of achieving this is through Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Geological structures that lie offshore under continental shelf seas offer huge CCS storage potential. An emerging marine industry is developing to exploit this potential and national marine monitoring agencies will soon need to consider the potential impacts of this emerging industry. This review of published literature is aimed at generalists responsible for the delivery of national marine monitoring, as well as those involved in the management of the marine environment. It briefly summarizes why the emerging offshore CCS industry is needed, how large it may be and what marine infrastructure may be involved. For the purposes of this paper, a hypothetical 20 Mtpa industry has been used to gauge the potential impact of a developing offshore CCS industry. The probability of CO2 leaks from such an industry is low. If they do occur, the spatial scale of impact will be small, and the potential environmental impacts will be low. Irrespective of how CO2 is transported or stored within shelf seas, leaked CO2 will enter the sea as a gas or as a solution dissolved in sediment pore water. CO2 as a gas will dissolve into seawater and/or directly vent to the atmosphere, depending on the initial conditions of the leak. The most probable source of leaks in a developed CCS industry is from pipelines (currently a 2-year event per 1000 km pipeline). The most probable source of leakage from geological storage is through abandoned wells (a 20- to 80-year event for a 20 Mtpa industry). The source of leaks from a CCS scheme with the potential to release the greatest mass of CO2 is through geological faults, as these may go undetected (if they occur) for long periods. The probability of leaks from geological storage, through faults or abandoned wells, is site dependent and minimized by the site selection process. The review concludes with recommended priorities for future marine science development.

TI  - Environmental risks and performance assessment of carbon dioxide (CO2) leakage in marine ecosystems
AB  - This chapter describes the state of the current understanding of the potential for CO2 leaked from carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (CCS) to impact the marine ecosystem. This is a complex problem as it requires an understanding of physical dispersion, the behaviour of plumes, marine chemistry, organism physiology and ecological relationships. Aside from predicting the likelihood of a leak event, the key issue is to understand the spread, persistence and impact of a hypothetical CCS derived leak and contrast this with, for example, trawling impacts and the global long-term consequences of climate change and the uptake of anthropogenically created atmospheric CO2 (ocean acidification), which CCS seeks to mitigate. Excess CO2 in the marine system is undoubtedly harmful to many organisms. In the vicinity of a leak event, it is likely that significant ecological alteration would occur. Initial research indicates that only persistent leaks of a significant proportion of reservoir capacities would cause widespread and unacceptable impacts. However, much more research is required to determine critical leak magnitudes, within sediment interactions and ecosystem recovery before any comprehensive risk assessment of CCS can be delivered.

TI  - Carbon dioxide capture coupled with magnesium utilization from seawater by bipolar membrane electrodialysis
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture coupled with further mineralization in high value-added form is a great challenge for carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) processes. In this work, a bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BMED) technique integrated with crystallization chamber was proposed to utilize CO2-derived carbonates and the residual magnesium resource from seawater to produce functional nesquehonite. To ensure the stable CO2 storage and magnesium extraction by BMED process, the metastable zone during nesquehonite crystallizing was first measured to modulate crystallization rate, obtain high-quality crystal products and inhibit membrane fouling states. Subsequently, the effects of current density, temperature, and CO2 flow rate during the whole BMED-crystallization process were further investigated. The increase in current density and temperature was conducive for the extraction of magnesium while the enlarged gas flow rate induced higher absorption of CO2. Under the current density at 22 A/m2, CO2 flow rate at 50 mL/min and temperature at 30 Â°C, the optimal carbon absorption ratio and the magnesium extraction ratio reached 50.85% and 56.71%, respectively. Under this condition, the explosion nucleation of the nesquehonite was effectively avoided to inhibit membrane fouling and the generation of magnesium hydroxide was depressed to obtain the target product nesquehonite. This study on simultaneous carbon capture and magnesium utilization provides theoretical guidance for the industrial green storage of CO2 and development of valuable magnesium products.

TI  - Planetary Boundaries Assessment of Flue Gas Valorization into Ammonia and Methane
AB  - Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) has attracted growing interest to potentially curb CO2 emissions while generating valuable chemicals. These emerging technologies will coexist with their fossil analogs soon, creating opportunities to combine both. In this context, flue gas valorization from power plants can play a role in this transition. The success of CCU technologies will ultimately depend on its environmental sustainability, which should be evaluated based on global indicators such as the Planetary Boundaries (PBs). Here we assessed the absolute sustainability level of an integrated facility producing ammonia (NH3) and synthetic natural gas (SNG) using hydrogen (H2) from water electrolysis, and nitrogen (N2) and CO2 from flue gas from a combined-cycle natural gas power plant. The LCA-PBs assessment showed that the alternative technologies could contribute to operating the Planet safely by significantly reducing the impact on the climate change and ocean acidification Earth-system processes, compared to the fossil Haber-Bosch (HB) and conventional steam reforming processes. Overall, the investigated process could smoothen the transition towards low-carbon technologies. More broadly, the application of the PBs to quantify the environmental performance of the integrated system opens up new avenues for the absolute sustainability assessment of emerging low-carbon technologies within the chemical sector and beyond.

TI  - Can Thermally Sprayed Aluminum (TSA) Mitigate Corrosion of Carbon Steel in Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Environments?
AB  - Transport of CO2 for carbon capture and storage (CCS) uses low-cost carbon steel pipelines owing to their negligible corrosion rates in dry CO2. However, in the presence of liquid water, CO2 forms corrosive carbonic acid. In order to mitigate wet CO2 corrosion, use of expensive corrosion-resistant alloys is recommended; however, the increased cost makes such selection economically unfeasible; hence, new corrosion mitigation methods are sought. One such method is the use of thermally sprayed aluminum (TSA), which has been used to mitigate corrosion of carbon steel in seawater, but there are concerns regarding its suitability in CO2-containing solutions. A 30-day test was carried out during which carbon steel specimens arc-sprayed with aluminum were immersed in deionized water at ambient temperature bubbled with 0.1Â MPa CO2. The acidity (pH) and potential were continuously monitored, and the amount of dissolved Al3+ ions was measured after completion of the test. Some dissolution of TSA occurred in the test solution leading to nominal loss in coating thickness. Potential measurements revealed that polarity reversal occurs during the initial stages of exposure which could lead to preferential dissolution of carbon steel in the case of coating damage. Thus, one needs to be careful while using TSA in CCS environments. Â© 2016, ASM International.

TI  - A tool for first order estimates and optimisation of dynamic storage resource capacity in saline aquifers
AB  - The importance of carbon capture and storage in mitigating climate change has emerged from the results of techno-economic or integrated assessment modeling, in which scenarios of future energy systems are developed subject to constraints from economic growth and climate change targets. These models rarely include limits imposed by injectivity, ultimate amounts, or the geographic distribution of storage resources. However, they could if a sufficiently simple model were available. We develop a methodology for the fast assessment of the dynamic storage resource of a reservoir under different scenarios of well numbers and interwell distance. The approach combines the use of a single-well multiphase analytical solution and the superposition of pressure responses to evaluate the pressure buildup in a multiwell scenario. The injectivity is directly estimated by means of a nonlinear relationship between flow-rate and overpressure and by imposing a limiting overpressure, which is evaluated on the basis of the mechanical parameters for failure. The methodology is implemented within a tool, named CO2BLOCK, which can optimise site design for the numbers of wells and spacing between wells. Given its small computational expense, the methodology can be applied to a large number of sites within a region. We apply this to analyse the storage potential in the offshore of the UK. We estimate that 25-250 GtCO(2) can be safely stored over an injection time interval of 30 years. We also demonstrate the use of the tool in evaluating tradeoffs between infrastructure costs and maximising injectivity at two specific sites in the offshore UK.

TI  - Supply-side options to reduce land requirements of fully renewable electricity in Europe
AB  - Renewable electricity can fully decarbonise the European electricity supply, but large land requirements may cause land-use conflicts. Using a dynamic model that captures renewable fluctuations, I explore the relationship between land requirements and total system cost of different supply-side options in the future. Cost-minimal fully renewable electricity requires some 97,000 km2 (2% of total) land for solar and wind power installations, roughly the size of Portugal, and includes large shares of onshore wind. Replacing onshore wind with offshore wind, utility-scale PV, or rooftop PV reduces land requirements drastically with only small cost penalties. Moving wind power offshore is most cost-effective and reduces land requirements by 50% for a cost penalty of only 5%. Wind power can alternatively be replaced by photovoltaics, leading to a cost penalty of 10% for the same effect. My research shows that fully renewable electricity supply can be designed with very different physical appearances and impacts on landscapes and the population, but at similar cost.

TI  - A streamlined workflow from experimental analyses to dynamic geochemical modelling
AB  - Dynamic-geochemical model is a powerful instrument to evaluate the geochemical effects on CO2 storage capacity, injectivity and long-term containment. The study objective is to apply an integrated multi-step workflow to a carbon capture and storage (CCS) candidate field (offshore), namely hereinafter H field. From experimental analyses, a comprehensive real data-tailored reactive transport model (RTM) has been built to capture the dynamics and the geochemical phenomena (e.g., water vaporization, CO2 solubility, mineral alteration) occurring during and after the CO2 injection in sedimentary formations. The proposed integrated workflow couples lab activities and numerical simulations and it is developed according to the following steps: 1. Mineralogical-chemical characterization (XRD, XRF and SEM-EDX experimental techniques) of field core samples; 2. Data elaboration and integration to define the conceptual geochemical model; 3. Synthetic brine reconstruction by means of 0D geochemical models; 4. Numerical geochemical modelling at different complexity levels. Field rocks chosen for CO2 injection have been experimentally characterized, showing a high content of Fe in clayey, micaceous and carbonate mineralogical phases. New-defined, site-specific minerals have been characterized, starting from real XRD, XRF and SEM-EDX data and by calculation of their thermochemical parameters with a proprietary procedure. They are used to reconstruct synthetic formation water chemical composition (at equilibrium with both rock mineralogy and gas phase), subsequently used in RTM. CO2 injection is simulated using 2D radial reactive transport model(s) built in a commercial compositional reservoir simulator. The simulations follow a step-increase in the complexity of the model by adding CO2 solubility, water vaporization and geochemical reactions. Geochemical processes impact on CO2 storage capacity and injectivity is quantitatively analyzed. The results show that neglecting the CO2 solubility in formation water may underestimate the max CO2 storage capacity in H field by around 1%, maintaining the same pressure build-up profile. Sensitivities on the impact of formation water salinity on the CO2 solubility are presented. In a one thousand years' timescale, changes in reservoir porosity due to mineral alteration, triggered by CO2-brine-rock interactions, seem to be minimal in the near wellbore and far field. However, it has been seen that water vaporization with the associated halite precipitation inclusion in the simulation models is recommended, especially at high-level of formation brine salinity, for a reliable evaluation of CO2 injectivity related risks. The proposed workflow provides a new perspective in geochemical application for CCS studies, which relies on novel labs techniques (analyses automation), data digitalization, unification and integration with a direct connection to the numerical models. The presented procedure can be followed to assess the geochemical short-and long-term risks in carbon storage projects. Copyright Â© 2021 Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - Connecting Direct Effects of CO2 Radiative Forcing to Ocean Heat Uptake and Circulation
AB  - The ocean's response to direct atmospheric effects of increased carbon dioxide's (CO2) radiative forcing is examined. These direct effects are defined as the climate changes that result from forcing on a fast time scale of about a year, independent of the slower surface warming that the forcing also provokes. To evaluate how these direct effects impact ocean heat uptake and circulation, output of atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) simulations are used to force an ocean GCM with comprehensive boundary conditions. Perturbation simulations with the prescribed response to a quadrupling of atmospheric CO2 include altered surface winds, freshwater fluxes, downwelling shortwave radiation, and downwelling longwave cloud radiative effect. The perturbation simulations show that the intensification and poleward shift of surface winds, particularly in the Southern Ocean, strengthen the shallow overturning circulation in the tropical Pacific and deep overturning in the Atlantic. This, in turn, has a cooling effect on the global ocean at shallow depths. A two-layer energy balance model, designed to capture transient global mean climate change, is adapted to account for the altered ocean heat uptake from direct effects. The direct change in global mean ocean heat uptake is a decrease of about 0.3Â W/m2 for quadrupling of CO2, offsetting about 5% of the surface longwave forcing. Â© 2019. The Authors.

TI  - 2News research & development: Separations: Starbons offer new method of carbon capture
AB  - A team of scientists from the University of York, UK, have developed a new method of carbon capture using solid biomass waste that is more efficient and selective than current treatment methods. The team used a porous material called Starbon, made from food peelings and sea? weed. Starbons do not require high temperatures to function, are four times more selective in capturing CO2 compared to other methods, and are effective in the presence of water. The material is inexpensive to make, and the team can currently produce around 1 kg/day, though plan to scale this to 20 kg/day over the next 3 yr.

TI  - Triality, a VLCC for the future
AB  - The concept vessel Triality was developed by DNV during the fall 2010, to demonstrate how the maritime industry may go forward in solving some of the environmental challenges lying ahead. In order to be a success the vessel needed to fulfill three main goals; it needed to be technically feasible, have significantly less emissions to air and sea and be as financially competitive as a conventional VLCC. This paper discusses and shows how the key features of the vessel fulfill these three main goals. The Triality's three main features are; LNG as fuel, no use of ballast water and capture and use of the volatile organic compounds of the cargo (VOC). By utilizing high pressure LNG dual fuel main engines, the vessel maintains the high efficiency of conventional two stroke engines, while at the same time reducing its emissions of CO2, NOx and SOx. By modifying the hull shape and creating a new cargo tank arrangement, the Triality is able to complete is return leg without the use of ballast to submerge its propellers and bow, significantly reducing energy consumption for a round-trip. Finally, the Triality utilizes the cooling energy that comes with the use of LNG as a mean for further increasing the main engines' efficiency and for re-condensation of the cargo vapors. The above features increase the newbuilding cost of the vessel, however due to the reduced fuel costs, the difference in net present value of the Triality compared to a conventional VLCC surmounts 20MUSD.

TI  - Life cycle assessment of CO2 emission reduction potential of carbon capture and utilization for liquid fuel and power cogeneration
AB  - Underground and ocean CO2 storage is facing a series of hazard like leakages, earth movement and seismic activity, which has attracted more international attention on CO2 utilization. It can potentially not only reduce the anthropogenic carbon emissions which is the main cause of climate change, but produce valuable fuels and chemicals through synthesis. This paper explored the environmental benefits of CO2 utilization through the reverse water gas shift into syngas for the production of liquid fuel and power. CO2 source is an ideal three-stage hydrogen production unit based on the Fe-based chemical looping combustion, which can capture carbon with nearly zero-energy-consumption. The life cycle emission was calculated as 129.98 kg CO2-eq/MW h, and the proportion of carbon emissions that correspond to the production of liquid fuel is 60\% (taking exergy allocation as an example). Compared with the conventional NGCC and GTL standalone production system with carbon capture at same outputs, this system could achieve an energy savings of 18.19\% and a life-cycle carbon emission reduction rate of 46.87\%. Carbon emissions mainly came from natural gas mining and transportation, and the CO2 recompression process, which accounts for 74.54\% and 15.12\% of life cycle emissions, respectively. In addition, the effects of key parameters, such as CCU/CCS, solid inventory and lifetime of oxygen carrier, and different allocation methods, on these LCA results were discussed in detail to further reveal the system carbon emission reduction potential.

TI  - An integrated energy conversion and storage facility for offshore wind and wave energy exploitation along the west coasts of North America and Europe
AB  - An integrated energy conversion and storage facility based on a floating foundation is introduced. It consists of an on-board 10 MW wind turbine and eighteen wave energy capturing buoys along the front of a floating foundation, with pumped hydro-energy storage. The proposed floating foundation is designed for waters off the west coasts of North America and Europe, where strong winds and high waves prevail. To operate the wind turbine safely, the design provides viable performance in waves and possesses the hydrodynamic attribute of being a wave amplifier such that the buoys may capture twice as much wave energy as in open water. The proposed wave energy capture and conversion design provide both protection against breaking wave impacts and good access for repair and maintenance, heretofore two major technical obstacles in the way of offshore wave energy exploitation. As shown by rough assessment of the proposed floating facility, its improved cost effectiveness may allow a major move from onshore to offshore wind turbines. Since the levelized cost of onshore wind farms is about equal to conventional coal plants and roughly 30% lower than an advanced coal plant with carbon dioxide capture and storage, the proposed offshore facility may prove a viable, large scale alternative to coal plants since available land and wind resource are somewhat limited for onshore wind farms.

TI  - Marine Monitoring for Offshore Geological Carbon Storage-A Review of Strategies, Technologies and Trends
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) could significantly contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reaching international climate goals. In this process, CO2 is captured and injected into geological formations for permanent storage. The injected plume and its migration within the reservoir is carefully monitored, using geophysical methods. While it is considered unlikely that the injected CO2 should escape the reservoir and reach the marine environment, marine monitoring is required to verify that there are no indications of leakage, and to detect and quantify leakage if it should occur. Marine monitoring is challenging because of the considerable area to be covered, the limited spatial and temporal extent of a potential leakage event, and the considerable natural variability in the marine environment. In this review, we summarize marine monitoring strategies developed to ensure adequate monitoring of the marine environment without introducing prohibitive costs. We also provide an overview of the many different technologies applicable to different aspects of marine monitoring of geologically stored carbon. Finally, we identify remaining knowledge gaps and indicate expected directions for future research.

TI  - Operating experience of desulfurization process and pre-combustion co2 capture process integrated with coal gasifier
AB  - SEWGS (Sorption Enhanced Water Gas Shift) process is one of options for pre-combustion CO2 capture using dry absorbent and water gas shift catalyst. In this process, the thermodynamic equilibrium in the shift reaction can be enhanced to give more hydrogen yield by adding a CO2 absorbent into the shift reactor. Total integrated system consists of coal gasifier, warm gas cleanup process (two interconnected fluidized bed desulfurizer), and one loop SEWGS process. In this paper, continuous operation results of the warm gas cleanup process and one loop SEWGS process using dry absorbents at high temperature and pressure conditions were discussed. Dry absorbents were produced by KEPCO RI (Korea Electric Power Corporation Research Institute) by means of spray-drying method. Continuous operation was performed at high pressure (21 bar for gasifier, 19 bar for warm gas cleanup process, and 17 bar for SEWGS process) and reaction temperature was 550 Â°C for desulfurizer and 240 Â°C for SEWGS reactor. Totally integrated operation was maintained up to 32 hours. We could get high sulfur capture efficiency more than 99 % in the desulfurizer, high CO conversion more than 97 % and CO2 capture efficiency more than 76% in the SEWGS reactor.

TI  - Optimizing monitoring strategies for contrasting offshore CO2 Storage Sites
AB  - A feasibility study for a full scale CCS demonstration project in Norway was conducted in spring 2016, aimed at identifying at least one technically feasible CCS chain (capture, transport and storage). The storage part of the feasibility study investigated three potential storage locations in the North Sea. The main deliverable was a suitability recommendation of the localities, based on technical (capacity and containment) evaluations and an economic assessment. Recommendations for monitoring each potential site were also given in the feasibility study, based on the specific storage reservoir and infrastructure at each site. We discuss optimised sub-surface and environmental monitoring based on regulatory storage requirements, proposing a monitoring plan mainly focussed on seismic and environmental surveys acquired at pre-defined times, such as a baseline prior to CO2 injection, a certain number of surveys acquired during injection, and at least one post-injection survey. These could be towed seismic streamers or a permanent installation, or an optimized combination of the two. In addition, we envisage trigger surveys to be conducted in the case where an anomaly is detected. Continuous downhole pressure gauges in the injection well would provide the primary operational monitoring method, along with conventional surface facility pressure flow rates and compositions.

TI  - Understanding the economic feasibility of ship transport of CO2 within the CCS chain
AB  - An economic model for ship transport of CO2 is developed and benchmarked against published studies. The costs and benefits of ship transport for several likely CCS scenarios are compared against pipeline transport of CO2 for offshore injection. The results show that ship transport can be cost competitive with pipelines. The largest shipping cost components are electricity and fuel, each accounting for almost 30 \% of the total cost. Capital costs only contribute around 28 \% of the total shipping cost, compared to more than 70 \% for pipeline transport. Economies of scale can make shipping more cost-effective over long distances. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Mechanism and process study on steel slag enhancement for CO2 capture by seawater
AB  - Coal-fired power plants, cement plants and steel mills are three major CO2 emitters in the coastal areas of China. To examine potential CO2 reduction techniques in coastal areas, we used seawater as a CO2 absorbent with steel slag added to study the CO2 absorption capacity. An online chromatography apparatus was used to determine CO2 solubility in steel-slag-enhanced seawater, and the thermodynamics and kinetics were studied. CO2 was more soluble in seawater with steel slag than that in seawater alone, and as the concentration of steel slag increased, the CO2 solubility increased and mass transfer coefficient increased, favoring CO2 absorption rate by seawater. CO2 solubility increased on average by 115.56\% when the steel slag increased by 1.0\%. Among steel slag components, MgO had the strongest ability to enhance CO2 capture. CO2 solubility of seawater with 0.4\% MgO was 0.0044 at 25 degrees C and 0.3 MPa. In addition, the combination addition of MgO and CaO had a strong synergistic effect on CO2 capture by seawater. Fe2O3 had a more remarkable capacity to accelerate CO2 capture than other steel slag components. The process was simulated by Aspen Plus to study the optimum operating conditions on the CO2-seawater-steel slag system. The optimum conditions (a liquid-gas mass ratio of 260, absorber temperature of 30 degrees C, absorber pressure of 1 atm, and steel slag-gas ratio of 0.10) ensured that CO2 absorption capacity was above 90\% with low energy consumption and cost. Moreover two-thirds of the CO2 was captured and stored in calcium carbonate form. This process can provide CO2 capture and storage for coastal areas.

TI  - tce: United Kingdom: UK submits 12 energy projects for EU funding
AB  - The UK government has presented applications for 12 low-carbon energy projects to compete for funding from the EU's multibillion-euro New Entrant Reserve scheme. Known as NER300 the scheme will fund a maximum of three projects per member state and provide investment for up to half of each project. The CCS projects vying for funding include Alstom consortium's new oxyfuel supercritical coal-fired power station on the Drax site in North Yorkshire; C Gen's integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power station with pre-combustion CCS in Killingholme, Yorkshire; Progressive Energy consortium's pre-combustion coal gasification project on Teesside; and the Don Valley project's IGCC power station in Stainforth, Yorkshire. The other three CCS projects are in Scotland and comprise SSE Generation's post-combustion capture process, which would retrofit a combined cycle gas-turbine power station in Peterhead; Scottish Power Generation's post-combustion amine capture process, which would be added to the existing sub-critical coal-fired power station at Longannet; and Peel Energy's post-combustion amine capture process, which would be applied to a new supercritical coal-fired power station in Ayrshire. The five remaining renewables projects include one offshore wind farm and four tidal schemes.

TI  - Feeding a Gas Turbine with Aluminum Plant Exhaust for Increased CO2 Concentration in Capture Plant
AB  - Aluminum production contributes to global CO2 emissions both due to the production process itself and due to the generation of electric power required for aluminum production. A concept is presented for increasing the CO2 concentration in the aluminum exhaust from âˆ¼1% to âˆ¼5% through the feeding of aluminum plant exhaust gas to a natural gas combined cycle (NGCC). The specific energy demand for CO2 capture is therewith reduced for both the aluminum plant and the NGCC. An evaluation was made of the impact the aluminum exhaust gas may have on the gas turbine and it is estimated that the most critical issues are corrosion due to SO2 in the aluminum plant exhaust gas and gas turbine inlet filter saturation, since the exhaust gas is saturated with seawater after the wet scrubber. A gas turbine inlet filter was tested for a period of five weeks, but a longer filter test period would be required for verifying filter integrity over time. In order to proceed, the viability of the concept should be evaluated by a gas turbine manufacturer. An alternative concept to evaluate for concentration of CO2 emissions could be to feed the aluminum plant exhaust gas to a boiler in a steam power plant. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Solvents for Membrane-Based Post-Combustion CO2 Capture for Potential Application in the Marine Environment
AB  - Carbon capture on-board ships represents a powerful technological measure in order for the shipping industry to meet the very stringent GHG emission reduction requirements. Operation within the ship environment introduces a number of constraints associated mainly with space, energy supply, and safety which have to be addressed using compact yet efficient solutions. To this end, solvent-based membrane CO2 capture offers several advantages and has the necessary technological maturity for on-board installation. Solvent choice remains a critical issue both for reasons associated with process efficiency as well as on-board safety. In this paper, we present an up-to-date comprehensive review of the different solvents that can be used for post-combustion CO2 capture. Furthermore, we investigated the solvents' performance as determined by their inherent characteristics, properties, and behavior for a range of operating conditions against the strict shipping requirements. A preliminary qualitative comparative assessment was carried out based on appropriately selected key performance indicators (KPIs) pertinent to the requirements of the shipping industry. The identified solvent classes were compared using the most critical KPIs for system integration with the ship. It was concluded that at present, no solvent category can efficiently address all the requirements of the ship. However, widely used solvents such as secondary amines showed relatively good compatibility with the majority of the introduced KPIs. On the other hand, more recently developed molecules, such as phase change solvents and ionic liquids, can easily prevail over the vast majority of the identified solvents as long as they are brought to the same level of technological maturity with benchmark solvents. Such a conclusion points toward the need for accelerating research on more tailor-made and performance-targeted solvents.

TI  - Unconventional CO2 Storage: CO2 Mineral Trapping Predicted in Characterized Shales, Sandstones, and Coal Seam Interburden
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture from industrial sources including coal combustion, gas processing, cement or steel production, blue hydrogen, or direct air capture, and subsequent geological storage is part of the transition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Unconventional and conventional reservoirs provide opportunities for beneficial use such as enhanced recovery, supercritical CO2 (ScCO2) fracturing, and storage of gases such as CO2 and ancillary gases, or potentially hydrogen. The purpose of this study is to use Australian unconventional rock packages to understand the controls on CO2 reactivity and mineral trapping (the most secure form of storage) and compare the potential for CO2 storage. Characterization of core from the Surat, Eromanga, and Cooper basins, Australia, is used to populate CO2 and production water-rock reactivity models. Sensitivity to production water composition and temperature was also tested. Coal seam gas (CSG) reservoir interburden ranged from clay-rich mudstones to interlaminated sandstone and mudstone, and calcite cemented sandstones. The coal seam interburden samples contained high plagioclase and chlorite content. They were predicted to alter to carbonates calcite, ankerite, siderite, and dawsonite mineral trapping CO2. After 30 years, net mineral trapping varied from -0.1 to +0.3 kg CO2/m(3), and pH was 4.6-4.9. Net mineral trapping after 1,000 years varied from 5.7 to 16.3 kg CO2/m(3) and was 17.1 kg CO2/m(3) with higher salinity water. The mineral content had the main control with different lithologies decreasing mineral trapping by 41 or 35\% compared with a base case. Overlying plagioclase-rich sandstone trapped 17.1 kg CO2/m(3) as calcite, ankerite, dawsonite, and siderite after 1,000 years with the pH increasing to 6. For the quartz.-rich oil reservoir sandstone, however, only 0.3 kg CO2/m(3) was trapped after 1,000 years. Gas shale and marine black oil shales contained high mica, chlorite, and feldspar content that could be converted to carbonate minerals, mineral trapping CO2. A marine black oil shale mineral trapped 8.3 and 13.9 kg CO2/m(3) after 30 and 1,000 years, respectively, as siderite and ankerite. Unconventional reservoirs have a strong potential for mineral trapping during CO2 storage.

TI  - Implications of the New EU Maritime Emission Monitoring Regulation on Ship Transportation of CO2
AB  - In the framework of the CCSP R&amp;D program, the regulatory gaps have been assessed at VTT using the current monitoring rules for capture, pipeline transportation and geological storage of CO2 as a benchmark. The scope of the presented work includes: (i) definition of CO2 emissions from ship transportation of CO2; (ii) review of EU regulations on MRV of maritime CO2 emissions; and (iii) review of the MRV regulation on capture, transport and geological storage of CO2 under the EU-ETS. The considered activities related to ship transportation of CO2 are liquefaction and intermediate storage with recirculation loop for boil-off CO2, loading and unloading facilities and CO2 transportation and handling during the ship voyage. Identification of the regulatory gaps, based on the above, shows what is needed to enable ship transportation of CO2 for geological storage in Europe. Based on the results, maritime transportation for CCS could be made possible with very limited new emission monitoring and verification practices. Also the trade-offs of using an MRV regulation analogous to pipeline transportation of CO2 is discussed in the results. Â© 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Detection and impacts of leakage from sub-seafloor deep geological carbon dioxide storage
AB  - Fossil fuel power generation and other industrial emissions of carbon dioxide are a threat to global climate(1), yet many economies will remain reliant on these technologies for several decades(2). Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) in deep geological formations provides an effective option to remove these emissions from the climate system(3). In many regions storage reservoirs are located offshore(4,5), over a kilometre or more below societally important shelf seas(6). Therefore, concerns about the possibility of leakage(7,8) and potential environmental impacts, along with economics, have contributed to delaying development of operational CCS. Here we investigate the detectability and environmental impact of leakage from a controlled sub-seabed release of CO2. We show that the biological impact and footprint of this small leak analogue (<1 tonne CO2 d(-1)) is confined to a few tens of metres. Migration of CO2 through the shallow seabed is influenced by near-surface sediment structure, and by dissolution and re-precipitation of calcium carbonate naturally present in sediments. Results reported here advance the understanding of environmental sensitivity to leakage and identify appropriate monitoring strategies for full-scale carbon storage operations.

TI  - Scenarios and new technologies for a North-European CO2 transport infrastructure in 2050
AB  - This paper assesses possible scenarios for Northern Europe for transportation of CO2 in 2050 as part of a CCS infrastructure, giving focus on off-shore transportation. In addition, the possibility and costs for utilizing the solid Scandinavian bedrock for intermediate storage of CO2 is preliminarily assessed. The preliminary results indicate that an underground storage unit of 50 000 m(3) or larger would have a significantly smaller investment cost than a similarly-sized steel tank storage complex. The cost for transporting CO2 from Finland to final geological CO2 storage sites abroad is higher compared to that from the coastal regions in countries around the North Sea. However, by joint transport infrastructure projects the industry and power production around the presented regions can reach significant cost reductions for CO2 transport. The ship transport infrastructure benefits from a model where nearby capture plants are connected by pipelines to exporting terminal hubs. Trunklines towards geological storage sites are especially cost efficient in the CO2 emission intensive regions close to the North Sea. The on-shore storage potential in western Latvia would also provide a promising opportunity for CO2 trunklines from other Baltics and from Finland. In the heavily CO2 emitting regions of northern Germany, the local on-shore storage accessed by trunklines from the surrounding areas would provide very competitive CO2 transport infrastructure for the local industry and power production. The results indicate that shared CO2 transportation infrastructure by ships would often be the best transport option from the Baltic Sea region to final storage sites at the North Sea. Especially the heavily industrialized regions on the shore of the Gulf of Finland can benefit from a shared transport infrastructure (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A novel coal-based polygeneration system cogenerating power, natural gas and liquid fuel with CO2 capture
AB  - In this paper, a novel coal-based polygeneration system has been proposed, in which power, natural gas and liquid fuel are cogenerated and 62% of carbon is captured. Through proper adjustment instead of full adjustment of the syngas component, the CO/H2 of the unreacted gas in methanol synthesis unit can exactly meet the CO/H2 requirement for SNG synthesis, and thus cogeneration of methanol and SNG can be realized easily. By adopting partial recycle instead of full recycle of the unreacted gas in chemical island, the sharp increase of energy consumption for chemical synthesis can be avoided. On the other hand, part of the unreacted gas from methanol synthesis unit, which is hard to be converted, together with the recovery gas in chemical islands will be sent to combustion for power generation efficiently. At the same time, 62% of the carbon has been captured by low-temperature methanol wash method (LTMW) after concentration. As a result, the thermal efficiency of the novel system is around 54.9%, and the exergy efficiency is about 57.3%, which is much higher than the IGCC system, or single methanol synthesis system. Compared with the conventional single product systems, primary energy saving ratio of this novel polygeneration system can reach as high as 10.8 percent. Based on the graphical exergy analysis, the key processes of the new system are disclosed and the internal phenomena for high performance are revealed. The promising results obtained in this coal-based system may realize both the low-energy-penalty decarburization of coal and highefficient coal utilization, and will possibly provide a new option to enforce the safety of energy supply for countries with abundant coal resources but lack of natural gas and oils.

TI  - Potential impact of CO2 on subsurface microbial ecosystems and implications for the performance of storage reservoirs
AB  - Studies of the potential environmental consequences of carbon capture and storage (CCS) have, to date, focused on the physical and chemical impacts of CO2 within stable geological formations together with associated monitoring systems to assure that no significant leakage occurs. If leakage did occur after formal closure of the injection site, this is likely to be restricted to discrete point sources, such as abandoned wells, resulting in locally high concentrations of CO2 in near-surface ecosystems. Consequently, environmental impacts of localised elevated CO2 on terrestrial and marine ecosystems are areas of active research. However, the CO2 storage site could also impact on the deep subsurface microbial ecosystem and biogeochemical processes. This paper describes short pilot studies (2136 h/89 days) investigating the changes in physical transport properties that are mediated by microbial activity, within samples of sandstone under experimental conditions simulating deep aquifer and reservoir environments in the North Sea. They showed, for the first time, that P. aeruginosa and indigenous microbial populations can survive exposure to saline fluids saturated with CO2. However, little impact on fluid transport under these conditions in these short experiments was observed. It is possible that the microbes require a period of acclimatisation to the extreme environmental conditions generated by the presence of CO2 before any impacts can be detected. Thus, long-term experiments are needed to clarify the role of microbes on rock transport properties. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. Open access under CC BY-NC-ND license.

TI  - THE FULL FUEL-CYCLE OF CO2 CAPTURE AND DISPOSAL .3. AFFORESTATION, AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
AB  - This paper reports on the assessment and valuation of the environmental impacts arising from the full fuel cycles of three fossil fuelled power plants equipped with CO2 capture and disposal facilities. The first of these is a Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) plant featuring CO2 separation and disposal to a disused gas well. The second is an Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plant featuring CO2 separation and disposal to the deep ocean. The third case is a pulverised fuel plant with flue gas desulphurisation (PF+FGD) with CO2 capture by a managed forest at a site remote from the power plant. A wide variety of impacts have been assessed at local, regional and global scales. They include accidents affecting workers and the public, the effects of atmospheric emissions on health and buildings and the impacts of global warming. Issues associated with management of the forest designed to capture CO2 from the PF plant and assessment of the associated costs are also described.

TI  - A novel sub-seabed CO2 release experiment informing monitoring and impact assessment for geological carbon storage
AB  - Carbon capture and storage is a mitigation strategy that can be used to aid the reduction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. This process aims to capture CO2 from large point-source emitters and transport it to a long-term storage site. For much of Europe, these deep storage sites are anticipated to be sited below the sea bed on continental shelves. A key operational requirement is an understanding of best practice of monitoring for potential leakage and of the environmental impact that could result from a diffusive leak from a storage complex. Here we describe a controlled CO2 release experiment beneath the seabed, which overcomes the limitations of laboratory simulations and natural analogues. The complex processes involved in setting up the experimental facility and ensuring its successful operation are discussed, including site selection, permissions, communications and facility construction. The experimental design and observational strategy are reviewed with respect to scientific outcomes along with lessons learnt in order to facilitate any similar future. (C) 2014 The Authors.

TI  - Recent advances in carbon-based renewable adsorbent for selective carbon dioxide capture and separation-A review
AB  - In terms of net intensification in the greenhouse effect ie., rise of global temperature which has triggered melting of glacier thus increasing sea level and acidification of sea, carbon dioxide alone contributes approximately three-fourth of the net greenhouse radiative forcing by man-made (anthropogenic) greenhouse gases emissions. Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technology; a promising strategy for capturing of carbon dioxide from point sources before its release to atmosphere by using various sorbents is gaining global interest. In this study, the established carbon capture technologies with methods of carbon dioxide separation along there pros and cons are discussed. Carbon-based adsorbents are considered as the most versatile adsorbents for carbon dioxide due to their extraordinary physical and chemical properties. In this manuscript, recent developments on carbonaceous adsorbents (biochar, activated carbons, and graphene-based adsorbents) and their role in carbon dioxide capture during different combustion processes and conditions have been comprehensively focused.

TI  - Evaluating CMIP5 ocean biogeochemistry and Southern Ocean carbon uptake using atmospheric potential oxygen: Present-day performance and future projection
AB  - Observed seasonal cycles in atmospheric potential oxygen (APO ~ O2 + 1.1 CO2) were used to evaluate eight ocean biogeochemistry models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Model APO seasonal cycles were computed from the CMIP5 air-sea O2 and CO2 fluxes and compared to observations at three Southern Hemisphere monitoring sites. Four of the models captured either the observed APO seasonal amplitude or phasing relatively well, while the other four did not. Many models had an unrealistic seasonal phasing or amplitude of the CO2 flux, which in turn influenced APO. By 2100 under RCP8.5, the models projected little change in the O2 component of APO but large changes in the seasonality of the CO2 component associated with ocean acidification. The models with poorer performance on present-day APO tended to project larger net carbon uptake in the Southern Ocean, both today and in 2100. Â© 2016. American Geophysical Union.

TI  - Joint generation and demand-side management for shipboard carbon capture and storage system
AB  - Currently, lots of research have revealed the great potentials of the land-based carbon capture and storage (CCS) system on the control of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. But when it comes to the shipboard applications, the CCS integration becomes rather complicated since very limited operating conditions onboard, especially for the shortage of power supply. Nowadays, the all-electric ship (AES), which uses electricity to meet both the propulsion and service loads, has become a trend for future ship designing due to higher efficiency and flexibility, as well as providing a better platform for CCS integration and paving a new way for maritime GHG emission control. To address the power shortage issue led by the CCS integration, this paper first incorporates the demand-side management on the propulsion load and a corresponding joint generation and demand-side management model is proposed. The mathematical model is formulated as a bi-level optimization after certain constraint decomposition and solved by the column and constraint generation algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, the proposed method is able to relieve the power shortage issue of shipboard CCS, and the corresponding carbon capture level increases from 86% to 93%.

The electricity will be generated by solar cell in the deserts and used for production of hydrogen by seawater electrolysis at the nearby desert coasts. Hydrogen with no existing infrastructures for transportation and combustion will be converted to methane at the desert coasts by the reaction with carbon dioxide captured by energy consumers. Among systems in global carbon dioxide recycling, seawater electrolysis and carbon dioxide methanation have not been performed industrially.

TI  - Mathematical modelling of permeability reduction in porous media caused by CO2 hydrate formation using microscopic phase-field model simulations
AB  - Carbon capture and storage is a promising technique for reducing significant amount of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is stored in aquifers under the seabed, although there is a risk of leakage that may pose some influence on the marine environment. Gas hydrate has ice-like structures formed by the enclosure of gas molecules by water molecule cages. CO2 hydrate can be formed under the conditions of high pressure and low temperature, such as in sub-seabed shallow formations in the deep sea. If CO2 leaks from sub-seabed aquifers and rises in the geological formation upto a depth where hydrate is formed, the hydrate can suppress or even block the outflow. To use gas hydrate more positively, another approach has been advocated in which CO2 is injected directly into the hydrate stability zone and is stored in the form of gas hydrate. This study provides a mathematical model of the permeability reduction caused by hydrate formation, using microscopic numerical simulations of hydrate formation on the pore scale. Virtual sand sediments were created numerically using the CT scan data of the Toyoura sand and the particle growth method. The phase-field model was used to simulate hydrate growth, and the lattice Boltzmann method was used to calculate the permeability reduction. Various values of porosity and initial water saturation were considered to investigate their influences on the hydrate growth and the subsequent permeability reduction. The proposed mathematiical model for the permeability reduction was able to capture the overall behaviour of the simulated results, suggesting its applicability as a submodel of reservoir-scale simulations.

TI  - An object-base modeling and simulation of CO 2 plume dynamic in saline formation in Nam vang field, Cuu Long basin, Vietnam
AB  - In recent years, Carbon capture and storage technology (CCS) has been recognized as one of the potential methods to reduce greenhouse gas emission and for mitigating global climate change. This practice can be done in the depleted reservoir as well as saline aquifer reservoir. Geological modeling is an important process to prove the suitable geologic formation in CCS project. The CO2 plume behavior depends on geology structure of storage formation. This study focuses on geological modeling and the simulation of CO2 plume behavior in saline sandstone of fluvial deposit, Nam Vang field, Cuu Long Basin, Vietnam. Channel sand and floodplain are defined based on well-logging data. Fluvial facies are distributed in the three-dimensional grid by using the object-based method with consideration of lateral continuity, vertical range and orientation in each facies. The porosity and permeability are modeled stochastically to conditioning to facies. The advantage of object-based modeling constrained the petrophysical model to facies model to assign the high porosities and permeability distributed within channel sand-dominated facies. The low porosities and permeability populated within floodplain-dominated facies. CO 2 injections were simulated using ECLIPSE300-CO2STORE. Sensitivity analysis has been conducted to investigate the behavior of CO2 plume for reservoir saline sandstone. Simulation results indicate the extent of CO2 plume dynamic is sensitivity to the geometry and sinuosity of the fluvial channel. The object-based modeling can construct the geological model to relate with fluvial channel facies correctly. This method is used to support for geological CO2 storage modeling in the fluvial deposit. As a general evaluation, this study can contribute to CO2 storage in an offshore area in Vietnam.

TI  - Efficient marine environmental characterisation to support monitoring of geological CO2 storage
AB  - Carbon capture and storage is key for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, and offshore geological formations provide vast CO2 storage potential. Monitoring of sub-seabed CO2 storage sites requires that anomalies signifying a loss of containment be detected, and if attributed to storage, quantified and their impact assessed. However, monitoring at or above the seabed is only useful if one can reliably differentiate abnormal signals from natural variability. Baseline acquisition is the default option for describing the natural state, however we argue that a comprehensive baseline assessment is likely expensive and time-bound, given the multi-decadal nature of CCS operations and the dynamic heterogeneity of the marine environment. We present an outline of the elements comprising an efficient marine environmental baseline to support offshore monitoring. We demonstrate that many of these elements can be derived from pre-existing and ongoing sources, not necessarily related to CCS project development. We argue that a sufficient baseline can be achieved by identifying key emergent properties of the system rather than assembling an extensive description of the physical, chemical and biological states. Further, that contemporary comparisons between impacted and non-impacted sites are likely to be as valuable as before and after comparisons. However, as these emergent properties may be nuanced between sites and seasons and comparative studies need to be validated by the careful choice of reference site, a site-specific understanding of the scales of heterogeneity will be an invaluable component of a baseline.

TI  - Keynote: Comparing Benefits of CO2 storage and CO@EOR from a Climate Mitigation Perspective
AB  - Over the coming decades our society has a significant challenge in achieving globally significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Numerous studies show that large-scale geologic disposal of CO2 from industrial emissions will be essential to achieve this objective. There are currently 21 large-scale CCS facilities in operation. Of these large-scale CCS projects, five use geologic storage in saline formations (Sleipner, SnÃ¸hvit, Quest, IBDP & Gorgon) and together inject nearly 6 million tonnes CO2 per annum (Mtpa). The remaining large-scale projects mainly use CO2EOR as the storage vehicle. Enhanced oil recovery using carbon dioxide (CO2EOR) can have a dual purpose: (a) To recover additional oil, thereby supplying energy and additional revenues; and (b) to mitigate climate change by reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Historically, CO2EOR projects have tended to maximize oil production as a function of the CO2 injected. There are various options proposed to enhance the climate mitigation effect of CO2EOR projects by maximizing the ratio of the CO2 injected to the oil produced, or by transiting projects from CO2EOR in the initial stages to pure storage projects in the later stages. However, to achieve net zero-emissions, CO2EOR projects need to include a significant fraction of non-EOR CO2 storage. CO2EOR projects also play an important role in building the infrastructure needed for large-scale carbon capture, utilisation, and storage. We illustrate these potential pathways using examples of large CCUS/CCS projects, both from offshore Norway and onshore Canada. Â© IOR 2021 - 21st European Symposium on Improved Oil Recovery.

TI  - On physical mechanisms enhancing air-sea CO2 exchange
AB  - Reducing uncertainties in the air-sea CO2 flux calculations is one of the major challenges when addressing the oceanic contribution in the global carbon balance. In traditional models, the air-sea CO2 flux is estimated using expressions of the gas transfer velocity as a function of wind speed. However, other mechanisms affecting the variability in the flux at local and regional scales are still poorly understood. The uncertainties associated with the flux estimates become particularly large in heterogeneous environments such as coastal and marginal seas. Here, we investigated the air-sea CO2 exchange at a coastal site in the central Baltic Sea using 9 years of eddy covariance measurements. Based on these observations we were able to capture the temporal variability in the air-sea CO2 flux and other parameters relevant for the gas exchange. Our results show that a wind-based model with a similar pattern to those developed for larger basins and open-sea conditions can, on average, be a good approximation for k, the gas transfer velocity. However, in order to reduce the uncertainty associated with these averages and produce reliable short-term k estimates, additional physical processes must be considered. Using a normalized gas transfer velocity, we identified conditions associated with enhanced exchange (large k values). During high and intermediate wind speeds (above 6-8 ms(-1)), conditions on both sides of the air-water interface were found to be relevant for the gas exchange. Our findings further suggest that at such relatively high wind speeds, sea spray is an efficient mechanisms for air-sea CO2 exchange. During low wind speeds (< 6 ms(-1)), water-side convection was found to be a relevant control mechanism. The effect of both sea spray and water-side convection on the gas exchange showed a clear seasonality with positive fluxes (winter conditions) being the most affected.

TI  - Feasibility study of "CO2-free hydrogen energy supply chain" utilizing Australian brown coal linked with CCS
AB  - Efforts to reduce CO2 emissions have been accelerated all over the world in an attempt to move toward a low-carbon society. We have investigated feasible measures to reduce CO2 emissions and have concluded that introduction of new fuels with near-zero CO2 emissions is required to achieve Japan's commitment of 80% CO2 reduction by 2050. Although it was originally thought that nuclear power is promising in this regard, it is difficult to increase nuclear power at the moment, especially in Japan. Although much attention has been paid to renewable energies like solar or wind power, these problems concerning the stability and mass supply still exist. Therefore, we have moved forward with focus on hydrogen. The use of hydrogen will not produce CO2 emissions, and the production of hydrogen produces limited CO2 emissions. In this context, we aim to realize a CO2-free hydrogen chain utilizing Australian brown coal linked with CCS (carbon capture and storage). Australia has abundant resources of unused brown coal and the Federal Government of Australia and the State Government of Victoria actively encourage effective use of brown coal. Simultaneously, they energetically promote plans for a CO2 storage hub (Carbon Net), led mainly by Victoria. This enables stable, economic production of CO2-free hydrogen. In a CO2-free hydrogen chain, hydrogen is produced from brown coal in Australia and then the hydrogen is liquefied and transported to Japan by a liquid hydrogen carrier. It is the world's first attempt to transport massive amounts of liquid hydrogen across the ocean. We have conducted a feasibility study on the CO2-free hydrogen chain at a commercial scale and the results show that this chain concept is technically and economically feasible.

TI  - Differing responses of the estuarine bivalve Limecola balthica to lowered water pH caused by potential CO2 leaks from a sub-seabed storage site in the Baltic Sea: An experimental study
AB  - Sub-Seabed CCS is regarded as a key technology for the reduction of CO2 emissions, but little is known about the mechanisms through which leakages from storage sites impact benthic species. In this study, the biological responses of the infaunal bivalve Limecola balthica to CO2-induced seawater acidification (pH 7.7, 7.0, and 6.3) were quantified in 56-day mesocosm experiments. Increased water acidity caused changes in behavioral and physiological traits, but even the most acidic conditions did not prove to be fatal. In response to hypercapnia, the bivalves approached the sediment surface and increased respiration rates. Lower seawater pH reduced shell weight and growth, while it simultaneously increased soft tissue weight; this places L. balthica in a somewhat unique position among marine invertebrates.

TI  - Pressurization and brine displacement issues for deep saline formation CO2 storage
AB  - Deep saline formations are expected to store gigatonnes of CO2 over the coming decades, making a significant contribution to greenhouse gas mitigation. At present, our experience of deep saline formation storage is limited to a small number of demonstration projects that have successfully injected megatonnes of captured CO2. However, concerns have been raised over pressurization, and related brine displacement, in deep saline formations, given the anticipated scale of future storage operations. Whilst industrial-scale demonstration projects such as Sleipner and In Salah have not experienced problems, generic flow models have indicated that, in some cases, pressure may be an issue. The problem of modeling deep saline formation pressurization has been approached in a number of different ways by researchers, with published analytical and numerical solutions showing a wide range of outcomes. The divergence of results (either supporting or negating the pressurization issue) principally reflects the a priori choice of boundary conditions. These approaches can be summed up as either 'open' or 'closed': a) open system models allow the formation pressure to dissipate laterally, resulting in reasonable storage scenarios; b) closed system models predict pressurization, resulting in a loss of injectivity and/or storage formation leakage. The latter scenario predicts that storage sites will commonly fail to accommodate the injected CO2 at a rate sufficient to handle routine projects. Our models aim to demonstrate that pressurization and brine displacement need to be addressed at a regional scale with geologically accurate boundary conditions. Given that storage formations are unlikely to have zero-flow boundaries (closed system assumption), the boundary contribution to pressure relief from low permeability shales may be significant. At a field scale, these shales are effectively perfect seals with respect to multiphase flow, but are open with respect to single phase flow and pressure dissipation via brine displacement at a regional scale. This is sometimes characterized as a 'semi-closed' system. It follows that the rate at which pressure can be dissipated (and CO2 injected) is highly sensitive to the shale permeability. A common range from submillidarcy (10-17 m2) to sub-nanodarcy (10-22 m2) is considered, and the empirical relationships of permeability with respect to porosity and threshold pressure are reviewed in light of the regional scale of CO2 storage in deep saline formations. Our model indicates that a boundary permeability of about a microdarcy (10-18 m2) is likely to provide sufficient pressure dissipation via brine displacement to allow for routine geological storage. The models also suggest that nanodarcy shales (10 -21 m2) will result in significant pressurization. There is regional evidence, from the North Sea, that typical shale permeabilities at depths associated with CO2 storage (1-3 km) are likely to favor storage, relegating pressurization to a manageable issue.

TI  - Transport of CO2 in the Nordic region
AB  - NORDICCS is a virtual CCS networking platform aiming for increased CCS deployment in the five Nordic countries. This paper reports from work investigating options for CO2 transport infrastructure in the Nordic region. Five specific CCS cases have been selected from which capture is analyzed in detail and from which CO2 transport cost has been calculated assuming CO2 being captured only at the site itself or, assuming the selected capture site develops into a CO2-hub with CO2 from several adjacent sources. In the latter case cost has been calculated defining for what volumes pipeline transport becomes less costly than corresponding ship transport. Additionally, cost for both pipeline and ship transport has been calculated as a function of distance and volume in order to apply these calculations to derive the least costly transport mode for the fifty-five largest sources in the region with a coastal location. Also, the effect on cost for systems that will require ramp-up (i.e. transported volumes increase over time) has been calculated. Finally, an analysis of the potential for build-up of clusters in the region was performed. The work clearly shows that ship transport is the least costly transport option, not only for the five selected cases individually but also for most of the emission sources located along the coastline. The work also shows that ship transport is the least costly transport option for most of the potential clusters in the region during the ramp-up phase. An obvious but still important conclusion is that constrained storage capability and injectivity may have a profound impact on design and cost of a CO2 transport system. (C) 2014 The Authors.

TI  - Setting a new benchmark in ROP and bit durability in the pre-salt section carbonate rocks of the deepwater mero field in Brazil
AB  - This work explains the process of how a bit was designed specifically to address drilling challenges of the reservoir section of the Mero Field offshore Brazil. The performance of this new bit is compared to previous bits used in the field. A systematic process to design and evaluate the performance of a new bit involves interaction with the operator to understand the challenges and gather information, evaluate previous bit performances, use software to simulate the new bit design based on drilling conditions in the field, manufacture the bit according to design specifications, run the bit according to planned parameters, capture and report results, and evaluate results to identify possible improvements. The reservoir section has a high hardness and is primarily composed of calcareous rock and silica intercalations. Since the discovery of the Mero Field, more than 17 wells have been drilled by different companies. In the majority of the wells, the reservoir section was drilled using impregnated bits and turbines. As a result, the application of a systematic process was used to solve operator challenges where a new bit was designed and run in the field to drill the reservoir section of two wells. A comparison was performed between the previous bits used in the field and the new bit concept, certifying that the new bit reduced the reservoir section drilling time by 59%. This work discusses improved drilling efficiency in the reservoir section by drilling with a new bit design in a field where only impregnated bits and turbines were used. This created a new benchmark for drilling performance in the Mero Field. Â© 2019, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - Aerobic and anoxic biodegradability of amines applied in CO2-capture
AB  - Integrated and sustainable waste handling is becoming essential in large scale employment of amine-based post combustion CO2 capture and storage (CCS). We have previously proven the feasibility of biological nitrogen removal of amines in a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) in pre-denitrification mode, thereby serving as a carbon source for denitrification. To evaluate novel solvents, it is essential to test their biodegradability under anoxic conditions. Generally, biodegradability is assessed by standardized aerobic tests, but no equivalent method is available for anoxic degradation. Therefore, a new anoxic batch screening test in syringes was used, measuring the headspace volume expansion due to produced N-2 gas over time. Aerobic biodegradability was measured the conventional way by determining the biological oxygen demand (BOD). Nine different amine samples were tested, including monoethanolamine (MEA) and reclaimer waste. Comparison of biodegradability under aerobic fresh and sea water conditions showed generally improved biodegradation in fresh water. The anoxic screening identified subgroups of amines classified as a) easily degradable, b) slowly degradable and c) undegraded. The results show that BOD alone cannot be relied upon as the only parameter to describe biodegradability. Our anoxic biodegradability test provides essential information on potential carbon sources for denitrification in MBBR and describes the biodegradation kinetics involved.

TI  - Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage: How carbon storage and biomass resources potentials can impact the development of the BECCS
AB  - The challenges of climate change involve rethinking the worldâ€™s energy system. In particular, carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies are still presented as a solution to reach ambitious decarbonization targets, and particularly when associated with bioenergy resources due to the negative emission they allow. However, avoiding the required Gt of CO2 emissions by investing in CCS technologies supposes the development of carbon storage capacities and, when associated with bioenergy, a plausible and sustainable potential of biomass resources. This analysis, conducted with the optimization model TIAM-FR (TIMES Integrated Assessment Model, a bottom-up, long-term, and multiregional model), highlights the role of these elements in the future development of the bioenergy combined with CCS option. More precisely, based, on the one hand, on an advanced methodology of biomass potential assessment, and, on the other hand, on detailed data of storage potential, including onshore and offshore classification, this study shows how such potentials may be a limit to the development of (bioenergy with) CCS technologies. This analysis was performed through various scenarios investigated with different levels of potentials and different climate targets on the long-term. As a complement, we also discuss effects of carbon transport costs variation and implement a scenario allowing the exclusion of onshore storage due to a hypothetic policy considering public resistance to onshore storage.

TI  - International competitiveness of low-carbon hydrogen supply to the Northwest European market
AB  - This paper analyses which sources of low-carbon hydrogen for the Northwest European market are most competitive, taking into account costs of local production, conversion and transport. Production costs of electrolysis are strongly affected by local renewable electricity costs and capacity factors. Transport costs are the lowest by pipelines for distances under 10,000 km, with costs linearly increasing with distance. For larger distances, transport as ammonia is more efficient, with less relation to distance, despite higher conversion costs. The most competitive low-carbon hydrogen supply to the Northwest European market appears to be local Steam Methane Reforming with Carbon Capture and Storage when international gas prices return back to historical levels. When gas prices, however, remain high, then import from Morocco with electrolysis directly connected to offshore wind generation is found to be the most competitive source of low-carbon hydrogen. These conclusions are robust for various assumptions on costs and capacity factors. Â© 2022 The Author(s)

BP's projections suggest that the world will need 45% more energy in 2030 than it consumes now, and double current demand by 2050. Nuclear energy and biofuels also will play a part, and carbon capture technology could be commercially deployed by 2030. Investment will flow if policymakers provide a clear and stable framework for investment in both low-carbon energy and fossil fuels. Offshore wind is, too, especially when compared with onshore wind, which is now an attractive business for BP in the US. Hayward said that without a credible and enduring framework, it would not be possible for industry to invest at the scale necessary to maintain.

TI  - Ship-Based Carbon Capture and Storage: A Supply Chain Feasibility Study
AB  - The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) calls for the maritime industry to restrict its CO2 emissions by âˆ’40% (IMO2030) and âˆ’70% (IMO2050). This paper answered the following research question: â€œWhich technical, economic and emissions-related conditions predominantly determine the feasibility of a conceptual supply chain of liquid CO2 that is captured from the exhaust gases of LNG powered offshore vessels?â€ The captured CO2 is transported to land where it is utilized by a final customer. The study followed a systems engineering approach. Problem definition was followed by a requirements analysis (technology, emissions, economy and operations), design with scenarios and a case study with realistic vessel deployment, modeling and evaluation. All designs have technical uncertainties and financial risks, but the sale of captured CO2 could be a crucial advantage of the proposed concept over other concepts. The main conclusion is that emission and financial targets (payback time) can be met by aligning the offshore transportation distance with the capacity to store CO2 on board and the available means of transport to the final user. Specialists from the vessel owner indicate that capturing, storage and off-loading is likely to have minor implications for the vessel availability and regular operations. Â© 2022 by the authors.

TI  - A Critical Review of Power Takeâ€Off Wave Energy Technology Leading to the Conceptual Design of a Novel Waveâ€Plusâ€Photon Energy Harvester for Island/Coastal Communitiesâ€™ Energy Needs
AB  - As the global interest in renewable energy generation continues, the need to develop new and innovative solutions is being explored every day throughout the world by researchers and innovators. Hybrid renewable energy innovations are gaining progressive interest not only because of the threat of climate change but also due to the technological advancements seen in renewables. Ocean waves have immense potential as a renewable energy source, and related technologies have advanced continuously over the past few decades. In response, this paper extensively studies wave energy converters (WECs) based on the power takeâ€off (PTO) technique, and presents a novel hybrid waveâ€plusâ€photon energy (HWPE) harvester called Wavevoltaics, based on wave and solar energy capture systems for coastal communitiesâ€™ power needs, in line with decarbonization measures. The HWPE harvester uses a simple rackâ€andâ€pinion mechanism in combination with solar cell technology to convert the wave energy into usable electrical energy in a water column structural design. This novel HWPE device can be used to provide power for lighting and gadgets for coastal communities that rely heavily on fossil fuels for their lighting and electrical needs. Later in the paper, the challenges faced in hybrid wave energy development are presented. Â© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - NUMERICAL ESTIMATION OF MULTIPLE POSITIONS OF SEEPAGE OF DISSOLVED MATTER FROM SEAFLOOR
AB  - To mitigate global warming, it is necessary to emit less CO2 into the atmosphere and the Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS) attracts attention these days as one of the solutions against the problem. Off Tomakomai coast, Japan, a CCS project has been demonstrated since 2016. However, there may be a risk of CO2 leakage and consequent seepage from the seafloor, even if the probability of such an event is almost nil. In this research, we assumed that CO2 seeps from multiple points on the seafloor and aimed at estimating the seepage locations, time and fluxes, by using CO2 concentration data observed by several sensors set on the seafloor. We adopted the adjoint marginal sensitivity method, which is a probabilistic time-backward method: an adjoint location probability is released by each sensor and spreads in the time-backward direction. The adjoint location probabilities are used to estimate the seepage fluxes. We also combined the least squares method with the adjoint marginal sensitivity method to estimate the seepage fluxes. We considered that CO2 seeps from 2 points in 2-dimensional horizontal domains as test calculations with changing seepage flux ratios, such as 1:1, 1:0.1 or 1:0.01.

TI  - Overcoming CO2 Injector Well Design and Completion Challenges in a Carbonate Reservoir for World's First Offshore Carbon Capture Storage CCS SE Asia Project
AB  - Oil & Gas Operators are focusing on zero carbon emission to comply with government's changing rules and regulations, which play an important role in the encouragement of carbon capture initiatives. This paper aims to give insights on the world's first offshore CCS project in carbonate reservoir, where wells will be drilled to inject CO2, and store produced CO2 from contaminated fields. To safeguard the storage containment, the integrity of all wells needs to be scrutinized. Development wells in the identified depleted gas field are more than 40 years old and were not designed with consideration of high CO2 concentration in the reservoir. In consequence, the possibility of well leakage due to accelerated corrosion channeling and cracks, along the wellbore cannot be ignored and require careful evaluation. Rigorous process has been adopted in assessing the feasibility for converting existing gas producers into CO2 injectors. The required defined basis of designs for gas producer and CO2 injection wells differs in a great extent and this governs the re-usability of wells for CO2 injection or necessity to be abandoned. Three (3) new CO2 injectors with fat to slim design approach, corrosion resistant alloy (CRA) material and CO2 resistant cement are designed in view to achieve lifecycle integrity. Optimum angle of 53 deg and maintaining the injection pressure of 50 bar at 90 MSCFD rate is required for the injection of supercritical CO2 for 20 years. During well execution, challenges such as anti-collision risk, total loss scenarios while drilling in Carbonate reservoir need to be addressed before execution. The completion design is also focusing on having minimal number of completion jewelries to reduce pressure differential and potential leak paths from tubing hangar down to the end of lower completion. The selection of downhole safety valve (TRSV) type is of high importance to accommodate CO2 phase attributes at different pressure/temperature. Fiber Optic is included for monitoring the migration of CO2 plume by acquiring seismic survey and for well integrity by analyzing DAS/DTS data. Â© Copyright 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers

TI  - DEVELOPMENT OF A PERMEABILITY REDUCTION MODEL USING DEEP LEARNING FOR CO2 HYDRATE STORAGE
AB  - Global warming is an important environmental issue, and carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a major technology to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. Captured carbon dioxide (CO2) can be stored in aquifers onshore or offshore seabed regions. Nevertheless, a small risk exists in which CO2 may leak due to natural phenomena opening cracks in the cap-rock. The natural formation of CO2 hydrates may create a new impermeable layer managing to block a possible leakage. It is of utmost necessity to understand and evaluate the permeability change due to the hydrate formation. Numerical simulation on different spatial scales has been essential for this purpose. The main objective of this study is to create a new framework for permeability reduction due to CO2 hydrate formation. Using machine learning, a multiscale approach links a large reservoir scale hydrate formation model with a microscale model. Detailed information from the hydrate shape can be obtained from the microscopic range to predict the new permeability reduction coefficient. Initial results have shown that this approach can obtain the permeability change due to CO2 hydrate formation with reasonable accuracy. Copyright Â© 2022 by ASME.

TI  - No regrets energy options - Choices in a changing climate
AB  - The future inevitable switch to renewable energy sources has always been known to have far reaching implications for the countryside and nature conservation - just as much as current emissions from fossil fuels in the form of acid rain and the greenhouse effect. Without the solar component, renewable sources are largely located in the countryside, either agricultural, in the form of energy crops, or in wilder country, as with wind, hydro and tidal barrages. The RCEP report maps out a strategy for reducing current fossil fuel use by half over 50 years with various combinations of demand reduction and replacement by renewable.1 The report's free summary version should be essential reading. The main thrust of the report is on the technical solutions available to meet global environmental targets - there is little on the implications for Britain's local environment. Four scenarios are used as indicative of the kinds of solutions available: energy demand stabilised at current 1998 levels (no mean feat, considering demand is growing), two scenarios where it is reduced by 36% by 2050, and a maximum demand reduction of 50%. Under these four scenarios, a mix of technologies is proposed to replace fossil fuel supplies. Roughly 200 GW constitutes current energy demand (all sources converted to Watts), and in Scenario 1 this means 100 GW must be replaced - with half coming from renewable sources and half either from fossil fuels with CO2 capture or new nuclear stations, whereas in Scenario 4 that reduces to 50 GW and no nuclear component. In all scenarios, the main sources of supply, as percentages of the renewable component, are biomass (Short Rotation Coppice) at 10-20%, wind (onshore and offshore) at 35-50%, and wave and tidal at 8-30%. The sheer scale of development required to meet these targets is indicated in the numbers of installations outlined below.

TI  - Carbon capture and storage-solidification and storage of CO2 captured on ships
AB  - To meet the IMO (International Maritime Organization) target of 20% reduction of CO2 emissions from marine activities by 2020, application of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) on ships is an effective way to mitigate the CO2 emission while other low carbon shipping technologies are being developed. A comprehensive literature review on CCS methods used onshore has indicated that the current CCS technologies could not be implemented on boards mechanically due to various limitations on ships. In this paper, a novel chemical CO2 absorption and solidification method for CO2 storage onboard is proposed, presented and analyzed. Technical feasibility with principles explanation and cost assessment are carried out for a case ship with a comparison with conventional methods. The paper also presents results obtained from laboratory experiment. Theoretical study and laboratory experiment have shown that the proposed CO2 solidification method is a promising, cost effective and practicable method for CO2 emission reduction on ships.

TI  - Feasibility study of quantifying porosity from seismic data in Smeaheia
AB  - Equinor with Shell and Total, evaluate the feasibility for full-scale CO2 capture and storage project in Norwegian continental shelf. One of the challenges for CO2 storage sites is to assure containment and to assess possible leakage paths to the surface. Understanding the overburdenâ€™s geological setting is crucial for this assessment. As part of the overburden risk assessment, we investigate the potential for quantifying porosity from seismic inversion data. Knowledge of the porosity distributions, may enable us to employ porosity-permeability models in the future to assess leakage pathways into the overburden.

TI  - Innovation Conceptual Design on Carbon Neutrality Deepwater Drilling Platform
AB  - Deepwater drilling platform consumes much chemical and petroleum sources to provide sufficient energy for drilling services, which produces a large amount of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere directly. To reduce the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and achieve the carbon neutrality target, carbon neutrality deepwater drilling platform concept is proposed. The carbon dioxide emissions need be captured and stored on the seabed. Some innovation conceptual designs for Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) on deepwater drilling platform are conducted and present. An integrated design concept for combination of deepwater supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) drilling, CO2 capture and storage is developed as an important measure to achieve carbon neutrality target for deepwtaer drilling platform. Other physical adsorption separation and storage concepts for CO2 emissions based on drilling riser is projected. The prospective and fundamental study on carbon neutrality deepwater drilling platform is of great reference and value for deepwater drilling engineering development in the background of global effort for carbon neutrality.

TI  - Numerical simulations of spreading and dissipation of a supercritical CO2 Plume
AB  - CO2 sequestration (capture, separation, and long term storage) in various geologic media including depleted oil reservoirs, saline aquifers, and oceanic sediments is being considered as a possible solution to reduce green house gas emissions. Dissolution of supercritical CO2 in formation brines is considered an important storage mechanism to prevent possible leakage. Accurate prediction of the plume dissolution rate and migration is essential. Analytical analysis and numerical experiments have demonstrated that convective (Rayleigh) instability has a crucial effect on the rate of dissipation of the CO2 plume. Global stability analysis indicates that a minimum grid resolution is needed to capture the features of density-driven fingering phenomena. For 3-D field scale simulations, high resolution leads to large numbers of grid nodes, unfeasible for a single workstation. In this study, we investigate the effects of convective instability on geologic sequestration of CO2 by taking advantage of parallel computing using the code PFLOTRAN, a massively parallel 3-D reservoir simulator for modeling subsurface multiphase, multicomponent reactive flow and transport based on continuum scale mass and energy conservation equations. The onset, development and long-term fate of a supercritical CO2 plume is investigated with high resolution numerical simulations to determine the rate of plume dissolution caused by fingering phenomena. It is found that the vertical grid spacing Î”z controls the plume extent, whereas the horizontal spacing Î”x, Î”y, affects the rate of dissipation of the plume.

TI  - Extension of CO2 storage life in the Sleipner CCS project by reservoir pressure management
AB  - In this study, we performed reservoir simulations to investigate CO2 storage in the saline aquifer in Sleipner by reservoir pressure management. Results show that by producing water at the lowest aquifer structure far away from the CO2-water contact in the vertical direction, an additional 73% (24 Mt) CO2 can be stored compared to the case without water production. This extra CO2 stored can generate a revenue of $800 millions at the prevailing carbon tax of $69 per ton in Norway. There is 5.31 Mtpa of natural CO2 production from 124 gas and oil fields in Norway in 2020. Of these, the Marulk, Dvalin, Skarv, Morvin, Ã…sgard, Kristin, Tyrihans and Mikkel fields in the Norwegian Sea, and the KvitebjÃ¸rn, Valemon, Visund, Gudrun fields in the North Sea produce a total of 4.55 Mtpa CO2 potentially supplying CO2 to Sleipner for project life extension.

TI  - Numerical Prediction of the Behavior of CO(2)Bubbles Leaked from Seafloor and Their Convection and Diffusion near Southeastern Coast of Korea
AB  - Among various carbon capture and storage technologies to mitigate global warming and ocean acidification due to greenhouse gases, ocean geological storage is considered the most feasible for Korea due to insufficient inland space to store CO2. However, the risk of CO(2)leakage and the behavior and environmental effects of the leaked CO(2)need to be assessed for its successful implementation. Therefore, the behavior of CO(2)bubbles/droplets dissolving into the surrounding seawater and the diffusion of dissolved CO(2)by ocean flows should be accurately predicted. However, finding corresponding research has been difficult in Korea. Herein, the behavior and convection-diffusion of CO(2)that was assumed to have leaked from the seafloor near the southeastern coast of Korea were numerically predicted using a multi-scale ocean model for the first time. In the simulation region, one of the pilot projects of CO(2)ocean geological storage had started but has been temporarily halted. In the ocean model, hydrostatic approximation and the Eulerian-Lagrangian two-phase model were applied for meso- and small-scale regions, respectively. Parameters for the simulations were the leakage rate and the initial diameter of CO2. Results revealed that all leaked and rising CO(2)bubbles were dissolved into the seawater before reaching the free surface; further, the change in the partial pressure of CO(2)did not exceed 500 ppm during 30 days of leakage for all cases.

TI  - Capturing carbon dioxide: The feasibility of re-using existing pipeline infrastructure to transport anthropogenic Co2
AB  - Climate change has been attributed to green house gases, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being the main contributor. Sixty to seventy percent of carbon dioxide emissions originate from fossil fuel power plants. Power companies in the UK, along with oil and gas field operators, are proposing to capture this anthropogenic CO2 and either store it in depleted reservoirs or saline aquifers (carbon capture and storage, CCS), or use it for 'Enhanced Oil Recovery' (EOR) in depleting oil and gas fields. This would involve extensive onshore and offshore pipeline systems. The decline of oil and gas production of reservoirs beyond economic feasibility will require the decommissioning onshore and offshore facilities post-production. This creates a possible opportunity for using existing pipeline infrastructure. Conversions of pipelines from natural gas service to CO2 service for EOR have been done in the United States. However, the differing sources of CO2 and the differing requirements for EOR and CCS play a significant part in allowing the re-use of existing infrastructure. The effect of compositions, the phase of transportation, the original pipeline specifications, and also the pipeline route require major studies prior to allowing re-use. This paper will first review the requirements for specifying the purity of the CO2 for CCS and to highlight the implications that the presence of impurities and the current water specifications for pipelines has on the phase diagram and the associated physical properties of the CO2 stream. A 'best' and 'worst' case impurity specification will be identified. Then an analysis on the impact and subsequent validation, of equations of state based on available experimental data on the phase modelling of anthropogenic CO2 is presented. A case study involving an existing 300km gas pipeline in the National Transmission System (NTS) in the UK is then modelled, to demonstrate the feasibility of using this pipeline to transport anthropogenic CO2. The various issues involved for the selected 'best' and 'worst' case specification are also covered. This is then followed by an investigation of the options for transport in the 'gas' phase and 'supercritical' phases, and also identifying the limitations on re-using pipeline infrastructure for CCS.

TI  - Retrofitting CO2 capture ready fossil plants with post-combustion capture. Part 2: Requirements for natural gas combined cycle plants using solvent-based flue gas scrubbing
AB  - A number of natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power stations recently permitted in the UK have been required to be CO2 capture ready so that carbon capture and storage can be retrofitted once it is commercially viable (or legally required). Several options for future CO2 capture from NGCC units can be envisaged including post-combustion capture technology using flue gas scrubbing with aqueous solvents. When an NGCC plant is designed to be ready for a retrofit with post-combustion capture, one of the most important technical considerations is the steam extraction pressure and flow to provide the energy necessary for solvent regeneration. This is determined by the choice of solvent used, but new solvents are being developed and the exact future requirements, in perhaps 10-20 years time, cannot be predicted. Ways in which designs for the steam cycle of NGCC plants can cope with this challenge are presented. Several alternatives to mitigate the loss of power output of NGCC plants retrofitted with post-combustion capture and to achieve improved plant flexibility are also assessed and compared.

TI  - We need facts not nationalistic sentiment or party politics
AB  - Two generations of ministers have misrepresented the evidence for new nuclear power stations, basing their arguments on an assumption in favor of nuclear rather than examining the facts first. The scientific, environmental and political communities are all divided over what the future energy mix should look like, and how much faith one should place in gas, nuclear and renewables respectively. There is potential for the UK to lead the world in carbon capture and storage and in marine generation, but these technologies are at too early a stage to compete with wind and nuclear for the medium-term plans. It seems whatever the government, industry or agriculture wants to do these days there is an immediate, vociferous, often violent reaction in the form of anti-everything rent-a-mobs, to the point that we will stagnate unless some hard decisions are taken.

TI  - Challenges to the pipeline transportation of dense CO2
AB  - OVER THE past decade, the prospect of climate change resulting from anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere has become a matter of growing political and public concern. To achieve the global goals of reduction in CO2 emissions, carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been introduced as one of the most promising methods. One of the initiatives in this direction is the Norwegian government's decision to capture CO2 at the KÃ¥rstÃ¸ gas power plant for permanent storage in a subsea aquifer in the North Sea. While both the capture and the storage issues have got considerable attention in the debate of how to realize CCS, the transportation has been regarded as fairly trivial. There are, however, several important technical issues to be resolved related to pipeline transport of dense CO2, and some of these are highlighted in DNV's report to the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) as input to their feasibility study of the KarstÃ¸ CCS concept. Such issues are limitation of gas humidity to avoid corrosion of C-Mn steel pipes, severity of accidental entrance of wet gas, toughness requirements to ensure fracture arrest properties under a release of dense CO2, corrosivity of reproduced CO2 from enhanced oil recovery (EOR) reservoirs, and procedures for requalification of oil and gas pipelines for transport of dense CO2.

TI  - Case study on CO2 transport pipeline network design for Humber region in the UK
AB  - Reliable, safe and economic CO2 transport from CO2 capture points to long-term storage/enhanced oil recovery sites is critical for commercial deployment of carbon capture and storage technology. Pipeline transportation of CO2 is considered the most feasible and viable option for achieving this. However, in carbon capture and storage applications, there is concern about associated impurities and huge volumes of high pressure CO2 to be transported over distances that will likely be densely populated areas. On this basis, there is limited experience for design and economic assessment of CO2 pipeline. The Humber region in the UK is a likely site for building CO2 pipelines in the future due to large CO2 emissions in the region and its close access to depleted gas fields and saline aquifers beneath the North Sea. In this paper, various issues to be considered in CO2 pipeline design for carbon capture and storage applications are discussed. Also, different techno-economic correlations for CO2 pipelines are assessed using the Humber region as a case study. Levelized cost of CO2 pipelines calculated for the region range from 0.14 to 0.75 GBP per tonne of CO2. This is a preliminary study and is useful for obtaining quick techno-economic assessment of CO 2 pipelines. Â© IMechE 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.

TI  - CO2-brine surface dissolution and injection: CO2 storage enhancement
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is capable of reducing atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gases from coal or gas fired power plants. The upward buoyancy of dense phase carbon dioxide (CO2) in deep reservoirs means that sites need to be chosen with a methodology which has carefully evaluated details of performance during and after the injection process. Standard methods of site evaluation for saline aquifers focus overwhelmingly on the aspects of geological containment and monitorability. Also important to storage site performance is the engineering design of transport and injection. Transport to storage in offshore saline aquifers is normally expected to be by pipeline. There are several proposed methods of CO2 injection, for example as a dense phase, in the liquid or supercritical phase, as water-alternating gas cycles, or as carbonated brine. These result in different migration pathways in the aquifer during the short term (1-50yr) and storage distributions in the long term (1,000 - 10,000 yr). To develop a methodology suitable for making informed decisions for aquifers offshore of the UK, several of these different methods are being evaluated. A chemical engineering and reservoir engineering approach will be used to define some of the important surface transport and subsurface interactions. Important surface features may include the energy balance, location, sizing, materials specification and costing of surface equipment for mixing and transporting CO2.

TI  - Assessment of CO2 storage in DFl-1 South China sea gas field for CCS demonstration
AB  - The DFl-1 gas field is located in the west of the South China Sea, which is associated with a high concentration of CO2. Currently CO 2 separated from a natural gas stream is disposed in a way that doesn't consider environmental effects. In this study, a demonstrative project of a CO2 capture and storage (CCS) technique is considered, proposing to inject CO2 separated on the platform back into the original gas reservoir. The CO2 storage site considered is a nearly abandoned gas block in the DFl-I gas field, which was reassessed for the safety of CO 2 storage. A membrane separation technique will be used on the platform for the separation. CO2 is compressed at supercritical state and injected through a single well (that used to be a producer) into the gas formation. A new platform auxiliary to the main platform will be built to accommodate the compressor and separation equipment. CO2 will be injected at the rate of 0.14Ã—106 Sm3/d for 10 years over the field development period. At the end of the project, the pressure of the CO2 storage reservoir will be increased to its original pressure. Scoping economic analysis shows that the CO2 storage cost of the project is approximately USD 20 per ton CO2, in which the auxiliary platform is the main cost factor.

TI  - Application of a dual tubing CO2 injection-water production horizontal well pattern for improving the CO2 storage capacity and reducing the CAPEX: A case study in Pohang basin, Korea
AB  - Water production is an efficient way of relieving pressure build-up and improving the CO2 storage capacity (CSC) in the carbon capture and storage process. The additional offshore platforms, production wells, pipelines, and pumps required for water production, however, increase the capital expenditure (CAPEX) of the project. Therefore, a CO2 injection method that can both improve the CSC and reduce the CAPEX is needed. This paper proposes a dual-tubing CO2 injection-water production horizontal well (DTHW) pattern for improving the CSC, in which CO2 is injected at the heel of the horizontal well while water is produced at the toe. The CSC and CAPEX of the proposed DTHW pattern were then compared to those of other cases in a saline aquifer in the Pohang basin, offshore Korea. The CCSPerformance (CSC to CAPEX ratio) of the proposed DTHW pattern was larger than that of a typical CO2 injection with a water production pattern for the all CO2 injection-water production rate cases. The proposed DTHW pattern showed promising results in that the maximum CSC was improved by 98.2\% compared to a single vertical CO2 injection well pattern and the CAPEX was reduced by 37.1\% compared to the typical CO2 injection with a water production pattern. More CAPEX might be saved if a DTHW pattern is used in an onshore platform near a power plant because an additional offshore platform and pipeline are not required.

TI  - Qualification of polymer materials for high pressure CO2 flexible pipe structures
AB  - In the oil and gas industry there is a growing demand for riser solutions dedicated to high partial pressures of CO2. The demand is primarily driven by deep water high pressure reservoirs with high CO2 content. In addition there is a growing interest in reinjection of CO2. The reinjection can be driven by a desire to reduce CO2 emission as in Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects, but also as a method for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). In all cases it is likely that CO2 will be present at high pressures and in its supercritical phase. NOV Flexibles has in recent years developed dedicated riser solutions for a broad range of flexible pipe applications for use with high pressure dense phase CO2 also referred to as supercritical CO2 (SCCO2). An important part of the qualification program has been material qualification. For polymeric materials, the main challenge is the high solubility in some polymers of high pressure CO2. This leads to potential high swelling and a risk of mechanical damage (blistering) in explosive decompression situations. Furthermore, high pressure CO2 has a strong extraction power which may result in rapid loss of plasticizer in plasticized polymers. This paper describes the latest status and achievements in the qualification program including a broad variety of tests qualifying against potential failure mechanisms to CO2 pressures in the range of 650 to 700 bar. The results show that peroxide cross-linked poly-ethylene (XLPE) in-line cured inner liner with a high degree of cross linking has superior resistance to high pressure CO2 on all tested parameters compared to other available liner materials. This makes it the preferred liner material for ultra high pressure CO2 gas risers and flowlines whereas PVDF is the optimum choice for production risers with temperatures above 90Â°C and intermediate CO2 partial pressures.

TI  - Evaluating the Performance of a Newly Developed Carbon Capture Device for Mobile Emission Sources
AB  - In the present study, a new carbon capture device that can be carried on-board vehicles has been developed and tested. The developed device uses absorption and adsorption methods of postcombustion CO2 capture. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) pellets and calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2 have been used as solvents and sorbents in the device. The CO2 capture efficiency has been evaluated at a wide range of operating conditions. The results showed that the higher the concentration of the solvent, the higher the capture efficiency, i.e., w 100% capture efficiency, being obtained at full saturation of NaOH. In addition, the increase in the solution temperature increases the capture efficiency up to 50Â°C. Design of the gas distributer in the device has also a notable effect on CO2 capture. It was found that solvent prepared with seawater can provide high capture efficiency over a wide range of operation, but in general, it has a lower capture efficiency than that prepared by tap water. Moreover, solvents prepared by NaOH have a superior CO2 capture efficiency over those prepared by Ca(OH)2. For the adsorption technique, a 50% NaOH and 50% Ca(OH) mixture by mass has provided the highest capture efficiency compared with each sorbent when used alone. Copyright Â© 2017 by ASME.

TI  - Operational Flexibility of Future Generation Portfolios Using High Spatial- and Temporal-Resolution Wind Data
AB  - Increasing amounts of variable renewable energy sources will cause fundamental and structural changes to thermal power plant operating regimes. Maintaining key reserve requirements will lead to an increase in power plant start-ups and cycling operations for some units. An enhanced unit commitment model with energy storage and flexible CO2 capture is formulated. High-resolution on-/offshore wind data for the U.K., and probabilistic wind power forecast, model wind imbalances at operational timescales. The strategic use of flexible CO2 capture and energy storage helps maintain reserve levels, decreasing power plant cycling operations and wind curtailment. A temporally explicit variability assessment of net demand illustrates the generation flexibility requirements and the nonlinear impacts of increasing wind capacity on power plant operating regimes.

TI  - Comparative Life Cycle Assessment of tidal stream turbine blades
AB  - Renewable energy allows electricity generation with lower environmental and resource impact than generation from fossil fuels. However, the manufacture, use and ultimate disposal of the equipment used to capture this energy has an environmental impact, which should be minimised. Tidal turbine blades are currently primarily manufactured from glass-fibre reinforced polymers. Such blades cannot be recycled at the end of their life, and are disposed of in landfill or by incineration. As the tidal energy industry grows, the volume of non-recyclable waste is a potential problem. Here we consider the environmental impact of ten combinations of material and disposal method for tidal stream turbine blades, including recyclable options. Our findings suggest that glass fibre blades have greenhouse gas emissions of around 15,500 kgCO2e for the scope considered, and a significant environmental impact in all impact categories, which would be increased by changing to carbon fibre (99% mean increase from glass fibre across impact categories) or steel (134% mean increase from glass fibre across impact categories) blades, but that composite materials using flax fibre and recyclable resin may have lower impact (26% mean decrease from glass fibre across impact categories), provided they are treated correctly after use. These materials may also offer the potential for lower cost blades in future. Â© 2022, European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference. All rights reserved.

TI  - CO2 ocean sequestration by moving ships
AB  - Ocean sequestration of the CO2 captured from fossil-fuel burning is a possible option to mitigate the increase in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. It can isolate huge amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere for a long time at relatively low cost, if it is acceptable from the viewpoint of the environmental impact on the ocean. The concept of CO2 dispersion in the ocean depths by ships is a promising method for efficient dilution. That is, liquefied CO2 is delivered to the site and injected into the ocean at depths of 1000-2500m with a suspended pipe towed by a slowly moving ship. In addition to the horizontal movement of the release point, the vertical journey of CO2 droplets until they disappear by dissolution is effective for the dilution of CO2 in seawater. In this paper, the possibility of the generation of relatively large-sized droplets from a moving nozzle is investigated experimentally. In addition, the terminal velocity of CO2 droplets in deep-sea circumstances is measured in a large high-pressure tank to investigate the influence of the hydrate film formed on the surface of the droplet. Finally, it is shown by simulation that an initial dilution ratio of one to some ten thousandths is possible on a realistic engineering scale in the moving ship type of CO2 ocean sequestration.

TI  - International legal and regulatory developments for carbon dioxide capture and storage: From the London Convention to the Clean Development Mechanism
AB  - Several major international legal and regulatory instruments have seriously considered carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS). This article describes the processes they underwent to consider CCS and produce 'evidence-based policy-change' on CCS, drawing upon scientific, technical, and engineering evidence from CCS, geological, and environmental sciences. The specific examples used will be the London Convention, OSPAR, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, and the Clean Development Mechanism. In particular, the work undertaken within the London Convention and OSPAR has provided the world with useful risk assessment and management guidelines for CCS, with wider applicability than those conventions. Lessons can be learnt from these instruments for the development of regulatory frameworks for CCS. Â© 2009 IMechE.

TI  - CO2 transportation
AB  - Carbon dioxide transportation from the capture point to the utilization or storage point plays a key function in carbon capture and storage systems. CO2 transportation modes (onshore pipelines, offshore pipelines, and ships) are introduced in this chapter. The design specifications, construction procedures, cost estimation, safety regulations, environmental and risk aspects, energy requirement, international codes and standards, legal issues, and international conventions of these modes are presented and discussed. Furthermore, the challenges and future research directions associated with CO2 transportation are concluded. The large capital and operational costs, integrity, flow assurance, and safety issues are the greatest challenges of CO2 pipeline transports. Substantial efforts must be directed to reduce these costs by improving less energy-intensive configurations. A holistic assessment of the impacts of CO2 impurities on the corrosion rate and the phase change of the transported stream is required to improve pipeline integrity. The influence of impurities and the changes in elevation on the pressure drop along the pipeline needs to be further investigated to ensure continuous flow via accurate positioning of the pumping stations. Although the long experience in the oil and gas pipeline industry forms a powerful reference, it is necessary to develop particular standards and techno-economic frameworks to mitigate the barriers facing CO2 transportation technologies.

TI  - Effect of common impurities on the phase behaviour of carbon dioxide rich systems: Minimizing the risk of hydrate formation and two-phase flow
AB  - CO2 produced by carbon capture processes is generally not pure and can contain impurities such as N2, H2, CO, H 2S and water. The presence of these impurities could lead to challenging flow assurance issues. The presence of water may result in ice and/or gas hydrate formation and cause blockage. Reducing the water content is commonly required to reduce the potential for corrosion but for an offshore pipeline system it is also used as a means of preventing gas hydrate problems; however, there is little information on the dehydration requirements. Furthermore, the gaseous CO2 rich stream is generally compressed to be transported as liquid or dense-phase in order to avoid two-phase flow and increase the density of the system. The presence of the above impurities will also change the system's bubble point pressure, hence affecting the compression requirement. The aim of this communication is to evaluate the risk of hydrate formation in a rich carbon dioxide stream and to study the phase behaviour of CO2 in the presence of common impurities. An experimental methodology was developed for measuring water content in CO2 rich phase in equilibrium with hydrates. The water content in equilibrium with hydrates at simulated pipeline conditions (e.g., 4 Â°C up to 190 bar) as well as after simulated choke conditions (e.g., at -2 Â°C and around 50 bar) were measured for pure CO2 and a mixture of 2 mole% H2 and 98 mole% CO2. Bubble point measurements were also carried out for this binary mixture for temperatures ranging from -20 Â°C to 25 Â°C. A thermodynamic approach was employed to model the phase equilibria. The experimental data available in the literature on gas solubility in water in binary systems were used in tuning the BIPs. The thermodynamic model was used to predict the phase behaviour and the hydrate dissociation conditions of various CO2 rich streams in the presence of free water and various levels of dehydration (250 ppm and 500 ppm). The results are in good agreement with the available experimental data. The developed experimental methodology and thermodynamic model could provide the necessary data in determining the required dehydration level for CO2 rich systems, as well as minimum pipeline pressure required to avoid two phase flow, hydrates, and water condensation.

TI  - Carbon cop-out: Critics say that the chancellor's carbon initiatives fail to address key growth areas
AB  - Alistair Darling is planning to implement the 'world's first carbon budget', which fails to address the key issues associated with green-environment according to critics. The chancellor has announced a Â£1.4 billion environmental package to support high-technology industries in areas like offshore wind, carbon capture and storage (CSS), energy efficiency, and advanced manufacturing. Some environmental agencies say that the budget has failed to focus on the environmental industries as a key growth area. The Environmental Industries Commission (EIC) has introduced its 'Green Jobs Investment Fund', which includes retrofit of particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) abatement technologies in the UK's transport fleet. EIC is supporting the government's strategies to move away from traditional manufacturing sectors and towards high-growth green industries.

TI  - Preventing Over-Electrodialysis for Efficient CO2 Capture from Seawater
AB  - Most CO2 extraction techniques involve thermal cycles where CO2 is captured from a gas stream by a nucleophilic agent in a solvent and is extracted by heating the solvent. Such processes are energy-intensive and require a large solvent makeup at the end of each cycle. Electrodialysis (ED) of seawater is an efficient method to capture CO2 as the seawater is already equilibrated with CO2 in the air, which avoids processing large volumes of air that is otherwise necessary for other direct air capture techniques. The efficient capture of CO2 via ED requires selective removal of HCO3- and CO32- from seawater. However, the ED membranes generally are not selective to specific anions. Consequently, during the ED of seawater, HCO3/CO32- are removed along with other anions such as Cl-, SO42-, and so on, causing over-dialysis of seawater. ED systems can be energy-intensive when over-electrodialysis causes preferential rejection of salt anions over CO2-capturing anions (i.e., HCO3- and CO32-) leading to excessive energy penalties. Here we evaluate the effect of dominant anions such as Cl- and SO42- on CO2 capture during ED. We observe this influence by monitoring the transference number of HCO3-, Cl-, and SO42- in the seawater at various concentrations. Interestingly, at lower concentrations of HCO3-, the CO2 capture rate reaches a maximum of similar to 1.22 mmol/m(2)/s and then ultimately diminishes indicating complete exhaustion of HCO3-. Beyond this point, the electrodialysis system only works toward rejecting other salt anions. Using the optimal residence time, CO2 is preferentially captured at 0.71 mmol/ m(2)/s continuously using simulated seawater. This work shows a systematic study to prevent over-electrodialysis and efficiently capture CO2. The insights from the influence of anions on CO2 capture can be a stepping stone to the large-scale implementation of such a process.

TI  - Optimization of CCUS supply chains in the UK: A strategic role for emissions reduction
AB  - The UK is the second largest emitter of carbon dioxide in Europe. It aims to take urgent actions to achieve the 2030 target for CO2 emissions reduction imposed by EU environmental policies. Three different carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) supply chains are developed giving economic indicators for CO2 utilization routes not implying carbon dioxide hydrogenation (i.e. with high TRL). The study presents an innovative proposal to reduce CO2 impact in the UK, a country rich in coal, which requires reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from flue gases as the easiest and best performing solution. Bunter Sandstone, Scottish offshore and Ormskirk Sandstone are the storage sites considered, while several attractive potential utilization options are considered. Through minimization of total costs, the CCUS supply chain with Bunter Sandstone as storage site results in the most economically profitable solution due to the highest value of net present value (â‚¬ 0.554 trillion) and lowest value of pay back period (2.85 years). Only carbon tax is considered. The total cost is â‚¬ 1.04 billion/year. Across the supply chain, 6.4 Mton/year of carbon dioxide emissions are avoided, to be either stored or used for calcium carbonate production. Future work should consider uncertainty, dynamics of market demand and social aspects. Â© 2020

TI  - Fluid dynamics numerical assessment to evaluate the ice formation around the pipeline
AB  - In response to the UNCCC held in Paris in 2015 the need to reduce the global warming, due to CO2 release in atmosphere, led to a new business for the capture and storage of CO2 in dedicated deep water reservoir. In this sense the transport of the CO2 at low temperature, necessary to condensate the gas, through offshore pipeline is a commercial and technical valid strategy. One of the issues related to the transport of a condensate gas is the thermal exchange between the transport system, in this case offshore pipelines, and the environment. The gas is usually carried by ships in a liquid phase at very low temperatures, for example -30 Â°C in case of CO2. The fluid is introduced into the pipeline at the same temperature to not further consume energy for warming up. The design of the offshore pipeline subject to these operating conditions, very cold fluid internally and a water temperature slightly over 0Â°C at external side, can be affected by the ice formation around the pipe. The ice thickness formation is primarily governed by the external convection coefficient. For the offshore pipelines located in deep waters where the sea currents are negligible, only the natural convection phenomena can occur on the external surface of the pipeline. Considering steady state scenario the heat transfer from the internal fluid to the external environmental is governed by the thermal resistance of each component of the system like fluid, steel, anticorrosion coating, thermal insulation if any and external convection due to the seawater. The low temperatures of both seawater and ice formation, approximately at -2Â°C, allow to be close to the maximum value of the seawater density: usually this occurs at a slightly colder temperatures depending on salinity and water depth (for the fresh water the maximum is at 4Â°C). The natural convection is driven by the buoyancy effect due to fluid density variation with temperature: the scenario described above lead to minimizes these effects and consequently the heat transfer due to the natural convection (increasing the thermal resistance). Most of the correlations in literature are related to different temperature ranges, far away from this particular situation: a numerical investigation using computational fluid dynamics technique has been performed. The analysis is executed by means of commercial CFD software FLUENT: the model is based on a two dimensional grid of a pipe submerged in water. In this paper: The state-of-the-art about the natural convection coefficient estimate for submerged cylinders proposed by different authors through Nusselt number assessment; A description of the proposed numerical approach is given highlighting the different approaches based on the boundary layer behavior; A typical application is shown.

TI  - Experiments on methane hydrates formation in seabed deposits and gas recovery adopting carbon dioxide replacement strategies
AB  - Topic of this work is to carry out studies to deepen the knowledge of the CO2-CH4 replacement process, using a laboratory scale apparatus designed to reproduce marine hydrate sediments. Nine tests were performed, at three different hydrate saturation levels: 10, 20 and 30\%. Temperature profiles over time allow to determine the spatial distribution of the formed hydrates in the sediment. At 10\% and 20\% hydrates saturation the reaction always starts in the upper part of the reactor, but the massive formation occurred in the lower and the middle area. When saturation reached 30\%, reaction heat was mainly produced in the upper part of the reactor. Three CO2-CH4 replacement tests were carried out at 10\% hydrate saturation. During the tests both temperature and pressure were modified to cause the CH4 hydrates dissociation and the CO2 hydrates formation. At the end of the replacement process, CO2 stored was in the range 31-42\% of the total CO2 injected, and the exchange efficiency was in the range 1.30-1.45.

TI  - Global carbon dioxide recycling - Corrosion prevention: The key to the use of renewable energy
AB  - Extrapolation of world energy consumption between 1990 and 2006 to the future reveals the complete exhaustion of petroleum, natural gas, coal and uranium reserves on the Earth in 2037, 2042, 2055 and 2057, respectively. We are proposing global carbon dioxide recycling to use renewable energy by which all people in the whole world can survive. The electricity will be generated by solar cell in the deserts and used for production of hydrogen by seawater electrolysis at the nearby desert coasts. Hydrogen, for which no infrastructures of transportation and combustion exist, will be converted to methane at the desert coasts by the reaction with carbon dioxide captured by energy consumers. Among systems in global carbon dioxide recycling, seawater electrolysis and carbon dioxide methanation have not been performed industrially. We created energy-saving cathodes for hydrogen production and anodes for oxygen evolution without chlorine formation in seawater electrolysis, and ideal catalysts for methane formation by the reaction of carbon dioxide with hydrogen. The key factors for realization of global carbon dioxide recycling are the activity enhancement and corrosion prevention of those key materials.

TI  - A long-term strategic plan of offshore CO2 transport and storage in northern South China Sea for a low-carbon development in Guangdong province, China
AB  - Strategic regional planning is an important step towards a successful CCUS development. This paper is the first effort of proposing a development plan of offshore CO2 storage and transport for Guangdong in 2030 and 2050. We attempt to make an ambitious and achievable plan. The cluster-hub model of sources and sinks is adopted, and reuse of existing infrastructures is preferred. The targets of CCUS in Guangdong by 2050 are approximately 8\% of the CCS targets that proposed for entire China (ADB, 2015), except a smaller target of 2050. The dual-phase and dual-track approach of ADB's roadmap is followed. The CCUS phase I before 2030 is characterized by the capture of high-purity CO2 from petrochemical industry and the storage of CO2 mainly related to CO2-EOR. The target of similar to 3 Mtpa CCUS in 2030 will be achieved by source-sink match A1. The phase II from 2030 to 2050 is characterized by a wider deployment of CCUS. The target of CCUS in Guangdong is similar to 35 Mtpa in 2040 and similar to 110 Mtpa in 2050, leading to the cumulative CO2 avoidance of similar to 187 MtCO(2) for 2031-2040 and similar to 730 MtCO(2) for 2041-2050. Four source-sink matches are proposed for this phase, including the storage clusters in the Pearl River Mouth Basin and in the Beibuwan Basin in the northern South China Sea. Research with sufficient lead time to support the phased CCUS development is proposed, including databases, feasibility studies, technique R\&D, cost estimation, and optimized system design. We are fully aware of the large uncertainty in the years ahead, and regard this planning as a highly general and hypothetic proposal.

TI  - Screening of conventional ionic liquids for carbon dioxide capture and separation
AB  - CO2 capture and storage could efficiently mitigate CO2 emissions, wherein CO2 capture is a crucial energy-intensive process. Ionic liquids (ILs) have been proposed as potential liquid absorbents for CO2 separation. The CO2 absorption capacity and selectivity of ILs have also been investigated extensively. Although ILs have been screened for CO2 separation, only specific ILs have been examined in terms of energy consumption. In this study, 76 conventional ILs were collected and screened in terms of energy consumption to establish potential ILs for CO2 separation. Seventeen ILs were screened according to the CO2 dissolution enthalpy and CO2 working capacity criteria obtained from the Henry's law constant in the preliminary screening. Seven ILs were then screened from the 17 ILs according to the CO2 working capacity from the measured CO2 solubility in the final screening. The energy consumptions of the seven screened ILs (i.e., {[}Emim]{[}NTf2], {[}Bmim]{[}BF4], [}Bmim]{[}PF6], {[}Bmim]{[}NTf2], {[}Bmim]{[}NTf2], {[}Bmpy]{[}NTf2], and {[}Hmpy]{[}NTf2]) were calculated, and the corresponding gas solubility selectivities were discussed. The energy consumptions and properties of the seven screened ILs were compared with those of the commercial CO2 absorbents of 30 wt\% MEA, 30 wt\% MDEA, and dimethyl ethers of polyethylene glycol (Selexol (TM) or Coastal AGR (R)). The results showed that the energy consumptions of the seven screened ILs were lower than those of the commercial CO2 absorbents. {[}Hmpy]{[}NTf2] showed the lowest energy consumption among the seven screened ILs under the operating conditions set in this study.

TI  - Carbon capture for enhanced oil recovery in Niger delta: A case study of Okota/Okpoputa field in offshore Niger delta
AB  - Carbon capture for enhanced oil recovery is a proven technology that holds the promise of increasing oil reserves, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, diminish the concerns associated with the release of cocktail gases from gas flaring and reduce hostility in host communities. In this work, we considered the Okota/Okpoputa field in Offshore Niger Delta and covered areas of interest such as the post combustion capture using monoethanolamine (MEA), prognosis of storage site, increase production pressure, economics of the capture and assessment of the risk of leakage. With about 80million tonnes of CO2 captured annually from flared flue gas, the CO2-enhanced oil recovery will yield 20-40% Original Oil in Place (OOIIP), and this will translate to a savings of $ 474,500,000 excluding commercial sales of CO2.

TI  - UK: Carbon Source: Call for UK carbon abatement strategy
AB  - With the offshore industry likely to be at the heart of a future UK carbon capture and storage (CCS) strategy, the key issues and the steps that can be taken to begin analyzing the potential for CCS are presented. There is more and more evidence that offshore storage of CO2 will be the most viable solution for CCS. More technical analysis recently has reinforced the case for looking very seriously at the North Sea as a major storage ground for CO2. A lot of work is being conducted regarding reservoir integrity - examining whether old oil and gas fields have the necessary geological characteristics for CO2 storage on a large scale. Then industry has had a cautious attitude towards major EOR spending, even with rising prices. So far, carbon storage is considered to be incidental to the main EOR objective of extracting more core product. CO2 injection is just one of the techniques for EOR, and not always the most economical or technically superior.

TI  - Topside process design for the liquid CO2 Injection
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one of the dominant technologies to tackle the global warming issue. The transport of CO2 for geological storage is economically feasible by ship when the storage site location is off-shore and instalment of an off-shore pipeline requires a huge capital cost. Ship transportation requires the captured CO2 to be in liquid phase under pressurized thermodynamic conditions. The injection of liquid CO2 into the geological reservoir involves pressurization and heating in order to maintain the safe well head operating conditions. This study presents two alternative top side injection process designs that can reduce the power requirement compared to the base case design. The base case design and alternative designs are simulated using Aspen HYSYS (R) in order to decide the process design variables. The study employed two-stage rankine cycle in order to extract the cold energy available from the liquid CO2 before its injection into the reservoir. The alternative designs also proposed to utilize a vapor return line in order to maintain the vessel pressure within safe limits by performing a dynamic simulation. Finally, a sensitivity analysis has been done in order to investigate the effect of some important variables in the study.

TI  - GEOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE HYDRAULICALLY-CONNECTED BUNTER SANDSTONE FORMATION SALINE AQUIFER IN THE SOUTHERN NORTH SEA
AB  - The Bunter Sandstone Formation in the Southern North Sea is an important potential CO2 storage reservoir and is likely to form an integral part of the UK's carbon capture and storage ambition for industrial clusters in northeast England. In this study, a geological model is developed for the Bunter Sandstone Connected Aquifer in the Southern North Sea. This region is structurally-bound by large faults and salt features that are thought to compartmentalise it from surrounding Bunter Sandstone aquifer(s). Notable features of the Bunter Sandstone Connected Aquifer include a seismic polarity reversal in the top Bunter Sandstone horizon, and the 'seabed outcrop', a location at which the Bunter Sandstone subcrops a thin Quaternary sequence. Several storage sites have been identified within the Bunter Sandstone Connected Aquifer, and this model will provide an opportunity to assess regional pressurization, geomechanical modelling and estimates of CO2 storage capacity in the context of injection at multiple locations.

TI  - Leaching tests as useful tools to characterised contaminated marine sediments mobility under CO 2 leakages from CCS technology
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been gaining attention as a climate change mitigation option. However, the potential impact of possible CO 2 leakages on the marine sediments and the sea environment is an important consideration for the application of these techniques. The analysis, modeling, and assessment of the mobility of substances from sediments in contact with acidified seawater by CO 2 leakages could be done by leaching tests. The effect of different type of water, i.e., deionized water, seawater, and acidified seawater, on leaching data was studied. The pollutant release was evaluated as a function of pH. The release in batch and column tests were compared as a function of liquid-solid ratio. The mechanisms of the leaching tests were elucidated. This is an abstract of a paper presented at the 7th European Congress of Chemical Engineering-7 and 19th International Congress of Chemical and Process Engineering CHISA 2010 (Prague, Czech Republic 8/28/2010-9/1/2010).

TI  - Identification and characterization of geological formations with co2 storage potential in portugal
AB  - Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) is considered a major part of the Portuguese strategy for reducing CO2 emissions. Some industrial sectors, the most prominent being the cement sector, require the implementation of CO2 storage to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. This paper presents and characterizes the areas with potential for CO2 storage in mainland Portugal. The lithostratigraphic and tectonic frameworks of the onshore and offshore basins are presented; a site screening process was conducted, based on basin-and regional-scale assessments, resulting in the definition of eight possible storage clusters, seven of which are offshore. The storage capacity was estimated for those clusters, with a central (P50) value of 7.09 Gt; however, the most interesting locations are in the Lusitanian Basin (West Iberian Margin), both onshore and offshore, as they present high capacity and are located favourably in relation to the industrial CO2 emitters. Considering only the potential sites of this basin, their storage capacities are greater than 3 Gt CO2, of which 260 Mt are onshore. Â© 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - A study on competitiveness and GHG mitigation effect of IGCC and carbon capture technology through carbon tax change
AB  - As the Kyoto Protocol ratified in Feb. 16 2005, the developed countries, which is involved in Annex-1 of Kyoto Protocol, have tried to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) to the reduction target. To accomplish this target, EU developed a few systems such as Emission hade system, CDM project. Korea has felt pressure to be an Annex-1 nation, because only Korea and Mexico are the non-Annex-1 nation from the OECD nations. In this study, a numerical simulation of a power plant expansion plan was conducted to calculate CO2 emission. The CO2 emission was analyzed with various carbon tax. Especially, we focused on the competitiveness of IGCC and Carbon Capture technology through carbon tax change. In our result, Even though carbon tax rises, nuclear power plant construction does not always increase, it increases until base load. LNG combined cycle power plant substitute the coal fired power plant. If there are many alternatives like IGCC, these substitute a coal fired power plant and we can save CO2 mitigation cost.

TI  - Using flue gas to mitigate ocean acidification
AB  - Researchers from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's (LLNL) Carbon Management Program and the University of California, Santa Cruz found that seawater and calcium could effectively remove most of the CO2 from a natural gas power plant's flue gas stream. A large fraction of the captured gas could then be converted into dissolved calcium bicarbonate - which, pumped into the sea, could be beneficial to the ocean's marine life. The results mean that above-ground CO2 hydration and mineral carbonate scrubbing may provide a "relatively simple" point-source CO2 capture and storage system at coastal locations. According to Greg Rau, a senior scientist with the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz who also works at LLNL, such low-tech CO2 mitigation could be especially relevant for retrofitting to existing power plants and for deployment in the developing world, the primary source of future CO2 emissions.

TI  - Carbon Dioxide Capture by Deep Eutectic Solvent Impregnated Sea Mango Activated Carbon
AB  - The increment amount of the CO2 emission by years has become a major concern worldwide due to the global warming issue. However, the influence modification of activated carbon (AC) has given a huge revolution in CO2 adsorption capture compare to the unmodified AC. In the present study, the Deep Eutectic Solvent (DES) modified surface AC was used for Carbon Dioxide (CO2) capture in the fixed-bed column. The AC underwent pre-carbonization and carbonization processes at 519.8 Â°C, respectively, with flowing of CO2 gas and then followed by impregnation with 53.75% phosphoric acid (H3PO4) at 1:2 precursor-to-activant ratios. The prepared AC known as sea mango activated carbon (SMAC) was impregnated with DES at 1:2 solid-to-liquid ratio. The DES is composing of choline chloride and urea with ratio 1:2 choline chloride to urea. The optimum adsorption capacity of SMAC was 33.46 mgco2/gsol and 39.40 mgco2/gsol for DES modified AC (DESAC). Â© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.

TI  - Exergy analysis of offshore primary petroleum processing plant with CO2 capture
AB  - Primary petroleum processing operations in offshore platforms require significant quantities of energy for extraction, processing and transport. In offshore platforms, these energy requirements are usually provided by locally produced gas, and gas turbines are widely used to generate electricity required for operational activities such as driving pumps and compressors. Releases of gaseous emissions are an integral and inevitable part of the process and CO2-emissions occur mainly from the combustion of gas for power generation and heating purposes. This paper presents the formulation and simulation to evaluate the exergy performance of the processes in an offshore platform considering two configurations: with and without CO2 capture system. Exergy balance formulations have been used to assess the performance of the configurations. Simulations have been developed using Aspen HYSYSÂ®. The exergy consumption required for the petroleum heating in the separation process has a noticeable influence on the whole plant irreversibility. Exergy analysis results are useful to assess and identify processes with potential to improve the plant efficiency and its environmental performance. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A regional CO2 containment assessment of the northern Utsira Formation seal and overburden, northern North Sea
AB  - Upscaling Carbon Capture and Storage requires identification of suitable storage sites, with robust reservoir seals. The Utsira Formation in the northern North Sea has been flagged as a target for further storage. However, there are no regional studies of seal variability addressing heterogeneities that could facilitate seal bypass. This study aims to: (a) identify, assess and map the elements that promote or restrict fluid migration, (b) develop a matrix to regionally map containment confidence (CC) and (c) rank the different areas for CO2 containment across the Utsira Formation. The seal and overburden were mapped using a high-resolution, pre-stack depth-migrated 3D broadband seismic reflection dataset and 141 exploration wells. Seal geometry, sandstone presence and sandstone connectivity in the seal and overburden were assigned relative CC scores, which were summed to map overall CC of the Utsira Fm. Indicators for shallow gas and migration were mapped and correlated with the other elements. Areas with the lowest CC are in the west of the Utsira Fm. Here, sandstones within the Seal Interval are connected through the overburden via sandy submarine fans. In the southeast, dipping stratigraphy downlaps onto the Utsira Fm., increasing the potential for connection with glacially-derived channel-lobe systems in the overburden. The areas with the highest CC are the central and northeast parts of the Utsira Fm., where the Seal Interval is mudstone-dominated and parallel to the reservoir, and channel-lobe systems identified in the Overburden Interval are disconnected from the reservoir. This area coincides with a thick depocentre of the northern Utsira Fm. These results can be used to inform CO2 storage site selection and constrain future CO2 plume simulation analyses for the Utsira Fm. The CC matrix outlined here can also be adapted and applied to regionally assess the containment of other potential CO2 storage reservoirs in any setting.

TI  - Performance assessment of an integrated gasification combined cycle under flexible operation
AB  - In this paper a simulation tool (ThermoflexÂ®) has been setup to model an entire Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) on the basis of the report entitled "Cost and Performance of PC and IGCC Plants for a Range of Carbon dioxide Capture" by DOE/NETL [1]. The investigated layout has no water-gas-shift (WGS) reactor and does not allow for any CO2 capture. Two gasification islands are included, each of which consists of Air Separation Unit (ASU), GEE radiant-only gasifier, quench and syngas scrubber as well as syngas cleanup. Two advanced GE's F-class gas turbines (2x232 MW), coupled with two heat recovery steam generators and one steam turbine (276 MW) constitute the power block. In the IGCC simulation, the base model of the GE 7F.05 gas turbine has been adapted to burn syngas. Mass and energy balances were carefully computed on design condition to validate the proposed modelling procedure against the IGCC performance data contained in the above mentioned report: The net power output of 622 MW was underestimated by about 5% whereas the net electric efficiency was slightly overpredicted. The off-design behavior of the syngas turbine was then simulated as dependent on ambient temperature and partial load, in preparation for modelling flexible operation of the whole power plant. The variation in IGCC net efficiency and power output was assessed in a load following operational strategy, thus reducing the load factor and varying the number and slope of ramps in a typical day. The IGCC net efficiency goes down from 42.5% to 32.8% when the load is reduced from 100% to 40% of the design rate. Â© 2018 ASME.

TI  - HPIn europe: Agency demands CO2 capture at Norway refinery
AB  - Statoil wants to improve energy efficiency at its 10 million ton/yr refinery at Mongstad, near Bergen. A 630-Mw project would supply an electrically powered gas platform in the North Sea while providing heat to the refinery. However, the National Pollution Control Authority is proposing to the Ministry of Environment in Norway that the project capture its CO2 from the very first day of operation. The new combined heat and power plant will emit 1.3 million ton/yr of CO2; integration with the refinery means a net emission of 900,000 ton/yr. A business cycle also needs to be established demonstrating that the CO2 could be used for EOR on the Norwegian continental shelf outside Mongstad.

TI  - FINNCAP - Meri-Pori CCS demonstration project
AB  - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is considered to be a key technology that can help fight climate change. The European Union has pledged significant funds to support the completion of 10-12 large-scale CCS demonstration projects by 2015. Fortum and Teollisuuden Voima (TVO) are developing such a demonstration project at the Meri-Pori power plant. The project would fit especially well with the EU's demonstration programme. The project envisages a capture plant that would treat about 50\% of the 565 MW condensing coal plant's flue gases with a capture rate of over 90\%. It plans to combine CO2 post-combustion capture technology with ship transportation of the CO2 to an offshore storage site abroad, where enhanced oil recovery opportunities would be explored in conjunction with CO2 storage. The project, called FINNCAP, is one of few large-scale CCS projects that will be able to start operations by 2015 in accordance with EU requirements. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A risk-based monitoring plan for the Fort Nelson feasibility project
AB  - The plains CO2 reduction (PCOR) partnership and spectra energy transmission (SET) are investigating the feasibility of a carbon capture and storage (CCS) project near Fort Nelson, British Columbia, Canada. The project aims to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from SET's Fort Nelson sour gas processing plant by injecting up to 2 million tonnes of sour CO2 (approximately 95% CO2, 4% hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and 1% methane (CH4)) a year into a deep mid-Devonian-age carbonate reef for long-term geologic storage. The Fort Nelson CCS project provides a unique opportunity to develop a set of cost-effective, risk-based monitoring techniques for large scale storage of sour CO2 in deep saline formations. An approach is being developed that integrates characterization, modeling, risk assessment, and monitoring into an iterative process to produce superior quality results during each phase of the project. During the pre-injection phase of the project, the characterization activities are used as input to the modeling effort. The results of the modeling and characterization activities are used as input to the first round risk assessment, which helps identify knowledge gaps and project risks. The output from the risk assessment is then used to guide further characterization efforts and develop the monitoring plan. Once injection begins, the monitoring program results will be compared to the modeling predictions.

TI  - Use of Rayleigh Distribution Method for Assessment of Wind Energy Output in Cleveland-Ohio
AB  - The control of carbon emission in the atmosphere is possible only by mitigating the energy sources from fossil fuels to renewable energy resources such as the solar, wind, and tidal energies. These are abundantly available in the nature but the methods to capture and utilize these enormous potential resources are still under investigation due to the limited state of art of infrastructure and low-energy conversion efficiencies. In this work we focused our attention on the potential of the wind energy available around the Lake Erie region using the wind speed data for Cleveland, Ohio, USA. The major challenge in developing a model that generates a uniform output is to have many uncertainties that require deeper studies. In this work, we discussed the available wind energy throughout the year, and the pattern for the wind power output according to a monthly basis was discussed for the last ten years. A statistical method was utilized using the Rayleigh probability distribution function in order to estimate the mean wind speed and calculate the annual energy output from a windmill at the understudied location. An annual energy output of 1286.41 kWh/m2 was estimated by the Rayleigh PDF method, whereas the actual energy output was 920.24 kWh/m2 for the observed historical data in the period of 2009-2018. Due to the high uncertainties in the nature of wind flow and the limited research works in the field of renewable energy, the Rayleigh PDF approach overestimated the actual wind power output by 40\% in this work.

TI  - Potential Resilience to Ocean Acidification of Benthic Foraminifers Living in Posidonia oceanica Meadows: The Case of the Shallow Venting Site of Panarea
AB  - This research shows the results regarding the response to acidic condition of the sediment and Posidonia foraminiferal assemblages collected around the Panarea Island. The Aeolian Archipelago represents a natural laboratory and a much-promising study site for multidisciplinary marine research (carbon capture and storage, geochemistry of hydrothermal fluids and ocean acidification vs. benthic and pelagic organisms). The variability and the complexity of the interaction of the ecological factors characterizing extreme environments such as shallow hydrothermal vents did not allow us to carry out a real pattern of biota responses in situ, differently from those observed under controlled laboratory conditions. However, the study provides new insights into foraminiferal response to increasing ocean acidification (OA) in terms of biodiversity, faunal density, specific composition of the assemblages and morphological variations of the shells. The study highlights how the foraminiferal response to different pH conditions can change depending on different environmental conditions and microhabitats (sediments, Posidonia leaves and rhizomes). Indeed, mineral sediments were more impacted by acidification, whereas Posidonia microhabitats, thanks to their buffer effect, can offer ``refugia{''} and more mitigated acidic environment. At species level, rosalinids and agglutinated group represent the most abundant taxa showing the most specific resilience and capability to face acidic conditions.

TI  - Development of carbon dioxide capture and storage technology - Taiwan power company perspective
AB  - Carbon dioxide has been recognized as one of the main causes of global warming, and the emission of CO2 is inevitably encountered by the use of fossil fuels for electricity production in power plants. In consideration of reducing CO2 emission from power plant, the projects of advanced CO2 capture technology and off-shore geological CO2 storage are proposed and performed by Taiwan Power Company. In advanced CO2 capture technology project, the proposal of CaO/CaCO3 looping process pilot scale field test initiated by Industrial Technology Research Institute to be conducted in the collaboration between Bureau of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs and Taiwan Power Company is an important issue. Main tasks including potential site selection for geological CO2 storage and CO2 storage capacity estimated by TOUGH2 and TOUGHREACT simulation in the off-shore geological CO2 storage project. A potential site in the southern area of Taihsi basin for CO2 storage with approximately 4.518 Gt capacity is proposed in the project. With regard to the framework of carbon dioxide capture and storage projects, a timetable for carbon dioxide capture and storage pilot scale field tests is proposed by Taiwan Power Company.

TI  - Life cycle assessment of salinity gradient energy recovery by reverse electrodialysis in a seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant
AB  - Salinity gradient energy capture by reverse electrodialysis (SGE-RED) can play a part in the shift away from fossil fuels towards a carbon-neutral renewable energy supply; however, like other renewable power technologies, SGE-RED environmental soundness hinges on its whole life-cycle environmental loads. This study surveys the Life Cycle Assessment of SGE-RED technology. We quantified (i) the environmental loads per 1.0 kW h generated by a stand-alone RED unit and then, (ii) the environmental burdens related to the energy provision from an up-scaled RED system to a seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination plant per 1.0 m(3)of desalted water. The RED unit's assessment results show that SGE-RED is environmentally competitive with other renewable sources such as photovoltaics or wind. Regarding the component's contribution analysis, the spacer's fabric material drives the RED environmental burden as the number of cell pairs is increased. The scaling-up of the RED unit, however, improves its full environmental profile. Preliminary results of SGE-RED combination with a SWRO plant suggest that the energy harnessed from SWRO's concentrate streams by RED could enhance the environmental performance of the desalination industry. Further research is required to identify SWRO-RED design alternatives that minimize the life cycle burden while still yielding good technical and economic performance.

TI  - A simplified four phase compositional simulator for asphaltene evaluation
AB  - One of the most promising Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) methods is CO2 injection. However, if the oil contains asphaltenes, CO2 injection may cause asphaltene precipitation and introduce production related challenges. Conventional three-phase (gas/oil/water) compositional simulators are unable to predict precipitation of asphaltenes and multiphase compositional simulators are required. The use of detailed multiphase equilibrium calculations is very CPU intensive and commercial simulation packages often employ a hybrid model that may not capture the true physics at play. Conflicting findings have been reported from experimental and theoretical studies: Some studies show that Asphaltene deposition, due to CO2 injection, takes place near the injection well, while others have reported that asphaltene deposition occurs near the production well. True multiphase equilibrium calculations can be used to demonstrate that both findings are possible and that many factors will affect the deposition behavior. Accordingly, a general statement such as CO2 injection causes more asphaltene precipitation relative to hydrocarbon (HC) gas injection is not always true. This added complexity indicates the need for multiphase compositional simulation to delineate asphaltene deposition behavior and quantity. In this work, we propose a four-phase compositional simulator (gas/oil/asphaltene/water) to predict the asphaltene precipitation during CO2 and HC gas injection processes. A new hybrid formulation, based on a simple table look-up approach, is introduced to replace detailed multiphase calculations (gas/oil/ asphaltene) at a CPU requirement that is comparable to two-phase (gas/oil) equilibrium calculations. A range of simulation models/scenarios are presented to test and validate the new formulation against detailed multiphase compositional simulation, and we demonstrate an excellent agreement between the hybrid model and the full multiphase calculations. The proposed approach is easy to implement in commercial tools and provides a path to allow for more detailed studies of asphaltene precipitation and related production challenges.

TI  - Numerical study on the formations of gas channels and subsequent bubbles in unconsolidated sandy seabed sediment using a coupled LBM-DEM method
AB  - Carbon dioxide capture and storage is an efficient technology to reduce CO2. A candidate CO2 reservoir is a sub-seabed aquifer under the cap rock. However, there is a risk of CO2 leakage even though such probability is low. Once CO2 seeps at the seafloor, it forms bubbles/droplets and dissolves during their rise. The rising speed and the dissolution rate significantly depend on the bubble/droplet size. Interestingly, past observations of natural seepage of CO2 indicated that the bubble/droplet sizes were not very different, regardless of the seepage depths. In this study, a numerical method to simulate 3D solid-liquid-gas three-phase flow in the unconsolidated particle layers was developed and applied to elucidate the influences of gas flux, porosity, and particle size on the formations of gas channels and subsequent bubbles. The results suggested that the bubble size did not depend on the flux, but on the gas channel size at the level of gas flux expected in possible seepage events. Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Exergy analysis of petroleum offshore platform process plant with CO2 capture
AB  - Primary petroleum processing operations in offshore platforms require significant quantities of energy for extraction, processing and transport. In many offshore platforms these energy requirements are provided by locally produced gas and gas turbines are generally used to generate electricity required for operational activities such as driving pumps and compressors. Releases of gaseous emissions are an integral and inevitable part of the process and CO2-emissions occur principally from the combustion of gas for power generation and heat production. This paper presents the formulation and simulation to evaluate the exergy performance of the processes in an offshore platform considering two configurations: with and without CO2capture system. Exergy balance formulations have been used to assess the performance of the configurations. Simulations have been developed using Aspen HYSYSÂ®. Exergy analysis results are useful to assess the sustainability of such processes as well as to identify improvements for the offshore plant configuration.

TI  - Economic evaluation of offshore storage potential in the US Exclusive Economic Zone
AB  - Drawing upon previously published results, we evaluate the offshore potential for storing CO2 within marine sediments located inside the US Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). We then model the cost for transporting and injecting CO2 into these strata, including into deep-marine (&gt;3000m water depth) strata that we refer to as being 'self-sealing' because pressure and temperature regimes would form an overlying gravitational seal. Finally, we compare the integrated transport and injection cost estimates for self-sealing and non-self-sealing offshore storage against the same integrated cost estimates for onshore storage in 15 deep-saline sandstone aquifers located throughout the continental USA. The comparison is presented in the form of marginal abatement cost curves, which show that ocean storage is likely to be two or more times as expensive as onshore storage: 500 million tonnes of annual CO2 emissions from coal-fi red power plants in the USA is available for &lt;$5/tonne in onshore DSAs, &lt; $10/ tonne in non-self-sealing offshore strata, and &lt;$15/tonne in self-sealing offshore strata, with the cost differential between onshore and offshore storage increasing further up the supply curve. The higher total offshore costs are due to a combination of increases in transport and storage costs, with transport costs dominating total costs with increasing distance from shore. This suggests that CO2 capture system operators would have to pay substantially more for offshore geologic storage over onshore options. The cost difference may be mitigated by certain advantages of offshore storage, which could include easier access to property rights, simplifi ed regulation, and possibly lower monitoring, measurement, and verifi cation (MMV) requirements.

TI  - CO2 containment sees Northern Light
AB  - Research into developing a suitable transportation solution for liquid CO2 transportation received a major boost when Norway's DNV GL concluded pre-class evaluation of Type C containment tanks for liquefied CO2 for the Northern Lights Carbon Capture and Storage project in October 2019. By combining a high-pressure low-temperature containment system with the design, the cost of the solution is reduced. Subject to Norway government approval and funding in 2020, a full-scale CO2 capture and storage chain could be established by 2023/2024, with an initial storage capacity for up to 1.5 million ton/year of CO2. This requires the construction of two specialized liquid CO2 carriers, each of which would transport CO2 from one of the project's two initial capture sites in Norway to a dedicated onshore facility. The liquid CO2 cargo would then be transported by subsea pipeline to an offshore injection well, before being stored at a 3000 m depth below the seabed. The scheme is intended to have an eventual storage capacity of up to 5 million ton/year. The project has wider applicability for alternative fuels as commercial transportation of green CO2 is seen as a prerequisite for the expansion of power-to-X solutions to reduce the greenhouse gas footprint of synthetic methane or synthetic diesel fuels produced from H2 and CO2.

TI  - Hydrate formation from liquid CO2 in a glass beads bed
AB  - CO2 sequestration in marine sediments as solid hydrates is a potential way to capture and store anthropogenic CO2. In this study, hydrate formation from liquid CO(2 )in marine sediments was simulated in a glass beads bed, and the factors affecting the kinetics of hydrate formation were investigated. The results indicated that the rapid initial hydrate formation with a high driving force always increases the mass transfer resistance, which slows down hydrate growth. The final ratio of water conversion is higher under conditions of low temperature and higher pressure. A smaller particle size is conductive to initial CO2 hydrate growth, but the water conversion ratio in a bed with larger particles is slightly higher. Compared with other factors, the change in water saturation has an obvious effect on the final water conversion. To inhibit the initial hydrate formation during the injection process, in this paper, a kinetic inhibitor is proposed for pre-injection into marine sediments. This work shows that at a low pressure, a low-concentration inhibitor has an obvious inhibition effect on hydrate growth. However, at a high pressure, it is necessary to increase the concentration of inhibitor to produce an obvious inhibition effect.

TI  - Role of crystal structure on CO2 capture by limestone derived CaO subjected to carbonation/recarbonation/calcination cycles at Ca-looping conditions
AB  - Large scale pilot plants are currently demonstrating the feasibility of the Calcium-looping (CaL) technology built on the multicyclic calcination/carbonation of natural limestone for post-combustion and precombustion CO2 capture. Yet, limestone derived CaO exhibits a drop of conversion when subjected to multiple carbonation/calcination cycles, which lessens the efficiency of the technology. In this paper we analyze a novel CaL concept recently proposed to mitigate this drawback based on the introduction of an intermediate stage wherein carbonation is intensified at high temperature and high CO2 partial pressure. It is shown that carbonation in this stage is mainly driven by solid-state diffusion, which is determined by the solid's crystal structure. Accordingly, a reduction of crystallinity by ball milling, which favors diffusion, serves to promote recarbonation. Conversely, thermal annealing, which enhances crystallinity, hinders recarbonation. An initial fast phase has been identified in the recarbonation stage along which the rate of carbonation is also a function of the crystal structure indicating a relevant role of surface diffusion. This is consistent with a recently proposed mechanism for nucleation of CaCO3 on the CaO surface in islands with a critical size determined by surface diffusion. A further issue analyzed has been the effects of pretreatment and cycling on the mechanical strength of the material, whose fragility hampers the CaL process efficiency. Particle size distribution of samples dispersed in a liquid and subjected to high energy ultrasonic irradiation indicate that milling promotes friability whereas thermal annealing enhances the resistance of the particles to fragmentation even though pretreatment effects become blurred after cycling. Our study demonstrates that recarbonation conditions and crystal-structure controlled diffusion are important parameters to be considered in order to assess the efficiency of CO2 capture in the novel CaL concept.

TI  - The relationship between a â€˜polluter paysâ€™ approach to carbon capture, regional policy and â€˜just transitionâ€™ employment agendas
AB  - Policy makers in a number of nations are currently developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) as an industrial decarbonisation solution, linking capture potential in industry clusters to domestic or overseas offshore storage capacity. However, the design, focus and timeframe for policy support are proving challenging in countries like the UK, where industry actors are concerned about the competitiveness implications of additional operational capital costs, while government aims to offer only transitory policy support. Policy-facing research is required to understand the drivers, nature and extent of potential competitiveness loss from adopting carbon capture in specific industry and country contexts, along with the impacts of policy decisions in other countries and of possible future technology improvements. We consider the case of the UK chemicals industry, using an economy-wide computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. This highlights how macroeconomic and sectoral impacts of concern under regional, industry and climate policy agendas depend on domestic and export demand responses to changing industry prices. A crucial question is whether capture costs are similarly reflected in international prices. We identify a risk of policy commitment to â€˜polluter paysâ€™ having sustained negative outcomes for capture firms, along with offshoring/leakage of jobs and GDP, and associated emissions, as demand shifts to lower cost overseas production. However, such costs could be reduced, and some capture industry gains realised, if competitors in other nations ultimately follow in bearing similar costs and particularly if â€˜early moverâ€™ action enables firms to make efficiency gains and build comparative advantage in operational carbon capture. Key policy insights A â€˜polluter paysâ€™ approach to industrial carbon capture risks triggering potential â€˜offshoringâ€™ of manufacturing activity in all timeframes where increased operational costs reduce the relative competitiveness of capture firms. A border tax risks worse industry and wider economy outcomes, where domestic production is intensive in imports of the commodity in question. Transitory policy support should focus on enabling capture firms to build efficiency in using carbon capture equipment while sustaining competitiveness and jobs within regional industry clusters. Opportunities should be explored to develop comparative advantage where policy activity involves â€˜early moverâ€™ action on carbon capture. Â© 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Passive, continuous monitoring of carbon dioxide geostorage using muon tomography
AB  - Carbon capture and storage is a transition technology from a past and present fuelled by coal, oil and gas and a planned future dominated by renewable energy sources. The technology involves the capture of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel power stations and other point sources, compression of the CO2 into a fluid, transporting it and injecting it deep beneath the Earth's surface into depleted petroleum reservoirs and other porous formations. Once injected, the CO2 must be monitored to ensure that it is emplaced and assimilated as planned and that none leaks back to surface. A variety of methods have been deployed to monitor the CO2 storage site and many such methods have been adapted from oilfield practice. However, such methods are commonly indirect, episodic, require active signal generation and remain expensive throughout the monitoring period that may last for hundreds of years. A modelling framework was developed to concurrently simulate CO2 geostorage conditions and background cosmic-ray muon tomography, in which the potential was assessed for using variations in muon attenuation, due to changes in CO2 abundance, as a means of CO2 detection. From this, we developed a passive, continuous monitoring method for CO2 storage sites using muon tomography, the tools for which can be deployed during the active drilling phase (development) of the storage site. To do this, it was necessary to develop a muon detector that could be used in the hostile environment (saline, high temperature) of the well bore. A prototype detector has been built and tested at the 1.1 km deep Boulby potash mine on the northeast coast of England, supported by the existing STFC Boulby Underground Laboratory on the site. The detector is now ready to be commercialized. This article is part of the Theo Murphy meeting issue 'Cosmic-ray muography'. Â© 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

TI  - Geological CO 2 Capture and Storage with Flue Gas Hydrate Formation in Frozen and Unfrozen Sediments: Method Development, Real Time-Scale Kinetic Characteristics, Efficiency, and Clathrate Structural Transition
AB  - The climate system is changing globally, and there is substantial evidence that subsea permafrost and gas hydrate reservoirs are melting in high-latitude regions of the Earth, resulting in large volumes of CO 2 (from organic carbon deposits) and CH 4 (from gas hydrate reserves) venting into the atmosphere. Here, we propose the formation of flue gas hydrates in permafrost regions and marine sediments for both the geological storage of CO 2 and the secondary sealing of CH 4 /CO 2 release in one simple process, which could greatly reduce the cost of CO 2 capture and storage (CCS). The kinetics of flue gas hydrate formation inside frozen and unfrozen sediments was investigated under realistic conditions using a highly accurate method and a well-characterized system. The results are detailed over a wide range of temperatures and different pressures at in situ time scales. It has been found that more than 92 mol % of the CO 2 present in the injected flue gas could be captured under certain conditions. The effect of different relevant parameters on the kinetics of hydrate formation has been discussed, and compelling evidence for crystal-structure changes at high pressures has been observed. It has also been found that temperature rise leads to the release of N 2 first, with the retention of CO 2 in hydrates, which provides a secondary safety factor for stored CO 2 in the event of a sudden temperature increase.

TI  - Simulation of the potential effects of CO2 leakage from carbon capture and storage activities on the mobilization and speciation of metals
AB  - One of the main risks associated with carbon capture and storage (CCS) activities is the leakage of the stored CO2, which can result in several effects on the ecosystem. Laboratory-scale experiments were performed to provide data on the possible effects of CO2 leakage from CCS on the mobility of metals previously trapped in sediments. Metal-contaminated sediments were collected and submitted to acidification by means of CO2 injection using different pH treatments. The test lasted 10days, and samples were collected at the beginning and at the end of the experiment for metal analysis. The results revealed increases in the mobility of metals such as Co, Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn due to pH decreases. Geochemical modeling demonstrated that acidification influenced the speciation of the metals, increasing the concentrations of their free forms. These data suggest the possible sediment contamination consequences of accidental CO2 leakage during CCS activities. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we use repeated high-resolution seismic reflection surveys acquired using a chirp profiler mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), to image CO2 gas released into shallow sub-surface sediments above a potential CCS storage site at 120 m water depth in the North Sea. Observations of temporal changes in seismic reflectivity, attenuation, unit thickness and the bulk permeability of sediment were used to develop a four-stage model of the evolution of gas migration in shallow marine sediments: Proto-migration, Immature Migration, Mature Migration, and Pathway Closure. Bubble flow was initially enabled through the propagation of stable fractures but, over time, transitioned to dynamic fractures with an associated step change in permeability. Once the gas injection rate exceeded the rate at which gas could escape the coarser sediments overlying the injection point, gas began to pool along a grain size boundary. This enhanced understanding of the migration of free gas in near-surface sediments will help improve methods of detection and quantification of gas in subsurface marine sediments.

TI  - Engineering Consideration of Surface Facilities for a Candidate CCS Demonstration Project in Japan
AB  - This paper presents the results of careful considerations on the surface facilities at one of the most promising CCS (Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage) candidate sites in Japan in regards to process, economy and energy consumption. This site has been selected to demonstrate the feasibility of CCS total system in which CO2 is captured from natural gas processing plants, transported to the injection site (100km away from the plants), and then stored in the saline aquifers underneath the seabed of the Japan Sea. Four technical issues have been reviewed for the surface facilities, namely CO2 transportation, removal of impurities in the CO2 gas, the liquefied CO2 heater models and the shaft seal system for CO2 pumps. As for the CO2 transportation method, tanker trucks transportation is selected compared to pipelines because of the merits in a construction period, economy, and local citizen's understanding and acceptance which are crucial for the realization of the project. Concerning process building, removal of impurities contained in the CO2 gas has been considered first. CO2 gas separated from natural gas contains hydrogen sulfide, mercury, and BTX in addition to water. These impurities must be eliminated prior to liquefaction of CO2 because they could interfere with the process as well as for environmental considerations. The adsorption method is found to be effective for removing all these impurities. However, it is also found that adsorbent consumption rate depends largely on the process sequence with which the impurities are eliminated. After reviewing the results, it is found that the most economical sequence to eliminate these impurities is in the order of mercury, hydrogen sulfide, BTX, then water. Liquefied CO2 heater models have been considered to reduce CO2 emission. After transportation to the injection site, the liquefied CO2 is pressurized and heated from -10 degrees C to a super critical state of 40 degrees C in order to avoid phase transition inside the injection tube. Using a heat pump to utilize the heat in the air to improve the energy efficiency, CO2 emission is substantially reduced by approximately 70\% compared to the conventional method using hot water from a boiler that uses heavy fuel oil. A centrifugal pump will be selected for CO2 pumps because it can handle large volumes. An effective shaft seal system is the tandem formation using vapor-liquid seal and dry gas seal for the first and the second stages respectively. However, since we have limited experience of this formation at CO2 pumps in Japan, it is identified as a critical item in the demonstration project. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Long-term CO2 Emission Reduction from Renewable Energy in Power Sector: The case of Thailand in 2050
AB  - This paper presents CO2 mitigation potential in the power sector of Thailand regarding to the Power Development Plan (PDP 2015) and Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP 2015). Renewable energy and advanced technology have the potential to play an important role in providing clean energy. The Long-range Energy Alternative Planning (LEAP) model is used to analyze future electricity demand, fuel consumption and CO2 emissions reduction in the long term planning during 2010-2050. Regarding to those plans, implementations of renewable energy and advanced technology are proposed for mitigation options. The mitigation scenarios offer sustainable potential of renewable technologies and advanced technologies such as solar, wind, biomass, nuclear, hydropower, hydrogen fuel cell, tidal, geothermal and fossil-fuel power plants with carbon capture storage (CCS). Four mitigation scenarios are modeled along with the BAU scenario. The Mitigation 1 (MIT01) scenario is the base-case mitigation scenario based on the target of PDP2015, which target of renewable energy is 19,634 MW in 2036. In the Mitigation 2 (MIT02) scenario, the technologies in the MIT01 plus new technologies such as hydrogen fuel cell, tidal and geothermal are implemented. Clean fossil fuel technologies with CCS, for example natural gas and coal technologies, are applied in the Mitigation 3 (MIT03) scenario. In the Mitigation 4 (MIT04) scenario as the peak CO2 scenario. Results show that, in the BAU scenario, electricity demand and CO2 emissions from the power sector will increase to 52,770 ktoe and 345,959 kt-CO2eq, respectively in 2050. By adopting mitigation options, total CO2 emissions in 2050 can be mitigated by 69.66% in MIT04, following by 50.83% in MIT02, 47.22% in MIT03, and 41.71% in MIT01 when compared to the BAU scenario. Moreover, regarding to the MIT04, Thailand can meet its peak CO2 emission by 2036. Â© 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Techno-economic comparison of onshore and offshore Underground Coal Gasification end-product competitiveness
AB  - Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) enables the utilisation of coal reserves that are currently not economically exploitable due to complex geological boundary conditions. Hereby, UCG produces a high-calorific synthesis gas that can be used for generation of electricity, fuels and chemical feedstock. The present study aims to identify economically competitive, site-specific end-use options for onshore and offshore produced UCG synthesis gas, taking into account the capture and storage (CCS) and/or utilisation (CCU) of resulting CO2. Modelling results show that boundary conditions that favour electricity, methanol and ammonia production expose low costs for air separation, high synthesis gas calorific values and H2/N2 shares as well as low CO2 portions of max. 10%. Hereby, a gasification agent ratio of more than 30% oxygen by volume is not favourable from economic and environmental viewpoints. Compared to the costs of an offshore platform with its technical equipment, offshore drilling costs are negligible. Thus, uncertainties related to parameters influenced by drilling costs are also negligible. In summary, techno-economic process modelling results reveal that scenarios with high CO2 emissions are the most cost-intensive ones, offshore UCG-CCS/CCU costs are twice as high as the onshore ones, and yet all investigated scenarios except from offshore ammonia production are competitive on the European market.

TI  - Post-combustion carbon capture for tank to propeller via process modeling and simulation
AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has issued a long-term sustainable strategy to gradually phase out the major ship-related sources of greenhouse gas emissions. While the post-combustion carbon capture has been well investigated for onshore plants, the maritime carbon capture system is still in an early stage due to its unique characteristics and design limitations. Aiming at providing a holistic way to find the most efficient and sustainable PCC solution for an LNG tanker, this work proposed a system of the tank to propeller post-combustion carbon capture which integrates ship engine process modeling with chemical absorption/desorption process modeling techniques. A rate-based aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) process model was developed and validated, then scaled up and modified to capture CO2 from the flue gas. To increase the carbon capture efficiency and decrease the energy penalty, this work provided detailed steps for process model development covering innovative absorber/stripper design under variation of solvents, packed type, and liquid to gas ratio. This work also included a thorough sustainability evaluation based on emission reduction efficiency, energy penalty, and carbon cyclic capacity among two single aqueous amines, MEA and diisopropanolamine (DIPA), and one blended amine with a promoter, methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) with piperazine (PZ). Although DIPA presented a better performance on energy requirement for solvent regeneration, the blended amine was the optimal solvent to meet the requirement of the IMO carbon abatement strategy. Compared to the seven molality MEA, the MDEA-PZ option could capture more than 57 % CO2 while around 25 % specific reboiler duty can be saved. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - EXERGETIC ASSESSMENT OF A SYNGAS-REDOX (SGR)-BASED IGCC PLANT FOR GENERATING ELECTRICITY
AB  - Carbon capture from advanced Integrated Gasification Combined-Cycle (IGCC) processes should outperform conventional coal combustion with subsequent CO2 separation in terms of efficiency and CO2 capture rates. This paper provides a thermodynamic assessment, using exergy analysis, of a novel Syngas Redox (SGR) process for generating electricity. The power island of the proposed process uses syngas produced by coal gasification and then cleaned through high-temperature gas desulfurization (HGD). Hematite (Fe2O3) is used as an oxygen carrier to oxidize the syngas. To achieve a closed-cycle operation, the reduced iron particles are first partially re-oxidized with steam and then fully re-oxidized with pressurized air. One advantage of this design is that the resulting hydrogen (using steam in the re-oxidation section) can be utilized within the same plant or be on sold as a secondary product. In the proposed process, diluted hydrogen is combusted in a gas turbine. Heat integration is central to the design. The different requirements of syngas cooling, particle-regeneration, and coal drying necessitated the use of a heat-recovery steam generator (HRSG) supplying steam at three pressure levels. To establish a benchmark, the rate of exergy destruction within the SGR process was compared to a coal-fed Shell gasification IGCC design with Selexol-based pre-combustion capture. Process simulation was undertaken using Aspen Plus and EES (Engineering Equation Solver).

TI  - Reduction of GHG emissions by geological storage of CO2 Anatomy of the Heartland Aquifer Redwater Carbon Capture and Geological Storage Project (HARP), Alberta, Canada
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify and characterize a geological storage site at more than 800m depth that is capable of storing large quantities of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Alberta Basin and is close to a large CO2 supply. Design/methodology/approach - Five criteria are used to select the site: total volume of the pore space of the formation for CO2 (i.e. capacity); accessibility of the pore space in the storage site to CO2 (i.e. permeability or injectivity); ability of the storage site to retain the CO2 once the CO2 has been injected (i.e. containment); protection of other resources from contamination; and cost of the whole process: capture of the CO2, transport and storage (i.e. economics). Findings - The Heartland Redwater Leduc Reef is identified as a site that has large capacity, good injectivity, and is an excellent trap. Contamination of the oil in the oil reservoir at the top of the reef (the third largest oil reservoir in Canada) is avoided by co-optimizing CO2 storage and oil production. Practical implications - The Heartland Redwater Leduc Reef is ideally located at relatively shallow depth (1,000-1,200 m), has a large amount of residual oil and is close to large CO2 sources which make it one of the most economically attractive sites in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Originality/value - The Heartland Redwater Leduc Reef Saline Aquifer CO2 Capture and Geological Storage Project (HARP) is investigating the technical and economic feasibility of injecting significant volumes of CO2 into the large water-saturated portion of a huge Devonian reef that is capped by a comparatively small oil reservoir, nevertheless the third largest oil pool in Canada. The reef has a total areal extent of nearly 600 km(3), is more than 1,000m deep and is up to 275m thick. Based on the high-water injectivity in the reef, the potential exists to inject sustainably in excess of 1,000 tonnes of CO2 per day per well in the aquifer portion of the reef. Preliminary storage capacity estimates for the aquifer are in the order of one gigatonne of CO2. The Heartland Redwater Leduc Reef has the combination of a large oil reservoir sitting on top of a much larger local aquifer. This is a unique site for storage in Canada and could be a model for the rest of the world for carbon dioxide capture and storage.

TI  - The radiative forcing potential of different climate geoengineering options
AB  - Climate geoengineering proposals seek to rectify the Earth's current and potential future radiative imbalance, either by reducing the absorption of incoming solar (shortwave) radiation, or by removing CO2 from the atmosphere and transferring it to long-lived reservoirs, thus increasing outgoing longwave radiation. A fundamental criterion for evaluating geoengineering options is their climate cooling effectiveness, which we quantify here in terms of radiative forcing potential. We use a simple analytical approach, based on energy balance considerations and pulse response functions for the decay of CO2 perturbations. This aids transparency compared to calculations with complex numerical models, but is not intended to be definitive. It allows us to compare the relative effectiveness of a range of proposals. We consider geoengineering options as additional to large reductions in CO2 emissions. By 2050, some land carbon cycle geoengineering options could be of comparable magnitude to mitigation `wedges', but only stratospheric aerosol injections, albedo enhancement of marine stratocumulus clouds, or sunshades in space have the potential to cool the climate back toward its pre-industrial state. Strong mitigation, combined with global-scale air capture and storage, afforestation, and bio-char production, i.e. enhanced CO2 sinks, might be able to bring CO2 back to its pre-industrial level by 2100, thus removing the need for other geoengineering. Alternatively, strong mitigation stabilising CO2 at 500 ppm, combined with geoengineered increases in the albedo of marine stratiform clouds, grasslands, croplands and human settlements might achieve a patchy cancellation of radiative forcing. Ocean fertilisation options are only worthwhile if sustained on a millennial timescale and phosphorus addition may have greater long-term potential than iron or nitrogen fertilisation. Enhancing ocean upwelling or downwelling have trivial effects on any meaningful timescale. Our approach provides a common framework for the evaluation of climate geoengineering proposals, and our results should help inform the prioritisation of further research into them.

TI  - Large-scale CCS transport and storage networks in North-west and Central Europe
AB  - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is one of the measures that can be used to reduce CO2 emissions to the atmosphere in Europe. Of the total CCS chain the transport infrastructure may be the most planning and guidance-intensive part during the development of large-scale CCS. The EU FP7 CO(2)Europipe project aims to pave the road towards large-scale, Europe-wide infrastructure for the transport and injection of CO2 from large point sources. The study presented here is part of that project and presents an assessment of the North-west and Central European sources and sinks of CO2; matching of the sources and sinks is performed in order to identify likely future transport routes and the volumes that can be expected to be transported. The results are presented in maps with major transport corridors. The matching shows that, theoretically, sufficient storage capacity is available up to 2050, with the main part located in the North Sea. Aquifers are to play an important part in the storage and thus require early exploration activities. Infrastructure networks will be extensive and pipeline construction will need to be performed at a fast pace between 2020 and 2050 to make sure that transport can occur between the source clusters and the storage fields in time. To achieve this, international co-operation is required since cross-border transport will be inevitable if the EU is to achieve its GHG emission reduction target. Also, necessary legal frameworks for CCS need to be in place in each affected country to allow this process to go ahead. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A FILL-AND-SPILL CCS MEGA-FAIRWAY IN THE SOUTHERN NORTH SEA: A NEW CONCEPT TO OPTIMISE CO2 STORAGE
AB  - A potential carbon capture and storage (CCS) fill-and-spill mega-fairway is here identified in UKCS Quadrants 43-44, by combining regional wellbore data with 3D seismic interpretation and migration modelling. In the study area, the Triassic Bunter Sandstone reservoir shows consistent thicknesses (90-216 m) and prospective core-based porosities and permeabilities (11-28%, 9-669 mD). A connected reservoir is suggested regionally from consistent, near-hydrostatic aquifer pressure gradients (~0.51 psi/ft) and leakage is mitigated through a thick, laterally-effective top seal. Structural closures in the area are generally less than the CO2 column heights necessary to breach the seal. At least eleven mapped closures are shown to link together into the proposed regional fill-and-spill â€œSilverpit CCS Fairwayâ€. If filled to spill, these traps could cumulatively host up to 7.9 Gt of CO2, three times that of the proposed Endurance CCS Field. Through management of the injection and fill-spill strategy, this fairway could be future-proofed in relation to CO2 spill hazards, whilst possibly requiring less 'injector hubs' to fill the traps. Migration spill-point modelling along the fairway may also inform the placement of permanent, cost-effective multi-physics seabed system for leakage and migration monitoring. Exploiting fill-and-spill fairways for CCS is a new concept with vast potential applicability globally. Â© (2021) by the European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers (EAGE)All rights reserved.

TI  - Capture Chamber Modelling and Validation in OWC on-shore Devices
AB  - Climate change is challenging the current worldwide model of power generation. In this sense, European Union is promoting a deep transition collected in the 20-20-20 targets and the 2050 Energy Roadmap. These adjectives must be achieved by developing the use of clean, carbon-free energies, as it is the case of the renewableenergies and in particular of the ocean energy. The main problem with these kinds of energies is to reach a commercially mature stage so they can compete with conventional power sources. Therefore, it is crucial to reduce generation costs and increase the efficiency of the existing devices. With this regard, thework presents the modelling and experimental validation of the capture chamber of an Oscillating Water Column (OWC)-based powerplant. Although the study of the turbine and the generator may be considered a quite well-known matter, the control-oriented modelling of the capture chamber still deserves a further study to improve the power generation. In this work, a model obtained analytically of the OWC chamber is developed and numerically implemented. The model proposed is also validated and affords excellent results.

TI  - CO2 mobility control improvement using N2-foam at high pressure and high temperature conditions
AB  - The high mobility of CO2 in porous media is an issue in most subsurface CO2 projects worldwide, demonstrated by uncontrolled and rapid migration through the reservoir, early well breakthroughs and poor sweep efficiency. Improved mobility control of CO2 is needed to accelerate and improve the value-creation from subsurface CO2 projects, both in terms of energy produced and volumes of CO2 stored. Field-proven conformance and mobility control techniques, such as foam, provide a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to overcome geological and process constraints observed with CO2 flow in reservoirs. In this laboratory study, we have investigated CO2 mobility control by foam in sandstone core samples at typical North Sea reservoir conditions, 220 barg and 100Â°C, respectively. Two important aspects related to any field application of foam have been evaluated and discussed: I) Can strong CO2-foams be generated at reservoir conditions using AOS surfactant? If not, II) can relatively simple modifications to the foam system be made to improve foam properties and CO2 mobility control? Our results show that only high-mobility CO2-foams with low degree of CO2 mobility reduction are obtained at 220 barg and 100Â°C. An easy way to improve the foam properties at reservoir conditions is suggested by changing the gas-phase in foam to nitrogen (N2). The N2-foams display improved foam generation performance, larger mobility control in terms of mobility reduction factors (MRF) and ability to block subsequent CO2 injection. An alternative strategy for applying foam for CO2 conformance and mobility control in subsurface CO2 projects, which emerges from this study, is to initiate the foam treatment with nitrogen followed by subsequent CO2 injection to change the main direction of CO2 flow to enhance the displacement area or reduce uncontrolled CO2 production between the injecting and producing wells (as illustrated in the graphical abstract). The possible mechanisms explaining the observed differences in foam properties using CO2 versus N2, including implications that could be helpful for future studies and CO2 field applications are discussed further in more detail. The efficiency and limitations of miscible CO2 flooding to recover oil and simultaneously store CO2 after extensive water flooding are also demonstrated in this article, which are relevant to enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and subsequent CO2 storage applications, known as the Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS).

TI  - The UK Liability Framework for the Transport of CO2 for Offshore Carbon Capture and Storage Operations
AB  - Carbon (dioxide) capture and storage (CCS) is one of the solutions for decarbonising society whereby CO2 is captured, transported, and injected into geological formations. It can be transported to offshore locations through pipelines or ships. Which method provides for a better deal for investors depends to an extent on the financial risk associated with these two methods, which in turn is linked with exposure to liability. This paper compares the potential liability arising from the carriage of CO2 by ships and by pipelines in the UK offshore context. The two modes of transport are governed by significantly different regimes, even though they concern the same material. It is argued that the transport of CO2 by ships and by pipelines poses similar risks and therefore they should have a similar liability regime. This would afford pipeline operators the economic advantages available to shipowners and incentivise investment in the transport phase of CCS.

TI  - Impacts of geological store uncertainties on the design and operation of flexible CCS offshore pipeline infrastructure
AB  - Planning for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) infrastructure needs to address the impact of store uncertainties and store flow variability on infrastructure costs and availability. Key geological storage properties (pressure, temperature, depth and permeability) can affect injectivity and lead to variations in CO2 flow, which feed back into the pipeline transportation system. In previous storage models, the interface between the reservoir performance and the transportation infrastructure is unclear and the models are unable to provide details for flow and pressure management within a transportation network in response to changes in the operation of storage sites. Variation in storage demand due to daily and seasonal variations of fossil fuels uses and by extension CO2 flow is also likely to influence transportation infrastructure availability and the capacity to deliver. This work evaluates, at the level of infrastructure planning, the impact of geological uncertainty on CCS pipeline transportation and injection infrastructure. The analysis presented shows how to consider uncertainty in store properties in combination with CO2 flow variability to estimate the likely impact on pipeline infrastructure design. The operational envelope of the storage site infrastructure is estimated by combining the Darcy flow analysis of simple reservoir models with rigorous process simulation of the storage site wells. The proximity of wellhead conditions to the CO2 equilibrium line and the maximum velocities inside the well constrain the operational envelope of the storage site and limit the ability of the storage site infrastructure to handle CO2 flow variation. These factors, which are significantly influenced by variations in subsurface conditions, have also an impact on the design of the offshore pipeline infrastructure, needing to accommodate changes in pressure delivery requirements. Based on the evaluation of examples developed for different offshore transportation scenarios relevant to the United Kingdom, detailed insight on the expected impacts of store properties on pipeline transportation infrastructure design and operation is provided. For instance, it is found that enabling storage site flexibility is simpler in stores with an initial pressure above 20 MPa. Given reductions in reservoir permeability, the requirements for pressure delivery are strongly dependent on the store temperature. Although the analysis is performed for specific geological characteristics in the North Sea the evaluation methodology is transferable to other locations and can be used for site screening to identify sites which are more flexible in terms of uncertainty in store performance.

TI  - The potential of renewables versus natural gas with CO2 capture and storage for power generation under CO2 constraints
AB  - The costs of intermittent renewable energy systems (IRES) and power storage technologies are compared on a level playing field to those of natural gas combined cycle power plants with CO2 capture and storage (NGCC-CCS). To account for technological progress over time, an "experience curve" approach is used to project future levelised costs of electricity (LCOE) based on technology progress ratios and deployment rates in worldwide energy scenarios, together with European energy and technology cost estimates. Under base case assumptions, the LCOE in 2040 for baseload NGCC-CCS plants is estimated to be 71 â‚¬2012/MWh. In contrast, the LCOE for electricity generated intermittently from IRES is estimated at 68, 82, and 104 â‚¬2012/MWh for concentrated solar power, offshore wind, and photovoltaic systems, respectively. Considering uncertainties in costs, deployment rates and geographical conditions, LCOE ranges for IRES are wider than for NGCC-CCS. We also assess energy storage technologies versus NGCC-CCS as backup options for IRES. Here, for base case assumptions NGCC-CCS with an LCOE of 90 â‚¬2012/MWh in 2040 is more costly than pumped hydro storage (PHS) or compressed air and energy storage (CAES) with LCOEs of 57 and 88 â‚¬2012/MWh, respectively. Projected costs for battery backup are 78, 149, and 321 â‚¬2012/MWh for Zn-Br, ZEBRA, and Li-ion battery systems, respectively. Finally, we compare four stylised low-carbon systems on a common basis (including all ancillary costs for IRES). In the 2040 base case, the system employing only NGCC-CCS has the lowest LCOE and lowest cost of CO2 avoided with CO2 emissions of 45 kg/MWh. A zero CO2 emission system with IRES plus PHS as backup is 42% more expensive in terms of LCOE, and 13% more costly than a system with IRES plus NGCC-CCS backup with emissions of 23 kg CO2/MWh. Sensitivity results and study limitations are fully discussed within the paper. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Benthic foraminifera show some resilience to ocean acidification in the northern Gulf of California, Mexico
AB  - Extensive CO2 vents have been discovered in the Wagner Basin, northern Gulf of California, where they create large areas with lowered seawater pH. Such areas are suitable for investigations of long-term biological effects of ocean acidification and effects of CO2 leakage from subsea carbon capture storage. Here, we show responses of benthic foraminifera to seawater pH gradients at 74-207m water depth. Living (rose Bengal stained) benthic foraminifera included Nonionella basispinata, Epistominella bradyana and Bulimina marginata. Studies on foraminifera at CO2 vents in the Mediterranean and off Papua New Guinea have shown dramatic long-term effects of acidified seawater.

TI  - Viability of Technologies for CO2 Capture and Reuse in a FPSO: Technical, Economic and Environmental Analysis
AB  - The recent discoveries of Pre-Salt layers in Brazil require process developments for enhanced sustainability as these reservoirs have oil with associated natural gas exhibiting an expressive amount of CO2. Monetization of CO2 by offshore production of methanol in a dedicated FPSO - MFPSO - is a potential alternative to sustainable E\&P. Two process alternatives for an MPFSO were previously investigated by the authors, consisting of physical absorption of CO2 with propylene carbonate and its conversion to yield methanol. Alternative 1 combines dry and steam reforming in one reactor (Bi-Reforming), while Alternative 2 segregates the two reactions - dry reforming occurs in one reactor and water gas-shift reaction in a subsequent reactor. Both alternatives considered Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) as a parallel path for CO2 destination. The economic evaluation employed the software Capital Cost Estimation (CAPCOST) for calculations of CAPEX and OPEX. The software Waste Reduction Algorithm (WAR, EPA) was used to evaluate the potential environmental impacts. The analysis indicated that the performance of Alternative 1 was superior to the performance of Alternative 2: (a) methanol production (17.9 t/h) 4 times higher, (b) lower CAPEX, (c) sales revenue 181\% greater, and (d) the potential environmental impact (PEI) 47.7\% lower (868 PEI/h). In the present work, Alternative 1was modified by eliminating the EOR step, resulting in enhancement of methanol production as CO2 was integrally designated to chemical conversion. The modified process (Alternative 3) inherits the environmental feasibility of Alternative 1 and, through elimination of the EOR compression train, has the potential of positive impacts on CAPEX.

TI  - A criteria-driven approach to the CO2 storage site selection of East Mey for the acorn project in the North Sea
AB  - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is an essential tool in the fight against climate change. Any prospective storage site must meet various criteria that ensure the effectiveness, safety and economic viability of the storage operations. Finding the most suitable site for the storage of the captured CO2 is an essential part of the CCS chain of activity. This work addresses the site selection of a second site for the Acorn CCS project, a project designed to develop a scalable, full-chain CCS project in the North Sea (offshore northeast Scotland). This secondary site has been designed to serve as a backup and upscaling option for the Acorn Site, and has to satisfy pivotal project requirements such as low cost and high storage potential. The methodology followed included the filtering of 113 input sites from the UK CO2Stored database, according to general and project-specific criteria in a multi-staged approach. This criteria-driven workflow allowed for an early filtering out of the less suitable sites, followed by a more comprehensive comparison and ranking of the 15 most suitable sites. A due diligence assessment was conducted of the top six shortlisted sites to produce detailed assessment of their storage properties and suitability, including new geological interpretation and capacity calculations for each site. With the new knowledge generated during this process, a critical comparison of the sites led to selection of East Mey as the most suitable site, due to its outstanding storage characteristics and long-lasting hydrocarbon-production history, that ensure excellent data availability to risk-assess storage structures. A workshop session was held to present methods and results to independent stakeholders; feedback informed the final selection criteria. This paper provides an example of a criteria-driven approach to site selection that can be applied elsewhere.

TI  - Future fuels: Could turbines powered by hydrogen help the UK cope with its variable energy supply?
AB  - The Energy Technologies Institute (ETI) is studying national network of turbines configured to run on hydrogen, which would be generated by gasification of fossil fuels and stored underground in salt caverns, mainly offshore. ETI's strategy is called the Energy Systems Modeling Environment, or ESME, which is a national tool that looks at the whole energy system, generation, distribution, storage and consumption and looks at finding the lowest-cost solution. The advantage of configuring turbines to burn hydrogen, rather than to operate directly on fossil fuels, is that it strips the carbon away from the fuel and captures it at source, rather than having to capture it post-combustion. While the ETI is currently working with the British Geological Survey (BGS) surveying possible sites for salt caverns, engineering contractor Foster Wheeler is investigating the scale, configuration and cost of the gasifiers and turbines required to provide the generation capacity that would be needed for such a system, tens of gigawatts.

TI  - Upfront: 'Green' technology removes carbon dioxide from natural gas
AB  - A team of researchers in the Queen's University Ionic Liquid Laboratories (QUILL) Research Centre at Queen's University Belfast has developed an innovative technology that uses a mixture of water and ionic liquids to remove CO2 from raw natural gas extracted from natural reservoirs under the sea. The new ionic liquid system is compact enough to be used on offshore platforms or installed on land-based gas-processing plants. Once captured, the CO2 may be stored, reprocessed, or used for enhanced oil recovery. This new technology is safer, more efficient, and more environmentally friendly than conventional amine purifying systems. The process is intended to reduce the global environmental and economic costs of purifying natural gas, the cleanest burning fuel available in large amounts.

TI  - COUPLED PHYSICS PERFORMANCE PREDICTIONS AND RISK ASSESSMENT FOR DRY GAS SEAL OPERATING IN MW-SCALE SUPERCRITICAL CO2 TURBINE
AB  - U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has recently sponsored research programs to develop megawatt scale supercritical CO2 (sCO2) turbine for use in concentrated solar power (CSP) and fossil based applications. To achieve the CSP goal of power at \$0.06/kW-hr LCOE and energy conversion efficiency > 50\%, the sCO2 turbine relies critically on extremely low leakage film riding seals like dry gas seal (DGS). Although DGS technology has been used in other applications before. making it successful for stringent conditions of an sCO2 turbo-expander is challenging. This paper presents results from a multi-scale coupled physics model that predicts the performance of DGS under a typical sCO2 turbine mission cycle and addresses some of the risks specific to operation in sCO2. Real gas equations of state are incorporated in the models to capture large discontinuities in fluid properties close to the critical point. A novel experimental setup is developed to observe and characterize transition of CO2 through liquid-vapor and supercritical phases. Coupled fluid-structure-thermal interaction model investigates the effect of aerodynamic and thermal perturbations on the structural and rotordynamic instabilities. Dynamic instabilities arising from sonic transition in thin sCO2 film of DGS pose additional challenges while the large surface roughness changes due to sCO2 corrosion warrant further design considerations. Effectiveness of features like spiral grooves in converting fluid momentum into pressure rise in the thin film and also in achieving local flow reversals is investigated. Effect of various design features on the optimal performance is quantified and insights for a successful DGS operation in a sCO2 turbomachine are provided.

TI  - Optimization of ship-based CCS
AB  - This study developed an economic evaluation model for CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) chain where pipelines and ships were expected to come into play in transporting CO2 from power plants to offshore storage sites. In case of ship-based transportation, several alternatives with various operating conditions were feasible, demanding optimization of the transportation mode. The ship-based CCS chain is consisted of six segments: compression system, pipeline, refrigeration system, storage tank, barge and CO2 carrier. Since there were several design alternatives in ship-based CCS chain with adjustable operating conditions, those options were suggested and evaluated for the optimization. Installation of one compressor or two was considered and fifteen refrigeration alternative processes were suggested. Four different sizes of the CO2 carrier were proposed to optimize the capacity of the CO2 carrier. The economic evaluation model was based on the LCC (Life Cycle Cost) methodology. The LCC was estimated for the design options with availability taken into account as well as the CAPEX (Capital Expenditure) and OPEX (Operation Expenditure). The CAPEX and OPEX were estimated after the design parameters were determined. The economic evaluation model was applied to the LCC estimation of two cases. The LCC results showed that the governing factor was OPEX, dominantly affected by the liquefaction system. The unavailability cost gave a significant impact on the estimated LCC so that the wrong conclusion could be drawn on the best method without considering the production availability. The results in the CO2 carrier demonstrated that the size of CO2 carrier should be defined after the economic evaluation because there was no effect of economies of scale. Â© 2012 IEEE.

TI  - Long-term temperature and sea-level rise stabilization before and beyond 2100: Estimating the additional climate mitigation contribution from China's recent 2060 carbon neutrality pledge
AB  - As the largest emitter in the world, China recently pledged to reach a carbon peak before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060, which could accelerate the progress of mitigating negative climate change effects. In this study, we used the Minimum Complexity Earth Simulator and a semi-empirical statistical model to quantify the global mean temperature and sea-level rise (SLR) response under a suite of emission pathways that are constructed to cover various carbon peak and carbon neutrality years in China. The results show that China will require a carbon emission reduction rate of no less than 6\%/year and a growth rate of more than 10\%/year for carbon capture capacity to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Carbon peak years and peak emissions contribute significantly to mitigating climate change in the near term, while carbon neutrality years are more influential in the long term. Mitigation due to recent China's pledge alone will contribute a 0.16 degrees C-0.21 degrees C avoided warming at 2100 and also lessen the cumulative warming above 1.5 degrees C level. When accompanied by coordinated international efforts to reach global carbon neutrality before 2070, the 2 degrees C target can be achieved. However, the 1.5 degrees C target requires additional efforts, such as global scale adoption of negative emission technology for CO2, as well as a deep cut in non-CO2 GHG emissions. Collectively, the efforts of adopting negative emission technolgy and curbing all greenhouse gas emissions will reduce global warming by 0.9 degrees C -1.2 degrees C at 2100, and also reduce SLR by 49-59 cm in 2200, compared to a baseline mitigation pathway already aiming at 2 degrees C. Our findings suggest that while China's ambitious carbon-neutral pledge contributes to Paris Agreement's targets, additional major efforts will be needed, such as reaching an earlier and lower CO2 emission peak, developing negative emission technology for CO2, and cutting other non-CO2 GHGs such as N2O, CH4, O-3, and HFCs.

TI  - Formation kinetics, mechanism of CO2 hydrate and its applications
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) hydrate technology has the potential applications to the fields of CO2 capture and storage, gas replacement in the exploitation of natural gas hydrates, seawater desalination and refrigeration. These applications can provide the alternative solutions to the problems presented in the fields of climate and energy. Therefore, this review detailly discusses the basic researches of CO2 hydrate nucleation and growth as well as the potential applications of CO2 hydrate technology. Firstly, CO2 hydrate nucleation and growth were analyzed in the absence of additives. The kinetics of CO2 hydrate formation is mainly affected by pressure, temperature and stirring speed, etc. Then, the effects of different additives on kinetics of CO2 hydrate formation are discussed due to the structural groups of additives, concentrations of additives and driving force. In addition, CO2 hydrate nucleation can be promoted or inhibited by the enhancement or disruption of local hydrogen-bonding network between water molecules. CO2 hydrate growth can be promoted or inhibited by accelerating or limiting CO2 molecules and water molecules to reach the growth site. Moreover, some kinetic models are constructed based on the basic theory and mechanism to describe the process of CO2 hydrate formation. Experimental studies and large-scale field tests illustrate that the industrial applications of CO2 hydrate technology are promising. More comprehensive and systematic studies including the further environmental impact and economic benefits still need to be done in the future.

TI  - United Kingdom: Yorkshire fields could capture 6% of UK emissions
AB  - According to Amec, the UK could reduce its CO2 emissions by over 6% by capturing and storing emissions from a handful of large industrial sites in the Yorkshire and Humber regions. Working on behalf of Yorkshire Forward, Amec has studied the infrastructure network needed to connect local industrial emitters to suitable CO2 storage sites in the North Sea. According to Amec's project director Alastair Rennie, this would cost around $3.95 billion, which would cover the infrastructure needed to compress and transport the gas, but not the cost of capturing the gas or the technology at the wellhead. The plan sees a number of companies developing the infrastructure in stages. The Yorkshire and Humber area is ideally suited as a first project of this kind, because it has both a relatively small number of large-scale CO2 emitters, including the Drax, Eggborough, and Ferrybridge, and a large number of mature gas fields nearby with a well-understood, stable geology, ideal for carbon storage. Many of these are expected to be depleted between 2012 and 2030. Amec's calculations assume that only 25% of the CO2 emitted in the area would ultimately be abated, that is the amount captured minus the emissions associated with the process of gas capture and transportation. Even so, the contribution would be very noticeable, amounting to around 35.6 million ton/yr by 2030, or 6.4% of the country's total CO2 emissions in 2005. At best, Rennie calculates that the Yorkshire and Humber region could abate 46.3 million ton/yr of carbon by 2040.

AB  - In this paper, we propose the framework of risk, assessment system, for CCS, carbon capture and storage, especially for enhanced recovery of gas, oil and gas hydrates. Based on the protocol proposed by US and European institutions, the framework of enhanced CCS has been modified to improve the functions of geological-based performance assessment. Some results on simulation of CO2 migration, and the estimation of the leakage of CO 2 in pathways are presented and discussed for the further development. In addition, the stimulation of gas hydrates using CO2 would be possible CCS methods at offshore area. The original method of CO 2-CH4 substitution in the production of gas hydrates is also introduced in the present study.

TI  - Carbon dioxide storage through mineral carbonation
AB  - Carbon capture and storage has a fundamental role in limiting anthropogenic warming to 1.5-2 degrees C. This Review discusses the basis, potential and limitations of in situ mineral carbonation as a carbon capture and storage strategy. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has a fundamental role in achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit anthropogenic warming to 1.5-2 degrees C. Most ongoing CCS projects inject CO2 into sedimentary basins and require an impermeable cap rock to prevent the CO2 from migrating to the surface. Alternatively, captured carbon can be stored through injection into reactive rocks (such as mafic or ultramafic lithologies), provoking CO2 mineralization and, thereby, permanently fixing carbon with negligible risk of return to the atmosphere. Although in situ mineralization offers a large potential volume for carbon storage in formations such as basalts and peridotites (both onshore and offshore), its large-scale implementation remains little explored beyond laboratory-based and field-based experiments. In this Review, we discuss the potential of mineral carbonation to address the global CCS challenge and contribute to long-term reductions in atmospheric CO2. Emphasis is placed on the advances in making this technology more cost-effective and in exploring the limits and global applicability of CO2 mineralization.

TI  - News: Great Britain: BP, ConocoPhillips, Shell and Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE) to design hydrogen power plant
AB  - The planned project - producing "decarbonized" fuel and using it for power generation - would convert natural gas to hydrogen and CO2 gases, then use the hydrogen gas as fuel for a 350 Mw power station, and export the CO2 to a North Sea oil reservoir for increased oil recovery and ultimate storage. The project would reduce the amount of CO2 emitted to the atmosphere by the power generation by over 90%. The full project would require total capital investment of some $600 million. When fully operational, the project would be expected to capture and store around 1.3 million ton of CO2/yr. The project would be located close to Peter-head in north-east Scotland.

TI  - Representing non-linear wave energy converters in coastal wave models
AB  - To meet the growing global demand for carbon neutral electricity, wave energy is increasingly being identified for its global prevalence and the emerging clean technologies that can harness it. To provide the scale of electricity needed, Wave Energy Converters (WECs) will need to be deployed in large arrays. However, the effects of a WEC array's layout on the surrounding wave conditions in both the near and far fields is poorly understood. The published literature describes numerous methods to model interactions of incident waves and WEC arrays. Yet, none of the published methods provide a methodology which spectrally resolves the individual WEC's energy conversion characteristics, and has the flexibility to be applied to any emerging WEC design. This study develops and implements two novel candidate high-fidelity representations of a Backwards Bent Duct Buoy Oscillating Water Column (BBDB) WEC within a Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) coastal model. Each candidate representation is developed by post-processing time series data generated from a time domain numerical simulation to form a meta-model, referred to as an obstacle case, consistent with the SWAN governing equations and discretization scheme. The study is executed within the framework of SNL-SWAN â€“ a modified version of SWAN that includes a WEC obstacle case that is built on the established concept of using SWAN's transmission coefficient to emulate the wave-WEC interactions. The two new WEC obstacle cases build on SNL-SWAN by considering the WEC's intercepted power, the rate of energy extraction from the waves, instead of the captured power, the rate of energy conversion by the power-take-off. The two new candidates differ in their level of spectral resolution: one homogenizes the intercepted power across the frequency domain while the other attempts to spectrally resolve the energy transfer mechanisms. The two new candidate obstacle cases were compared by considering up to 5 BBDB devices subject to irregular wave conditions. For an individual device, a region of significantly perturbed wave heights, referred to as a wake, stretched 200 m in the lee of the WEC, with the maximum impact on wave heights seen 50 m behind the device. The wake behind five devices is largely dependent on the device spacing. The five unit WEC array only presented decreases of wave height between 0.2 and 0.7 m 200 m behind the last device in the array. A five unit WEC array model showed that estimates of individual WEC power performance was reduced by 2.3% and 6.0% when implementing the two new obstacle cases. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Impacts of harmful algal blooms on marine aquaculture in a low-carbon future
AB  - The IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 Â°C highlights the potential for dietary shifts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from livestock. Reductions in the consumption of terrestrial animal protein require increases in the consumption of other food categories, to maintain food security, balanced dietary patterns, and protein intake. Aquaculture has long been suggested as one way to meet future food security needs, and marine and estuarine aquaculture in particular is associated with comparatively low greenhouse gas emissions. However, marine and freshwater aquaculture is affected by factors including harmful algal blooms (HABs), which have been increasingly documented around the world, correlated to increases in worldwide aquaculture. In this study, we applied a global multi-region input-output model to capture the direct effects as well as the indirect and induced effects HABs might pose to a global dietary transition from terrestrial livestock to increased seafood consumption from marine and estuarine aquaculture sources. We found that marine and estuarine aquaculture has a substantial potential to replace meat consumption from terrestrial livestock sources, as increases in CO2 emissions from aquaculture were more than offset by reductions in emissions from mainly cattle grazing and associated land clearing. HABs were found to have a minor monetary impact, but the impact on protein supply was found to be potentially sizeable. For example, in a future setting where 40% of terrestrial protein sources were replaced by aquaculture, a HAB-caused global loss of 5% would set in motion numerous supply-chain cascades, affecting industries auxiliary to aquaculture, indirectly and ultimately reducing protein intake by 10â€“20%. Such reductions have the potential for pushing parts of Sub-Saharan populations into protein-energy malnutrition. Nevertheless, there remains a significant potential for a dietary transition to increased aquaculture seafood to contribute to reductions in GHG. Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Novel shoreline cap for controlling sheen and dissolved-phase constituent discharge
AB  - A novel, multilayered shoreline cap was designed and installed to mitigate the release of petroleum light nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) and dissolved-phase groundwater constituents to the Willamette River in Portland, OR. Releases of LNAPL related to upland impacts caused occasional sheens on a portion of the river within the Portland Harbor Superfund Site. The frequency and volume of sheens decreased following the installation of an upland sheet pile barrier wall, but occasional sheens related to LNAPL impacts stranded downgradient of the wall continuedâ€“prompting the design of a shoreline remedy. Because the site is located within the Portland Harbor Superfund Site, the cap was designed to mitigate sheen and to meet the objectives specified in the Portland Harbor Record of Decision including limiting the discharge of certain dissolved-phase constituents of interest. The cap design was the first instance of combining an oleophilic bio-barrier to mitigate sheen and an activated carbon layer to capture dissolved-phase constituents.

TI  - Tomakomai CCS Demonstration Project of Japan, CO2 Injection in Progress
AB  - A large-scale CCS demonstration project is being undertaken by the Japanese government in the Tomakomai area, Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan. The objective is to demonstrate the viability of a full CCS system, from CO2 capture to injection and storage. One hundred thousand tonnes/year or more of CO2 is being injected and stored in offshore saline aquifers in the Tomakomai port area. The implementation of this project has been commissioned to Japan CCS Co., Ltd. (JCCS) by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) with the subsidies for the operating expenses by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI). The CO2 source is a pressure swing adsorption offgas from a hydrogen production unit (HPU) of an oil refinery located in the coastal area of Tomakomai Port. The HPU provides CO2 rich offgas to the Tomakomai demonstration project CO2 capture facility via a 1.4 km pipeline. In the capture facility, gaseous CO2 of 99\% or higher purity is recovered from the offgas by a commercially proven amine scrubbing process with a design capacity of 200,000 tonnes per year. At the injection facility, the gaseous CO2 is compressed and injected into two different offshore reservoirs (Moebetsu Formation/sandstone layers and Takinoue Formation/volcanic rocks layers) by two dedicated deviated injection wells. The storage points are located at 3 to 4 km offshore. The project is scheduled to run between the period of JFY 2012 -2020 (JFY is from April of calendar year to following March). The injection of CO2 began in April 2016. The injection of CO2 will be conducted for three years and monitoring for five years. The injection target is 300,000 tonnes in total over three years. The main features of this project are: 1) Extensive monitoring system in seismically active country, 2) Deviated CO2 injection wells drilled from onshore to offshore, 3) Marine environmental survey by domestic law reflecting London Protocol, 4) Low energy CO2 capture process, 5) Injection of CO2 near urban area.

AB  - Offshore gravimetric monitoring has been introduced as a complement to seismic monitoring of fields with moving fluids. The Sleipner field in the North Sea is a fully operational carbon capture and storage facility, where CO2 is injected for storage. Gravimetric measurements are one of the geophysical monitoring methods applied, and the data have been used to estimate the in situ density and dissolution of the CO2. We defined a Bayesian inversion of gravimetric data, and we used this to analyze gravimetric data at Sleipner field. In our approach, we included spatial uncertainty in the model and performed a Bayesian analysis of the in situ CO2 density and dissolution. We also analyzed the impact of mass changes due to gas production from the Ty Formation. Our estimates were comparable with published results.

TI  - Systematic Framework for CO2 Transport Design of CCS System in the Archipelagic State
AB  - In the carbon capture and storage system, carbon dioxide transport plays an essential role in connecting the source and sink points. A series of design stages should be developed to obtain a feasible transport design from an economic perspective. This paper presents a systematic framework for feasible CO2 transport design. The framework combines various methods and procedures in an integrated manner. The framework consists of two stages. The first stage involves task and system boundary identification, design, and evaluation of the carbon capture and storage (CCS) network. Three design schemes with overall, regional, and pseudo-regional approaches are used to generate the CCS network. The second stage involves designing CO2 transport in a CCS network with different transport technologies and evaluating all identified transport designs in terms of technical feasibility and economics. Two transport design scenarios are used in this stage, standalone design and shared facilities design. The framework is implemented for the CCS system candidate in the central and eastern parts of Indonesia. The specific cost is used to select the most effective transport designs. The results show that the framework is applicable for the CCS system with many sources and sinks separated in different regions. In such cases, offshore pipelines are not feasible to be applied because the CO2 transport volume is relatively small and the high-pressure drop. The most effective transport design can be achieved by the regional scheme in which CO2 transport is restricted only in the same regions.

TI  - Capture process turns CO2 into construction materials
AB  - An MIT engineer is developing a process that would not only remove carbon dioxide from the environment, but also turn it into solid carbonates that could be used in construction. By genetically engineering ordinary baker's yeast, Belcher and two of her graduate students, Roberto Barbero and Elizabeth Wood, have created a process that can produce about two pounds of carbonate for every pound of carbon dioxide captured. To create the yeast-powered process, Belcher drew inspiration from marine animals that build their own rock-solid shells from carbon dioxide and mineral ions dissolved in seawater. Some companies have corn mercialized processes that capture carbon dioxide and convert it to solid material, but those efforts rely on a chemical process to capture carbon dioxide. The MIT team's biological system captures carbon dioxide at a higher rate, said Barbero. Another advantage of the biological system is that it requires no heating or cooling and no toxic chemicals.

TI  - Neutronic investigation of alternative \& composite burnable poisons for the soluble-boron-free and long life civil marine small modular reactor cores
AB  - Concerns about the effects of global warming provide a strong case to consider how best nuclear power could be applied to marine propulsion. Currently, there are persistent efforts worldwide to combat global warming, and that also includes the commercial freight shipping sector. In an effort to decarbonize the marine sector, there are growing interests in replacing the contemporary, traditional propulsion systems with nuclear propulsion systems. The latter system allows freight ships to have longer intervals before refueling; subsequently, lower fuel costs, and minimal carbon emissions. Nonetheless, nuclear propulsion systems have remained largely confined to military vessels. It is highly desirable that a civil marine core not use soluble boron for reactivity control, but it is then a challenge to achieve an adequate shutdown margin throughout the core life while maintaining reactivity control and acceptable power distributions in the core. High-thickness ZrB2 150 mu m Integral Fuel Burnable Absorber (IFBA) is an excellent burnable poison (BP) candidate for long life soluble-boron-free core. However, in this study, we want to minimize the use of 150 mu m IFBA since B-10 undergoes an (n, alpha) capture reaction, and the resulting helium raises the pressure within the plenum and in the cladding. Therefore, we have considered several alternative and novel burnable BP design strategies to minimize the use of IFBA for reactivity control in this study: (Case 1) a composite BP: gadolinia (Gd2O3) or erbia (Er2O3) with 150 mu m thickness ZrB2 IFBA; (Case 2) Pu-240 or Am-241 mixed homogeneously with the fuel; and (Case 3) another composite BP: Pu-240 or Am-241 with 150 mu m thickness ZrB2 IFBA. The results are compared against those for a high-thickness 150 mu m 25 IFBA pins design from a previous study. The high-thickness 150 mu m 25 IFBA pins design is termed the ``IFBA-only{''} BP design throughout this study. We arrive at a design using 15\% U-235 fuel loaded into 13 x 13 assemblies with Case 3 BPs (IFBA+Pu-240 or IFBA+Am-241) for reactivity control while reducing 20\% IFBA use. This design exhibits lower assembly reactivity swing and minimal burnup penalty due to the self-shielding effect. Case 3 provides similar to 10\% more initial (beginning-of-life) reactivity suppression with similar to 70\% less reactivity swing compared to the IFBA-only design for UO2 fuel while achieving almost the same core lifetime. Finally, optimized Case 3 assemblies were loaded in 3D nodal diffusion and reactor model code. The results obtained from the 3D reactor model confirmed that the designed core with the proposed Case 3 BPs can achieve the target lifetime of 15 years while contributing to similar to 10\% higher BOL reactivity suppression, similar to 70\% lower reactivity swings, similar to 30\% lower radial form factor and similar to 28\% lower total peaking factor compared to the IFBA-only core.

TI  - Controlling evaporation of liquid CO2during transport as part of CCS
AB  - In Europe, deployment of large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) with storage in an underground geological formation will in practice imply off-shore storage. This implies separation, purification and liquefaction of CO2and, after transport to a harbour facility, loading into a ship for transport to the storage site, a trip that may take several days. The topic of this paper is how to address the evaporation of some of the liquefied CO2caused by heat leaking into the storage, resulting in rising pressure and temperature that should be controlled. First, this paper will assess the dependence of liquefied CO2evaporation with time (boil-off rate, BOR) on starting (low, medium or high) pressures/temperatures and heat ingress, and the rate of pressure and temperature increase as a result of it. Secondly, it will suggest alternatives to re-liquefaction during the transport. The latter could involve, for example, the use of zeolite or other sorbent, or adding small amounts of a component with slightly different thermodynamic properties to the CO2. As the first part of the paper shows, based on the behaviour of pure CO2there may not be a need for worries or action since the pressure rise is very modest even after several days. The work also shows that small amounts of impurities may have significant effects, emphasising the importance of pre-transport processing. Â© ECOS 2020.All right reserved.

TI  - Monitoring techniques using autonomous underwater vehicles for potential seepage of CO2 from sub-seafloor storage sites
AB  - Although a number of Carbon Capture and Storage sub-seafloor storage sites are now either in operation or planned for CO2, little is known about the effect of potential seepage on marine ecosystems. Here we describe a comprehensive field campaign to the North Sea (RRS James Cook Cruise 77) that used Autosub 6000 to test methods for detection of seepage, including formation fluids, natural gas and CO2, as it passes through the sedimentary overburden and into the water column, and develop monitoring strategies suitable for all offshore carbon capture and storage projects. In this paper we describe the Hugin Fracture, a 2 km long discontinuity imaged on the seabed, and associated fluid flow activity, revealed by geophysical observations including high reflectivity acoustic anomalies within the overburden. Further results in favour of active fluid flow along this fault will be presented, using a combination of multidisciplinary datasets comprising video photography, Eh sensor and sediment samples.

TI  - Northwest Java and East Natuna Field: Perspective to apply carbon capture and storage (CCS) in Indonesia
AB  - Climate change is becoming most issue discussed in the world since last decade that is believed to occur by the emission of anthropogenic greenhouse-gases in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide emissions are responsible for the most important greenhouse-gas effects. Therefore developed and developing countries attempt to reduce the CO 2 emissions in further decades. Indonesia, as a member of the Kyoto Protocol, plans to reduce CO 2 emissions to 26% in 2020. Carbon capture storage (CCS) is one of the technologies to reduce emission and enhanced hydrocarbon recovery. The comprehensive study concerning the technology and application of CCS has been begun in other countries as well as in Indonesia now. Therefore, The Department of Petroleum Engineering of ITB conducts a study concerning the feasibility of CCS application in the petroleum industry. The main purpose of the study is to provide knowledge of CCS system, the effects of impurities on storage operations, and finally the principal storage possibilities in two fields Indonesia, Northwest Java Field and East Natuna. The Northwest Java Field is a back-arc field which consists of many reservoirs-such as Talangakar Formation sandstones, a carbonate reef of Baturaja Formation, carbonate of Upper Cibulakan Formation, and carbonates of Parigi Formation. The most promising formation in Northwest Java field is the Parigi formation.East Natuna Field has similar characteristics with North Java Field, therefore might be suitable also for CO 2 injection storage. The research in this paper discussed about feasibility of carbonate formations as CO 2 storage. A brief explanation of the geological setting and comparison with other carbonate CO 2 storage is also presented. Hopefully, this study will encourage the CCS research and development in Indonesia further. Copyright 2012, Carbon Management Technology Conference.

TI  - Technical and environmental viability of a European CO2 EOR system
AB  - Captured CO2 from large industrial emitters may be used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), but as of yet there are no European large-scale EOR systems. Recent implementation decisions for a Norwegian carbon capture and storage demonstration will result in the establishment of a central CO2 hub on the west-coast of Norway and storage on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. This development may continue towards a large-scale operation involving European CO2 and CO2 EOR operation. To this end, a conceptual EOR system was developed here based on an oxyfuel power plant located in Poland that acted as a source for CO2, coupled to a promising oil field located on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Lifecycle assessment was subsequently used to estimate environmental emissions indicators. When averaged over the operational lifetime, results show greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 0.4 kg CO2-eq per kg oil (and n kWh associated electricity) produced, of which 64 \% derived from the oxyfuel power plant. This represents a 71 \% emission reduction when compared to the same amount of oil and electricity production using conventional technology. Other environmental impact indicators were increased, showing that this type of CO2 EOR system may help reach GHG reduction targets, but care should be taken to avoid problem shifting.

TI  - Systematic Framework for CO2 Transport Design of CCS System in the Archipelagic State
AB  - In the carbon capture and storage system, carbon dioxide transport plays an essential role in connecting the source and sink points. A series of design stages should be developed to obtain a feasible transport design from an economic perspective. This paper presents a systematic framework for feasible CO2 transport design. The framework combines various methods and procedures in an integrated manner. The framework consists of two stages. The first stage involves task and system boundary identification, design, and evaluation of the carbon capture and storage (CCS) network. Three design schemes with overall, regional, and pseudo-regional approaches are used to generate the CCS network. The second stage involves designing CO2 transport in a CCS network with different transport technologies and evaluating all identified transport designs in terms of technical feasibility and economics. Two transport design scenarios are used in this stage, standalone design and shared facilities design. The framework is implemented for the CCS system candidate in the central and eastern parts of Indonesia. The specific cost is used to select the most effective transport designs. The results show that the framework is applicable for the CCS system with many sources and sinks separated in different regions. In such cases, offshore pipelines are not feasible to be applied because the CO2 transport volume is relatively small and the high-pressure drop. The most effective transport design can be achieved by the regional scheme in which CO2 transport is restricted only in the same regions.

TI  - Design and engineering implementation of blowdown system for cryogenic CO2- NG pilot facility
AB  - As easy gas resources around the world are depleting; high Carbon Dioxide (CO2) gas fields are thrust into the spotlight to become new candidates for field development. However, the presence of oftentimes sizable Carbon Dioxide contents in the gas reservoir (can be up to 80% volumetric) introduced a huge technical and economic challenges towards the field exploitation. Over the last few years, several studies have been conducted on cryogenic technologies such as cryogenic distillation and supersonic nozzle in CO2 separation for fields containing more than 40% of CO2. Based on the studies, these new cryogenic technologies have shown to have high potential in separating CO2 from natural gas offshore to be utilized under carbon, capture, storage and utilization (CCUS) project. The new cryogenic technologies are currently being tested for the proof of concept. Hence, a pilot plant, which is a scaled down version of the technology was developed. One of the major challenges faced during the pilot plant testing is the emergency depressurization philosophy as the process involves CO2 solids handling which is uncommon to the industry standard. Depressurization of high CO2 fluid at cryogenic temperature would lead to possibility of CO2 solids formation, hence potential blockage of process equipment and venting line. Therefore, this paper will focus on the design of the pressure relieving system of such a facilities. It would also touched on the implementation of the pressure relieving system during the operation of the pilot tests and as well as the tests designed specially to test the pressure relieving system. Finally the paper would give a few proposals on improvements to be made to such system. It is also the ultimate aim of the authors and the team to introduce a new philosophy for Cryogenic CO2 Blowdown system to the process industry. Copyright 2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - Stimulation applications for carbonate reservoirs: An overview of acidizing technologies and methods used in pre and post salt reservoirs in Brazil
AB  - Pre and post salt carbonate reservoirs are becoming the main source of hydrocarbon production in Brazil. One of the reasons behind this success is the development of many fields located on pre salt areas along the Brazilian shore. Production optimization is vital for sustainability, which requires efficient methods and technology to stimulate these reservoirs. The main cost-effective approach used in Brazil to improve the production in carbonate reservoir areas is matrix acidizing. Stimulation fluids are pumped into the formation below the fracture pressure to create wormholes that can bypass near wellbore damage and increase the drainage radius along the wellbore. This study offers an insight of the most common methods and technology used to perform matrix acidizing on offshore carbonate reservoirs in Brazil. The main aspects of the study are fluids selection, pumping strategies, completion design and pressure behavior analysis. Before 2012, most of the offshore stimulation operations in Brazil were performed on sandstone reservoirs. With the advent of pre salt development this scenario changes drastically leading to a high volume of matrix acidizing on carbonate reservoirs in both post and pre salt zones. The main challenges to designing and executing matrix acidizing on carbonate reservoirs in Brazil are the long reservoir intervals combined with high permeability contrasts, high formation temperature and the need of large fluid capacity to accommodate the required treatment designs. Additionally, super duplex stainless steel metallurgies must be considered for corrosion inhibition protection. To overcome these challenges: first, a proper fluid diversion technique must be employed to distribute the treatment fluid across all targeted zones; next, a proper fluid selection must be made to avoid carbonate face dissolution; and finally, corrosion protection is required for the well bore completion components from the corrosion rates increased by the high temperatures downhole. The lessons learned and best practices captured over the past decade on more than 250 offshore carbonate matrix acidizing operations has led to much success in the post and pre salt zones of Brazil.

TI  - The sleipner CO2 4D story: Fifteen years of CO2 storage and seismic monitoring
AB  - In 1996, Statoil and its partners began injecting approximately one million tonnes of CO2 per year into a sand-rich saline aquifer that lies some 800-1100 m beneath sea surface at the Sleipner Ost Field, in the Norwegian North Sea. In order to ensure caprock integrity and to evaluate subsurface CO2 plume development, seven time-lapse (4D) seismic surveys have been acquired at regular intervals since the original pre-injection survey of 1994 vintage. These were collected in 1999, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010, and reveal in detail the temporal development of the CO2 plume as it has been migrating away from the injection well. The plume manifests itself very conspicuously on seismic data, due to the higher compressibility and lower density of the injected CO2, relative to the ambient, connate, pore filling waters. By 2008, after 10.2 million tonnes of CO2 had been injected, there were no indications of leakage into the overburden, the plume had extended to a maximum of 2,775 m away from the injection point, had a long axis of 4,260 m, and had an areal coverage of 3.1 sq km. Continued seismic monitoring of this industry leading project has given validity to the carbon capture and storage (CCS) concept.

TI  - Pipeline reuse: A unique opportunity for the UK
AB  - Various aspects of reusing of gas pipelines in United Kingdom are discussed. The reuse is technically feasible and possibly economically viable for the transportation of carbon dioxide, hydrogen and for the transportation of gas produced from underground gasification. There are many laws and regulations governing the use of most structures related to energy production and few consider carbon capture or reuse of facilities and the matter related to decommissioning of offshore structure is covered by the Petroleum Act, 1998 and London Convention. The legislation governing the decommissioning of pipelines is far reaching in its effect and section 34 of Part IV of the Petroleum Act underlines the principle that the taxpayer will not pick-up the costs of cleaning-up after the oil industry. The Department of Trade & Industry (DTI) will look to current owners of the pipelines to satisfy their legal obligations and require them to submit and fulfill a decommissioning program.
