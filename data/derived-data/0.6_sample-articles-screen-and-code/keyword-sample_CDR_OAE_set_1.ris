TI  - Direct electrolytic dissolution of silicate minerals for air CO2 mitigation and carbon-negative H2 production
AB  - We experimentally demonstrate the direct coupling of silicate mineral dissolution with saline water electrolysis and H2 production to effect significant air CO2 absorption, chemical conversion, and storage in solution. In particular, we observed as much as a 105-fold increase in OH-concentration (pH increase of up to 5.3 units) relative to experimental controls following the electrolysis of 0.25 M Na2SO4 solutions when the anode was encased in powdered silicate mineral, either wollastonite or an ultramafic mineral. After electrolysis, full equilibration of the alkalized solution with air led to a significant pH reduction and as much as a 45-fold increase in dissolved inorganic carbon concentration. This demonstrated significant spontaneous air CO2 capture, chemical conversion, and storage as a bicarbonate, predominantly as NaHCO3. The excess OH-initially formed in these experiments apparently resulted via neutralization of the anolyte acid, H2SO4, by reaction with the base mineral silicate at the anode, producing mineral sulfate and silica. This allowed the NaOH, normally generated at the cathode, to go unneutralized and to accumulate in the bulk electrolyte, ultimately reacting with atmospheric CO2 to form dissolved bicarbonate. Using nongrid or nonpeak renewable electricity, optimized systems at large scale might allow relatively high-capacity, energy-efficient (&lt;300 kJ/mol of CO2 captured), and inexpensive (&lt;$100 per tonne of CO2 mitigated) removal of excess air CO2 with production of carbon-negative H2. Furthermore, when added to the ocean, the produced hydroxide and/or (bi)carbonate could be useful in reducing sea-to-air CO2 emissions and in neutralizing or offsetting the effects of ongoing ocean acidification.

TI  - Quantifying and Comparing Effects of Climate Engineering Methods on the Earth System
AB  - To contribute to a quantitative comparison of climate engineering (CE) methods, we assess atmosphere-, ocean-, and land-based CE measures with respect to Earth system effects consistently within one comprehensive model. We use the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) with prognostic carbon cycle to compare solar radiation management (SRM) by stratospheric sulfur injection and two carbon dioxide removal methods: afforestation and ocean alkalinization. The CE model experiments are designed to offset the effect of fossil-fuel burning on global mean surface air temperature under the RCP8.5 scenario to follow or get closer to the RCP4.5 scenario. Our results show the importance of feedbacks in the CE effects. For example, as a response to SRM the land carbon uptake is enhanced by 92Gt by the year 2100 compared to the reference RCP8.5 scenario due to reduced soil respiration thus reducing atmospheric CO2. Furthermore, we show that normalizations allow for a better comparability of different CE methods. For example, we find that due to compensating processes such as biogeophysical effects of afforestation more carbon needs to be removed from the atmosphere by afforestation than by alkalinization to reach the same global warming reduction. Overall, we illustrate how different CE methods affect the components of the Earth system; we identify challenges arising in a CE comparison, and thereby contribute to developing a framework for a comparative assessment of CE.

TI  - Ocean Deacidification Technologies for Marine Aquaculture
AB  - The increase in partial pressure of CO2 in the oceans directly affects the productivity and survival of coastal industries and ecosystems. For marine aquaculture, the decreased alkalinity of seawater results in reduced availability of carbonates for marine organisms to build their shells, leading to decreased aquaculture quality and productivity. The industry has been implementing recirculating aquaculture systems (RASs) to reduce CO2 in feedwaters, but recent interest in ocean-based CO2 capture has led to additional strategies that may be relevant. The new methods in addition to CO2 removal offer capture options for enhanced aquaculture sustainability. Here, we review and compare early-stage and commercially available technologies for deacidification of seawater and their suitability for aquaculture. Most methods considered rely on a voltage-induced pH swing to shift the carbonate/bicarbonate equilibrium toward the release of CO2, with subsequent capture of the released CO2 as a gas or as solid mineral carbonates. The modular design and distributed deployment potential of these systems offers promise, but current demonstrations are limited to bench scale, highlighting the need for sustained research and development before they can be implemented for marine aquaculture.

TI  - CO2 Ocean Bistability on Terrestrial Exoplanets
AB  - Cycling of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and interior of rocky planets can stabilize global climate and enable planetary surface temperatures above freezing over geologic time. However, variations in global carbon budget and unstable feedback cycles between planetary sub-systems may destabilize the climate of rocky exoplanets toward regimes unknown in the Solar System. Here, we perform clear-sky atmospheric radiative transfer and surface weathering simulations to probe the stability of climate equilibria for rocky, ocean-bearing exoplanets at instellations relevant for planetary systems in the outer regions of the circumstellar habitable zone. Our simulations suggest that planets orbiting G- and F-type stars (but not M-type stars) may display bistability between an Earth-like climate state with efficient carbon sequestration and an alternative stable climate equilibrium where CO2 condenses at the surface and forms a blanket of either clathrate hydrate or liquid CO2. At increasing instellation and with ineffective weathering, the latter state oscillates between cool, surface CO2-condensing and hot, non-condensing climates. CO2 bistable climates may emerge early in planetary history and remain stable for billions of years. The carbon dioxide-condensing climates follow an opposite trend in pCO(2) versus instellation compared to the weathering-stabilized planet population, suggesting the possibility of observational discrimination between these distinct climate categories.

TI  - Olivine Dissolution in Seawater: Implications for CO2 Sequestration through Enhanced Weathering in Coastal Environments
AB  - Enhanced weathering of (ultra)basic silicate rocks such as olivine-rich dunite has been proposed as a large-scale climate engineering approach. When implemented in coastal environments, olivine weathering is expected to increase seawater alkalinity, thus resulting in additional CO2 uptake from the atmosphere. However, the mechanisms of marine olivine weathering and its effect on seawater-carbonate chemistry remain poorly understood. Here, we present results from batch reaction experiments, in which forsteritic olivine was subjected to rotational agitation in different seawater media for periods of days to months. Olivine dissolution caused a significant increase in alkalinity of the seawater with a consequent DIC increase due to CO2 invasion, thus confirming viability of the basic concept of enhanced silicate weathering. However, our experiments also identified several important challenges with respect to the detailed quantification of the CO2 sequestration efficiency under field conditions, which include nonstoichiometric dissolution, potential pore water saturation in the seabed, and the potential occurrence of secondary reactions. Before enhanced weathering of olivine in coastal environments can be considered an option for realizing negative CO2 emissions for climate mitigation purposes, these aspects need further experimental assessment.

TI  - Eco-engineering approaches for ocean negative carbon emission
AB  - The goal of achieving carbon neutrality in the next 30â€“40 years is approaching worldwide consensus and requires coordinated efforts to combat the increasing threat of climate change. Two main sets of actions have been proposed to address this grand goal. One is to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere, and the other is to increase carbon sinks or negative emissions, i.e., removing CO2 from the atmosphere. Here we advocate eco-engineering approaches for ocean negative carbon emission (ONCE), aiming to enhance carbon sinks in the marine environment. An international program is being established to promote coordinated efforts in developing ONCE-relevant strategies and methodologies, taking into consideration ecological/biogeochemical processes and mechanisms related to different forms of carbon (inorganic/organic, biotic/abiotic, particulate/dissolved) for sequestration. We focus on marine ecosystem-based approaches and pay special attention to mechanisms that require transformative research, including those elucidating interactions between the biological pump (BP), the microbial carbon pump (MCP), and microbially induced carbonate precipitation (MICP). Eutrophic estuaries, hypoxic and anoxic waters, coral reef ecosystems, as well as aquaculture areas are particularly considered in the context of efforts to increase their capacity as carbon sinks. ONCE approaches are thus expected to be beneficial for both carbon sequestration and alleviation of environmental stresses. Â© 2022

TI  - Potential impacts of effluent from accelerated weathering of limestone on seawater carbon chemistry: A case study for the Hoping power plant in northeastern Taiwan
AB  - The Hoping power plant (HPP), located on the northeastern coast of Taiwan, is considered an ideal site to test the accelerated weathering of limestone (AWL) technique for fossil fuel CO2 mitigation because the required reactants, seawater and limestone, are readily available and inexpensive to obtain. In this study, we investigated the current status of chemical hydrography at two off-shore stations near the HPP, the results of which can provide a baseline for future evaluations of marine environmental changes arising from the potential implementation of AWL Additionally, seawater samples collected around the HPP were used to evaluate the effectiveness of CO2 absorption for the One-step and the Two-step AWL reactors, which were designed by the Industrial Technology Research Institute of Taiwan. The results demonstrate that the Two-step reactor is more effective than the One-step reactor in terms of CaCO3(s) dissolution, thus implying conversion of more dissolved CO2 into HCO3- balanced by Ca2+, which is environmentally benign and can be stored for the long-term in the ocean. The capacity of CO2(g) absorption for the current Two-step reactor was estimated to be 121 mu mol kg(-1). However, more efficient conversion of CO2 to ocean alkalinity using this method is possible with optimizing reactor designs and operating procedures. The impacts of the AWL effluent solution on pH and carbonate saturation state (Omega) in the receiving seawater were further examined by conducting a simple mixing simulation. The simulated result indicates that a 10-fold dilution would be sufficient to maintain the pH and Omega changes within a range of 0.2 and 0.8, respectively, which are regarded as constraints for safely discharging wastewater into the ocean.

TI  - Defining a biogeochemical baseline for sediments at Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) sites: An example from the North Sea (Goldeneye)
AB  - Injection of carbon dioxide (CO2) into subseafloor reservoirs is gaining traction as a strategy for mitigating anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Yet, potential leakage, migration and dissolution of externally-supplied CO2 from such reservoirs are a cause for concern. The potential impact of CO2 leakage on the biogeochemistry of sediments and overlying waters in the North Sea was studied during a controlled subsurface CO2 release experiment in 2019 at a potential carbon capture and storage site (Goldeneye). This study describes the natural (unperturbed) biogeochemistry of sediments. They are classified as muddy sand to sandy mud with low organic carbon content (âˆ¼0.6 %). Distributions of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA) in sediment porewaters are reported in addition to in situ benthic fluxes of dissolved nutrients and oxygen between the sediments and the overlying water. Oxygen fluxes into the sediment, measured using benthic chambers and eddy covariance, were 6.18 Â± 0.58 and 5.73 Â± 2.03 mmol mâˆ’2 d-1, respectively. Diagnostic indicators are discussed that could be used to detect CO2 enrichment of sediments due to reservoir leakage at CCS sites. These include the ratio TA and ammonium to sulfate in sediment porewaters, benthic fluxes and chloride-normalized cation distributions. These indicators currently suggest that the organic carbon at Goldeneye has an oxidation state below zero and is mainly degraded via sulfate reduction. Carbonate precipitation is apparently negligible, whereas decreases in Mg2+ and K+ point toward ongoing alteration of lithogenic sediments by reverse weathering processes. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Microbial ecosystem responses to alkalinity enhancement in the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre
AB  - In addition to reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, actively removing CO2 from the atmosphere is widely considered necessary to keep global warming well below 2Â°C. Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) describes a suite of such CO2 removal processes that all involve enhancing the buffering capacity of seawater. In theory, OAE both stores carbon and offsets ocean acidification. In practice, the response of the marine biogeochemical system to OAE must be demonstrably negligible, or at least manageable, before it can be deployed at scale. We tested the OAE response of two natural seawater mixed layer microbial communities in the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre, one at the Western gyre boundary, and one in the middle of the gyre. We conducted 4-day microcosm incubation experiments at sea, spiked with three increasing amounts of alkaline sodium salts and a 13C-bicarbonate tracer at constant pCO2. We then measured a suite of dissolved and particulate parameters to constrain the chemical and biological response to these additions. Microbial communities demonstrated occasionally measurable, but mostly negligible, responses to alkalinity enhancement. Neither site showed a significant increase in biologically produced CaCO3, even at extreme alkalinity loadings of +2,000 Î¼mol kgâˆ’1. At the gyre boundary, alkalinity enhancement did not significantly impact net primary production rates. In contrast, net primary production in the central gyre decreased by ~30% in response to alkalinity enhancement. The central gyre incubations demonstrated a shift toward smaller particle size classes, suggesting that OAE may impact community composition and/or aggregation/disaggregation processes. In terms of chemical effects, we identify equilibration of seawater pCO2, inorganic CaCO3 precipitation, and immediate effects during mixing of alkaline solutions with seawater, as important considerations for developing experimental OAE methodologies, and for practical OAE deployment. These initial results underscore the importance of performing more studies of OAE in diverse marine environments, and the need to investigate the coupling between OAE, inorganic processes, and microbial community composition.

TI  - Geochemical Negative Emissions Technologies: Part I. Review
AB  - Over the previous two decades, a diverse array of geochemical negative emissions technologies (NETs) have been proposed, which use alkaline minerals for removing and permanently storing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Geochemical NETs include CO2 mineralization (methods which react alkaline minerals with CO2, producing solid carbonate minerals), enhanced weathering (dispersing alkaline minerals in the environment for CO2 drawdown) and ocean alkalinity enhancement (manipulation of ocean chemistry to remove CO2 from air as dissolved inorganic carbon). CO2 mineralization approaches include in situ (CO2 reacts with alkaline minerals in the Earth's subsurface), surficial (high surface area alkaline minerals found at the Earth's surface are reacted with air or CO2-bearing fluids), and ex situ (high surface area alkaline minerals are transported to sites of concentrated CO2 production). Geochemical NETS may also include an approach to direct air capture (DAC) that harnesses surficial mineralization reactions to remove CO2 from air, and produce concentrated CO2. Overall, these technologies are at an early stage of development with just a few subjected to field trials. In Part I of this work we have reviewed the current state of geochemical NETs, highlighting key features (mineral resources; processes; kinetics; storage durability; synergies with other NETs such as DAC, risks; limitations; co-benefits, environmental impacts and life-cycle assessment). The role of organisms and biological mechanisms in enhancing geochemical NETs is also explored. In Part II, a roadmap is presented to help catalyze the research, development, and deployment of geochemical NETs at the gigaton scale over the coming decades.

TI  - The role of forest trees and their mycorrhizal fungi in carbonate rock weathering and its significance for global carbon cycling
AB  - On million-year timescales, carbonate rock weathering exerts no net effect on atmospheric CO2 concentration. However, on timescales of decades-to-centuries, it can contribute to sequestration of anthropogenic CO2 and increase land-ocean alkalinity flux, counteracting ocean acidification. Historical evidence indicates this flux is sensitive to land use change, and recent experimental evidence suggests that trees and their associated soil microbial communities are major drivers of continental mineral weathering. Here, we review key physical and chemical mechanisms by which the symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi of forest tree roots potentially enhance carbonate rock weathering. Evidence from our ongoing field study at the UK's national pinetum confirms increased weathering of carbonate rocks by a wide range of gymnosperm and angiosperm tree species that form arbuscular (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal partnerships. We demonstrate that calcite-containing rock grains under EM tree species weather significantly faster than those under AM trees, an effect linked to greater soil acidification by EM trees. Weathering and corresponding alkalinity export are likely to increase with rising atmospheric CO2 and associated climate change. Our analyses suggest that strategic planting of fast-growing EM angiosperm taxa on calcite- and dolomite-rich terrain might accelerate the transient sink for atmospheric CO2 and slow rates of ocean acidification. Carbonate mineral weathering in forest soils could act as a transient sink for anthropogenic CO (2) over human timescales of decades to centuries. Our manuscript reviews key physical and chemical mechanisms of carbonate weathering by mycorrhizal fungi of forest tree roots. We also present results of an ongoing field study at the UK's National Pinetum that demonstrates enhanced carbonate weathering by a range of tree species, particularly by ectomycorrhizal species.

TI  - Potential impact of CO2 emissions on the seafloor
AB  - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) aims to capture CO2 from fossil-fuel sources, transport and store it in suitable geological formations where it will be confined for extremely prolonged times. This is considered a feasible way of mitigating global warming. The seafloor is one of the target areas to safely store large volumes of anthropogenic CO2 through the development of sub-seabed CO2 geological storage. For the UK and large parts of Europe, the North Sea is potentially the most suitable location for CCS projects required to achieve planned targets in the reduction of CO2 emission. Other sub-seabed areas are studied for their storage potential in America and Asia. Even if the technology is considered proven, following the experience gained from the oil industry in using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and a few CO2 storage pilot projects, the risk of CO2 seepage must be addressed considering potential consequences on the marine environment. CO2 emissions may affect the seafloor with physical (e.g. sediments displacement), chemical (e.g. acidification) and biological (e.g. toxicity) effects. Laboratory experiments and the study of natural submarine CO2 vents are contributing to the development of a solid body of knowledge on these effects. The research is largely multidisciplinary, requiring expertise in natural sciences, engineering, chemistry and physics. The main observed consequences of CO2 emissions are a quick and strong acidification of the environment which may lead to the mobilization of pollutants, such as heavy metals, within the sedimentary cover of the seafloor diffusing within the overlying water column. Increased weathering of calcareous substrata is also likely following exposure to CO2- enriched fluids. Potential impacts upon local biodiversity would include displaced dissolved oxygen leading to anoxic regions, and localised ocean acidification. Consequences of increased CO2 would be a reduction in local seawater pH, and in the availability of carbonate ions required by calcifying organisms to grow. Predicted CO2 levels from potential seeps would lead to dissolution of exposed calcium carbonate shells and skeletons of local organisms. While some species would be able to tolerate and survive in such situations, others would die or suffer reduced growth rates. This is particularly pertinent for sessile benthic organisms which could not migrate following the onset of seepage. Naturally occurring submarine CO2 vents located along active tectonic and volcanic areas provide a good example of how organism communities change depending on their proximity to released CO2. For example, coral survival and growth decreases the closer they are to the CO2 vents, with macroalgae dominating the habitat instead. The timing and duration of potential industrial CO2 seeps would preclude the possibility of organism genetic adaptation over successive generations, and as such, possible impacts would depend upon organism acclimation potential and resilience. This chapter reviews the physical, chemical and biological implications of subseabed storage of CO2, and the consequences of potential seep events. Â© 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

TI  - Alkalinization Scenarios in the Mediterranean Sea for Efficient Removal of Atmospheric CO2 and the Mitigation of Ocean Acidification
AB  - It is now widely recognized that in order to reach the target of limiting global warming to well below 2Â°C above pre-industrial levels (as the objective of the Paris agreement), cutting the carbon emissions even at an unprecedented pace will not be sufficient, but there is the need for development and implementation of active Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) strategies. Among the CDR strategies that currently exist, relatively few studies have assessed the mitigation capacity of ocean-based Negative Emission Technologies (NET) and the feasibility of their implementation on a larger scale to support efficient implementation strategies of CDR. This study investigates the case of ocean alkalinization, which has the additional potential of contrasting the ongoing acidification resulting from increased uptake of atmospheric CO2 by the seas. More specifically, we present an analysis of marine alkalinization applied to the Mediterranean Sea taking into consideration the regional characteristics of the basin. Rather than using idealized spatially homogenous scenarios of alkalinization as done in previous studies, which are practically hard to implement, we use a set of numerical simulations of alkalinization based on current shipping routes to quantitatively assess the alkalinization efficiency via a coupled physical-biogeochemical model (NEMO-BFM) for the Mediterranean Sea at 1/16Â° horizontal resolution (~6 km) under an RCP4.5 scenario over the next decades. Simulations suggest the potential of nearly doubling the carbon-dioxide uptake rate of the Mediterranean Sea after 30 years of alkalinization, and of neutralizing the mean surface acidification trend of the baseline scenario without alkalinization over the same time span. These levels are achieved via two different alkalinization strategies that are technically feasible using the current network of cargo and tanker ships: a first approach applying annual discharge of 200 Mt Ca(OH)2 constant over the alkalinization period and a second approach with gradually increasing discharge proportional to the surface pH trend of the baseline scenario, reaching similar amounts of annual discharge by the end of the alkalinization period. We demonstrate that the latter approach allows to stabilize the mean surface pH at present day values and substantially increase the potential to counteract acidification relative to the alkalinity added, while the carbon uptake efficiency (mole of CO2 absorbed by the ocean per mole of alkalinity added) is only marginally reduced. Nevertheless, significant local alterations of the surface pH persist, calling for an investigation of the physiological and ecological implications of the extent of these alterations to the carbonate system in the short to medium term in order to support a safe, sustainable application of this CDR implementation.

TI  - Carbon outwelling across the shelf following a massive mangrove dieback in Australia: Insights from radium isotopes
AB  - Mangrove soil carbon stocks are known to decrease following forest loss due to respiration and enhanced soil CO 2 emissions. However, changes in carbon outwelling to the coastal ocean due to mangrove forest disturbance have not been considered. In December 2015, an extremely large mangrove dieback event (âˆ¼7000 hectares, spanning 1000 km of coastline) occurred in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia. To assess the effect this dieback event had on carbon outwelling, we used radium isotopes and dissolved carbon measurements (dissolved organic carbon, DOC, dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC, and total alkalinity, TAlk) to estimate cross-shelf carbon transport from living and dead mangrove areas and to calculate the carbon losses from living and dead forest soils via SGD. Radium distributions imply cross shelf eddy diffusivity of 107.5 Â± 26.9 and 104.6 Â± 23.9 m âˆ’2 s âˆ’1 from dead and living areas and radium water ages reveal that mangrove carbon reaches 10 km offshore within 7 days. Outwelling rates from living and dead areas were explained by soil carbon losses via SGD. This study suggests a decrease in carbon outwelling to the ocean from dead forest areas compares to living areas by 0â€“12% for DOC, 50â€“52% for DIC and by 37â€“51% for TAlk âˆ¼8 months after the dieback event occurred. Changes to oceanic carbon outwelling rates following mangrove loss are likely driven by a gradual depletion of carbon stocks from the sediment profile. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - A batch study on the bio-fixation of carbon dioxide in the absorbed solution from a chemical wet scrubber by hot spring and marine algae
AB  - Carbon dioxide mass transfer is a key factor in cultivating micro-algae except for the light limitation of photosynthesis. It is a novel idea to enhance mass transfer with the cyclic procedure of absorbing CO2 with a high performance alkaline abosorber such as a packed tower and regenerating the alkaline solution with algal photosynthesis. Hence, the algae with high affinity for alkaline condition must be purified. In this study, a hot spring alga (HSA) was purified from an alkaline hot spring (pH 9.3, 62 Â°C) in Taiwan and grows well over pH 11.5 and 50 Â°C. For performance of HSA, CO2 removal efficiencies in the packed tower increase about 5-fold in a suitable growth condition compared to that without adding any potassium hydroxide. But ammonia solution was not a good choice for this system with regard to carbon dioxide removal efficiency because of its toxicity on HSA. In addition, HSA also exhibits a high growth rate under the controlled pHs from 7 to 11. Besides, a well mass balance of carbon and nitrogen made sure that less other byproducts formed in the procedure of carboxylation. For analysis of some metals in HSA, such as Mg, Mn, Fe, Zn, related to the photosynthesis increased by a rising cultivated pH and revealed that those metals might be accumulated under alkaline conditions but the growth rate was still limited by the ratio of bicarbonate (useful carbon source) and carbonate. Meanwhile, Nannochlopsis oculta (NAO) was also tested under different additional carbon sources. The results revealed that solutions of sodium/potassium carbonate are better carbon sources than ammonia carbonate/bicarbonate for the growth of NAO. However, pH 9.6 of growth limitation based on sodium was lower than one of HSA. The integrated system is, therefore, more feasible to treat CO2 in the flue gases using the algae with higher alkaline affinity such as HSA in small volume bioreactors. Â© 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Ocean alkalinity enhancement - avoiding runaway CaCO3 precipitation during quick and hydrated lime dissolution
AB  - Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) is a method that can remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and counteract ocean acidification through the dissolution of alkaline minerals. Currently, critical knowledge gaps exist regarding the dissolution of different minerals suitable for OAE in natural seawater. Of particular importance is to understand how much alkaline mineral can be dissolved before secondary precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) occurs, since secondary CaCO3 precipitation reduces the atmospheric CO2 uptake potential of OAE. Using two types of mineral proposed for OAE, quick lime (CaO) and hydrated lime (Ca(OH)(2)), we show that both (<63 mu m of diameter) dissolved in seawater within a few hours. No CaCO3 precipitation occurred at a saturation state (Omega(A)) of similar to 5, but CaCO3 precipitation in the form of aragonite occurred above an Omega(A) value of 7. This limit is lower than expected for typical pseudo-homogeneous precipitation, i.e. in the presence of colloids and organic matter. Secondary precipitation at low Omega(A) ( similar to 7) was the result of heterogeneous precipitation onto mineral surfaces, most likely onto the added CaO and Ca(OH)(2) particles. Most importantly, runaway CaCO3 precipitation was observed, a condition where significantly more total alkalinity (TA) was removed than initially added. Such runaway precipitation could reduce the OAE CO2 uptake efficiency from similar to 0.8 mol of CO2 per mole of added TA down to 0.1 mol of CO2 per mole of TA. Runaway precipitation appears to be avoidable by dilution below the critical Omega(A) threshold of 5, ideally within hours of the mineral additions to minimise initial CaCO3 precipitation. Finally, OAE simulations suggest that for the same Omega(A) threshold, the amount of TA that can be added to seawater would be more than 3 times higher at 5 degrees C than at 30 degrees C. The maximum TA addition could also be increased by equilibrating the seawater to atmospheric CO2 levels (i.e. to a pCO(2) of similar to 416 mu atm) during addition. This would allow for more TA to be added in seawater without inducing CaCO3 precipitation, using OAE at its CO2 removal potential.

TI  - Enhancement of the North Atlantic CO2 sink by Arctic Waters
AB  - The North Atlantic north of 50 degrees N is one of the most intense ocean sink areas for atmospheric CO2 considering the flux per unit area, 0.27 Pg-C yr(-1), equivalent to 2 :5 molCm(-2) yr(-1). The northwest Atlantic Ocean is a region with high anthropogenic carbon inventories. This is on account of processes which sustain CO2 air-sea fluxes, in particular strong seasonal winds, ocean heat loss, deep convective mixing, and CO2 drawdown by primary production. The region is in the northern limb of the global thermohaline circulation, a path for the long-term deep-sea sequestration of carbon dioxide. The surface water masses in the North Atlantic are of contrasting origins and character, with the northward-flowing North Atlantic Drift, a Gulf Stream offspring, on the one hand and on the other hand the cold southward-moving low-salinity Polar and Arctic waters with signatures from Arctic freshwater sources. We have studied by observation the CO2 air-sea flux of the relevant water masses in the vicinity of Iceland in all seasons and in different years. Here we show that the highest ocean CO2 influx is to the Arctic and Polar waters, respectively, -3.8 +/- 0.4 and 4.4 +/- 0.3 molCm(-2) yr(-1). These waters are CO2 undersaturated in all seasons. The Atlantic Water is a weak or neutral sink, near CO2 saturation, after poleward drift from subtropical latitudes. These characteristics of the three water masses are confirmed by data from observations covering 30 years. We relate the Polar Water and Arctic Water persistent undersaturation and CO2 influx to the excess alkalinity derived from Arctic sources. Carbonate chemistry equilibrium calculations clearly indicate that the excess alkalinity may support at least 0.058 Pg-Cyr(-1), a significant portion of the North Atlantic CO2 sink. The Arctic contribution to the North At-lantic CO2 sink which we reveal was previously unrecognized. However, we point out that there are gaps and conflicts in the knowledge about the Arctic alkalinity and carbonate budgets and that future trends in the North Atlantic CO2 sink are connected to developments in the rapidly warming and changing Arctic. The results we present need to be taken into consideration for the following question: will the North Atlantic continue to absorb CO2 in the future as it has in the past?

TI  - Enhanced Organic Carbon Burial in Sediments of Oxygen Minimum Zones Upon Ocean Deoxygenation
AB  - Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) in the ocean are expanding. This expansion is attributed to global warming and may continue over the next 10 to 100 kyrs due to multiple climate CO2-driven factors. The expansion of oxygen-deficient waters has the potential to enhance organic carbon burial in marine sediments, thereby providing a negative feedback on global warming. Here, we study the response of dissolved oxygen in the ocean to increased phosphorus and iron inputs due to CO2-driven enhanced weathering and increased dust emissions, respectively. We use an ocean biogeochemical model coupled to a general ocean circulation model (the Hamburg Oceanic Carbon Cycle model, HAMOCC 2.0) to assess the impact of such regional deoxygenation on organic carbon burial in the modern ocean on time scales of up to 200 kyrs. We find that an increase in input of phosphorus and iron leads to an expansion of the area of the OMZ impinging on continental margin sediments and a significant decline in bottom water oxygen in the open ocean relative to pre-industrial conditions. The associated increase in organic carbon burial could contribute to the drawdown of similar to 1,600 Gt of carbon, which is equivalent to the total amount of CO2 in the atmosphere predicted for the year 2100 in a business as usual scenario, on time scales of up to 50 kyrs. The corresponding areal extent of sediments overlain by bottom waters with little or no oxygen as estimated by the model is not very different from the minimum area estimated for two major oceanic anoxic events in Earth's past. Such events were associated with major perturbations of the oceanic carbon cycle, including high rates of organic carbon burial. We conclude that organic carbon burial in low oxygen areas in the ocean could contribute to removal of anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere on long time scales.

TI  - Deriving Nickel (Ni(II)) and Chromium (Cr(III)) Based Environmentally Safe Olivine Guidelines for Coastal Enhanced Silicate Weathering
AB  - Enhanced silicate weathering (ESW) by spreading finely ground silicate rock along the coastal zone to remove atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is a proposed climate change mitigation technique. The abundant and fast-dissolving mineral olivine has received the most attention for this application. However, olivine contains nickel (Ni) and chromium (Cr), which may pose a risk to marine biota during a gigaton-scale ESW application. Herein we derive a first guideline for coastal olivine dispersal based on existing marine environmental quality standards (EQS) for Ni and Cr. Results show that benthic biota are at the highest risk when olivine and its associated trace metals are mixed in the surface sediment. Specifically, depending on local sedimentary Ni concentrations, 0.059-1.4 kg of olivine m-2of seabed could be supplied without posing risks for benthic biota. Accordingly, globally coastal ESW could safely sequester only 0.51-37 Gt of CO2in the 21st century. On the basis of current EQS, we conclude that adverse environmental impacts from Ni and Cr release could reduce the applicability of olivine in coastal ESW. Our findings call for more in-depth studies on the potential toxicity of olivine toward benthic marine biota, especially in regard to bioavailability and metal mixture toxicity. Â© 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Effectiveness and characteristics of atmospheric CO2 removal in croplands via enhanced weathering of industrial Ca-rich silicate byproducts
AB  - Enhanced weathering of industrial Ca-rich silicate byproducts in croplands is potentially profitable for large-scale atmospheric CO2 removal; during the weathering process, CO2 dissolves to form HCO3 (-) and CO3 (2-) in alkaline soil pore water, which eventually flows into the ocean. However, the effectiveness of such systems is still in doubt, owing to the unrealistic models used for prediction and the insufficient consideration of the dynamic influences of soils on fluid chemistry. We determined the effectiveness of such systems for atmospheric CO2 removal, along with their characteristics, through a set of batch- and flow-through-type laboratory experiments, using andosol and decomposed granite soil as agricultural and non-agricultural soils, respectively, and Portland cement, steelmaking slag, and coal fly ash as industrial byproducts. The results of the batch-type experiments demonstrated that agricultural soils were suitable for CO2 removal, owing to their moderately high pH and Ca concentrations in pore water that prevented intensive calcium carbonate precipitation. The flow-through experiments demonstrated that a higher Ca-content byproduct can have a large atmospheric CO2 removal capacity. However, the magnitude of CO2 removal and its time-dependent behavior were difficult to predict because they were not in conjunction with the changes in the average pH value. This indicated that the diffusive transport of CO2 from the atmosphere-soil interface to deeper soils was more complex than expected. Maximizing CO2 removal requires a better understanding of the diffusive transport of CO2 through gas-filled pore spaces, created by unsteady-state air-water two-phase flow, due to intermittent rainfall.

TI  - Thorough conversion of CO2 through two-step accelerated mineral carbonation in the MgCl2-CaCl2-H2O system
AB  - This study describes a two-step accelerated mineral carbonation technology at moderate temperatures and atmospheric pressure by choosing the ``problematic ions for seawater utilization{''} as mineralizers in the simplified seawater-MgCl2-CaCl2-H2O system, that is, Ca2+ as the first mineralizer and Mg2+ in the residual solution as the second. Not only can carbonate ions generated from the absorption and ionization of CO2 be fixed by Ca2+ through the first carbonation process with the added alkali source, MgO, but HCO3- in the residual solution can also be mineralized by Mg2+ through the second carbonation process. Meanwhile, pure CaCO3 and MgCO3 center dot 3H(2)O, which have the possible benefit of reuse, can be obtained as by-products. Then, more variables were set to optimize the technical conditions to enhance the decalcification rate and carbon sequestration ratio, reduce the reaction time during the first mineralization and attempt to realize the combination of HCO3- and Mg2+ by adding NaOH to produce MgCO3 center dot 3H(2)O as another by-product in a moderate environment during the second mineralization.

TI  - Negative emissions-Part 2: Costs, potentials and side effects
AB  - The most recent IPCC assessment has shown an important role for negative emissions technologies (NETs) in limiting global warming to 2 degrees C cost-effectively. However, a bottom-up, systematic, reproducible, and transparent literature assessment of the different options to remove CO2 from the atmosphere is currently missing. In part 1 of this three-part review on NETs, we assemble a comprehensive set of the relevant literature so far published, focusing on seven technologies: bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation and reforestation, direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), enhanced weathering, ocean fertilisation, biochar, and soil carbon sequestration. In this part, part 2 of the review, we present estimates of costs, potentials, and side-effects for these technologies, and qualify them with the authors' assessment. Part 3 reviews the innovation and scaling challenges that must be addressed to realise NETs deployment as a viable climate mitigation strategy. Based on a systematic review of the literature, our best estimates for sustainable global NET potentials in 2050 are 0.5-3.6 GtCO(2) yr(-1) for afforestation and reforestation, 0.5-5GtCO(2) yr(-1) for BECCS, 0.5-2GtCO(2) yr(-1) for biochar, 2-4 GtCO(2) yr(-1) for enhanced weathering, 0.5-5 GtCO(2) yr(-1) for DACCS, and up to 5GtCO(2) yr(-1) for soil carbon sequestration. Costs vary widely across the technologies, as do their permanency and cumulative potentials beyond 2050. It is unlikely that a single NET will be able to sustainably meet the rates of carbon uptake described in integrated assessment pathways consistent with 1.5 degrees C of global warming.

TI  - An Assessment of Direct Dissolved Inorganic Carbon Injection to the Coastal Region: A Model Result
AB  - The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has increased in the past 60 years and the technology of carbon capture and storage (CCS) has recently been extensively studied. One of the strategies of CCS is to directly inject a high dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration (or high partial pressure of carbon dioxide, pCO(2)) solution into the ocean. However, the carbonate dynamics and air-sea gas exchange are usually neglected in a CCS strategy. This study assesses the effect of a DIC-solution injection by using a simple two end-member model to simulate the variation of pH, DIC, total alkalinity (TA) and pCO(2) between the river and sea mixing process for the Danshuei River estuary and Hoping River in Taiwan. We observed that the DIC-solution injection can contribute to ocean acidification and can also lead the pCO(2) value to change from being undersaturated to oversaturated (with respect to the atmospheric CO2 level). Our model result also showed that the maximum Revelle factors (Delta{[}CO2]/{[}CO2])/(Delta{[}DIC]/{[}DIC]) among varied pH values (6-9) and DIC concentrations (0.5-3.5 mmol kg(-1)) were between pH 8.3 and 8.5 in fresh water and were between 7.3 and 7.5 in waters with a salinity of 35, reflecting the changing efficiency of dissolving CO2 gas into the DIC solution and the varying stability of this desired DIC solution. Finally, we suggest this uncoupled Revelle factor between fresh and salty water should be considered in the (anthropogenic) carbonate chemical weathering on a decade to century scale.

TI  - Sediment acidification and temperature increase in an artificial CO2 vent
AB  - We investigated the effect of an artificial CO2 vent (0.0015âˆ’0.037 mol sâˆ’1), simulating a leak from a reservoir for carbon capture and storage (CCS), on the sediment geochemistry. CO2 was injected 3 m deep into the seafloor at 120 m depth. With increasing mass flow an increasing number of vents were observed, distributed over an area of approximately 3 m. In situ profiling with microsensors for pH, T, O2 and ORP showed the geochemical effects are localized in a small area around the vents and highly variable. In measurements remote from the vent, the pH reached a value of 7.6 at a depth of 0.06 m. In a CO2 venting channel, pH reduced to below 5. Steep temperature profiles were indicative of a heat source inside the sediment. Elevated total alkalinity and Ca2+ levels showed calcite dissolution. Venting decreased sulfate reduction rates, but not aerobic respiration. A transport-reaction model confirmed that a large fraction of the injected CO2 is transported laterally into the sediment and that the reactions between CO2 and sediment generate enough heat to elevate the temperature significantly. A CO2 leak will have only local consequences for sediment biogeochemistry, and only a small fraction of the escaped CO2 will reach the sediment surface. Â© 2020

TI  - Reducing energy-related CO2 emissions using accelerated weathering of limestone
AB  - The use and impacts of accelerated weathering of limestone (AWL; reaction: CO2+H2O+CaCO3â†’Ca2++2(HCO3-) is explored as a CO2 capture and sequestration method. It is shown that significant limestone resources are relatively close to a majority of CO2-emitting power plants along the coastal US, a favored siting location for AWL. Waste fines, representing more than 20% of current US crushed limestone production (&gt;109 tonnes/yr), could provide an inexpensive or free source of AWL carbonate. With limestone transportation then as the dominant cost variable, CO2 mitigation costs of $3-$4/tonne appear to be possible in certain locations. Perhaps 10-20% of US point-source CO2 emissions could be mitigated in this fashion. It is experimentally shown that CO2 sequestration rates of 10-6 to 10-5 moles/sec per m2 of limestone surface area are achievable, with reaction densities on the order of 10-2 tonnes CO2 m-3day-1, highly dependent on limestone particle size, solution turbulence and flow, and CO2 concentration. Modeling shows that AWL would allow carbon storage in the ocean with significantly reduced impacts to seawater pH relative to direct CO2 disposal into the atmosphere or sea. The addition of AWL-derived alkalinity to the ocean may itself be beneficial for marine biota. Â© 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Negative emissions technologies and carbon capture and storage to achieve the Paris Agreement commitments
AB  - How will the global atmosphere and climate be protected? Achieving net-zero CO2 emissions will require carbon capture and storage (CCS) to reduce current GHG emission rates, and negative emissions technology (NET) to recapture previously emitted greenhouse gases. Delivering NET requires radical cost and regulatory innovation to impact on climate mitigation. Present NET exemplars are few, are at small-scale and not deployable within a decade, with the exception of rock weathering, or direct injection of CO2 into selected ocean water masses. To keep warming less than 2 degrees C, bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) has been modelled but does not yet exist at industrial scale. CCS already exists in many forms and at low cost. However, CCS has no political drivers to enforce its deployment. We make a new analysis of all global CCS projects and model the build rate out to 2050, deducing this is 100 times too slow. Our projection to 2050 captures just 700 Mt CO2 yr(-1), not the minimum 6000 Mt CO2 yr(-1) required to meet the 2 degrees C target. Hence new policies are needed to incentivize commercial CCS. A first urgent action for all countries is to commercially assess their CO2 storage. A second simple action is to assign a Certificate of CO2 Storage onto producers of fossil carbon, mandating a progressively increasing proportion of CO2 to be stored. No CCS means no 2 degrees C. This article is part of the theme issue `The Paris Agreement: understanding the physical and social challenges for a warming world of 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels'.

TI  - Beyond carbon pricing: policy levers for negative emissions technologies
AB  - This paper explores policies for Negative Emissions Technologies (NETs), in an attempt to move beyond the supply-side focus of the majority of NETs research, as well as the current dominance of carbon pricing as the main NETs policy proposal. The paper identifies a number of existing policies from four key areasÂ â€“ energy/transport, agriculture, sub-soil, and oceansÂ â€“ which will have an impact on three NETs: Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), Direct Air Capture (DAC), and terrestrial Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW). We propose that non-climate co-benefits may be valuable in terms of the policy â€˜demand pullâ€™ for NETs; in particular, we find that ERW may provide multiple co-benefits which can be mandated through existing policy structures. However, interaction with numerous policy areas may also create barriers, particularly where there is tension between the priorities of different government departments. On the basis of existing and analogous policies from a range of geographical contexts and scales, this paper proposes four options for NETs policy that could be reasonably implemented in the near-term. We also argue that ERW demonstrates the importance of scale and framing, because the policy environment depends on whether it is framed as a soil amendment at local scales or as a climate stabilization technique at international scale. Key policy insights Co-benefits may assist the â€˜demand pullâ€™ for novel technologies by providing multiple policy angles for incentivisation rather than relying on a â€˜fix-allâ€™ policy such as a high carbon price. DAC with storage might be overly reliant on a high carbon price, because it only provides one core benefitâ€“that of atmospheric carbon reduction. ERW may provide multiple co-benefits which can be mandated through existing policy structures, but should focus on using waste rock rather than mining virgin material. We propose four near-term options for NETs policy: funding for small-scale BECCS demonstration and an international biomass certification mechanism; small-scale loans for ERW on farms and promotion of locally-sourced rock residues; amendment of fertilizer subsidy schemes to include silicate rock; and a clearer framework for licensing sub-soil access for CO2 storage.

TI  - Limits and CO2 equilibration of near-coast alkalinity enhancement
AB  - Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) has recently gained attention as a potential method for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) at gigatonne (Gt) scale, with near-coast OAE operations being economically favorable due to proximity to mineral and energy sources. In this paper we study critical questions which determine the scale and viability of OAE. Which coastal locations are able to sustain a large flux of alkalinity at minimal pH and omega(Arag )(aragonite saturation) changes? What is the interference distance between adjacent OAE projects? How much CO2 is absorbed per unit of alkalinity added? How quickly does the induced CO2 deficiency equilibrate with the atmosphere? Choosing relatively conservative constraints on delta pH or delta Omega, we examine the limits of OAE using the ECCO LLC270 (0.3 degrees) global circulation model. We find that the sustainable OAE rate varies over 1-2 orders of magnitude between different coasts and exhibits complex patterns and non-local dependencies which vary from region to region. In general, OAE in areas of strong coastal currents enables the largest fluxes and depending on the direction of these currents, neighboring OAE sites can exhibit dependencies as far as 400 km or more. At these steady state fluxes most regional stretches of coastline are able to accommodate on the order of 10s to 100s of megatonnes of negative emissions within 300 km of the coast. We conclude that near-coastal OAE has the potential to scale globally to several Gt CO2 yr(-1) of drawdown with conservative pH constraints, if the effort is spread over the majority of available coastlines. Depending on the location, we find a diverse set of equilibration kinetics, determined by the interplay of gas exchange and surface residence time. Most locations reach an uptake efficiency plateau of 0.6-0.8 mol CO2 per mol of alkalinity after 3-4 years, after which there is only slow additional CO2 uptake. Regions of significant downwelling (e.g., around Iceland) should be avoided by OAE deployments, as in such locations up to half of the CDR potential of OAE can be lost to bottom waters. The most ideal locations, reaching a molar uptake ratio of around 0.8, include North Madagascar, California, Brazil, Peru and locations close to the Southern Ocean such as Tasmania, Kerguelen and Patagonia, where the gas exchange appears to occur faster than the surface residence time. However, some locations (e.g., Hawaii) take significantly longer to equilibrate (up to 8-10 years) but can still eventually achieve high uptake ratios.

TI  - News research &amp; development: Carbon capture: New method for extracting CO2 from atmosphere
AB  - Leverhulme Centre for Climate Change Mitigation (LCCCM), a new research center at UK's Sheffield University, is developing processes to safely remove large amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere to cool the planet, while also mitigating ocean acidification. The researchers at LCCCM are embarking on a 10-yr project that involves Earth system modeling and controlled environment experimental investigations. The method involves accelerating natural rock weathering processes by using plants to break down silicate rocks into minerals that will absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. The research team hopes their method could reduce atmospheric CO2 by â‰¥ 300 ppm by 2100 if they can achieve a silicate rock application rate target of 5 kg/m2/yr.

TI  - Enhanced weathering of olivine in seawater: The efficiency as revealed by thermodynamic scenario analysis
AB  - Enhanced weathering of olivine has been suggested as a measure to lower the atmospheric CO2 level and it might also mitigate ocean acidification. This study aimed to characterise how olivine can weather in seawater, to elucidate the role of secondary precipitation and to ascertain the efficiency in terms of molar CO2 removal per mole of olivine dissolution. Geochemical thermodynamic equilibrium modelling was used, which considered both the variable mineralogical composition of olivine and the kinds of secondary precipitates that may be formed. The advantage is that such an approach is independent from local or regional factors as temperature, related kinetics, mineralogy, etc. The results show that the efficiency falls when secondary precipitates are formed. When Fe-bearing olivine undergoes weathering in an oxic environment, Fe(III) hydroxides will inevitably be formed, and as a result of this acidifying process, CO2 could be released to the atmosphere. This might also enhance ocean acidification when Fe-rich olivine becomes used. Ocean alkalinisation only happens when more than 1Â mol/kgH2O Mg-rich olivine weathers. Maintenance of supersaturation for calcite or aragonite as holds in seawater reduces the efficiency by about a factor of two compared to the efficiency without secondary precipitation. Precipitation of sepiolite as Mg silicate reduces the efficiency even more. Magnesite precipitation has a similar effect to Ca carbonate precipitation, but according to the literature magnesite precipitation is improbable at ambient conditions and relatively low supersaturation. When less than 0.05Â mmolÂ olivine/kg(seawater) weathers the efficiency is slightly different than at higher intensities, due to strong buffering by seawater alkalinity. Â© 2016 The Author

TI  - The Carbon-Capture Efficiency of Natural Water Alkalinization: Implications For Enhanced weathering
AB  - Enhanced weathering (EW) is a promising negative-emission technology that artificially accelerates the dissolution of natural minerals, promotes biomass growth, and alleviates the acidification of soils and natural waters. EW aims to increase the alkalinity of natural waters (alkalinization) to promote a transfer of CO2 from the atmosphere to the water. Here we provide a quantification of the alkalinization carbon-capture efficiency (ACE) as a function of the water chemistry. ACE can be used for any alkaline mineral in various natural waters. We show that ACE strongly depends on the water pH, with a sharp transition from minimum to maximum in a narrow interval of pH values. We also quantify ACE in three compartments of the land-to-ocean aquatic continuum: the world topsoils, the lakes of an acid-sensitive area, and the global surface ocean. The results reveal that the efficiency of terrestrial EW varies markedly, from 0 to 100 %, with a significant trade-off in acidic conditions between carbon-capture efficiency and enhanced chemical dissolution. The efficiency is more stable in the ocean, with a typical value of around 80 % and a latitudinal pattern driven by differences in seawater temperature and salinity. Our results point to the importance of an integrated hydrological and biogeochemical theory to assess the fate of the weathering products across the aquatic continuum from land to ocean.

TI  - The life cycle environmental impacts of negative emission technologies in North America
AB  - Negative emission technologies (NETs) could play a key role in ensuring net-zero and longer-term net negative emission ambitions are met. However, greenhouse gas emissions (and other pollutants) will occur over the life cycle of a NET and will need to be taken into consideration when developing schemes to roll out their use. We compare five NETs: afforestation/reforestation (AR), enhanced weathering (EW), mangrove restoration (MR), bioenergy and direct air capture with carbon storage (BECCS and DAC), using life cycle assessment to determine their environmental impacts (global warming, freshwater, toxicity etc.). We find that there is a wide range in the environmental impacts estimated across the NETs and the context in which they are used will directly impact which NET has low or high environmental impacts. This is an important aspect to consider when deciding which NET to prioritise in strategies to roll out their use on large scales. If consistent removal of CO2 from the atmosphere is the goal, then AR and MR have the lowest environmental impacts. However, if large and quick CO2 removal is the goal then EW, DAC and BECCS have similar, if not lower, environmental impacts. Â© 2022 The Authors

TI  - Potential risks of CO2 removal project based on carbonate pump to marine ecosystem
AB  - The development of marine carbon sequestration project has an important potential for carbon neutralization in the short-term (several decades). Marine carbon sequestration technology is based on biological and carbonate pumps to increase particulate organic carbon and authigenic insoluble carbonates to the deep sea or seafloor, aiming to achieve permanent carbon sequestration. Particularly, chemical carbon sequestration technology based on carbonate pump is proposed and considered to achieve short-term marine carbon sequestration in recent years. This technology mainly includes alkaline mineral addition and combining CO32âˆ’ to insoluble carbonates to improve marine carbon fixation capacity. Potential marine ecosystem risks of chemical CO2 removal method should be considered before being a feasible technology. We reviewed the potential effects of marine chemical carbon sequestration project on marine organisms. Marine chemical carbon sequestration had two main effects on marine organisms: released chemicals effect, and particle effect. Released chemicals in mineral weathering directly affected phytoplankton and bacteria community. Particles formed during carbon sequestration process mainly affected filter feeding organisms. The toxic effects of particles on aquatic organisms increased with decreasing sizes and increasing concentrations of particle. Algae and crustaceans were the most sensitive groups exposed to metal nanoparticles (nm-Î¼m) in seawaters, thus could be used as target species to evaluate ecological risk of small particles generated in chemical carbon sequestration project. Embryos or larva of filter feeding organisms were more sensitive to large clay and metal microparticles (Î¼mâ€‘mm) than adults, thus could be used as sensitive groups to establish safety concentration of large particles. The relatively inert metal nanoparticles and microparticles had higher safety concentrations than active ones. These particle concentration thresholds could be as a reference to design concentrations and initial sizes of applied minerals in marine chemical carbon sequestration project. This will ensure that the ecological risk is minimized when carbon fixation efficiency is maximized. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Detectability of Artificial Ocean Alkalinization and Stratospheric Aerosol Injection in MPI-ESM
AB  - To monitor the success of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) or solar radiation management (SRM) that offset anthropogenic climate change, the forced response to any external forcing is required to be detectable against internal variability. Thus far, only the detectability of SRM has been examined using both a stationary and nonstationary detection and attribution method. Here, the spatiotemporal detectability of the forced response to artificial ocean alkalinization (AOA) and stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) as exemplary methods for CDR and SRM, respectively, is compared in Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) experiments using regularized optimal fingerprinting and single-model estimates of internal variability, while working under a stationary or nonstationary null hypothesis. Although both experiments are forced by emissions according to the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) and target the climate of the RCP4.5 scenario using AOA or SAI, detection timescales reflect the fundamentally different forcing agents. Moreover, detectability timescales are sensitive to the choice of null hypothesis. Globally, changes in the CO2 system in seawater are detected earlier than the response in temperature to AOA but later in the case of SAI. Locally, the detection time scales depend on the physical, chemical, and radiative impacts of CDR and SRM forcing on the climate system, as well as patterns of internal variability, which is highlighted for oceanic heat and carbon storage.

Most enhanced weathering studies focus on the capacity of silicate rocks (e.g., basalt) and minerals (e.g., olivine, Mg2SiO4, or wollastonite CaSiO3) to remove atmospheric CO2. However, carbonate minerals (e.g., calcite, CaCO3) could provide an additional, rapid way to increase (Formula presented.) export to the oceans. Recent studies suggest that 0.84 Gt C yrâˆ’1 could be removed from the atmosphere through the enhanced dissolution of calcite in soils, provided carbonic acid is the main dissolution agent. What is not clear is whether atmospheric CO2 dissolved in soils can be transported by rivers, which typically have lower [pCO2], to the oceans. This difference in calcite solubility between soils (where weathering occurs) and rivers (where (Formula presented.) is transported) may lead to large amounts of secondary carbonate formation during transport, releasing the CO2 consumed through dissolution. Here, we present a modeling study comparing the estimated soil dissolution capacity (SDC) in 149 of Earth's largest river basins, to the potential transport capacity of carbon (PTCC) in corresponding rivers. We find the SDC can only be exported to the oceans, without secondary carbonate precipitation, if rivers are in disequilibrium with respect to calcite (i.e., SIc = 1). In this instance, 0.92 Gt C yrâˆ’1 may be sequestered above background weathering rates, which is ~20% of annual increases in atmospheric carbon. If rivers are at equilibrium with calcite (i.e., SIc = 0), approximately two-thirds of the carbon dissolved in soil waters are lost due to calcite precipitation in rivers, and just 0.26 Gt of additional atmospheric C yrâˆ’1 can be transported to the oceans. Overall, the efficacy of enhanced carbonate weathering is a function of the capacity rivers have for transporting the products from carbonate weathering to the oceans, rather than the dissolution capacity of soils. These findings have implications for the efficiency of enhancing silicate weathering for ocean alkalinity enhancement, as secondary carbonate precipitation during transport is not always considered.

TI  - Assessment by self-organizing maps of element release from sediments in contact with acidified seawater in laboratory leaching test conditions
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is gaining interest as a significant global option to reduce emissions of CO2. CCS development requires an assessment of the potential risks associated with CO2 leakages from storage sites. Laboratory leaching tests have proved to be a useful tool to study the potential mobilization of metals from contaminated sediment in a decreased-pH environment that mimics such a leakage event. This work employs a self-organizing map (SOM) tool to interpret and analyze the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn from equilibrium, column, and pH-dependent leaching tests. In these tests, acidified seawater is used for simulating different CO2 leakage scenarios. Classification was carried out detailing the mobilization of contaminants for environments of varying pH, liquid-to-solid ratio, and type of contact of the laboratory leaching tests. Component planes in the SOMs allow visualization of the results and the determination of the worst case of element release. The pH-dependent leaching test with initial addition of either base or acid was found to mobilize the highest concentrations of metals. Â© 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

TI  - Enhanced carbonate dissolution: A means of sequestering waste CO2 as ocean bicarbonate
AB  - The reaction of a mineral carbonate, such as limestone, with water and CO2 to form bicarbonate in solution, is explored as a CO2 mitigation strategy. Initial cost estimates for such a process range from $18 to $128 per tonne CO2 sequestered, with an energy penalty of about 8% and with relatively low environmental impact. The regional availability and transport of water and mineral carbonate appear to be the primary determinants of the strategy's cost and applicability. The bicarbonate-rich waste effluent would be released into rivers or coastal waters, ultimately adding a small amount to the existing, very large bicarbonate reservoir in the ocean. For many applications, this form of `marine' carbon sequestration appears to be less costly, less affected by national and international regulations, more environmentally friendly and more effective over the long term than direct CO2 injection into the ocean.

TI  - A Unique Diel Pattern in Carbonate Chemistry in the Seagrass Meadows of Dongsha Island: The Enhancement of Metabolic Carbonate Dissolution in a Semienclosed Lagoon
AB  - In contrast to other seagrass meadows where seawater carbonate chemistry generally shows strong diel variations with higher pH but lower partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) during the daytime and lower pH but higher pCO(2) during nighttime due to the alternation in photosynthesis and respiration, the seagrass meadows of the inner lagoon (IL) on Dongsha Island had a unique diel pattern with extremely high pH and low pCO(2) across a diel cycle. We suggest that this distinct diel pattern in pH and pCO(2) could be associated with the enhancement of total alkalinity (TA) production coupled to carbonate sediment dissolution in a semienclosed lagoon. The confinement of the IL may hamper water exchange and seagrass detritus export to the adjacent open ocean, which may result in higher organic matter loading to the sediments, and longer residence time of the water in the IL, accompanied by microbial respiration (both aerobic and anaerobic) that may reduce carbonate saturation level to drive carbonate dissolution and thus TA elevation, thereby forming such a unique diel pattern in carbonate chemistry. This finding further highlights the importance of considering TA production through metabolic carbonate dissolution when evaluating the potential of coastal blue carbon ecosystems to buffer ocean acidification and to absorb atmospheric CO2, in particular in a semienclosed setting.

TI  - The Potential for Ocean-Based Climate Action: Negative Emissions Technologies and Beyond
AB  - The effectiveness, feasibility, duration of effects, co-benefits, disbenefits, cost effectiveness and governability of four ocean-based negative emissions technologies (NETs) are assessed in comparison to eight other ocean-based measures. Their role in revising UNFCCC Parties' future Nationally Determined Contributions is discussed in the broad context of ocean-based actions for both mitigation and ecological adaptation. All measures are clustered in three policy-relevant categories (Decisive, Low Regret, Concept Stage). None of the ocean-based NETs assessed are identified as Decisive at this stage. One is Low Regret (Restoring and increasing coastal vegetation), and three are at Concept Stage, one with low to moderate potential disbenefits (Marine bioenergy with carbon capture and storage) and two with potentially high disbenefits (Enhancing open-ocean productivity and Enhancing weathering and alkalinization). Ocean-based NETs are uncertain but potentially highly effective. They have high priority for research and development. Copyright Â© 2021 Gattuso, Williamson, Duarte and Magnan.

TI  - The potential environmental response to increasing ocean alkalinity for negative emissions
AB  - The negative emissions technology, artificial ocean alkalinization (AOA), aims to store atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in the ocean by increasing total alkalinity (TA). Calcium carbonate saturation state (Omega CaCO3) and pH would also increase meaning that AOA could alleviate sensitive regions and ecosystems from ocean acidification. However, AOA could raise pH and Omega CaCO3 well above modern-day levels, and very little is known about the environmental and biological impact of this. After treating a red calcifying algae (Corallina spp.) to elevated TA seawater, carbonate production increased by 60\% over a control. This has implication for carbon cycling in the past, but also constrains the environmental impact and efficiency of AOA. Carbonate production could reduce the efficiency of CO2 removal. Increasing TA, however, did not significantly influence Corallina spp. primary productivity, respiration, or photophysiology. These results show that AOA may not be intrinsically detrimental for Corallina spp. and that AOA has the potential to lessen the impacts of ocean acidification. However, the experiment tested a single species within a controlled environment to constrain a specific unknown, the rate change of calcification, and additional work is required to understand the impact of AOA on other organisms, whole ecosystems, and the global carbon cycle.

TI  - Potential capture and conversion of CO2 from oceanwater through mineral carbonation
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by human activities not only brings about a serious greenhouse effect but also accelerates global climate change. This has resulted in extreme climate hazards that can obstruct human development in the near future. Hence, there is an urgent need to achieve carbon neutrality by increasing negative emissions. The ocean plays a vital role in absorbing and sequestering CO2. Current research on marine carbon storage and sink enhancement mainly focuses on biological carbon sequestration using carbon sinks (macroalgae, shellfish, and fisheries). However, seawater inorganic carbon accounts for more than 95 % of the total carbon in marine carbon storage. Increasing total alkalinity at a constant dissolved inorganic carbon shifts the balance of existing seawater carbonate system and prompts a greater absorption of atmospheric CO2, thereby increasing the ocean's â€œcarbon sinkâ€. This review explores two main mechanisms (i.e., enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization) and materials (e.g., silicate rocks, metal oxides, and metal hydroxides) that regulate marine chemical carbon sink (MCCS). This work also compares MCCS with other terrestrial and marine carbon sinks and discusses the implementation of MCCS, including the following aspects: chemical reaction rate, cost, and possible ecological and environmental impacts.

TI  - Interactions of marine mammals and birds with offshore membrane enclosures for growing algae (OMEGA)
AB  - Background: OMEGA is an integrated aquatic system to produce biofuels, treat and recycle wastewater, capture CO2, and expand aquaculture production. This system includes floating photobioreactors (PBRs) that will cover hundreds of hectares in marine bays. To assess the interactions of marine mammals and birds with PBRs, 9 Ã— 1.3Â m flat panel and 9.5 Ã— 0.2Â m tubular PBRs were deployed in a harbor and monitored day and night from October 10, 2011 to Janurary 22, 2012 using infrared video. To observe interactions with pinnipeds, two trained sea lions (Zalophus californianus) and one trained harbor seal (Phoca vitulina richardii) were observed and directed to interact with PBRs in tanks. To determine the forces required to puncture PBR plastic and the effects of weathering, Instron measurements were made with a sea otter (Enhydra lutris) tooth and bird beaks.Results: A total of 1,445 interactions of marine mammals and birds with PBRs were observed in the 2,424Â hours of video recorded. The 95 marine mammal interactions, 94 by sea otters and one by a sea lion had average durations of three minutes (max 44Â min) and represented about 1% of total recording time. The 1,350 bird interactions, primarily coots (Fulica americana) and gulls (Larus occidentalis and L. californicus) had average durations of six minutes (max. 170) and represented 5% of recording time. Interactive behaviors were characterized as passive (feeding, walking, resting, grooming, and social activity) or proactive (biting, pecking, investigating, and unspecified manipulating). Mammal interactions were predominantly proactive, whereas birds were passive. All interactions occurred primarily during the day. Ninety-six percent of otter interactions occurred in winter, whereas 73% of bird interactions in fall, correlating to their abundance in the harbor. Trained pinnipeds followed most commands to bite, drag, and haul-out onto PBRs, made no overt undirected interactions with the PBRs, but showed avoidance behavior to PBR tethers. Instron measurements indicated that sea-otter teeth and gull beaks can penetrate weathered plastic more easily than new plastic.Conclusions: Otter and bird interactions with experimental PBRs were benign. Large-scale OMEGA systems are predicted to have both positive and negative environmental consequences. Â© 2014 Hughes et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Ocean sequestration of crop residue carbon: recycling fossil fuel carbon back to deep sediments
AB  - For significant impact any method to remove CO 2 from the atmosphere must process large amounts of carbon efficiently, be repeatable, sequester carbon for thousands of years, be practical, economical and be implemented soon. The only method that meets these criteria is removal of crop residues and burial in the deep ocean. We show here that this method is 92% efficient in sequestration of crop residue carbon while cellulosic ethanol production is only 32% and soil sequestration is about 14% efficient. Deep ocean sequestration can potentially capture 15% of the current global CO 2 annual increase, returning that carbon back to deep sediments, confining the carbon for millennia,while using existing capital infrastructure and technology. Because of these clear advantages, we recommend enhanced research into permanent sequestration of crop residues in the deep ocean. Â© 2009 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Modeling the Dynamic Landscape Evolution of a Volcanic Coastal Environment Under Future Climate Trajectories
AB  - As anthropogenic forcing continues to rapidly modify worldwide climate, impacts on landscape changes will grow. Olivine weathering is a natural process that sequesters carbon out of the atmosphere, but is now being proposed as a strategy that can be artificially implemented to assist in the mitigation of anthropogenic carbon emissions. We use the landscape evolution model Badlands to identify a region (Tweed Caldera catchment in Eastern Australia) that has the potential for naturally enhanced supply of mafic sediments, known to be a carbon sink, into coastal environments. Although reality is more complex than what can be captured within a model, our models have the ability to unravel and estimate how erosion of volcanic edifices and landscape dynamics will react to future climate change projections. Local climate projections were taken from the Australian government and the IPCC in the form of four alternative pathways. Three additional scenarios were designed, with added contributions from the Antarctic Ice Sheet, to better understand how the landscape/dynamics might be impacted by an increase in sea level rise due to ice sheet tipping points being hit. Three scenarios were run with sea level held constant and precipitation rates increased in order to better understand the role that precipitation and sea level plays in the regional supply of sediment. Changes between scenarios are highly dependent upon the rate and magnitude of climatic change. We estimate the volume of mafic sediment supplied to the erosive environment within the floodplain (ranging from âˆ¼27 to 30Â millionÂ m3 by 2100 and âˆ¼78â€“315Â millionÂ m3 by 2500), the average amount of olivine within the supplied sediment under the most likely scenarios (âˆ¼7.6Â millionÂ m3 by 2100 and âˆ¼30Â millionÂ m3 by 2500), and the amount of CO2 that is subsequently sequestered (âˆ¼53â€“73Â millionÂ tons by 2100 and âˆ¼206â€“284Â millionÂ tons by 2500). Our approach not only identifies a region that can be further studied in order to evaluate the efficacy and impact of enhanced silicate weathering driven by climate change, but can also help identify other regions that have a natural ability to act as a carbon sink via mafic rock weathering.

TI  - CO2 Air-Sea exchange due to calcium carbonate and organic matter storage, and its implications for the global carbon cycle
AB  - Release of CO2 from surface ocean water owing to precipitation of CaCO3 and the imbalance between biological production of organic matter and its respiration, and their net removal from surface water to sedimentary storage was studied by means of a quotient Î¸ = (CO2 flux to the atmosphere)/(CaCO3 precipitated). Î¸ depends not only on water temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration but also on the CaCO3 and organic carbon masses formed. In CO2 generation by CaCO3 precipitation, Î¸ varies from a fraction of 0.44 to 0.79, increasing with decreasing temperature (25 to 5Â°C), increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration (195-375 ppmv), and increasing CaCO3 precipitated mass (up to 45% of the initial DIC concentration in surface water). Primary production and net storage of organic carbon counteracts the CO2 production by carbonate precipitation and it results in lower CO2 emissions from the surface layer. When atmospheric CO2 increases due to the ocean-to-atmosphere flux rather than remaining constant, the amount of CO2 transferred is a non-linear function of the surface layer thickness because of the back-pressure of the rising atmospheric CO2. For a surface ocean layer approximated by a 50-m-thick euphotic zone that receives input of inorganic and organic carbon from land, the calculated CO2 flux to the atmosphere is a function of the CaCO3 and Corg net storage rates. In general, the carbonate storage rate has been greater than that of organic carbon. The CO2 flux near the Last Glacial Maximum is 17 to 7Ã—1012 mol/yr (0.2-0.08 Gt C/yr), reflecting the range of organic carbon storage rates in sediments, and for pre-industrial time it is 38-42Ã—1012 mol/yr (0.46-0.50 Gt C/yr). Within the imbalanced global carbon cycle, our estimates indicate that prior to anthropogenic emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere the land organic reservoir was gaining carbon and the surface ocean was losing carbon, calcium, and total alkalinity owing to the CaCO3 storage and consequent emission of CO2. These results are in agreement with the conclusions of a number of other investigators. As the CO2 uptake in mineral weathering is a major flux in the global carbon cycle, the CO2 weathering pathway that originates in the CO2 produced by remineralization of soil humus rather than by direct uptake from the atmosphere may reduce the relatively large imbalances of the atmosphere and land organic reservoir at 102-104-year time scales.

TI  - Accelerating carbonate dissolution to sequester carbon dioxide in the ocean: Geochemical implications
AB  - Various methods have been proposed for mitigating release of anthropogenic CO2 to the atmosphere, including deep-sea injection of CO2 captured from fossil-fuel fired power plants. Here, we use a schematic model of ocean chemistry and transport to analyze the geochemical consequences of a new method for separating carbon dioxide from a waste gas stream and sequestering it in the ocean. This method involves reacting CO2-rich power-plant gases with seawater to produce a carbonic acid solution which in turn is reacted on site with carbonate mineral (e.g., limestone) to form Ca2+ and bicarbonate in solution, which can then be released and diluted in the ocean. Such a process is similar to carbonate weathering and dissolution which would have otherwise occurred naturally, but over many millennia. Relative to atmospheric release or direct ocean CO2 injection, this method would greatly expand the capacity of the ocean to store anthropogenic carbon while minimizing environmental Impacts or mts carbon on ocean biota. This carbonate-dissolution technique may be more cost-effective and less environmentally harmful, and than previously proposed CO2 capture and sequestration techniques.

TI  - From serpentinization to carbonation: New insights from a CO2 injection experiment
AB  - We injected a CO2-rich hydrous fluid of seawater chlorinity into an ongoing, mildly reducing (H2(a q) â‰ˆ 3 mmol/kg) serpentinization experiment at 230 Â°C and 35 MPa to examine the changes in fluid chemistry and mineralogy during mineral carbonation. The chemistry of 11 fluid samples was measured, speciated, and compared with MgO-SiO2-H2O-CO2 (MSHC) phase equilibria to approximate the reaction pathway from serpentinization to carbonation. Although the overall system was in apparent disequilibrium, the speciated activities of dissolved silica (aSiO2(a q)) and carbon dioxide (aCO2(a q)) evolved roughly along MSHC equilibrium phase boundaries, indicative of 4 distinct mineral assemblages over time: (1) serpentine-brucite (Â± magnesite) before the injection, to (2) serpentine-talc-magnesite 2 h after the injection, to (3) quartz-magnesite (48 h after injection), and (4) metastable olivine-magnesite (623 h after injection) until the experiment was terminated. Inspection of the solid reaction products revealed the presence of serpentine, magnesite, minor talc, and magnetite, in addition to relict olivine. Although quartz was saturated over a short segment of the experiment, it was not found in the solid reaction products. A marked and rapid change in fluid chemistry suggests that serpentinization ceased and precipitation of magnesite initiated immediately after the injection. A sharp decrease in pH after the injection promoted the dissolution of brucite and olivine, which liberated SiO2(a q) and dissolved Mg. Dissolved Mg was efficiently removed from the solution via magnesite precipitation, whereas the formation of talc was relatively sluggish. This process accounts for an increase in aSiO2(a q) to quartz saturation shortly after the injection of the CO2-rich fluid. Molecular dihydrogen (H2(a q)) was generated during serpentinization of olivine by oxidation of ferrous iron before the injection; however, no additional H2(a q) was generated after the injection. Speciation calculations suggest a strong affinity for the formation of methane (CH4(a q)) at the expense of CO2(a q) and H2(a q) after the injection, but increased CH4(a q) formation was not observed. These findings suggest that kinetically fast mineral carbonation dominates over sluggish CH4(a q) formation in mildly reducing serpentinization systems affected by injection of CO2-rich fluids.

TI  - Large scale disposal of waste sulfur: From sulfide fuels to sulfate sequestration
AB  - Petroleum industries produce more byproduct sulfur than the market can absorb. As a consequence, most sulfur mines around the world have closed down, large stocks of yellow sulfur have piled up near remote operations, and growing amounts of toxic H2S are disposed of in the subsurface. Unless sulfur demand drastically increases or thorough disposal practices are developed, byproduct sulfur will persist as a chemical waste problem on the scale of 107Â tons per year. We review industrial practices, salient sulfur chemistry, and the geochemical cycle to develop sulfur management concepts at the appropriate scale. We contend that the environmentally responsible disposal of sulfur would involve conversion to sulfuric acid followed by chemical neutralization with equivalent amounts of base, which common alkaline rocks can supply cheaply. The resulting sulfate salts are benign and suitable for brine injection underground or release to the ocean, where they would cause minimal disturbance to ecosystems. Sequestration costs can be recouped by taking advantage of the fuel-grade thermal energy released in the process of oxidizing reduced compounds and sequestering the products. Sulfate sequestration can eliminate stockpiles and avert the proliferation of enriched H2S stores underground while providing plenty of carbon-free energy to hydrocarbon processing.

TI  - In situ carbonation of peridotite for CO2 storage
AB  - The rate of natural carbonation of tectonically exposed mantle peridotite during weathering and low-temperature alteration can be enhanced to develop a significant sink for atmospheric CO2. Natural carbonation of peridotite in the Samail ophiolite, an uplifted slice of oceanic crust and upper mantle in the Sultanate of Oman, is surprisingly rapid. Carbonate veins in mantle peridotite in Oman have an average C-14 age of approximate to 26,000 years, and are not 30-95 million years old as previously believed. These data and reconnaissance mapping show that approximate to 10(4) to 10(5) tons per year of atmospheric CO2 are converted to solid carbonate minerals via peridotite weathering in Oman. Peridotite carbonation can be accelerated via drilling, hydraulic fracture, input of purified CO2 at elevated pressure, and, in particular, increased temperature at depth. After an initial heating step, CO2 pumped at 25 or 30 degrees C can be heated by exothermic carbonation reactions that sustain high temperature and rapid reaction rates at depth with little expenditure of energy. In situ carbonation of peridotite could consume > 1 billion tons of CO2 per year in Oman alone, affording a low-cost, safe, and permanent method to capture and store atmospheric CO2.

TI  - Affordable CO2 negative emission through hydrogen from biomass, ocean liming, and CO2 storage
AB  - A new process to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, by combining commercial industrial technologies with ocean liming and CO2 storage, is presented. The process aims to overcome the limiting factors of other negative emission technologies (cost and energy requirements, potential competition for land and freshwater) while simultaneously addressing the problem of ocean acidification. The overall proposed process is based on the following: (a) a gasifier where the biomass is converted to syngas; (b) a thermal steam reformer working at high temperature where the hydrocarbons and tar oils are converted to hydrogen (H-2) and carbon monoxide (CO); (c) a kiln to produce Ca(OH)(2) (slaked lime) from limestone by using the enthalpy of the hot syngas; (d) the spreading, by means of vessels, of the slaked lime into the seawater to achieve ocean liming; (e) the delivery of syngas to a water gas shift reactor producing CO2 and H-2 that are then separated; (f) the final storage of all CO2 produced in the process; (g) the use of H-2, being the valuable by-product of the whole process, for decarbonized energy production as well as for ammonia synthesis, offsetting part of the production cost, thus generating ``low-cost{''} negative emissions. The mass and energy balances show that the total atmospheric CO2 removed by the process is 2.6 ton per ton of biomass used. By adding an estimated 0.43 ton avoided-thanks to the use of produced H-2-the overall CO2 benefit of the process increases to 3.0 ton per ton of biomass. A preliminary cost analysis resulted in an average levelized cost of 98 \$ per ton of CO2 removed; when considering the revenues from the produced energy, the cost falls to 64 \$/tCO(2). The higher efficiency in carbon removal obtained allows to reduce the amount of biomass required by BECCS (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage) to achieve negative emissions, and thanks to the valuable H-2 produced it lowers the costs of CO2 removal from the atmosphere.

TI  - Regulation of atmospheric CO2 by deep-sea sediments in an Earth system model
AB  - We have extended the GENIE-1 Earth system model to include a representation of sedimentary stratigraphy and the preservation of biogenic carbonates delivered to the ocean floor. This has enabled us to take a novel approach in diagnosing modern marine carbon cycling: assimilating observation of the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) content of deep-sea sediments with an ensemble Kalman filter. The resulting calibrated model predicts a mean surface sediment content (32.5 wt%) close to the observed value (34.8 wt%), and a global burial rate of CaCO3 in deep sea sediments of 0.121 PgC yr-1, in line with recent budget estimates of 0.10-0.14 PgC yr-1. We employ the GENIE-1 model in quantifying the multimillennial-scale fate of fossil fuel CO2 emitted to the atmosphere. In the absence of any interaction between ocean and sediments, an equilibrium partitioning of CO2 is reached within âˆ¼1000 years of emissions ceasing, with 34% (645 ppm) remaining in the atmosphere out of a total fossil fuel burn of 4173 PgC. An additional 12% of CO2 emissions (223 ppm) are sequestered as bicarbonate ions (HCO3) by reaction with deep-sea carbonates ("seafloor CaCO3 neutralization") on a timescale of âˆ¼1.7 ka. Excess of carbonate weathering on land over deep-sea burial results in a further net transformation of 14% of CO2 emissions (261 ppm) into HCO3- ("terrestrial CaCO3 neutralization") on a timescale of âˆ¼8.3 ka. We have also assessed the importance of a changing climate in modulating the stabilization of atmospheric CO2 through ocean-sediment interaction. Increased ocean stratification suppresses particulate organic carbon export, which in turn enhances seafloor CaCO3 preservation. The resulting reduction in the sequestration of fossil fuel CO2 represents a new positive feedback on millennial-scale climate change. Copyrigbt 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.

TI  - Geochemical carbon dioxide removal potential of Spain
AB  - Many countries have made pledges to reduce CO2 emissions over the upcoming decades to meet the Paris Agreement targets of limiting warming to no &gt;1.5 Â°C, aiming for net zero by mid-century. To achieve national reduction targets, there is a further need for CO2 removal (CDR) approaches on a scale of millions of tonnes, necessitating a better understanding of feasible methods. One approach that is gaining attention is geochemical CDR, encompassing (1) in-situ injection of CO2-rich gases into Ca and Mg-rich rocks for geological storage by mineral carbonation, (2) ex-situ ocean alkalinity enhancement, enhanced weathering and mineral carbonation of alkaline-rich materials, and (3) electrochemical separation processes. In this context, Spain may host a notionally high geochemical CDR capacity thanks to its varied geological setting, including extensive mafic-ultramafic and carbonate rocks. However, pilot schemes and large-scale strategies for CDR implementation are presently absent in-country, partly due to gaps in current knowledge and lack of attention paid by regulatory bodies. Here, we identify possible materials, localities and avenues for future geochemical CDR research and implementation strategies within Spain. This study highlights the kilotonne to million tonne scale CDR options for Spain over the rest of the century, with attention paid to chemically and mineralogically appropriate materials, suitable implementation sites and potential strategies that could be followed. Mafic, ultramafic and carbonate rocks, mine tailings, fly ashes, slag by-products, desalination brines and ceramic wastes hosted and produced in Spain are of key interest, with industrial, agricultural and coastal areas providing opportunities to launch pilot schemes. Though there are obstacles to reaching the maximum CDR potential, this study helps to identify focused targets that will facilitate overcoming such barriers. The CDR potential of Spain warrants dedicated investigations to achieve the highest possible CDR to make valuable contributions to national reduction targets. Â© 2022 The Authors

TI  - Salinity affects microbial activity and soil organic matter content in tidal wetlands
AB  - Climate change-associated sea level rise is expected to cause saltwater intrusion into many historically freshwater ecosystems. Of particular concern are tidal freshwater wetlands, which perform several important ecological functions including carbon sequestration. To predict the impact of saltwater intrusion in these environments, we must first gain a better understanding of how salinity regulates decomposition in natural systems. This study sampled eight tidal wetlands ranging from freshwater to oligohaline (0-2 ppt) in four rivers near the Chesapeake Bay (Virginia). To help isolate salinity effects, sites were selected to be highly similar in terms of plant community composition and tidal influence. Overall, salinity was found to be strongly negatively correlated with soil organic matter content (OM\%) and C:N, but unrelated to the other studied environmental parameters (pH, redox, and above- and below-ground plant biomass). Partial correlation analysis, controlling for these environmental covariates, supported direct effects of salinity on the activity of carbon-degrading extracellular enzymes (-1, 4-glucosidase, 1, 4--cellobiosidase, -D-xylosidase, and phenol oxidase) as well as alkaline phosphatase, using a per unit OM basis. As enzyme activity is the putative rate-limiting step in decomposition, enhanced activity due to salinity increases could dramatically affect soil OM accumulation. Salinity was also found to be positively related to bacterial abundance (qPCR of the 16S rRNA gene) and tightly linked with community composition (T-RFLP). Furthermore, strong relationships were found between bacterial abundance and/or composition with the activity of specific enzymes (1, 4--cellobiosidase, arylsulfatase, alkaline phosphatase, and phenol oxidase) suggesting salinity's impact on decomposition could be due, at least in part, to its effect on the bacterial community. Together, these results indicate that salinity increases microbial decomposition rates in low salinity wetlands, and suggests that these ecosystems may experience decreased soil OM accumulation, accretion, and carbon sequestration rates even with modest levels of saltwater intrusion.

TI  - The recycling and reuse of steelmaking slags â€” A review
AB  - Large volumes of slags are formed as by-products during the refinement of pig iron by basic oxygen steelmaking or electric arc furnace steelmaking. In order to lower the environmental impact of the steel industry and ensure its economic sustainability, there have been significant studies finding the ways to recycle by-products. The formation, composition and physical properties of steel making slag are discussed with regard to the problems associated with its reuse. The volume instability caused by free lime exposure to moisture means that the reuse of steelmaking slag is often limited as many potential applications, and the leaching behavior of steelmaking slag is important for environmental considerations. Land-based applications that have been demonstrated include replacing natural sand as aggregate in cement, which may be combined with the CO2 sequestration properties. Steel slag shows use as a liming material (when spread over acidic soils to help to raise the pH to a more neutral level) and to enhance the physical properties of soft soils. Potential benefits to the marine environment is due to high porosity and large surface area, making slags ideal for coral reef repair (e.g., overcoming coral bleaching) and replacement (e.g., artificial reef to promote growth of green marine plants and seagrass), as well as a growth promoter for seaweed and phytoplankton that are microscopic organisms that are an essential component of ecosystems in oceans around the world. The chemistry of steelmaking slag also makes it a contender for adsorption of H2S and metalloids from marine environments. Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Spatial Distribution and Ecological Risk Assessment of Heavy Metals in the Sediment of a Tropical Mangrove Wetland on Hainan Island, China
AB  - Mangroves have a high ecological service value and play an important role in achieving carbon neutrality. However, mangrove wetland soil quality is constantly being affected, and the ecological services provided are gradually declining due to the threat of various pollutants, especially heavy metal pollution. Exploring the sources and ecological risks of heavy metals in mangrove sediments will be helpful in improving mangrove protection. In 2020, sediments were collected from terrestrial and aquatic areas of Dongzhai Harbor mangrove wetland in Hainan, China, and were analyzed for the concentrations of nine heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Ni, Zn, Co). The results showed that there were obvious spatial distributions of heavy metals in sediments. The high concentrations of heavy metals occurred largely in terrestrial areas and in 0-20 cm of the sediment surface layer. Correlation analysis and cluster analysis indicated that As mainly originated from ships and aquaculture in the harbor waters, Cd and Hg from agriculture, Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn and Co from the weathering of parent rocks, and Pb from soot emitted from metal smelters and automobile exhaust. The individual potential ecological risk index (E-r(i)) indicated that contaminating elements were mainly Cd and Hg. The potential ecological risk index (RI) and multiple probable effect concentrations quality (mPECQs) indicated that the areas with high heavy metal concentration and the 0-20 cm range of sediment surface layer were more susceptible to heavy metal contamination. Although there were no obvious ecological risks in the area, these results could facilitate the understanding of the distribution of heavy metal pollution in mangroves and provide information to achieve sustainable development of mangroves.

TI  - Relative impacts of global changes and regional watershed changes on the inorganic carbon balance of the Chesapeake Bay
AB  - The Chesapeake Bay is a large coastal-plain estuary that has experienced considerable anthropogenic change over the past century. At the regional scale, land-use change has doubled the nutrient input from rivers and led to an increase in riverine carbon and alkalinity. The bay has also experienced global changes, including the rise of atmospheric temperature and CO2. Here we seek to understand the relative impact of these changes on the inorganic carbon balance of the bay between the early 1900s and the early 2000s. We use a linked land-estuarine-ocean modeling system that includes both inorganic and organic carbon and nitrogen cycling. Sensitivity experiments are performed to isolate the effect of changes in (1) atmospheric CO2, (2) temperature, (3) riverine nitrogen loading and (4) riverine carbon and alkalinity loading. Specifically, we find that over the past century global changes have increased ingassing by roughly the same amount (âˆ¼ 30 Gg-C yr-1) as has the increased riverine loadings. While the former is due primarily to increases in atmospheric CO2, the latter results from increased net ecosystem production that enhances ingassing. Interestingly, these increases in ingassing are partially mitigated by increased temperatures and increased riverine carbon and alkalinity inputs, both of which enhance outgassing. Overall, the bay has evolved over the century to take up more atmospheric CO2 and produce more organic carbon. These results suggest that over the past century, changes in riverine nutrient loads have played an important role in altering coastal carbon budgets, but that ongoing global changes have also substantially affected coastal carbonate chemistry.

TI  - Mitigation of Extreme Ocean Anoxic Event Conditions by Organic Matter Sulfurization
AB  - Past occurrences of widespread and severe anoxia in the ocean have frequently been associated with abundant geological evidence for free hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the water column, so-called euxinic conditions. Free H2S may react with, and modify, the chemical structure of organic matter settling through the water column and in marine sediments, with hypothesized implications for carbon sequestration. Here, taking the example of Ocean Anoxic Event 2, we explore the potential impact of organic matter sulfurization on marine carbon and oxygen cycling by means of Earth system modeling. Our model experiments demonstrate that rapid sulfurization (ksulfâ‰¥ = 105Â Mâˆ’1Â yearâˆ’1) of organic matter in the water column can drive a more than 30% enhancement of organic carbon preservation and burial in marine sediments and hence help accelerate climate cooling and Ocean Anoxic Event 2 recovery. As a consequence of organic matter sulfurization, we also find that H2S can be rapidly scavenged and the euxinic ocean volume reduced by up to 80%â€”helping reoxygenate the ocean as well as reducing toxic H2S emissions to the atmosphere, with potential implications for the kill mechanism at the end-Permian. Finally, we find that the addition of organic matter sulfurization induces a series of additional feedbacks, including further atmospheric CO2 drawdown and ocean reoxygenation by the creation of a previously unrecognized net source of alkalinity to the ocean as H2S is scavenged and buried.

TI  - The Availability of Limestone and Other Raw Materials for Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement
AB  - The work assesses the availability and localizations of different raw materials suitable for ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE), like limestone, olivine, magnesite and brucite, since several billion tons of rocky materials are needed to achieve meaningful results for carbon sequestration through OAE. Resources of carbonates are immense and widespread around all continents. Availability of pure carbonates is still very large (outcrop area 4.1 million km2) and is not a constraint for the large-scale development of OAE. Outcrops of pure carbonates within 10Â km from the coastline and below bare ground or scrub/shrub, preferred for the logistics of exploitation, account for about 70,000Â km2, and could provide about 5,000Â Gt of limestone. These values increase by a factor of 3 and 8 within 50 and 100Â km from the coastline, respectively. Potential resources of olivine, less easily identifiable from the geological data, are estimated in the order of a few hundred billion tons and could provide only a minor contribution to ocean-based carbon removal strategies. A comparison with the current level of world extraction of mineral raw materials is also provided. The annual production of limestone, estimated to be more than 6.6Â Gt from deposits scattered all around the world, is about 9% of the world production of mineral raw materials (around 44Â Gt yrâˆ’1), and is of the same order of magnitude as coal (7.3Â Gt yrâˆ’1). The annual productions of magnesite (29Â Mt yrâˆ’1), olivine (8.4Â Mt yrâˆ’1) and brucite (1.5Â Mt yrâˆ’1) are two orders of magnitude lower. Â© 2022 The Authors.

TI  - An overview of CO2 mitigation options for global warming - Emphasizing CO2 sequestration options
AB  - CO2 mitigation options have been overviewed from an engineering point of view. There have been proposed a number of mitigation options, which can be divided into three categories; 1. reduction of energy intensity; 2. reduction of carbon intensity; 3. carbon sequestration. In this review paper, various mitigation options are reviewed focusing on the carbon sequestration options. A reduction in energy intensity is essentially an energy saving. A reduction in carbon intensity could be achieved by switching to energy resources with lower carbon contents. Based on the 2001 IPCC report, the mitigation potential related to energy intensity is estimated at 1,900-2,600 Mt-C/year in 2010, and 3,600-5,050 Mt-C/year in 2020, including other greenhouse gas equivalents. There are additional benefits in implementing these options; they are economically beneficial, and have no associated harmful effects. The carbon sequestration options can be divided into two categories; the enhancement of the natural sinking rates of CO2, and a direct discharge of anthropogenic CO2. The relevant sequestration options in the first category include terrestrial sequestration by vegetation, ocean sequestration by fertilization, and an enhancement of the rock weathering process. In the direct discharge options, the CO2 produced from large point sources, such as thermal power stations, would be captured and separated, then transported and injected either into the ocean or underground. Although the sequestration options are less beneficial in terms of cost per unit CO, reduction compared to other options, technical developments in sequestration options are necessary for the following reasons; 1. A huge potential capacity for carbon sequestration, 2. carbon sequestration enables a continuous use of fossil fuels, which is unavoidable at the moment, before switching to renewable energy sources. Each sequestration option has advantages and disadvantages in terms of capacity, cost, the time scale of the sequestration, the stability of sequestered CO2, and additional environmental impacts, which depend on the location, time, and amount of sequestration. Thus, reliable evaluations of the mitigation efficiency are essential for each sequestration option upon implementation.

TI  - Direct Air Capture of CO2 through Carbonate Alkalinity Generated by Phytoplankton Nitrate Assimilation
AB  - Despite the consensus that keeping global temperature rise within 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial level by 2100 reduces the chance for climate change to reach the point of no return, the newest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report warns that the existing commitment of greenhouse gas emission reduction is only enough to contain the warming to 3-4 degrees C by 2100. The harsh reality not only calls for speedier deployment of existing CO2 reduction technologies but demands development of more cost-efficient carbon removal strategies. Here we report an ocean alkalinity-based CO2 sequestration scheme, taking advantage of proton consumption during nitrate assimilation by marine photosynthetic microbes, and the ensuing enhancement of seawater CO2 absorption. Benchtop experiments using a native marine phytoplankton community confirmed pH elevation from similar to 8.2 to similar to 10.2 in seawater, within 3-5 days of microbial culture in nitrate-containing media. The alkaline condition was able to sustain at continued nutrient supply but reverted to normalcy (pH similar to.2-8.4) once the biomass was removed. Measurements of delta C-13 in the dissolved inorganic carbon revealed a significant atmospheric CO2 contribution to the carbonate alkalinity in the experimental seawater, confirming the occurrence of direct carbon dioxide capture from the air. Thermodynamic calculation shows a theoretical carbon removal rate of similar to 0.13 mol CO2/L seawater, if the seawater pH is allowed to decrease from 10.2 to 8.2. A cost analysis (using a standard bioreactor wastewater treatment plant as a template for CO2 trapping, and a modified moving-bed biofilm reactor for nitrate recycling) indicated that a 1 Mt CO2/year operation is able to perform at a cost of similar to\$40/tCO(2), 2.5-5.5 times cheaper than that offered by any of the currently available direct air capture technologies, and more in line with the price of \$25-30/tCO(2) suggested for rapid deployment of large-scale CCS systems.

TI  - Co-location of air capture, subseafloor CO2 sequestration, and energy production on the Kerguelen plateau
AB  - Reducing atmospheric CO2 using a combination of air capture and offshore geological storage can address technical and policy concerns with climate mitigation. Because CO2 mixes rapidly in the atmosphere, air capture could operate anywhere and in principle reduce CO2 to preindustrial levels. We investigate the Kerguelen plateau in the Indian Ocean, which offers steady wind resources, vast subseafloor storage capacities, and minimal risk of economic damages or human inconvenience and harm. The efficiency of humidity swing driven air capture under humid and windy conditions is tested in the laboratory. Powered by wind, we estimate âˆ¼75 Mt CO2/yr could be collected using air capture and sequestered below seafloor or partially used for synfuel. Our analysis suggests that Kerguelen offers a remote and environmentally secure location for CO2 sequestration using renewable energy. Regional reservoirs could hold over 1500 Gt CO2, sequestering a large fraction of 21st century emissions. Â© 2013 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Research Status and Application Potential of CO2 Mineralization [CO2çŸ¿åŒ–ç ”ç©¶çŽ°çŠ¶åŠåº”ç”¨æ½œåŠ›]
AB  - The sharp rise of carbon dioxide concentration has become a very serious problem, so reducing the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration has become a top priority. Although the potential of marine and geological sequestration is huge, the negative impact of these schemes can not be underestimated. As a new emission reduction scheme, carbon dioxide mineralization can not only fix atmospheric carbon dioxide, generate carbonate products with industrial added value, but also achieve environmental friendliness. Raw materials that can be used for mineralization include natural calcium-rich, magnesium silicate minerals, industrial alkaline waste solids, liquids, magnesium chloride resources in salt lakes, etc. The methods of mineralization are also different. Although the mechanism of how the weathering of silicate rocks can control the long-term climate change has not been determined, there is a consensus that the weathering process has the potential to fix a large amount of CO2. The research on the mineralized CO2 of tailing containing a lot of silicate minerals is a hot spot at present. This paper introduces the research status of mineralized CO2 of tailing and the mineralized potential of several important tailing minerals. Â© 2020, Editorial Department of Earth Science.

TI  - Negative emissions-Part 1: Research landscape and synthesis
AB  - With the Paris Agreement's ambition of limiting climate change to well below 2 degrees C, negative emission technologies (NETs) have moved into the limelight of discussions in climate science and policy. Despite several assessments, the current knowledge on NETs is still diffuse and incomplete, but also growing fast. Here, we synthesize a comprehensive body of NETs literature, using scientometric tools and performing an in-depth assessment of the quantitative and qualitative evidence therein. We clarify the role of NETs in climate change mitigation scenarios, their ethical implications, as well as the challenges involved in bringing the various NETs to the market and scaling them up in time. There are six major findings arising from our assessment: first, keeping warming below 1.5 degrees C requires the large-scale deployment of NETs, but this dependency can still be kept to a minimum for the 2 degrees C warming limit. Second, accounting for economic and biophysical limits, we identify relevant potentials for all NETs except ocean fertilization. Third, any single NET is unlikely to sustainably achieve the large NETs deployment observed in many 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C mitigation scenarios. Yet, portfolios of multiple NETs, each deployed at modest scales, could be invaluable for reaching the climate goals. Fourth, a substantial gap exists between the upscaling and rapid diffusion of NETs implied in scenarios and progress in actual innovation and deployment. If NETs are required at the scales currently discussed, the resulting urgency of implementation is currently neither reflected in science nor policy. Fifth, NETs face severe barriers to implementation and are only weakly incentivized so far. Finally, we identify distinct ethical discourses relevant for NETs, but highlight the need to root them firmly in the available evidence in order to render such discussions relevant in practice.

TI  - Buffered accelerated weathering of limestone for storing CO2: Chemical background
AB  - We present an evolution of the Accelerated Weathering of Limestone (AWL) method to store CO2 in seawater in the form of bicarbonates. Buffered Accelerated Weathering of Limestone (BAWL) is designed to produce a buffered ionic solution, at seawater pH, which derives from the reaction between a CO2 stream and a powder of micron-sized calcium carbonate particles in a long tubular reactor. Addition of calcium hydroxide to buffer the unreacted CO2 before the discharge in seawater is also provided. BAWL aims to overcome the main limitations of AWL, such as the high amount of water needed, the large size of the reactor, the risk of CO2 degassing back into the atmosphere, if the ionic solution is released into shallow waters, as well as the induced seawater acidification. This paper presents the chemical background of the technology and evaluates its feasibility by considering the chemical equilibria in the different phases of the process. The CO2 emitted for limestone calcination leads to a 24% CO2 penalty; a preliminary cost analysis assesses a storage cost of 100 â‚¬ per tonne of CO2 from an external source. It finally discusses the main features to be considered for the design at the industrial scale. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Soundings The Aspen Instituteâ€™s Guidance for Ocean-based Carbon Dioxide Removal Projects
AB  - As a number of studies in recent years have concluded, the temperature objectives of the Paris Agreement can likely only be effectuated at this point by a combination of aggressive decarbonization of the global economy AND large-scale deployment of so-called carbon dioxide removal (CDR) options. The lionâ€™s share of the early research on CDR approaches focused on terrestrial options, such as afforestation/reforestation, regenerative agriculture, bioenergy and carbon capture with sequestration, direct air capture, and enhanced mineral weathering. However, growing concerns about the sustainability of many of ALAN LUNTZ these approaches at large-scale deployment, as well as cost concerns and high energy demands in the case of some options, have led to an increasing focus on the potential role of ocean-based carbon removal, many of which are discussed in this special issue.

TI  - Simulated effects of interactions between ocean acidification, marine organism calcification, and organic carbon export on ocean carbon and oxygen cycles
AB  - Ocean acidification caused by oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) tends to suppress the calcification of some marine organisms. This reduced calcification then enhances surface ocean alkalinity and increases oceanic CO2 uptake, a process that is termed calcification feedback. On the other hand, decreased calcification also reduces the export flux of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), potentially reducing CaCO3-bound organic carbon export flux and CO2 uptake, a process that is termed ballast feedback. In this study, we incorporate a range of different parameterizations of the links between organic carbon export, calcification, and ocean acidification into an Earth system model, in order to quantify the long-term effects on oceanic CO2 uptake that result from calcification and ballast feedbacks. We utilize an intensive CO2 emission scenario to drive the model in which an estimated fossil fuel resource of 5000 Pg C is burnt out over the course of just a few centuries. Simulated results show that, in the absence of both calcification and ballast feedbacks, by year 3500, accumulated oceanic CO2 uptake is 2041 Pg C. Inclusion of calcification feedback alone increases the simulated uptake by 629 Pg C (31%), while the inclusion of both calcification and ballast feedbacks increase simulated uptake by 449â€“498 Pg C (22â€“24%), depending on the parameter values used in the ballast feedback scheme. These results indicate that ballast effect counteracts calcification effect in oceanic CO2 uptake. Ballast effect causes more organic carbon to accumulate and decompose in the upper ocean, which in turn leads to decreased oxygen concentration in the upper ocean and increased oxygen at depths. By year 2600, the inclusion of ballast effect would decrease oxygen concentration by 11% at depth of ca. 200 m in tropics. Our study highlights the potentially critical effects of interactions between ocean acidification, marine organism calcification, and CaCO3-bound organic carbon export on the ocean carbon and oxygen cycles.

TI  - Use of aircraft in ocean alkalinity enhancement
AB  - Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) is a proposed Negative Emissions Technology (NET) to remove atmospheric CO2 through the dispersion of alkaline materials (e.g.: calcium hydroxide, slaked lime, SL) into seawater, simultaneously counteracting ocean acidification. This study considers aircraft discharge of SL and its consequent dry deposition, extending to the marine environment a technique used in freshwater. A feasibility analysis assesses potential, costs, benefits, and disadvantages, considering scenarios with different assumptions on aircraft size, discharge height and duration, and wind conditions. Due to the small size of SL particles (median diameter 9 Î¼m), the dispersion from aircraft is highly enhanced by wind drift; the smallest SL particles may drift thousands of kilometres, especially if discharged from elevated altitudes. This could pose problems related to powders particles settling on remote lands. Although calcium hydroxide maximum concentration into water (from 0.01 to 82 mg Lâˆ’1) is for almost all the scenarios lower than the most stringent threshold for the ecosystem impacts on a 96-h exposure, the ecologically sensitive sea surface microlayer (SML) should be considered in detail. The high CO2 emissions of the Landing to Take-Off Cycle (LTO) of the aircraft and their limited payload lead to a significant CO2 penalty, ranging in analysed scenarios between 28% and 77% of the CO2 removal potential; very fast discharge could reduce the penalty to 11% - 32%. Preliminary cost analysis shows that the cost of the SL discharge through aircraft is high, between â‚¬ 30 and â‚¬ 1846 per ton of CO2 removed (neglecting the lime cost), substantially higher than the cost for discharge by surface vessels resulting from previous studies, which restricts the practical use of this strategy.

TI  - Biochar from commercially cultivated seaweed for soil amelioration
AB  - Seaweed cultivation is a high growth industry that is primarily targeted at human food and hydrocolloid markets. However, seaweed biomass also offers a feedstock for the production of nutrient-rich biochar for soil amelioration. We provide the first data of biochar yield and characteristics from intensively cultivated seaweeds (Saccharina, Undaria and Sargassum - brown seaweeds, and Gracilaria, Kappaphycus and Eucheuma - red seaweeds). While there is some variability in biochar properties as a function of the origin of seaweed, there are several defining and consistent characteristics of seaweed biochar, in particular a relatively low C content and surface area but high yield, essential trace elements (N, P and K) and exchangeable cations (particularly K). The pH of seaweed biochar ranges from neutral (7) to alkaline (11), allowing for broad-spectrum applications in diverse soil types. We find that seaweed biochar is a unique material for soil amelioration that is consistently different to biochar derived from ligno-cellulosic feedstock. Blending of seaweed and ligno-cellulosic biochar could provide a soil ameliorant that combines a high fixed C content with a mineral-rich substrate to enhance crop productivity.

TI  - Ex situ CO2 mineralization using reactive species
AB  - While geologic sequestration method may be used to store large volumes of CO2, it involves two distinct steps, i.e., capture and storage, with the former being a more costly step. Also, finding suitable storage sites, pumping supercritical C O2, safekeeping it underground, and handling of saline water discharges could impede its deployment. C O2 mineralization, on the other hand, can be a single-step process and the product can be stored permanently. In some cases, the product can be utilized as construction materials which will defray the cost for C O2 mineralization. The idea of C O2 mineralization was first proposed by Seifritz in 19901. After that, many researchers investigated ex situ C O2 mineralization by reaction of C O2 with natural silicate minerals such as serpentine, olivine and wollastonite, forming geologically stable carbonate minerals. Lackner et al. were the first to conduct significant studies. They firstly studied direct dry carbonation and found that the reaction was too slow2, 3. Then they investigated a well-known acid extraction route, where magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) was extracted from silicate minerals using hydrochloric acid (HCl) The energy cost in the dehydration step needed for HCl recovery was too high 4-6. Researchers at Albany Research Center (ARC) studied an alternative process 7-11, namely direct aqueous mineral carbonation, where gaseous C O2 directly reacts with fine particle-sized minerals in suspension in an autoclave. This process was uneconomical due to the substantial energy required for the activation of silicate minerals and the large scale of associated mining operations to produce the needed ore. Twenty years of research and development (R&amp;D) work addressing C O2 mineralization using silicate minerals has failed to produce an economical technology that could be applied on a large-scale. The main limitation was the high energy cost required for the extraction or activation of silicate minerals. To get around this problem, reactive species such as Mg2+, Ca2+ and Fe 2+ ions could be used in place of silicate minerals to react with C O2, which is the subject of the present work. The precipitation of carbonates from reactive cations offers much faster kinetics than reacting with silica minerals where cations are bound in a silicate structure. The present work focused on using Mg2+ ions because Mg-carbonate has a higher proportion of C O2 than Ca- or Fe- carbonate due to the lower molecular weight of Mg and seawater contains a much higher concentration of Mg2+ ion than Ca2+ and Fe2+ ions. In the present work, we have explored the possibility of reacting C O2 with reactive species that are already present in waters such as produced water from oil and gas industries and sea water. Many of the species present in these waters (e.g., Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions) are reactive without or with minimal activation energies, thereby reducing both capital and operating costs. Recognizing that sea water represents the single largest reservoir of the reactive species, we have conducted mineralization experiments using 1,400 mg/L of Mg2+ and 400 mg/L of Ca2+ ions which represent average concentrations in sea water. The amounts of these species present in sea water alone are such that we can use these two reactive species for the next 100,000 years at the present level of global C O2 emission (35 Gt/year). Additionally, approximately 70 billion barrels of produced water are currently generated every year all over the world12, of which the U.S. contributes 20 to 30 billion barrels13. About 35% of this water is treated and discharged into surface water bodies-which could be costly. Some of the discharged produced waters have high levels of Mg2+ ions, e.g., brine sample from Oriskany, Pennsylvania contains 2490 mg/L Mg2+ ions 14 and that from Guernsey, Ohio contains 3440 mg/L Mg2+ ions15. The process of C O2 mineralization using reactive species can be used to clean-up the produced water while achieving both capture and storage of C O2, all simultaneously. It was found that Ca 2+ ions react more readily than Mg2+ ions. A series of mineralization experiments were conducted at temperatures in the range of 10 to 40Â°C and the product was characterized to be nesquehonite (MgCO 3â€¢3H2O). During the precipitation process, the Mg2+ ion concentration decreased and solution pH increased as shown in figure 1. The kinetics of mineralization and the %Mg2+ ion utilization varied depending on energy dissipation rate, temperature, pH, and NaCl concentration. The maximum Mg2+ ion utilization we achieved was 86% as shown in figure 1.The activation energy for the formation of nesquehonite was 64.6 kJ/mol, which was determined by using the rate constants at different temperatures shown in figure 2 and Arrhenius plot shown in figure 3. It was found that the activation energy barrier can be readily overcome by simple agitation and heating at slightly elevated temperatures, e.g., 40Â°C. We also conducted thermodynamic calculations to construct the species distribution diagrams, predict the pH of C O2 mineralization, and to predict %Mg ion utilization (or extraction) from sea water. The C O2 mineralization method developed in the present work may lead to a process of extracting magnesium, which is listed as a "near-critical" material in the 2011 DOE Critical Materials Strategy Report. One of the concerns in C O2 mineralization with reactive species may be pH lowering. We have addressed this issue by contacting spent solutions with basic minerals such as limestone and olivine. It was found that in the presence of these minerals the pH rises to the pH of minimum solubility of the buffering mineral. The pH of minimum solubility of limestone is 8.3 and that of olivine is 8.6. Other means of pH neutralization will be discussed.

TI  - Carbon-dioxide Fixation by Artificial Reef Development in Marine Environment using Carbonated Slag Material from Steel Plant
AB  - Carbon dioxide emission into the atmosphere from the major point sources such as coal fired power plants, steel plants, cement industries triggered studies on its green house effects. Mineral carbonation is an option for storage of carbon dioxide in industrial waste materials by converting it into carbonates similar to the end products of natural weathering processes. Present study deals with carbonation of steel slag for carbon dioxide storage and also utilization of the converted carbonates in structures for shore protection. Blast furnace slag and Linz-Donawitz converter slag are subjected to high pressure (>20 bar) and temperatures above 60 degrees C in presence of carbon dioxide in a reactor to convert into carbonate. Laboratory experiments showed encouraging results with a 50\% conversion of less than 75 mu m sized slag into carbonate. Converted carbonates are proposed to be utilized in the development of artificial reefs and the laboratory studies on the behavior of the material in sea water are conducted. Details of the carbonation of steel slag and preparation of structures for artificial reef development are discussed in the paper.

TI  - Experimental and modeling analyzing the biogas upgrading in the microchannel: Carbon dioxide capture by seawater enriched with low-cost waste materials
AB  - There are multiple techniques to enhance the calorific value of biogas by removing impurities, especially carbon dioxide (CO2). This study used a T-shaped microchannel to purify biogas by seawater containing 0.1 wt\% of Iranian modified clinoptilolite zeolite and several precipitates (i.e., water distillation, phosphogypsum, power plant clarifier unit). These additives increase the alkalinity and CO2 absorption ability of seawater. Effects of temperature, liquid flow rate, and biogas flow rate on the CO2 removal efficiency have been investigated. The response surface methodology is also employed to construct a quadratic model to predict the CO2 removal efficiency as a function of these variables. The P-value for all variables was less than 0.05, indicating that all four models were significant. Moreover, according to R2 values ranging from 0.9920 to 0.9997, the experimental CO2 absorption values have acceptable agreement with the model predictions. The maximum CO2 capture by seawater solutions containing zeolite and precipitates of phosphogypsum waste, plant clarifier, and water distillation at 30 degrees C, in a liquid flow rate of 150 ml/h and a gas flow rate of 50 ml/min was 96.85, 96.01, 92.99, and 90.23\%, respectively. The results achieved in this study are essential for the appropriate design of a micro-reactor for biogas upgrading and understanding the effect of operating conditions on its CO2 removal efficiency.

TI  - Synthetic Fluid Inclusions XXIV. In situ Monitoring of the Carbonation of Olivine Under Conditions Relevant to Carbon Capture and Storage Using Synthetic Fluid Inclusion Micro-Reactors: Determination of Reaction Rates
AB  - Ultramafic and mafic rocks are possible targets for CO2 sequestration via mineral carbonation. The determination of reaction kinetics and the factors that control mineralization are important in order to understand and predict how fast injected CO2 will react with host rocks to permanently isolate and store the carbon. Here we present experimental results of olivine carbonation experiments using synthetic fluid inclusions (SFI) as micro-reactors. The micro-reactor technique coupled with non-destructive Raman spectroscopy allows us to monitor the reaction progress in situ and in real time at elevated temperatures (50â€“200Â°C) and pressures (several 10's to a few hundred bars), and quantify the amount of CO2 consumed in the reaction using the Raman CO2 densimeter and mass-balance calculations. Results show a measurable decrease of CO2 density in the fluid inclusions as a result of the reaction between the CO2-bearing seawater-like aqueous solution and olivine. Magnesite formation was observed within hours at â‰¥100Â°C, while at 50Â°C magnesite nucleation and precipitation was only observed after a few weeks. Raman mapping and FIB-SEM analysis confirmed the formation of a non-continuous Si-rich layer on the inclusion wall and the presence of ferroan magnesite as a reaction product. Reaction rates [log J (mol/mâˆ’2 sâˆ’1)] obtained for olivine carbonation range between ~-8.4 at 50Â°C and âˆ’4.7 at 200Â°C, which is sufficiently rapid to be suitable for commercial CO2 injection projects. Reaction rates involving a seawater-like fluid were similar to rates published for high salinity solutions containing NaHCO3, and were faster compared to rates involving solutions with low salinity. Thus, CO2 injection into submarine environments might offer some advantages over CO2 storage in onshore basalts where the pores are likely to be filled with low salinity meteoric water. The application of the synthetic fluid inclusion technique, combined with non-destructive analytical techniques, is a promising tool to monitor rates of fluid-rock reactions in situ and in real time. Here, we have documented its application to experimentally study carbonation reactions in the olivine-H2O-CO2-NaCl-MgCl2 system.

TI  - Multiple timescales for neutralization of fossil fuel CO2
AB  - The long term abiological sinks for anthropogenic CO2 will be dissolution in the oceans and chemical neutralization by reaction with carbonates and basic igneous rocks. We use a detailed ocean / sediment carbon cycle model to simulate the response of the carbonate cycle in the ocean to a range of anthropogenic CO2 release scenarios. CaCO3 will play only a secondary role in buffering the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere because CaCO3 reaction uptake capacity and kinetics are limited by the dynamics of the ocean carbon cycle. Dissolution into ocean water sequesters 70-80% of the CO2 release on a time scale of several hundred years. Chemical neutralization of CO2 by reaction with CaCO3 on the sea floor accounts for another 9-15% decrease in the atmospheric concentration on a time scale of 5.5 - 6.8 kyr. Reaction with CaCO3 on land accounts for another 3-8%, with a time scale of 8.2 kyr. The final equilibrium with CaCO3 leaves 7.5-8% of the CO2 release remaining in the atmosphere. The carbonate chemistry of the oceans in contact with CaCO3 will act to buffer atmospheric CO2 at this higher concentration until the entire fossil fuel CO2 release is consumed by weathering of basic igneous rocks on a time scale of 200 kyr.

TI  - Short-term variability of carbon chemistry in two contrasting seagrass meadows at Dongsha Island: Implications for pH buffering and CO2 sequestration
AB  - The diurnal cycles of carbon chemistry parameters, i.e., dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity (TA), partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)), and pH, were investigated in two hydrodynamically contrasting seagrass meadows at Dongsha Island in the northern South China Sea in August 2015. The results show that the pH and TA were higher and that the pCO(2) was lower in the semi-enclosed inner lagoon (IL) than on the open north shore (NS). The analyses of carbon chemistry parameters vs. dissolved oxygen and TA vs. DIC relationships reveal that the CO2 dynamics was dominated by photosynthesis/respiration (P/R) alone on the NS but by the combined effect of P/R and sedimentary anaerobic pathways in the IL. We suggest that the observed divergent behaviors in carbon chemistry between the two sites could be attributed to differences in hydrodynamic regimes. The less energetic hydrodynamics and longer residence time in the IL would be favorable for the occurrence of sedimentary anaerobic TA generation and the subsequent TA accumulation in the overlying waters. The elevated TA may lead to a pH increase and a pCO(2) decrease, thus providing a buffering effect against ocean acidification (OA) and enhancing atmospheric CO2 sequestration at local scales. The present results demonstrate that hydrodynamic regime may play an important role in regulating biogeochemical processes in seagrass meadows, and thereby modulating their capacities in OA buffering and CO2 uptaking.

TI  - Electrochemical splitting of calcium carbonate to increase solution alkalinity: Implications for mitigation of carbon dioxide and ocean acidity
AB  - Electrochemical splitting of calcium carbonate (e.g., as contained in limestone or other minerals) is explored as a means of forming dissolve hydroxides for absorbing, neutralizing, and storing carbon dioxide, and for restoring, preserving, or enhancing ocean calcification. While essentially insoluble in water, CaCO3 can be dissolved in the presence of the highly acidic anolyte of a water electrolysis cell. The resulting charged constituents, Ca2+ and CO32-, migrate to the cathode and anode, respectively, forming Ca(OH)2 on the one hand and H2CO3 (or H2O and CO2) on the other. By maintaining a pH between 6 and 9, subsequent hydroxide reactions with CO2 primarily produce dissolved calcium bicarbonate, Ca(HCO 3)2aq. Thus, for each mole of CaCO3 split, there can be a net capture of up to 1 mol of CO2. Ca(HCO 3)2aq is thus the carbon sequestrant that can be diluted and stored in the ocean, in natural or artificial surface water reservoirs, or underground. The theoretical work requirement for the reaction is 266 kJ e per net mole CO2 consumed. Even with inefficiencies, a realized net energy expenditure lower than the preceding quantity appears possible considering energy recovery via oxidation of the H2 produced. The net process cost is estimated to be &lt;$100/tonne CO 2 mitigated. An experimental demonstration of the concept is presented, and further implementation issues are discussed.

TI  - Injection of in-situ generated CO2 microbubbles into deep saline aquifers for enhanced carbon sequestration
AB  - Carbon sequestration into deep saline aquifers has been considered a promising technology for mitigating heavy atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. When gaseous CO2 is continuously injected into these aquifers, resident brine near a wellbore area is rapidly evaporated while precipitating significant amounts of salt at pores, thereby damaging the aquifer media unfavorable for subsequent CO2 injection. In addition, the continuous injection of CO2 at a large volume significantly hinders dissolution of CO2 into brine. In this study, we propose a new method of sequential water injection with gaseous CO2 for in-situ generation of micro-sized CO2 bubbles that minimizes the brine drying-out and simultaneously accelerates CO2 dissolution. We observed that, with this method, a partial volume of CO2 dissolves effectively into the co-injected water during pumping, thereby decreasing the rate of brine drying-out at pores. Another benefit of sequential injection is the significantly increased rate of CO2 hydration induced by the large surface-to-volume ratio of tiny bubbles at micro to nanoscale. To further accelerate CO2 hydration, we investigated reactive dynamics of bubble-driven CO2 hydration at different frequencies of sequential injection and pH levels of the solution. Operation at a higher frequency with higher basicity proved to be the most effective in decreasing the bubble size and therefore accelerating CO2 hydration into brine, which is a more feasible CO2 storage plan.

TI  - Permanent Carbon Dioxide Storage into Basalt: The CarbFix Pilot Project, Iceland
AB  - The storage of large volumes of industrial CO2 emissions in deep geological formations is one of the most promising climate mitigation options. The long-term retention time and environmental safety of the CO2 storage are defined by the interaction of the injected CO2 with the reservoir fluids and rocks. Finding a storage solution that is long lasting, thermodynamically stable and environmentally benign would be ideal. Storage of CO2 as solid magnesium or calcium carbonates in basaltic rocks may provide such a long-term and thermodynamically stable solution. Basaltic rocks, which primarily consist of magnesium and calcium silicate minerals, provide alkaline earth metals necessary to form solid carbonates. In nature, the carbonization of basaltic rocks occurs in several well-documented settings, such as in the deep ocean crust, through hydrothermal alteration and through surface weathering. The goal of the CarbFix pilot project is to optimize industrial methods for permanent storage of CO2 in basaltic rocks. The objective is to study the in-situ mineralization of CO2 and its long term fate. The project involves the capture and separation of flue gases at the Hellisheidi Geothermal Power Plant, the transportation and injection of the CO2 gas fully dissolved in water at elevated pressures at a depth between 400 and 800Â m, as well as the monitoring and verification of the storage. A comprehensive reservoir characterization study is on-going prior to the CO2 injection, including soil CO2 flux measurements, geophysical survey and tracer injection tests. Results from the tracer tests show significant tracer dispersion within the target formation, suggesting large surface area for chemical reactions. The large available reservoir volume and surface area in combination with relatively rapid CO2-water-rock reactions in basaltic rocks may allow safe and permanent geologic storage of CO2 on a large scale.

TI  - Engineering challenges of ocean liming
AB  - The relationship between the level of atmospheric CO2 (carbon dioxide) and the impacts of climate change is uncertain, but a safe concentration may be surpassed this century. Therefore, it is necessary to develop technologies that can accelerate CO2 removal from the atmosphere. This paper explores the engineering challenges of a technology that manipulates the carbonate system in seawater by the addition of calcium oxide powder (CaO; lime), resulting in a net sequestration of atmospheric CO2 into the ocean (ocean liming; OL). Every tonne of CO2 sequestered requires between 1.4 and 1.7tof limestone to be crushed, calcined, and distributed. Approximately 1tof CO2 would be created from this activity, of which 80% is a high purity gas (pCO298%) amenable to geological storage. It is estimated that the thermal and electrical energy requirements for OL would be 0.6-5.6and 0.1-1.2GJtCO2-1 captured respectively. A preliminary economic assessment suggests that OL could cost approximately US$72-159t-1 of CO2. The additional CO2 burden of OL makes it a poor alternative to point source mitigation. However, it may provide a means to mitigate some diffuse emissions and reduce atmospheric concentrations. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Harvesting, storing, and converting carbon from the ocean to create a new carbon economy: Challenges and opportunities
AB  - Ever-increasing anthropogenic CO2 emissions have required us to develop carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies, and in order to address climate change, these options should be at scale. In addition to engineered systems of CO2 capture from power plants and chemical processes, there are emerging approaches that include the Earth (i.e., air, Earth, and ocean) within its system boundary. Since oceans constitute the largest natural sink of CO2, technologies that can enhance carbon storage in the ocean are highly desired. Here, we discuss alkalinity enhancement and biologically inspired CO2 hydration reactions that can shift the equilibrium of ocean water to pump more carbon into this natural sink. Further, we highlight recent work that can harvest and convert CO2 captured by the ocean into chemicals, fuels, and materials using renewable energy such as off-shore wind. Through these emerging and innovative technologies, organic and inorganic carbon from ocean-based solutions can replace fossil-derived carbon and create a new carbon economy. It is critical to develop these ocean-based CCUS technologies without unintended environmental or ecological consequences, which will create a new engineered carbon cycle that is in harmony with the Earthâ€™s system.

TI  - Potential for large-scale CO2 removal via enhanced rock weathering with croplands
AB  - Enhanced silicate rock weathering (ERW), deployable with croplands, has potential use for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (CDR), which is now necessary to mitigate anthropogenic climate change1. ERW also has possible co-benefits for improved food and soil security, and reduced ocean acidification2â€“4. Here we use an integrated performance modelling approach to make an initial techno-economic assessment for 2050, quantifying how CDR potential and costs vary among nations in relation to business-as-usual energy policies and policies consistent with limiting future warming to 2 degrees Celsius5. China, India, the USA and Brazil have great potential to help achieve average global CDR goals of 0.5 to 2 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year with extraction costs of approximately US$80â€“180 per tonne of CO2. These goals and costs are robust, regardless of future energy policies. Deployment within existing croplands offers opportunities to align agriculture and climate policy. However, success will depend upon overcoming political and social inertia to develop regulatory and incentive frameworks. We discuss the challenges and opportunities of ERW deployment, including the potential for excess industrial silicate materials (basalt mine overburden, concrete, and iron and steel slag) to obviate the need for new mining, as well as uncertainties in soil weathering rates and landâ€“ocean transfer of weathered products.

TI  - Effect of a controlled sub-seabed release of CO2 on the biogeochemistry of shallow marine sediments, their pore waters, and the overlying water column
AB  - The potential for leakage of CO2 from a storage reservoir into the overlying marine sediments and into the water column and the impacts on benthic ecosystems are major challenges associated with carbon capture and storage (CCS) in subseafloor reservoirs. We have conducted a field-scale controlled CO2 release experiment in shallow, unconsolidated marine sediments, and documented the changes to the chemical composition of the sediments, their pore waters and overlying water column before, during and up to 1 year after the 37-day long CO2 release. Increased levels of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were detected in the pore waters close to the sediment-seawater interface in sediments sampled closest to the subsurface injection point within 5 weeks of the start of the CO2 release. Highest DIC concentrations (28.8 mmol L-1, compared to background levels of 2.4 mmol L-1) were observed 6 days after the injection had stopped. The high DIC pore waters have high total alkalinity, and low delta C-13(DIC) values (-20 parts per thousand., compared to a background value of -2 parts per thousand), due to the dissolution of the injected CO2 (delta C-13=-26.6 parts per thousand.). The high DIC pore waters have enhanced concentrations of metals (including Ca, Fe, Mn) and dissolved silicon, relative to non-D1C enriched pore waters, indicating that dissolution of injected CO2 promotes dissolution of carbonate and silicate minerals. However, in this experiment, the pore water metal concentrations did not exceed levels considered to be harmful to the environment. The spatial extent of the impact of the injected CO2 in the sediments and pore waters was restricted to an area within 25 m of the injection point, and no impact was observed in the overlying water column. Concentrations of all pore water constituents returned to background values within 18 days after the CO2 injection was stopped. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The Carbon Dioxide Removal Model Intercomparison Project (CDRMIP): rationale and experimental protocol for CMIP6
AB  - The recent IPCC reports state that continued anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are changing the climate, threatening ``severe, pervasive and irreversible{''} impacts. Slow progress in emissions reduction to mitigate climate change is resulting in increased attention to what is called geoengineering, climate engineering, or climate intervention - deliberate interventions to counter climate change that seek to either modify the Earth's radiation budget or remove greenhouse gases such as CO2 from the atmosphere. When focused on CO2, the latter of these categories is called carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Future emission scenarios that stay well below 2 degrees C, and all emission scenarios that do not exceed 1.5 degrees C warming by the year 2100, require some form of CDR. At present, there is little consensus on the climate impacts and atmospheric CO2 reduction efficacy of the different types of proposed CDR. To address this need, the Carbon Dioxide Removal Model Intercomparison Project (or CDRMIP) was initiated. This project brings together models of the Earth system in a common framework to explore the potential, impacts, and challenges of CDR. Here, we describe the first set of CDRMIP experiments, which are formally part of the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). These experiments are designed to address questions concerning CDR-induced climate ``reversibility{'' the response of the Earth system to direct atmospheric CO2 removal (direct air capture and storage), and the CDR potential and impacts of afforestation and reforestation, as well as ocean alkalinization.

TI  - Assessing possible consequences of ocean liming on ocean pH, atmospheric CO2 concentration and associated costs
AB  - More than 380Pg of carbon have been released by human activities from fossil fuel combustion and cement manufacturing since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. This carbon release has caused atmospheric CO2 levels to increase by ~100ppmv compared to the highest interglacial value of the last ~800,000 years. Net uptake of carbon by the oceans has caused the surface ocean pH to drop by ~0.1 pH units. Evaluating carbon sequestration options is now timely. We use the carbon-cycle model LOSCAR to evaluate the effects of artificially enhancing ocean alkalinity from year 2020 to year 2400 on ocean pH and atmospheric pCO2. Ten different carbon emission scenarios with scaled alkalinity input are simulated. Results show that for ocean pH to be maintained above 8.0, on the order of 2-10Ã—1014moles of alkalinity/year for C emissions of 1500-5000Pg C, respectively, is required. Atmospheric pCO2 remains high (500-600ppmv) in nine of the carbon emission scenarios. Ocean alkalization, if ever implemented at such a large scale, could allow ocean pH to be stabilized but pCO2 would not return to pre-industrial levels. Cost estimates of the ocean alkalization operation, using quicklime (CaO) was estimated to range from 0.5 to 2.8$US trillion/year, depending on the target pH selected to avoid damage to marine organisms and ecosystems. For comparison, this cost is ~0.8% and ~4.6% of the 2011 global Gross Domestic Product for total anthropogenic carbon emissions of 1500 and 5000Pg C, respectively. The cost of 1ton of CO2 sequestered ranges from 103 to 144$US for total emissions of 1500-5000Pg C, respectively. Producing large amounts of quicklime (without carbon capture and storage) would cause substantial additional CO2 release. This reduces the fossil fuel emissions allowed to maintain pH above 8.0 by a factor of 1.3-2.5 (for total emissions of 1000 and 5000Pg C, respectively). Â© 2013.

TI  - Macroalgal metabolism and lateral carbon flows can create significant carbon sinks
AB  - Macroalgal beds have drawn attention as one of the vegetated coastal ecosystems that act as atmospheric CO2 sinks. Although macroalgal metabolism as well as inorganic and organic carbon flows are important pathways for CO2 uptake by macroalgal beds, the relationships between macroalgal metabolism and associated carbon flows are still poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated carbon flows, including air-water CO2 exchange and budgets of dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), in a temperate macroalgal bed during the productive months of the year. To assess the key mechanisms responsible for atmospheric CO2 uptake by the macroalgal bed, we estimated macroalgal metabolism and lateral carbon flows (i.e., carbon exchanges between the macroalgal bed and the offshore area) by using field measurements of carbon species, a field-bag method, a degradation experiment, and mass-balance modeling in a temperate Sargassum bed over a diurnal cycle. Our results showed that macroalgal metabolism and lateral carbon flows driven by water exchange affected air-water CO2 exchange in the macroalgal bed and the surrounding waters. Macroalgal metabolism caused overlying waters to contain low concentrations of CO2 and high concentrations of DOC that were efficiently exported offshore from the macroalgal bed. These results indicate that the exported water can potentially lower CO2 concentrations in the offshore surface water and enhance atmospheric CO2 uptake. Furthermore, the Sargassum bed exported 6 \%-35\% of the macroalgal net commu-nity production (NCP; 302-1378 mmolCm(-2) d(-1)) as DOC to the offshore area. The results of degradation experiments showed that 56 \%-78\% of macroalgal DOC was refractory DOC (RDOC) that persisted for 150 d; thus, the Sargassum bed exported 5 \%-20\% of the macroalgal NCP as RDOC. Our findings suggest that macroalgal beds in habitats associated with high water exchange rates can create significant CO2 sinks around them and export a substantial amount of DOC to offshore areas.

TI  - Data-driven surrogate modelling and multi-variable optimization of trickle bed and packed bubble column reactors for CO2 capture via enhanced weathering
AB  - Enhanced weathering (EW) of minerals could potentially absorb atmospheric CO2 at gigaton scale per year and store it as bicarbonate and carbonate in the ocean. However, this process must be accelerated by engineered reactors, in which optimal reaction conditions maximise the CO2 capture rate and minimise the energy and water consumption. In this work, trickle beds (TBs) and packed bubble columns (PBCs), operated with fresh water and CO2 -rich flue gas, are chosen as typical chemical reactors to perform the EW-based CO2 capture. We firstly develop experimentally validated physics-based mechanistic models then generate data to train data-driven surrogate models to achieve rapid prediction of performance and multi-variable optimization. Two surrogate models, namely, response surface methodology (RSM) and extended adaptive hybrid functions (E-AHF), are developed and compared, in which the effect of five design variables on three objective functions are investigated. Results show that the R2 for the prediction of CO2 capture rate (CR) and water consumption (WC) through RSM and E-AHF is higher than 0.84. For TB reactors, in particular, the calculated R2 is higher than 0.96. The prediction accuracy of energy consumption (EC) through the RSM approach is, however, relatively poor (R2 âˆ¼ 0.79), but is improved by using the E-AHF surrogate model, increasing to R2 âˆ¼ 0.89. The developed data-driven surrogate model can rapidly predict the performance indicators of TB and PBC reactors without solving complex mechanistic models consisting of many partial differential equations. After optimization using the surrogate models, improvements were achieved in the objectives for TB and PBC reactors as follows: CR increased by 37.8 % and 13.1 %, EC reduced by 37.4 % and 23.8 %, and WC reduced by 12.5 % and 40.7 %, respectively.

TI  - Sorption capacity of seaweed-like sodium titanate mats for Co2+removal
AB  - The development of new technologies for securing and recycling water resources are in high demand. A key focus of these technologies is the development of various ion exchangers or adsorbents that are used for the purification of aqueous solutions. Layered sodium titanate is one of the cation exchangers utilised in the removal of heavy metals and radionuclides from wastewater. To enhance the removal efficiency, the precise design of the crystal morphology, structure, and chemical composition is important. Herein, we synthesised a unique seaweed-like sodium titanate mat (SST) using a template-free alkaline hydrothermal process. The Co2+ sorption capacity of SST was investigated by batch testing with cobalt(ii) nitrate. SST, which was synthesised from titanium sulphate in a 10 M NaOH solution at 200 Â°C, had a seaweed-like structure composed of randomly distributed nanofibres of layered sodium titanate that is approximately 9 nm in diameter. The crystal shape changed from roundish crystals to fibrous crystals as the hydrothermal reaction period increased. The Co2+ sorption isotherm of SST was fitted with the Langmuir isotherm model and the maximum sorption density was 1.85 mmol g-1. The selectivity of the Co2+ sorption on SST was high in comparison to that of Ca2+ and Mg2+. Herein, the Co2+ sorption mechanisms of SST were studied in comparison with commercially available sodium titanate. Results show that controlling the crystal morphology, structure, and Na concentration of the layered titanate that can be ion-exchanged determines the cation sorption properties of sodium titanate.

TI  - Reviewing the sociotechnical dynamics of carbon removal
AB  - In recent years, carbon removal and associated net-zero energy technologies have emerged as serious options for policymakers and scientists to consider when trying to address climate change. How, where, and when to use these options effectively are, however, polemic, and research examining the social or justice dimensions of deploymentâ€”actual or prospectiveâ€”remains uncommon. This review provides an interdisciplinary and holistic perspective of the sociotechnical dynamics of carbon-removal options. It employs a sociotechnical approach that reveals the different epistemic, economic, technical, social, political, and environmental elements necessary for a net-zero energy transition. In this review, we first summarize seven broad classes of carbon removalâ€”afforestation and reforestation, soil carbon sequestration, marine biomass and blue carbon, direct air capture with carbon storage, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, enhanced weathering, and biochar. The review then explores four critical sociotechnical areas in greater depth: modeling and assessment, social acceptance, innovation and scaling, and policy and governance. We conclude with implications for policy and research. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Potential of Maritime Transport for Ocean Liming and Atmospheric CO2 Removal
AB  - Proposals to increase ocean alkalinity may make an important contribution to meeting climate change net emission targets, while also helping to ameliorate the effects of ocean acidification. However, the practical feasibility of spreading large amounts of alkaline materials in the seawater is poorly understood. In this study, the potential of discharging calcium hydroxide (slaked lime, SL) using existing maritime transport is evaluated, at the global scale and for the Mediterranean Sea. The potential discharge of SL from existing vessels depends on many factors, mainly their number and load capacity, the distance traveled along the route, the frequency of reloading, and the discharge rate. The latter may be constrained by the localized pH increase in the wake of the ship, which could be detrimental for marine ecosystems. Based on maritime traffic data from the International Maritime Organization for bulk carriers and container ships, and assuming low discharge rates and 15% of the deadweight capacity dedicated for SL transport, the maximum SL potential discharge from all active vessels worldwide is estimated to be between 1.7 and 4.0 Gt/year. For the Mediterranean Sea, based on detailed maritime traffic data, a potential discharge of about 186 Mt/year is estimated. The discharge using a fleet of 1,000 new dedicated ships has also been discussed, with a potential distribution of 1.3 Gt/year. Using average literature values of CO2 removal per unit of SL added to the sea, the global potential of CO2 removal from SL discharge by existing or new ships is estimated at several Gt/year, depending on the discharge rate. Since the potential impacts of SL discharge on the marine environment in the ships' wake limits the rate at which SL can be applied, an overview of methodologies for the assessment of SL concentration in the wake of the ships is presented. A first assessment performed with a three-dimensional non-reactive and a one-dimensional reactive fluid dynamic model simulating the shrinking of particle radii, shows that low discharge rates of a SL slurry lead to pH variations of about 1 unit for a duration of just a few minutes.

TI  - Carbon release by off-axis magmatism in a young sedimented spreading centre
AB  - Continental rifting creates narrow ocean basins, where coastal ocean upwelling results in high biological productivity and organic-rich sedimentation. In addition, topographic gradients promote silicate weathering, which consumes atmospheric CO2 (ref. 1). The carbon flux associated with these processes has led to the suggestion that rifting may cool the atmosphere, leading in some cases to glaciation2 and even a snowball Earth scenario3. Guaymas basin, within the Gulf of California, is a young spreading system where new igneous crust is formed beneath a layer of organic-rich sediment that is 1-2 kmthick. Here we present seismic data from Guaymas basin that image recent, basin-wide magmatic intrusions into sediments; sonar backscatter and seafloor photographs that indicate numerous, broadly distributed chemosynthetic seafloor biological communities, and geochemical analyses of water samples suggesting that the methane that supports these communities is derived from magma-driven thermogenic alteration of sediments. Our results suggest that active shallow magmatism releases carbon from sediments up to 50 km away from the plate boundary. This is a much larger area than the less than 5 km found at unsedimented mid-ocean ridges4, and than previously recognized. We conclude that thick sediments may promote broad magmatism, reducing the efficiency of natural carbon sequestration within young sedimented rifts. Â© 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

TI  - Geoengineering potential of artificially enhanced silicate weathering of olivine
AB  - Geoengineering is a proposed action to manipulate Earth's climate in order to counteract global warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. We investigate the potential of a specific geoengineering technique, carbon sequestration by artificially enhanced silicate weathering via the dissolution of olivine. This approach would not only operate against rising temperatures but would also oppose ocean acidification, because it influences the global climate via the carbon cycle. If important details of the marine chemistry are taken into consideration, a new mass ratio of CO2 sequestration per olivine dissolution of about 1 is achieved, 20\% smaller than previously assumed. We calculate that this approach has the potential to sequestrate up to 1 Pg of C per year directly, if olivine is distributed as fine powder over land areas of the humid tropics, but this rate is limited by the saturation concentration of silicic acid. In our calculations for the Amazon and Congo river catchments, a maximum annual dissolution of 1.8 and 0.4 Pg of olivine seems possible, corresponding to the sequestration of 0.5 and 0.1 Pg of C per year, but these upper limit sequestration rates come at the environmental cost of pH values in the rivers rising to 8.2. Open water dissolution of fine-grained olivine and an enhancement of the biological pump by the rising riverine input of silicic acid might increase our estimate of the carbon sequestration, but additional research is needed here. We finally calculate with a carbon cycle model the consequences of sequestration rates of 1-5 Pg of C per year for the 21st century by this technique.

TI  - Role of abiotic factors in enhancing the capacity of mangroves in reducing ocean acidification
AB  - The present study investigated the effects of rising carbon dioxide levels in nature and the carbon sequestration potential of dominant mangrove species for reducing the toxic effects of ocean acidification. The study was conducted on the east coast of Odisha, in the western Bay of Bengal. To determine the effect of these ambient parameters on the absorption of carbon dioxide by the mangroves, water temperature, salinity, pH levels of seawater along with soil texture and pH, salinity expressed in electrical conductivity, compactness expressed in bulk density, and soil organic carbon were simultaneously monitored. The aboveground biomass and carbon of the selected species were studied for 2 consecutive years at 10 designated stations. The total carbon calculated for the study area varied from 242.50 Â± 49.00 to 1321.29 Â± 445.52 tons with a mean of 626.68 Â± 174.81 tons for Bhitarkanika and Mahanadi mangrove chunks. This is equivalent to 2299.92 Â± 641.55 tons of CO2 absorbed from the atmosphere. A total of 27 equations were selected as the best fit models for the study area. The equations between mangrove biomass and carbon along with aquatic and edaphic factors governing the pH of water and soil strongly support the positive influence of mangrove photosynthetic activity in shifting the equilibrium toward alkalinity. This calls for conservation of mangrove ecosystem to minimize the pace of acidification of estuarine water. The results indicate that Excoecariaagallocha and Avicennia marina as are the most capable species for combatting maximum carbon dioxide toxicity from the atmosphere; which will be helpful in REDD + programs and carbon-based payments for ecosystem services (PES).

TI  - Identifying Appropriate Locations for the Accelerated Weathering of Limestone to Reduce CO2 Emissions
AB  - The reduction in CO2 emissions is a major task for the coming decades. Accelerated weathering of limestone (AWL) can be used to capture CO2 from effluent gas streams and store it as bicarbonate in marine environments. We give an overview of the fundamental aspects of AWL, including associated CO2 emissions during the operation of AWL, characteristics of the accumulating bicarbonate-rich product water, and factors influencing the outgassing of CO2 from the ocean back into the atmosphere. Based on these aspects, we identify locations where AWL could be carried out favorably. The energy demand for AWL reduces the theoretical CO2 sequestration potential, for example, by only 5\% in the case of a 100 km transport of limestone on roads. AWL-derived product water is characterized by high alkalinity but low pH values and, once in contact with the atmosphere, passive outgassing of CO2 from AWL-derived water occurs. This process is mainly driven by the difference between the fCO(2) in the atmosphere and the oceanic surface layer, as well as the sea surface temperature at the discharge site. Promising sites for AWL may be in Florida or around the Mediterranean Sea, where outgassing could be prevented by injections into deep water layers.

TI  - Anthropogenic CO2 of High Emission Scenario Compensated After 3500 Years of Ocean Alkalinization With an Annually Constant Dissolution of 5 Pg of Olivine
AB  - The CO2 removal model inter-comparison (CDRMIP) has been established to approximate the usefulness of climate mitigation by some well-defined negative emission technologies. I here analyze ocean alkalinization in a high CO2 world (emission scenario SSP5-85-EXT++ and CDR-ocean-alk within CDRMIP) for the next millennia using a revised version of the carbon cycle model BICYCLE, whose long-term feedbacks are calculated for the next 1 million years. The applied model version not only captures atmosphere, ocean, and a constant marine and terrestrial biosphere, but also represents solid Earth processes, such as deep ocean CaCO3 accumulation and dissolution, volcanic CO2 outgassing, and continental weathering. In the applied negative emission experiment, 0.14 Pmol/yr of alkalinityâ€”comparable to the dissolution of 5 Pg of olivine per yearâ€”is entering the surface ocean starting in year 2020 for either 50 or 5000 years. I find that the cumulative emissions of 6,740 PgC emitted until year 2350 lead to a peak atmospheric CO2 concentration of nearly 2,400 ppm in year 2326, which is reduced by only 200 ppm by the alkalinization experiment. Atmospheric CO2 is brought down to 400 or 300 ppm after 2730 or 3480 years of alkalinization, respectively. Such low CO2 concentrations are reached without ocean alkalinization only after several hundreds of thousands of years, when the feedbacks from weathering and sediments bring the part of the anthropogenic emissions that stays in the atmosphere (the so-called airborne fraction) below 4%. The efficiency of carbon sequestration by this alkalinization approach peaks at 9.7 PgC per Pmol of alkalinity added during times of maximum anthropogenic CO2 emissions and slowly declines to half this value 2000 years later due to the non-linear marine chemistry response and ocean-sediment processes. In other words, ocean alkalinization sequesters carbon only as long as the added alkalinity stays in the ocean. To understand the basic model behavior, I analytically explain why in the simulation results a linear relationship in the transient climate response (TCR) to cumulative emissions is found for low emissions (similarly as for more complex climate models), which evolves for high emissions to a non-linear relation.

TI  - The role of enhanced rock weathering deployment with agriculture in limiting future warming and protecting coral reefs
AB  - Meeting the net-zero carbon emissions commitments of major economies by mid-century requires large-scale deployment of negative emission technologies (NETs). Terrestrial enhanced rock weathering on croplands (ERW) is a NET with co-benefits for agriculture, soils and ocean acidification that creates opportunities for generating income unaffected by diminishing carbon taxes as emissions approach net-zero. Here we show that ERW deployment with croplands to deliver net 2 Gt CO2 yr-1 removal approximately doubles the probability of meeting the Paris 1.5 Â°C target at 2100 from 23% to 42% in a high mitigation Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6 baseline climate. Carbon removal via carbon capture and storage (CCS) at the same rate had an equivalent effect. Co-deployment of ERW and CCS tripled the chances of meeting a 1.5 Â°C target (from 23% to 67%), and may be sufficient to reverse about one third of the surface ocean acidification effect caused by increases in atmospheric CO2 over the past 200 years. ERW increased the percentage of coral reefs above an aragonite saturation threshold of 3.5 from 16% to 39% at 2100, higher than CCS, highlighting a co-benefit for marine calcifying ecosystems. However, the degree of ocean state recovery in our simulations is highly uncertain and ERW deployment cannot substitute for near-term rapid CO2 emissions reductions. Â© 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Carbon sequestration via enhanced weathering of peridotites and basalts in seawater
AB  - Enhanced weathering of mafic and ultramafic rocks has been suggested as a carbon sequestration strategy for the mitigation of climate change. This study was designed to assess the potential drawdown of CO2 directly from the atmosphere by the enhanced weathering of peridotites and basalts in seawater. Pulverized, and ball milled dunite, harzburgite and olivine basalt were reacted in artificial seawater in batch reactor systems open to the atmosphere for two months. The results demonstrate that the ball-milled dunite and harzburgite changed dramatically the chemical composition of the seawater within a few hours, inducing CO2 drawdown directly from the atmosphere and ultimately the precipitation of aragonite. In contrast, pulverized but unmilled rocks, and the ball-milled basalt, did not yield any significant changes in seawater composition during the two-month experiments. As much as 10 wt percent aragonite was precipitated during the experiment containing the finest-grained dunite. These results demonstrate that ball milling can substantially enhance the weathering rate of peridotites in marine environments, promoting the permanent storage of CO2 as environmentally benign carbonate minerals through enhanced weathering. The precipitation of Mg-silicate clay minerals, however, could reduce the efficiency of this carbon sequestration approach over longer timescales. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Electrochemical acceleration of chemical weathering for carbon capture and sequestration
AB  - We describe an approach to CO2 capture and storage from the atmosphere that involves enhancing the solubility of CO2 in the ocean by an engineered process equivalent to the natural silicate weathering process. HCl is electrochemically removed from the ocean and neutralized through reaction with silicate rocks. The alkaline solution resulting from the removal of HCl is neutralized by capturing atmospheric CO2 and is dissolved into the ocean where the carbon will be stored primarily as HCO3- without further acidifying the ocean. On time scales of hundreds of years or longer, some of the additional alkalinity is expected to lead to precipitation or enhanced preservation of CaCO3, resulting in the permanent storage of the associated carbon, and the return of an equal amount of carbon to the atmosphere. The overall process is equivalent to the earth's natural chemical weathering process of silicate rocks. Whereas the natural silicate weathering process is effected primarily by carbonic acid, the engineered process accelerates the weathering kinetics to industrial rates by replacing this weak acid with HCl. In the thermodynamic limit-and with the appropriate silicate rocks-the overall reaction is spontaneous. A range of efficiency scenarios indicates that the process should require 100-400Â kJ of work per mol of CO2 captured and stored for relevant timescales. The process can be powered from stranded energy sources too remote to be useful for the direct needs of populations. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide by increasing ocean alkalinity
AB  - We present a preliminary analysis of a geoengineering option based on the intentional increase of ocean alkalinity to enhance marine storage of atmospheric CO2. Like all geoengineering techniques to limit climate change, with today's limited understandig of the climate system, this approach must be regarded as a potential strategic option that requires ongoing assessment to establish its potential benefits and side effecs. CO2 would be absorbed from the atmosphere by the oceans at an increased rate if ocean alkalinity were raised. Ocean alkalinity might be raised by introducing the dissolution products of alkaline minerals into the oceans. The limited deposits of naturally occurring soda ash (Na2CO3) are readily soluble and easily mined. Limestone (CaCO3) is abundant in the Earth's crust but is not readily soluble. This analysis explores the potential feasibility and limits of such approaches. Â© 1995.

TI  - Biological impacts of enhanced alkalinity in Carcinus maenas
AB  - Further steps are needed to establish feasible alleviation strategies that are able to reduce the impacts of ocean acidification, whilst ensuring minimal biological side-effects in the process. Whilst there is a growing body of literature on the biological impacts of many other carbon dioxide reduction techniques, seemingly little is known about enhanced alkalinity. For this reason, we investigated the potential physiological impacts of using chemical sequestration as an alleviation strategy. In a controlled experiment, Carcinus maenas were acutely exposed to concentrations of Ca(OH)2 that would be required to reverse the decline in ocean surface pH and return it to pre-industrial levels. Acute exposure significantly affected all individuals' acid-base balance resulting in slight respiratory alkalosis and hyperkalemia, which was strongest in mature females. Although the trigger for both of these responses is currently unclear, this study has shown that alkalinity addition does alter acid-base balance in this comparatively robust crustacean species.

TI  - Reservoir stratigraphic heterogeneity within the Lower Cretaceous Muddy Sandstone in the Powder River Basin, northeast Wyoming, U.S.A.: Implications for carbon dioxide sequestration
AB  - The Muddy Sandstone in the Powder River Basin (PRB), northeast Wyoming, is a promising reservoir for CO2 sequestration because: (1) existing wells for hydrocarbon production can be used for CO2 injection when a field is depleted; and (2) data are available to assess the ability and capacity to trap CO2. Here, I provide new data and compile published results to: (1) characterize four oil and gas fields (the Amos Draw, Kitty, Hilight, and Sand Dunes fields) in the PRB with respect to lithofacies, sedimentary environment, sandstone composition, sand-body geometry, and porosity and permeability; and (2) assess the controls on reservoir heterogeneity and the CO2 sequestration potential. Five lithofacies are recognized based on core description and log responses. They are interpreted as offshore, lower-middle wave-dominated shoreface, weathering zone, fluvial incised-valley, and tideinfluenced estuarine depositional environments. The Muddy Sandstone contains predominantly quartz, with total quartz higher than 70 percent of the total framework grains. The percentage of feldspar is generally less than 5 percent, except for the Rozet Member in the Amos Draw Field, which is up to 22 percent. Sandstone petrographic examination also shows that the Muddy Sandstone can be divided into four groups based on the relative abundance of pore space, carbonate cement, and matrix. Sandstone with high porosity up to 23 percent is found in the shoreface lithofacies in the Amos Draw and Hilight fields and is also found in the estuarine lithofacies in the Kitty Field. The incised-valley lithofacies is of particularly low porosity due to high matrix content and carbonate cementation. The measured porosity in the sandstone varies between 1 percent and 23 percent, and the permeability is generally less than 10 millidarcys (mD). The variation of porosity is consistent with the observation in thin sections. XRD results show that the pore-filling clay minerals include kaolinite, chlorite, illite, and smectite. Core and well log correlation show that sandstone formed in lower-middle shoreface environments is laterally extensive and of uniform thickness, whereas sandstone of fluvial and estuarine origins is more variable in lateral extent and thickness. Based on examination of lithofacies, sandstone geometry, and thin section petrography, I suggest that the best reservoir interval for CO2 sequestration in the Amos Draw Field is the lower Rozet Member, in the Sand Dunes and Hilight fields is the Springen Ranch Member, and in the Kitty Field is the Ute Member. Variables examined in this study provide important inputs for calculating CO2 capacity potential and predicting chemical reactivity after CO2 injection. Reservoir quality of the Muddy Sandstone is highly heterogeneous, and the complexity may be attributed to a combination of depositional environment, history of relative sea-level change during deposition, and type and extent of diagenetic alteration. The Muddy Sandstone, along with the overlying Mowry Shale, represents one third-order depositional sequence. Diagenetic processes include feldspar and lithic dissolution, secondary clay formation, quartz overgrowth, and four stages of carbonate cementation, which are early dolomite overgrowth, secondary calcite filling, dolomite replacement, and spotty siderite cementation. Carbonate cementation is interpreted as early diagenetic products formed during marine transgressions.

AB  - We describe an approach to CO2 capture and storage from the atmosphere that involves enhancing the solubility of CO2 in the ocean by a process equivalent to the natural silicate weathering reaction. HCl is electrochemically removed from the ocean and neutralized through reaction with silicate rocks. The increase in ocean alkalinity resulting from the removal of HCl causes atmospheric CO2 to dissolve into the ocean where it will be stored primarily as HCO3- without further acidifying the ocean. On timescales of hundreds of years or longer, some of the additional alkalinity will likely lead to precipitation or enhanced preservation of CaCO3, resulting in the permanent storage of the associated carbon, and the return of an equal amount of carbon to the atmosphere. Whereas the natural silicate weathering process is effected primarily by carbonic acid, the engineered process accelerates the weathering kinetics to industrial rates by replacing this weak acid with HCl. In the thermodynamic limit - and with the appropriate silicate rocks-the overall reaction is spontaneous. A range of efficiency scenarios indicates that the process should require 100-400 kJ of work per mol of CO2 captured and stored for relevant timescales. The process can be powered from stranded energy sources too remote to be useful for the direct needs of population centers. It may also be useful on a regional scale for protection of coral reefs from further ocean acidification. Application of this technology may involve neutralizing the alkaline solution that is coproduced with HCl with CO2 from a point source or from the atmosphere prior to being returned to the ocean.

TI  - The global potential for converting renewable electricity to negative-CO2-emissions hydrogen
AB  - The IPCC has assigned a critical role to negative-CO2-emissions energy in meeting energy and climate goals by the end of the century, with biomass energy plus carbon capture and storage (BECCS) prominently featured. We estimate that methods of combining saline water electrolysis with mineral weathering powered by any source of non-fossil fuel-derived electricity could, on average, increase energy generation and CO2 removal by >50 times relative to BECCS, at equivalent or lower cost. This electrogeochemistry avoids the need to produce and store concentrated CO2, instead converting and sequestering CO2 as already abundant, long-lived forms of ocean alkalinity. Such energy systems could also greatly reduce land and freshwater impacts relative to BECCS, and could also be integrated into conventional energy production to reduce its carbon footprint. Further research is needed to better understand the full range and capacity of the world's negative-emissions options.

TI  - A comparative global assessment of potential negative emissions technologies
AB  - The paper summarises a global assessment of around 30 prospective negative emissions techniques (NETs) found in the literature. Fourteen techniques including direct air capture, BECCS, biochar, and ocean alkalinity enhancement are considered in more detail. The novel functional categorisation of NETs developed in the course of the assessment is set out and a comparative quantitative summary of the results is presented, focusing on the relative readiness, global capacity, costs and side-effects of the prospective NETs. Both technology specific and more generic potential limitations are discussed, notably those arising from energy requirements, from availability of geological storage capacity and from sustainable supply of biomass. Conclusions are drawn regarding the overall scope of NETs to contribute to safe carbon budgets, and challenges arising in the future governance of NETs, with particular reference to the potential role of carbon markets.

TI  - Current Status and Potential Assessment of China?s Ocean Carbon Sinks
AB  - The role of ocean carbon sinks in global climate changemitigation and carbon neutrality is still affected by lack of research.Aiming at overcoming the present limitations, a comprehensive andholistic framework and accounting method of ocean carbon sinkevaluation are proposed in this study, which consider both carbon sinktypes and their characteristic carbon storage cycle timescales. Theresults show that (1) China's total ocean carbon sink is 69.83-106.46Tg C/year, among which the mariculture, coastal wetlands, andoffshore carbon sinks are 2.27-4.06, 2.86-5.85, and 64.70-96.55 TgC/year, respectively; (2) ocean-based solutions such as coastalprotection and restoration, mariculture development, ocean alkaliza-tion, ocean fertilization, and marine bioenergy with carbon capture andstorage have substantial mitigation potential, but further investigation is required before large-scale deployment; (3) althoughChina's ocean carbon sinks only counterbalanced 3.27-4.99\% of its fossil fuel emissions, their tremendous enhancing potential andspecific advantages cannot be ignored, and enhancing measures must be taken according to regional characteristics; (4) someuncertainties and limitations still exist, and problems such as double counting, carbon sink offset, and so forth need to be furtherconsidered. In a word, this study provides a basis for the development of ocean-based solutions on closing climate mitigation gaps.

TI  - Accelerated weathering of limestone for CO2 mitigation opportunities for the stone and cement industries
AB  - Large amounts of limestone fines coproduced during the processing of crushed limestone may be useful in the sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO 2). Accelerated weathering of limestone (AWL) is proposed as a low-tech method to capture and sequester CO2 from fossil fuel-fired power plants and other point-sources such as cement manufacturing. AWL reactants are readily available, inexpensive, and environmentally benign. Waste CO 2 is hydrated with water to produce carbonic acid, which then reacts with and is neutralized by limestone fines, thus converting CO2 gas to dissolved calcium bicarbonate. AWL waste products can be disposed of in the ocean. Feasibility requires access to an inexpensive source of limestone and to seawater, thus limiting AWL facilities within about 10 km of the coastline. The majority of U.S. coastal power generating facilities are within economical transport distance of limestone resources. AWL presents opportunities for collaborative efforts among the crushed stone industry, electrical utilities, cement manufactures, and research scientists.

TI  - CO2 mitigation via capture and chemical conversion in seawater
AB  - A lab-scale seawater/mineral carbonate gas scrubber was found to remove up to 97% of CO2 in a simulated flue gas stream at ambient temperature and pressure, with a large fraction of this carbon ultimately converted to dissolved calcium bicarbonate. After full equilibration with air, up to 85% of the captured carbon was retained in solution, that is, it did not degas or precipitate. Thus, above-ground CO2 hydration and mineral carbonate scrubbing may provide a relatively simple point-source CO2 capture and storage scheme at coastal locations. Such low- tech CO2 mitigation could be especially relevant for retrofitting to existing power plants and for deployment in the developing world, the primary source of future CO2 emissions. Addition of the resulting alkaline solution to the ocean may benefit marine ecosystems that are currently threatened by acidification, while also allowing the utilization of the vast potential of the sea to safely sequester anthropogenic carbon. This approach in essence hastens Nature's own very effective but slow CO2 mitigation process; carbonate mineral weathering is a major consumer of excess atmospheric CO 2 and ocean acidity on geologic times scales.

TI  - Seaweed-based fertilizing products
AB  - The current cultivation practices mainly use fertilizing products in order to increase crop yield and to improve soil structure and quality. However, short- and long-term negative impacts on the environment of some fertilizing products of mineral origin have already been described. Thus, the challenge is to search for a new generation of sustainable agro-products to address the feeding of the global population, the environment protection, and the climate change. Among the marine flora, seaweeds due to their unique composition can be used to manufacture agricultural products. Seaweeds can be applied as fertilizing products in different forms, such as biofertilizers, liming materials, soil improvers, plant biostimulants, and fertilizing product blends. One of the most frequently used seaweed-based fertilizing products (SFPs) is plant growth biostimulants applied in the form of extracts. This chapter presents examples of seaweed-based fertilizing products, methods of their production, as well as their effect on plant growth. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Alkaline thermal treatment of seaweed for high-purity hydrogen production with carbon capture and storage potential
AB  - Current thermochemical methods to generate H2 include gasification and steam reforming of coal and natural gas, in which anthropogenic CO2 emission is inevitable. If biomass is used as a source of H2, the process can be considered carbon-neutral. Seaweeds are among the less studied types of biomass with great potential because they do not require freshwater. Unfortunately, reaction pathways to thermochemically convert salty and wet biomass into H2 are limited. In this study, a catalytic alkaline thermal treatment of brown seaweed is investigated to produce high purity H2 with substantially suppressed CO2 formation making the overall biomass conversion not only carbon-neutral but also potentially carbon-negative. High-purity 69.69 mmol-H2/(dry-ash-free)g-brown seaweed is produced with a conversion as high as 71%. The hydroxide is involved in both H2 production and in situ CO2 capture, while the Ni/ZrO2 catalyst enhanced the secondary H2 formation via steam methane reforming and water-gas shift reactions.

TI  - Coupling Mineral Carbonation and Ocean Liming
AB  - The process by which basic/ultrabasic silicate minerals (e.g., olivine) are reacted with CO2 to produce solid carbonate minerals ({''}mineral carbonation{''}) has been suggested as a method to sequester carbon dioxide from point sources into stable carbonate minerals. Alternatively, the addition of lime (produced from calcining carbonate minerals) to the surface ocean ({''}ocean liming{''}), which results in an increase in ocean pH and a draw-down of atmospheric CO2 has been proposed as a ``geoengineering{''} technology, which stores carbon as dissolved alkalinity in the surface ocean. Combining these approaches, in which the magnesium carbonate minerals produced from mineral carbonation are used as a feedstock for ocean liming (mineral carbonation-ocean liming; MC-OL); may reduce the limitations of individual technologies while maximizing the benefits. Approximately 1.9 metric tons of magnesium silicate (producing 0.7 ton of magnesium oxide) are required for every net ton of CO2 sequestered. A total of 0.7 ton of CO2 is produced from this activity, 70\% of which is high-purity (>98\%) from calcining and potentially amenable for geological storage. The technology can be conceptually viewed as an alternative to direct air capture and swaps ambient CO2 for high-purity point source CO2. MC-OL requires approximately 4.9 and 2.2 GJ of thermal and electrical energy ton(-1) of CO2 sequestered. MC-OL has less demand for geological storage; only 0.5 ton of CO2 needs to be injected for every ton of CO2 removed from the atmosphere. However, manipulation of ocean chemistry in this way potentially creates an additional environmental impact (localized elevated pH or co-dissolution of trace metals) and requires attention.

TI  - A novel technology of carbon dioxide adsorption and mineralization via seawater decalcification by bipolar membrane electrodialysis system with a crystallizer
AB  - Seawater carbon sequestration can not only reduce the greenhouse effect by carbon dioxide mineralization but also achieve seawater calcium removal. Generally, this process requires the addition alkaline reagents to make a high pH environment. This study developed a novel seawater carbon sequestration technology using a bipolar membrane electrodialysis system with a crystallizer. The results showed the new system had excellent synergistic effects. Water dissociation, CO2 adsorption and precipitation reactions between CO32- and seawater could be carried out in the system without the membrane contamination. With the electric-field, water dissociation occurred on the bipolar membrane and the alkalinity was used to enhance the absorption and ionization of CO2 in the chamber. Based on the ions selective mobility through the anionic membrane, weak base ions combined with seawater in the salt chamber. However, the cations in seawater, calcium and magnesium ions, could not pass through the anionic membrane, which prevented the pollution of the bipolar membrane. Meanwhile, the ion concentrations of CO32- was controlled and primary nucleation of CaCO3 could not occur in the salt chamber. The seeded crystallization in the crystallizer increased the reaction area and consumed the supersaturation degree of CaCO3. This study examined the effects of CO2 access mode of the membrane stack and the induced crystal seeds in the crystallizer on membrane fouling, seawater decalcification, carbon sequestration and energy consumption. This new system indicated the direction of bipolar membrane application in the adsorption and reactive crystallization of acid gas.

TI  - Lithium-isotope evidence for enhanced silicate weathering during OAE 1a (Early Aptian Selli event)
AB  - An abrupt rise in temperature, forced by a massive input of CO2 into the atmosphere, is commonly invoked as the main trigger for Oceanic Anoxic Events (OAEs). Global warming initiated a cascade of palaeoenvironmental perturbations starting with increased continental weathering and an accelerated hydrological cycle that delivered higher loads of nutrients to coastal areas, stimulating biological productivity. The end-result was widespread anoxia and deposition of black shales: the hallmarks of OAEs. In order to assess the role of weathering as both an OAE initiator and terminator (via CO2 sequestration) during the Early Aptian OAE 1a (Selli Event, similar to 120 Ma) the isotopic ratio of lithium isotopes was analysed in three sections of shallow-marine carbonates from the Pacific and Tethyan realms and one basinal pelagic section from the Tethyan domain. Because the isotopic composition of lithium in seawater is largely controlled by continental silicate weathering and high- and low-temperature alteration of basaltic material, a shift to lighter delta Li-7 values is expected to characterize OAEs. The studied sections illustrate this phenomenon: delta Li-7 values decrease to a minimum coincident with the negative carbon-isotope excursion that effectively records the onset of OAE 1a. A second negative delta Li-7 excursion occurs coeval with the minimum in strontium isotopes after the event. The striking similarity to the strontium-isotope record argues for a common driver. The formation and destruction (weathering) of an oceanic LIP could account for the parallel trend in both isotope systems. The double-spike in lithium isotopes is probably related to a change in weathering congruencies. Such a chemostratigraphy is consistent with the hypothesis that an increase in silicate weathering, in conjunction with organic-carbon burial, led to drawdown of atmospheric CO2 during the early Aptian OAE 1 a.

TI  - Oceanic carbon capture through electrochemically induced in situ carbonate mineralization using bipolar membrane
AB  - Bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BPMED) can provide a sustainable route to capture the oceanic-dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) using an electrochemical pH swing concept. Previous works demonstrated how gaseous CO2 (through acidification) can be obtained from ocean water, and how carbonate minerals can be provided via ex situ alkalinization. In this work, we present, for the first time, the in situ mineralization via the alkalinization route using both real and synthetic seawater. An in situ pH-swing, inside of the BPMED cell, allows reducing the energy consumption of the oceanic-DIC capture. We demonstrate that, by accurately controlling the applied current density and cell residence time, the energy required for the process can be indeed lowered through facilitating an optimized pH in the cell (i.e., base-pH 9.6-10). Within this alkaline pH-window, we capture between 60\% (for real seawater) up to 85\% (for synthetic seawater) of the DIC from the feed, together with minor Mg(OH)(2) precipitates. The CaCO3(s) production increases linearly with the applied current density, with a theoretical maximum extraction of 97 \%. The energy consumption is dominated by the ohmic losses and BPM-overpotential. Through tuning the current density and flow rate, we optimised the energy consumption by applying a mild in situ pH-swing of ca. pH 3.2 - 9.75 (for real seawater). As a result, aragonite was extracted by using of 318 +/- 29 kJ mol(-1) CaCO3(s) (i.e., ca. 0.88 kWh kg(-1) CaCO3(s)) from real seawater in a cell containing ten bipolar - cation exchange membrane cell pairs, which is less than half of the previously lowest energy consumption for carbonate mineralization from (synthetic) seawater.

TI  - Dissolved and particulate carbon export from a tropical mangrove-dominated riverine system
AB  - Despite being a major component in the mangrove carbon (blue carbon) budget, ``outwelling{''} flux (or export to the sea) has gained little attention relative to other biogeochemical fluxes and reservoir carbon stock estimations. This study aims to estimate lateral exchange fluxes of dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC, POC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from the watershed through a microtidal mangrove-dominated estuary to the coastal sea in Panay Island, Philippines. Along the estuarine transect, consistent addition of DOC, DIC, and POC at higher salinities were attributed to mangrove organic matter input. Upstream groundwater input (carbonate weathering) and downstream mangrove organic matter decomposition (possibly sulfate reduction) were the main controls on DIC. DOC corresponded to relatively pure mangrove sources in creek water, while POC was a mixture of detrital and algal organic matter. The mangrove system acted as net exporter of carbon to the sea in both dry and wet seasons. From short-term observations, outwelling fluxes of mangrove-derived DOC, DIC, and POC contributed 27-53\%, 8-31\%, and 42\%, respectively, to their estuarine outflow. Unlike other studies, such low percentage for DIC might result from other external nonmangrove input (e.g., watershed carbonate weathering). Overall estuarine carbon flux was dominated by DIC (90-95\%) with only minor contribution from DOC. The approach utilized in this study to estimate lateral carbon flux specific to a small mangrove setting can be useful in delineating blue carbon budgets that avoid geographical and methodological biases.

TI  - Enhanced silicate weathering of tropical shelf sediments exposed during glacial lowstands: A sink for atmospheric CO2
AB  - Atmospheric CO2 and global climate are closely coupled. Since 800 ka CO2 concentrations have been up to 50\% higher during interglacial compared to glacial periods. Because of its dependence on temperature, humidity, and erosion rates, chemical weathering of exposed silicate minerals was suggested to have dampened these cyclic variations of atmospheric composition. Cooler and drier conditions and lower non-glacial erosion rates suppressed in situ chemical weathering rates during glacial periods. However, using systematic variations in major element geochemistry, Sr-Nd isotopes and clay mineral records from Ocean Drilling Program Sites 1143 and 1144 in the South China Sea spanning the last 1.1 Ma, we show that sediment deposited during glacial periods was more weathered than sediment delivered during interglacials. We attribute this to sub-aerial exposure and weathering of unconsolidated shelf sediments during glacial sealevel lowstands. Our estimates suggest that enhanced silicate weathering of tropical shelf sediments exposed during glacial lowstands can account for similar to 9\% of the carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere during the glacial and thus represent a significant part of the observed glacial-interglacial variation of similar to 80 ppmv. As a result, if similar magnitudes can be identified in other tropical shelf-slope systems, the effects of increased sediment exposure and subsequent silicate weathering during lowstands could have potentially enhanced the drawdown of atmospheric CO2 during cold stages of the Quaternary. This in turn would have caused an intensification of glacial cycles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Possibility for CO2 Sequestration Using Sea Water
AB  - In view of the abundant calcium and magnesium ions in sea water, an approach to CO2 capture and sequestration is put forward through enhancing the alkalinity of sea water and increasing the partial pressure of CO2. The purpose of these measures is to increase the concentration of carbonate ion and then accelerate the formation of carbonate precipitation, such as CaCO3 and MgCO3. With the increase of pH, some non-target product, e. g. Mg(OH)(2), may emerge and precipitate from sea water system, so there is a top limit which is found to be pH=9.25 in order to avoid this problem. Considering that it takes a long time for surface ocean water to absorb atmospheric CO2, the engineered process may accelerate the natural kinetics to industrial rates if sea water is applied to scrub flue gas. Through calculation, it is found that applying alkalinity-enhanced sea water to accelerate the formation of carbonate precipitation is a potential and promising method to capture and sequester CO2. In actual application, condensed sea water from desalination plant or high concentration brine can be introduced to react with waste CO2. Additionally, if these carbonate precipitation could be separated, the natural carbonate resources, such as limestone, would be saved to some degree.

TI  - The continental shelf carbon pump in the northern Adriatic Sea (Mediterranean Sea): Influence of wintertime variability
AB  - The northern Adriatic Sea, a marginal sea of the Mediterranean, is both a highly productive shelf area and a dense water formation site. The combination of productivity and dense water formation on the shelf (i.e., the continental shelf carbon pump process) enhances the vertical transport of carbon into the interior of the Mediterranean Sea contributing to the atmospheric CO2 sequestration. In this study, the carbon air-sea exchange and the continental shelf pump process are investigated by coupling the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) with a biogeochemical model (AdriBio) that includes a carbonate dynamics module. The results of the numerical simulations show that the northern Adriatic Sea is currently a CO2 sink, with an annual flux of approximately 2.9mmol/m2/d. The carbon cycle on the continental shelf is the result of a complex interaction of several processes that induce significant temporal and spatial variability in CO2 fluxes and transport. Simulation results show that winter cooling affects the solubility of CO2 on a basin-wide scale and governs the intensity of the vertical transport of carbon out of the shelf by modulating both the properties and the volume of the newly formed dense water masses. In warm winter conditions, the mitigation of the solubility pump process and the reduced dense water formation result in a significant decrease in atmospheric CO2 sequestration and deep-carbon transport with respect to the reference condition. Biological processes (i.e., net primary production and sink of particulate matter) contribute up to more than half of the CO2 air-sea flux, but they must be spatially synchronized with the dense water formation to maximize the efficiency of the carbon transport into the deepest layers of the Adriatic Sea. Finally, the terrestrial input of dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity and the exchanges across the Otranto Strait can affect the carbonate system equilibrium in the area - hence the magnitude of the air-sea CO2 exchange - but have little impact on the deep-carbon transport.

TI  - Buffered versus non-buffered ocean carbon reservoir variations: Application to the sensitivity of atmospheric pCO2 to ocean circulation changes
AB  - Changes in the ocean circulation on millenial timescales can impact the atmospheric CO2 concentration by two distinct mechanisms: either by modifying the non-buffered ocean carbon storage (through changes in the physical and biological oceanic pumps) or by directly varying the surface mean oceanic partial pressure of pCO2 (through changes in mean surface alkalinity, temperature or salinity). The equal importance of the two mechanisms is illustrated here by introducing a diagnostic buffered carbon budget on the results of simulations performed with an Earth System Climate Model. For all the circulation changes considered in this study (due to a freshening of the North Atlantic, or a change in the Southern Hemisphere Westerly winds), the sign of the atmospheric CO2 response is opposite to the sign of the non-buffered ocean carbon storage change, indicating a transfer of carbon between ocean and atmosphere reservoirs. However the concomitant changes in the buffered ocean carbon reservoir can either greatly enhance or almost inhibit the atmospheric response depending on its sign. This study also demonstrates the utility of the buffered carbon budget approach in diagnosing the transient response of the global carbon cycle to climatic variations.

TI  - Taking it outside: Exploring social opposition to 21 early-stage experiments in radical climate interventions
AB  - Large-scale and highly experimental interventions are being considered as strategies to address climate change. These include carbon dioxide removal approaches that are becoming a key pillar of post-Paris assessment and governance, as well as the more controversial suite of solar geoengineering methods. In this paper, we ask: Who defends and opposes these experiments, and why? After screening 44 early-stage experiments, we conduct a qualitative comparative analysis of 21 of them in five areas: ocean fertilization, marine cloud brightening, stratospheric aerosol injection, ice protection, and enhanced weathering. We develop a common framework of analysis, treating experiments as sites in which the risks and appropriate governance of early-stage science and technology are envisioned and disputed among scientists and other social groups. Our contribution is to map and explain the key issues of contention (why), actors (who), and tactics (how) that have shaped opposition across these linked fields of experimentation and technological development, from the 1990s till today. In doing so, we build upon and connect past studies on particular climate experiments and develop insights relevant to governance outlooks perceptions, discourses, and intents surrounding immature but potentially crucial climate technologies.

TI  - CO2 sequestration and extreme Mg depletion in serpentinized peridotite clasts from the Devonian Solund basin, SW-Norway
AB  - The conglomerates of the Solund Devonian basin of SW-Norway contain numerous (locally up to 20vol.%) peridotitic clasts with concentric mm- to 10-cm thick zones of varying red to black color. The peridotite clasts show a clear, alteration-related textural evolution. The least-altered rocks are partly serpentinized peridotites, showing a typical mesh texture with veins of serpentine, magnesite and Ni-rich magnetite surrounding olivine (Fo91) relicts and its Mg-depleted, clay-like alteration product (deweylite assemblage). In the more advanced ophicarbonate stage, the mesh cells contain calcite, silica and are surrounded by talc. In the final stage, quartz, calcite, and hematite dominate the mineralogy and occur together with minor amounts of chromite, talc, Cr-chlorite, and Cr-hydroandradite. In tandem with this textural evolution is a decrease in MgO from 40 to 2.5wt% and a CaO increase from 1 to 35wt%. All peridotite clasts are characterized by high Cr and Ni concentrations. The chemistry and the textural evolution show that the clasts formed by an extreme Mg-mobilization from the peridotite, with development of secondary porosity and subsequent precipitation of calcite. MgO removed from the clasts after burial is in part consumed by replacement reactions in the sediment matrix around the clasts where Mg-free minerals (e.g., almandine) are replaced by Mg-bearing minerals (e.g., talc). Calculated apparent 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the clasts at 385Ma (0.7124-0.7139), corresponding to the inferred age of sediment deposition and incipient clast alteration, indicate interaction with diagenetic basinal fluids. We explain the reaction history as a three stage process involving (a) partial serpentinization of olivine in an oceanic environment (b) breakdown of olivine relicts to the deweylite assemblage resulting in mobilization of MgO under (near-) surface conditions in a tropical Devonian climate and (c) further Mg-mobilization and replacement of the deweylite assemblage by calcite and quartz after diagenesis. Sedimentary basins with abundant weathered peridotite represent potential sites for a permanent CO2 storage by formation of calcite in a low-temperature environment. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Fuzzy mixed integer linear program for planning enhanced weathering
AB  - Silicate minerals, which are naturally present in rocks, react with CO2 in the atmosphere to produce solid carbonate minerals or bicarbonate ions dissolved in oceans. In both cases, CO2 is trapped almost indefinitely. More commonly known as weathering, this mechanism is the natural way of moderating the CO2 levels in the atmosphere. In this regard, enhanced weathering which aims to hasten this natural process in order to sequester CO2 within human relevant time scales, has been proposed as a potential strategy towards moderating climate change. This process involves grinding the silicates and applying them on land surfaces to facilitate dissolution. Most experts estimate that the process has the capability of sequestering gigatons of CO2 annually. However, implementing this strategy on an industrial scale will require systematic methodologies to maximize its potential benefits. The property of silicate rocks affects its potential for CO2 sequestration while soil properties can impose limits on its application. Furthermore, estimates for its economic feasibility remain uncertain. A fuzzy mixed integer linear program is developed in this work for planning enhanced weathering networks in consideration of system uncertainties. Results suggest that sequestration potential and application rate largely influences the network structure. Â© 2020, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

TI  - Study of CO2 capture by seawater and its reinforcement
AB  - Numerous coal-fired power plants, cement plants and steel mills are concentrated in coastal areas of China, and are three major CO2 emitters. Seawater may be a potential resource to capture CO2 in coastal areas. In this study, we used seawater as a CO2 absorbent to capture CO2. An online chromatography apparatus was used to determine CO2 solubility in seawater with different temperatures, pressures and salinities. Then, the thermodynamics and kinetics were studied for the influences of temperature and salinity on CO2 capture in seawater. The experimental results show that increasing temperature and salinity were adverse to CO2 capture by seawater because of an increase in Henry's constant from a thermodynamics aspect. The kinetic results show that high temperature and low salinity can increase the CO2 absorption rate. In order to improve the CO2 absorption ability of seawater and promote CO2 fixation in carbonate precipitation, we added CaO as major components of industrial alkaline substances to enhance the seawater absorption of CO2. CO2 solubility in seawater with 0.4\% CaO increased by 79.25\%. It shows that the addition of CaO can enhance greatly seawater capture of CO2. The seawater and its reinforcement with CaO is a potential method to capture CO2. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Land-sea carbon and nutrient fluxes and coastal ocean CO2 exchange and acidification: Past, present, and future
AB  - Epochs of changing atmospheric CO2 and seawater CO2-carbonic acid system chemistry and acidification have occurred during the Phanerozoic at various time scales. On the longer geologic time scale, as sea level rose and fell and continental free board decreased and increased, respectively, the riverine fluxes of Ca, Mg, DIC, and total alkalinity to the coastal ocean varied and helped regulate the C chemistry of seawater, but nevertheless there were major epochs of ocean acidification (OA). On the shorter glacial-interglacial time scale from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to late preindustrial time, riverine fluxes of DIC, total alkalinity, and N and P nutrients increased and along with rising sea level, atmospheric PCO2 and temperature led, among other changes, to a slightly deceasing pH of coastal and open ocean waters, and to increasing net ecosystem calcification and decreasing net heterotrophy in coastal ocean waters. From late preindustrial time to the present and projected into the 21st century, human activities, such as fossil fuel and land-use emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere, increasing application of N and P nutrient subsidies and combustion N to the landscape, and sewage discharges of C, N, P have led, and will continue to lead, to significant modifications of coastal ocean waters. The changes include a rapid decline in pH and carbonate saturation state (modern problem of ocean acidification), a shift toward dissolution of carbonate substrates exceeding production, potentially leading to the " demise" of the coral reefs, reversal of the direction of the sea-to-air flux of CO2 and enhanced biological production and burial of organic C, a small sink of anthropogenic CO2, accompanied by a continuous trend toward increasing autotrophy in coastal waters.

TI  - CO 2 mitigation via accelerated limestone weathering
AB  - Accelerated weathering of limestone (AWL: CO2 2+ + CaCO 3 + H 2O â‡’ Ca 2+ + 2HCO 3 - as a low-tech, inexpensive, high-capacity, environmentally-friendly CO 2 capture and sequestration technology was evaluated. With access to seawater and limestone being essential to this approach, significant limestone resources were close to most CO 2-emitting power plants along the coastal US. Waste fines, representing &gt; 20% of current US crushed limestone production (&gt; 10 9 tons/yr), could be used as an inexpensive source of AWL carbonate. AWL end-solution disposal in the ocean would significantly reduce effects on ocean pH and carbonate chemistry relative to those caused by direct atmospheric or ocean CO 2 disposal. Indeed, the increase in ocean Ca 2+ and bicarbonate offered by AWL should enhance growth of corals and other calcifying marine organisms.

TI  - Ocean-Based Carbon Dioxide Removal: A New Frontier in the Blue Economy
AB  - The ocean is a key facet of climate stability and Earthâ€™s carbon cycle. Given the immense scale of atmospheric carbon dioxide removal (CDR) necessary to achieve international climate goals, ocean-based CDR approaches (or â€œocean CDRâ€) warrant serious consideration. Ocean CDR is a still nascent, but cautiously promising, area of scientific research with several approaches under evaluation. Here, we examine one of the most promising approaches, ocean alkalinity enhancement, to highlight and exemplify challenges and opportunities of an emerging ocean CDR industry in the blue economy.

TI  - Environmental and health impacts of atmospheric CO2 removal by enhanced rock weathering depend on nations' energy mix
AB  - Enhanced rock weathering is competitive with other carbon sequestration strategies in terms of land, energy and water use with its overall sustainability dependent on that of the energy system supplying it, according to a process-based life cycle assessment. Enhanced Rock Weathering is a proposed Carbon Dioxide Removal technology involving the application of crushed silicate rocks, such as basalt, to agricultural soils with potential co-benefits for crops and soils, and mitigation of ocean acidification. Here we address the requirement of diverse stakeholders for informative studies quantifying possible environmental and health risks of Enhanced Rock Weathering. Using life-cycle assessment modelling of potential supply chain impacts for twelve nations undertaking Enhanced Rock Weathering deployment to deliver up to net 2 Gt CO2 y(r-1) CDR, we find that rock grinding rather than mining exerts the dominant influence on environmental impacts. This finding holds under both a business-as-usual and clean energy mix scenario to 2050 but transitioning to undertaking Enhanced Rock Weathering in the future with low carbon energy systems improves the sustainability of the Enhanced Rock Weathering supply chain. We find that Enhanced Rock Weathering is competitive with other large-scale Carbon Dioxide Removal strategies in terms of energy and water demands.

TI  - Carbon capture via accelerated weathering of limestone: Modeling local impacts on the carbonate chemistry of the southern North Sea
AB  - Human activities are responsible for a > 45 \% rise of atmospheric CO2 since the industrial revolution started; burning of fossil fuels being the largest source. Via accelerated weathering of limestone (AWL), CO2 can be captured from effluent gas streams and stored in the marine environment primarily in the form of bicarbonate. We studied the CO2 storage capacity and how AWL-derived water impacts the carbonate chemistry of the southern North Sea. Therefor, a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model was coupled with a sub-module to model the carbonate chemistry. We studied three scenarios: 1) scrubbing effluent gas streams of a combined heat and power plant (60 kW), 2) scrubbing 10 \% or 3) 100 \% of the flue gas of a coal-fired power plant (750 MW). Whereas, impacts on seawater carbonate chemistry due to AWL discharge were imperceptible in the first scenario, a maximum change in pH(T) and calcite saturation state of 0.1 and 0.6 was found in scenario 2. In scenario 3, the decrease in pH(T) exceeded 1 around the discharge site and the calcite saturation state reached 8 in large parts of the Jade Bay, posing the possibility of significant impacts on the marine ecosystem. Abiotic precipitation of calcite might occur around the discharge site. In all three scenarios, 50 \% of the captured CO2 re-entered the atmosphere after the simulated time period of one year. This study shows that care is needed in siting, sizing and operating AWL facilities to maximize climate and ocean ecosystem benefits while minimizing negative environmental impacts.

TI  - Response of soil carbon fractions and enzyme activities to mowing management on in a coastal wetland of the yellow river delta
AB  - Coastal wetlands are considered as important ``blue carbon{''} sink, and mowing management induced by anthropogenic activities is anticipated to profoundly affect soil carbon stocks in coastal wetlands. However, the impacts of mowing management on soil organic carbon (SOC) and enzyme activities and the mechanisms responsible for associated changes in Phragmites australis wetland remain uncertain. We conducted a field mowing manipulation experiment {[}control (CK), mowing and returning straw in December (12MS), mowing and removing straw in December (12MR), mowing and returning straw in March (3MS), and mowing and removing straw in March (3MR)] in P. australis wetland of the Yellow River Delta and quantified their impacts on soil quality, SOC, SOC fractions, and enzyme activities. Results showed that mowing treatments led to overall increases in soil nutrients {[}total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), NH4+, and NO3-] and decreases in soil C/N ratio. The effects of mowing treatments on soil nutrient content were pronounced on topsoil than deep soil, and the maximum value of TC, TN, and TP reached in the 12MR treatment. Compared with CK, the 12MS, 12MR, 3MS, and 3MR treatments at 0-10 cm depth significantly enhanced SOC content by 8.78\%, 32.9\%, 16.5\%, and 30.1\%, respectively, but only the 3MS treatment enhanced SOC by 16.5\% at 10-20 cm depth. Mowing treatments increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), particulate organic carbon (POC), and labile organic carbon (LOC) and the contents of DOC, MBC, POC, and LOC decreased with soil depth. Mowing treatments stimulated the activities of sucrase and urease in topsoil, but only the 3MR treatment improved alkaline phosphatase activity in topsoil. Path analysis indicated that mowing management dominantly modulates SOC by changing sucrase activity, alkaline phosphatase activity, TN, TP, NH4+, NO3-, DOC, and LOC in 0-10 cm depth. However, SOC was significantly controlled by sucrase activity, urease activity, TC, TN, TP, LOC, and POC in 10-20 cm depth. Collectively, our results indicate that the continuous mowing management is beneficial to enhance soil quality and carbon storage capacity of P. australis wetlands, which will contribute to enhance carbon sequestration and sink capacity of coastal wetlands.

TI  - Potential of enhanced weathering of calcite in packed bubble columns with seawater for carbon dioxide removal
AB  - Enhanced weathering of minerals is one option being considered for removing CO2 from the atmosphere to help combat climate change. In this work, we consider the weathering of calcite with seawater in a reactor using air enriched with CO2. A mathematical model of the packed bubble column reactor was constructed with the key mass transfer and chemical reaction components validated with experimental data. The modelling results for a continuous process reveal the performance in terms of the specific energy consumption and the CO2 capture rate, which are affected by parameters including particle size, superficial velocities of gas and liquid, reactor bed height and feed CO2 concentration. The major energy requirements are for pumping liquid and compressing gas, and for CO2 enrichment; energy needed for supplying solid particles (mining operations, transport and comminution) was found to be comparatively minor. A trade-off was possible between ground area requirement (determined by CO2 capture rate) and energy requirement. To capture 1 tonne of CO2 at the reactor, optimal designs were predicted to consume 2.1-2.3 GJ of electricity and occupy 1.8-5.2 m(2) year of space, depending on the feed CO2 concentration. These would increase to 5.7-8.2 GJ and 7.1-13.1 m(2) year per tonne of CO2 captured, after allowing for degassing of the weathering product in the ocean. This increased energy intensity is still within the range of the CO(2 )removal options previously reported, while the space requirement quantification provides essential information for future feasibility assessment of this scheme.

TI  - Potential ecotoxicological effects of elevated bicarbonate ion concentrations on marine organisms
AB  - Recently, a novel method for carbon capture and storage has been proposed, which converts gaseous CO2 into aqueous bicarbonate ions (HCO3âˆ’), allowing it to be deposited into the ocean. This alkalinization method could be used to dispose large amounts of CO2 without acidifying seawater pH, but there is no information on the potential adverse effects of consequently elevated HCO3âˆ’ concentrations on marine organisms. In this study, we evaluated the ecotoxicological effects of elevated concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) (max 193 mM) on 10 marine organisms. We found species-specific ecotoxicological effects of elevated DIC on marine organisms, with EC50-DIC (causing 50% inhibition) of 11â€“85 mM. The tentative criteria for protecting 80% of individuals of marine organisms are suggested to be pH 7.8 and 11 mM DIC, based on acidification data previously documented and alkalinization data newly obtained from this study. Overall, the results of this study are useful for providing baseline information on ecotoxicological effects of elevated DIC on marine organisms. More complementary studies are needed on the alkalinization method to determine DIC effects on seawater chemistry and marine organisms. â€œMarine organisms could be affected by elevated concentrations of bicarbonate ions in seawater produced via the alkalinization method.â€ Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Using seawater-based Na2CO3 medium for scrubbing the CO2 released from Bio-CNG plant for enhanced biomass production of Pseudanabaena limnetica
AB  - The concentration of CO2, one of the most important greenhouse gases (GHG), has reached to 409.8 Â± 0.1Â ppm in 2019. Although there are many carbon capture and storage (CCS) methods, they are very costly and their long term use raises concern about environmental safety. Alternatively, bio-sequestration of CO2 using microalgal cell factories has emerged as a promising way of recycling CO2 into biomass via photosynthesis. In the present study, Indigenous algal strain Pseudanabaena limnetica was cultivated in pneumatically agitated 60-L flat-panel photobioreactor system. The gas was released from Bio-CNG plant as by-product into Na2CO3-rich medium and cultivated in semicontinuous mode of operation. It was observed that when CO2 was sparged in seawater-based 0.02Â M Na2CO3 solution, maximum CO2 was dissolved in the system and was used for algal cultivation. Control system produced 0.64 Â± 0.035Â g/L of biomass at the end of 15Â days, whereas CO2 sparged Na2CO3 medium produced 0.81 Â± 0.046Â g/L of biomass. When CO2 from Bio-CNG station was fed, it resulted in biomass production of 1.62 Â± 0.070Â g/L at the end of 18Â days compared to 1.46 Â± 0.066Â g/L of biomass produced in control system which was not fed with gas released from Bio-CNG plant as by-product. Thus, feeding CO2 directly into Na2CO3 medium and operating the system semicontinuously would be efficient for scrubbing CO2 from commercial Bio-CNG plant. This study proves that feeding CO2 gas from Bio-CNG plant into Na2CO3-rich alkaline system can be used to feed algae for enhanced biomass production. Â© 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Negative CO2 emissions via enhanced silicate weathering in coastal environments
AB  - Negative emission technologies (NETs) target the removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, and are being actively investigated as a strategy to limit global warming to within the 1.5-2 degrees C targets of the 2015 UN climate agreement. Enhanced silicate weathering (ESW) proposes to exploit the natural process of mineral weathering for the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. Here, we discuss the potential of applying ESW in coastal environments as a climate change mitigation option. By deliberately introducing fast-weathering silicate minerals onto coastal sediments, alkalinity is released into the overlying waters, thus creating a coastal CO2 sink. Compared with other NETs, coastal ESW has the advantage that it counteracts ocean acidification, does not interfere with terrestrial land use and can be directly integrated into existing coastal management programmes with existing (dredging) technology. Yet presently, the concept is still at an early stage, and so two major research challenges relate to the efficiency and environmental impact of ESW. Dedicated experiments are needed (i) to more precisely determine the weathering rate under in situ conditions within the seabed and (ii) to evaluate the ecosystem impacts-both positive and negative-from the released weathering products.

TI  - Current Status and Potential Assessment of China's Ocean Carbon Sinks
AB  - The role of ocean carbon sinks in global climate change mitigation and carbon neutrality is still affected by lack of research. Aiming at overcoming the present limitations, a comprehensive and holistic framework and accounting method of ocean carbon sink evaluation are proposed in this study, which consider both carbon sink types and their characteristic carbon storage cycle timescales. The results show that (1) China's total ocean carbon sink is 69.83-106.46 Tg C/year, among which the mariculture, coastal wetlands, and offshore carbon sinks are 2.27-4.06, 2.86-5.85, and 64.70-96.55 Tg C/year, respectively; (2) ocean-based solutions such as coastal protection and restoration, mariculture development, ocean alkalization, ocean fertilization, and marine bioenergy with carbon capture and storage have substantial mitigation potential, but further investigation is required before large-scale deployment; (3) although China's ocean carbon sinks only counterbalanced 3.27-4.99% of its fossil fuel emissions, their tremendous enhancing potential and specific advantages cannot be ignored, and enhancing measures must be taken according to regional characteristics; (4) some uncertainties and limitations still exist, and problems such as double counting, carbon sink offset, and so forth need to be further considered. In a word, this study provides a basis for the development of ocean-based solutions on closing climate mitigation gaps. Â© 2022 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Potential and costs of carbon dioxide removal by enhanced weathering of rocks
AB  - The chemical weathering of rocks currently absorbs about 1.1 Gt CO2 a-1 being mainly stored as bicarbonate in the ocean. An enhancement of this slow natural process could remove substantial amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere, aiming to offset some unavoidable anthropogenic emissions in order to comply with the Paris Agreement, while at the same time it may decrease ocean acidification. We provide the first comprehensive assessment of economic costs, energy requirements, technical parameterization, and global and regional carbon removal potential. The crucial parameters defining this potential are the grain size and weathering rates. The main uncertainties about the potential relate to weathering rates and rock mass that can be integrated into the soil. The discussed results do not specifically address the enhancement of weathering through microbial processes, feedback of geogenic nutrient release, and bioturbation. We do not only assess dunite rock, predominantly bearing olivine (in the form of forsterite) as the mineral that has been previously proposed to be best suited for carbon removal, but focus also on basaltic rock to minimize potential negative side effects. Our results show that enhanced weathering is an option for carbon dioxide removal that could be competitive already at 60 US $ t-1 CO2 removed for dunite, but only at 200 US $ t-1 CO2 removed for basalt. The potential carbon removal on cropland areas could be as large as 95 Gt CO2 a-1 for dunite and 4.9 Gt CO2 a-1 for basalt. The best suited locations are warm and humid areas, particularly in India, Brazil, South-East Asia and China, where almost 75% of the global potential can be realized. This work presents a techno-economic assessment framework, which also allows for the incorporation of further processes. Â© 2018 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - The Sensitivity of the Marine Carbonate System to Regional Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement
AB  - Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) simultaneously mitigates atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and ocean acidification; however, no previous studies have investigated the response of the non-linear marine carbonate system sensitivity to alkalinity enhancement on regional scales. We hypothesise that regional implementations of OAE can sequester more atmospheric CO2 than a global implementation. To address this, we investigate physical regimes and alkalinity sensitivity as drivers of the carbon-uptake potential response to global and different regional simulations of OAE. In this idealised ocean-only set-up, total alkalinity is enhanced at a rate of 0.25 Pmol a-1 in 75-year simulations using the Max Planck Institute Ocean Model coupled to the HAMburg Ocean Carbon Cycle model with pre-industrial atmospheric forcing. Alkalinity is enhanced globally and in eight regions: the Subpolar and Subtropical Atlantic and Pacific gyres, the Indian Ocean and the Southern Ocean. This study reveals that regional alkalinity enhancement has the capacity to exceed carbon uptake by global OAE. We find that 82â€“175 Pg more carbon is sequestered into the ocean when alkalinity is enhanced regionally and 156 PgC when enhanced globally, compared with the background-state. The Southern Ocean application is most efficient, sequestering 12% more carbon than the Global experiment despite OAE being applied across a surface area 40 times smaller. For the first time, we find that different carbon-uptake potentials are driven by the surface pattern of total alkalinity redistributed by physical regimes across areas of different carbon-uptake efficiencies. We also show that, while the marine carbonate system becomes less sensitive to alkalinity enhancement in all experiments globally, regional responses to enhanced alkalinity vary depending upon the background concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity. Furthermore, the Subpolar North Atlantic displays a previously unexpected alkalinity sensitivity increase in response to high total alkalinity concentrations.

TI  - Life cycle assessment of ocean liming for carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere
AB  - The world's oceans are an important part of the global carbon cycle, having already absorbed one-quarter of the anthropogenic carbon emissions, however, at the expense of surface ocean acidity, which has increased around 30% since the Industrial Revolution, affecting marine ecosystems. Ocean liming, whereby particulate calcium oxide or, more likely, hydroxide is spread to surface ocean waters can address, at least partly, both the need for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and ocean acidification. While the idea was proposed almost three decades ago, previous studies have focused on techno-economic feasibility but not on environmental sustainability. Life cycle assessment revealed that limestone calcination is the main environmental hotspot followed by the capture and storage of the calcination CO2 emissions. Mining, comminution, and hydration had a small impact, while results were sensitive to the kiln technology, fuel type, electricity mix, and transportation. Differences between the carbon and environmental footprint highlight that multi-issue life cycle impact assessment methods may be more appropriate when assessing CDR rather than only using carbon balances. Clean and energy efficient kilns (e.g., solar calciners) and the use of renewable energy optimize the system's environmental performance (total carbon and environmental footprint âˆ’1031 kgCO2eq and âˆ’15.1 Pt per ton of lime spread in the ocean, respectively). The valorisation of the CO2 emissions from limestone calcination, e.g., for fuels, chemicals, or plastics production, could potentially further improve ocean liming's environmental profile, through avoided emissions, however net removal would depend on the longevity of the use. Results imply that CO2 removal at the Gt yr.âˆ’1 scale can be achieved, however more research is required on the biological and ecological implications of this CDR approach. Â© 2022 The Authors

TI  - Life cycle assessment of carbon dioxide removal technologies: a critical review
AB  - A large number of prospective climate scenarios rely on Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technologies to limit global warming below 2 degrees C. To date, however, a comprehensive understanding of the overall life-cycle environmental impacts of CDR technologies is missing. We present a critical review on conducted Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) of a comprehensive set of CDR technologies: afforestation and reforestation, biochar, soil carbon sequestration, enhanced weathering, ocean fertilisation, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, and direct air carbon capture and storage. One of the key observations is that emissions avoided due to substitution of certain processes (due to system expansion in LCA) can be easily misinterpreted as negative emissions, i.e. as carbon removal from the atmosphere. Based on the observed inconsistencies and shortcomings, we recommend to interpret available CDR LCA results with caution. To improve the understanding of environmental implications of CDR deployment, we recommend (1) to conduct LCAs with multiple environmental impact categories, (2) to consider the temporal aspect of emissions in biomass-related CDR technologies, (3) to focus on so far overlooked CDR technologies, (4) to be as transparent as possible regarding methodological choices, (5) to capture environmental side-effects, and (6) to distinguish between `avoided emissions' and `negative emissions' - only negative emissions correspond to permanent removal from the atmosphere. We conclude that more comprehensive and rigorous LCAs are needed to help inform the design of CDR technology portfolios and to aid in anticipatory governance.

TI  - Sequestration and subduction of deep-sea carbonate in the global ocean since the Early Cretaceous
AB  - Deep-sea carbonate represents Earth's largest carbon sink and one of the least-known components of the long-term carbon cycle that is intimately linked to climate. By coupling the deep-sea carbonate sedimentation history to a global tectonic model, we quantify this component within the framework of a continuously evolving seafloor. A long-term increase in marine carbonate carbon flux since the mid-Cretaceous is dominated by a post-50 Ma doubling of carbonate accumulation to ~310 Mt C/yr at present-day. This increase was caused largely by the immense growth in deep-sea carbonate carbon storage, post-dating the end of the Early Eocene Climate Optimum. We suggest that a combination of a retreat of epicontinental seas, underpinned by long-term deepening of the seafloor, the inception of major Himalayan river systems, and the weathering of the Deccan Traps drove enhanced delivery of Ca2+ and HCO3 - into the oceans and atmospheric CO2 drawdown in the 15 m.y. prior to the onset of glaciation at ca. 35 Ma. Relatively stagnant mid-ocean ridge, riftand subduction-related degassing during this period support our contention that continental silicate weathering, rather than a major decrease in CO2 degassing, may have triggered an increase in marine carbonate accumulation and long-term Eocene global cooling. Our results provide new constraints for global carbon cycle models, and may improve our understanding of carbonate subduction-related metamorphism, mineralization and isotopic signatures of degassing.

TI  - The role of soils in the regulation of ocean acidification
AB  - Soils play an important role in mediating chemical weathering reactions and carbon transfer from the land to the ocean. Proposals to increase the contribution of alkalinity to the oceans through 'enhanced weathering' as a means to help prevent climate change are gaining increasing attention. This would augment the existing connection between the biogeochemical function of soils and alkalinity levels in the ocean. The feasibility of enhanced weathering depends on the combined influence of what minerals are added to soils, the formation of secondary minerals in soils and the drainage regime, and the partial pressure of respired CO 2 around the dissolving mineral. Increasing the alkalinity levels in the ocean through enhanced weathering could help to ameliorate the effects of ocean acidification in two ways. First, enhanced weathering would slightly elevate the pH of drainage waters, and the receiving coastal waters. The elevated pH would result in an increase in carbonate mineral saturation states, and a partial reversal in the effects of elevated CO 2. Second, the increase in alkalinity would help to replenish the ocean's buffering capacity by maintaining the 'Revelle Factor', making the oceans more resilient to further CO 2 emissions. However, there is limited research on the downstream and oceanic impacts of enhanced weathering on which to base deployment decisions.

TI  - Reduction process of CO2 emissions by treating with waste concrete via an artificial weathering process
AB  - A new process of treatment of waste concrete for reduction of CO2 emission is proposed. The process is based on a physical weathering reaction accelerated by acetic acid. The main part of the process was comprised of the following two steps: (1) extraction of Ca2+ from waste concrete particles by acetic acid in the form of calcium acetate, 3CaO.SiO2.3H(2)O.3Ca(OH)(2)+12CH(3)COOH --> 6Ca(2+) + 12CH(3)COO(-) +3SiO(2) + 12H(2)O and (2) deposition of calcium carbonate particles (CaCO3) by CO2 injection into the calcium acetate solution. Acetic acid will be released in the deposition step, and recycled to the extraction step. Ca(CH3COO)(2)(aq) + CO2, H2O, CaCO3 + 2CH(3)COOH Feasibility of the process as a CO2 emission reduction scenario was examined from the viewpoints of energy consumption and reduction potential of CO2 emission based on the experimental results on the reaction kinetics of each step. It was found that energy consumption for the process was 14 MW when all the CO2 emitted from a 100 MW thermal power plant was treated by the process, which would be as comparable with that for ocean sequestration options.

AB  - We investigate the climate mitigation potential and collateral effects of direct injections of captured CO2 into the deep ocean as a possible means to close the gap between an intermediate CO2 emissions scenario and a specific temperature target, such as the 1.5 Â°C target aimed for by the Paris Agreement. For that purpose, a suite of approaches for controlling the amount of direct CO2 injections at 3000m water depth are implemented in an Earth system model of intermediate complexity. Following the representative concentration pathway RCP4.5, which is a medium mitigation CO2 emissions scenario, cumulative CO2 injections required to meet the 1.5 Â°C climate goal are found to be 390 Gt C by the year 2100 and 1562 Gt C at the end of simulations, by the year 3020. The latter includes a cumulative leakage of 602 GtC that needs to be reinjected in order to sustain the targeted global mean temperature. CaCO3 sediment and weathering feedbacks reduce the required CO2 injections that comply with the 1.5 Â°C target by about 13% in 2100 and by about 11% at the end of the simulation. With respect to the injection-related impacts we find that average pH values in the surface ocean are increased by about 0.13 to 0.18 units, when compared to the control run. In the model, this results in significant increases in potential coral reef habitats, i.e., the volume of the global upper ocean (0 to 130m depth) with omega aragonite &gt;3.4 and ocean temperatures between 21 and 28 Â°C, compared to the control run. The potential benefits in the upper ocean come at the expense of strongly acidified water masses at depth, with maximum pH reductions of about -2.37 units, relative to preindustrial levels, in the vicinity of the injection sites. Overall, this study demonstrates that massive amounts of CO2 would need to be injected into the deep ocean in order to reach and maintain the 1.5 Â°C climate target in a medium mitigation scenario on a millennium timescale, and that there is a trade-off between injection-related reductions in atmospheric CO2 levels accompanied by reduced upper-ocean acidification and adverse effects on deep-ocean chemistry, particularly near the injection sites.

TI  - Enhanced carbonate and silicate weathering accelerates recovery from fossil fuel CO2 perturbations
AB  - Increasing atmospheric CO2 and surface temperatures should increase carbonate and silicate weathering rates, directly via warming, and indirectly via the CO2 fertilization effect enhancing plant productivity. Enhanced weathering should in turn increase alkalinity input to the ocean and accelerate long-term CO2 uptake. We added silicate and carbonate weathering and carbonate sediments to an existing global carbon cycle and surface temperature model and subjected it to a range of long-term fossil fuel emissions scenarios, spanning 1100-15,000 GtC in total. Emissions ofâ‰¥7350 GtC dissolve all carbonate sediments, and enhanced carbonate and silicate weathering accelerate subsequent CO2 removal from the atmosphere by up to a factor of 4. For 1100-4000 GtC emissions, enhanced weathering accelerates CO2 removal by a factor of 1.5-2.5. However, it takes &gt;1 Myr for silicate weathering to stabilize atmospheric CO 2. If land use tends to suppress vegetation and weathering rates on this timescale, then CO2 will stabilize above preindustrial levels. Copyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.

TI  - Destabilization of carbon in tropical peatlands by enhanced weathering
AB  - Enhanced weathering is a carbon dioxide (CO2) removal strategy that accelerates the CO2 uptake and removal from the atmosphere by weathering via the dispersion of rock powder. Warm and humid conditions enhance weathering and among the suggested target areas for enhanced weathering are tropical peatlands. However, the effect of enhanced weathering on peatland carbon stocks is poorly understood. Here, we present estimates for the response of CO2 emissions from tropical peat soils, rivers and coastal waters to changing soil acidity induced by enhanced weathering application. We estimate that the potential carbon uptake associated with enhanced weathering is reduced by 18-60\% by land-based re-emission of CO2 and is potentially offset completely by emissions from coastal waters. Our findings suggest that in contrast to the desired impact, enhanced weathering may destabilize the natural carbon cycle in tropical peatlands that act as important carbon sinks and protect against coastal erosion. Enhanced weathering in tropical peatlands may be an ineffective carbon dioxide removal strategy due to pH-induced increases in soil carbon leaching which lead to increased re-emission of carbon, according to model calculations constrained by observations from Sumatra, Indonesia.

TI  - Reducing CO2 Emissions of a Coal-Fired Power Plant via Accelerated Weathering of Limestone: Carbon Capture Efficiency and Environmental Safety
AB  - Reducing CO2 emissions is a key task of modern society to attenuate climate change and its environmental effects. Accelerated weathering of limestone (AWL) has been proposed as a tool to capture CO2 from effluent gas streams and store it primarily as bicarbonate in the marine environment. We evaluated the performance of the biggest AWL-reactor to date that was installed at a coal-fired power plant in Germany. Depending on the gas flow rate, approximately 55% of the CO2 could be removed from the flue gas. The generated product water was characterized by an up to 5-fold increase in alkalinity, which indicates the successful weathering of limestone and the long-term storage of the captured CO2. A rise of potentially harmful substances in the product water (NO2 -, NOx -, NH4 +, SO4 2-, and heavy metals) or in unreacted limestone particles (heavy metals) to levels of environmental concern could not be observed, most likely as a result of a desulfurization of the flue gas before it entered the AWL reactor. At locations where limestone and water availability is high, AWL could be used for a safe and long-term storage of CO2 Copyright Â© 2020 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Assessing carbon dioxide removal through global and regional ocean alkalinization under high and low emission pathways
AB  - Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels continue to rise, increasing the risk of severe impacts on the Earth system, and on the ecosystem services that it provides. Artificial ocean alkalinization (AOA) is capable of reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and surface warming and addressing ocean acidification. Here, we simulate global and regional responses to alkalinity (ALK) addition (0.25gPmolALKgyrg;'1) over the period 2020-2100 using the CSIRO-Mk3L-COAL Earth System Model, under high (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5; RCP8.5) and low (RCP2.6) emissions. While regionally there are large changes in alkalinity associated with locations of AOA, globally we see only a very weak dependence on where and when AOA is applied. On a global scale, while we see that under RCP2.6 the carbon uptake associated with AOA is only g;1/4 60g% of the total, under RCP8.5 the relative changes in temperature are larger, as are the changes in pH (140g%) and aragonite saturation state (170g%). The simulations reveal AOA is more effective under lower emissions, therefore the higher the emissions the more AOA is required to achieve the same reduction in global warming and ocean acidification. Finally, our simulated AOA for 2020-2100 in the RCP2.6 scenario is capable of offsetting warming and ameliorating ocean acidification increases at the global scale, but with highly variable regional responses.

TI  - Assessing ocean alkalinity for carbon sequestration
AB  - Over the coming century humanity may need to find reservoirs to store several trillions of tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from fossil fuel combustion, which would otherwise cause dangerous climate change if it were left in the atmosphere. Carbon storage in the ocean as bicarbonate ions (by increasing ocean alkalinity) has received very little attention. Yet recent work suggests sufficient capacity to sequester copious quantities of CO2. It may be possible to sequester hundreds of billions to trillions of tons of C without surpassing postindustrial average carbonate saturation states in the surface ocean. When globally distributed, the impact of elevated alkalinity is potentially small and may help ameliorate the effects of ocean acidification. However, the local impact around addition sites may be more acute but is specific to the mineral and technology. The alkalinity of the ocean increases naturally because of rock weathering in which &gt;1.5Â mol of carbon are removed from the atmosphere for every mole of magnesium or calcium dissolved from silicate minerals (e.g., wollastonite, olivine, and anorthite) and 0.5Â mol for carbonate minerals (e.g., calcite and dolomite). These processes are responsible for naturally sequestering 0.5 billion tons of CO2 per year. Alkalinity is reduced in the ocean through carbonate mineral precipitation, which is almost exclusively formed from biological activity. Most of the previous work on the biological response to changes in carbonate chemistry have focused on acidifying conditions. More research is required to understand carbonate precipitation at elevated alkalinity to constrain the longevity of carbon storage. A range of technologies have been proposed to increase ocean alkalinity (accelerated weathering of limestone, enhanced weathering, electrochemical promoted weathering, and ocean liming), the cost of which may be comparable to alternative carbon sequestration proposals (e.g., $20â€“100Â tCO2 âˆ’1). There are still many unanswered technical, environmental, social, and ethical questions, but the scale of the carbon sequestration challenge warrants research to address these. Â©2017.

TI  - Transformation of abundant magnesium silicate minerals for enhanced CO2 sequestration
AB  - Global climate change related to anthropogenic CO2 emissions is one of the most significant challenges for the future of human life on Earth. There are many potential options for reducing or even eliminating atmospheric CO2 emissions including underground sequestration, carbon mineralization and ocean storage. One of the most promising materials for carbon mineralization is Mg(OH)(2) which is highly reactive and capable of forming stable carbonates. Here we show a novel low-carbon method of producing Mg(OH)(2), from globally abundant olivine-rich silicate rocks. A combination of acid digestion and electrolysis of olivine were used to produce Mg(OH)(2) in a fully recoverable system. The use of Mg(OH)(2) from olivine provides a viable pathway for significant industrial scale reductions in global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Magnesium hydroxide is a sustainable material for CO2 sequestration, according to an acid digestion and electrolysis method using olivine-rich silicate rocks in a fully recoverable system.

TI  - Influence of terrestrial weathering on ocean acidification and the next glacial inception
AB  - Ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 causes a decline in seawater pH, a process known as ocean acidification, which may adversely affect marine organisms. We investigate whether continental weathering can mitigate future ocean acidification by sequestering atmospheric CO2. We conducted simulations under a suite of carbon emission scenarios with different weathering parameterizations. The short-term impact of a strong weathering feedback was only notable for large emissions with slow injection. This mitigation by enhanced weathering, however, is an order of magnitude smaller than the expected maximum pH decline based on the default parameterizations. Thus on short timescales, weathering has little effect on future atmospheric CO2 and ocean acidification, regardless of the assumed weathering feedback strength. But on longer timescales and for large emissions, different weathering parameterizations introduce large uncertainties regarding the time when pCO 2 will return to climatically relevant levels of, say, 400 Î¼atm in the future.

TI  - Model-Based Assessment of the CO2 Sequestration Potential of Coastal Ocean Alkalinization
AB  - The potential of coastal ocean alkalinization (COA), a carbon dioxide removal (CDR) climate engineering strategy that chemically increases ocean carbon uptake and storage, is investigated with an Earth system model of intermediate complexity. The CDR potential and possible environmental side effects are estimated for various COA deployment scenarios, assuming olivine as the alkalinity source in ice-free coastal waters (about 8.6% of the global ocean's surface area), with dissolution rates being a function of grain size, ambient seawater temperature, and pH. Our results indicate that for a large-enough olivine deployment of small-enough grain sizes (10 Âµm), atmospheric CO2 could be reduced by more than 800 GtC by the year 2100. However, COA with coarse olivine grains (1000 Âµm) has little CO2 sequestration potential on this time scale. Ambitious CDR with fine olivine grains would increase coastal aragonite saturation Î© to levels well beyond those that are currently observed. When imposing upper limits for aragonite saturation levels (Î©lim) in the grid boxes subject to COA (Î©lim = 3.4 and 9 chosen as examples), COA still has the potential to reduce atmospheric CO2 by 265 GtC (Î©lim = 3.4) to 790 GtC (Î©lim = 9) and increase ocean carbon storage by 290 Gt (Î©lim = 3.4) to 913 Gt (Î©lim = 9) by year 2100.

TI  - Kinetics of Olivine Weathering in Seawater: An Experimental Study
AB  - Enhanced weathering of mafic and ultra-mafic minerals has been suggested as a strategy for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and a contribution to achieve a balance between global CO2 sources and sinks (net zero emission). This study was designed to assess CDR by dissolution of ultramafic sand (UMS) in artificial seawater (ASW). Fine grained UMS with an olivine content of ~75% was reacted in ASW for up to 134 days at 1 bar and 21.5â€“23.9Â°C. A decline in total alkalinity (TA) was observed over the course of the experiments. This unexpected result indicates that TA removal via precipitation of cation-rich authigenic phases exceeded the production of TA induced by olivine dissolution. The TA decline was accompanied by a decrease in dissolved inorganic carbon and Ca concentrations presumably induced by CaCO3 precipitation. Temporal changes in dissolved Si, Ca, Mg, and TA concentrations observed during the experiments were evaluated by a numerical model to identify secondary mineral phases and quantify rates of authigenic phase formation. The modeling indicates that CaCO3, FeOOH and a range of Mg-Si-phases were precipitated during the experiments. Chemical analysis of precipitates and reacted UMS surfaces confirmed that these authigenic phases accumulated in the batch reactors. Nickel released during olivine dissolution, a potential toxic element for certain organisms, was incorporated in the secondary phases and is thus not a suitable proxy for dissolution rates as proposed by earlier studies. The overall reaction stoichiometry derived from lab experiments was applied in a box model simulating atmospheric CO2 uptake in a continental shelf setting induced by olivine addition. The model results indicate that CO2 uptake is reduced by a factor of 5 due to secondary mineral formation and the buffering capacity of seawater. In comparable natural settings, olivine addition may thus be a less efficient CDR method than previously believed. Copyright Â© 2022 Fuhr, Geilert, Schmidt, Liebetrau, Vogt, Ledwig and Wallmann.

TI  - CO2 Removal With Enhanced Weathering and Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement: Potential Risks and Co-benefits for Marine Pelagic Ecosystems
AB  - Humankind will need to remove hundreds of gigatons of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere by the end of the twenty-first century to keep global warming below 2Â°C within the constraints of the global carbon budget. However, so far it is unclear if and how this could be achieved. A widely recognized idea is to accelerate weathering reactions of minerals that consume CO2 when they dissolve. Acceleration could be realized by pulverizing and distributing gigatons of these minerals onto land (termed â€œenhanced weathering (EW)â€) or sea (termed â€œocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE)â€) thereby largely increasing their reactive surfaces. However, the desired consumption of atmospheric CO2 during dissolution would inevitably be accompanied by a release of mineral dissolution products (alkalinity, Si, Ca, Mg, Fe, Ni, and maybe others). Here, we approximate their maximum additions to assess potential consequences for pelagic communities (mainly primary producers) and the biogeochemical fluxes they control. Based on this assessment, we tentatively qualify the potential to induce positive and/or negative side effects to be high for Fe, Ni, Si, intermediate for alkalinity, and low for Ca and Mg. However, perturbation potentials are always higher at perturbation hotspots and would be different for EW than for OAE. Furthermore, ecological/biogeochemical consequences of EW/OAE largely depend on the minerals used. We hypothesize that mainly calcifiers would profit in a scheme where CaCO3 derivatives would be used due to beneficial changes in carbonate chemistry. Figuratively, this may turn the blue ocean into a white(r) ocean. When using silicates, the release of additional Si, Fe and Ni could benefit silicifiers and N2-fixers (cyanobacteria) and increase ocean productivity ultimately turning the blue ocean into a green(er) ocean. These considerations call for dedicated research to assess risks and co-benefits of mineral dissolution products on marine and other environments. Indeed, both EW and OAE could become important tools to realize CO2 removal at the planetary scale but associated risks and/or co-benefits should be revealed before deciding on their implementation.

TI  - Wave Environment Characterization for Scaled Ocean Test Sites
AB  - This paper describes the characterization process for a scaled offshore renewable energy test site. In order to meet the International Panel on Climate Change targets to limit emissions, we will undoubtedly have to turn more to renewable energy sources [1]. As the potential of offshore energy is estimated to be up to twice the global electricity demand [2], investing in streamlining the development and testing of offshore renewable energy devices would help speed up carbon emission reductions. The need to test scale model prototypes before full-scale deployments is becoming a necessary step in the path towards commercialization. Early stage development testing of these devices is often carried out in laboratory basins, which can offer a controlled scaled environment, but they are not able to replicate the truly harsh environmental conditions of the ocean, including weathering, rusting, biofouling and climate. If an intermediary step of testing a scaled offshore device in the marine environment is added to the commercialization process, unexpected issues that arise due the environmental conditions would be much less costly and time consuming to remedy. Additionally, data obtained from different model test methods lack comparability [14]. This paper aims to provide a method that can be used to characterize scaled ocean test sites and identify a scale ratio that can be used to inform testing at the scaled ocean test site. The case study location for this work is in a semi-sheltered bay off of the Gulf of Maine which is referred to as the Castine Scaled Ocean Test Site (CSOTS). The site is characterized using a cross-shore array of Sofar Spotter Buoys to collect data on environmental conditions (Figure 1). Â© 2022 IEEE.

TI  - Accelerated Weathering of Limestone for CO2 Mitigation
AB  - Rock weathering is a natural phenomenon which brings about several changes on the Earth's landscape but it has one more useful function. It controls the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere by precipitating the magnesium and calcium carbonates. The process is slow and takes place over a long period of time. However, if this process is accelerated, the atmospheric CO2 can be removed in sufficient volumes at a faster rate and converted to bicarbonates thus mitigating the greenhouse effect. A geochemistry-based capture and sequestration process that reacts CO2 with water to produce a carbonic acid solution is one of the methods to understand this phenomenon. This carbonic acid solution is then reacted with carbonate rocks to precipitate bicarbonates. The rate of reaction depends upon the temperature, flow rate and particle size. In the present study, the accelerated weathering of limestone was carried out using different sizes of limestone cuttings (4 mm, 500, 250, 100 and 50 mu m) under different flow rates of carbonic acid (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 L/min) for a duration of 2 h at a constant temperature of 80 degrees C. SEM and elemental analysis were done before and after the experiment. Results from the experiment showed that the highest flow rate (1.5 L/min) exhibits the greatest weight loss. This weight loss is brought about by the dissolution of calcium to release bicarbonate and carbonate ions. EDXanalysis shows a reduction in both calcite and dolomite indicating dissolution of these two minerals. Acid attack on the samples forms dissolution patterns which are visible in SEM images. The principle mode of sequestration in limestone formation is ionic trapping. CO2 trapped in this way in the form of bicarbonate solution can be safely discharged in a water body or reservoir for storage.

TI  - Techno-economic and environmental feasibility of mineral carbonation technology for carbon neutrality: A Perspective
AB  - Although various CO2 capture and utilization (CCU) technologies are being researched and developed intensively for the purpose of lowering greenhouse gas emissions, most current technologies remain at low technology readiness levels for industrial use and are less economical compared to conventional processes. Mineral carbonation is a CO2 utilization technology with low net CO2 emissions and high CO2 reduction potential, and various commercialization studies are underway around the world. This manuscript reviews the potential of mineral carbonation as a general CCU technology and the techno-economic and environmental feasibility of a representative technology, which produces sodium bicarbonate through the saline water electrolysis and carbonation steps, and examines the potential CO2 reduction derived from the application of this technology. The future implementation of mineral carbonation technology in ocean alkalinity enhancement for sequestrating atmospheric CO2 or the production of abandoned mine backfill materials is also discussed in order to deploy the technology at much larger scales for a meaningful contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Bearing failure mechanism of rock-socketed monopile foundation for offshore wind turbine in weathered-granite seabed
AB  - Large-scale constructions of offshore wind power are carried out in southeast coast of China, where the seabed is covered in weathered granite. However, the bearing capacity and failure mechanism of monopile foundation in weathered-granite seabed are rarely researched. In this paper, the stress-strain characteristics and strength parameters of granite with different weathering degrees were obtained through laboratory tests, and the pre-strain test method was used to study mechanical parameter variation of moderately weathered granite in the crushing process. Experiment found that the strength parameters decrease mainly after the strain reaching 50% of the ultimate strain of moderately weathered granite. In addition, the bearing capacity and failure mode of rock-socketed monopile under unidirectional horizontal loading was investigated numerically. Analysis showed that the failure mode of rock-socketed monopile under unidirectional horizontal loading is progressive and presents two obvious failure zones. More critical, the existence of vertical loading effectively improves the horizontal bearing capacity of monopile foundation in the weathered rock seabed, and the failure envelope of the monopile foundation in H-V loading space is elliptic-shaped. This provides further understanding of the mechanical properties of submarine weathered granite, and the helpful reference for stability evaluation of rock-socketed monopile foundation in weathered granite seabed.

TI  - ASP system design for an offshore application in La Salina Field, Lake Maracaibo
AB  - La Salina Field, on the eastern coast of Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela, was designated as a Laboratorio Integrado de Campo (Integrated Field Laboratory, or IFL) by PDVSA to evaluate the potential application of different EOR processes. One of the main goals at La Salina IFL was to evaluate the alkaline-surfactant-polymer (ASP) technology potential in an oil reservoir near the end of its waterflood life. La Salina produces a medium-gravity crude oil (25Â°API) from the LL-03/Phase III Miocene reservoir at 915 m (3,000 ft). The feasibility of applying the ASP technology was based on a series of experiments including fluid compatibility, chemical thermal stability, phase behavior, interfacial tension between crude oil and ASP solution, chemical retention by the porous media, and physical simulation with reservoir core samples. The laboratory design involved 23 commercial surfactants, five polymers, and two alkalis. Interfacial tension reductions in excess of 25,000-fold were observed for a variety of ASP solutions. Type II- and Type III phase behaviors were observed. Linear coreflood results indicate that high-molecular-weight, partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide polymers can be injected into La Salina sand. Radial sandpack floods produced an average oil recovery of 45.6% original oil in place (OOIP) with water injection. Injection of 30% pore volume of ASP solution, followed by 30% pore volume of polymer drive solution, produced (on average) an additional 24.6% OOIP for an average total oil recovery of 70.2% OOIP. The design of the injection plant for La Salina is a challenging task because this will be the first offshore application of the ASP technology in the world. The initial decision for the plant design was to use an existing platform instead of a barge for the construction of facilities. As a result, critical parameters such as treatment sequence, equipment footprint, and storage space for injected and treatment chemicals were considered. Preparation and transport of a phase-stable ASP solution through the injection lines and into the reservoir are crucial. Designed chemical concentrations and physical characteristics must be maintained.

TI  - Geological and geotechnical characterisation for offshore wind turbine foundations: A case study of the Sheringham Shoal wind farm
AB  - This paper characterises the soil conditions at the Sheringham Shoal wind farm in the North Sea, in the context of designing foundations for offshore wind turbines. The purpose is to provide a realistic reference case study for research and practice in the emerging field of offshore wind energy. The soil data was obtained between 2005 and 2008 in an investigation program involving field measurements and laboratory experiments. The characterisation focuses on soil properties which are relevant for evaluating the performance of foundations for offshore wind turbines. The soil profile at the Sheringham Shoal site consists of four main units: two clay strata interbedded with a sand layer and underlain by a chalk bed. The heavily overconsolidated state of the clays and the densely compacted state of the sand dictate the behaviour of these soils. The chalk bed is characterised by varying degrees of weathering leading to significant variation in properties ranging from those typical for stiff soil to soft rock. These four main units, though differ considerably in soil composition, share several common characteristics including high shear strength and high stiffness but their shear stiffnesses reduce significantly both at high mobilised static shear strength and at medium to high mobilised strength under cyclic loading. The soil stiffness is an important input parameter for the design of offshore wind turbine foundations and hence the degradation of stiffness is an important issue at this wind farm. A number of soil properties at the site show considerable variability which requires a specific foundation design tailored for each location in order to be both safe and cost-effective.

TI  - Insitu chlorine generation for controlling biofouling of offshore structures
AB  - Marine biofouling occurs where certain sedentary organisms ranging from simple plants to animals attach themselves to underwater structures and affect their operation and maintenance to varying degrees. Cathodic protection is used to control the corosion but at the same time it may also enhance the fouling load on structures. The creation of interfacial alkalinity by cathodic protection favours the attachment of organisms. Removal of fouling by normal cleaning methods is costly and time consuming. Commercially available systems for controlling biofouling are copper based. In that process, copper is dissolved and the toxic copper ions generated are utilized for controlling biofouling. Insitu chlorine generation using electrochemical process is an emerging and promising technique to control biofouling. Under a collaborative research programme sponsored by the Institute of Engineering and Ocean Technology, ONGC, Panvel, CECRI had evaluated the efficiency of insitu chlorine generation for controlling biofouling of marine structures by carrying out model studies at Offshore Platform and Marine Electrochemistry Centre(OPMEC), Tuticorin. The data generated through the study are presented and discussed.

TI  - Renewable Energy and Energy Reductions or Solar Geoengineering for Climate Change Mitigation?
AB  - This review explores the question: should the world rely wholly or partially on solar geoengineering (SG) to mitigate climate change (CC), or on renewable energy, together with deep energy reductions? Recent thinking is for SG to only supplement more conventional climate change mitigation methods. However, we first show that conventional mitigation methods are not working., given that global annual CO2 emissions are still rising, so it is far more likely that SG will be called upon to counter most anthropogenic CC, as early research proposed. The paper next examines the various SG proposals that have been considered and their objectives. Future choices could be between an increasingly unpredictable climate, and SG, with its own risks and unknowns, or deep energy reductions and RE. The claim is that SG has far lower costs for a given climate forcing reduction compared with more conventional methods, and equally important, could be quickly implemented, producing temperature reductions in a year or so, compared with decades needed for more conventional mitigation approaches. SG implementation would affect not only the technical potential for key RE sources but also the actual uptake of RE and energy reductions. However, a fair comparison of RE and SG must recognise that the SG option also requires a solution to rising ocean acidification (OA). Because the material quantities needed annually to counter OA are orders of magnitude larger than for SG, its costs and energetic requirements will also be far higher, as will the time for implementation.

TI  - Self-Powered Seawater Electrolysis Based on a Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Hydrogen Production
AB  - Water splitting for yielding high-purity hydrogen represents the ultimate choice to reduce carbon dioxide emission owing to the superior energy density and zero-pollution emission after combustion. However, the high electricity consumption and requirement of large quantities of pure water impede its large-scale application. Here, a triboelectric nanogenerator (W-TENG) converting offshore wind energy into electricity is proposed for commercial electric energy saving and cost reduction. By introducing PTFE/POM dielectric pairs with matched HOMO/LUMO band gap energy, a high charge density is achieved to promote the output of W-TENG. With the impedance matching design of transformers with the internal resistance of W-TENG, the output current is further enhanced from 1.42 mA to 54.5 mA with a conversion efficiency of more than 92.0\%. Furthermore, benefiting from the high electrocatalytic activity (overpotential = 166 mV and Tafel slope = 181.2 mV dec(-1)) of a carbon paper supported NiCoPMOF catalyst, natural seawater can be adopted as a resource for in situ hydrogen production without acid or alkaline additives. Therefore, the self-powered seawater electrolysis system achieves a H-2 production rate as high as 1273.9 mu L min(-1) m(-2) with a conversion efficiency of 78.9\%, demonstrating a more practical strategy for conversion of wind energy into renewable hydrogen energy.

TI  - Experimental and numerical studies on working parameter selections of a piezoelectric-painted-based ocean energy harvester attached to fish aggregating devices
AB  - Fish aggregating devices (FADs) have not only greatly improved the fishing capacity in recent years, but also play an important role in marine monitoring and data collection. In this study, a flexible piezoelectric device (FPED) for ocean energy harvesting was designed to achieve continuous and stable energy supply for FAD equipments and islands. Firstly, we developed FPEDs coated with piezoelectric paint. Painted FPEDs were then attached to the frame of an FAD to examine their characteristics including submerged depth and the support-type. Moreover, under broadband wave conditions, we investigated the dominant parameters influencing electrical performance. Furthermore, we built a theoretical model according to the experiment setup and developed a computational model based on the immersed boundary method to evaluate the FPED-wave interactions. Both the theoretical and computational results were validated by experimental ones, demonstrating that the two models can be considered as alternative tools in FPED working parameter selections. Finally, we conducted a field test under real sea conditions with a remote data monitoring system for the painted FPEDs, which showed good performance under extreme bending, weathering, and fatigue.

TI  - Response of a Coastal Microbial Community to Olivine Addition in the Muping Marine Ranch, Yantai
AB  - Spreading olivine powder in seawater to enhance alkalinity through weathering reactions has been proposed as a potential solution to control atmospheric CO2 concentration. Attention has usually been paid to the chemical properties of seawater after the addition of olivine within lab and modeling studies. However, both microbial acclimation and evolution in such manipulated natural environments are often overlooked, yet they are of great importance for understanding the biological consequences of whether olivine addition is a feasible approach to mitigating climate change. In this study, an olivine addition experiment was conducted to investigate variation in bacterial diversity and community composition in the surface and bottom seawater of a representative marine ranch area in the Muping, Yantai. The results show that the composition of the particle-attached microbial community was particularly affected by the application of olivine. The relative abundance of biofilm-forming microbes in particle-attached fraction increased after the addition of olivine, while no significant variation in the free-living bacterial community was observed. Our study suggests that olivine addition would reshape the bacterial community structure, especially in particle-attached microenvironments. Therefore, the risk evaluation of alkalinity enhancement should be further studied before its large-scale application as a potential ocean geoengineering plan.

TI  - Laboratory experiments for the assessment of the physical and chemical impact of potential CO2 seepage on seawater and freshwater environments
AB  - This study focuses on a laboratory experimental injection of CO2 through calcareous and siliceous sediments both in freshwater and seawater aimed to identify the physical and chemical effects of CO2 seepage and to assess the ability of the system to return towards the original conditions once the CO2 injection is stopped. A rapid acidification of the water column during the CO2 injection and reduction in the dissolved oxygen concentration was measured as well as enhanced weathering of the sediments. A partial recovery towards the initial values of pH has been recorded following the stop of the CO2 injection. Â© 2014 The Authors Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Marine CO2 system variability in a high arctic tidewater-glacier fjord system, Tempelfjorden, Svalbard
AB  - The marine CO2 system in Tempelfjorden (Svalbard)was investigated between August 2015 and December 2017 using total alkalinity, pH, temperature, salinity, oxygen isotopic ratio, and nutrient data. Primary production resulted in the largest changes that were observed in the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2, 140 Î¼atm)and the saturation state of aragonite (Î©Ar, 0.9). Over the period of peak freshwater discharge (June to August), the freshwater addition and air-sea CO2 uptake (on average 15.5 mmol mâˆ’2 dayâˆ’1 in 2017)governed the surface pCO2. About one fourth of the uptake was driven by the freshening. The sensitivity of Î©Ar to the freshwater addition was investigated using robust regressions. If the effect of air-sea CO2 exchange was removed from Î©Ar, a freshwater fraction larger than 50% (lower range of uncertainty)was needed to provide aragonite undersaturated waters. This study shows that Î©Ar and freshwater fraction relationships that are derived from regression techniques and the interpretation thereof are sensitive to the effect of air-sea CO2 exchange. Since the freshening in itself only drives a fraction of the air-sea CO2 uptake, studies that do not account for this exchange will overestimate the impact of freshwater on Î©Ar. Finally, in the summer an excess in the salinity normalized dissolved inorganic carbon, corrected for aerobic primary production/respiration, of on average 86 Î¼mol kgâˆ’1 was found in the deepest water of the fjord. This excess is suggested to be a result of enhanced CO2 uptake and brine release during the period of sea ice growth. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Synergistically enhanced activity and stability of bifunctional nickel phosphide/sulfide heterointerface electrodes for direct alkaline seawater electrolysis
AB  - Direct electrolysis of seawater to generate hydrogen is an attractive but challenging renewable energy storage technology. Reasonable design of seawater electrolysis catalysts should integrate high activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)/ oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and enhanced physical/electro-chemical stability in seawater. Herein, we demonstrate the development of a Ni foam (NF) supported interfacial heterogeneous nickel phosphide/sulfide (Ni2P/NiS2) microsphere electrocatalyst (NiPS/NF) through a facile electrodeposition and subsequent phosphorization/sulfuration process. After NiS2 mod-ification, a charge redistribution on the heterointerface is demonstrated and a more advantageous cova-lent nature of the Ni-P bond is obtained for more easily adsorption of H{*} and H2O. The NiPS/NF thus yields an impressive electrocatalytic performance in 1.0 M KOH, requiring small overpotentials of 169 and 320 mV for HER and OER to obtain a high current density of 100 mA cm-2, respectively. The NiPS/NF can also work efficiently in alkaline seawater with negligible activity degradation, requiring overpoten-tials of only 188 and 344 mV for a current density of 100 mA cm-2 for HER and OER, respectively. A syn-ergistically enhanced physical/electrochemical long-term stability NiPS/NF in saline water is also demonstrated.

TI  - Predicting near-term variability in ocean carbon uptake
AB  - Interannual variations in air-sea fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) impact the global carbon cycle and climate system, and previous studies suggest that these variations may be predictable in the near term (from a year to a decade in advance). Here, we quantify and understand the sources of near-term predictability and predictive skill in air-sea CO2 flux on global and regional scales by analyzing output from a novel set of retrospective decadal forecasts of an Earth system model. These forecasts exhibit the potential to predict year-to-year variations in the globally integrated air-sea CO2 flux several years in advance, as indicated by the high correlation of the forecasts with a model reconstruction of past CO2 flux evolution. This potential predictability exceeds that obtained solely from foreknowledge of variations in external forcing or a simple persistence forecast, with the longest-lasting forecast enhancement in the subantarctic Southern Ocean and the northern North Atlantic. Potential predictability in CO2 flux variations is largely driven by predictability in the surface ocean partial pressure of CO2, which itself is a function of predictability in surface ocean dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity. The potential predictability, however, is not realized as predictive skill, as indicated by the moderate to low correlation of the forecasts with an observationally based CO2 flux product. Nevertheless, our results suggest that year-to-year variations in ocean carbon uptake have the potential to be predicted well in advance and establish a precedent for forecasting air-sea CO2 flux in the near future.

TI  - A novel concept of high Cu, low Mn, environmentally-friendly weathering steels
AB  - A novel concept of hot shortness control on copper containing weathering steels is proposed. The weathering effect of copper addition in steels and its improvement in the mechanical and impact properties by age hardening are well known. Again, it is also very well know the problem of cracks on hot processing of those steels, caused by liquid copper segregation, the "hot shortness". Hot shortness is the main problem of commercial producing of copper containing steels because of the increase of cost production caused by cracks the Ni addition to prevent them. Recent research found that copper segregates surrounding MnS inclusions in the steel, worsening the copper segregation caused by the preferential oxidation of iron on the hot processing of copper containing steels, which is the traditional cause of the "hot shortness". The same results also show that copper additionally precipitates as CuS in the bulk of the steel. This work points that the "hot shortness" can then be prevented by reducing the Mn in the steel, rather than by the expensive Ni addition. Reducing Mn means reduction of inclusions of MnS sites for copper segregation in the steel. Residual sulphur can therefore be trapped by the copper as finer CuS precipitates, so copper is then dissolved in the bulk of the steel rather than segregated. This paper introduces an alternative solution for the problem of the "hot shortness" by partially or fully replacing the Mn by Cu in those steels. It is then proposed a novel concept of low Mn, or Mn free, Cu containing weathering steels in which Cu replaces Mn in trapping the S. That new steel opens the possibility to a cheaper and easier controls of the "hot shortness" so the copper contamination from scraps become a technological benefit because of its age hardening and weathering effect on steels. The recycling of highly copper contaminated scraps is another important environmental advantage. The conclusion of this work is that the current results introduces a new technology of cheaper copper containing low Mn, or Mn free, high strength, environmentally-friendly weathering steels with high potential market for different welded on shore and offshore specifications.

TI  - Assessing the potential of calcium-based artificial ocean alkalinization to mitigate rising atmospheric CO2 and ocean acidification
AB  - Enhancement of ocean alkalinity using calcium compounds, e.g., lime has been proposed to mitigate further increase of atmospheric CO2 and ocean acidification due to anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Using a global model, we show that such alkalinization has the potential to preserve pH and the saturation state of carbonate minerals at close to today's values. Effects of alkalinization persist after termination: Atmospheric CO2 and pH do not return to unmitigated levels. Only scenarios in which large amounts of alkalinity (i.e., in a ratio of 2:1 with respect to emitted CO 2) are added over large ocean areas can boost oceanic CO2 uptake sufficiently to avoid further ocean acidification on the global scale, thereby elevating some key biogeochemical parameters, e.g., pH significantly above preindustrial levels. Smaller-scale alkalinization could counteract ocean acidification on a subregional or even local scale, e.g., in upwelling systems. The decrease of atmospheric CO2 would then be a small side effect.

TI  - A new CO2 disposal process using artficial rock weathering
AB  - To help decrease global warming a novel process for the disposal of anthropogenic CO2 involving artificially accelerated rock weathering is proposed. Since the rate of direct reaction between rock and CO2 is very slow, acetic acid is used as an accelerating medium for the reaction. The process involves two stages - (1) extraction of Ca ion by acetic acid from a Ca containing rock, and (2) Ca ion reaction with injected CO2 leading to CaCO3 crystallization from the solution. Since the Gibbs free energy for each step is negative, the reactions will spontaneously proceed without consuming large amount of energy. The reaction kinetics of each step have been studied experimentally to examine the feasibility of the proposed process. Based on the experimental results, a CO2 disposal process was designed and evaluated from the economic and energy consumption aspects. The results suggest that the process is competitive with other CO2 disposal scenarios such as ocean disposal.

TI  - Surface Modification of Fly Ash Concrete Through Nanophase Incorporation for Enhanced Chemical Deterioration Resistance
AB  - The global warming gas, CO2, is liberated when clay and limestone are crumbled for the production of cement. About 8â€“10% of the universal CO2 emissions are emitting from the cement factories. With concerns arising over environmental issues associated with cement usage, it is the need of the hour to reduce its consumption. Fly ash, the waste material from thermal power plants, is a widely used supplementary cementitious material that extends the life of the concrete structures. The intervening of nanotechnology into construction industry has provided wider opportunities to better the performance of concrete in rigorous conditions, especially acids and alkali environment. This work endeavours to study the effect of surface-modified fly ash concrete through the addition of nanoparticles against sulphate attack and calcium leaching. Nanophase modification was performed by integrating nano-TiO2 and CaCO3 for enhanced durability and corrosion resistance. Four types of concrete mix, namely fly ash concrete (FA), FA with 2% TiO2 nanoparticles (FAT), FA with 2% CaCO3 nanoparticles and FA with 2% TiO2:CaCO3 (FATC) nanoparticles, were designed and casted as cylindrical concrete blocks. The specimens were immersed in 1% sulphuric acid solution and sea water to study the resistance of concrete against sulphate attack and calcium leaching, respectively. Results showed that nanophase modification of fly ash concrete improved the resistance to sulphuric acid attack and calcium leaching. Among the nanophase-modified specimens, FAT and FATC specimens showed superior performance. Â© 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Review of Offshore Chemical Flooding Field Applications and Lessons Learned
AB  - This paper presents an overview of both research advancements and field applications of offshore chemical flooding technologies. Along with offshore oilfield development strategies that require maximization of oil production in a short development cycle, chemical flooding can become a potential avenue to accelerate oil production in secondary oil recovery mode. This makes it different from onshore chemical flooding processes that mostly focus on enhanced oil recovery in matured or maturing reservoirs. The advancements of offshore chemical flooding field applications are reviewed and analyzed. By summarizing offshore application cases, it also assesses the chemical formulations applied or studied and injection/production facilities required in the offshore environments. Main technical challenges are presented for scaling up the applications on offshore platforms or floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) systems. The technologies reviewed include polymer flooding, surfactant-polymer flooding, and alkaline-surfactant-polymer flooding. By assessing the technology readiness level of these technologies, this study presents their perspectives and practical relevance for offshore chemical flooding applications. It has been long realized that chemical flooding, especially polymer flooding, can improve oil recovery in offshore oil fields. The applications in Bohai Bay (China), Dalia (Angola), and Captain (North Sea) provide the know-how workflows for offshore polymer flooding from laboratory to full field applications. It is feasible to implement offshore polymer injection either on platform or FPSO system. It is recommended to implement polymer flooding at early stage of reservoir development in order to maximize the investment of offshore facilities. By tuning the chemistry of polymer products, they can present very good compatibility with seawaters. Therefore, choosing a proper polymer is no longer a big issue in offshore polymer flooding. There are also some interesting research findings reported on the development of novel surfactant chemistries for offshore applications. The outcome from a number of small-scale trials including the single well tracer tests on surfactant, alkaline-surfactant, surfactant-polymer in offshore Malaysia, Abu Dhabi, Qatar, and South China Sea provided valuable insights for the feasibility of chemical flooding in offshore environments. However, the technology readiness levels of surfactant-based chemical flooding processes are still low partially due to their complex interactions with subsurface fluids and lack of much interest in producing residual oil from matured offshore reservoirs. Based on the lessons learned from offshore applications, it can be concluded that several major challenges still need to be overcome in terms of large well spacing, reservoir voidage, produced fluid treatment, and high operational expense to successfully scale up surfactant based chemical flooding processes for offshore applications.

TI  - Engineering Multilevel Collaborative Catalytic Interfaces with Multifunctional Iron Sites Enabling High-Performance Real Seawater Splitting
AB  - Given the abundant reserves of seawater and the scarcity of freshwater, real seawater electrolysis is a more economically appealing technology for hydrogen production relative to orthodox freshwater electrolysis. However, this technology is greatly precluded by the undesirable chlorine oxidation reaction and severe chloride corrosion at the anode, further restricting the catalytic efficiency of overall seawater splitting. Herein, a feasible strategy by engineering multifunctional collaborative catalytic interfaces is reported to develop porous metal nitride/phosphide heterostructure arrays anchoring on conductive Ni2P surfaces with affluent iron sites. Collaborative catalytic interfaces among iron phosphide, bimetallic nitride, and porous Ni2P supports play a positive role in improving water adsorption/dissociation and hydrogen adsorption behaviors of active Fe sites evidenced by theoretical calculations for hydrogen evolution reactions, and enhancing oxygenated species adsorption and nitrate-rich passivating layers resistant to chloride corrosion for oxygen evolution reaction, thus cooperatively propelling high-performance bifunctional seawater splitting. The resultant material Fe2P/Ni1.5Co1.5N/Ni2P performs excellently as a self-standing bifunctional catalyst for alkaline seawater splitting. It requires extremely low cell voltages of 1.624 and 1.742 V to afford current densities of 100 and 500 mA/cm2 in 1 M KOH seawater electrolytes, respectively, along with superior long-term stability, outperforming nearly all the ever-reported non-noble bifunctional electrocatalysts and benchmark Pt/IrO2 coupled electrodes for freshwater/seawater electrolysis. This work presents an effective strategy for greatly enhancing the catalytic efficiency of non-noble catalysts toward green hydrogen production from seawater electrolysis.

TI  - Biochar addition affected the dynamics of ammonia oxidizers and nitrification in microcosms of a coastal alkaline soil
AB  - Biochar amendments have frequently been reported to alter microbial communities and biogeochemical processes in soils. However, the impact of biochar application on bacterial (AOB) and archaeal ammonia oxidizers (AOA) remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the responses of AOB and AOA to the application of biochar derived from cotton stalk at rates of 5, 10, and 20 \% by weight to a coastal alkaline soil during a 12-week incubation. The results showed that the amoA gene of AOB consistently outnumbered that of AOA, whereas only the AOA amoA gene copy number was significantly correlated with the potential ammonia oxidation (PAO) rate (P < 0.01). The significant decrease of PAO rates in biochar treatments occurred after incubation for 4-6 weeks, which were distinctly longer than that in the control (2 weeks). The PAO rates were significantly different among treatments during the first 4 weeks of incubation (P < 0.05), with the highest usually in the 10 \% treatment. Biochar application significantly increased the abundance of both nitrifiers in the 4 weeks of incubation (P < 0.05). Biochar amendment also decreased AOA diversity, but increased AOB diversity, which resulted in different community structures of both nitrifiers (P < 0.01), as shown by the differences between the 5 \% biochar and the control treatments. We conclude that biochar application generally enhanced the abundance and altered the composition of ammonia oxidizers; the rate of biochar application also affected the rate and dynamics of nitrification, and the risk for increasing the alkalinity and N leaching of the studied soil was lower with a lower application rate.

TI  - Little evidence that lowering the pH of concrete supports greater biodiversity on tropical and temperate seawalls
AB  - Concrete is one of the most commonly used materials in the construction of coastal and marine infrastructure despite the well known environmental impacts which include a high carbon footprint and high alkalinity (similar to pH 13). There is an ongoing discussion regarding the potential positive effects of lowered concrete pH on benthic biodiversity, but this has not been investigated rigorously. Here, we designed a manipulative field experiment to test whether carbonated (lowered pH) concrete substrates support greater species richness and abundance, and/or alter community composition, in both temperate and tropical intertidal habitats. We constructed 192 experimental concrete tiles, half of which were carbonated to a lower surface pH of 7-8 (vs. control pH of > 9), and affixed them to seawalls in the United Kingdom and Singapore. There were 2 sites per country, and 6 replicate tiles of each treatment were collected at 4 time points over a year. Overall, we found no significant effect of lowered pH on the abundance, richness, or community assemblage in both countries. Separate site- and month-specific generalised linear models (GLMs) showed only sporadic effects: i.e. lowered pH tiles had a small positive effect on early benthic colonisation in the tropics but this was later succeeded by similar species assemblages regardless of treatment. Thus, while it is worth considering the modification of concrete from an environmental/emissions standpoint, lowered pH may not be a suitable technique for enhancing biodiversity in the marine built environment.

TI  - Carbon budget of coral reef systems: an overview of observations in fringing reefs, barrier reefs and atolls in the Indo-Pacific regions
AB  - The seawater CO2 system and carbon budget were examined in coral reefs of wide variety with respect to topographic types and oceanographic settings in the Indo-Pacific oceans. A system-level net organic-to-inorganic carbon production ratio (R-OI) is a master parameter for controlling the carbon cycle in coral reef systems, including their sink/source behavior for atmospheric CO2. A reef system with R-OI less than approximately 0.6 has a potential for releasing CO2. The production ratio, however, is not easy to estimate on a particular reef. Instead, observations planned to detect the offshore-lagoon difference in partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and a graphic approach based on a total alkalinity-dissolved inorganic carbon diagram can reveal system-level performance of the carbon cycle in coral reefs. Surface pCO(2) values in the lagoons of atolls and barrier reefs were consistently higher than those in their offshore waters, showing differences between 6 and 46 muatm, together with a depletion in total alkalinity up to 100 mumol kg(-1), indicating predominant carbonate production relative to net organic carbon production. Reef topography, especially residence time of lagoon water, has a secondary effect on the magnitude of the offshore-lagoon pCO(2) difference. Terrestrial influence was recognized in costal reefs, including the GBR lagoon and a fringing reef of the Ryukyu Islands. High carbon input appears to enhance CO2 efflux to the atmosphere because of their high dissolved C:P ratios. Coral reefs, in general, act as an alkalinity sink and a potentially CO2-releasing site due to carbonate precipitation and land-derived carbon.

TI  - Enhanced oil recovery: Potential for oil production development in Fang oilfield, Thailand
AB  - Fang oilfield is a small onshore reservoir in Thailand containing oil with gravity ranging from 20-40 Â°API and viscosity of approximately 10-120 cp. The depth of this field is from 300-1,200 meters and the sand thickness is varied from of 1 to 7 meters. For over 60 years of natural production, the field has low oil recovery. The difficulty has been attributed to the unfavorable production. Waterflooding, a secondary recovery, has been studied and the results show that the recovery can increase 4-6%. However, the production can be enhanced more with the tertiary recovery methods or enhanced oil recovery (EOR) which are recommended to increase oil production in this challenging field. However, the proper technologies have not been studied for commercial production yet. These technologies can be thermal recovery, gas injection, microbial enhanced oil recovery and chemical methods. Therefore, it will be the objective of this work to review and screen the EOR method to fit well with oil production in Fang oilfield in order to increase oil production. From this EOR screening, the main results from this study reveal that chemical injection is more appropriate for this field than other techniques because of reservoir characteristics and reservoir fluids. Based on the types of oil and composition in the oil, adding alkaline solution and surfactant can improve oil recovery because they can reduce interfacial tension of oil and to make the mobility higher. On the other hand, for other techniques, thermal recovery can increase mobility because of wax formation but it has higher cost. CO2 injection can increase more oil production. Nevertheless, the sources of CO2 has less supply and is expensive. Now, microbial enhanced oil recovery is on the beginning state and can provide the good potential. Consequently, based on the revision and screening method, the chemical method provide the higher commercial potential and feasibility to enhance oil production in Fang oilfield and the result of this study can be applied to design the plan of oil production operation in the oilfield in the future.

TI  - Impact of faults on the mechanical and petrophysical properties of sandstone reservoirs - An implication for CO2 storage
AB  - To assess reliable candidate reservoirs/aquifers for CO2 storage, enhanced understanding of the structure and the mechanical and petrophysical properties of strain localization zones in comparison to the surrounding undeformed rock is essential (Torabi 2007). To understand the possible effect of deformation structures on CO2 storage, a fieldwork was performed in the Navajo and Entrada sandstones in southeastern Utah to investigate the elastic and petrophysical properties of a fault core and damage zone. Deformation structures, air permeability and rock hardness have been logged along scan-lines perpendicular to the fault. In the foot-wall fractures are observed just within distance of three meters from the fault, but deformation bands are spread to about hundreds of meters. In the hangingwall fractures are observed in a distance of more than seventy meters, while deformation band have been concentrated within forty meters from the fault. Our preliminary results show a strong correlation between deformation structures intensity and distance from the fault, but weak correlation between Schmidt Hammer rebound and mini-perm values versus deformation pattern. The spread in the measured data might be related to variation in internal layering in the sand dunes, the orientation and weathering of the surface used for testing or other structural effects.

TI  - Atmospheric CO2 sink: Silicate weathering or carbonate weathering?
AB  - It is widely accepted that chemical weathering of Ca-silicate rocks could potentially control long-term climate change by providing feedback interaction with atmospheric CO2 drawdown by means of precipitation of carbonate, and that in contrast weathering of carbonate rocks has not an equivalent impact because all of the CO2 consumed in the weathering process is returned to the atmosphere by the comparatively rapid precipitation of carbonates in the oceans. Here, it is shown that the rapid kinetics of carbonate dissolution and the importance of small amounts of carbonate minerals in controlling the dissolved inorganic C (DIC) of silicate watersheds, coupled with aquatic photosynthetic uptake of the weathering-related DIC and burial of some of the resulting organic C, suggest that the atmospheric CO2 sink from carbonate weathering may previously have been underestimated by a factor of about 3, amounting to 0.477Pg C/a. This indicates that the contribution of silicate weathering to the atmospheric CO2 sink may be only 6%, while the other 94% is by carbonate weathering. Therefore, the atmospheric CO2 sink by carbonate weathering might be significant in controlling both the short-term and long-term climate changes. This questions the traditional point of view that only chemical weathering of Ca-silicate rocks potentially controls long-term climate change. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - What role has upwelling played in the global carbon and climate cycles on a million-year time scale?
AB  - Upwelling zones are important sites for the removal of carbon from the ocean-atmosphere reservoir. Characterized by high biological production rates and high organic carbon-to-carbonate rain ratios, they substantially contribute to the transport of organic carbon to the deep sea and its burial in sediments. Although the organic carbon export from surface waters seems to be most effective in upwelling regions, these zones probably did not act as sinks for atmospheric CO2 at time scales up to 10,000 years. The remineralization of organic carbon in deeperwaters and the warming of upwelled CO2-rich waters result in an increase of surface water PCO2, which may override the biologically mediated PCO2 drawdown. On the other hand, at a time scale of millions of years, upwelling zones might have contributed significantly to variations in ocean-atmospheric CO2 concentrations and to climate change, because organic carbon burial in marine sediments is held to be a major carbon sink along with continental weathering, both driving the long-term trend in atmospheric pCO(2) decrease and climate cooling during the middle and late Cenozoic (Lasaga et al. 1985; Vincent and Berger 1985). Proxy records reflecting changes in organic carbon burial, continental weathering, atmospheric pCO(2), and climate change reveal a specific temporal pattern for the last 20 million years. This pattern supports the idea that phases of increased continental weathering and organic carbon burial in marine sediments led to substantial ocean-atmosphere CO2, reduction and have triggered phases of more rapid temperature decrease superimposed on the overall Cenozoic climate cooling. However, no such patterns are evident in the early Cenozoic, indicating that other processes besides organic carbon burial and continental weathering (e.g., volcanic CO2) were important for the global carbon cycle and climate evolution on a million-year time scale. More detailed proxy records of the geochemical processes affecting the global carbon cycle, and thus climate, as well as better reliability of these proxies, are needed for future evaluation of mechanisms associated with open ocean and coastal upwelling and their relevance for global cycles.

TI  - Seasonal variability of net sea-air CO2 fluxes in a coastal region of the northern Antarctic Peninsula
AB  - We show an annual overview of the sea-air CO2 exchanges and primary drivers in the Gerlache Strait, a hotspot for climate change that is ecologically important in the northern Antarctic Peninsula. In autumn and winter, episodic upwelling events increase the remineralized carbon in the sea surface, leading the region to act as a moderate or strong CO2 source to the atmosphere of up to 40 mmol m(-2) day(-1). During summer and late spring, photosynthesis decreases the CO2 partial pressure in the surface seawater, enhancing ocean CO2 uptake, which reaches values higher than -40 mmol m(-2) day(-1). Thus, autumn/winter CO2 outgassing is nearly balanced by an only 4-month period of intense ocean CO2 ingassing during summer/spring. Hence, the estimated annual net sea-air CO2 flux from 2002 to 2017 was 1.24 +/- 4.33 mmol m(-2) day(-1), opposing the common CO2 sink behaviour observed in other coastal regions around Antarctica. The main drivers of changes in the surface CO2 system in this region were total dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity, revealing dominant influences of both physical and biological processes. These findings demonstrate the importance of Antarctica coastal zones as summer carbon sinks and emphasize the need to better understand local/regional seasonal sensitivity to the net CO2 flux effect on the Southern Ocean carbon cycle, especially considering the impacts caused by climate change.

TI  - Forestry Ecological Engineering in Coastal Saline-Alkali Soils
AB  - There are about 27 million ha of saline-alkali land in China, including 0.06 million ha of cultivated land and 0.21 million ha of saline-alkali wasteland, mainly distributed in the northeast, north China, northwest inland areas and the coastal areas north of the Yangtze River. Affected by many factors, the area of secondary salinized soil at home and abroad is still expanding. The main ways to prevent salinization are to reduce the groundwater level, improve soil physicochemical properties, and reduce evaporation. According to this principle, selecting suitable tree species and plants and carrying out ecological restoration through vegetation construction is an effective way to improve the use of saline-alkali land. The principle of ecological restoration is to fully understand the formation mechanism, hazard characteristics, and distribution pattern of saline-alkali land, to construct and restore vegetation according to the principle of restoration ecology, and to reduce soil salinity and improve soil by plant adsorption of salt ions, so that the soil structure and farmland ecological environment are enhanced and help to achieve sustainable and efficient use of saline-alkali land. The main technical measures for the ecological restoration of saline-alkali land include water conservancy engineering improvement, biological improvement, agricultural improvement, chemical improvement, and so on. The improvement of water conservancy projects needs to establish and improve the irrigation and drainage engineering system, formulate measures to improve salinization state, and adopt reasonable irrigation techniques; biological improvement is to plant trees in saline-alkaline soil, plant green manure grass and salt-tolerant crops, and reduce surface water evaporation so as to improve physical and chemical properties of the soil; agricultural improvement is to optimize land use, appropriate deep tillage, increase to apply organic fertilizer and perform grass grain rotation, and so on, to reduce soil salinity and prevent soil salinization; chemical improvement mainly uses chemical amendments to improve saline-alkali land and reduce soil alkali content and increase land production potential.

TI  - Interface shear characteristics of Scottish rock samples from sites with tidal energy potential
AB  - Tidal energy generators are usually deployed in high velocity near-shore channels, and consequently the foundations may have to be placed on exposed rock seabeds, as surface sediments may have been eroded. In this paper, key engineering characteristics of some rock types found at locations with high energy potential around Scotland are presented, along with practical issues for foundation deployment that have been identified during field visits. Geomorphological features found at beach locations and wave cut platforms, along with the effect of weathering on rock strength, are presented and discussed. Laboratory characterisation and results from rock-steel interface testing utilizing the direct shear box apparatus suggest that relative surface roughness has the potential to significantly affect foundation-rock horizontal capacity.

TI  - Ammonia as alkali for alkaline/surfactant/polymer floods
AB  - Ammonia is logistically preferred over sodium carbonate for alkaline/surfactant/polymer (ASP) enhanced-oil-recovery projects because of its low molar mass and the possibility for it to be delivered as a liquid. On an offshore platform, space and weight savings can be the determining factor in deciding whether an ASP project is feasible. Logistics may also be critical in determining the economic feasibility of projects in remote locations. Ammonia as alkali together with a surfactant blend of alkyl propoxy sulfate/internal olefin sulfonate (APS/IOS) functions as an effective alkali. Surfactant adsorption is low, and oil recovery in corefloods is high. Static adsorption tests show that low surfactant adsorption is attained at pH >9, a condition that ammonia satisfies at low solution concentration. It is expected that ammonia has a performance deficiency relative to sodium carbonate in that it does not precipitate calcium from solution. Calcium accumulation in the ammonia ASP solution will occur, caused by ion exchange from clays. The high oil recovery for ammonia and the calcium accumulation in ASP and surfactant/polymer corefloods with APS/IOS blends show that this surfactant system is effective and calcium-tolerant. Also, phase behavior and interfacial-tension (IFT) measurements suggest that APS/IOS blends remain effective in the presence of calcium. Ethylene oxide/propylene oxide sulfates (such as the used APS) are known commercially available, calcium-tolerant surfactants. However, because of hydrolysis, sulfate-type surfactants are suitable for use only in lower-temperature reservoirs. Very different behavior was noticed for phase-behavior measurements with calcium-intolerant surfactants such as alkyl benzene sulfonates and IOS. In this case, calcium addition results in a very high IFT and complete separation of oil and brine. Presumably, this will result in low oil recovery. A preferred approach for ASP offshore with divalent-ion-intolerant surfactants may be the use of a hybrid alkali system combining the attributes of sodium carbonate and ammonia. The concept is to supply the bulk of the alkalinity for an ASP flood by ammonia with all the inherent logistical advantages. A minor quantity of sodium carbonate is added to the formulation to specifically precipitate calcium ions. Copyright Â© 2016 Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - The suitability of alkali activated slag as a substrate for sessile epibenthos in Reef Cubes (R)
AB  - Reef Cubes (R) are novel artificial reef units intended to enhance habitat complexity and provide hard substrate around marine man-made infrastructure. If made with Portland Cement, Reef Cubes (R) could create numerous negative environmental impacts, including a high carbon footprint. Alkali-activated materials (AAMs) are a collection of alternative binders associated with lower embodied emissions but alterations to concrete chemistry can affect the development of marine fouling communities. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of replacing Portland Cement with an AAM binder on the development of macrofouling communities on Reef Cubes (R). 25 cm sided Reef Cubes (R) were manufactured using three different concrete material types and deployed in the subtidal zone of Torbay, Devon, UK. The material types were an alkali activated slag concrete (Type: AAM), a cement-limestone blend (CEM-II) concrete (Type: C) and a cement-limestone blend (CEM-II) concrete with an additional micro silica pozzolan and an exposed aggregate texture (Type: CP). After 1 year of immersion the Reef Cubes (R) were retrieved, and fouling communities were analysed visually or scraped and weighed to gauge biomass. Univariate metrics of species richness, species diversity, total live cover, total biomass, calcareous mass and live biomass; and multivariate community compositions were compared. There were no significant differences in species richness, species diversity, total biomass, calcareous mass and live biomass between the material types. Total live cover was significantly different; with C appearing the highest, followed by AAM and CP, however pairwise comparisons were not significant. The community compositions on the AAM and C Reef Cubes (R) were not significantly different. Both were significantly different to the CP material type, which had a higher abundance of erect Bryozoans. The results suggest that compared to cement-based concretes, AAMs are a satisfactory substrate for the development of epibenthic communities on Reef Cubes (R). There was also evidence contrary to common artificial reef practice that exposing the aggregate and incorporating a pozzolan improves biodiversity.

TI  - Current status and development trend of anti-corrosion technology for steel structures in coastal power plants
AB  - Traditional zinc-rich coatings and hot-dip galvanizing technologies cannot meet the anti-corrosion requirements of steel structures in coastal power plants, so for new anti-corrosion technologies low energy consumption, no pollution and low cost become a trend. The corrosion status of steel structures in power plants in coastal areas of China is reviewed. The current status and existing problems of several anti-corrosion technologies, including coating, hot-dip galvanizing, thermal spraying, weathering steel, cathodic protection and composite materials are introduced. Based on the development situation, graphene heavy-duty anti-corrosion coating, thermal spraying and new composite materials will gradually become the trend instead of traditional anti-corrosion technologies.

TI  - Increasing Costs Due to Ocean Acidification Drives Phytoplankton to Be More Heavily Calcified: Optimal Growth Strategy of Coccolithophores
AB  - Ocean acidification is potentially one of the greatest threats to marine ecosystems and global carbon cycling. Amongst calcifying organisms, coccolithophores have received special attention because their calcite precipitation plays a significant role in alkalinity flux to the deep ocean (i.e., inorganic carbon pump). Currently, empirical effort is devoted to evaluating the plastic responses to acidification, but evolutionary considerations are missing from this approach. We thus constructed an optimality model to evaluate the evolutionary response of coccolithophorid life history, assuming that their exoskeleton (coccolith) serves to reduce the instantaneous mortality rates. Our model predicted that natural selection favors constructing more heavily calcified exoskeleton in response to increased acidification-driven costs. This counter-intuitive response occurs because the fitness benefit of choosing a better-defended, slower growth strategy in more acidic conditions, outweighs that of accelerating the cell cycle, as this occurs by producing less calcified exoskeleton. Contrary to the widely held belief, the evolutionarily optimized population can precipitate larger amounts of CaCO3 during the bloom in more acidified seawater, depending on parameter values. These findings suggest that ocean acidification may enhance the calcification rates of marine organisms as an adaptive response, possibly accompanied by higher carbon fixation ability. Our theory also provides a compelling explanation for the multispecific fossil time-series record from similar to 200 years ago to present, in which mean coccolith size has increased along with rising atmospheric CO2 concentration.

TI  - North Sabah EOR ADP - Examining the challenges of offshore ASP Development
AB  - Three producing fields, located offshore Sabah in northern Borneo are currently being jointly considered Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). An initial screening study conducted in 2009/2010, indicated that a successful implementation of Alkali Surfactant Polymer (ASP) flooding might result in significant improvement in the ultimate recovery from the field. Due to a limited experience with ASP flooding in offshore environment, a joint Shell and PETRONAS Carigali team was tasked to explore the entire solution space for this opportunity. This led to a development of 4 anchor cases, which span the expected key development decisions of injection strategy, injection rates, composition of the chemical cocktail, type of the host structure and location (onshore/ offshore). The intent was to develop an understanding the trade offs between the project decisions with an ultimate objective to defining a series of building blocks and staircase to demonstrate technical feasibility and economical viability. The anchor cases are organized around the injection rate as the injection rate was assumed to be the key cost driver for the topside facilities at the outset of the study. In the course of development and analysis of four anchor cases, a number of technical challenges emerged related to the choice of the water treatment scheme, power generation strategy and mechanical handling of chemicals in powder form. The technical challenges identified will require innovative solutions in the technology domain to enable a viable solution to the ASP flooding in the offshore environment.

TI  - Emergency carbon management: Geoengineering
AB  - Geoengineering is a set of radical contingency actions to deliberately modify the Earthâ€™s energy balance in order to counteract the adverse impact of human activities on the global ecosystem and climate. The Greenhouse Gas Management (GGM) is one of the main geoengineering strategies aiming at reducing the atmospheric CO2 levels within a reasonable time frame by enhancing an uptake and storage of carbon through a variety of biological (e.g., ocean fertilization) and chemical (e.g., enhanced weathering) engineered systems. Today, geoengineering remains a highly controversial issue; among major concerns are possible unintended planetary-scale adverse ecological impacts of the projects, and the disputable benefits of the geoengineering approach compared to other carbon mitigation strategies. Geoengineering poses acute and novel challenges that would require international cooperation, transparency, and the proactive and effective managing of research. The current status of major GGM geoengineering projects, their technical feasibility and economics, the challenges and risks associated with their global deployment are analyzed in this chapter.

TI  - Biochar amendment ameliorates soil properties and promotes Miscanthus growth in a coastal saline-alkali soil
AB  - Biochar amendment has been proposed to be as a promising means to improve soil properties and enhance plant productivity in different types of soils. However, biochar application in the improvement of plant productivity in saline-alkali soils has received less attention. In the present study, we carried out a pot experiment in greenhouse to evaluate the effect of biochar amendment on the growth of Miscanthus lutarioriparius, a promising bioenergy crop, in a coastal saline-alkali soil during a 92-day growth period. The biochar was added at 0, 1.0\%, 2.0\%, 2.5\%, 5.0\%, and 10.0\% (w/w) levels in a random block design with three replicates. The results showed that biochar applications at 2.0\% and 2.5\% levels significantly promoted Miscanthus growth by ameliorating the physicochemical and biological properties of the saline-alkali soil. The soil moisture, soil organic matter (SOM), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), available phosphorus (Olsen-P), and concentrations of potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions were significantly increased, while soil pH, bulk density, ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), sodium (Na+) ion, and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) contents were substantially reduced. In addition, the soil bacterial community structure and diversity were substantially shifted after the biochar amendment, which in turn affected soil N and P cycling and improved soil physicochemical properties. Meanwhile, biochar application considerably mitigated the salinity stress to Miscanthus plants by activating anti-oxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT), therefore enhancing the scavenging capability of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Together, our results indicated that biochar amendment effectively promoted Miscanthus growth by ameliorating soil physical, chemical and biological properties, and alleviated salt stress injuries to plants in a coastal saline-alkali soil.

TI  - Amelioration effects of coastal saline-alkali soil by ball-milled red phosphorus-loaded biochar
AB  - There is a great demand for amelioration of coastal saline-alkali soil, which requires efficient and economical amendments. Biochar has been proven to be a promising soil amendment and newly modified biochar is competitive for amelioration of coastal saline-alkali soil. Herein, a novel biochar (BPBC) was successfully prepared by ball milling and red phosphorus (P) loading. Ball milling could effectively grind pristine biochar into submicron particles, load uniform and nanoscale P-containing particles on biochar, and hence markedly improve the special surface area, P loading amount, and P-containing functional groups contents. Meanwhile, the oxidative conversion of red P into phosphorus oxides and phosphate was promoted, which could be ascribed to reactions with the minerals and O-containing functional groups of biochar. These reactions also occurred in the amended soil, thus significantly decreasing the soil electrical conductivity and salinity by phosphate precipitation between BPBC and soluble salt ions, and decreasing the soil pH and alkalinity by acid-base neutralization. BPBC improved the soil quality and fertility by enhancing organic carbon content, cation exchange capacity, soil nutrients (e.g., N, P, K), and soil enzyme activities. Moreover, amendment of biochar, especially BPBC, could improve the microbial community structure and promote the germination and growth of maize. Overall, BPBC is a novel, efficient, and eco-friendly soil amendment that is able to ameliorate soil salinity and alkalinity, improve soil quality, and promote plant productivity in coastal saline-alkali soil.

TI  - Hydrologic Context Alters Greenhouse Gas Feedbacks of Coastal Wetland Salinization
AB  - Changes in sea-level rise and precipitation are altering patterns of coastal wetland hydrology and salinization. We conducted paired laboratory (20Â weeks) and field (15Â weeks) marine salt addition experiments to disentangle the effects of hydrology (permanent versus intermittent flooding) and elevated marine salts (sulfate versus other salt ions) on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from freshwater forested wetland soils. Marine salt additions strongly affected GHG emissions in both experiments, but the magnitude, and even the direction, of GHG responses depended on the hydrologic context in which marine salt exposure occurred. Under permanent flooding, carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were unaffected by marine salts, whereas methane (CH4) fluxes were significantly suppressed by the addition of sulfate (as K2SO4) both with and without marine salts. In contrast, in intermittently flooded field and laboratory soils elevated salinity reduced carbon mineralization and CO2 fluxes, but enhanced CH4 fluxes relative to both controls and treatments with elevated sulfate. Thus, elevated salinity or alkalinity (and not sulfate) controlled both gaseous carbon fluxes under intermittent flooding. Nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes had contrasting responses in the field and laboratory. In the laboratory, N2O fluxes were not significantly related to chemical treatment but increased with porewater ammonium concentrations, which increased in salinity treatments via cation exchange. In intermittently flooded field conditions, elevated salinity strongly suppressed N2O fluxes because ammonium did not accumulate in porewater; it was likely lost through advection, dispersion, or plant uptake. Understanding dynamic hydrologic and vegetation patterns across wetland landscapes will be critical for predicting both the magnitude and direction of wetland GHG responses to increasing marine salt across broad spatial scales.

TI  - Late Pleistocene Carbon Cycle Revisited by Considering Solid Earth Processes
AB  - The importance of volcanic CO2 release, continental weathering, and coral reef growth on the global carbon cycle has been highlighted by several different studies. Based on these independent approaches, we here revisit the last 800 kyr with the box model BICYCLE, which has been extended to be able to address these solid Earth contributions to the carbon cycle. We show that the volcanic outgassing of CO2 as a function of sea level change from mid-ocean ridges and hot spot island volcanoes cannot be the generic process that leads during phases of falling obliquity to a sea level-CO2 decoupling as has been suggested before. The combined contribution from continental and marine volcanism, if both lagging sea level change by 4 kyr, might have added up to 13 ppm to the glacial/interglacial CO2 rise. Coral reef growth as suggested by an independent model is during glacial terminations about an order of magnitude too high to be reconciled with meaningful carbon cycle dynamics. Global riverine input of bicarbonate caused by silicate and carbonate weathering is suggested to have been stable over Termination I. However, if weathering fluxes are changed by up to 50\% in sensitivity experiments, the corresponding bicarbonate input might contribute less than 20 ppm to the deglacial atmospheric CO2 rise. The overall agreement of results with the new process-based sediment module and the previously applied time-delayed response function to mimic carbonate compensation gives confidence in the results obtained in previous applications of the BICYCLE model without solid Earth processes.

TI  - Carbon Nanotube Reinforced High Density Polyethylene Materials for Offshore Sheathing Applications
AB  - Multiwall carbon nanotube (CNT)-filled high density polyethylene (HDPE) nanocomposites were prepared by extrusion and considered for their suitability in the offshore sheathing applications. Transmission electron microscopy was conducted to analyse dispersion after bulk extrusion. Monolithic and nanocomposite samples were subjected to accelerated weathering and photodegradation (carbonyl and vinyl indices) characterisations, which consisted of heat, moisture (seawater) and UV light, intended to imitate the offshore conditions. The effects of accelerated weathering on mechanical properties (tensile strength and elastic modulus) of the nanocomposites were analysed. CNT addition in HDPE produced environmentally resilient nanocomposites with improved mechanical properties. The energy utilised to extrude nanocomposites was also less than the energy used to extrude monolithic HDPE samples. The results support the mass substitution of CNT-filled HDPE nanocomposites in high-end offshore applications.

TI  - A new approach for offshore chemical enhanced oil recovery
AB  - Chemical Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) has seen numerous applications worldwide onshore but very few offshore. The reasons for that are mostly related to the technical and logistical challenges that need to be overcome for the successful implementation of chemical EOR: Transporting various chemicals to the platforms, the need for space for the mixing skids and storing chemicals on the platforms, the need to use sea water as the injection fluid among others. As primary and secondary recovery reach their technical and economical limits in offshore fields, the operators are faced with the dilemma of abandoning the field and the platforms or resorting to EOR to increase recovery and extend the life of the field. Non chemical EOR techniques face their own challenges such as the need for large gas supply for gas injection so chemical methods cannot be ruled out so easily. However new approaches need to be defined to make chemical EOR a realistic method for offshore reservoirs. A large part of these issues arise from the mindset which associates chemical EOR with Alkali-Surfactant-Polymer injection. The approach proposed is to use only surfactant in cases where polymer is not absolutely required and to eliminate alkali altogether. This will eliminate various obstacles such as deck space limitations and the need to soften the injection water. This approach opens new doors for chemical Enhanced Recovery offshore. Such an approach is possible thanks to the progress in surfactant formulation and the development of adsorption inhibitors which allow dealing with seawater as an injection fluid. The novelty is not the technology but the way the standard approach is discarded to the benefit of a simpler solution.,. Copyright Â© (2015) by the Offshore Technology Conference All rights reserved.

TI  - Rotting windmills?
AB  - The techniques to protect the wind turbines of off-shore wind farms from the corrosion problems are discussed. A new technology to protect the offshore is the use of inorganic hybrid materials (Polysiloxanes) as super durable finishes. With polysiloxane systems, it is possible to develop a lot quicker hardness and cure, which does not get affected either mechanically or weathering wise during the entire process. These coatings, however, are based on new chemistry and have required extensive laboratory work to understand the implications of the competing crosslinking reactions. The areas where new coatings are being continuously improved is their ability to resist cracking on the inevitable over thick areas, which often occur on poorly prepared areas such as welds. The advantages of using siloxanes coatings are that these can be repaired more easily and are more resilient to weathering because the excess thickness of multiple coats can suffer shrinkage over time.

TI  - Environmental evaluation of dredged sediment submitted to a solidification stabilization process using hydraulic binders
AB  - Purpose: Dredging of sediments, a requirement for harbor maintenance, removes millions of tons of mineral wastes, contaminated at varying degrees with trace metals, from the water. In previous investigations, Cu and Zn have been identified as highly concentrated trace metals associated to sulfides, mineral phases sensitive to oxidation. In order to ensure their sustainable management, the solidification/stabilization (S/S) and/or the valorization of contaminated sediments as secondary raw materials is a way to be promoted. Indeed, their reuse as a substitute of sand in cemented mortar formulation would allow combining both treatment and valorization of such wastes. Methods: In the present study, the environmental assessment of mortars formulated with raw and weathered marine sediments (in particular contaminated with Cu, Pb and Zn), compared to sand reference mortars, was conducted through two kinetic leaching tests: weathering cell tests (WCTs), in which mortars were crushed and leached twice a week, and a tank monolith leaching test (MLT), in which leaching was performed on monolithic mortars with increasing leachate renewal time. Results: In both leaching tests, calcium and sulfur were released continuously from sediment mortars, showing the oxidation-neutralization processes of sulfides and carbonates. In the MLT, Cu was released by sediment mortars through diffusion, particularly by weathered mortars, at low concentrations during 60 days of the test duration. With the more aggressive WCT, Cu concentrations were higher at the beginning but became negligible after 7 days of testing. Pb was released through diffusion mechanisms until depletion in both tests, whereas Zn was particularly well immobilized in the cemented matrices. Conclusions: The S/S process applied using hydraulic binders proved to be efficient in the stabilization of Cu, Pb, and Zn highly presents in studied sediments, and further valorization in civilian engineering applications could be considered.

TI  - Ammonia as alkali for ASP floods - Comparison to sodium carbonate
AB  - Ammonia is logistically preferred over sodium carbonate for alkaline-surfactant-polymer enhanced oil recovery projects (ASP) due to its low molar mass and the possibility for it to be delivered as a liquid. On an offshore platform space and weight savings can be the determining factor in deciding whether an ASP project is feasible. Logistics may also be critical in determining the economic feasibility of projects in remote locations. Ammonia functions as an effective alkali together with a surfactant blend of alkyl propoxy sulfate- internal olefin sulfonate (APS/IOS).

Static adsorption tests show that low surfactant adsorption is attained at pH > 9, a condition that ammonia satisfies at low solution concentration. It is expected that ammonia has a performance deficiency relative to sodium carbonate in that it does not precipitate calcium from solution. Calcium accumulation in the ammonia ASP solution will occur due to ion exchange from clays. The high oil recovery for ammonia and the calcium accumulation in ASP and SP core floods with APS-IOS blends shows that this surfactant system is effective and calcium-tolerant. Also, phase behavior and IFT measurements suggest that APS/IOS blends remain effective in the presence of calcium. EO/PO sulfates (such as the employed APS) are well known commercially available, calcium-tolerant surfactants. However, due to hydrolysis sulfate-type surfactants such as APS are suitable for use only in lower temperature reservoirs. Very different behavior was noticed for phase behavior measurements with calcium intolerant surfactants such as alkyl benzene sulfonates (ABS) and internal olefin sulfonates (IOS). In this case calcium addition results in a very high IFT and complete separation of oil and brine. Presumably this will result in low oil recovery.

TI  - An introduction to the oilspill risk analysis model
AB  - The U.S. Geological Survey has developed an ollspill risk analysis model to aid in estimating the environmental hazards of developing oil resources in Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) lease areas. This large, detailed, computerized model analyzes the probability of spill occurrence, likely paths of the spills, and locations of recreational and biological resources which may be vulnerable. The analysis implicitly includes estimates of weathering rates, slick dispersion, and possible mitigating effects of cleanup. The probability of spill occurrence is estimated from information pertaining to the volume of oil expected to be produced and the anticipated method and distance of transport. Spill movement is modeled in a Monte Carlo fashion with a sample of 500 spills per season, each transported by monthly currents and winds sampled from wind transition matrices. These matrices, based upon historic wind records and encompassing 41 wind velocity states, are constructed for each season for up to six wind stations. Locations and monthly vulnerabilities of up to 31 categories of environmental resources are digitized within an 800,000 km2 area. Coastlines can be divided into lOOsegmehts to further define those areas likely to be impacted. Output of the model includes tables of conditional probabilities of impact (i.e., the probability of hitting a target, given that a spill has occurred), as well as the probability distributions for oilspills occurring and contacting environmental resources within 3, 10, 30, and 60 days. The model provides the Department of the Interior with a method for realistically assessing oilspill risks associated with OCS development. So far, it has been used for analyzing oilspill risks for eight OCS lease sales, and the results have been incorporated into several environmental impact statements. A "real time" version was also used to forecast the movement of the Argo Merchant oilspill. Additional model runs are planned for future OCS lease sales in frontier areas. Other possible applications include analysis of OCS development alternatives and site selection for oilspill cleanup equipment. Copyright Â©1979. Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Ocean warming, more than acidification, reduces shell strength in a commercial shellfish species during food limitation
AB  - Ocean surface pH levels are predicted to fall by 0.3-0.4 pH units by the end of the century and are likely to coincide with an increase in sea surface temperature of 2-4Â°C. The combined effect of ocean acidification and warming on the functional properties of bivalve shells is largely unknown and of growing concern as the shell provides protection from mechanical and environmental challenges. We examined the effects of near-future pH (ambient pH -0.4 pH units) and warming (ambient temperature +4Â°C) on the shells of the commercially important bivalve, Mytilus edulis when fed for a limited period (4-6 h day-1). After six months exposure, warming, but not acidification, significantly reduced shell strength determined as reductions in the maximum load endured by the shells. However, acidification resulted in a reduction in shell flex before failure. Reductions in shell strength with warming could not be explained by alterations in morphology, or shell composition but were accompanied by reductions in shell surface area, and by a fall in whole-body condition index. It appears that warming has an indirect effect on shell strength by re-allocating energy from shell formation to support temperature-related increases in maintenance costs, especially as food supply was limited and the mussels were probably relying on internal energy reserves. The maintenance of shell strength despite seawater acidification suggests that biomineralisation processes are unaffected by the associated changes in CaCO3 saturation levels. We conclude that under near-future climate change conditions, ocean warming will pose a greater risk to shell integrity in M. edulis than ocean acidification when food availability is limited.

TI  - Reconciling atmospheric CO2, weathering, and calcite compensation depth across the Cenozoic
AB  - The Cenozoic era (66 to 0 million years) is marked by long-term aberrations in carbon cycling and large climatic shifts, some of which challenge the current understanding of carbon cycle dynamics. Here, we investigate possible mechanisms responsible for the observed long-term trends by using a novel approach that features a full-fledged ocean carbonate chemistry model. Using a compilation of pCO2, pH, and calcite compensation depth (CCD) observational evidence and a suite of simulations, we reconcile long-term Cenozoic climate and CCD trends. We show that the CCD response was decoupled from changes in silicate and carbonate weathering rates, challenging the continental uplift hypothesis. The two dominant mechanisms for decoupling are shelf-basin carbonate burial fractionation combined with proliferation of pelagic calcifiers. The temperature effect on remineralization rates of marine organic matter also plays a critical role in controlling the carbon cycle dynamics, especially during the warmer periods of the Cenozoic.
