TI  - Kaolin-nucleation-based biotreated calcareous sand through unsaturated percolation method
AB  - Ocean development is an effective and practical way to address resource issues, such as food, fuel, and land shortage. The current work proposed using kaolin-based biocement to stabilize calcareous sand which is always the main component of the foundations of ocean engineering. Five kinds of kaolin concentrations (0Â g/L, 10Â g/L, 20Â g/L, 50Â g/L, and 100Â g/L) were selected to stabilize calcareous sand via the unsaturated percolation method. Besides, the saturated strength was determined to mimic the practical situations. The results showed that treatment cycles and raw materials can be reduced to obtain a given saturated strength when moderate kaolin is added. That is, the cost-performance of the MICP is improved. Besides, the maximum attainable saturated strength can be enlarged when a small dosage of kaolin is added. The distribution of precipitate contents along with the height of the specimens was also determined by the buoyancy method. Furthermore, a critical permeability range, i.e., 1.11 âˆ¼ 2.70 Ã— 10 - 4 m/s, is also distinguished from the permeability tests. The percolation method is not suitable for sand with a permeability smaller than this range. Â© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Monopile-mounted wave energy converter for a hybrid wind-wave system
AB  - Multipurpose platforms are innovative solutions to combine the sustainable exploitation of multiple marine resources. Among them, hybrid wind-wave systems stand out due to the multiple synergies between these two forms of marine renewable energy. The objective of this work is to develop a hybrid system for monopile substructures, which are currently the prevailing type of substructure for offshore wind turbines, and more specifically to focus on the wave energy converter sub-system, which consists in an oscillating water column. For this purpose, an in-depth experimental campaign was carried out using a 1:40 scale model of the wave energy converter sub-system and the monopile substructure, considering regular and irregular waves. Based on the experimental results the performance of the device and its interaction with the wave field were characterised â€“ a fundamental step to fully understand the benefits and limitations of this hybrid wind-wave system, which sets the basis for its future development. Regarding the performance, the best efficiency was obtained with the turbine damping corresponding to a 0.5% orifice size, and two resonance peaks were identified (T = 9 and 6 s). As for the interaction of the hybrid system with the wave field, between 5% and 66% of the incident wave power is reflected and between 3% and 45%, transmitted. The wave period was found to be the parameter that most influenced wave run-up on the substructure. This characterisation of the behaviour of the hybrid system shows that it is indeed a promising option for further development. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Effects of seawater scrubbing on a microplanktonic community during a summer-bloom in the Baltic Sea
AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has gradually applied stricter regulations on the maximum sulphur content permitted in marine fuels and from January 1, 2020, the global fuel sulphur limit was reduced from 3.5\% to 0.5\%. An attractive option for shipowners is to install exhaust gas cleaning systems, also known as scrubbers, and continue to use high sulphur fuel oil. In the scrubber, the exhausts are led through a fine spray of water, in which sulphur oxides are easily dissolved. The process results in large volumes of acidic discharge water, but while regulations are focused on sulphur oxides removal and acidification, other pollutants e.g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, metals and nitrogen oxides can be transferred from the exhausts to the washwater and discharged to the marine environment. The aim of the current study was to investigate how different treatments of scrubber discharge water (1, 3 and 10\%) affect a natural Baltic Sea summer micro planktonic community. To resolve potential contribution of acidification from the total effect of the scrubber discharge water, ``pH controls{'' were included where the pH of natural sea water was reduced to match the scrubber treatments. Biological effects (e.g. microplankton species composition, biovolume and primary productivity) and chemical parameters (e.g. pH and alkalinity) were monitored and analysed during 14 days of exposure. Significant effects were observed in the 3\% scrubber treatment, with more than 20\% increase in total biovolume of microplankton compared to the control group, and an even greater effect in the 10\% scrubber treatment. Group-specific impacts were recorded where diatoms, flagellates incertae sedis, chlorophytes and ciliates increased in biovolume with increasing concentrations of scrubber water while no effect was recorded for cyanobacteria. In contrast, these effects was not observed in the ``pH controls{''}, a suggestion that other parameters/stressors in the scrubber water were responsible for the observed effects.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration a Viable Option to Mitigate Climate Change
AB  - Anthropogenic activity mainly burning of fossil fuels like coal, gas and oil is one of the major reasons which increase concentration of earth-warming gases. Chief among these gases is carbon dioxide. As per the data in last 250 years, CO2 level increases from 250 to more than 280 parts per million (PPM). Major consequences of this rise in CO2 level involve disturbance in climatic factors such as sea level rise; floods; droughts; changes in the amount, timing and distribution of rain; increased frequency and intensity of wildfires and disturbance of coastal marine and other ecosystems. That is why control over CO2 production and reducing CO2 level become important. One of the natural ways to CO2 control involves CO2 sequestration which involves removal of CO2 from atmosphere or storage of CO2 from emission sources to vegetation, soil and sediments. Biological carbon sequestration has opened up a new area of research towards enhancing rapid fixation of atmospheric carbon dioxide in present level to reduce and mitigate global warming and climate change. This chapter describes various sources of carbon dioxide with relation to increasing greenhouse gases. It also includes scientific basis for current understanding of climate change and the role of biological carbon sequestration like soil, grassland, peatland and forests for mitigating the increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration.

TI  - Renewable energy homes for marine life: Habitat potential of a tidal energy project for benthic megafauna
AB  - An increasing number of offshore structures are being deployed worldwide to meet the growing demand for renewable energy. Besides energy production, these structures can also provide new artificial habitats to a diversity of fish and crustacean species. This study characterises how concrete mattresses that stabilise the submarine power cable of a tidal energy test site can increase habitat capacity for benthic megafauna. A five-year monitoring, which relied on both visual counts and video-based surveys by divers, revealed that these mattresses provide a suitable habitat for 5 taxa of large crustaceans and fish. In particular, two commercially valuable species, i.e. the edible crab Cancer pagurus and the European lobster Homarus gammarus, showed a constant occupancy of these artificial habitats throughout the course of the project. The shape and the number of shelters available below individual mattresses largely determine potential for colonisation by mobile megafauna. Local physical characteristics of the implantation site (e.g. substratum type, topography, exposition to current etc.) significantly impact amount and type of shelters provided by the concrete mattresses. Thus, to characterise habitat potential of artificial structures, it is not only essential to consider (i) the design of the structures, but also to (ii) account for their interactions with local environmental conditions when deployed on the seafloor.

TI  - Development of biomass energy in Taiwan: Current status and prospects
AB  - Taiwan is a small island located in the west pacific. Due to lack in natural resources, over 98.7\% of the energy required is imported. In order to combat the global warming effect, seek energy independence, and develop energy industry, Taiwan is currently devoted to renewable energy sources, including solar cells, wind power, and biomass energy. With the advantages in its photo-electronic industry, Taiwan is now the forth solar cell manufacturer in the world. The agricultural tradition of Taiwan also enabled it to breed high efficient energy plants suitable for biomass production. Biodiesel production will reach B2 (2\% biodiesel) goal in 2010, and the midterm goal for ethanol production is E10 (10\% ethanol). Using high carbon content energy plants and gasification techniques combined with fermentation, our system is able to compete with Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (demanding extreme conditions) and pure-fermentation methods (slow and low yield). In the future, we would also utilize the ocean around Taiwan for production of algae biomass, which is able to absorb large amount of CO2 and with variants suitable for different requirements (high oil content for biodiesel or high cellulose content for bio-ethanol).

TI  - Optimisation of biogas generation from brown seaweed residues: Compositional and geographical parameters affecting the viability of a biorefinery concept
AB  - Very recently, integrated biorefinery approaches are being developed with the aim to produce high-value products for a variety of industries in conjunction with green energy from sustainable biomass. Macroalgae (seaweed) have been regarded as more sustainable compared to terrestrial crops, since they do not occupy land for growth. Macroalgal biomass changes greatly according to species and harvest season, which affects its chemical energy potential. This study was conducted seasonally on five species of brown seaweed over a yearlong period to investigate the effects of chemical composition variations, bioproducts extraction processes and inoculum acclimatation on methane production. As a result of the bioproducts extraction, it was found the seaweed residues exhibit a great potential to produce methane. Stoichiometric methane yield and C:N ratio changed in favour of an improved digestibility with bioconversion rates greater than 70% in some instances, i.e. achieved by Laminaria species and on the West coast Fucus serratus. The two Laminaria species investigated also presented the highest CH4 production rate, with Laminaria digitata reaching 523 mL CH4 gVSâˆ’1 and L. saccharina peaking at 535 mL CH4 gVSâˆ’1 with acclimatised and non-acclimatised sludge respectively.

TI  - Sustainable deployment of naval ships through integrated waste abatement system
AB  - In this era of asymmetric warfare proliferation, networked global public scrutiny, paradigm shift in environmental consciousness, and yet, increased demand for naval force projection through expeditionary presence, unrestricted international deployability becomes a critical naval ship capability. One often neglected aspect of this requirement is the operational impact of solid and liquid waste abatement. This paper highlights the environmental challenges facing modern expeditionary navies and explores one innovative technology transfer potentially providing an integrated solid waste treatment system. The results from a demonstrator evaluation of the Micro Auto Gasification Systemâ„¢ (MAGSâ„¢) appliance onboard a Royal Canadian Navy vessel are shared to show the MAGS capability to efficiently convert mixed organic waste such as plastic, paper, cardboard, oily sludge and food into biochar and useful thermal energy while reducing CO2 emissions.

TI  - Mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion of lipid-extracted microalgae N. gaditana for methane production
AB  - In the last years, a huge effort has been made to make biodiesel production from microalgae a feasible option. Besides the potential of biodiesel for replacing fossil fuels as a cleaner alternative, some limitations have still to be overcome. Among them, the low energy yields of the process and the high-energy requirements of the harvesting and drying steps lead to a high cost per litre of fuel. In this context, anaerobic digestion of the microalgal biomass after lipid extraction can improve the energy balance of the process, by producing methane and revalorizing a waste generated during biodiesel production. In this study, the production of biogas by anaerobic digestion of the marine microalgae Nannochloropsis gaditana after oil extraction was studied. As the hydrolysis is known to be the rate-limiting step of anaerobic digestion of solid substrates, the influence of the process temperature on this step was assessed. For this purpose, two different anaerobic sludges, i.e. mesophilic (35 Â°C) and thermophilic (55 Â°C), were used as inocula for different batch tests and for two continuous anaerobic bioreactors. The influence of the oil extraction process on the structural integrity of the microalgae was also studied. The results obtained from scanning electron microscopy and flow cytometry showed that the lipid extraction did not cause cell lysis, but the structure of their surface was affected by the process. Batch assays showed that thermophilic conditions did not improve the biomethane potentials when compared to mesophilic conditions. Two continuous anaerobic bioreactors operated for 120 days confirmed the batch results. However, measurements of the chemical oxygen demand showed that the soluble fraction in the thermophilic reactor was higher than under mesophilic conditions, indicating an improved hydrolysis step. This was confirmed by the results of scanning electron microscopy and flow cytometry, which suggested a more intense disintegration of microalgae in the thermophilic reactor, indicating a greater degree of hydrolysis. Nevertheless, this advantage of thermophilic temperatures over mesophilic conditions did not improve the methane productivity. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Micro- and nanotechnologies in plankton research
AB  - A better understanding of the vast range of plankton and their interactions with the marine environment would allow prediction of their large-scale impact on the marine ecosystem, and provide in-depth knowledge on pollution and climate change. Numerous technologies, especially lab-on-a-chip microsystems, are being used to this end. Marine biofouling is a global issue with significant economic consequences. Ecofriendly polymer nanotechnologies are being developed to combat marine biofouling. Furthermore, nanomaterials hold great potential for bioremediation and biofuel production. Excellent reviews covering focused topics in plankton research exist, with only a handful discussing both micro- and nanotechnologies. This work reviews both micro- and nanotechnologies applied to broad-ranging plankton research topics including flow cytometry, chemotaxis/toxicity assays, biofilm formation, marine antifouling/fouling-release surfaces and coatings, green energy, green nanomaterials, microalgae immobilization, and bioremediation. It is anticipated that developments in plankton research will see engineered exploitation of micro- and nanotechnologies. The current review is therefore intended to promote micro-/nanotechnology researchers to team up with limnologists/oceanographers, and develop novel strategies for understanding and green exploitation of the complex marine ecosystem.

TI  - Total fuel-cycle emissions for marine vessels: A Well-to-Hull Analysis with Case Study
AB  - Regional and global air pollution emissions from marine transportation is a growing concern. In discerning the sources of such pollution, researchers have become interested in tracking where along the total fuel cycle these emissions occur. In addition, new efforts to introduce alternative fuels in marine vessels have raised new questions about the energy use and environmental impacts of such fuels. To address these issues, this paper presents the Total Energy & Emissions Analysis for Marine Systems (TEAMS) model. TEAMS can be used to analyze total fuel-cycle emissions and energy use from marine vessels. TEAMS captures â€œwell-to-hullâ€ emissionsâ€”that is, emissions along the entire fuel pathway, including extraction, processing, distribution, and use in vessels. TEAMS conducts analyses for six fuel pathways: (1) petroleum to residual oil; (2) petroleum to conventional diesel; (3) petroleum to low-sulfur diesel; (4) natural gas to compressed natural gas; (5) natural gas to Fischer-Tropsch diesel; and, (6) soybeans to biodiesel. TEAMS calculates total fuel-cycle emissions of three greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane) and five criteria pollutants (volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters of 10 micrometers or less, and sulfur oxides). TEAMS also calculates total energy consumption, fossil fuel consumption, and petroleum consumption associated with each of its six fuel cycles. TEAMS can be used to study emissions from a variety of user-defined vessels. This paper provides modeling results for a passenger ferry case study using alternative fuels.

TI  - Carbon sequestration in soil and biomass under native and non-native mangrove ecosystems
AB  - Aims Mangrove ecosystems can help mitigate climate change by sequestering significant amounts of carbon (C) from the atmosphere and ocean, contributing to regional ``blue carbon{''} stocks. However, it is unclear whether non-native species introduced in coastal wetlands can function as a more efficient carbon sink. Methods By examining two dominant mangrove species, native Kandelia obovata (KO) and exotic Sonneratia apetala Buch.-Ham. (SA), at the Qi'ao Island, China, we quantified and compared ecosystem C storage, C sequestration rate, source and stability of soil organic carbon (SOC) under different vegetation covers. Results \& conclusion Our results showed that both species acted as strong carbon sinks relative to mudflat reference, with overall ecosystem C storage being comparable under KO (410 Mg C ha(-1)) and SA with different stand ages (224-452 Mg C ha(-1)), but a few times higher than corresponding unvegetated mudflat. However, by excluding SOC accumulation from prior land use (i.e., unvegetated mudflat), non-native species (i.e., SA) showed a significantly higher ecosystem carbon sequestration rate (8.2-16.4 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) than native KO (4.5 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)), owing largely to fast biomass carbon sequestration in SA ecosystem. Relative to mudflat reference, the input of autochthonous source (mangrove tissues) contributed substantially to additional carbon sequestration under mangroves. It should be noted that the relative size of carbon sequestration in non-native mangroves is also affected by factors related to ecosystem, climate, soil properties and land use, the differences still exist among locations, and ecosystem modeling with field validation is desirable for regional estimation of carbon stocks and sequestration rates.

TI  - Geoengineering climate by stratospheric sulfur injections: Earth system vulnerability to technological failure
AB  - We use a coupled climate-carbon cycle model of intermediate complexity to investigate scenarios of stratospheric sulfur injections as a measure to compensate for CO2-induced global warming. The baseline scenario includes the burning of 5,000 GtC of fossil fuels. A full compensation of CO2-induced warming requires a load of about 13 MtS in the stratosphere at the peak of atmospheric CO2 concentration. Keeping global warming below 2Â°C reduces this load to 9 MtS. Compensation of CO 2 forcing by stratospheric aerosols leads to a global reduction in precipitation, warmer winters in the high northern latitudes and cooler summers over northern hemisphere landmasses. The average surface ocean pH decreases by 0.7, reducing the calcifying ability of marine organisms. Because of the millennial persistence of the fossil fuel CO2 in the atmosphere, high levels of stratospheric aerosol loading would have to continue for thousands of years until CO2 was removed from the atmosphere. A termination of stratospheric aerosol loading results in abrupt global warming of up to 5Â°C within several decades, a vulnerability of the Earth system to technological failure.

TI  - Extracellular carotenoid production and fatty acids profile of Parachlorella kessleri under increased CO2 concentrations
AB  - Large-scale cultivations of photoautotrophic microorganisms represent a very promising and potentially cost-effective alternative for climate change mitigation, when associated to the co-production of high value bioproducts, such as fatty acids and carotenoids, considering the growing demand for natural products. During microalgae cultivation, CO2 enrichment is a requirement to reach high productivities, although high CO2 levels are normally stressful to microalgae. On the other hand, cellular stress is a well reported strategy to induce carotenoid and fatty acids production. This work evaluated extracellular carotenoid production from the mangrove-isolated microalga Parachlorella kessleri cultivated under 5, 15 and 30% CO2 in stirred tank photobioreactors. In the 10th day of cultivation, CO2 supply was interrupted until the end of the cultivation (14th day), causing a stressful and imperative condition for microalgae cells to release the red pigment. Growth kinetics, physiological parameters and bioproducts production were evaluated. Growth kinetics were similar under all tested conditions and differences were not statistically significant, with the highest values of Î¼max, biomass concentration, lipid content and CO2 fixation rate of 0.77 dâˆ’1, 1.24 g Lâˆ’1, 241 mg gâˆ’1 (dw) and 165 mg Lâˆ’1 dâˆ’1, respectively. In contrast, total carotenoid concentrations varied significantly (p &lt; 0.01), with the highest concentration of 0.030 Î¼g mL-1 under 5% CO2. The produced red pigment presented antioxidant activity and characteristics of carotenoids confirmed by UVâ€“vis and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The fatty acid profiles in the biomass varied in response to CO2 levels in the cultivations. In general, higher CO2 concentrations (15 and 30%) favored the production of saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acids, suitable as biodiesel feedstock, while drastically decreased the production of the polyunsaturated.

TI  - A comparison of alternative fuels for shipping in terms of lifecycle energy and cost
AB  - Decarbonization of the shipping sector is inevitable and can be made by transitioning into lowâ€ or zeroâ€carbon marine fuels. This paper reviews 22 potential pathways, including conventional Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) marine fuel as a reference case, â€œblueâ€ alternative fuel produced from natural gas, and â€œgreenâ€ fuels produced from biomass and solar energy. Carbon capture technology (CCS) is installed for fossil fuels (HFO and liquefied natural gas (LNG)). The pathways are compared in terms of quantifiable parameters including (i) fuel mass, (ii) fuel volume, (iii) life cycle (Wellâ€Toâ€ Wakeâ€”WTW) energy intensity, (iv) WTW cost, (v) WTW greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, and (vi) nonâ€GHG emissions, estimated from the literature and ASPEN HYSYS modelling. From an energy perspective, renewable electricity with battery technology is the most efficient route, albeit still im-practical for longâ€distance shipping due to the low energy density of todayâ€™s batteries. The next best is fossil fuels with CCS (assuming 90% removal efficiency), which also happens to be the lowest cost solution, although the longâ€term storage and utilization of CO2 are still unresolved. Biofuels offer a good compromise in terms of cost, availability, and technology readiness level (TRL); however, the nonâ€GHG emissions are not eliminated. Hydrogen and ammonia are among the worst in terms of overall energy and cost needed and may also need NOx cleanâ€up measures. Methanol from LNG needs CCS for decarbonization, while methanol from biomass does not, and also seems to be a good candidate in terms of energy, financial cost, and TRL. The present analysis consistently compares the various options and is useful for stakeholders involved in shipping decarbonization. Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - An environmental impact assessment of exported wood pellets from Canada to Europe
AB  - There have been increased interests on exporting wood pellets from Canada to Europe to meet the increased demand on biofuels in European countries. The wood pellet industry in Canada, especially in the west coastal region, has grown at an annual rate of more than 20% averaged over last 5 years due to the steady supply of wood residues. This paper attempted to analyze the fuel consumption and air emissions associated with the wood pellet production in British Columbia and export to Sweden based on a streamlined life cycle analysis, starting from tree harvesting for wood residue production to the shipping of wood pellets from Vancouver to Stockholm in Sweden. The results showed that about 7.2 GJ of energy is consumed for each tonne of wood pellets produced and shipped to Europe, representing about 39% of the total energy content of the wood pellets. Among those energies consumed over the life cycle, about 2.6 GJ is associated with long-distance ocean transportation. The ocean transportation is also the major contributor to environmental and health impacts, followed by the pellet production processes. The fossil fuel content, which quantifies the amount of fossil fuel consumed over the life cycle, for exported wood pellets ranged from 19% to 35%, depending on whether natural gas or wood residue is used in the drying operation during the wood pellet production stage. To reduce the fossil fuel content and the environmental impacts, wood residues should be used in the drying operation and, if possible, local market should be explored to reduce the energy consumption associated with wood pellet transportation over long distances.

AB  - A novel modular floating structure combined artificialreef and wave energy converter (WEC) is proposed, so as to make comprehensive use of marine space, biological resources and renewable energy. Considering the multi-body coupling effect and mechanical coupling effect between the hexagonal floating structure and the floating artificial reef, the coupling time-domain analysis model of the integrated structure system is established based on potential theory. The design parameters of the floating artificial reef and the WEC are preliminary optimized. The dynamic response characteristics and the power output characteristics of the new integrated structure system under typical sea conditions are studied. It is revealed that the outside floating artificial reef can produce considerable energy while reducing the influence of wave load on the inside hexagonal floating structure. In addition, the safety of the integrated structure system under extreme sea conditions is further verified. Â© 2022, Solar Energy Periodical Office Co., Ltd. All right reserved.

TI  - Comparative life cycle assessment of heterotrophic microalgae Schizochytrium and fish oil in sustainable aquaculture feeds
AB  - Fish oil is primarily extracted from small marine pelagic fishes, reducing their availability for marine wildlife forage and artisanal fishing catches that support food security in lower income coastal nations. A primary use of fish oil is in feeds for aquaculture, the world's fastest growing food sector. Efforts to transition fed aquaculture to sustainability includes replacing fish oil in aquafeeds with more environmentally responsible alternative ingredients. The heterotrophic marine microalga Schizochytrium sp., one of the first commercialized alternatives, lacks an open-access, systematic analysis of environmental impacts of substituting fish oil with heterotrophic microalgae from biorefineries. This study compared the â€œcradle to factory-gateâ€ life cycle impacts of fish oil to whole-cell or extracted oil of Schizochytrium combined with canola oil. We conducted an attributional life cycle assessment using inventory data collected from published literature and patents and received feedback on commercial relevance of model assumptions from industry advisors. We examined sugar from a Brazilian sugarcane biorefinery and sucrose from U.S. sugar beets as feedstocks for heterotrophic cultivation of Schizochytrium; and compared life cycle impacts of extracting Schizochytrium oil using solvent-free microwave extraction to conventional solvent extraction. Results were that: cultivation processes had the largest overall effect for both products in both regions; whole-cell Schizochytrium combined with canola oil had significantly lower environmental impacts, in all assessed categories, than Schizochytrium oil blended with canola oil; and conventional solvent extraction had significantly lower environmental impacts compared to solvent-free microwave extraction except global warming potential. Schizochytrium products, compared to fish oil, had substantially lower biotic resource depletion and, in the case of whole cells combined with canola oil, had significantly lower global warming potential but higher impacts for all other categories, primarily because commercial Schizochytrium production used sugar feedstocks as carbon and energy sources. The mix of lower and higher environmental impacts of Schizochytrium products illustrates the importance of openly identifying environmental tradeoffs to inform evidence-based decisions for commercial practices. Environmental impacts should also be weighed against potential human health benefits of maintaining omega-3 fatty acids and avoiding contaminants in fish flesh when considering alternatives to fish oil.

TI  - Improving photosynthesis for algal biofuels: Toward a green revolution
AB  - Biofuels derived from marine algae are a potential source of sustainable energy that can contribute to future global demands. The realisation of this potential will require manipulation of the fundamental biology of algal physiology to increase the efficiency with which solar energy is ultimately converted into usable biomass. This 'photosynthetic solar energy conversion efficiency' sets an upper limit on the potential of algal-derived biofuels. In this review, we outline photosynthetic molecular targets that could be manipulated to increase the efficiency and yield of algal biofuel production. We also highlight modern 'omic' and high-throughput technologies that might enable identification, selection and improvement of algal cell lines on timescales relevant for achieving significant contributions to future energy solutions.

TI  - Building a bio-based industry in the Middle East through harnessing the potential of the Red Sea biodiversity
AB  - The incentive for developing microbial cell factories for production of fuels and chemicals comes from the ability of microbes to deliver these valuable compounds at a reduced cost and with a smaller environmental impact compared to the analogous chemical synthesis. Another crucial advantage of microbes is their great biological diversity, which offers a much larger â€œcatalogâ€ of molecules than the one obtainable by chemical synthesis. Adaptation to different environments is one of the important drives behind microbial diversity. We argue that the Red Sea, which is a rather unique marine niche, represents a remarkable source of biodiversity that can be geared towards economical and sustainable bioproduction processes in the local area and can be competitive in the international bio-based economy. Recent bioprospecting studies, conducted by the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, have established important leads on the Red Sea biological potential, with newly isolated strains of Bacilli and Cyanobacteria. We argue that these two groups of local organisms are currently most promising in terms of developing cell factories, due to their ability to operate in saline conditions, thus reducing the cost of desalination and sterilization. The ability of Cyanobacteria to perform photosynthesis can be fully exploited in this particular environment with one of the highest levels of irradiation on the planet. We highlight the importance of new experimental and in silico methodologies needed to overcome the hurdles of developing efficient cell factories from the Red Sea isolates. Â© 2017, The Author(s).

TI  - Two captains will not sink the ship: Evaluation of bio-based bunker fuel production and distribution logistics in brazil
AB  - Marine transport is the most cost-effective mode of international long-distance transportation. Hence, marine transportation is responsible for an expressive demand for fossil fuels that results in around 3% of global CO2 emissions. Nowadays, this industry face challenges to reduce the GHG and air pollutant emissions of their ships. Rules and regulatory parameters to drastically reduce emissions from marine transport activities have been set. Thus, the utilization of alternative biofuels in marine transportation has caught the attention of the sector. Therefore, this study aims to assess the Brazilian potential to produce marine biofuels (biobunkers). For this purpose, the applied methodology includes the characterization of biofuel production pathways, the assessment of costs-effectiveness of the readiest pathways according to the Brazilian conditions. Further, a life cycle analysis (LCA) and the evaluation of biofuel production and distribution logistics in Brazil were performed. Preliminary results reveal that production costs are still higher than conventional marine fuels. The biofuels produced from soybeans and forest residues can reduce significantly the life cycle GHG emissions. The localization of biomass in countryside areas may hamper its production and distribution. However, the countryâ€™s well-established biofuel infrastructure and the high availability of biomass resources may favor biobunker production near coastal areas.

TI  - Cost optimization of a symbiotic system to harvest uranium from seawater via an offshore wind turbine
AB  - The recovery of uranium from seawater has the potential to transform the perceived sustainability of energy generated by uranium intensive nuclear fuel cycles, while providing environmental benefits as compared to land-based mining. Combining a seawater uranium harvester with an existing offshore wind turbine allows for denser energy recovery per unit ecosystem, as well as lowering the uranium production cost. The analysis presented in this paper focuses on the economic impacts on uranium recovered by adsorbing material deployed with such a symbiotic system as compared to a reference kelp-field like deployment. The Wind and Uranium from Seawater Acquisition symBiotic Infrastructure (WUSABI) was subjected to an independent economic analysis and design optimizations in an effort to reduce the seawater uranium cost. In addition to providing greater transparency to previous economic analyses of this system, this work alters chemical tank materials and establishes a novel means of calculating and optimizing the interval in which symbiotic systems are serviced. The perturbations proposed in this work could achieve a cost savings of 30% as compared to uranium produced from the reference kelp-field like deployment system. Additional design sensitivities are also explored to identify major cost drivers and guide future work regarding deployment location of the turbine field. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Greenhouse gas emissions from renewable energy sources: A review of lifecycle considerations
AB  - Electricity and heat generation are key contributors to global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). In this paper, specific attention is paid to renewable energy technologies (RETs) for electricity and heat generation and reviews current understanding and estimates of life cycle GHG emissions from a range of renewable electricity and heat generation technologies. Comprehensive literature reviews for each RET were carried out. The 79 studies reviewed involved the life cycle assessment (LCA) of renewable electricity and heat generation based on onshore and offshore winds, hydropower, marine technologies (wave power and tidal energy), geothermal, photovoltaic (PV), solar thermal, biomass, waste, and heat pumps. The study demonstrates the variability of existing LCA studies (results) in tracking GHG emissions for electricity and heat generation from RETs. This review has shown that the lowest GHG emissions were associated with offshore wind technologies (mean life cycle GHG emissions could be 5.3-13 g CO2 eq/kWh). Results compared with GHG estimates by fossil fuel heat and electricity indicated that life cycle GHG emissions are comparatively higher in conventional sources as compared to renewable sources with the exception of nuclear-based power electricity generation. In this present study, considering renewable energy sources, waste treatment and dedicated biomass technologies (DBTs) were found to potentially have high GHG emissions based on the feedstock, selected boundary and the inputs required for their production. The study identifies additional impacts associated with renewable electricity and heat technologies, points out the effectiveness of life cycle analysis (LCA) as a tool for assessing environmental impacts of renewable energy sources and concludes with opportunities for improvement in the future.

TI  - Chemical engineering challenges and investment opportunities in sustainable energy
AB  - The chemical and energy industries are transforming as they adjust to the new era of high-priced petroleum and severe global warming. As a result of the transformation, engineering challenges and investment opportunities abound. Rapid evolution and fast growth are expected in cathode and anode materials as well as polymeric electrolytes for vehicular batteries and in high-performance polymer-ceramic composites for wind turbines, fuel-efficient aircraft, and lighter and safer cars. Unique process-engineering opportunities exist in sand-oil, coal, and possibly also shale liquefaction to produce transportation fuel; and also in genetic engineering of photosynthesizing plants and other organisms for their processing into high-performance biodegradable polymers and high-value-added environmentally friendly chemicals. Also, research on the feasibility of mitigation of global warming through enhancement of CO 2 uptake by the southern oceans by fertilization with trace amounts of iron is progressing. Because chemical engineers are uniquely well trained in mathematical modeling of mass transport, flow, and mixing, and also in cost analysis, they are likely to join the oceanographers and marine biologists in this important endeavor.

TI  - Scope of cost reduction of ocean energy systems
AB  - The commission of sustainable development though stressed upon use of RE systems replacing fossil fuels - it's use is marginal till date. Pressure over land use and economy limits the use of solar or bio-fuels. Wind Energy resource gets limited being site and time specific. Ocean Energy systems (OE) though have abundant resources and require no land use, but its initial huge capital investment to ensure survivability, limits its large scale use. The present study has hence been taken up to examine the scope of cost reduction inclusive of the three OE systems, such as, Wave, OTEC and Tidal schemes. It included sensitivity analysis for replacement of cheaper construction materials as well as design innovations, for wave and OTEC schemes. However, for Tidal schemes it was on the development of threshold limiting value of barrage constant that served as an instrument in making cost-optimized barrage planning. All these approaches as developed could be shown from case studies made of Pelamis and Wave Dragon type wave energy converters, 100 MW OTEC unit, as well as from a functioning and also a few proposed barrage schemes as planned. RandD areas were also identified on cost reduction aspect for both wave and OTEC schemes that holds wide promise on economy as well as survivability, including considerations of futuristic wave density increases in the eventuality of global warming. .

TI  - Green growth: A promising path to sustainable economic growth
AB  - Energy and environmental issues represent the greatest challenge facing humankind in the 21st century. Soaring prices for conventional energy, the depletion of natural resources and the problem of greenhouse gas emissions have sparked greater interest in and use of both nonconventional and renewable energy sources. Indeed, the transition from oil to multiple energy sources is expected to accelerate in the 21st century. According to conventional thinking, green (environmental) considerations and economic growth are at odds with one another. However, so-called Green Growth is the right way to approach the era of multiple energy sources. This is a virtuous cycle in which protecting the environment can be perceived as a new growth opportunity, and this new growth, inturn, can preserve the environment still more. Countries around the world are already rushing to capitalize on new opportunities that are being created by the environmental industry. Green growth is progressing in 3 main directions: (1) energy source diversification,(2) energy efficiency improvement, and (3) CO2 reduction. Energy source diversification is being led by emission-free coal, FPSO-GTL, marine-based biofuels, next-generation solar cells, and nuclear power. Meanwhile, energy efficiency is being enhanced through advancements in plug-in hybrid vehicles and fuel cell power generation. Finally, both CCS (carbon capture and storage) and technology for converting CO2 into plastics or hydrocarbons are seen as highly promising ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The key to success in green growth lies in the development of breakthrough technologies to lead the industry. Hence, R&amp;D is now more important than ever.

TI  - Omega-7 producing alkaliphilic diatom Fistulifera sp. (Bacillario-phyceae) from Lake Okeechobee, Florida
AB  - Incorporating renewable fuel into practice, especially from algae, is a promising approach in reducing fossil fuel dependency. Algae are an exceptional feedstock since they produce abundant biomass and oils in short timeframes. Algae also produce high-valued lipid products suitable for human nutrition and supplement. Achieving goals of producing algae fuels and high-valued lipids at competitive prices involves further improvement of technology, especially better control over cultivation. Manipulating microalgae cultivation conditions to prevent contamination is essential in addition to promoting optimal growth and lipid yields. Contamination of algal cultures is a major impediment to algae cultivation that can however be mitigated by choosing extremophile microalgae. This work describes the isolation of alkali-tolerant / alkaliphilic microalgae native to South Florida with ideal characteristics for cultivation. For that purpose, water samples from Lake Okeechobee were inoculated into Zarrouk's medium (pH 9-12) and incubated for 35 days. Selection resulted in isolation of three strains that were screened for biomass and lipid accumulation. Two alkali-tolerant algae Chloroldium sp. 154-1 and Chlorella sp. 154-2 were poor lipid accumulators. One of the isolates, the diatom Fistulifera sp. 154-3, was identified as a lipid accumulating, alkaliphilic organism capable of producing 0.233 g L-1 d(-1) dry biomass and a lipid content of 20-30\% dry weight. Lipid analysis indicated the most abundant fatty acid within Fistulifera sp. was palmitoleic acid (52\%), or omega-7, followed by palmitic acid (17\%), and then eicosapentanoic acid (15\%). 18S rRNA phylogenetic analysis formed a well-supported Glade with Fistulifera species.

TI  - Determination of effects of turbulence flow in a cathode environment on electricity generation using a tidal mud-based cylindrical-type sediment microbial fuel cell
AB  - We examined the possibility of harvesting electricity from the surface of a tidal mud flat using a cylindrical-type sediment microbial fuel cell (SMFC), a marine mud battery (MMB), which can be applied in a sea environment where the ebb and flow occur due to tidal difference. In addition, we indirectly investigated the influence of ebb and flow in a lab, using aeration, argon gassing, and by agitating the cathodic solution. The MMBs consisted of cylindrical acrylic compartments containing a nylon membrane, an anode, and a cathode in a single body. The MMBs were stuck vertically into an artificial tidal mud flat such that the anode electrode was in direct contact with the tidal mud surface. As a result, the maximum current and power density generated were 35mA/m2 and 9mW/m2, respectively, thus verifying that it is possible to harvest electricity from the surface of a tidal mud flat using an MMB without burying the anode electrode in the tidal mud. Furthermore, the results of tests using an artificial turbulence flow showed the flow induced by the tidal ebb and flow could allow the performance of MMBs to be enhanced. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Regional variation in the effectiveness of methane-based and land-based climate mitigation options
AB  - Scenarios avoiding global warming greater than 1.5 or 2 degrees C, as stipulated in the Paris Agreement, may require the combined mitigation of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions alongside enhancing negative emissions through approaches such as afforestation-reforestation (AR) and biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). We use the JULES land surface model coupled to an inverted form of the IMOGEN climate emulator to investigate mitigation scenarios that achieve the 1.5 or 2 degrees C warming targets of the Paris Agreement. Specifically, within this IMOGEN-JULES framework, we focus on and characterise the global and regional effectiveness of land-based (BECCS and/or AR) and anthropogenic methane (CH4) emission mitigation, separately and in combination, on the anthropogenic fossil fuel carbon dioxide (CO2) emission budgets (AFFEBs) to 2100. We use consistent data and socio-economic assumptions from the IMAGE integrated assessment model for the second Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP2). The analysis includes the effects of the methane and carbon-climate feedbacks from wetlands and permafrost thaw, which we have shown previously to be significant constraints on the AFFEBs. Globally, mitigation of anthropogenic CH4 emissions has large impacts on the anthropogenic fossil fuel emission budgets, potentially offsetting (i.e. allowing extra) carbon dioxide emissions of 188-212 Gt C. This is because of (a) the reduction in the direct and indirect radiative forcing of methane in response to the lower emissions and hence atmospheric concentration of methane and (b) carbon-cycle changes leading to increased uptake by the land and ocean by CO2-based fertilisation. Methane mitigation is beneficial everywhere, particularly for the major CH4-emitting regions of India, the USA, and China. Land-based mitigation has the potential to offset 51100 Gt C globally, the large range reflecting assumptions and uncertainties associated with BECCS. The ranges for CH4 reduction and BECCS implementation are valid for both the 1.5 and 2 degrees C warming targets. That is the mitigation potential of the CH4 and of the land-based scenarios is similar for regardless of which of the final stabilised warming levels society aims for. Further, both the effectiveness and the preferred land management strategy (i.e. AR or BECCS) have strong regional dependencies. Additional analysis shows extensive BECCS could adversely affect water security for several regions. Although the primary requirement remains mitigation of fossil fuel emissions, our results highlight the potential for the mitigation of CH4 emissions to make the Paris climate targets more achievable.

TI  - Renewable energy resources
AB  - Renewable Energy Resources is a numerate and quantitative text covering the full range of renewable energy technologies and their implementation worldwide. Energy supplies from renewables (such as from biofuels, solar heat, photovoltaics, wind, hydro, wave, tidal, geothermal, and ocean-thermal) are essential components of every nationâ€™s energy strategy, not least because of concerns for the local and global environment, for energy security and for sustainability. Thus in the years between the first and this third edition, most renewable energy technologies have grown from fledgling impact to significant importance because they make good sense, good policy and good business. This Third Edition is extensively updated in light of these developments, while maintaining the bookâ€™s emphasis on fundamentals, complemented by analysis of applications. Renewable energy helps secure national resources, mitigates pollution and climate change, and provides cost effective services. These benefits are analysed and illustrated with case studies and worked examples. The book recognises the importance of cost effectiveness and efficiency of end-use. Each chapter begins with fundamental scientific theory, and then considers applications, environmental impact and socio-economic aspects before concluding with Quick Questions for self-revision and Set Problems. The book includes Reviews of basic theory underlying renewable energy technologies, such as electrical power, fluid dynamics, heat transfer and solid-state physics. Common symbols and cross-referencing apply throughout; essential data are tabulated in appendices. An associated eResource provides supplementary material on particular topics, plus a solutions guide to Set Problems. Renewable Energy Resources supports multi-disciplinary master degrees in science and engineering, and specialist modules in first degrees. Practising scientists and engineers who have not had a comprehensive training in renewable energy will find it a useful introductory text and a reference book.

TI  - Carbon sequestration in an uncertain world
AB  - Carbon sequestration has been proposed as an important means for mitigating climate change, particularly in the medium and longer term. Three approaches have been proposed: biological sequestration in trees and soils; capture from the flue gases of large fossil fuel-using plants, particularly for electric power generation, followed by transport and burial; capture directly from the air, followed by burial. Although biological sequestering in soils and biomass is a natural process, and is seen as the cheapest option, the annual potential is small, and storage may reverse later in the century. Carbon capture and sequestration is probably limited to about one third of annual fossil-fuel related emissions, and will have high energy and money costs if plants are not =capture-ready'. There are no limits on air capture, but it may need more energy than the energy content of the input fuels, and in any case is a high cost approach. Sequestration can be in geological reservoirs such as disused oil and gas fields, or saline aquifers. (Many researchers rule out ocean burial, both because of its adverse environmental effects and because of the temporary nature of storage.) There is however, great uncertainty in the total safe capacity of geological reservoirs. Perhaps even more importantly, the time for absorbtion mechanisms to act varies from immediate to hundreds or even thousands of years, so that annual limits on safe disposal may be the limiting factor.

TI  - Sustainable energy production: Key material requirements
AB  - Sustainable energy contributes to reducing the dependence on the use of fossil fuel resources, thus providing the opportunity to reduce greenhouse gases. The renewable technologies may be divided into three generations. The first commenced in the nineteenth century and was hydro-, biomass- and geothermal-power. The second stage started during the 1980s and consists of wind power, tidal and wave power, and solar power. The third stage is under development and is gasification, bio-refinery and ocean power. This chapter describes and discusses the second generation of renewable technologies and the phase to which each has currently progressed; these developments have been rapid. It also forms an introduction to Chapter 20 which considers the significance of equipment made from advanced polymer composite materials in obtaining sustainable energy.

TI  - The CO2 System of the Baltic Sea: Biogeochemical Control and Impact of Anthropogenic CO2
AB  - The marine CO2 system is controlled by chemical equilibria between the dissolved CO2) species (CO2 (pCO(2)), H2CO3, HCO3-, CO32-) and the hydrogen ion concentration (pH). By gas exchange the system interacts with the atmospheric CO2 and by dissolution/precipitation with solid CaCO3. A major variable of the system is the alkalinity which determines the large scale distribution of the background total CO2 concentration. The background concentrations are modulated by the consumption/production of CO2 by biological production/decomposition of organic matter. The biological production is reflected in the seasonality of the surface water CO2 partial pressure, pCO(2). Two pCO(2) minima are observed in the central Baltic Sea which are due to the CO2 uptake during the spring bloom and during the midsummer production fuelled by nitrogen fixation. The pH is closely related to the pCO(2) and shows two maxima which are coinciding with the pCO(2) minima. Due to the increasing atmospheric CO2 the mean pH in the central Baltic Sea will decrease from currently 8.07 to 7.91 during the next approximately 100 years. The ecological consequences are not yet foreseeable, but may be severe since many biochemical reactions are controlled by the pH. At the same time the CaCO3 saturation will decrease by a factor of almost two and the Baltic Sea surface water will be below saturation for aragonite almost throughout the year. This may affect the abundance of calcifying organisms because their growth is impeded at low CaCO3 saturation.

TI  - Enhanced Terrestrial Carbon Export From East Antarctica During the Early Eocene
AB  - Terrestrial organic carbon (TerrOC) acts as an important CO2 sink when transported via rivers to the ocean and sequestered in coastal marine sediments. This mechanism might help to modulate atmospheric CO2 levels over short- and long- timescales (103â€“106Â years), but its importance during past warm climates remains unknown. Here we use terrestrial biomarkers preserved in coastal marine sediment samples from Wilkes Land, East Antarctica (âˆ¼67Â°S) to quantify TerrOC burial during the early Eocene (âˆ¼54.4â€“51.5Â Ma). Terrestrial biomarker distributions indicate the delivery of plant-, soil-, and peat-derived organic carbon (OC) into the marine realm. Mass accumulation rates of plant- (long-chain n-alkane) and soil-derived (hopane) biomarkers dramatically increase between the earliest Eocene (âˆ¼54Â Ma) and the early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO; âˆ¼53Â Ma). This coincides with increased OC mass accumulation rates and indicates enhanced TerrOC burial during the EECO. Leaf wax Î´2H values indicate that the EECO was characterized by wetter conditions relative to the earliest Eocene, suggesting that hydroclimate exerts a first-order control on TerrOC export. Our results indicate that TerrOC burial in coastal marine sediments could have acted as an important negative feedback mechanism during the early Eocene, but also during other warm climate intervals.

TI  - Sedimentology, diagenesis, and reservoir characterization of the permian white rim sandstone, Southern Utah: Implications for carbon capture and sequestration potential
AB  - Rising CO2 emissions have caused scientists and policy makers to explore potential solutions to reduce atmospheric CO2 levels, including carbon capture and sequestration. This project, funded through the Department of Energy CarbonSAFE initiative, aims to characterize the potential storage capacity and preferential fluid-flow pathways through the Permian White Rim Sandstone on and near the San Rafael Swell, Utah, to assess the formation's viability as a possible CO2 sequestration reservoir. A diverse suite of sedimentological observations and diagenetic analyses was used to assess the White Rim Sandstone's reservoir potential, including detailed outcrop observations, facies descriptions and ichnology, measured stratigraphic sections with associated correlations, permeability measurements, thin-section petrography, and visible and near-infrared spectroscopy. Stratigraphically, the White Rim Sandstone has two major units separated by a marine transgressive surface. The lower eolian unit is characterized by decimeter- to meter-scale trough cross-bedded grain-flow and wind-ripple facies. The upper reworked, shallow-marine unit has a consistent set of facies at all three field sites: (1) soft-sediment deformation facies (e.g., contorted bedding or clastic pipes), (2) symmetric ripple laminations, (3) bioturbated (dominantly horizontal), and (4) bioturbated (dominantly vertical). This set of four facies represents the transgression of the Permian Kaibab sea over the Permian White Rim coastal dune field. The outcrop samples and subsurface core samples (~1561-2243 m deep and ~33-50 km away from the outcrop localities) experienced different diagenetic fluid-flow histories that drastically impacted the reservoir properties. Outcrop samples have initial quartz overgrowth cements followed by rim-forming calcite cements, iron oxide cements, and occasional oil staining. In contrast, the core samples show significant compaction, followed by quartz overgrowth cementation and a later stage of patchy, large, pore-filling calcite cement that eliminated the porosity and permeability of the potential reservoir (&lt;0.1 md). Outcrop permeability values tend to reflect textural differences in facies, particularly the presence and spacing of internal laminations and bounding surfaces. Facies with fewer internal laminations, such as the grain-flow facies, have higher permeability values than facies with closely spaced internal laminae, such as the wind-ripple facies. Disruption of original bedding (e.g., soft-sediment deformation or bioturbation) alters original depositional textures and creates preferential flow pathways with the potential to increase permeability. Overall, if the diagenesis and resulting low permeability values of the core samples are representative of the White Rim Sandstone at depth, then the White Rim Sandstone would not make a high-quality storage reservoir despite initial, promising outcrop results.

TI  - Carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus budgets for a shallow subtropical coastal embayment (Moreton Bay, Australia)
AB  - Average annual carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus budgets were constructed for Moreton Bay. Primary production was the dominant source of carbon (by two orders of magnitude), N fixation was the dominant source of nitrogen, and point sources were the dominant source of phosphorus to the bay. About 41\% of the nitrogen and 70\% of the phosphorus entering Moreton Bay was exported to the ocean, and about 56\% of the nitrogen was lost to denitrification. The high percentage loss of phosphorus to the ocean was directly related to the short residence time of the bay (46 d), which was consistent with other shallow coastal ecosystems. In contrast, the percentage loss of nitrogen to the ocean was low compared to other coastal systems due to the high percentage loss through denitrification associated with autotrophic sediments in the bay that enhance denitrification. Because most denitrification studies have been carried out using only dark incubations, the importance of denitrification to the nitrogen budgets of coastal systems in general may be underestimated. Carbon loss from Moreton Bay was dominated (by two orders of magnitude) by atmospheric exchange of CO, associated with benthic and pelagic respiration. The distinct difference between Moreton Bay (subtropical) and temperate systems was the dominance of biological (microbial: N fixation and denitrification) over physical inputs and losses of nitrogen. High N fixation in turn fuels a positive annual mean net ecosystem metabolism (NEM) of 21 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and suggests that primary production in the bay is phosphorus limited at the whole ecosystem scale.

TI  - U.S. renewable electricity generation: Resources and challenges
AB  - The United States faces important decisions about future energy supply and use. A key question is how renewable energy resources might be used to meet U.S. energy needs in general, and to meet U.S. electricity needs specifically. Renewable energy sources are typically used for three general types of applications: electricity generation, biofuels/bioproducts, and heating/cooling. Each application uses different technologies to convert renewable energy sources into usable products. The literature on renewable energy resources, conversion technologies for different applications, and economics is massive. This report focuses on electricity generation from renewable energy sources. In 2010, renewable sources of energy were used to produce almost 11% (7% from hydropower and 4% from other renewables) of the 4 million gigawatthours of electricity generated in the United States. This report provides a summary of U.S. electricity generation potential from wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, ocean-hydrokinetic, and biomass sources of renewable energy. The focus of this report is twofold: (1) provide an assessment of U.S. renewable electricity generation potential and how renewables might satisfy electric power sector demand, and (2) discuss challenges, issues, and barriers that might limit renewable electricity generation deployment. Data sources from 15 different organizations were reviewed to derive estimates of electricity generation potential. One key finding is that there exists no uniform national assessment of renewable electricity generation potential. No standard methods or set of assumptions are used to estimate renewable electricity generation potential. So even existing assessments for individual energy sources are difficult to compare objectively. In order to compare various estimates on an equivalent basis, CRS engaged experts in each renewable energy resource area to help normalize electricity generation potential estimates into a common metric: gigawatthours per year. After surveying, researching, and normalizing all of the third-party electricity generation estimates, results indicate that renewable energy sources may, in principle, have the potential to satisfy a large portion of U.S. electricity demand. However, a number of potential barriers to large-scale deployment exist, including cost, power system integration, intermittency and variability, land requirements, transmission access, possible limits to the availability of key materials and resources, certain environmental impacts, specialized infrastructure requirements, and policy issues. Ultimately, the amount of renewable electricity generation in the U.S. may be dependent on the ability to address these deployment barriers. The Energy Information Administration projects that U.S. renewable electricity generation will increase from 11% today to between 14% and 15% in 2035. As Congress considers policy options associated with increasing renewable electricity generation, policy makers may assess potential benefits such as emissions reduction, job creation, and global competitiveness, along with possible risks and consequences such as electricity cost and price increases, electricity delivery reliability, and environmental impacts associated with large-scale deployment of renewable electricity generation technologies.

TI  - Sustainable Fertilizer Strategies for Vaccinium corymbosum x V. angustifolium under Abandoned Peatland Conditions
AB  - Revegetating abandoned peatlands plays an important role in reducing the CO2 footprint. One possibility for carbon reduction is cultivating blueberries as calcifuge plants in acidic peat soil. The aim of the experiment was to find out the effect of different fertilizers on half-highbush blueberry cultivar `Northblue' growth and biochemical parameters in peatland conditions. The experiment was carried out in 2011-2015 with four organic and one mineral fertilizer, where three were composted chicken manure- and one maltose-based organic fertilizer. The soil of the experimental area belongs to the soil subgroup Fibri-Dystric Histosol with the peat layer 1.0-1.5 m deep. Organic fertilizer 4-1-2, which contained seaweed but had low phosphorus and potassium content, resulted in high yields in 2011 and 2013, with similar vegetative growth and comparable biochemical parameters as mineral fertilizer 6-14-23. The principal component analysis showed that the experimental year was more important in determining fruit parameters than the fertilizer type. However, our results indicated that the organic fertilizers are alternatives to mineral fertilizer for organic production.

TI  - Enhanced electricity production by use of reconstituted artificial consortia of estuarine bacteria grown as biofilms
AB  - Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) can convert organic compounds directly into electricity by catalytic oxidation, and although MFCs have attracted considerable interest, there is little information on the electricity-generating potential of artificial bacterial biofilms. We have used acetate-fed MFCs inoculated with sediment, with two-chamber bottles and carbon cloth electrodes to deliver a maximum power output of âˆ¼175 mWâ€¢m -2 and a stable power output of âˆ¼105 mWâ€¢m -2. Power production was by direct transfer of electrons to the anode from bacterial consortia growing on the anode, as confirmed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Twenty different species (74 strains) of bacteria were isolated from the consortium under anaerobic conditions and cultured in the laboratory, of which 34% were found to be exoelectrogens in single-species studies. Exoelectrogenesis by members of the genera Vibrio, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter and by Bacillus stratosphericus was confirmed, by use of culture-based methods, for the first time. An MFC with a natural bacterial consortium showed higher power densities than those obtained with single strains. In addition, the maximum power output could be further increased to âˆ¼200 mWâ€¢m -2 when an artificial consortium consisting of the best 25 exoelectrogenic isolates was used, demonstrating the potential for increased performance and underlying the importance of artificial biofilms for increasing power output.

TI  - National microalgae biofuel production potential and resource demand
AB  - Microalgae are receiving increased global attention as a potential sustainable "energy crop" for biofuel production. An important step to realizing the potential of algae is quantifying the demands commercial-scale algal biofuel production will place on water and land resources. We present a high-resolution spatiotemporal assessment that brings to bear fundamental questions of where production can occur, how many land and water resources are required, and how much energy is produced. Our study suggests that under current technology, microalgae have the potential to generate 220 Ã— 10 9 L yr-1 of oil, equivalent to 48% of current U.S. petroleum imports for transportation. However, this level of production requires 5.5% of the land area in the conterminous United States and nearly three times the water currently used for irrigated agriculture, averaging 1421 L water per liter of oil. Optimizing the locations for microalgae production on the basis of water use efficiency can greatly reduce total water demand. For example, focusing on locations along the Gulf Coast, southeastern seaboard, and Great Lakes shows a 75% reduction in consumptive freshwater use to 350 L per liter of oil produced with a 67% reduction in land use. These optimized locations have the potential to generate an oil volume equivalent to 17% of imports for transportation fuels, equal to the Energy Independence and Security Act year 2022 "advanced biofuels" production target and utilizing some 25% of the current irrigation demand. With proper planning, adequate land and water are available to meet a significant portion of the U.S. renewable fuel goals. Copyright Â© 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.

TI  - Effective mitigation of climate change with sustainable development of energy, water and environment systems
AB  - The urgency of mitigating climate change comes with opportunities to transition society towards a more sustainable future. Numerous options exist for immediate, deep, and sustained efforts to realise a 43\% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Beyond the recent reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this editorial extends insight into new research advances for integrated approaches that can support effective climate mitigation. Based on the 16th Conference on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water, and Environment Systems, the review in this editorial interconnects the 28 research articles in this special issue within a broader context across eight main themes. The first theme on 100\% renewable energy systems emphasizes recent advances in modelling and sector coupling, extending to the optimization of positive energy districts and energy communities at the local level and ultra-low temperature district heating and cooling networks. Energy security with sustainable energy solutions involves electrification, renewable energy, and energy savings. Transforming transport for energy transition solutions and new frontiers in renewable energy technologies cover advances for smart energy districts, electric vehicles, accurate forecasting of long-term wind speed, hydrogen propulsion in marine vessels, and innovations for water quality monitoring. System restructuring for the energy transition is supported with research contributions on time variability and environmental signalling in electricity markets, dedicated price structures for energy community trading, flexibilisation, and repurposing drilling sites for deep geothermal energy. Thematically, upgrading of biomass for biofuel production, green hydrogen innovations and heat transfer as well sustainable combustion complete the special issue. New catalysts, hybrid reaction for lignocellulosic biofuels, hydrogen fuel cell electrocatalyst, and waste heat recovery from granules in concentrating solar power or slags are some of the research advances under these themes. The widespread upscaling of solutions for mitigating climate change requires an effective approach that involves integrated, coordinated, and synergistic action now as the only chance for better protecting the life-support systems of the planet.

TI  - Efficient utilization and management of seaweed biomass for biogas production
AB  - The global trend of seaweed production and their biomass utilization for biofuels generation is increased due to the high carbohydrate and protein content. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a promising technology to convert organic compounds of seaweed biomass into biogas. However, a comprehensive review enclosing the biomethane potential, process parameters, microbial shifts, and effective approaches to enhance the digestibility and biogas production from seaweeds has not been reported. Thus, this article aims to explore, classify, and comprehensively present the potential of seaweeds for biogas production. The global trend of biofuels including biogas production from seaweed biomass is elucidated. The effect of seasonal variations on the biochemical composition of seaweeds is highlighted. The microbial community involved in AD of seaweeds is discussed. This article also covers the pretreatments, co-digestion, supplementation of additives, and sequential utilization of seaweeds to enhance biogas production. The seasonal variations significantly affected the composition of seaweeds and subsequently altered the content of inhibitory compounds. The application of different strategies (such as pretreatment) mitigated the effect of inhibitors and boosted biogas production. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were reported to be the major bacteria and Methanobacteriales were the dominant archaea during the digestion of seaweeds. Extensive research on microbial dynamics and the application of co-digestion is still needed to achieve complete utilization of biomass coupled with biogas enhancement.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Evolution of carbon sinks in a changing climate
AB  - Climate change is expected to influence the capacities of the land and oceans to act as repositories for anthropogenic CO2 and hence provide a feedback to climate change. A series of experiments with the National Center for Atmospheric Research-Climate System Model 1 coupled carbon-climate model shows that carbon sink strengths vary with the rate of fossil fuel emissions, so that carbon storage capacities of the land and oceans decrease and climate warming accelerates with faster CO2 emissions. Furthermore, there is a positive feedback between the carbon and climate systems, so that climate warming acts to increase the airborne fraction of anthropogenic CO2 and amplify the climate change itself. Globally, the amplification is small at the end of the 21st century in this model because of its low transient climate response and the near-cancellation between large regional changes in the hydrologic and ecosystem responses. Analysis of our results in the context of comparable models suggests that destabilization of the tropical land sink is qualitatively robust, although its degree is uncertain.

TI  - Advances in production & activation of marine macroalgae-derived biochar catalyst for sustainable biodiesel production
AB  - Biodiesel is considered as a promising sustainable biofuel from renewable resources with lower pollutant emissions. However, high production cost, difficulty in recovering catalyst, and an expensive separation process associated with the use of homogeneous catalysts are still critical challenges. Heterogeneous catalysts derived from biomass are considered as viable options. Marine macroalgae-derived biochar owing to its vast surface area, diverse functional groups, presence of inorganics, and high porosity, could be considered as a suitable heterogeneous catalyst or as a supported catalyst for biodiesel synthesis. Thermochemical conversion processes, such as hydrothermal carbonization and pyrolysis, convert marine macroalgae biomass into biochar, which primarily composed of carbon, oxygen, and inorganics (Ca, K, Mg, Fe, etc.). The activation of macroalgae-derived biochar either physically or chemically played a vital role towards biofuel production. The catalytic activity and the performance of the macroalgae-derived biochar catalyst are influenced by its physicochemical properties (â€“SO3H group density, porosity, overall surface area, functional groups, and so on). Biodiesel production over marine macroalgae-derived biochar catalyst represents a more sustainable solution to current energy demands and develops economically beneficial biodiesel technology. This article provides a critical assessment of the marine macroalgae-derived biochar catalysts for the production of biodiesel. Initially, macroalgal biochar is produced through different thermochemical conversion technologies, including hydrothermal carbonization and pyrolysis, and its yield and physicochemical characteristics are discussed. After that, various techniques for the activation of macroalgae-derived biochar are discussed. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Utilization of Putative Enterobacter Isolate and Substrates for Microbial Fuel Cells
AB  - The current Philippine energy crisis reminds us of the importance of finding alternative energy sources. Microbial fuel cells (MFC) may contribute to the solution. MFCs utilizing marine sediments, rice straw, domestic sewage, and agricultural water have a large potential as an alternative energy source. The objectives of the project were to isolate the biological agent, determine the optimum waste substrates, and to develop a working microbial fuel cell using locally available materials as fuel source. Soil, sediment, and corn stover were collected. An improvised MFC was constructed with two compartments for the anode and cathode sections separated by an agar plug (5\% w/v). Each compartment had 750 ml capacities. Several combinations of materials were determined. Triplicates of each material-isolate combination were used to determine voltage, amperage, and Columbic output. Thirty percent fish farm sediments produced the highest voltage and amperage. This treatment was able to produce power for 7 to 25 days after MFC setup. Addition of ammonium sulfate in this setup reduced electrical output. Other treatments also produced power but were not as comparable. This study showed that utilizing wastes as substrate for MFCs is feasible and may have practical use.

TI  - Grazing control and iron limitation of primary production in the Arabian Sea: Implications for anticipated shifts in Southwest Monsoon intensity
AB  - The Arabian Sea is important in global biogeochemistry because of its high rates of primary production, its extensive zone of oxygen depletion and denitrification, and its expected strong response to global warming via ocean-atmosphere feedbacks to monsoon winds and upwelling intensity. Monsoon-driven upwelling leads to higher rates of primary production during the summer. However, the Arabian Sea paradoxically produces a weak and delayed phytoplankton response compared to other physically dynamic upwelling systems, and indeed has many of the characteristics of a high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) regime. Thick blooms of large diatoms are uniquely not evident in the Arabian Sea despite apparently abundant nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and silicate), seed stocks and hydrographic conditions that appear conducive. The subdued bloom response shifts carbon export offshore of the coastal upwelling area and delays major flux events until the latter stages of the SW Monsoon. While the US Joint Global Ocean Flux Study in the Arabian Sea concluded that these observations can be explained by top-down control of primary production by grazers, recent data suggest that primary production may be limited by iron, consistent with other upwelling regimes. In this review, we examine the evidence for each hypothesis and offer some explanations that are consistent with both control mechanisms. We also assess how each hypothesis might explain how shifts in monsoon intensity and duration associated with climate change will affect Arabian Sea biogeochemistry. A strengthening monsoon will exacerbate iron limitation. This will lead to an eastward shift in the utilization of upwelled nutrients and intensify the oxygen minimum zone. A weakening monsoon will probably make iron limitation less important in the system. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Issues for storing plant-based alternative fuels in marine environments
AB  - Two coastal seawaters (Key West, FL USA and the Persian Gulf, Bahrain, representing oligotrophic and eutrophic environments, respectively) were used to evaluate potential biodegradation and corrosion problems during exposure to alternative and conventional fuels. Uncoated carbon steel was exposed at the fuel/seawater interface and polarization resistance was monitored. Under typical marine storage conditions, dioxygen in natural seawater exposed to fuel and carbon steel was reduced to <0.1 parts-per-million within 2 d due to consumption by corrosion reactions and aerobic microbial respiration. Sulfides, produced by anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria, and chlorides were co-located in corrosion products. Transient dioxygen influenced both metabolic degradation pathways and resulting metabolites. Catechols, indicative of aerobic biodegradation, persisted after 90 d exposures. Detection of catechols suggested that initial exposure to dioxygen resulted in the formation of aerobic metabolites that exacerbated subsequent corrosion processes. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Performance of an Acoustic Sensing Array in an Energetic Tidal Channel
AB  - sounds in real time. TheNoiseSpotter consists of a three-dimensional bottom-mounted array of three acoustic vector sensors cabledto a surface buoy for real-time telemetry. Each sensor measures acoustic pressure and three-dimensionalparticle velocity associated with the propagation of an acoustic wave. The NoiseSpotter was deployed in an energetic tidal channel with a tidal oscillation that can approach3 m. Performance characteristics in the presence of the resulting flow noise is quantified, and a flownoise suppression system is quantitatively shown to significantly improve performance, with flow noisesuppression close to 15 dB. Performance is significantly improved when the sensors are housed in aflow noise removal shield, which provides acoustic transparency while reducing non-acoustic signalcontamination. Long term durability of this flow-noise suppression shield is demonstrated using biofoulingexperiments. The real-time telemetry of data digests is demonstrated to allow rapid decision-making inresponse to measured sound intensity levels.,In support of environmental monitoring technologies to evaluate the acoustic impact of marine energyoperations, a cost-effective compact array of acoustic sensors has been developed that characterizes,classifies, and provides accurate location information for anthropogenic and natural.

TI  - Between Tun Mustapha and the deep blue sea: The political ecology of blue carbon in Sabah
AB  - Coastal 'blue carbon' ecosystem resources are rich carbon stores, offer extensive benefits beyond carbon sequestration, and are marginalized in global markets and policy mechanisms. The participation of blue carbon project activities in international market frameworks is limited by a dearth of appropriate research across disciplinary boundaries, particularly in terms of the cultural and political dynamics that affect project implementation. The socially and politically charged contexts of many developing countries constrain project opportunities, and understanding specific local governance dynamics is therefore of critical importance to policy makers, development practitioners, and the private sector. This paper applies a systems-based political ecology research and analytical approach to explore the social and political dynamics affecting the potential development of blue carbon projects in a proposed marine reserve in Sabah, Malaysia. The investigative focus is situated in its historical context, described and mapped as an influence system in collaboration with local experts, with the elements of that system then explored in detail, through a workshop, survey, and interviews with a diverse range of local stakeholders. Key findings include that historical realities play a vital role in present relationships; effective governance is likely to require international collaboration to minimize inequity and corruption; race and religion continue to be used as tools of political imperialism; and dominant actors in Sabah would be well advised to recognize the growing, informed cohesion of Sabahan society, and its drive for equitable, ecologically sustainable development. The paper contributes a novel methodological approach to sustainability science research, provides unique data on a case study area relevant to climate change policy, and identifies important leverage points for the development of blue carbon finance and policy instruments in South-East Asia and beyond.

TI  - Green chemistry. Renewable raw materials. Shell company to produce bio-fuels at Hawaii based on algae [Chimie verte. MatiÃ¨res premiÃ¨res renouvelables. Shell va produire des biocarburants Ã  base d'algues Ã  HawaÃ¯]
AB  - Royal Dutch Shell and HR Biopetroleum companies jointly prepare for the construction of a pilot plant in Hawaii that will cultivate marine algae to produce vegetable oils and bio-fuels. Their joint effort is called Cellana. This is another stage in the effort of the Shell company to develop a new generation of bio-fuels from sustainable non-foodstuff raw materials. The algae are promising because they grow fast, are rich in vegetable oils, and can be cultivated in basins of sea water, reducing to a minimum the use of fertile earth and fresh water. Shell is the majority shareholder of Cellana. The site, on loan from the Natural Laboratory of the Hawaii Authority (NELHA) is near commercial companies that specialize in algae for the industry of nutrition and of pharmaceuticals. The algae will come from Hawaii or will be approved by the Hawaii Ministry of Agriculture. Once harvested, the vegetable oil in the algae will be extracted. The program will have recourse to counsel in science from the Universities of Hawaii, Southern Mississippi, and, in Nova Scotia, Dalhousie. Algae have the advantage of rapid growth. They can double their volume several times in one day and produce much more oil per acre than alternative vegetables such as rapeseed oil, palm oil, soya oil, or jatropha oil. Also, the facilities can be built along the coasts, thus not inconveniencing traditional agriculture. In the long term, the aquatic farms can absorb or capture the carbon dioxide emissions directly from industrial facilities such as power plants. The Cellana demonstration plant will use carbon dioxide stored in cylinders to explore this potential.

TI  - Wide coverage but few quantitative data: Coarse sediments in the English Channel
AB  - Offshore Wind Farms (OWFs) in the English Channel and along the coast of Normandy (France) will be installed on coarse sediments, which cover about 80% of the seabed of the English Channel. A BACI (Before After Control Impact) approach has been recommended by the French State for each of these OWFs. This provides the opportunity to acquire macrofauna data and assess the Ecological Quality Status in areas that are poorly sampled. In the case of the Dieppe-Le TrÃ©port (DLT) OWF, for that, a sampling strategy was developed in 2014â€“2016 to establish a â€˜Beforeâ€™ state for the sediment and macrofauna. Results highlight that the DLT OWF project site includes three different sediment type: sandy Gravel (sG), gravelly Sand (gS) and medium Sand (mS). Taxonomic Richness and abundances are dominated by Annelids in all three habitats, followed by Arthropods and Molluscs. In terms of biomass, Molluscs (bivalves) are predominant in sG and gS, while Echinoderms and Polychaetes along with bivalves represent a high fraction of the biomass in mS. Surface Deposit Feeders are the most important group in terms of abundance, while Filter feeders largely dominate the biomass. The benthic indices based on abundances reveal a high Ecological Quality Status for the three sediment types. However, due to the predominant contribution of the bivalve Glycymeris glycymeris to the biomass, the habitat quality appears to vary from moderate to bad. In comparison with other similar habitats, the Taxonomic Richness and Abundances of coarse sediments and medium sand are in the same order of magnitude as other sites. However, the biomasses are among the highest so far recorded, reflecting the importance of this area as a hotspot of biomass in the English Channel. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Converting beach wrack into a resource as a challenge for the Baltic Sea (an overview)
AB  - The paper distinguishes beach wrack, the marine generated organic part of beach cast, as a separate management object and discusses research questions related to its management and economically viable use. Based on experiences from the Baltic Sea and existing practices from countries with different management systems clear distinction between the management of natural and anthropogenic components of cast material is seen as an essential prerequisite for developing sustainable product chains that allow beach wrack to be used as a resource of commercial value. Presenting and discussing examples from Denmark (KÃ¸ge Municipality), Germany (KÃ¼hlungsborn, RÃ¼gen and Poel Island), Poland (Gulf of Gdansk), Russia (Curonian and Vistula spits) and Sweden (Kalmar municipality and Ã–land), social, ecological, and economic consequences of beach wrack removal are analysed to improve the attractiveness of beaches for recreational purposes. It also includes potential contribution to Baltic Sea water restoration processes through the removal of the organic part of beach cast, where indeed more studies about the chemical (nutrients, metals) composition of beach wrack are required for reliable calculation of a depuration rate. For local economies within the Baltic Sea region, the organic part of beach cast (beach wrack and terrestrial debris) has reasonable economic prospects as a renewable natural resource, e.g. for soil improvement products, in fertilisers and bio-coal production, for landfill covers (contributing to climate change mitigation), biogas generation, and even for coastal protection by providing humus-like material for accelerated dune vegetation succession. For all these recycling options the development of cost-efficient technologies for collecting beach cast on sandy as well as stony beaches and also for separating the organic part from sand and anthropogenic litter (mainly plastic), is urgently required. Amendments of legal regulations, that better reflect the dualism of beach cast are also required. In essence, dualism results from the fact that beach wrack is a part of nature (or a natural resource) when it remains on a beach. However, beach wrack immediately becomes legally categorised as waste once humans collect it irrespective of its litter content. Another legal aspect being dealt with originates from the migration of the beach wrack between water and beach, whilst it is an object of ÐµÑ€leagl cleaning operations only at the beach it onto the beach, but not whilst in the water.

TI  - Modular waste/renewable energy system for production of electricity, heat, and potable water in remote locations
AB  - Methods and designs for a modular waste processing system that will utilize an anaerobic process to produce hydrogen from food, animal, or human waste are being developed by this ongoing research effort. This hydrogen will be used to produce electricity in a reciprocating engine or fuel cell. A solar energy system has been designed and tested to provide heat for pre and post processing of waste and production of potable water. Potentially harmful pathogens from the waste are isolated from the environment and are drastically reduced by a thermal process. It is anticipated that this combined waste processing and renewable energy unit would be constructed in a standard shipping container for use in undeveloped and/or remote locations or at disaster sites. Hydrogen has many well established advantages as a clean renewable energy source. The use of microbial organisms to produce hydrogen has many advantages over more conventional techniques. Remote locations place a premium on the availability of electricity, heat, and potable water. Methane production by biological means is often used for producing electricity. Using microorganisms that produce hydrogen rather than methane significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions for the overall process. By using this hydrogen in a reciprocating engine or fuel cell the major end products would be electricity, water, and heat. To produce hydrogen rather than methane an aerobically it is necessary to first thermally pretreat the feed material. The developed solar energy system has consistently produced temperatures above 115Â°aC. Typical hydrogen concentrations produced in the fermentation using food waste are 22% after 48 hours. Current efforts include use of a statistical experimental design to determine optimal operating parameters and a preliminary modular energy system design. The next steps in this effort will involve research and development of a bench-top prototype system and subsequently development and testing of a full scale prototype unit. Â© 2011 IEEE.

TI  - METHANOL AS MARINE FUEL BUILDS MOMENTUM
AB  - Methanol-fueled ships have already been built to equivalent technology standards so the flag state and classification community understands it is safe and practical. Research undertaken for the Methanol Institute suggests it can be bunkered at more than 100 ports globally and is either available on site or within close proximity to berths, with very little modification required to the existing bunkering infrastructure. The Methanol Institute is currently engaged in a pilot project in Singapore converting a crew transport service vessel which will also bunker Methanol regularly. Among the elements being studied is the availability of both conventional and renewable/bio methanol to move further towards a low/net carbon neutral environment, faster and in an economically viable manner. Based on over 60,000 hr of dual fuel engine testing conducted over three years by MAN Energy Solutions, a two-stroke engine running on methanol can reduce CO2 emissions by 15% compared with Tier II engines on HFO. Maritime start-up FUELSAVE has attracted more ship owners to its FS MARINE+ process for dynamic and load-based injection of hydrogen, oxygen, methanol, and water into marine engine fuel delivery systems. This resulted in the cleaner and more thorough combustion of fuel, typically HFO, is a dilution of the effects of a dirty primary fuel with a clean-burning alcohol distillate. FS MARINE+ is an efficiency enhancement and emissions reduction solution that achieves real net cost savings while reducing a vesselâ€™s carbon footprint and air pollution.

TI  - Design of 1 MWe ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) heat exchangers for ocean testing.
AB  - Designs for a shell-and-tube evaporator and condenser, each having an approximate thermal duty of 40 MW, have been developed as a part of the U.S. Department of Energy's Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) programme. The designs for each heat exchanger are described, including both thermal/hydraulic and mechanical design considerations. Experiments have been used to determine the shell side heat transfer coefficients and to aid in the selection of tube geometry. Several unique design features are include in the evaporator which permit flexible operation as either a pool boiling or spraying bundle unit through the use of removable shrouds. Use of the shrouds also permits the evaluation of liquid entrainment effects with increased vapour velocity. (from authors' abstract)

TI  - The Utility of Satellites and Autonomous Remote Sensing Platforms for Monitoring Offshore Aquaculture Farms: A Case Study for Canopy Forming Kelps
AB  - The emerging sector of offshore kelp aquaculture represents an opportunity to produce biofuel feedstock to help meet growing energy demand. Giant kelp represents an attractive aquaculture crop due to its rapid growth and production, however precision farming over large scales is required to make this crop economically viable. These demands necessitate high frequency monitoring to ensure outplant success, maximum production, and optimum quality of harvested biomass, while the long distance from shore and large necessary scales of production makes in person monitoring impractical. Remote sensing offers a practical monitoring solution and nascent imaging technologies could be leveraged to provide daily products of the kelp canopy and subsurface structures over unprecedented spatial scales. Here, we evaluate the efficacy of remote sensing from satellites and aerial and underwater autonomous vehicles as potential monitoring platforms for offshore kelp aquaculture farms. Decadal-scale analyses of the Southern California Bight showed that high offshore summertime cloud cover restricts the ability of satellite sensors to provide high frequency direct monitoring of these farms. By contrast, daily monitoring of offshore farms using sensors mounted to aerial and underwater drones seems promising. Small Unoccupied Aircraft Systems (sUAS) carrying lightweight optical sensors can provide estimates of canopy area, density, and tissue nitrogen content on the time and space scales necessary for observing changes in this highly dynamic species. Underwater color imagery can be rapidly classified using deep learning models to identify kelp outplants on a longline farm and high acoustic returns of kelp pneumatocysts from side scan sonar imagery signal an ability to monitor the subsurface development of kelp fronds. Current sensing technologies can be used to develop additional machine learning and spectral algorithms to monitor outplant health and canopy macromolecular content, however future developments in vehicle and infrastructure technologies are necessary to reduce costs and transcend operational limitations for continuous deployment in an offshore setting.

TI  - Effects of leachate recirculation on biogas production from landfill co-disposal of municipal solid waste, sewage sludge and marine sediment
AB  - Leachate recirculation is an emerging technology associated with the management of landfill. The impact of leachate recirculation on the co-disposal of three major wastes (Municipal solid waste, sewage sludge and sediment dredgings) was investigated using a laboratory column study. Chemical parameters (pH. COD, ammoniacal-N, total-P) and gas production (total gas volume, production rates and concentrations of CH4 and CO2) were monitored for 11 weeks. Leachate recirculation reduced waste-stabilization time and was effective in enhancing gas production and improving leachate quality, especially in terms of COD. The results also indicated that leachate recirculation could maximize the efficiency and waste volume reduction rate of landfill sites. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Resolving issues with environmental impact assessment of marine renewable energy installations
AB  - Growing concerns about climate change and energy security have fueled a rapid increase in the development of marine renewable energy installations (MREIs). The potential ecological consequences of increased use of these devices emphasizes the need for high quality environmental impact assessment (EIA). We demonstrate that these processes are hampered severely, primarily because ambiguities in the legislation and lack of clear implementation guidance are such that they do not ensure robust assessment of the significance of impacts and cumulative effects. We highlight why the regulatory framework leads to conceptual ambiguities and propose changes which, for the most part, do not require major adjustments to standard practice. We emphasize the importance of determining the degree of confidence in impacts to permit the likelihood as well as magnitude of impacts to be quantified and propose ways in which assessment of population-level impacts could be incorporated into the EIA process. Overall, however, we argue that, instead of trying to ascertain which particular developments are responsible for tipping an already heavily degraded marine environment into an undesirable state, emphasis should be placed on better strategic assessment.

TI  - Essential but not inevitable: Navigating into a nuclear-powered future
AB  - The World is in the grip of anti-nuclear terrorism. A small, fanatical minority of anti-nuclear activists is insisting that the looming problems of global warming and ocean acidification can be handled by deployment of renewable energy sources, additional "clean" carbon fuels, and by conservation. The technical community knows that this will be expensive and ineffective. Wind power is the nearest-term prospect, and is growing, but its electricity output is far below the expected levels. Its intermittency has meant that wind is unable to supply more than a few percent of a grid's electricity demand before the benefit of CO2 reduction disappears in emissions from stand-by generators [1]. Yet while the world's governments dither, nature and our energy use are setting the timescales. Like many others, our analyses of energy-use scenarios show that the World is going to become wanner over the next 30 years [2] and there is little that can now be done to change this. But, if world society starts immediately to take responsibility for our legacy to future generations, the rise thereafter can be sharply slowed. Action in the first half of this century is crucial and we have the technology to take action in the form of nuclear fission to bridge us to a sustainable energy future. Depending on the total amount of energy consumed world-wide, between an additional 4400 to 14 000 nuclear reactors of 1000 MW would need to be deployed by 2050. This is a large deployment but most is new generating capacity that will provide some equality in energy supplies to developing countries. Sensible, nuclear-rich scenarios differ from business-as-usual ones only in the form of this additional capacity, not by displacing existing fossil fuels Given the uncertainties in climate modelling, the Earth's climate could contain cusps beyond which positive feedback takes control of the planet's climate and places it entirely beyond human influence. At what point this will occur is irresolvable speculation. However, the increased concentration of CO2 in surface ocean water is one aspect of CO2 emissions that had been largely overlooked until recently and the ocean's response to CO2 emissions is much more certain. The changes to the oceans are predictable with complete certainty and the resulting shift of carbonate ions (CO32-) to bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) will reduce or eliminate supersaturation of the carbonate, disrupting or destroying the lifecycle of much of the ocean's phytoplankton [3]. Phytoplankton is the base of the oceans' entire food chain as well as an important mechanism for long-term sequestration of CO2 through their rain of detritus to the deep ocean bottoms. Action does not require technology that has yet to be developed or that is beyond our technical and financial capabilities. Yet, even with Kyoto's coming into force and the commitment of most world leaders to limiting greenhouse gas emissions [4], effective political action remains rare. What is needed to unlock the logjam? Nuclear power has determined opponents, who have shaped public opinion highly effectively. The anti-nuclear environmental movement activists (ANEMA) basically opposes nuclear energy because it is large-scale and requires seemingly abstruse technology. The ANEMAs' visceral position is not readily altered, but, because the public might judge it somewhat skeptically, ANEMA have raised a series of detailed objections designed to cause public alarm. The five most effective are nuclear energy's cost, reactor safety, waste disposal, insufficient fuel resource, and nuclear proliferation. The nuclear industry has evidently failed so far to provide the rebuttal to all of these that is likely a precondition of a massive fuel switch. Until these artificial barriers are removed by us, the insiders of the nuclear industry, our technical solution of an effective, non-polluting energy source cannot be applied on the scale needed to deflect global society from its current catastrophic course. The answers are not difficult: â€¢ The cost of nuclear energy should not be an issue. Our company, Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, has a consistent record of building CANDU-6Â®1 reactors around the world on-time and within-budget. Our ACRÂ®2 design and other Generation III+ reactor designs from other vendors further lower the capital cost of nuclear to a point where it is competitive with coal. â€¢ High standards for reactor safety have been established worldwide, through the activities of operators, designers and WANO (the World Association of Nuclear Operators). Still, the evidence has not yet removed the public's paranoia over traces of radioactivity. â€¢ Spent fuel storage is no longer a technical issue. Approaches to geological disposal have been independently developed and verified in a number of countries including Canada, Finland and the USA. What we have neglected to emphasise is the four to six orders of magnitude reduction in the amount of waste produced by nuclear power compared to the mountains of waste produced (and generally released) by carbon-based energy sources. â€¢ Proliferation and terrorism have never arisen from nuclear power reactors. That is almost certain to remain true: would anyone create a mining industry as a cover for misuse of conventional explosives? Still, this is the most difficult issue to address because these are grave problems and not susceptible to any single solution. Before the ANEMA reconfigure an old argument as: "better red (from heat) than dead (from a nuclear explosion)", we in the nuclear industry need to persuade public opinion that a world with adequate, sustainable supplies of energy is less likely to produce and shelter the fanatics who would resort to any sort of terrorism. Almost all technology can be misapplied. But we have not abandoned chemistry, simply because it led to explosives with the demonstrated capacity to kill and maim countless millions. We have not abandoned air, road and rail transport, despite their leading to the accidental deaths of thousands every year. Nor have we abandoned biology, though it has the capacity to devise new plague-creating organisms. Nuclear energy can be misused but it is the only safe foundation for the world's energy supplies for at least the next 50 years and our first task is to convince our public opinions of it.

TI  - Future offshore technology and sustained reliability
AB  - The coastlines of the United States, both eastern and western, and the Gulf of Mexico have excellent wind resources. The wind resources are near major population areas whereby power can be generated having a minimum distance to the end user. The continental shelves that surround the U.S. allow placement of wind power systems in both state and federally controlled waters. Employing the technologies generated for oil and gas offshore operations as well as the advancements of large megawatt class generators, will allow great flexibility to provide efficient offshore wind farms. The choice of support of the platform is discussed in the paper. The means and methods for installation of the platform, including cost comparisons are also included in this paper. Wind farms have an expected useful life of 25 to 30 years. This paper discusses the design of the wind farm to accommodate the necessary maintenance required during the useful life of the wind farm. The cost of offshore maintenance is also illustrated in comparison to long-term power purchase agreements. This report illustrates the types of structures, installation costs and maintenance costs which the wind farm developer will be subjected to. The future of offshore technology is discussed regarding the use of ocean bottom conditions to be the most efficient and reliable type of renewable energy.

TI  - Energy research, environment, applications and sustainable development
AB  - People rely upon oil for primary energy and this for a few more decades. Other orthodox sources may be more enduring, but are not without serious disadvantages. Power from natural resources has always had great appeal. Coal is plentiful, though there is concern about despoliation in winning it and pollution in burning it. Nuclear power has been developed with remarkable timeliness, but is not universally welcomed since construction of the plant is energy-intensive and there is concern about the disposal of its long-lived active wastes. Barrels of oil, lumps of coal, even uranium come from nature but the possibilities of almost limitless power from the atmosphere and the oceans seem to have special attraction. The wind machine provided an early way of developing motive power. The massive increases in fuel prices over the last years have however, made any scheme not requiring fuel appear to be more attractive and to be worth reinvestigation. In considering the atmosphere and the oceans as energy sources the four main contenders are solar energy, wind power, wave power, tidal and power from ocean thermal gradients. The renewable energy resources are particularly suited for the provision of rural power supplies and a major advantage is that equipment such as flat plate solar driers, wind machines, etc., can be constructed using local resources and without the advantage results from the feasibility of local maintenance and the general encouragement such local manufacture gives to the buildup of small-scale rural based industry. The present situation is best characterised as one of very rapid growth for wind and solar technologies and of significant promise for biomass and geothermal technologies. This chapter gives some examples of small-scale energy converters, nevertheless it should be noted that small conventional, i.e., engines are currently the major source of power in rural areas and will continue to be so for a long time to come. There is a need for some further development to suit local conditions, to minimise spares holdings, to maximise interchangeability both of engine parts and of the engine application. Emphasis should be placed on full local manufacture Â© 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Concept of long cruising range autonomous underwater vehicle powered by fuel cell
AB  - The use of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is now widespread among the underwater observation and survey. Because AUVs are not restricted by an umbilical cable, we think that AUVs have the most suitable form to collect ocean data or work depending on subjects of survey efficiently in the same way as the sea lives with various forms. For example, form to collect ocean data while cruising in a huge range, form to collect the topography data of the seafloor and under the bottom of the sea while cruising with following seafloor, form to work such as the collection of the rock of the seafloor or the setting of the sensor on the seafloor, form to collect ocean data slowly and carefully without moving the investigation spot against the current and so on. Underwater power source is one of very important elements to operate electrically driven underwater vehicles. Because there are no energy supply places in underwater. Many research and development about the underwater power source are carried out in all over the world. When the research and development of the power source, following things need to be considered: small and light weight, put in a pressure vessel or resist against water pressure, work against low water temperature, without vibration and noise, reliability and ease of maintenance. The power source has heaviest weight with the components of the underwater vehicles. The paper reported that concepts of the body design and model experimental results show specification of fuel cell system and several experimental results. Â© 2018 IEEE.

TI  - Extending the supply of alcohol fuels for energy security and carbon reduction
AB  - The paper critiques proposals for de-carbonizing transport and offers a potential solution which may be attained by the gradual evolution of the current fleet of predominantly low-cost vehicles via the development of carbon-neutral liquid fuels. The closed-carbon cycles which are possible using such fuels offer the prospect of maintaining current levels of mobility with affordable transport whilst neutralizing the threat posed by the high predicted growth of greenhouse gas emissions from this sector. Approaches to de-carbonizing transport include electrification and the adoption of molecular hydrogen as an energy carrier. These two solutions result in very expensive vehicles for personal transport which mostly lie idle for 95% of their life time and are purchased with high-cost capital. The total cost of ownership of such vehicles is high and the impact of such vehicles in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport is therefore likely to be low due to their unaffordability for a large number of customers. Conversely, powertrains and fuel systems capable of using renewable alcohols in high concentrations have minimal additional cost over existing models as they are made from abundant materials with low embedded energy levels. The use of ethanol and methanol in internal combustion engines is reviewed and it is found that the efficiency and performance of engines using these fuels exceeds that of their fossil fuel counterparts. Low-carbon-number alcohols and, where necessary, more energy-dense hydrocarbons can be supplied using feed stocks from the biosphere up to the biomass limit from biofuels and, beyond the biomass limit, from the atmosphere and oceans using captured CO 2 and hydrogen electrolysed from water. Using the hydrogen in a synthesized fuel rather than as an independent energy carrier can be thought of as a pragmatic implementation of the hydrogen economy. This avoids the extremely high infrastructure and distribution costs which accompany the use of molecular hydrogen. The production of liquid fuels from CO2 and water are reviewed in which fully-closed carbon cycles are theoretically possible with the development of large-scale renewable energy generation and CO2 capture from the atmosphere. An approach to the latter problem where CO 2 concentration and release based on bipolar membrane electrodialysis, developed by the co-authors from PARC, is described in detail and initial results from a laboratory scale device are reported. The development of a Tri-Flex-Fuel vehicle, capable of operating on any combination of gasoline, ethanol, and methanol, using a single fuel system is also described. The low additional technology and materials costs of such vehicles demonstrates that compatible, affordable transport can be developed which provides a feasible means of vehicle evolution towards decarbonized transport without the consequences of huge stranded assets which would be imposed on the automotive industry by the revolution which would be required to mass-produce hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and battery-electric vehicles.

TI  - Understanding Interaction Patterns within Deep-Sea Microbial Communities and Their Potential Applications
AB  - Environmental microbes living in communities engage in complex interspecies interactions that are challenging to decipher. Nevertheless, the interactions provide the basis for shaping community structure and functioning, which is crucial for ecosystem service. In addition, microbial interactions facilitate specific adaptation and ecological evolution processes particularly essential for microbial communities dwelling in resource-limiting habitats, such as the deep oceans. Recent technological and knowledge advancements provide an opportunity for the study of interactions within complex microbial communities, such as those inhabiting deep-sea waters and sediments. The microbial interaction studies provide insights into developing new strategies for biotechnical applications. For example, cooperative microbial interactions drive the degradation of complex organic matter such as chitins and celluloses. Such microbiologically-driven biogeochemical processes stimulate creative designs in many applied sciences. Understanding the interaction processes and mechanisms provides the basis for the development of synthetic communities and consequently the achievement of specific community functions. Microbial community engineering has many application potentials, including the production of novel antibiotics, biofuels, and other valuable chemicals and biomaterials. It can also be developed into biotechniques for waste processing and environmental contaminant bioremediation. This review summarizes our current understanding of the microbial interaction mechanisms and emerging techniques for inferring interactions in deep-sea microbial communities, aiding in future biotechnological and therapeutic applications.

TI  - Assessment of Bio-oil Extraction from Tetraselmis chui Microalgae Comparing Supercritical CO2, Solvent Extraction, and Thermal Processing
AB  - Microalgae have significant capacity to fix CO2 and to become a major industrial biomass resource. Examining ways to innovate the microalgae cultivation and processing value chain includes a focus on the most efficient and economical means to produce a liquid oil fraction from the microalgae species. This work compares the use of organic solvent, supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2), and pyrolysis to assess their relative capacity to derive oil from the marine microalgae Tetraselmis chui. The SC-CO2 technique was shown to be the least effective in natural oil extraction from T. chui. The results reveal that pure solvent extraction produces the most complete extraction of natural oil at just under 15\% by weight. Subsequent pyrolysis of the post-solvent extraction residue and examination of the byproduct suggest that extraction of natural lipids prior to thermal processing increases the total quantity of bio-oil yield production by more than 11\%.

TI  - Differential effects of biological invasions on coastal blue carbon: A global review and meta-analysis
AB  - Human-caused shifts in carbon (C) cycling and biotic exchange are defining characteristics of the Anthropocene. In marine systems, saltmarsh, seagrass, and mangrove habitatsâ€”collectively known as â€œblue carbonâ€ and coastal vegetated habitats (CVHs)â€”are a leading sequester of global C and increasingly impacted by exotic species invasions. There is growing interest in the effect of invasion by a diverse pool of exotic species on C storage and the implications for ecosystem-based management of these systems. In a global meta-analysis, we synthesized data from 104 papers that provided 345 comparisons of habitat-level response (plant and soil C storage) from paired invaded and uninvaded sites. We found an overall net effect of significantly higher C pools in invaded CVHs amounting to 40% (Â±16%) higher C storage than uninvaded habitat, but effects differed among types of invaders. Elevated C storage was driven by blue C-forming plant invaders (saltmarsh grasses, seagrasses, and mangrove trees) that intensify biomass per unit area, extend and elevate coastal wetlands, and convert coastal mudflats into C-rich vegetated habitat. Introduced animal and structurally distinct primary producers had significant negative effects on C pools, driven by herbivory, trampling, and native species displacement. The role of invasion manifested differently among habitat types, with significant C storage increases in saltmarshes, decreases in seagrass, and no significant effect in mangroves. There were also counter-directional effects by the same species in different systems or locations, which underscores the importance of combining data mining with analyses of mean effect sizes in meta-analyses. Our study provides a quantitative basis for understanding differential effects of invasion on blue C habitats and will inform conservation strategies that need to balance management decisions involving invasion, C storage, and a range of other marine biodiversity and habitat functions in these coastal systems.

TI  - Macro- and Micronutrient Cycling and Crucial Linkages to Geochemical Processes in Mangrove Ecosystems
AB  - High mangrove productivity is sustained by rapid utilization, high retention efficiency and maximum storage of nutrients in leaves, roots, and soils. Rapid microbial transformations and high mineralization efficiencies in tandem with physiological mechanisms conserve scarce nutrients. Macronutrient cycling is interlinked with micronutrient cycling; all nutrient cycles are linked closely to geochemical transformation processes. Mangroves can be N-, P-, Fe-, and Cu-limited; additions of Zn and Mo stimulate early growth until levels above pristine porewater concentrations induce toxicity. Limited nutrient availability is caused by sorption and retention onto iron oxides, clays, and sulfide minerals. Little N is exported as immobilization is the largest transformation process. Mn and S affect N metabolism and photosynthesis via early diagenesis and P availability is coupled to Fe-S redox oscillations. Fe is involved in nitrification, denitrification and anammox, and Mo is involved in NO3- reduction and N-2-fixation. Soil Mg, K, Mn, Zn and Ni pool sizes decrease as mangrove primary productivity increases, suggesting increasing uptake and more rapid turnover than in less productive forests. Mangroves may be major contributors to oceanic Mn and Mo cycles, delivering 7.4-12.1 Gmol Mn a(-1) to the ocean, which is greater than global riverine input. The global Mo import rate by mangroves corresponds to 15-120\% of Mo supply to the oceanic Mo budget.

TI  - Comparative study of performance and emissions of a CI engine using biodiesel of microalgae, macroalgae and rice bran
AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative and safe fuel to replace conventional petroleum diesel. With high-lubricity and clean-burning ability the biodiesel can be a better fuel component for use in existing diesel engines without any modifications. The aim of this Research was to study the potential use of Macro algae oil, Micro algae oil, Rice Bran oil methyl ester as a substitute for diesel fuel in diesel engine. B10 and B20 blends of these three types of fuels are prepared by transesterification process. The blends on volume basis were used to test them in a four stroke single cylinder diesel engine to study the performance and emission characteristics of these fuels and compared with neat diesel fuel. Also, the property testing of these biofuels were carried out. The biodiesel blends in this study substantially reduces the emission of unburnt hydro carbons and smoke opacity and increases the emission of NOx emission in exhaust gases. These biodiesel blends were consumed more by the engine during testing than Diesel and the brake thermal efficiency and volumetric efficiency for the blends was identical with the Diesel.

TI  - Design and performance evaluation of bionics-based combined blade for horizontal axis tidal current hydroturbine
AB  - Horizontal axis tidal current hydroturbines are widely used to extract tidal current energy. The blade is an important component of the hydroturbine, and its performance primarily depends on the airfoil pattern of the blade. Based on previous studies and elements of bionic technology, this study proposes a design method using bionic technology in the blade design to obtain a composite blade with NACA and shark airfoils and good hydrodynamic performance. An airfoil with a high lift-drag-ratio or a high torque coefficient is selected from multiple airfoil designs, and the optimal combination airfoil blade model is generated according to the blade element momentum theory and Wilson blade theory. The pressure and velocity fields of different combinations of the airfoil blades are investigated using numerical simulation and underwater experiments. The results demonstrate that the combined blade offers optimal performance when the pitch angle is 60Â°. Its torque coefficient and turbine speed are higher than those of conventional blades, and its energy coefficient is increased by approximately 14.5%. Â© 2022 Author(s).

TI  - Country-level potential of carbon sequestration and environmental benefits by utilizing crop residues for biochar implementation
AB  - Conversion of biomass into biofuel and biochar with a subsequent soil storage is assumed as a prospective strategy of reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. However, substantial uncertainties exist in this field regarding the country-level potential of biochar carbon sequestration, indirect effects of biochar implementation on overall environment, and dominating factors. This study conducted a life cycle assessment of country-wide incorporation of biochar in agriculture, and associated potential benefits. Results showed that over 920 kg CO2e (CO2-equivalent) could be sequestrated via converting 1 t of crop residues into biochar. As an example, based on crop residues availability statistics for China in 2014, the estimated annual carbon sequestration potential could be as high as 0.50 Pg CO2e (1 Pg = 1 Ã— 109 t). The most significant potential for biochar carbon sequestration was identified in the central south, east and northeast of China, which contributed 65% of the national biochar carbon sequestration potential. The biochar system could also contribute to mitigation of the following environmental problems: marine aquatic biodiversity destruction, surface soil and water acidification, etc. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that biochar yield, carbon content in biochar, electricity conversion efficiencies of bio-oil and pyrolysis gas were the critical parameters determining the biochar system's overall carbon sequestration potential and environmental effects. This study provides guidance on evaluating biochar's potential carbon sequestration capacity and comprehensive environmental impacts, as well as research and development needs. Â© 2020

TI  - Coastal zone geo-resources and geo-environment in China
AB  - The coastal zone of China is the economic development frontier with the highest population and urbanization, critically important for the national strategy of maritime power promotion, nevertheless it is also facing the highest pressures of resources shortage and environment challenges. This paper has reviewed the last two decades' survey and research results carried out by China Geological Survey in China's coastal zone, with the purpose of assessing the advantages of geo-resources and the challenges on geo-environment as well as geo-hazards. China's coastal zone possesses very rich geo-resources which provide the foundation of sustainable and green economy development. Here are some examples: 1.2 Ã— 104km2 tidal flat space resources can be used for future coastal spatial expansion to release the present high pressure of land resources; 2.8 Ã— 104 km2 high quality selenium-rich farming lands and 4.1Ã—105 km2 fishing grounds provide high potential capacity for green and special agriculture, fishery and marine ranching; shallow geothermal energy and geothermal water on the coastal zone can be converted into green energy equal to 4.2 Ã— 108 t standard coals, which will help to improve the energy consumption structure and reduce air pollution; 5.8 Ã— 104 km2 coastal wetlands and 134 sites of geo-heritage provide high potential opportunity for ecological civilization development on the coastal zone; 90% of the coastal land spaces are geologically suitable for urbanization development and infrastructure construction, with high quality and quantity underground space resources. Nevertheless, China's coastal zone is also facing serious challenges from geo-environment, such as active faults, land subsidence, surface collapse, coastal erosion and storm surge threats, pollution in water and soil, and salt water or brine water intrusion. These challenges should be taken into account for the coastal sustainable and ecological development. The authors suggest enhancing the coastal multidisciplinary and comprehensive geological survey, establishing the integrated coastal geological models based on multiple environmental factors, geosphere-biosphere-hydrosphere interactive layers as well as multiple spatial and temporal dimensions, and revealing the distribution and causes of geohazards so as to mitigate the life and wealth losses on the coastal zone.

TI  - The renewable energy revolution of reunion island
AB  - Reunion Island, a French overseas region located in the Indian Ocean, is facing a three-fold challenge combining demographics, the environment and energy. To limit its heavy dependence on imported fossil fuels, Reunion Island aims to achieve energy autonomy by 2030 based on greater energy efficiency and renewable energy alternatives. The objective of this study is to analyze different scenarios to reach electricity autonomy and, at the same time, consider the wide-scale integration of renewable energy in the island's power system using the bottom-up optimization energy model TIMES-Reunion. Despite the tremendous potential of renewable energy sources present on the island, the transition to 100\% renewable energy needs to be supported by incentives or constraints. Strong energy policies can both direct the choice of renewable resources and accelerate the renewable transition. The development of biomass on Reunion Island is economically interesting. The transition scenarios show that by 2030, electricity from biomass advantageously replaces electricity from coal and represents slightly more than 50\% of electricity generation. Solar and wave/ocean energies are not the most cost effective option, but wind energy tends to disappear in the face of these energies more politically supported. A network regulation rule benefits biomass and is more detrimental to solar than to wave energy. The decarbonized transition of the power system incurs higher total discounted system costs due to the additional costs induced by the different incentives to promote certain renewables, with some pathways toward energy autonomy appearing more costly than others.

TI  - Valorisation to biogas of macroalgal waste streams: a circular approach to bioproducts and bioenergy in Ireland
AB  - Seaweeds (macroalgae) have been recently attracting more and more interest as a third generation feedstock for bioenergy and biofuels. However, several barriers impede the deployment of competitive seaweed-based energy. The high cost associated to seaweed farming and harvesting, as well as their seasonal availability and biochemical composition currently make macroalgae exploitation too expensive for energy production only. Recent studies have indicated a possible solution to aforementioned challenges may lay in seaweed integrated biorefinery, in which a bioenergy and/or biofuel production step ends an extractions cascade of high-value bioproducts. This results in the double benefit of producing renewable energy while adopting a zero waste approach, as fostered by recent EU societal challenges within the context of the Circular Economy development. This study investigates the biogas potential of residues from six indigenous Irish seaweed species while discussing related issues experienced during fermentation. It was found that Laminaria and Fucus spp. are the most promising seaweed species for biogas production following biorefinery extractions producing 187-195 mL CH4 gVS(-1) and about 100 mL CH4 gVS(-1) , respectively, exhibiting overall actual yields close to raw un-extracted seaweed.

TI  - L-Rhamnose Metabolism in Clostridium beijerinckii Strain DSM 6423
AB  - Macroalgae (or seaweeds) are considered potential biomass feedstocks for the production of renewable fuels and chemicals. Their sugar composition is different from that of lignocellulosic biomasses, and in green species, including Ulva lactuca, the major sugars are L-rhamnose and o-glucose. C. beijerinckii DSM 6423 utilized these sugars in a U. lactuca hydrolysate to produce acetic acid, butyric acid, isopropanol, butanol, and ethanol (IBE), and 1,2-propanediol. D-Glucose was almost completely consumed in diluted hydrolysates, while L-rhamnose or D-xylose was only partially utilized. In this study, the metabolism of L-rhamnose by C. beijerinckii DSM 6423 was investigated to improve its utilization from natural resources. Fermentations on D-glucose, L-rhamnose, and a mixture of D-glucose and L-rhamnose were performed. On L-rhamnose, the cultures showed low growth and sugar consumption and produced 1,2-propanediol, propionic acid, and n-propanol in addition to acetic and butyric acids, whereas on D-glucose, IBE was the major product. On a D-glucose- L-rhamnose mixture, both sugars were converted simultaneously and L-rhamnose consumption was higher, leading to high levels of 1,2-propanediol (78.4 mM), in addition to 59.4 mM butanol and 31.9 mM isopropanol. Genome and transcriptomics analysis of D-glucose- and L-rhamnose-grown cells revealed the presence and transcription of genes involved in L-rhamnose utilization and in bacterial microcompartment (BMC) formation. These data provide useful insights into the metabolic pathways involved in L-rhamnose utilization and the effects on the general metabolism (glycolysis, early sporulation, and stress response) induced by growth on L-rhamnose. IMPORTANCE A prerequisite for a successful biobased economy is the efficient conversion of biomass resources into useful products, such as biofuels and bulk and specialty chemicals. In contrast to other industrial microorganisms, natural solvent-producing clostridia utilize a wide range of sugars, including C-5, C-6, and deoxy-sugars, for production of long-chain alcohols (butanol and 2,3-butanediol), isopropanol, acetone, n-propanol, and organic acids. Butanol production by clostridia from first-generation sugars is already a commercial process, but for the expansion and diversification of the acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE)/IBE process to other substrates, more knowledge is needed on the regulation and physiology of fermentation of sugar mixtures. Green macroalgae, produced in aquaculture systems, harvested from the sea or from tides, can be processed into hydrolysates containing mixtures of D-glucose and L-rhamnose, which can be fermented. The knowledge generated in this study will contribute to the development of more efficient processes for macroalga fermentation and of mixed-sugar fermentation in general.

TI  - Alternative fuel options for low carbon maritime transportation: Pathways to 2050
AB  - Within the context of achieving low carbon shipping by 2050, high hopes are placed on alternative marine fuels in addition to a large number of technological and operational measures. A technological review has been carried out in this paper to determine the most promising alternative marine fuels considering the simultaneous reduction of sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide emissions as well as sustainability. Firstly, potential alternative marine fuel options have been summarized based on a review of published literature. Then, key physicochemical properties, feedstocks, production processes, transportation and storage factors, and end uses of zero carbon or carbon-neutral fuels have been analyzed. Finally, a qualitative ranking of the potential of different marine fuel options is presented based on a multi-dimensional decision-making framework. It was found that zero carbon synthetic fuels including hydrogen and ammonia accompanied by clean production could play a vital role in domestic and short sea shipping, though current costs and infrastructure are not commercially feasible. Methanol (fossil/renewable) appears likely to be the most promising alternative fuel for global shipping instead of other carbon-neutral biofuels such as renewable natural gas, bioethanol, biogenic dimethyl ether and biodiesels, which may be feasible for domestic and short sea shipping depending on local practices. It should be highlighted that marine fuel substitution is a prolonged process. Accordingly, consensus building and action-adopting in the maritime community as early as possible is important to anchor expectations and achieve the goals of clean maritime transportation.

TI  - The emergy ecological footprint for small fish farm in China
AB  - Mariculture, especially cage aquaculture remains a growing, vibrant and important production sector for high protein food in coastal regions in China. A quantitative evaluation of the mariculture system is an essential step to documenting its' sustainability. The method of emergy ecological footprint is applied to evaluate the environmental sustainability of an offshore small fish farm (Great Marine fish farm, GMFF) in the East China Sea. All input needed to support fish farming were accounted and converted into biological space, to estimate the natural capital demand for the rearing process in terms of global hectares. The emergy ecological footprint of GMFF was 1953.19 ha, meaning that nearly 2000 ha of ecologically productive lands were needed to support the fish framing. The largest component of emergy ecological footprint was forage (1183.64 ha), which took up 60.60\% of the total footprint; the second and third largest footprint components were fingerlings and fuel. In a word, emergy ecological footprint can serve as a practical and meaningful tool for comparing and monitoring the environmental impact of fish farming. The strong dependence of external contributions of exploiting the wild fish resources affects strongly the level of environmental sustainability of fish farming. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Renewable energy in India: Current status and future potentials
AB  - Renewable energy sources and technologies have potential to provide solutions to the long-standing energy problems being faced by the developing countries. The renewable energy sources like wind energy, solar energy, geothermal energy, ocean energy, biomass energy and fuel cell technology can be used to overcome energy shortage in India. To meet the energy requirement for such a fast growing economy, India will require an assured supply of 3-4 times more energy than the total energy consumed today. The renewable energy is one of the options to meet this requirement. Today, renewable account for about 33% of India's primary energy consumptions. India is increasingly adopting responsible renewable energy techniques and taking positive steps towards carbon emissions, cleaning the air and ensuring a more sustainable future. In India, from the last two and half decades there has been a vigorous pursuit of activities relating to research, development, demonstration, production and application of a variety of renewable energy technologies for use in different sectors. In this paper, efforts have been made to summarize the availability, current status, major achievements and future potentials of renewable energy options in India. This paper also assesses specific policy interventions for overcoming the barriers and enhancing deployment of renewables for the future. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Is the use of renewable energy sources an answer to the problems of global warming and pollution?
AB  - It has always been a widely prevalent belief that renewable energy sources are clean and green in contrast to nonrenewable fossil fuels. The oil price shocks of 1973 and 1979, alongside increasing global awareness towards environmental pollution had stimulated great interest in the development of renewable energy sources during the early 1980s. But as the oil prices came down and few breakthroughs were achieved in that period for making the cost of renewable energy comparable or lesser to fossil fuel energy, the enthusiasm of the early 1980s began to wane. In more recent years the spectres of global warming and ocean acidification, which have been primarily attributed to fossil fuel burning, has caused a resurgence of interest in renewable energy sources. As illustrated in this article, scientists from all over the world are strongly advocating large-scale substitution of conventional energy sources with renewable alternatives on the premise that such a move would substantially reduce environmental degradation and global warming. These sentiments are being echoed by policy makers as well as environmental activists. The authors examine the scenarios when different renewable energy technologies may be pressed into service to either produce power in large-scale centralized systems or be used widely in small-scale and dispersed fashion (instead of the rarely large-scale and mostly sporadic manner of their use at present). They discuss that there are likely to be impacts as strongly adverse as global warming and others experienced with fossil fuel use. The purpose of this exercise is not to make a case against renewable resources, but rather to report on a much more realistic and elaborate assessment of the direct and indirect impacts of extensive utilization of renewable energy technologies than has been done hitherto, which will help the cause of renewable resources in the long run. It would help us in preventing most of the likely problems from taking root. In addition, it will spare the world from the type of disillusionment it faces vis a vis large hydel power projects, which werebefore their widespread useperceived as the epitome of virtue.

TI  - Evaluation of Three Marine Algae on Degradability, In Vitro Gas Production, and CH4 and CO2 Emissions by Ruminants
AB  - Livestock production systems are responsible for producing -18\% of the total anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Numerous alternatives, such as feed additives or supplements, have been proposed to meet these challenges. Marine algae have been proposed for gas reduction in ruminants; nevertheless, there are still very few experimental reports. Thus, the objective of the current study was to identify the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in three marine algae-Kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), Ulva (Ulva spp.), and Silk (Mazzaella spp.)-and to test their in vitro ruminal fermentation characteristics, gas profiles, and ability to mitigate biogas production. The evaluation of the VOCs in marine algae was performed using a flash gas chromatography electronic nose (FGC-E-Nose). The in vitro study was elaborated through in vitro incubation and gas production. The data obtained were analyzed using a completely randomized design. In total, forty-three volatile compounds were identified for Kelp algae, thirty-eight were identified for Ulva algae, and thirty-six were identified for Silk algae; the compounds were from different chemical families and included aromas, alcohols, aldehydes, phenolics, carboxylic acids, esters, and nutraceutical properties. Dry matter degradability was significantly (p < 0.05) affected by the algae type. The cumulative ruminal gas production was different (p < 0.05) between treatments. Kelp algae presented a major (V; p < 0.05) volume of gas produced compared to the other algae. Lag time (1; p < 0.05) was increased by Kelp alga; however, there were no differences (p>0.05) between the Silk and Ulva algae. The gas production rate was higher (s; p < 0.05) for Silk algae compared to the others. Ulva and Silk algae demonstrated a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in carbon dioxide emissions. Nevertheless, Kelp algae reduced the proportional methane (CH4) production (p < 0.05) after 48 h of incubation, with the lowest emission rate of 47.73\%. In conclusion, algae have numerous bio compounds that provide some properties for use in ruminant diets as additives to reduce methane and carbon dioxide emissions.

TI  - Inferring time-variable effects of nutrient enrichment on marine ecosystems using inverse modelling and ecological network analysis
AB  - We combined data from an outdoor mesocosm experiment with carbon budget modelling and an ecological network analysis to assess the effects of continuous nutrient additions on the structural and functional dynamics of a marine planktonic ecosystem. The food web receiving no nutrient additions was fuelled by detritus, as zooplankton consumed 7.2 times more detritus than they consumed algae. Nutrient supply instantly promoted herbivory so that it was comparable to detritivory at the highest nutrient addition rate. Nutrient-induced food web restructuring reduced carbon cycling and decreased the average number of compartments a unit flow of carbon crosses before dissipation. Also, the efficiency of copepod production, the link to higher trophic levels harvestable by man, was lowered up to 35 times by nutrient addition, but showed signs of recovery after 9 to 11. days. The dependency of the food web on exogenous input was not changed by the nutrient additions. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Marine microalgal culturing in open pond systems for biodiesel production-Critical parameters
AB  - In the present scenario, petroleum sourced fuel consumption is unsustainable; therefore, there is a high demand for the development of renewable transport fuels for environmental and economic sustainability. Microalgal fuel, with the significant feature of being carbon neutral, serves as one of the potent tools for tackling the fuel crisis. Enormous researches have been explored using fresh water species on biodiesel production; nevertheless, marine species are still in a grey area, even though reported to have higher lipid content. The current review focuses on a wide spectrum of marine microalgal sources with phycology under the criteria of open pond systems for algal oil production. The discussion on the lipid expression in the marine species have been critically analysed through the vital parameters such as solar irradiation, temperature, pH, nutrient pressure, agitation, CO2 supply, culture depth, aeration, etc. The parameters are interdependent and, if scrutinized wisely, could result in enhanced lipid productivity. Therefore, the open pond culture of marine microalgae with top prioritized parameters such as nitrogen stress, pH, and light penetration will be a suitable combination for the efficient and effective biodiesel production.

TI  - A validation and comparison study of new, compact, versatile optodes for oxygen, pH and carbon dioxide in marine environments
AB  - Continuous monitoring of dissolved oxygen, pH and carbon dioxide are of great importance in oceanography. Sensors are the optimal tools for in situ measurements from mobile platforms, like Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) or Argo profiling floats, and for shipboard deployments. A validation study of small, versatile, easy-to-use, stand-alone optodes is presented. Each analyte can be read out with the identical optoelectronics which greatly minimizes the costs of the hardware needed. Several deployments were performed to evaluate the applicability of the sensors. The deployments varied in terms of duration (profiling, long-term monitoring 5 days to 8 weeks) and environmental conditions (salinity: 6-33 PSS; temperature: 9-25 degrees C). A set of sensors was successfully deployed at a mooring buoy, in an aquaculture facility and in the Monterey Bay Aquarium Open Sea Exhibition. They were also integrated in an AUV and a profiling float. The performance of the optodes was evaluated in comparison with commercially available sensors for dissolved oxygen (Aanderaa Data Instruments AS, Sea-Bird Scientific, OxyGuarda), pH (Hach, Satlantic) and carbon dioxide (Turner design). The data collected by our optodes and the commercially available sensors is generally in good agreement showing that the new, compact sensor device in combination with sensor foils (pO(2), pH, pCO(2)) can be a valuable tool for many applications in oceanography. The data also revealed the importance of the calibration strategy since inappropriate calibration resulted in an offset in the measured parameter. The efficiency of simple biofouling protection strategy (copper guard) for prolong measurements in highly dynamic environments was also demonstrated.

TI  - Low-ILUC biofuel production in marginal areas: Can existing EU policies support biochar deployment in EU MED arid lands under desertification?
AB  - Arid lands in EU MED areas are increasing in extension year by year, as it is well documented by many studies of International Institutions (as EC-JRC, EEA, etc). EU MED farmers face the dramatic effects of extended drought conditions, that combined with extreme phenomena as floodings or thunderstorms make economic profitability of agriculture very low or even negative. This is associated with a clearly increasing abandonment rate of agricultural land in EU. The most EU critical areas are located in Spain, but also Greece, Italy and Portugal, as well as in the non-EU Southern rim of the MED basin. Biochar could represent an effective approach to fight desertification, together with other agronomic practices which can vary depending on the specific location or crops. Biochar can be cheaply produced from residual biomass through processes such as slow pyrolysis or hydrothermal carbonization, and its combination with compost obtained from the Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (OFMSW) or digestate from anaerobic digestion can offer both a short and a medium-to-long term effect in dryland agriculture. These lands, that otherwise would inevitably leave the active utilisation in conventional agriculture, would be suitable for energy crop cultivation, as drought resistant oil crop, well meeting the latest indications in the EC REDII proposal. Through biochar (and derived product) application, the loss of Utilised Agricultural Land in EU MED drylands can be prevented. From the policy side, it thus makes sense to investigate if existing policies are sufficient to facilitate the wide market deployment of biochar, or if new instruments are needed. Our analysis demonstrates that currently operational EU policies, could be well used to implement biochar related actions in arid lands. However, most often these measures are not transferred into concrete programmes at regional level, especially in the agricultural sector. In fact, EU and Member States already have quite a large number of instruments that can directly or indirectly support actions targeted to increase the resilience of these arid lands to Climate Change, generating a significant impact on the environmental and socio-economic situation. Policy should support initiatives that can provide clear evidences, be cost- and environmentally-effective, and adapted to local conditions. The present work investigated EU/MS policies that could potentially support the improvement of soil resilience to climate change in EU MED region, by enabling widespread diffusion of biochar. The EU legislative elements that were considered are the EU agricultural policy, the EU Carbon sequestration & storage policy (seen in the framework of the COP21 agreement and its core goals), and the EU renewable energy policy, even if others would also apply. We considered sunflower cultivation in dry land of Central area (Tuscany) of Italy. Results showed that marginal land could be seen as an opportunity to produce low-ILUC biofuels (as mentioned in the EC REDII proposed Directive), without conflicting with food production or generating negative effects on GHG emissions. The Long-term storage of C in the soil through biochar would perfectly match with the Climate strategy defined at International level (Paris COP21 and following). Soil, after ocean, is the second most abundant C sink: Paris-COP21 called for C-negative actions (and not just C-neutral ones). In this respect, the proposed approach would perfectly match with EU (ETS) and International (COP21) policy for the coming decades. Copyright Â© 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

TI  - The ecology of infrastructure decommissioning in the North Sea: what we need to know and how to achieve it
AB  - As decommissioning of oil and gas (O\&G) installations intensifies in the North Sea, and worldwide, debate rages regarding the fate of these novel habitats and their associated biota-a debate that has important implications for future decommissioning of offshore wind farms (OWFs). Calls to relax complete removal requirements in some circumstances and allow part of an O\&G installation to be left in the marine environment are increasing. Yet knowledge regarding the biological communities that develop on these structures and their ecological role in the North Sea is currently insufficient to inform such decommissioning decisions. To focus debate regarding decommissioning policy and guide ecological research, we review environmental policy objectives in the region, summarize existing knowledge regarding ecological aspects of decommissioning for both O\&G and OWF installations, and identify approaches to address knowledge gaps through science-industry collaboration. We find that in some cases complete removal will conflict with other policies regarding protection and restoration of reefs, as well as the conservation of species within the region. Key ecological considerations that are rarely considered during decommissioning decisions are: (i) provision of reef habitat, (ii) productivity of offshore ecosystems, (iii) enhancement of biodiversity, (iv) protection of the seabed from trawling, and (v) enhancement of connectivity. Knowledge gaps within these areas will best be addressed using industry infrastructure and vessels for scientific investigations, re-analysis of historical data held by industry, scientific training of industry personnel, joint research funding opportunities, and trial decommissioning projects.

TI  - Similar diversity-disturbance responses to different physical impacts: Three cases of small-scale biodiversity increase in the Belgian part of the North Sea
AB  - Human activities at sea are still increasing. As biodiversity is a central topic in the management of our seas, it is important to understand how diversity responds to different disturbances related with physical impacts. We investigated the effects of three impacts, i.e. sand extraction, dredge disposal and offshore wind energy exploitation, on the soft-bottom macrobenthic assemblages in the Belgian part of the North Sea. We found similar diversity-disturbance responses, mainly related to the fact that different impacts caused similar environmental changes. We observed a sediment refinement which triggered a shift towards a heterogenic, dynamic (transitional) soft-bottom macrobenthic assemblage, with several species typically associated with muddy sands. This led to a local unexpected biodiversity increase in the impacted area. On a wider regional scale, the ever increasing human impacts might lead to a homogenization of the sediment, resulting in a more uniform, yet less diverse benthic ecosystem. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Various carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies were established to mitigate this impending issue. CO2 adsorption is gaining prominence since unlike traditional chemical absorption, it does not require high energy usage for solvent regeneration and consumption of corrosive chemical solvent. In CO2 adsorption, activated carbons show high CO2 adsorption capacity given their well-developed porous structures. Numerous researches employed oil palm wastes as low-cost precursors. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of research works available thus far in oil palm-derived activated carbon (OPdAC) for CO2 adsorption application. First, we present the desired OPdAC characteristics and its precursors in terms of their chemical properties, elemental, and proximate compositions. This is followed by an overview of various activation methodologies and surface modification methods to attain the desired characteristics for CO2 adsorption. Then the focus turned to present available OPdAC CO2 adsorption performance and how it is affected by its physical and chemical characteristics. Based on these, we identify the challenges and the potential development in different aspects such as precursor selection, process development, and optimization of parameter. A pilot scale production cost analysis is also presented to compare various activation and surface modification methods, so that the appropriate method can be selected for CO2 adsorption.

TI  - Interaction of wave-induced motion and bioelectricity generation for floating microalgal biophotovoltaic system
AB  - Biophotovoltaic (BPV) system is a developing photo-bio-electrochemical technology that harnesses solar light for power generation. However, a large scale BPV farm is needed for megawatts application, which may not be economically viable as an onshore facility. Therefore, a floating BPV can be an alternative option whereby the spacious offshore area can be utilized; nonetheless, the liquid inside a floating BPV is inevitable to be affected by the ocean wave motions. Hence, the interaction effects of wave motions and power generation of floating BPV device is a crucial decision-making factor to migrate BPV from onshore to offshore area. In this study, a scaled model experiment was conducted to compare the difference in power output between static and floating BPV devices. The findings are expected to provide better understanding on the correlation of these parameters in the implementation of a floating solution for BPV.

TI  - Using Alternative Sources of Energy for Decarbonization: A Piece of Cake, but How to Cook This Cake?
AB  - Few analytical or research works claim that the negative impact of improper use of ASEs may be comparable with that of hydrocarbons and sometimes even greater. It has become a common view that â€œgreenâ€ energy (ASE) is clean, safe and environmentally friendly (eco-friendly) in contrast with â€œblackâ€ energy (hydrocarbons). We analyzed 144 works on systemic and/or comparative research of the modern and prospective ASE: biofuels, hydrogen, hydropower, nuclear power, wind power, solar power, geothermal power, oceanic thermal power, tidal power, wind wave power and nuclear fusion power. We performed our analysis within the Spaceship Earth paradigm. We conclude that there is no perfect ASE that is always eco-friendly. All ASEs may be dangerous to the planet considered as a closed and isolated unit (â€œspaceshipâ€) if they are used in an inconsistent manner. This is not in the least a reason to deny them as prospective sources of energy. Using all ASEs in different proportions in various regions of the planet, where their harm to the planet and humanity can be minimized and, on the contrary, their efficiency maximized, would give humanity the opportunity to decarbonize the Earth, and make the energy transition in the most effective way.

TI  - Building industries at sea: 'Blue Growth' and the new maritime economy
AB  - Throughout the world there is evidence of mounting interest in marine resources and new maritime industries to create jobs, economic growth and to help in the provision of energy and food security. Expanding populations, insecurity of traditional sources of supply and the effects of climate change add urgency to a perceived need to address and overcome the serious challenges of working in the maritime environment. Four promising areas of activity for 'Blue Growth' have been identified at European Union policy level including Aquaculture; Renewable Energy (offshore wind, wave and tide); Seabed Mining; and Blue Biotechnology. Work has started to raise the technological and investment readiness levels (TRLs and IRLs) of these prospective industries drawing on the experience of established maritime industries such as Offshore Oil and Gas; Shipping; Fisheries and Tourism. An accord has to be struck between policy makers and regulators on the one hand, anxious to direct research and business incentives in effective and efficient directions, and developers, investors and businesses on the other, anxious to reduce the risks of such potentially profitable but innovative investments. The EU H2020 MARIBE (Marine Investment for the Blue Economy) funded project was designed to identify the key technical and non-technical challenges facing maritime industries and to place them into the social and economic context of the coastal and ocean economy. MARIBE went on to examine with companies, real projects for the combination of marine industry sectors into multi-use platforms (MUPs). The purpose of this book is to publish the detailed analysis of each prospective and established maritime business sector. Sector experts working to a common template explain what these industries are, how they work, their prospects to create wealth and employment, and where they currently stand in terms of innovation, trends and their lifecycle. The book goes on to describe progress with the changing regulatory and planning regimes in the European Sea Basins including the Caribbean where there are significant European interests. The book includes: Experienced chapter authors from a truly multidisciplinary team of sector specialisms First extensive study to compare and contrast traditional Blue Economy with Blue Growth Complementary to EU and National policies for multi-use of maritime space.

TI  - Assessing the impact of elevated pCO2 within and across generations in a highly invasive fouling mussel (Musculista senhousia)
AB  - Marine biofouling by the swiftly spreading invasive mussel (Musculista senhousia) has caused serious ecological and economic consequences in the global coastal waters. However, the fate of this highly invasive fouling species in a rapidly acidifying ocean remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated the impacts of ocean acidification within and across generations, to understand whether M. senhousia has the capacity to acclimate to changing ocean conditions. During the gonadal development, exposure of mussels to elevated pCO2 caused significant decreases of survival, growth performance and condition index, and shifted the whole-organism energy budget by inflating energy expenses to fuel compensatory processes, eventually impairing the success of spawning. Yet, rapid transgenerational acclimation occurred during the early life history stage and persisted into adulthood. Eggs spawned from CO2-exposed mussels were significantly bigger compared with those from non-CO2-exposed mussels, indicating increased maternal provisioning into eggs and hence conferring larvae resilience under harsh conditions. Larvae with a prior history of transgenerational exposure to elevated pCO2 developed faster and had a higher survival than those with no prior history of CO2 exposure. Transgenerational exposure significantly increased the number of larvae completing metamorphosis. While significant differences in shell growth were no longer observed during juvenile nursery and adult grow-out, transgenerationally exposed mussels displayed improved survival in comparison to non-transgenerationally exposed mussels. Metabolic plasticity arose following transgenerational acclimation, generating more energy available for fitness-related functions. Overall, the present study demonstrates the remarkable ability of M. senhousia to respond plastically and acclimate rapidly to changing ocean conditions. Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Algae - A quintessential and positive resource of bioethanol production: A comprehensive review
AB  - Alternate renewable energy has created a tremendous place for itself in today's scenario of energy studies. Depleting fossil fuels and high environmental pollution leading to threatening climatic changes have led to the search of alternative energy systems. Fuels derived from biological sources, the third generation biofuels - biodiesel, biohydrogen and bioethanol are being explored by researchers and scientists extensively and renewable fuel yielding biomass is now a center of attention. Algae, one such biomass, are unique biological sources with distinctive characters to produce biofuel. They are highly adaptable and can grow in all types of land and water, yielding high content of lipids or carbohydrates. Bioethanol is a biofuel reducing green house gases, carbon-di-oxide emissions and global warming, yet research have been carried out to standardize its potentialities and commercialization. This review throws limelight on potentially utilizing macroalgae for producing bioethanol and application of nano technology for extracting carbohydrates for bioethanol production.

TI  - Use of Response Surface Methodology in optimization of biomass, lipid productivity and fatty acid profiles of marine microalga Dunaliella parva for biodiesel production
AB  - In order to reduce fossil fuel consumption, renewable energy sources such as algal biomass have attracted more interest for the production of biodiesel as an energy source. In the current study, marine microalga Dunaliella parva was mainly assessed for higher biomass productivity, lipid content and productivity by the optimization of growth medium with Response Surface Methodology (RSM) for production of biodiesel. Other biochemical compounds such as carbohydrates, proteins and free amino acids content and productivity were also evaluated by RSM. Maximum biomass productivity, lipid content and productivity (48.59 mg/L/day, 39.08 \% and 19.91 mg/L/day, respectively) was attained by RSM optimized medium containing 0.63 g/L nitrogen, 0.02 g/L phosphorus and 1.61 M NaCl, which are 1.2, 1.5 and 1.4 folds, respectively, higher than normal growth medium and agreed well with the predicted value (49.85 mg/L/day, 37.51 \% and 19.49 mg/L/day). In addition, saturated fatty acids increased from 42.8 \% to 59.7\%, polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased from 54.9\% to 40.3\% and the biodiesel properties almost complied with international standards, ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 under optimized conditions. Thus, D. parva has potential as an alternative source for the biodiesel production of excellent quality. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Energy-Aware Multiflight Planning for an Unattended Seaplane: Flying fish
AB  - Long-term unmanned vehicle operation requires autonomy capable of replanning activities responsive to changing vehicle and environment conditions. For unmanned aircraft systems, human handlers perform refueling/recharge and maintenance activities between flights, so the period of autonomy is typically limited to one flight. This paper investigates flight planning for a solar-energy-harvesting seaplane designed for persistent ocean surveillance without the need for human handling over a potentially long-term mission. A multiflight planner is introduced to generate energy-aware plans for persistent ocean surveillance.Anovel heuristic is proposed to solve an asymmetric, nonmetric, negative-cost traveling salesman problem. Heuristic admissibility is demonstrated under specific conditions, and the characteristics of optimal multiflight plans are analyzed over a series of surveillance missions.

TI  - How phosphorus limitation can control climate-active gas sources and sinks
AB  - Since the 1950's, anthropogenic activities have increased nutrient river loads to European coastal areas. Subsequent implementation of nutrient reduction policies have led to considerably reduction of phosphorus (P) loads from the mid-1980's, while nitrogen (N) loads were maintained, inducing a P limitation of phytoplankton growth in many eutrophied coastal areas such as the Southern Bight of the North Sea (SBNS). When dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) is limiting, most phytoplankton organisms are able to indirectly acquire P from dissolved organic P (DOP). We investigate the impact of DOP use on phytoplankton production and atmospheric fluxes of CO2 and dimethylsulfide (DMS) in the SBNS from 1951 to 2007 using an extended version of the R-MIRO-BIOGAS model. This model includes a description of the ability of phytoplankton organisms to use DOP as a source of P. Results show that primary production can increase up to 30% due to DOP uptake under limiting DIP conditions. Consequently, simulated DMS emissions also increase proportionally while CO2 emissions to the atmosphere decrease, relative to the reference simulation without DOP uptake. Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A close-loop integrated approach for microalgae cultivation and efficient utilization of agar-free seaweed residues for enhanced biofuel recovery
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate a novel integrated biorefinery route for enhanced energy recovery from seaweeds and microalgae. Agar extraction prior to anaerobic digestion recorded the highest biogas productivity of 32.57 L kg(-1) VS d(-1). Supplementation of the microalgal growth medium with anaerobic digestate from agar-extracted biomass enhanced the microalgal growth, recording the highest dry weight of 4.57 g L-1 at 20\% digestate ratio. In addition, lipid content showed the highest value of 25.8 \%dw. Due to enhancement of growth and lipid content, 20\% digestate ratio showed the highest lipid productivity and FAMEs recovery (65.2 mg L-1 d(-1) and 123.3 mg g(-1)dw, respectively), with enhanced biodiesel characteristics. The present study estimated annual revenue of 1252.7 US\$ ton(-1) from the whole Gracilaria multipartita biomass conversion into biogas, while that through agar extraction deserved 36087.0 US\$ ton(-1), with enhanced annual biodiesel yield by 69.7\% over the control medium.

TI  - PM and PAHs emissions of ship auxiliary engine fuelled with waste cooking oil biodiesel and marine gas oil
AB  - Clean fuels are recommended for ships at berth to reduce air pollutant emissions. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of waste cooking oil (WCO) biodiesel application on board with regard to particle matter (PM) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emissions. An experiment was conducted on a marine auxiliary engine for three different fuels: WCO biodiesel, formulation blends with marine gas oil (MGO) and neat MGO. Results revealed that WCO biodiesel could reduce PM and PAHs emissions. WCO exhaust also exhibited differences in PAH profile and phase distribution as compared to MGO, depending on the operation modes and the proportion of biodiesel in the formulation blends. Consequently, WCO biodiesel could dramatically reduce the total carcinogenic potencies related to PAHs of exhausts. Moreover, PAH source recognition pair ratios of tested fuels were observed to deviate from the widely accepted values. This study highlights that WCO biodiesel is a cleaner fuel for operating ship auxiliary engines with respect to PM and PAHs emissions and has the potential to moderate the severe effects of PM and PAHs on an air of coastal areas.

Their value and significance to the US economy is considered, and environmental concerns and their resolution are discussed. Future ocean resource developments briefly outlined include the exploitation of energy in the form of wave, tides, temperature difference, and gas hydrate deposits. At present, offshore oil and gas are the most valuable offshore resources in the United States. The numbers are expected to increase as land production declines, offshore production increases, and new sources are discovered offshore. This is not the case for minerals.

TI  - Energy efficient dewatering of far offshore grown green macroalgae Ulva sp. biomass with pulsed electric fields and mechanical press
AB  - Offshore macroalgae biomass production is a promising, yet challenging, pathway to provide feedstock for biorefineries. In this work, a device and a process for dewatering offshore grown biomass of the green macroalgae Ulva sp. using high-voltage pulsed electric fields (PEF) was developed. Ulva sp. was cultivated attached to fish cages 15 km offshore. Increasing the applied voltage from 250 V to 500 V and invested PEF energy from 9.3 Â± 0.4 J gâˆ’1 FW to 54.6 Â± 0.2Jgâˆ’1 FW increased the extracted water from 0.033 Â± 0.006 g Water gâˆ’1 FW to 0.150 Â± 0.031 g Water gâˆ’1 FW. The energy consumption to achieve similar moisture content with air convection drying was lower by 78.73 Â± 10.41 (JgFWâˆ’1) for 250 V and 339.31 Â± 48.01 (JgFWâˆ’1) for 500 V, pulse duration 50 Âµs, pulse number 50, pulse repetition frequency 3 Hz. PEF leads to biomass compression of 8.45 Â± 1.72% for 250 V protocol and 25.66 Â± 2.53% for 500 V protocol. In addition, PEF leads to the reduction of water diffusivity of 18â€“19% in the treated biomass, reducing air drying kinetics. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Carbon content, carbon fixation yield and dissolved organic carbon release from diverse marine nitrifiers
AB  - Nitrifying microorganisms, including ammonia-oxidizing archaea, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, are the most abundant chemoautotrophs in the ocean and play an important role in the global carbon cycle by fixing dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) into biomass. The release of organic compounds by these microbes is not well quantified, but may represent an as-yet unaccounted source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) available to marine food webs. Here, we provide measurements of cellular carbon and nitrogen quotas, DIC fixation yields and DOC release of 10 phylogenetically diverse marine nitrifiers. All investigated strains released DOC during growth, representing on average 5â€“15% of the fixed DIC. Changes in substrate concentration and temperature did not affect the proportion of fixed DIC released as DOC, but release rates varied between closely related species. Our results also indicate previous studies may have underestimated DIC fixation yields of marine nitrite oxidizers due to partial decoupling of nitrite oxidation from CO2 fixation, and due to lower observed yields in artificial compared to natural seawater medium. The results of this study provide critical values for biogeochemical models of the global carbon cycle, and help to further constrain the implications of nitrification-fueled chemoautotrophy for marine food-web functioning and the biological sequestration of carbon in the ocean.

TI  - Biofuels, climate change, and human population
AB  - Fossil liquid fuels and other resources are being extracted on finite planet Earth and utilized to the point that they are becoming more costly and some are expected to become scarce within the next decade. There are tight interrelationships and overlapping effects among proposed use of biofuels, climate change, and overall consumption by still-growing human populations. Countries with a preponderance of advanced technologies consume disproportionately large quantities of fossil fuels, with the accompanying production of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas whose increasing concentration in Earthâ€™s atmosphere is warming the planet and producing mostly negative consequences for coastal cities, ocean life, and agriculture.

TI  - The utilization of passive design strategies within the design process of passenger vessels operating within the mediterranean to support EEDI compliance
AB  - Amidst growing legislative and social pressures, and rising fuel costs the marine industry is turning its attention to its growing global CO2 emissions. Adjustments to MARPOL Annex IV and the now mandatory compliance of the EEDI have spurred the emergence of new hull optimization and propulsion technologies with LNG fuels and various material flow strategies being common discourse in recent sustainability reports. However, it is clear from energy audits that there is significant scope for the improvement in auxiliaries such as HVAC and lighting to reduce CO2 emissions. The architectural industry; being well accustomed in the reduction of operational loads, has developed integrative design tools, guidelines and legislation to stimulate the use of passive strategies in the reduction of emissions from the EU building stock, which is supported by international policy such as the 2002 Energy performance of buildings directive - which requires all new buildings from 2016 to produce more energy than they consume. This paper identifies the potential of Passive Design as transfer of innovation from the architectural industry, through a parametric analysis methodology which considers the holistic benefits of improved fabric, form, fenestration and lighting. An analysis of the results indicates that designing to the environment of operation, or bioclimatic design, is the key to attaining good energy performance, resulting in significant economic and ecological savings.

TI  - Maintaining marine diesel emissions using performance monitoring
AB  - Ships are an integral part of modern commercial transport, leisure travel, and military system. A diesel engine was used for the first time for the propulsion of a ship sometime in the 1910s and has been the choice for propulsion and power generation, ever since. Since the first model used in ship propulsion, the diesel engine has come a long way with several technological advances. A diesel engine has a particularly high thermal efficiency. Added to it, the higher energy density of the diesel fuel compared to gasoline fuel makes it inherently, the most efficient internal combustion engine. The modern diesel engine also has a very unique ability to work with a variety of fuels like diesel, heavy fuel oil, biodiesel, vegetable oils, and several other crude oil distillates which is very important considering the shortage of petroleum fuels that we face today. In spite of being highly efficient and popular and in spite of all the technological advances, the issue of exhaust gas emissions has plagued a diesel engine. This issue has gained a lot of importance since 1990s when IMO, EU, and the EPA came up with the Tier I exhaust gas emission norms for the existing engine in order to reduce the NOx and SOx. Harsher Tier II and Tier III norms were later announced for newer engines. Diesel fuels commonly used in marine engines are a form of residual fuel, also know as Dregs or Heavy Fuel Oil and are essentially the by products of crude oil distillation process used to produce lighter petroleum fuels like marine distillate fuel and gasoline. They are cheaper than marine distillate fuels but are also high in nitrogen, sulfur and ash content. This greatly increases the NOx and SOx in the exhaust gas emission. Ship owners are trapped between the need to use residual fuels, due to cost of the large volume of fuel consumed, in order to keep the operation of their ships to a competitive level on one hand and on the other hand the need to satisfy the stringent pollution norms as established by the pollution control agencies worldwide. Newer marine diesel engines are being designed to meet the Tier II and Tier III norms wherever applicable but the existing diesel engine owners are still operating their engines with the danger of not meeting the applicable pollution norms worldwide. Here we make an effort to look at some of the measure that the existing marine diesel engine owners can take to reduce emissions and achieve at least levels prescribed in Tier I. Proper maintenance and upkeep of the engine components can be effectively used to reduce the exhaust gas emission. We introduced a pilot program on diesel engine performance monitoring in North America about two years ago and it has yielded quite satisfying results for several shipping companies and more and more ship owners are looking at the option of implementing this program on their ships.

TI  - Renewable energy in the South Pacific - options and constraints
AB  - Over the last fifteen years the small island nations in the South Pacific have seen the introduction of various forms of renewable energy technologies. In spite of high expectations from the development of indigenous renewable energy resources using nonconventional approaches ((wind power, wave power, ocean thermal energy conversion, biogas digesters, biomass gasifiers), these technologies have largely failed to develop into viable alternatives to conventional approaches (based on imported petroleum, biomass and hydroelectric power). Among the few exceptions are solar photovoltaic power for remote islands, especially when provided through a utility type institution, solar water heaters, and the use of biomass wastes by agroindustries. As a result, all the island countries are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy requirements. Some of them to such an extent that their petroleum imports are up to 500\% of their total exports. As far as acceptance of new renewable energy technologies by the Pacific communities goes hasty decisions and introductions have done more harm than good. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Efficiently remove of diesel oil pollutants in the marine environment by a novel biological-C14H32O3Si-Enteromorpha: Preparation, mechanism, and application
AB  - Enteromorpha has large biomass and high specific surface area, and C14H32O3Si can help Enteromorpha achieved hydrophobic and oleophilic. However, the diesel oil adsorption capacity of C14H32O3Si-Enteromorpha was limited. Herein, biological modification was adopted to C14H32O3Si-Enteromorpha and the diesel oil adsorption capacity was successfully improved. A biological-C14H32O3Si-Enteromorpha adsorbent was prepared at first, and the adsorption mechanism of diesel oil was comprehensively analyzed by surface morphology, docking mode, adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm. Last, biological-C14H32O3Si-Enteromorpha adsorbent was applied in a small-scale reactor, the diesel oil removal rate and the reusability of adsorbent was studied. The diesel oil adsorption capacity of successful biological modification of C14H32O3Si-Enteromorpha was 14.56 g/g, representing a 27.72 \% increase. The diesel oil removal capacity improved due to functional groups added and hydrogen bonds formed after the C14H32O3Si-Enteromorpha modification. Meanwhile, the mainly diesel oil adsorption process of biological-C14H32O3Si-Enteromorpha was chemical adsorption. Furthermore, biological-C14H32O3Si-Enteromorpha has efficient and recycling potential for diesel oil adsorption application, which was greater than 80 \% diesel oil removal rate after six cycles of adsorption experiments. Our reported biological modification C14H32O3Si-Enteromorpha will provide a new avenue to treat marine oil pollution and contribute to the protection of marine ecological environment.

TI  - Comprehensive feasibility assessment of a poly-generation process integrating fast pyrolysis of S. japonica and the Rankine cycle
AB  - Marine macroalgae or seaweeds are increasingly becoming strong candidates for sustainable biofuel feedstocks of the future. This study features a large-scale process design and comprehensive analysis of an industrial-scale (400,000 tons dry feedstock per year) poly-generation pyrolysis process that utilizes 3rd generation biofuel feedstock, Saccharina japonica brown seaweed, and produces diesel-range hydrocarbon fuel, heat, and power. Process design relied predominately on published experimental data regarding fast pyrolysis of S. japonica in a fixed-bed reactor system, followed by dewatering and catalytic upgrading of the produced biocrude. The design featured acid wash pretreatment for the reduction of mineral content, and subsequently a Rankine power cycle utilizing biochar. The design also considered two distinct cases of on-site hydrogen production and hydrogen purchase. Based on the experimental data, a rigorous steady-state flowsheet model was constructed using Aspen Plus for each design case. The results of comprehensive techno-economic assessment, sensitivity, and Monte Carlo analyses provided insight into capital cost for the process, minimum product selling price, and selling price ranges. Finally, the process is compared with traditional crude oil extraction and processing in terms of significant reductions in CO2 emissions, hence providing strong evidence of its environmental sustainability.

AB  - The push to find alternatives to fossil fuels has driven research and consumption of biofuels. Recent actions in the United States have placed an emphasis on the use of renewable fuels for improved sustainability of government operations. In 2013, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) measured atmospheric emissions from two navigation vessels consuming three different fuel types and found that biofuels have the potential to lower atmospheric emissions. These fuels have widely different production processes, however, and a full life-cycle assessment is necessary to provide a complete picture of these biofuels. The goal of this study was to identify whether transitioning navigation vessels to operate on biodiesel would have the potential to lower human health and environmental impacts. This study focuses on the complete life cycle of these fuels in USACE marine vessels by employing a well-to-wheels life-cycle assessment comparing the impacts of a 100% soy-based biodiesel and an algal-based biodiesel blend to a conventional diesel. Overall, soybean-based biodiesel had lower impacts compared to algal-based biodiesel. Impacts from conventional diesel were generally lower than algal-based biodiesel, but impacts between conventional diesel and soybean-based biodiesel were mixed. While greenhouse gas emissions during the use phase were reduced for the biofuels (after considering only the non-biogenic fraction of carbon emission), a complete look at the life-cycle resulted in cases where emissions could be greater than conventional diesel. Biodiesel impacts depended greatly on modeling assumptions made in the life-cycle system boundaries and inventory such as allocation method and assumptions about feedstock growth and harvesting.

TI  - Characterization and Analysis of Malaysian Macroalgae Biomass as Potential Feedstock for Bio-Oil Production
AB  - The potential of Caulerpa lentillifera, Gracilaria coronopifolia and Chaetomorpha linum, as biomass feedstock was investigated in this study. It was concluded that seaweed is more suitable for bio-based products synthesis, i.e., bioplastic and bio-lubricants, instead of biofuels due to its relatively low calorific value (similar to 12 MJ/kg). Since seaweed has high moisture content (similar to 80\%), hydrothermal liquefaction is recommended, and its efficiency can be further enhanced through microwave technology. Besides, it is found that the thermal degradation of seaweed was best described with the reaction order of 1. The kinetic results also indicated that seaweed consists of lower activation energy (<30 kJ/mol) in comparison with terrestrial biomass (50-170 kJ/mol). Hence, seaweed has a high potential to be used as biomass feedstock, particularly Chaetomorpha linum, as it has no conflict with other interests. Lastly, acetic-acid pre-treatment was suggested to be an optional process in order to increase the algal conversion efficiency as it can reduce up to 25\% of ash content.

TI  - Reduction of the Gaseous Emissions in the Marine Diesel Engine Using Biodiesel Mixtures
AB  - Taking into consideration the quality of air, it is necessary to ensure a continued reduction of the gaseous emissions that are produced by the maritime transport. The most effective solution of this serious worldwide problem is application of a suitable fuel mixture, which contains a bio-component, i.e. the biofuel. The presented scientific study is focused on influence of the biofuels on production of the gaseous emissions in the case of a diesel auxiliary engine, which is used in the ship transport. There were created various fuel mixtures with different content of the bio-component in order to investigate their emission characteristics. The individual experimental measurements were performed at the different engine loading levels and using a variable engine speed spectrum. The obtained results demonstrated a significant influence of the fuel mixtures on the whole combustion process, on the heat release process, on the pressure time behaviour as well as on the engine emission characteristics.

TI  - History and potential of renewable energy development in New Zealand
AB  - Many years before greenhouse gas emission reduction became a major driver for renewable energy development, New Zealand was an early adopter of several alternative energy technologies, particularly hydroelectricity and geothermal energy. It has achieved a level of 60% of total electricity generation from such sources, and is now pursuing a target of 95% of electricity generation from renewable energy, to be achieved in fifteen years. In recent years, however, the development of renewables has lagged that of other countries, particularly in fields such as wind power. The paper reviews the history, current status and potential of the major renewable energy technologies in New Zealand, and suggests what may be current barriers to development. It is seen that the likely major contributors to replacing fossil fuel based energy are likely to be wind power and expanded geothermal energy use, with biomass, marine and solar energy sources likely to play a lesser role. The barriers to development include environmental issues, the opportunity cost of biomass feedstocks, and a policy environment offering less incentive to RE development than is the case in many other countries.

TI  - Marine microalgae flocculation and focused beam reflectance measurement
AB  - The production of biodiesel from fast growing and lipid containing marine microalgal species is sustainably and economically more promising than fresh water microalgae. However, like fresh water microalgae, the process is limited by numerous factors such as the generally dilute nature of microalgal cultures, and the small size of microalgae cells, except for multi-cellular species such as Spirulina. Current dewatering technologies are sufficiently able to separate microalgae from the culture media; however the economics of the process makes these technologies ineffective as they are all too expensive when compared with the low cost of biodiesel from other sources. Centrifugation, which is one of the current technologies, is highly energy intensive especially in a large-scale setting. Filtration techniques such as tangential flow filtration has the potential to be a low cost dewatering technique, however there is a cost issue associated with the replacement of clogged membranes. Flocculation is another commonly used dewatering technique that has the advantage of using less energy under optimum conditions. Thus process development for marine microalgae flocculation could be an essential step to revolutionize biodiesel production from microalgae.In this work, mixed cultures of marine microalgal species were obtained from semi-continuous laboratory reactors and flocculation was investigated using polyelectrolyte (polymer) flocculants. Cationic, anionic and non-ionic polyelectrolyte flocculants were tested using the standard jar stirrer test at varying pH and temperature. All three flocculant types displayed suitability for microalgae flocculation with the cationic polymer obtaining the highest flocculation efficiency of 89.9% at an optimum concentration of 4. mg/L. Focused beam reflectance measurements (FBRM) showed real time changes in microalgal flocs size during the flocculation process. This data is essential to understand the kinetics of microalgal flocs formation, to ensure the stability of the floc formation process, and to monitor and evaluate the performance of the flocculation process.

TI  - Towards decarbonization of shipping: direct emissions & life cycle impacts from a biofuel trial aboard an ocean-going dry bulk vessel
AB  - On board emission measurements from a dry bulk vessel operating on an advanced biofuel, produced from used cooking oil (UCO), are reported for the first time, in an effort to assess potential benefits and impacts compared to conventional fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission measurements were performed on a slow-speed, two-stroke marine diesel engine of a Kamsarmax vessel, while burning a 50 : 50 biofuel blend of UCO biodiesel and marine gas oil (MGO). The same gases were monitored, under similar conditions, while the vessel was burning solely low-sulfur MGO (LSMGO) allowing for relevant comparisons. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions were also calculated for the tested fuels. Apart from comparing the biofuel blend with LSMGO in terms of direct emissions from combustion, indirect emissions associated with the extraction, production and transportation of both fuels were estimated based on recent literature. Life cycle emissions were also estimated for different scenarios involving conventional marine fuels for performing the same voyage. Marginal differences were observed regarding CO2 and NOx emissions of the tested fuels, while the SO2 emissions of the biofuel blend were about 50% lower compared to LSMGO. Although the biofuel blend generates combustion CO2 emissions very similar to those of conventional marine fuels, it can achieve up to 40% emissions reduction from a life cycle analysis (LCA) perspective. These results, combined with the fact that no operational issues occurred during the biofuel trial, show that such fuels have significant potential towards the decarbonization of dry bulk shipping.

TI  - Modelling large-scale CO2 leakages in the North Sea
AB  - A three dimensional hydrodynamic model with a coupled carbonate speciation sub-model is used to simulate large additions of CO2 into the North Sea, representing leakages at potential carbon sequestration sites. A range of leakage scenarios are conducted at two distinct release sites, allowing an analysis of the seasonal, inter-annual and spatial variability of impacts to the marine ecosystem. Seasonally stratified regions are shown to be more vulnerable to CO2 release during the summer as the added CO2 remains trapped beneath the thermocline, preventing outgasing to the atmosphere. On average, CO2 injected into the northern North Sea is shown to reside within the water column twice as long as an equivalent addition in the southern North Sea before reaching the atmosphere. Short-term leakages of 5000 tonnes CO2 over a single day result in substantial acidification at the release sites (up to -1.92 pH units), with significant perturbations (greater than 0.1 pH units) generally confined to a 10 km radius. Long-term CO2 leakages sustained for a year may result in extensive plumes of acidified seawater, carried by major advective pathways. Whilst such scenarios could be harmful to marine biota over confined spatial scales, continued unmitigated CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are predicted to result in greater and more long-lived perturbations to the carbonate-system over the next few decades.

TI  - Transforming the global energy system is required to avoid the sixth mass extinction
AB  - This study argues that the climate changes resulting from the continued burning of fossil fuels at present rates will very likely initiate extinction of many terrestrial and marine species, beginning by mid-century. Under this scenario, interactions of climate change with other well-known extinction threats promise to trigger a loss of life that has not been seen since an asteroid-strike eliminated most dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Avoiding this will require a very rapid shift of both our stationary and transportation energy sectors to carbon-neutral systems. Mass extinctions, which result in loss of at least an estimated 75\% of known species over a geologically short time period, are very rare in the 540 million year history of complex life on Earth. Only five have been recognized, the most recent of which occurred 66 million years ago, ending the reign of dinosaurs and opening the door for domination of the planet eventually by humans, who have now accelerated biodiversity loss to the extent that a Sixth Mass Extinction is plausible. Accelerated extinction rates up to now primarily have been due to human-caused habitat destruction and overexploitation of economically valuable species. Climate change caused by burning of fossil fuels adds a new and critically problematic extinction driver because the pace and magnitude of change exceeds what many species have experienced in their evolutionary history, and rapid climate change multiplies the already-existing threats. Particularly at risk are regions that contain most of the world's species, such as rainforest and coral reef ecosystems. Avoiding severe losses that would commit many species to extinction by 2100 will require transforming global energy systems to carbon-neutral ones by 2050. Currently, the transformation is occurring too slowly to avoid worst-case extinction scenarios.

TI  - Carbon and carbonate metabolism in coastal aquatic ecosystems
AB  - The coastal zone is where land, ocean, and atmosphere interact. It exhibits a wide diversity of geomorphological types and ecosystems, each one displaying great variability in terms of physical and biogeochemical forcings. Despite its relatively modest surface area, the coastal zone plays a considerable role in the biogeochemical cycles because it receives massive inputs of terrestrial organic matter and nutrients, is among the most geochemically and biologically active areas of the biosphere, and exchanges large amounts of matter and energy with the open ocean. Coastal ecosystems have therefore attracted much attention recently and are the focus of several current national and international research programs (e.g. LOICZ, ELOISE). The primary production, respiration, calcification, carbon burial and exchange with adjacent systems, including the atmosphere, are reviewed for the major coastal ecosystems (estuaries, macrophyte communities, mangroves, coral reefs, and the remaining continental shelf). All ecosystems examined, except estuaries, are net autotrophic. The contribution of the coastal zone to the global carbon cycle both during pristine times and at present is difficult to assess due to the limited metabolic data available as well as because of major uncertainties concerning the magnitude of processes such as respiration, exchanges at the open ocean boundary, and air-sea fluxes of biogases.

TI  - The ecological hovercraft - Dream or reality!
AB  - The European Union is very active on global market of emission to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport. There is currently no international regulation of emissions from this transport, but the new generation biofuel technology is critical for reducing emission of wide range of transport resources including a small water transport. The paper presents the results of preliminary biofuel tests of ecological fuel BioE85 on the hovercraft PRP 600 M/10, which was manufactured in Poland by Institute of Aviation. A hovercraft transport is all known a hybrid transport vehicle and the tests confirmed significant changes in emission using biofuel with 85% of ethanol and will help to support the idea of new generation of biofuels that reduce the environmental pollution on land, sea and air.

TI  - Responses of microbial community from tropical pristine coastal soil to crude oil contamination
AB  - Brazilian offshore crude oil exploration has increased after the discovery of new reservoirs in the region known as pre-sal, in a depth of 7.000 m under the water surface. Oceanic islands near these areas represent sensitive environments, where changes in microbial communities due oil contamination could stand for the loss of metabolic functions, with catastrophic effects to the soil services provided from these locations. This work aimed to evaluate the effect of petroleum contamination on microbial community shifts (Archaea, Bacteria and Fungi) from Trindade Island coastal soils. Microcosms were assembled and divided in two treatments, control and contaminated (weathered crude oil at the concentration of 30 g kg(-1)), in triplicate. Soils were incubated for 38 days, with CO2 measurements every four hours. After incubation, the total DNA was extracted, purified and submitted for target sequencing of 16S rDNA, for Bacteria and Archaea domains and Fungal ITS1 region, using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Three days after contamination, the CO2 emission rate peaked at more than 20x the control and the emissions remained higher during the whole incubation period. Microbial alpha-diversity was reduced for contaminated-samples. Fungal relative abundance of contaminated samples was reduced to almost 40\% of the total observed species. Taxonomy comparisons showed rise of the Actinobacteria phylum, shifts in several Proteobacteria classes and reduction of the Archaea class Nitrososphaerales. This is the first effort in acquiring knowledge concerning the effect of crude oil contamination in soils of a Brazilian oceanic island. This information is important to guide any future bioremediation strategy that can be required.

TI  - Electron shuttling mediated by humic substances fuels anaerobic methane oxidation and carbon burial in wetland sediments
AB  - Key pathways for the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) have remained elusive, particularly in organic rich ecosystems. In this work, the occurrence of AOM driven by humus-catalyzed dissimilatory iron reduction was investigated in sediments from a coastal mangrove swamp. Anoxic sediment incubations supplied with both goethite (Î±-FeOOH) and leonardite (humic substances (HS)) displayed an average AOM rate of 10.7 Â± 0.8 Î¼mol CH4 cmâˆ’3 dayâˆ’1, which was 7 and 3 times faster than that measured in incubations containing only goethite or HS, respectively. Additional incubations performed with 13C-methane displayed Pahokee Peat HS-mediated carbonate precipitation linked to 13CH4 oxidation and ferrihydrite reduction (~1.3 Î¼mol carbonate cmâˆ’3 dayâˆ’1). These results highlight the role of HS on mitigating greenhouse gases released from wetlands, not only by mediating the AOM process, but also by enhancing carbon sequestration as inert minerals (calcite, aragonite and siderite).

TI  - Wave energy resource assessment in Lanzarote (Spain)
AB  - Lanzarote (Canary Islands, Spain) is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (since 1993) located in the Atlantic Ocean. The island is aiming to change its energy production model in order to reduce its dependence on external, fossil-fuel-based energy sources. The local authorities hope to develop an energy production model based on clean, renewable sources, such as wave energy converters (WECs). This study analyses the island's wave energy resources using a 51-year series of data obtained from numerical modelling (hindcast and forecast). The spatial distribution of wave power is analysed using data from nine points around the island. Significant resources (average wave power exceeding 30 kW/m and average annual wave energy of more than 270 MW h/m) are found to the north of the island, as well as to the west and the east (average wave power 25-30 kW/m). Considerable seasonal variability is found, with winters being rather high-energetic and summers quite mild. Variability coefficients are computed in order to select the best locations for WECs; the composition of the resource at each location is examined in terms of sea states in order to evaluate the suitability of WEC installation. Finally, three sites with similar conditions, all located on the north side of the island, are selected as the best candidates for WEC deployment. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Potential of Gracilaria sp. as single- or co-digestion feedstock for biogas production
AB  - High consumption of fossil fuels in Indonesia needs to be reduced by using renewable energy, such as from biomass. In Indonesia, as one of the largest maritime countries, macroalgae (i.e. seaweed) are also considered as potential renewable biomass feedstocks for substituting any land biomass. This study aimed to investigate biodegradability and biogas potential of macroalgae (Gracilaria sp.) as single- or co-digestion feedstock using anaerobic digestion technology. The biochemical methane potential (BMP) test was carried out for 28 days at temperature of 37 degrees C to investigate the specific methane potential. All samples were in triplicate. Combinations of Gracilaria sp. with various biomass feedstocks (i.e. food waste, tofu dregs) were also tested. The findings indicated a potential valorisation of macroalgae for biogas production either as single or co-digestion feedstock, as well as a potential for electricity generation. However, further optimisation process is required for better and higher degradation process.

AB  - Bio Methane potential of marine microalgae Nannochloropsis oculata is determined in a 5-L batch digestion setup. N. oculata is grown in an open raceway pond at 25 degree C, with 1% C02 and 99% air supplied. N. oculata was grown for 2-3 weeks to final concentration of 600-800 mg/L, and then harvested in a 30-gallon batch by adding base and concentrating algae to 3.15% volatile solids. The average Bio Methane potential of N. oculata is determined as 204.3 LCH4/kg VS with the total digestion time of 52-66 days. Anaerobic microbes adapts to the saline conditions, displaying reduced lag for methane production with inoculum reuse. Anaerobic digestion eliminates the need of dewatering, extraction or economical separation, which is required in other biofuel production from algae. N. oculata is not rich in oil but contains predominantly cellulose and other carbohydrates, which makes it a good feedstock for anaerobic digestion. N. oculata grown in an open raceway pond, harvested and then digested anaerobically as presented in following study has the potential to supply energy need (electric or natural gas) of one household with utilization of 1.83 acre of land.

TI  - Combustion of lignocellulosic biomass and marine biomass by means of thermal analyses: Kinetic and gas evolution analysis
AB  - Biomass fuels are gaining particular attention as a potential alternative to increase energy independence of fossil fuels and reduce environmental pollution. The main ones refer to lignocellulosic biomass and marine biomass (especially microalgae). There is a growing interest in the cultivation of lignocellulosic biomass for energy production as they typically have less capital-intensive conversion technologies, attractive opportunity for local and regional self-sufficiency, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and viable alternative to fossil fuel use. On the other hand, microalgae have received increasing attention due to the fact that they can be cultured in ponds or photobioreactors with supply of nutrients or waste water. Moreover, the production of microalgae does not require of high quality arable land and therefore it does not compete with food crops. Direct combustion is the oldest and still the most commonly used route for converting biomass to heat, power and combined heat and power. Combustion can be defined as the conversion of biomass fuels to several forms of useful energy in the presence of air or oxygen. Despite its inherent potential as a biofuel resource, the commercial viability of biomass combustion technology has not been achieved yet. In this regard, thermogravimetric analysis is one of the most common techniques used to rapidly investigate and compare thermal events and kinetics during combustion of biomass. TGA provides useful information concerning the temperatures at which combustion or decomposition reactions in the sample start. Biomass characteristics and kinetics of biomass combustion are essential for modeling the combustion in industrial processes. Therefore, from TGA data suitable mathematical models can be derived for a better comprehension of the oxidation behavior of these complex feedstock that allow to perform economic analysis and develop technology for a more efficient biomass conversion. Additionally, during the combustion of biomass, the composition of the gas emissions should be determined before industrial application. In spite of the environmental advantages, some aspects concerning the release of contaminants during biomass combustion must be taken into account. In this regard, NOx and SOx emissions depend on raw biomass composition, which usually is variable. Furthermore, the chloride amount in biomass might turn into operational problems such as corrosion. Other organic compounds such as benzene and toluene are considered to be part of the most dangerous emissions from biomass combustion causing diseases as lung infection and leukemia. Therefore, the knowledge of pollutant release during biomass conversion is truly important in order to reassure the use of biomass from the environmental point of view. In this regard, the coupling of thermogravimetric analysis with mass spectrometry (TGA-MS) stands out as the only experimental technique able to afford real-time and sensitive detection of evolved gases from the thermochemical conversion of a very small sample. In this chapter, the combustion behavior and the gas evolution analysis of different biomass feedstock (lignocellulosic and microalgae) by means of TGA-MS will be addressed. Finally, the kinetic analysis of the combustion process will be presented. Â© 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Innovating carbon-capture biotechnologies through ecosystem-inspired solutions
AB  - Rising atmospheric carbon concentrations affect global health, the economy, and overall quality of life. We are fast approaching climate tipping points that must be addressed, not only by reducing emissions but also through new innovation and action toward carbon capture for sequestration and utilization (CCSU). In this perspective, we delineate next-generation biotechnologies for CCSU supported by engineering design principles derived from ecological processes inspired by three major biomes (plant-soil, deep biosphere, and marine). These are to interface with existing industrial infrastructure and, in some cases, tap into the carbon sink potential of nature. To develop ecosystem-inspired biotechnology, it is important to identify accessible control points of CO2 and CH4 within a given system as well as value-chain opportunities that drive innovation. In essence, we must supplement natural biogeochemical carbon sinks with new bioengineering solutions.

TI  - Structural Impacts, Carbon Losses, and Regeneration in Mangrove Wetlands after Two Hurricanes on St. John, US Virgin Islands
AB  - Hurricanes Irma and Maria ravaged the mangroves of St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands, in 2017. Basal area losses were large (63-100\%) and storm losses of carbon associated with aboveground biomass amounted to 11.9-43.5 Mg C/ha. Carbon biomass of dead standing trees increased 8.1-18.3 Mg C/ha among sites, and carbon in coarse woody debris on the forest floor increased 1.9-18.2 Mg C/ha, with effects varying by mangrove typology. While St. John has only similar to 45 ha of mangroves, they exist as isolated basins, salt ponds, and fringe mangroves; the latter sometimes support diverse marine communities. Salt pond and fringe mangroves had proportionately more organic carbon (46.3 Mg C/ha) than inorganic carbon (1.1 Mg C/ha) in soils than isolated basins. Soil organic carbon was also appreciable in isolated basins (30.8 Mg C/ha) but was matched by inorganic C (36.7 Mg C/ha), possibly due to adjacent land use history (e.g., road construction), previous storm overwash, or geomorphology. Soil nitrogen stocks were low across all typologies. Mangroves had limited regeneration 26 months after the storms, and recovery on St. John may be hindered by pre-storm hydrologic change in some stands, and potential genetic bottlenecks and lack of propagule sources for expedient recovery in all stands.

TI  - Ocean uptake potential for carbon dioxide sequestration
AB  - For the assessment of the long-term consequences of the carbon dioxide ocean sequestration, the C02 injection into the middle depth parts of the ocean was simulated using a geochemical box model of the global carbon cycle. The model consists of 19 reservoir boxes and includes all the essential processes in the global biogeochemical cycles, such as the ocean thermohaline circulation, the solubility pump, the biological pump, the alkalinity pump and the terrestrial ecosystem responses. The present study aims to reveal the effectiveness and consequences of the direct ocean C02 sequestration in relation to both lowering the atmospheric transient PCO2 peak and reduction in future C02 uptake potential of the ocean. We should note that the direct ocean injection of C02 at the present time means the acceleration of the pH lowering in the middle ocean due to the eventual and inevitable increase Of C02 in the atmosphere, if the same amount Of C02 is added into the atmosphere-ocean system. The minimization of impact to the whole marine ecosystem might be attainable by the direct ocean C02 sequestration through suppressing a decrease in the pH of the surface ocean rich in biota. The geochemical implication of the ocean sequestration is such that the maximum C02 amount to invade into the ocean, i.e., the oceanic C02 uptake potential integrated with time until the end of fossil fuel era, is only dependent on the atmospheric PCO2, value in the ultimate steady state, whether or not the CO2 is purposefully injected into the ocean; we gave the total potential capacity of the ocean for the C02 sequestration is about 1600 GtC in the case of atmospheric steady state value (PCO2), of 550 ppmv.

TI  - Effect of low frequency electromagnetic field on the behavior and bioenergetics of the polychaete Hediste diversicolor
AB  - The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of an electromagnetic field (EMF) of value typically recorded in the vicinity of submarine cables (50 Hz, 1 mT) on the behavior and bioenergetics of the polychaete Hediste diversicolor. No avoidance or attraction behavior to EMF was shown, but the burrowing activity of H. diversicolor was enhanced in EMF treatment, indicating a stimulating effect on bioturbation potential. The polychaete maintained a positive energy balance and high amount (85% of assimilated energy) of energy available for individual production (scope for growth) after exposure to EMF. Food consumption and respiration rates were not affected but ammonia excretion rate was significantly reduced in EMF-exposed animals compared to the control conditions (geomagnetic field). The mechanisms behind this effect remain, however, unclear. This is the first study demonstrating the effects of environmentally realistic EMF value on the behavior and physiology of marine invertebrates, thus there is a need for more research.

TI  - DEVELOPMENT OF A SCALABLE CULTIVATION SYSTEM FOR SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION OF ALGAL BIOFUELS
AB  - Algae are a promising source of renewable jet and diesel fuels and can play a significant role in climate change mitigation as a low-carbon fuel source. Currently, most industrial microalgae cultivation systems are open ponds because of their low capital and operating costs, but they suffer from low biomass productivity and high risk of contamination. We describe the development of a novel, cost-effective, and modular horizontal bioreactor (HBR) for algae cultivation. It was designed and engineered to keep costs low, while minimizing water and energy use and enhancing CO2 and nutrient uptake. The selected marine microalgal strain, Nannochloris oculata, has shown potential for biofuels production. Algal growth was first optimized indoors before testing the HBR performance outdoors under real-world conditions. The indoor study showed that urea and potassium nitrate yield comparable results, when used as nitrogen source, whereas ammonium chloride was less effective. Varying inoculum size from 10\% to 15\% to 20\% (v/v) had no effect on lag time, so the lowest level was selected. The 150-L HBR prototype was tested outdoors with N. oculata using the indoor optimal conditions. High-density growth was consistently achieved in the HBR without contamination problems over extended periods of time outdoors in central Florida.

TI  - Analysis and prospect of new energy utilization technology for ships
AB  - In order to reduce the world greenhouse gas emissions every year, International Maritime Organization has set up Emission Control Area in the world. Ships sailing to the waters of these areas need to be replaced with cleaner oil with sulfur content no more than 1% and the requirement has been improved to 0.5% in globally since 2020, it is very urgent and necessary to study the replacement of ship new energy in the large emission of ships. This paper focuses on the new energy utilization technology of ships. Firstly, it introduces the necessity and urgency of new alternative fuels. Then, it makes a comparative study and analysis of new alternative fuels for ships, focusing on the technical research from liquefied petroleum gas, LNG, hydrogen, biofuels, and methanol. Finally, it makes a detailed comparative analysis of each energy source and puts forward the realization path. The results of this study are helpful to the utilization and development of new marine energy, and have important role for the greenhouse gas emission reduction of international shipping.

TI  - Can biofuels alleviate the energy and environmental crisis?
AB  - Climate change is one of the major challenges society is facing currently. Major spheres of human activity such as health, environment, agriculture, economy, transportation and education were adversely affected because of climate change. Environmental pollution owing to the indiscriminate and ever-increasing consumption of fossil-based resources is the main factor contributing to climate change. Use of fuels produced from renewable sources like biomass cause reduction in CO2 emission and guarantee sustainable energy and a clean environment. The problems of environmental deterioration, as well as energy demands, could be alleviated by the paradigm shift to the use of biofuels from fossil fuels. Innovative strategies were recently developed for the exploitation of biomass for biofuels production. The concept of biomass itself is being understood in an unconventional sense in a way that apart from terrestrial plant resources, marine macroalgae, freshwater microalgae, industrial emissions like CO2, organic remains like glycogen are being explored as feedstock for biofuels production. Biofuel production strategies are also undergoing drastic changes like the use of solar radiation, sonochemical, microwave and accelerated electron beam irradiations to meet the fuel demand and to make the biomass conversion processes more energy- and atom-efficient and sustainable. The objective of the compilation of the book titled â€œCan Biofuels Alleviate The Energy & Environmental Crisis?â€ is to reach out to policy makers, scientists, industrialists, and students with a message as well as scientific strategies for alleviating the twin problems of energy and environmental crisis posing a threat to future generations. The book comprises of seven judiciously designed chapters focused on producing biofuels (biodiesel, bioethanol, formic acid, synthesis gas, methane, and ethylene) and biochemicals (glucose, levulinic acid) using feedstock as diverse as lignocellulosic terrestrial biomass, marine macroalgae, glycogen, and CO2. Biomass is an ideal substitute to fossil mass as almost all the products derived from conventional refinery could be produced in a biorefinery using biomass as a carbon source. In addition to being sustainable, the biorefinery facilities are environmentally benign. The biomass conversion strategies proposed in this book facilitate the paradigm shift from fossil-based to biobased industries and help the proliferation of biorefinery facilities in the 21st century, offering a pathway for the alleviation of the problem of climate change.

TI  - Renewable energies as of 2006 globally and in Europe [Erneuerbare energien. Stand 2006 weltweit und in Europa]
AB  - In many countries of the Third World, now as before renewable energies are the most significantly used energy source yet also in industrial countries renewable energies increasingly contribute to the covering of the demand for electrical, thermal, and motor fuel energy. A survey covers the status quo of the use of renewable energies worldwide and in Europe. In these terms, electrical energy comes primarily from hydropower, geothermal sources, and biomass, and increasingly, from wind energy, and thermal energy comes foremost from solid fuels. Biogenic motor fuels, especially alcohol, have significance. Despite the high growth rate of the renewable energy sector its coverage of global energy demand remains comparably small. The discussion covers introduction; fossil primary energy use; hydropower (running, storage, and small hydropower, tidal energy, ocean energy); wind energy; solar energy (heat generation, electricity generation); geothermal energy (heat generation, electricity generation); biomass (heat generation, electricity generation, motor fuel preparation); and conclusion and outlook. In 2005, water power worldwide had at about 3,201 Tw-hr or 88% the largest share of worldwide electricity generation from renewable energies. Wind energy generated 89 to 148 Tw-hr of electricity, geothermal energy about 57 Tw-hr, and biomass at least 206-316 Tw-hr. In comparison, globally, photovoltaic and solar thermal electricity generation with all told 3.5-5 Tw-hr was almost insignificant. All told, in 2005 3,642 Tw-hr of electricity were generated from renewable energy. This corresponded to about 20% of worldwide electricity generation (18,180 Tw-hr) or about 3.2% of global fossil primary energy use. Not basically different was the situation in the EU-25, where about 500 Tw-hr of electricity were generated from renewable energies, of which 71% was from hydropower, 14% from wind energy, and 14% from biomass. All other renewable energy options were insignificant. Relative to the fossil primary energy use in the EU-25 (68.2 Ej), electricity generation from renewable energies was 2.6%. Results are also provided for heat generation in the world and EU-25. The contribution of biogenic motor fuels in 2005 was limited primarily to biodiesel and bioethanol. Worldwide 33.5 billion L bioethanol (710 Pj) and 4.0 billion L biodiesel (140 Pj) were sold, totaling about less than 1% of the total motor fuel market. A number of other observations are made.

TI  - Biomass to fuels and chemicals: A review of enabling processes and technologies
AB  - The growing worldwide concern over the environmental impact of our heavy dependence on fossil fuels has provided impetus for biomass utilisation to produce fuels and chemicals. A cost-effective conversion technology stands as a challenge for bio-based fuels and chemicals to be competitive with petroleum-derived products. This review provides an overview of the recent advances in the conversion technologies of biomass, which includes thermochemical and biochemical processes. With a plethora of conversion technologies available, the choice of suitable conversion technology depends on the biomass feedstock availability and the desired end-product. It is observed that present research is focused on the development of catalysts and optimisation of process parameters to improve the economics of conversion technologies. Efforts are also on towards utilisation of cheaper substrate, lignocellulosic biomass and CO2-sequestering algae. Though few technologies have reached the commercial stage, conversion technologies for lignocellulosic and marine biomass are still evolving. Further, much impetus is being given to process optimisation for deriving platform chemicals from biomass for value addition and sustainability of the biorefinery concept. Some key developments in these areas are presented in this review. Â© 2021 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI). Â© 2021 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).

TI  - Enabling Bioeconomy with Offshore Macroalgae Biorefineries
AB  - The bioeconomy provides a possible solution for the increasing demand on natural resources by substitution of the nonrenewable resources with resources derived from biomass, thus reducing the environmental impact of fossil fuels. A fundamental unit that will enable the bioeconomy implementation is biorefinery. The bioeconomy is a collective term for the complex system that includes biomass production, transportation, conversion into products, and product distribution. In this chapter, we introduce the concept of offshore marine biorefineries as potential drivers for the bioeconomy of the future. We discuss fundamental thermodynamics principles that determine the optimum scale of biorefineries and put the limit for the services area for a single-processing unit. We provide a review of the current methods to produce biomass offshore. Next, we exemplify the marine biorefineries, which show co-production of several products from the same biomass, thus reducing the waste and maximizing economic benefit from the unit. In addition, we discuss the economic and environmental challenges of marine biorefineries as an emerging platform for society transition to low-carbon economy.

TI  - Green algae to green fuels: Syngas and hydrochar production from Ulva lactuca via sub-critical water gasification
AB  - Biomass-derived energy is gaining more attention due to environmental issues and increasing energy demand. To ensure the sustainability of fossil energy substitution using biomass, diversification of sources, including marine organisms, is vital. Among various types of marine biomass discussed in the literature, the utilization of green algae Ulva lactuca for energy generation is still rare globally. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the po-tential of green fuel (syngas and hydrochar) production from U. lactuca (Chlorophyta) via sub-critical water gasification (SbWG). The experiments were conducted using a batch reactor at varying temperatures (300, 350, and 400 ?C), reaction times (30, 60, and 90 min), and feedstock concentrations (1 and 5 wt\%). The effect of temperature on gas composition was examined in detail. The results revealed that increasing temperature from 300 to 400 ?C leads to an increase in the H2 content significantly from 2.21 \% to 8.09 \% within 90 min. However, increasing feedstock concentration from 1 to 5 wt\% reduces the H2 fraction due to suppression of the steam reforming and water-gas shift reactions. Based on the ultimate analysis, the high severity of operating conditions leads to lower O/C and H/C atomic ratios owing to dehydration and decarboxylation reactions. It was confirmed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis that more void structures existed in hydrochar than the algal feedstock. The SbWG process at varying temperatures and times can increase the energy contents of U. lactuca by over 47 \%. Intriguingly, hydrochar obtained at 400 ?C exhibited higher HHVs (i.e., 21.75-22.93 MJ kg(-1)) than typical low-ranked coals, making hydrochar more potential to be used as solid fuels. Finally, a reaction model was deduced, and the decomposition of U. lactuca was confirmed to follow the Arrhenius behavior.

TI  - Vision and transition road map to a sustainable energy system
AB  - The long-term challenge for a carbon free future is beyond imagination. To keep the global temperature rise within 2Â°C, it is commonly believed that it is required to convert the energy industry to a net zero CO2-emission by 2070 and a net zero greenhouse gas emission by 2085. For a 1.5 Â°C scenario these numbers should be 20 years earlier. Many studies that are available today are applying derivative road maps in the sense that they show the direction but not the final realizable, affordable and acceptable situation. Constraints for a worldwide implementation of renewable energy sources are numerous. Forecasts indicate that there will be high demands and even shortages of rare earth metals, space and other natural resources. Geopolitical complications limit availability even further. This paper addresses the limitations of the main constraint for Europe but it also sketches a possible alternative solution through a thorough fact finding of natural resources and possible solutions. It also shows the role of the gas industry in this. Clearly no available or promising option, including Carbon Capture and Storage, biogas, CNG, etc. can be excluded in possible future carbon neutral energy sources, but this will not be sufficient to fulfill the world's need of energy. However, a total solution is possible and is outlined. The key outcome is to construct a new backbone for sustainable energy in which ocean space is used to produce cost effective sustainable electricity. Superior knowledge, transport and storage capabilities of the gas industry are used to enable continuous supply of sustainable energy to end users in Europe and worldwide. The oceans provide sufficient space for renewable energy sources. This can be done by (floating) wind turbines, combined with power to gas. Maritime and pipeline technologies can be applied to bring the produced energy ashore and to store for timely use and distribution to customers, thereby facilitating other alternative energy production options and smoothen intermittence of electricity production. Besides meeting the constraints and a net zero CO2 emission this study also addresses backbone functionality (with other sources to support), affordability, acceptance and realization options. In spite of the gigantic construction that results from this study the price for sustainable energy is estimated to be around 5 ct/kWh. Â© 2017, International Gas Union.

TI  - Optimization of performance and emission characteristics of CI engine fueled with waste safflower oil biodiesel and its blends
AB  - Biodiesel production represents a great opportunity to reduce marine and land pollution while incorporating circular economy principles into modern society. The objective of this research is to use the response surface methodology to evaluate the best engine performance and emission characteristics of safflower-based biodiesel and diesel mix dual-fuel Compression ignition engines. The optimization aims to increase brake power, and brake thermal efficiency, and reduce brake-specific fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. The independent input variables were biodiesel blending ratio, compression ratio, and engine load. The novelty of this study is to optimize the operating parameters of a dual-fuel compression ignition engine fueled with safflower biodiesel and diesel blend fraction. A total of 48 experimental trials were conducted. The oil output from safflower seed in the lab and the biodiesel yield obtained were 26% and 91%, respectively. RSM results predict the optimized magnitude of the biodiesel blending ratio, CR, and EL are B16.66, 16.68, and 12 kg, respectively. The optimal values for dependent parameters, that is, BP, BTE, BSFC, CO, UHC, CO2, and NO were 3.27 kW, 19.60%, 3.30 kg/kWh, 0.0006 (% vol.), 0.8 (ppm), 0.78 (% vol.), and 140.87 ppm, respectively. The cumulative composite desirability was found to be 0.5877. Â© 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Potential of biogas production from the anaerobic digestion of Sargassum fulvellum macroalgae: Influences of mechanical, chemical, and biological pretreatments
AB  - Utilization of macroalgal biomass through the anaerobic digestion (AD) system can overcome algal pollution while providing alternative and renewable energy as fuel scarcity increases. To achieve this objective, Sargassum fulvellum biomass was used as the feedstock for the batch AD process. Original-sized algal biomass (So) of 106 Âµmâ€“4.75 mm particle size, reduced-sized biomass of 75â€“850 Âµm (mechanically pretreated, Sr), chemically pretreated reduced-sized wet biomass with 40 mL/L (Sac1), 20 mL/L (Sac2) of 2 M HCl and with 10 mL/L (Sal1) and 5 mL/L (Sal2) of 6 N NaOH, and biologically pretreated original particle size biomass (Se) with 1 mL/L of cellulase enzyme were employed as feedstocks for digestion. Mechanical pretreatment of Sargassum fulvellum (Sr) without chemical addition resulted in 142.91 Â± 0.004 mL CH4/gVS, which is higher than chemically pretreated reduced-sized macroalgae in So, Sac1, Sac2, Sal1, and Sal2 by 52.34%, 9.83%, 15.89%, 12.73%, and 18.26%, respectively. Biological treatment reduced methane yield in Se by 9.49% than the original-sized algal biomass (So). In addition, the rate of hydrolysis and maximum biomethane production potential improved after mechanical pretreatment by a maximum of 45.60% and 48.71%, respectively. This study indicates that the utilization of marine biomass as an alternative resource for biomethane production can be achieved, with an optimum methane production from mechanically pretreated macroalgae without chemical addition.

TI  - Simulation of wind only system with battery energy storage and dump load
AB  - It has become imperative for the power and energy engineers to look out for the renewable energy sources such as sun, wind, geothermal, ocean and biomass as sustainable, cost-effective and environment friendly alternatives for conventional energy sources. However, the non-availability of these renewable energy resources all the time throughout the year has led to research in the area of hybrid renewable energy systems. Since hybrid power systems are mostly used in remote areas where grid-connection may be unavailable; these systems must be self-sufficient in frequency and voltage control. In this paper, other power elements are introduced to provide reliable service to the system load and simulated the wind turbine generator with DL showing graphs for frequency, voltage and active and reactive power for the elements of the system. These elements are called balancing mechanisms, as they balance the system's power output to match the load consumption. Fuel Cells, batteries, dump loads (DL), and fossil fuel based generation have been used as balancing mechanisms. Hybrid power system is simulated and the performance analysis is done in a user friendly MATLAB/Simulink environment. The results show that with DL frequency regulator helps in maintaining system frequency and the voltage variations are reduced. The main objectives of the model implementation are controlled flow of active power. The wind turbine kept under electrical load without losing synchronism with the help of Battery energy storage and the Dump load. Â© 2015 IEEE.

TI  - Sustainability Aspects of Large-Scale Wind Power Development
AB  - Renewable energy is often viewed as the ultimate in sustainable development, especially in comparison with the consumption of fossil fuels for power generation, transportation, and heating and cooling. Renewables consist of a broad range of generating technologies, including biomass, geothermal, wind, solar, ocean energy, and hydropower, which collectively now provide about one quarter of total global generating capacity.1 These energy sources do not consume a finite fuel resource, but tap into sources that are self-renewing or continuous. In fact, with the exception of geothermal, one can argue that all of these renewable energy sources derive ultimately from the sun, for all practical purposes (at least in terms of the duration of the human species) a nearly unlimited energy source.

TI  - Hydrocarbons and chemicals: Potential effects and monitoring in the deep-sea
AB  - For hydrocarbon exploration and production, the inaccessibility of the deep-sea, the low temperature, the high pressure, and the poorly described, but highly diverse biological communities constitute special environmental challenges. For most marine organisms, there is little or no information available on the toxicity of hydrocarbons or any chemical in the deep-sea. Although technical developments have reduced or removed discharges with hydrocarbons and other potentially damaging chemicals by transport to land or re-injection, accidental leaks and spills may occur. Moreover, we may benefit from knowledge-based options for assessing mitigation alternatives and for considering how much an effluent must be cleaned before it possibly can be discharged. Preliminary studies have indicated that high pressure may alter the partitioning of some hydrocarbons between oil, organisms, and water and hence influence effects in biota. Special adaptations in organisms to deep-sea life may possibly also make them vulnerable to industrial activities. It is thus uncertain to what extent knowledge gained in shallow water can be directly transferred to deep-sea environment for risk assessment and environmental monitoring. Recent environmental law regulations emphasize the importance of biological effects. To meet the management needs of the oil and gas industry for deep-sea exploration and production, we are developing an environmental effect and risk estimation methodology for decision-making, impact assessment, and monitoring organised within the Norwegian Deepwater Programme (NDP).

TI  - Significance of the oceanic CO2 sink for national carbon accounts
AB  - Background: Under the United Nations convention on the law of the sea (1982), each participating country maintains exclusive economic and environmental rights within the oceanic region extending 200 nm from its coastline, known as the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Although the ocean within each EEZ has a vast capacity to absorb anthropogenic CO2 and therefore potentially be used as a carbon sink, it is not mentioned within the Kyoto Protocol most likely due to inadequate quantitative estimates. Here, I use two methods to estimate the anthropogenic CO2 storage and uptake for a typically large EEZ (Australia). Results: Depending on whether the Antarctic territory is included I find that during the 1990s between 30-40% of Australia's fossil-fuel CO2 emissions were absorbed by its own EEZ. Conclusion: This example highlights the potential significance of the EEZ carbon sink for national carbon accounts. However, this 'natural anthropogenic CO2 sink' could be used as a disincentive for certain nations to reduce their anthropogenic CO2 emissions, which would ultimately dampen global efforts to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Since the oceanic anthropogenic CO2 sink has limited ability to be controlled by human activities, current and future international climate change policies should have an explicit 'EEZ' clause excluding its use within national carbon accounts.

TI  - Numerical Comparison of B20 Biodiesel and Petroleum Diesel in terms of Performance, Combustion, and Emission at Constant Speed
AB  - To achieve energy efficiency and emission reduction in the shipping sector use of alternative marine fuel is one of the programs implemented. This study on alternative fuels is an active response to increasingly stringent emission regulations and the limited supply of fossil fuels. In addition, an operational feasibility study is an important thing. The method used in this research is computational fluid dynamics to see how the engine performance, combustion, and emissions when using biodiesel B20 at a constant speed of 2200 Rpm compared to when using petroleum diesel. From the results of the numerical comparison study, the use of B20 compared to petroleum diesel, there was an increase in engine performance the level of fuel consumption was higher. The use of B20 causes CO and UHC emissions to decrease while NOx increases compared to petroleum diesel. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Renewable-Energy paradox in paradise: A case stuty of Hawaii
AB  - Hawaii is committed to replacing imported oil with indigenous, renewable energy resources to enhance the economic and environmental security of the state's citizens. A case study of Hawaii's fuel-energy balance by the end of the 21st century which features two scenarios, a 'Business-as-Usual' energy system, based on imported fossil fuels, and a 'Renewable-Energy' scenario, based on an alternative energy system consisting entirely of indigenous, renewable energy resources, is presented. In the year 2100, a projected total energy consumption of approximately 335 million gigajoules would be provided from a hypothetical renewable-energy system of approximately 13 gigawatts-electric of installed capacity. This system would feature methanol-from-biomass to meet liquid fuel requirements for surface transportation, industrial, commercial, and residential sectors; hydrogen via electrolysis in liquid form for air transportation and as a gaseous fuel for industrial purposes; and electricity generated from geothermal, ocean thermal, wind, and photovoltaic sources for all power applications. A comprehensive economic analysis, including capital costs, operating and maintenance costs, air pollution costs for the total fuel cycle of each energy system, and a local multiplier effect factor of 3Â·75 per dollar, indicates that between the years of 1987 and 2100 the 'Business-as-Usual' scenario will have expended approximately $600 billion (1986 US dollars), and the 'Renewable-Energy' scenario will have cost approximately $400 billion. By switching from imported fossil fuels to indigenous, renewable energy resources during this time period, Hawaii's citizens could save approximately $200 billion to help preserve paradise. Â© 1994.

TI  - A scrutiny study on wave energy potential and policy in TURKEY
AB  - Recently new and renewable energy sources began to become prominent as alternatives to fossil fuels. Among these are wind, solar, hydraulic, biomass, geothermal and wave energies. As for Turkey, the least accounted and less applied of these sources is wave energy. The government has established a short-term outlook on utilization of renewable energy sources, named "National Renewable Energy Action Plan" which is a part of Vision 2023 targets. Nonetheless, there is no planned utilization of and/or investment into wave energy in Turkey's agenda up to the year 2023. This might be mainly because of the complex structure of wave energy conversion systems, marine conditions, mechanical difficulties and high initial investment costs. However, this type of energy is environmentally friendly, cheap and clean, and a great potential is available especially in Turkey which is surrounded on three sides by sea. Although Turkey has neither coasts to oceans nor a long stretch of west coastline, which have the highest energetic waves thanks to the prevailing west-to-east winds; the Black Sea basin, as well as the south-western Mediterranean region, may offer a good potential for development as an energetic regime, often comparable to oceanic sites in terms of wave heights, induced by strong wind patterns. In this study, wave energy potential in Turkey and recent studies made on determination of suitable sites for evaluation of wave energy in Turkey are discussed.

TI  - Selecting Reliable and Robust Freshwater Macroalgae for Biomass Applications
AB  - Intensive cultivation of freshwater macroalgae is likely to increase with the development of an algal biofuels industry and algal bioremediation. However, target freshwater macroalgae species suitable for large-scale intensive cultivation have not yet been identified. Therefore, as a first step to identifying target species, we compared the productivity, growth and biochemical composition of three species representative of key freshwater macroalgae genera across a range of cultivation conditions. We then selected a primary target species and assessed its competitive ability against other species over a range of stocking densities. Oedogonium had the highest productivity (8.0 g ash free dry weight m(-2) day(-1)), lowest ash content (3-8\%), lowest water content (fresh weigh: dry weight ratio of 3.4), highest carbon content (45\%) and highest bioenergy potential (higher heating value 20 MJ/kg) compared to Cladophora and Spirogyra. The higher productivity of Oedogonium relative to Cladophora and Spirogyra was consistent when algae were cultured with and without the addition of CO2 across three aeration treatments. Therefore, Oedogonium was selected as our primary target species. The competitive ability of Oedogonium was assessed by growing it in bi-cultures and polycultures with Cladophora and Spirogyra over a range of stocking densities. Cultures were initially stocked with equal proportions of each species, but after three weeks of growth the proportion of Oedogonium had increased to at least 96\% (+/- 7 S.E.) in Oedogonium-Spirogyra bi-cultures, 86\% (+/- 16 S.E.) in Oedogonium-Cladophora bi-cultures and 82\% (+/- 18 S.E.) in polycultures. The high productivity, bioenergy potential and competitive dominance of Oedogonium make this species an ideal freshwater macroalgal target for large-scale production and a valuable biomass source for bioenergy applications. These results demonstrate that freshwater macroalgae are thus far an under-utilised feedstock with much potential for biomass applications.

AB  - Coral and Estrela do Mar are two oil fields located in Santos Basin, 180 km offshore Southeast Brazilian coast, in water depths of 150 m, that are being explored by a consortium composed by Petrobras, Queiroz GalvÃ£o PerfuraÃ§Ãµes, Starfish Oil & Gas and Coplex Petroleo do Brasil. The field exploration is based on a stationary oil production unit and on a floating storage and offloading unit. Based on a public BID, Petrobras, the leader of the consortium, selected the Brazilian operators Petroserv and Transpetro to provide a semi-submersible platform and a FSO and their operation respectively. Santos Basin area is a quite unexplored region in the South of Brazil with very few offshore resources. The key issue of the project was the very short time schedule available and the necessary high degree of confidentiability needed for the system due to absence of resources on the field vicinity combined to the fact that this area is located in the middle of an important ocean biological reservoir. This paper describes the engineering work performed for the development of the oil field that was based on the upgrade of the semi-submersible platform Atlantic Zephyr that received an oil process plant with 20,000 bpd capacity, a new helideck, new drain and firefighting systems, a flexible risers system, a ROV platform and stability blisters and on the conversion of the F.S.O AvarÃ©, a 28,000 dwt oil tanker that received an innovative DICAS mooring system, an oil import riser, a helideck, a new deck crane and an offloading system. Even being a low cost project, the development of Coral and Estrela do Mar meets some remarkable achievements. The short time required to start the oil production, the simplicity of the concepts used for the field development, the environmental aspects involved and the mooring systems using torpedo piles are some of the aspects that give to this field a very special position on the Brazilian oil industry.

TI  - Green energy from marine algae: Biogas production and composition from the anaerobic digestion of Irish seaweed species
AB  - Marine algae have emerged as an alternative feedstock for the production of a number of renewable fuels, including biogas. In addition to energy potential, other characteristics make them attractive as an energy source, including their ability to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2), higher productivity rates than land-based crops and the lack of water use or land competition. For Ireland, biofuels from marine algae can play an important role by reducing imports of fossil fuels as well as providing the necessary energy in rural communities. In this study, five potential seaweed species common in Irish waters, Saccorhiza polyschides, Ulva sp., Laminaria digitata, Fucus serratus and Saccharina latissima, were co-digested individually with bovine slurry. Batch reactors of 120 ml and 1000 ml were set up and incubated at 35Â°C to investigate their suitability for production of biogas. Digesters fed with S. latissima produced the maximum methane yield (335 ml g volatile solids -1 (gVS-1)) followed by S. polyschides with 255 ml gVS-1. L. digitata produced 246 ml gVS -1 and the lowest yields were from the green seaweed Ulva sp. 191 ml gVS-1. The methane and CO2 percentages ranged between 50-72% and 10-45%, respectively. The results demonstrated that the seaweed species investigated are good feedstocks candidates for the production of biogas and methane as a source of energy. Their use on a large-scale process will require further investigation to increase yields and reduce production costs. Â© 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis.

TI  - Marine Renewable Energy Seascape
AB  - ABSTRACT Energy production based on fossil fuel reserves is largely responsible for carbon emissions, and hence global warming. The planet needs concerted action to reduce fossil fuel usage and to implement carbon mitigation measures. Ocean energy has huge potential, but there are major interdisciplinary problems to be overcome regarding technology, cost reduction, investment, environmental impact, governance, and so forth. This article briefly reviews ocean energy production from offshore wind, tidal stream, ocean current, tidal range, wave, thermal, salinity gradients, and biomass sources. Future areas of research and development are outlined that could make exploitation of the marine renewable energy (MRE) seascape a viable proposition; these areas include energy storage, advanced materials, robotics, and informatics. The article concludes with a sustainability perspective on the MRE seascape encompassing ethics, legislation, the regulatory environment, governance and consenting, economic, social, and environmental constraints. A new generation of engineers is needed with the ingenuity and spirit of adventure to meet the global challenge posed by MRE. Â© 2016 THE AUTHORS

TI  - Carbon stocks and potential carbon storage in the mangrove forests ofChina
AB  - Mangrove forests provide important ecosystem services, and play important roles in terrestrial and oceanic carbon (C) cycling. Although the C stocks or storage in terrestrial ecosystems in China have been frequently assessed, the C stocks in mangrove forests have often been overlooked. In this study, we estimated the C stocks and the potential C stocks in China's mangrove forests by combining our own field data with data from the National Mangrove Resource Inventory Report and from other published literature. The results indicate that mangrove forests in China store about 6.91Â±0.57Tg C, of which 81.74% is in the top 1m soil, 18.12% in the biomass of mangrove trees, and 0.08% in the ground layer (i.e. mangrove litter and seedlings). The potential C stocks are as high as 28.81Â±4.16Tg C. On average, mangrove forests in China contain 355.25Â±82.19Mg Cha-1, which is consistent with the global average of mangrove C density at similar latitudes, but higher than the average C density in terrestrial forests in China. Our results suggest that C storage in mangroves can be increased by selecting high C-density species for afforestation and stand improvement, and even more by increasing the mangrove area. The information gained in this study will facilitate policy decisions concerning the restoration of mangrove forests in China. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Altered groundwater discharge and associated carbon fluxes in a wetland-drained coastal canal
AB  - Residential canal systems are becoming increasingly popular with the rising demand for absolute coastal waterfront properties. We hypothesize that canals alter groundwater-surface water connectivity and related carbon fluxes into coastal surface waters. Here, we quantified submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) in a residential canal system on Bribie Island (Australia) and associated carbon fluxes. SGD rates estimated from a radon (Rn-222) mass balance model were 3.1 +/- 1.5 cm d(-1). These fluxes delivered 68 +/- 44 and 70 +/- 48 mmol m(-2) d(-1) of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the canal, respectively. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to the atmosphere ranged from 15 to 28 mmol m(-2) d(-1). Multiple lines of evidence, including flux estimates and groundwater observations, converge to the conclusion that SGD was a major source of DOC and free CO2, but not carbonate alkalinity nor DIC to canal surface waters. In comparison to mangrove tidal creeks that often precede canals, the canal had (1) lower tidally-driven saline groundwater exchange rates but higher fresh groundwater discharge, (2) lower CO2 emissions to the atmosphere; and (3) acted as a driver rather than a buffer of local ocean acidification. These differences seem to be driven by the replacement of intertidal wetland vegetation with urban areas that prevent soil carbon accumulation and related biogeochemical processes around the canals. We suggest that decisions on canal construction should consider potential changes to groundwater-derived soil carbon losses and carbon cycling in receiving coastal waters.

TI  - Coastal protection through wave farms: Feasibility assessment using numerical wave modelling and parametric study
AB  - The Australian government has set a 23.5% target of renewable energy by the year 2020 as part of Australia's commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. CSIRO has recently produced an assessment of the ocean wave energy resource in Australia and identified the Southern Margin to be one of the most energetic areas worldwide suitable for the extraction of wave energy for electricity production. While most wave energy projects have been up to now based around single unit devices, recent projects and the long-term aim of this new industry includes deployment of multi-device wave farms, which introduces potential for such projects to provide additional benefits through coastal protection. Port Fairy, located on the southern coast of Victoria, is home to a wave energy pilot project with BioPower Systems (BPS) having deployed their bioWAVE device at the end of 2015. In the recent years, Port Fairy has also been the subject of multiple high-level coastal processes studies in order to gain a better understanding of present and future coastal hazards. This works aims to assess the potential for wave energy farms, comprising of a large number of wave energy converters (WEC) deployed in an array configuration, to provide coastal protection at the case study site of East Beach in Port Fairy. This assessment is performed using a modified version of an industry standard wave model (SWAN), which allows the incorporation of device-specific WEC characteristics to specify obstacle transmission. The SWAN model was calibrated against both nearshore (ADCP) and offshore (waverider buoys) wave records. The analysis investigated the influence of the number of WECs within the array on the reduction of the transmitted wave height in mild storm conditions, where WECs would be expected to operate.

TI  - Insight on zero waste approach for sustainable microalgae biorefinery: Sequential fractionation, conversion and applications for high-to-low value-added products
AB  - Microalgae, especially oleaginous species, have gained much attention as bioenergy feedstocks in response to uprising energy crisis, lessening natural resources, and climate change. Microalgae are also used to extract high value co-products such as pigments, vitamins, proteins, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, and carbohydrates, those are beneficial in various sectors. These benefits authorize microalgae as a promising source for biorefinery. The focus on zero waste approach would help promote sustainability of microalgal biorefinery. This review offers depiction of evolving zero waste and biorefinery concept for the cost/energy-effective and maintainable processes. Sequential fractionation of microalgal biomass into promising raw materials for biorefinery access and recent conversion technologies applied on microalgal biomass, are discussed. The applications for high-to-low value added-products including nutraceuticals/pharmaceuticals, food and feed, bioenergy and biofuels, and fertilizer are proposed. Key challenges for zero waste microalgae biorefinery are summarized. These strategies may greatly contribute to sustainability of microalgae-based bioproducts and biofuels. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - UK Macro-Algae Biofuels: A Strategic Management Review and Future Research Agenda
AB  - Macro-algae is increasingly gaining attention as a potential feedstock for biofuels and as a potential alternative fuel for aviation. Technological aspects are showing promise, and being examined more widely. This paper uses a strategic management perspective to complete an initial macro-environmental scan of the potential opportunities and threats to a seaweed biofuels industry. This is in response to calls to look beyond technological aspects, and highlights the importance of social acceptance. It is clear that very little is known about the potential economic, social, environmental and political/legal issues that might arise in the development of this industry. While we can look at the development of other, more established renewable technologies and seaweed industries away from the UK to highlight potential issues this does not give us a clear picture. Further research is needed to ensure that a proactive approach is used to research and inform stakeholders who will affect the further technological development and commercialization of the industry.

TI  - Detection and projection of carbonate dissolution in the water column and deep-sea sediments due to ocean acidification
AB  - Dissolution of fossil fuel CO2 in seawater results in decreasing carbonate ion concentration and lowering of seawater pH with likely negative impacts for many marine organisms. We project detectable changes in carbonate dissolution and evaluate their potential to mitigate atmospheric CO2 and ocean acidification with a global biogeochemistry model HAMOCC forced by different CO2 emission scenarios. Our results suggest that as the anthropogenic CO2 signal penetrates into ocean interior, the saturation state of carbonate minerals will drop drastically-with undersaturation extending from the ocean floor up to 100-150 m depth in the next century. This will induce massive dissolution of CaCO3 in the water column as well as the sediment, increasing the Total Alkalinity (TA) by up to 180 mol kg-1 at the surface and in the ocean interior over the next 2500 years. Model results indicate an inhomogeneous response among different ocean basins: Atlantic carbonate chemistry responds faster and starts recovering two millennia after CO2 emissions cease, which is not the case in the Pacific. CaCO3 rain stops in the Pacific Ocean around 2230. Using an observation-derived detection threshold for TA, we project detectable dissolution-driven changes only by the year 2070 in the surface ocean and after 2230 and 2500 in the deep Atlantic and Pacific respectively. We show that different model assumptions regarding dissolution and calcification rates have little impact on future projections. Instead, anthropogenic CO2 emissions overwhelmingly control the degree of perturbation in ocean chemistry. In conclusion, ocean carbonate dissolution has insignificant potential in mitigating atmospheric CO2 and ocean acidification in the next millennia. Copyright 2012 by the American Geophysical Union.

TI  - Ranking the risk of CO2 emissions from seagrass soil carbon stocks under global change threats
AB  - Seagrass meadows are natural carbon storage hotspots at risk from global change threats, and their loss can result in the remineralization of soil carbon stocks and CO2 emissions fueling climate change. Here we used expert elicitation and empirical evidence to assess the risk of CO2 emissions from seagrass soils caused by multiple human-induced, biological and climate change threats. Judgments from 41 experts were synthesized into a seagrass CO2 emission risk score based on vulnerability factors (i.e., spatial scale, frequency, magnitude, resistance and recovery) to seagrass soil organic carbon stocks. Experts perceived that climate change threats (e.g., gradual ocean warming and increased storminess) have the highest risk for CO2 emissions at global spatial scales, while direct threats (i.e., dredging and building of a marina or jetty) have the largest CO2 emission risks at local spatial scales. A review of existing peer-reviewed literature showed a scarcity of studies assessing CO2 emissions following seagrass disturbance, but the limited empirical evidence partly confirmed the opinion of experts. The literature review indicated that direct and long-term disturbances have the greatest negative impact on soil carbon stocks per unit area, highlighting that immediate management actions after disturbances to recover the seagrass canopy can significantly reduce soil CO2 emissions. We conclude that further empirical evidence assessing global change threats on the seagrass carbon sink capacity is required to aid broader uptake of seagrass into blue carbon policy frameworks. The preliminary findings from this study can be used to estimate the potential risk of CO2 emissions from seagrass habitats under threat and guide nature-based solutions for climate change mitigation.

TI  - Improving seawater desalination efficiency by solar driven interfacial evaporation based on biochar evaporator of Nannochloropsis oculata residue
AB  - Solar driven interfacial evaporation technologies have significant potential in seawater desalination, sewage purification and steam power generation applications. The interfacial evaporator is primarily composed of a solar absorption layer and a substrate for thermal insulation and water conveyance. However, the materials used in the solar absorption layer and substrate are typically expensive and difficult to produce, which is not conducive to large-scale application. Herein, a novel porous microalgae biochar solar interfacial evaporator (MBSIE) was developed for high-performance solar-driven water vapor generation. The solar absorption layer was synthesized with the residue of the microalgae species Nannochloropsis oculata, which was generated from the process of biodiesel production. The substrate was composed of polystyrene foam and absorbent cotton sticks with an optimized water channel design. The light absorptivity of porous Nannochloropsis oculata biochar reached 94.1\%, and the material contains hydrophilic groups such as C-O and N-H, which was conducive to water delivery. MBSIE attains a maximum seawater evaporation rate of 1.165 kg m(-2) h(-1) under one Sun irradiation intensity. The total dissolved solids and salinity of the produced fresh water was 265 mg L-1 and 0.06 parts per thousand, respectively. This quality of freshwater could meet domestic water standards.

TI  - Freshwater discharges drive high levels of methylmercury in Arctic marine biota
AB  - Elevated levels of neurotoxic methylmercury in Arctic food-webs pose health risks for indigenous populations that consume large quantities of marine mammals and fish. Estuaries provide critical hunting and fishing territory for these populations, and, until recently, benthic sediment was thought to be the main methylmercury source for coastal fish. New hydroelectric developments are being proposed in many northern ecosystems, and the ecological impacts of this industry relative to accelerating climate changes are poorly characterized. Here we evaluate the competing impacts of climate-driven changes in northern ecosystems and reservoir flooding on methylmercury production and bioaccumulation through a case study of a stratified sub-Arctic estuarine fjord in Labrador, Canada. Methylmercury bioaccumulation in zooplankton is higher than in midlatitude ecosystems. Direct measurements and modeling show that currently the largest methylmercury source is production in oxic surface seawater. Water-column methylation is highest in stratified surface waters near the river mouth because of the stimulating effects of terrestrial organic matter on methylating microbes. We attribute enhanced biomagnification in plankton to a thin layer of marine snow widely observed in stratified systems that concentrates microbial methylation and multiple trophic levels of zooplankton in a vertically restricted zone. Large freshwater inputs and the extensive Arctic Ocean continental shelf mean these processes are likely widespread and will be enhanced by future increases in water-column stratification, exacerbating high biological methylmercury concentrations. Soil flooding experiments indicate that near-term changes expected from reservoir creation will increase methylmercury inputs to the estuary by 25-200\%, over-whelming climate-driven changes over the next decade.

TI  - Evidence that offshore wind farms might affect marine sediment quality and microbial communities
AB  - Offshore wind power is a typical example of clean energy production and plays a critical role in achieving carbon neutrality. Offshore wind farms can have an impact on the marine environment, especially sedimentary environments, but their influence on sediments remain largely unknown. This study, which uses the control-impact principle to define different areas, investigated the characteristics of marine sediments under the Putidao offshore wind farm in Bohai Bay, China. We used chemical and microbiological observations to evaluate sediment quality and microbial community structure. According to both the geo-accumulation index (Igeo) and contamination factor (CF) indexes, copper, chromium and zinc were the major contaminants in the offshore wind farm sediments. The pollution load index (PLI) index showed that the various sites on the wind farm were only lightly polluted compared with baseline values. Closer to the wind farm's center, the metal concentrations started to rise. The physicochemical features of the sediments could better explain changes in the microorganisms present, and screening the microbiomes showed a correlation with heavy metal levels, linking the relative abundance of microorganisms to the sediment quality index. This comprehensive study fills a knowledge gap in China and adds to our understanding of how to assess the sedimentary environments of offshore wind farms. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Reconciling fisheries catch and ocean productivity
AB  - Photosynthesis fuels marine food webs, yet differences in fish catch across globally distributed marine ecosystems far exceed differences in net primary production (NPP). We consider the hypothesis that ecosystem-level variations in pelagic and benthic energy flows from phytoplankton to fish, trophic transfer efficiencies, and fishing effort can quantitatively reconcile this contrast in an energetically consistent manner. To test this hypothesis, we enlist global fish catch data that include previously neglected contributions from small-scale fisheries, a synthesis of global fishing effort, and plankton food web energy flux estimates from a prototype high-resolution global earth system model (ESM). After removing a small number of lightly fished ecosystems, stark interregional differences in fish catch per unit area can be explained (r = 0.79) with an energy-based model that (i) considers dynamic interregional differences in benthic and pelagic energy pathways connecting phytoplankton and fish, (ii) depresses trophic transfer efficiencies in the tropics and, less critically, (iii) associates elevated trophic transfer efficiencies with benthic-predominant systems. Model catch estimates are generally within a factor of 2 of values spanning two orders of magnitude. Climate change projections show that the same macroecological patterns explaining dramatic regional catch differences in the contemporary ocean amplify catch trends, producing changes that may exceed 50% in some regions by the end of the 21st century under high-emissions scenarios. Models failing to resolve these trophodynamic patterns may significantly underestimate regional fisheries catch trends and hinder adaptation to climate change.

Substantial new deployments of tidal barrages, essentially comprising hydroelectric technologies driven by seawater, are under evaluation or construction in a number of countries. Technologies for extraction of heat energy from seawater by Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) and submarine geothermal energy are being developed more slowly, as are technologies for harnessing energy from salinity gradients and production of bio-fuels from marine biomass.

TI  - Production of Bio-Diesel from marine macro algae
AB  - The world is entering a period of declining non-renewable energy resources popularly known as "Peak Oil". Climate change is therefore more than a problem with a feasible solution based either in science or markets on which we are likely to reach rapid consensus. Since the mid-20th century it has projected continuation. Earth is already showing many signs of worldwide climate change. One of the greatest challenges facing energy crisis is to replace the petroleum based diesel obtained from crude oil with more environmental friendly Bio-Diesel. Bio-Diesel is made from renewable resources, is bio-degradable and non-toxic and has a higher flash point than normal Diesel. Another significant advantage of Bio-Diesel is its low emission profile and also provides a means to recycle carbon-dioxide, thereby not contributing to global warming and climatic changes. Algal oil is an interesting sustainable feedstock for Bio-Diesel manufacturing. It is an alternative to popular feed stocks like soybean, canola and palm. Algae are the highest yielding feed stock for Bio-Diesel because of its high lipid content. Macro algae are multi cellular organisms which, like plants, use photosynthesis to convert the sun's energy into chemical energy. The viscosity of the raw oil has to be brought down by a suitable chemical process called transesterification, so that it can be used as an automobile fuel. It would be concluded that usage of Bio-diesel from algae would be a sustainable way to control of emission of green house gases in the atmosphere and there by controlling the drastic climatic changes. In this research, two macro algal species Gracilaria coticata and Chaetomorpha Antennina were studied for bio-diesel production and their results indicate that bio-diesel can be produced from both the species.

TI  - Kaolin-nucleation-based biotreated calcareous sand through unsaturated percolation method
AB  - Ocean development is an effective and practical way to address resource issues, such as food, fuel, and land shortage. The current work proposed using kaolin-based biocement to stabilize calcareous sand which is always the main component of the foundations of ocean engineering. Five kinds of kaolin concentrations (0 g/L, 10 g/L, 20 g/L, 50 g/L, and 100 g/L) were selected to stabilize calcareous sand via the unsaturated percolation method. Besides, the saturated strength was determined to mimic the practical situations. The results showed that treatment cycles and raw materials can be reduced to obtain a given saturated strength when moderate kaolin is added. That is, the cost-performance of the MICP is improved. Besides, the maximum attainable saturated strength can be enlarged when a small dosage of kaolin is added. The distribution of precipitate contents along with the height of the specimens was also determined by the buoyancy method. Furthermore, a critical permeability range, i.e., 1.11 similar to 2.70 x 10(-4) m/s, is also distinguished from the permeability tests. The percolation method is not suitable for sand with a permeability smaller than this range.

TI  - Growth, fatty acid, and lipid composition of marine microalgae skeletonema costatum available in Bangladesh coast: Consideration as biodiesel feedstock
AB  - Among the various potential sources of renewable energy, biofuels are of most interest. Marine microalgae are the most promising oil sources for making biofuels, which can grow very rapidly and convert solar energy to chemical energy via CO2 fixation. The fatty acid profile of almost all the microalgal oil is suitable for the synthesis of biofuel. In this research, fatty acid and lipid contents of Bangladeshi strains of marine microalgae Skeletonema costatum were performed. For this, the crude oil was extracted by Soxhlet extraction method, using three most common solvent systems, pure hexane and mixture of CHCl3: MeOH (2: 1) and hexane: EtOH (3: 1) one by one. Highest oil recovery (15.37%) came from CHCl3: MeOH (2: 1) solvent system from dry biomass whereas the lowest (2.49%) came from n-hexane from wet biomass. The qualitative analysis of the extracted oil by GC/MS analysis revealed that it contained significant amount of myristic acid (C14:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), and palmitoleic acid (C16:1). It also indicated presence of hexadecatrienoic acid, benzenedicarboxylic acid, oleic acid, arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), 9-Octadecenoic acid methyl ester (C19H36O2), and so forth. The obtained fatty acid profile indicates high potentiality of S. costatum species to be used as promising biofuel feedstock a little improvisation and substantially it can replace diesel in near future.

TI  - Indonesia's blue carbon: a globally significant and vulnerable sink for seagrass and mangrove carbon
AB  - The global significance of carbon storage in Indonesia's coastal wetlands was assessed based on published and unpublished measurements of the organic carbon content of living seagrass and mangrove biomass and soil pools. For seagrasses, median above- and below-ground biomass was 0.29 and 1.13 Mg C ha(-1) respectively; the median soil pool was 118.1 Mg C ha(-1). Combining plant biomass and soil, median carbon storage in an Indonesian seagrass meadow is 119.5 Mg C ha(-1). Extrapolated to the estimated total seagrass area of 30,000 km(2), the national storage value is 368.5 Tg C. For mangroves, median above- and below-ground biomass was 159.1 and 16.7 Mg C ha(-1), respectively; the median soil pool was 774.7 Mg C ha(-1). The median carbon storage in an Indonesian mangrove forest is 950.5 Mg C ha(-1). Extrapolated to the total estimated mangrove area of 31,894 km(2), the national storage value is 3.0 Pg C, a likely underestimate if these habitats sequester carbon at soil depths > 1 m and/or sequester inorganic carbon. Together, Indonesia's seagrasses and mangroves conservatively account for 3.4 Pg C, roughly 17 \% of the world's blue carbon reservoir. Continued degradation and destruction of these wetlands has important consequences for CO2 emissions and dissolved carbon exchange with adjacent coastal waters. We estimate that roughly 29,040 Gg CO2 (eq.) is returned annually to the atmosphere-ocean pool. This amount is equivalent to about 3.2 \% of Indonesia's annual emissions associated with forest and peat land conversion. These results highlight the urgent need for blue carbon and REDD+ projects as a means to stem the decline in wetland area and to mitigate the release of a significant fraction of the world's coastal carbon stores.

TI  - Field testing of multiple sensors in an underwater environment monitoring system
AB  - This paper presents an underwater environment monitoring system, which is designed for deployment with a meteorological mast in the offshore wind farm. The factors of safety, reliable, and extendable capacity are the major design concept. First of all, the demonstration project of the offshore wind farms at Taiwan is going to build three pilot wind farms and meteorological masts. The measurement of ocean environment is included sea surface wave, sea current, sea surface level, sea temperature and salinity. Thus, the instruments of wave gauge, acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP), and conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) are required for the demonstration project. Moreover, the data collection of environmental impact assessment needs underwater noise meters and ocean bottom seismometer, which are also included in the underwater environment monitoring system. Based on the measurement quality and safety, a seabed mounted frame is used for protection all instruments. The overall weight is about 100 kg in air and about 60 kg in water. The underwater environment monitoring system has an underwater junction box that is a node to integrate for power supply and data transmitting of five instruments. The electric power and digital signals are transmitted by a hybrid cable in 150 m long within four pins copper conductors and two optical-fiber cables. The power loss rate in the copper conductors is about 5.025 ohm/km with the power supply of 220 VAC and 0.55 A. The power convertor in the junction box is AC-to-DC, which has input power of 100-240 VAC and output power of 12/48 VDC. The optical-fiber cable transmits the digital data via single-mode with a bandwidth over 156 Mbps, which is required by the underwater noise data with bandwidths from 80 kbps to 2.4 Mbps. The field testing had two stages, which were in a water tank and in the harbor over ten days. The preliminary testing tasks in a water tank were the correct rate of data collection and reliability of system operation. The sea trial task was deployed the underwater environment monitoring system in a water depth of 8-9 m at Kaohsiung Harbor. The results had reported the system reliability, the ocean environmental states, and the underwater noises in Kaohsiung Harbor. Moreover, the surface of the stainless steel frame and the aluminum alloy housing were weakened due to the corrosion and biofouling, which indicated more robust materials and anti-corrosion coating are demanded in the future.

TI  - Faunal mediated carbon export from mangroves in an arid area
AB  - The outwelling paradigm argues that mangrove and saltmarsh wetlands export much excess production to downstream marine systems. However, outwelling is difficult to quantify and currently 40â€“50% of fixed carbon is unaccounted for. Some carbon is thought outwelled through mobile fauna, including fish, which visit and feed on mangrove produce during tidal inundation or early life stages before moving offshore, yet this pathway for carbon outwelling has never been quantified. We studied faunal carbon outwelling in three arid mangroves, where sharp isotopic gradients across the boundary between mangroves and down-stream systems permitted spatial differentiation of source of carbon in animal tissue. Stable isotope analysis (C, N, S) revealed 22â€“56% of the tissue of tidally migrating fauna was mangrove derived. Estimated consumption rates showed that 1.4% (38 kg C haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1) of annual mangrove litter production was directly consumed by migratory fauna, with &lt;1% potentially exported. We predict that the amount of faunally-outwelled carbon is likely to be highly correlated with biomass of migratory fauna. While this may vary globally, the measured migratory fauna biomass in these arid mangroves was within the range of observations for mangroves across diverse biogeographic ranges and environmental settings. Hence, this study provides a generalized prediction of the relatively weak contribution of faunal migration to carbon outwelling from mangroves and the current proposition, that the unaccounted-for 40â€“50% of mangrove C is exported as dissolved inorganic carbon, remains plausible.

TI  - Renewable CO2 recycling and synthetic fuel production in a marine environment
AB  - A massive reduction in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning is required to limit the extent of global warming. However, carbon-based liquid fuels will in the foreseeable future continue to be important energy storage media. We propose a combination of largely existing technologies to use solar energy to recycle atmospheric CO2 into a liquid fuel. Our concept is clusters of marine-based floating islands, on which photovoltaic cells convert sunlight into electrical energy to produce H2 and to extract CO2 from seawater, where it is in equilibrium with the atmosphere. These gases are then reacted to form the energy carrier methanol, which is conveniently shipped to the end consumer. The present work initiates the development of this concept and highlights relevant questions in physics, chemistry, and mechanics. Â© 2019 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

TI  - Potential microbial functional activity along a Posidonia oceanica soil profile
AB  - Among the ecosystem services provided by the seagrass Posidonia oceanica, its role as a carbon sink has received growing attention during the last decade. The sequestration and stabilization of carbon in soils are tightly linked to the activity of its microbial community. EcoPlates (Biolog) comprise a semi-quantitative tool for the assessment of microbial functional activity that generates profiles of microbial carbon source utilization. In this study, the aerobic and anaerobic carbon consumption in a healthy P. oceanica meadow was compared throughout depths down to 130 cm. After 11 d, the average well color development, Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H'), and kinetics of carbon consumption were assessed. Both the aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms showed carbon consumption at all depths. Color observations indicated that carbohydrates, amino acids and polymers were mainly consumed, while carboxylic acids, amines and miscellaneous compounds presented low or no consumption at all. Carbon consumption kinetics were similar for both metabolisms. The results suggest a pronounced stratification of the microbial community controlled by oxygen availability. Despite the higher aerobic metabolism in the top 40 cm, the anaerobic metabolism was dominant, supporting high sequestration of carbon in P. oceanica meadows.

TI  - CO2 efflux from cleared mangrove peat
AB  - Mangroves are being cleared at a rapid rate, exceeding that of tropical forests [1], [2]. Clearing of above-ground biomass in mangrove forests results in changes in ecosystem processes [3] and losses of ecosystem services, including fisheries and storm protection [4], [5]. Additionally, clearing of forests reduces carbon sequestration and may lead to CO2 emissions due to loss of aboveground carbon stocks and increased rates of soil decomposition [6]. In terrestrial ecosystems land-use change is one of the major sources of CO2 emissions above the burning of fossil fuels [7]. In the tropics clearing of rainforests has led to high levels of CO2 emissions [8] which have made these forests particularly valuable for conservation schemes developed to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and to enhance carbon storage (REDD and REDD+) [9], [10], [11]. Similar schemes are proposed for carbon rich marine ecosystems, including mangroves, but there are many uncertainties around factors influencing carbon sequestration and carbon stocks in these coastal systems [12], [13].

TI  - A Research on the Application and Calculation of Wind Energy
AB  - Nowadays, due to the serious shortage of energy resource, the research and application of new alternative energy has become an important task for each country and government all over the world. In order to protect environment and raise the utilization of marine power, Maritime Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) of International Maritime Organization (IMO) encouraged ship operators to use new alternative energies to reduce marine CO2 emission. Currently, marine new energy technologies mainly include solar energy, wind energy, waste heat recovery and biological substitute fuel. Wind energy, as a clean and easy getting energy, has been paid a high attention to. This paper mainly introduces the basic features and calculation of wind energy, and then put forwards some shortcomings in the application of it on the ships.

TI  - Characterization and improvement of oxygen reducing cathodes in undersea power systems
AB  - Power sources for marine systems are becoming more versatile, taking advantage several different electrochemical couples to provide energy in locations that are not serviced by conventional electrical loads. Renewable power from wind, solar, and tidal power continues to dominate power generation at the ocean surface. In sub-surface locations, primary batteries and sealed secondary battery systems are often used. More recently, microbial fuel cells are being testing to support undersea sensors and electronics. Both battery and fuel cell systems must take advantage of electrochemical differences in order to generate voltage and current. Typically, these systems operate with an oxygen reducing cathode that is paired with an oxidation reaction at the anode. Both aluminum and magnesium have been used in primary battery systems in underwater systems. Under standard conditions, theoretical cell voltages provided by aluminum and magnesium can be calculated to be 1.26V and 1.97V respectively (comparable to a typical alkaline battery cell at 1.5V). Similarly, theoretical voltages for sediment microbial fuel cells have been estimated on the order of 1V based on standard conditions. These theoretical voltages do not account for losses or differences due to environmental conditions, transport, electrodes, or cell design. Engineering these systems to minimize losses can focus on many different aspects of system design. We focus here on the cathode, in part because improvements in oxygen reduction could be applicable to both abiotic metal battery systems as well as the biological fuel cell system. Our approach here is to analyze the performance of the cathode using electrochemical and molecular biology techniques. Employing these techniques is important to obtain a more complete understanding of the cathode because of the typical biomass growth that must be accounted for on exposed electrode surfaces. In most prototype systems, cathode materials use inert materials such as carbon or stainless steel. In this study, we look at three common-place carbon materials, graphite plates, graphite fiber brushes, and carbon cloth, and their performance as cathode substrates in undersea power systems. A major driving force behind this study was the availability of these materials for large scale applications in the future. Additional consideration was given to past use in published field studies with primary batteries (aluminum, magnesium) or in microbial fuel cell systems. For this reason, we report here the performance of undersea cathodes through operation and electrochemical testing in a sediment microbial fuel cell system. The effect of oxygen concentration on performance was evaluated and a minimum dissolved oxygen concentration of about 3 mg/L was determined for proper function at cathodes. Electrochemical studies indicate two distinct processes taking place at the cathode surface. We also take an exploratory look at the microbial community supported on each of these materials. An examination of typical cathode microbial communities offers some mechanisms that could be used to improve abiotic cathodes through use of metal catalysts based on iron or manganese. Preliminary tests of manganese coatings indicated possible improvements in operating voltage and sustainable current density. Â© 2017 Marine Technology Society.

TI  - The solar power: A brief review of renewable energy potential in the world of limited resources
AB  - Economic development and sustainability debate often centers on the question of renewable energy. Renewables include hydropower, solar thermal, solar photovoltaic, geothermal power, wind power, biogas, solid and liquid biomass, tidal power, wave power, ocean thermal gradients, as well as organic and inorganic waste material. Sometimes, nuclear energy is also classified as a renewable. Virtually all these renewable sources, with the exception of tidal power and geothermal energy, are directly or indirectly the result of solar insolation, as biomass is largely dependent on sunlight. This article will explore the history and implications of use of solar power at the time of limited natural resources and the threat of climate change. Â© 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.
