TI  - Global CO2 recycling
AB  - Effective electrodes for electrolysis of seawater for production of hydrogen (H2) ~without releasing chlorine into atmosphere and catalysts for production of methane (CH4~) by the reaction of carbon dioxide (CO2) with H2 have been tailored. Using these novel materials a CO2 recycling plant for substantiation of our proposal has been built on the roof of Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University. The CO2 recycling plant consists of a desert, a coast close to the desert and an energy consuming district. At the desert electricity is generated by solar cell operation and transmitted to the coast close to the desert. At the coast H2 is produced by electrolysis of seawater using the electricity, and then CH4 is formed by the reaction of H2 and CO2. CH4 is transported to the energy consuming district. At the energy consuming district combustion of CH4 is carried out not by air but by O2 and CO2 is recovered after removing H2O from the exhaust gas composed only of CO2 and H2O. The recovered CO2 is sent again to the coast close to the desert for reproduction of CH4. The CO2 recycling plant has substantiated that the solar energy at the desert can be used by energy consumers in the form of CH4 without emitting CO2 into atmosphere.

TI  - Hysteresis of the Earth system under positive and negative CO2 emissions
AB  - Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere is part of all emission scenarios of the IPCC that limit global warming to below 1.5 degrees C. Here, we investigate hysteresis characteristics in 4x pre-industrial atmospheric CO2 concentration scenarios with exponentially increasing and decreasing CO2 using the Bern3D-LPX Earth system model of intermediate complexity. The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and the rate of CDR are systematically varied. Hysteresis is quantified as the difference in a variable between the up and down pathway at identical cumulative carbon emissions. Typically, hysteresis increases non-linearly with increasing ECS, while its dependency on the CDR rate varies across variables. Large hysteresis is found for global surface air temperature (Delta SAT), upper ocean heat content, ocean deoxygenation, and acidification. We find distinct spatial patterns of hysteresis: Delta SAT exhibits strong polar amplification, hysteresis in O-2 is both positive and negative depending on the interplay between changes in remineralization of organic matter and ventilation. Due to hysteresis, sustained negative emissions are required to return to and keep a CO2 and warming target, particularly for high climate sensitivities and the large overshoot scenario considered here. Our results suggest, that not emitting carbon in the first place is preferable over carbon dioxide removal, even if technologies would exist to efficiently remove CO2 from the atmosphere and store it away safely.

TI  - Research and Adaptability Analysis on Acid Gas Removing Technology in Floating LNG Plant
AB  - Associated gas in offshore oil field is a kind of clean and efficient energy resource. Institute of Cryogenics and Superconductivity Technology at HIT has developed a floating LNG liquefaction plant for the associated gas. Based on the offshore oil field associated gas characteristics and the reaction mechanism between amine solutions and CO2, the CO2 removal process using MDEA+MEA aqueous solutions and its flow diagram are given. It analyses the adaptability of the CO2 removal cycle on the offshore oil associated-gas flux and CO2 content in the feed gas. The analysis result shows that the circulating amount of amine solutions should be 500kmol/h similar to 200kmol/h and the reboiler heat load should be 600kW similar to 200kW, when the CO2 mole fraction is 0.45\%similar to 5.54\% in the associated gas, and the capacity of the purification system is 11.6x10(4) Nm(3)/d. The result provides guidelines for the design and operation of the small-scale floating LNG liquefaction device.

TI  - Climate system response to solar radiation modification [IPCC AR6 æŠ¥å‘Šè§£è¯»:æ°”å€™ç³»ç»Ÿå¯¹å¤ªé˜³è¾å°„å¹²é¢„å“åº”.cn]
AB  - The IPCC recently released the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). The Working Group I contribution to the AR6 â€œClimate change 2021: the physical science basisâ€ addresses the most up-to-date physical understanding of the climate system and climate change. Climate system and the carbon cycle response to solar radiation modification (SRM) is assessed in this report. SRM can be considered as a potential supplement to deep emission reduction to counteract anthropogenic climate change. All assessment of climate effect from SRM are from modeling work. Key AR6 assessment relevant to SRM are: SRM could offset some of the effects from increasing greenhouse gases on global and regional climate (high confidence), but there would be substantial residual or overcompensating climate change at the regional scales and seasonal time scales (virtually certain). It is possible to stabilize multiple large-scale temperature indicators simultaneously by tailoring the deployment strategy of SRM options (medium confidence). A sudden and sustained termination of SRM in a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario would cause rapid climate change (high confidence), but a gradual phase out of SRM combined with emissions reductions and carbon dioxide removal would avoid large rates of changes (medium confidence). The cooling caused by SRM would increase the global land and ocean CO2 sinks (medium confidence), but SRM would not mitigate ocean acidification (high confidence). Our understanding of climate response to aerosol-based SRM options including stratospheric aerosol injection, marine cloud brightening, and cirrus cloud thinning is limited due to large uncertainties associated with aerosolâ€“cloudâ€“radiation interactions.

TI  - Enrichment of Marinobacter sp. and Halophilic Homoacetogens at the Biocathode of Microbial Electrosynthesis System Inoculated With Red Sea Brine Pool
AB  - Homoacetogens are efficient CO2 fixing bacteria using H2 as electron donor to produce acetate. These organisms can be enriched at the biocathode of microbial electrosynthesis (MES) for electricity-driven CO2 reduction to acetate. Studies exploring homoacetogens in MES are mainly conducted using pure or mix-culture anaerobic inocula from samples with standard environmental conditions. Extreme marine environments host unique microbial communities including homoacetogens that may have unique capabilities due to their adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. Anaerobic deep-sea brine pools are hypersaline and metalliferous environments and homoacetogens can be expected to live in these environments due to their remarkable metabolic flexibility and energy-efficient biosynthesis. However, brine pools have never been explored as inocula for the enrichment of homacetogens in MES. Here we used the saline water from a Red Sea brine pool as inoculum for the enrichment of halophilic homoacetogens at the biocathode (âˆ’1 V vs. Ag/AgCl) of MES. Volatile fatty acids, especially acetate, along with hydrogen gas were produced in MES systems operated at 25 and 10% salinity. Acetate concentration increased when MES was operated at a lower salinity âˆ¼3.5%, representing typical seawater salinity. Amplicon sequencing and genome-centric metagenomics of matured cathodic biofilm showed dominance of the genus Marinobacter and phylum Firmicutes at all tested salinities. Seventeen high-quality draft metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were extracted from the biocathode samples. The recovered MAGs accounted for 87 Â± 4% of the quality filtered sequence reads. Genome analysis of the MAGs suggested CO2 fixation via Woodâ€“Ljundahl pathway by members of the phylum Firmicutes and the fixed CO2 was possibly utilized by Marinobacter sp. for growth by consuming O2 escaping from the anode to the cathode for respiration. The enrichment of Marinobacter sp. with homoacetogens was only possible because of the specific cathodic environment in MES. These findings suggest that in organic carbon-limited saline environments, Marinobacter spp. can live in consortia with CO2 fixing bacteria such as homoacetogens, which can provide them with fixed carbon as a source of carbon and energy.

TI  - Cost of decreasing power plant carbon dioxide emissions
AB  - This paper reports the results of an economic evaluation of the cost of removing CO2 from power plant flue gas for subsequent disposal. The removal technologies described in this paper are monoethanol amine (MEA) scrubbing, combustion in mixtures of CO2 and O2, and CO2 removal from coal gasification combined cycle power plants. The concentrated CO2 is liquified and disposed of in the ocean at 500 meters depth. This study shows that CO2 removal and disposal will significantly reduce the power plant net thermal efficiency. The capital cost of the three CO2 removal systems are $387 - $953/kW (gross). The power plant operating costs will also increase. In terms of the cost per ton of CO2 removed, the removal costs range from $16-$54/ton of CO2 collected. Disposal costs are approximately $6.56 per ton. For new low CO2 power plants, the cost of electricity (including power generation and CO2 removal and disposal) ranges between $.10 /kWh (CGCC) to $$0.19 /kWh (Scrubbing). These results show that the cost of CO2 emission control for utility coal-fired boilers will be expensive and could more than double the cost of delivered electricity compared to a plant with no CO2 controls. The resulting thermal efficiency penalty is important; retrofitting a coal-fired power plant can cause a significant decrease in generating capacity. The scrubbing processes are each commercial and proven. Although the combustion in mixtures of CO2 and oxygen appears to be very attractive, the process is developmental and may ultimately cost more than is indicated by this preliminary study.

TI  - Humidity-resistant triboelectric nanogenerator and its applications in wind energy harvesting and self-powered cathodic protection
AB  - The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a novel energy harvesting strategy to convert various types of mechanical energy into electrical energy through the synergistic effect of triboelectrification and electrostatic induction. A hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) flexible film was introduced to establish a wind-driven TENG as the power supply for a self-powered cathodic protection (CP) system. The PTFE flexible film was used as the friction layer with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) film to generate charges. The developed triboelectric charges were transferred to the cathodic protection system. The PTFE-based flexible TENG exhibits enhanced output performance with an optimized short current of 29.72 mu A, an output voltage of 695.18 V, and an optimized power of 1.74 mW at 95\% RH (Relative Humidity). Besides, through the external connection to the protected metal, the PTFE-based flexible TENG established the power supply of the self-powered anticorrosion system. In the electrochemical measurements, an apparent open circuit potential drop (OCP) of 590 mV was achieved for the carbon steel connected with the wind-driven TENG, and the charge transfer resistance was also significantly reduced. Due to the high performance of the flexible TENG under high humidity, this smart self-powered system could effectively collect wind energy in the marine environment and prevent metal corrosion in marine facilities by converting wind power.

TI  - Mass Transfer Performance Study for CO2 Absorption into Non-Precipitated Potassium Carbonate Promoted with Glycine Using Packed Absorption Column
AB  - The removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) at offshore operation requires an absorption system with an environmentally friendly solvent that can operate at elevated pressure. Potassium carbonate promoted with glycine, PCGLY, is a green solvent that has potential for offshore applications. For high solvent concentrations at elevated pressure, the by-product of CO2 absorption consists of precipitates that increase operational difficulty. Therefore, this study was done to assess the CO2 absorption performance of non-precipitated PCGLY with concentration 15wt\%PC+3wt\%GLY, which is known to have comparable solubility performance with MDEA. A packed absorption column was used to identify the CO2 removal efficiency, mass transfer coefficient in liquid film, <mml:semantics>klae,</mml:semantics> and overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient, <mml:semantics>KGav</mml:semantics>. A simplified rate-based model was used to determine <mml:semantics>klae</mml:semantics> and <mml:semantics>KGav</mml:semantics> based on the experimental data with a maximum MAE value, 0.057. The results showed that liquid flow rates and liquid temperature gives significant effects on the <mml:semantics>klae</mml:semantics> and <mml:semantics>KGav</mml:semantics> profile, whereas gas flow rate and operating pressure had little effect. The CO2 removal efficiency of PCGLY was found to be 77\%, which was only 2\% lower than 1.2 kmol/m(3) MDEA. <mml:semantics>KGav</mml:semantics> of PCGLY is comparable with MDEA. The absorption process using PCGLY shows potential in the CO2 sweetening process at offshore.

TI  - Design and Simulation of Ammonia-Fueled SOFC-ICE Hybrid Power System for Ship Application
AB  - Increasingly stringent emission limits and carbon reduction needs of the shipping industry have forced shipowners and builders to look for alternative fuels and related power technology. Using ammonia to fuel solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems is one of the most efficient and environment-friendly technology options for the marine power. Considering the efficient utilization of exhaust gas and the effective integration of hybrid system, the combination of SOFC and other power technologies can achieve higher efficiency. In view of the current promotion of low-carbon/zero carbon fuel in the maritime industry and the integration of efficient and stable complementary SOFC and internal combustion engine (ICE) hybrid, it will be applied on ships in the future. Therefore, this paper designed an ammonia-fueled SOFC-ICE hybrid system for all-electric ship application. Based on MATLAB/SIMULINL, the steady-state electrochemical model of SOFC and the look-up table model of ICE about load were established. It is found that the electric efficiency of the ammonia ICE can reach about 30%. Based on a typical oil tanker, the ammonia-fueled SOFC-ICE hybrid power system achieves an electrical efficiency of 46.6% when the installed power density of the ammonia-fueled SOFC is 0.3 W/cm2 and the SOFC/ICE power ratio is 70-30.

TI  - Seawater usable for production and consumption of hydrogen peroxide as a solar fuel
AB  - Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) in water has been proposed as a promising solar fuel instead of gaseous hydrogen because of advantages on easy storage and high energy density, being used as a fuel of a one-compartment H 2 O 2 fuel cell for producing electricity on demand with emitting only dioxygen (O 2) and water. It is highly desired to utilize the most earth-abundant seawater instead of precious pure water for the practical use of H 2 O 2 as a solar fuel. Here we have achieved efficient photocatalytic production of H 2 O 2 from the most earth-abundant seawater instead of precious pure water and O 2 in a two-compartment photoelectrochemical cell using WO 3 as a photocatalyst for water oxidation and a cobalt complex supported on a glassy-carbon substrate for the selective two-electron reduction of O 2. The concentration of H 2 O 2 produced in seawater reached 48 mM, which was high enough to operate an H 2 O 2 fuel cell.

TI  - Optimization of the Cathodic Protection Design in Consideration of the Temperature Variation for Offshore Structures
AB  - The temperature effect on the current density which closely related to cathodic protection (CP) design was examined using electrochemical tests. A case study of an optimized CP design for the floating production storage and offloading using a computational analysis tool was also performed. The electrochemical test results showed that the current density and the surface resistance of the specimen (EH36) at 28 degrees C are lower and higher, respectively, compared with the 5 degrees C condition; this phenomenon is the result of a calcareous deposit that was verified by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy surface analyses. The polarization curves which contained the effect of calcareous deposits according to the temperature were used as the computational analysis input data. The simulation results showed that the structure under the 5 degrees C condition did not satisfy the CP criteria (-800 mV(SCE) to -1,050 mV(SCE) ) at the bottom shell and the mooring chain. It had higher potential than -800 mV(SCE) . Although the structure at 28 degrees C satisfied the protective potential range, it was sufficiently unstable for the prediction of the corrosion damage. To optimize and resolve the identified problems, the CP design was changed by CP methods, anodes quantities, and anodes distribution. Consequently, the structure at 5 degrees C is sufficient for the satisfaction of the protective-potential criteria (< -800 mV(SCE) ) at the bottom shell and the mooring chain. In the case of the structure at 28 degrees C, a more-even potential distribution was achieved.

TI  - Carbon dioxide removal rate by aeration devices in marine fish tanks
AB  - A procedure for measuring the transfer coefficient K(L)a for the removal rate of carbon dioxide by aeration devices in fish tanks was developed in the National Center for Mariculture in Eilat, Israel. The K(L)a for a paddlewheel and a submerged aerator were calculated, following experiments in which the aeration devices were used simultaneously for both carbon dioxide stripping and oxygenation. The paddlewheel was more efficient, with a transfer rate up to 1,200 g CO2 per hour and a stripping efficiency of 1.2 kg CO2 per kWh. In intensive sea bream culture, the calculated maximum feed load that a single paddlewheel aerator can support is 43.6 kg feed per day with an energy requirement of about 1.0 kWh per kg fish produced.

TI  - Challenges in offshore natural gas processing
AB  - The Brazilian offshore pre-salt cluster is one of the most important recent discoveries of hydrocarbon resources in the world. These fields normally present high CO2 content (more than 10%) and also high Gas Oil Ratio (GOR), thus might limit the oil production in the convention FPSOs project due to the capacity and complexity of gas processing plant. These conditions lead to application of alternative processes for gas treatment in offshore environment, such as molecular sieve for dehydration, fixed bed for H2S removal and CO2 removal membranes. Besides, due to high flow and high pressure drop involved in the treatment section, an increase in the number of equipment, such as compressors, heat exchangers and scrubbers are needed in order to reach high pressure values necessary for the CO2 reinjection into production zones for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). proposes. This objective will also contribute to increase complexity on the gas processing plant since it must deal with expected variations in GOR and CO2 content in natural gas during field lifetime. Petrobras and partners have been working, since 2008, with the objective to increase performance of existing processing and compression technologies and also supporting application of new ones (technological gaps) that can result in overall improvements in CAPEX and OPEX, such as: nano-sized zeolites for dehydration, new metal oxides for H2S removal with high capacity under influence of CO2, new material for membranes (ceramic and carbon tubes) and dense phase CO2 separation. The aim of the combined use of such iniatives is footprint and weight reduction, higher efficiency, less energy consumption with modular design. The purpose of this paper is to present the actual strategy for developing offshore gas process in Brazil, emphasizing the different technological gaps identified and the consequential road maps that are being pursued for the new units to be designed.

TI  - Innovative gas treatment solutions for offshore systems
AB  - Libra Area has presented gas/oil ratio (GOR) and CO2 content higher than the typically found in other Pre-Salt fields. These characteristics can significantly increase the size and complexity of the gas processing plant (GPP), especially in gas export scenarios. More efficient gas treatment technologies and with the ability to handle high CO2 levels need to be developed to reduce footprint and weight, improving oil plant capacity. This paper presents two membrane technologies selected for evaluation: Carbon Molecular Sieve (CMS), a partnership with Shell focused on CO2 removal, and All Membrane Solution (AMSTM), a commercial Air Liquide solution that can optimize the GPP layout by replacing conventional processes used for contaminants removal. AMS aims to remove, not only CO2, but also other contaminants such as H2S, H2O, and heavy hydrocarbons. Both technologies promise to lower the CAPEX and OPEX while increasing the oil production capacity, leading to more economically attractive projects. The demonstrations will be carried out at Atalaia Experimental Nucleus (NEAT), which is a Petrobras' center for gas technology assessment, located in Aracaju city, Brazil. Pilot-scale skids operating under Libra typical gas conditions will be used for technology assessment. CMS and AMS will be tested sequentially, the former expected to start in the second half of 2019 and the latter in the first half of 2020. For CMS technology, further tests on an industrial-scale prototype will still be needed afterwards, whereas for AMS, due to its higher technology readiness level (TRL), it is expected that it can be implemented just after the demonstration.

TI  - Natural gas pressurized liquefaction process adopting MR refrigeration and CO2 removal by anti-sublimation
AB  - Space limitation is one of the main challenges for the offshore natural gas liquefaction plants. Because of higher solubility of CO2 in warmer liquid, the pressurized liquefied natural gas (PLNG) process characterized by a high LNG product pressure (1âˆ¼2 MPa) was developed to liquefy natural gas without the help of CO2 removing unit. However, this technology only provided a solution for natural gas with CO2 content up to approximately 0.5%. In this paper, a novel PLNG process is proposed to deal with natural gas containing much more CO2. In this process, natural gas with adequate pressure is cooled by a refrigeration cycle with mixed refrigerant (MR). During the cooling process, solid CO2 forms in a crystallizer. The operation pressure is carefully chosen to ensure that CO2 anti-sublimation rather than CO2/CH4 mixture condensation takes place. Natural gas leaves the crystallizer with CO2 content about 0.5%. To avoid CO2 freeze-out in the later process, the low CO2-containing natural gas is then compressed to a higher pressure and finally liquefied in the following heat exchangers. By removing solid CO2 from the crystallizer, the proposed process achieves both LNG as the main product and dry-ice as a by-product. Taking specific power consumption as an index, the process is simulated and optimized at different CO2 contents, and the influences of several key parameters are analyzed. The results indicate that the proposed PLNG process is more energy-efficient than conventional LNG process as CO2 content varying from 0.5% to 20%. With a smaller footprint and a lower energy penalty, the proposed PLNG process is very suitable for offshore natural gas liquefaction.

TI  - Multi-criteria analyses of two solvent and one low-temperature concepts for acid gas removal from natural gas
AB  - This paper evaluates three acid gas removal concepts studied in the project "A Green Sea". Two solvent concepts (aMDEA/MDEA and Selexol) and a low-temperature concept are modelled and assessed, taking different raw natural gases and natural gas product requirements into consideration. The analyses and comparisons of the concepts and cases consider nine criteria in order to include both energy efficiencies and compactness.The assessment shows that acid gas removal using aMDEA/MDEA technology seems to perform well in terms of energy efficiency, volume and weight for low CO2 removal. However, for high CO2 content or strong polishing requirements, the chemical solvent technology loses its efficiency in terms of weight and volume. The assessment shows that the Selexol concept is an inefficient option in terms of energy efficiency, volume and weight, especially when large quantities of CO2 have to be removed from the gas stream. The assessment also shows that the low-temperature technology can be a compact and energy-efficient option, both in the case of strong polishing requirements and high bulk removal of CO2. However, the higher the amount of CO2 to be removed, the less energy efficient is the low-temperature technology.The case evaluation underlines the fact that the aMDEA/MDEA solvent concept exhibits the best or close to the best key performance indicators (KPIs) for all parameters for the RNG1Pipe case (raw natural gas specification 1 to pipeline quality specification) and therefore appears to be the best technology option. For this case, the two other technologies are slightly less energy efficient than the aMDEA/MDEA, but both are significantly less compact. For the RNG1 LNG (raw natural gas specification 1 to LNG quality specification) case, the aMDEA/MDEA and low-temperature concepts have similar KPIs. The chemical solvent technology, however, is slightly more energy efficient and compact and would therefore be preferred for the RNG1 LNG case. Finally, the RNG2 Pipe (raw natural gas specification 2 to pipeline quality specification) case shows that the low-temperature technology can be a compact option for acid gas removal, which is a critical factor in the case of offshore applications for both the equipment costs and the weight constraints on the platform. Despite its lower energy efficiency, it is therefore likely that the low-temperature technology will be selected in the RNG2 Pipe case. This choice is strengthened by some regulations which recommend that solvents such as MDEA and aMDEA should be phased out for offshore applications, as is seen, e.g. in Norway. In addition, if stricter regulations are also enforced for onshore applications, this might also argue in favour of the low-temperature technology or other chemical solvents that are otherwise less efficient than aMDEA/MDEA.Finally, the potential of hybrid concepts is discussed and suggested for future works, in order to combine the advantages of the different technologies, such as the energy-efficient performances of the aMDEA/MDEA concept and the compactness of the low-temperature concept.

TI  - Considerations for the use of carbon dioxide removal membranes in an offshore environment
AB  - Interest has been piqued in the use of membranes for the removal of bulk carbon dioxide from natural gas in an offshore environment because of the advantages that membranes present in weight, space efficiency and tolerance of motion. A number of practical considerations have to be considered when using membranes for CO2 removal offshore and these will be discussed in the context of recent KBR work. Membranes have strengths and weaknesses compared to other carbon dioxide removal technologies in an offshore environment. These strengths and weakness lead to specific concerns and opportunities that should be addressed in the design stage and can have impacts on the full life cycle of the offshore facility if not fully addressed. We will discuss how to approach these issues to lead to successful construction, operation and maintenance of the carbon dioxide removal membrane system in an offshore environment.

TI  - Transport systems for ocean disposal of CO2 and their environmental effects
AB  - After removal from the power plant flue gas, the CO2 has to be transported from the power plant to the deep ocean. Because of the vast quantities that need to be transported, this is a formidable engineering task. The transport systems will add significantly to the cost of CO2 disposal, and they may pose an environmental and safety risk. Considering that a single 1000 MW bituminous coal-fired power plant equipped with CO2 removal system will deliver between 7.2-8.2E6 T/y of CO2 (228-260 kg/s), the only practical transport systems appear to be pipes and large tankers in which the CO2 is transported as a liquid. The environmental impact of offshore pipes will occur mainly during the construction phase. In USA territorial waters pipes need to be buried to a depth of 61 m. This means blasting and digging through sediments and reefs. After construction, the underwater habitat will be restored in a few years. Tanker transport requires major port and docking facilities, which could lead to perturbations of coastal habitat, and contamination due to leakages, spills and effluents. As CO2 is stored and transported as a pressurized liquid, there is a risk of rupture and release of large quantities of CO2. At concentrations in air above 10%, CO2 is an asphyxiant, and at smaller concentrations it causes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and skin lesions. However the environmental impacts and safety hazards of CO2 transport systems can be minimized or altogether prevented with prudent management and exercise of precaution.

TI  - How does CO2-hydrate influence options for deep ocean carbon dioxide deposition?
AB  - To reduce the large amount of CO2 emitted to the atmosphere, several options for CO2 removal and deposition are considered. Three promising options are liquid CO2 disposed on the sea floor, liquid CO2 disposed in free water mass and shallow water dissolution. Since CO2-hydrate is thermodynamically stable at pressure higher than 4.45 MPa and temperatures less than 10.2 Â°C, it is expected to form naturally at depths larger than about 500 meters provided a source of high concentration CO2 is available. Hydrate formation is therefore expected to have significant influence on all deep ocean CO2 deposition options. In order to more quantitatively predict the influence of CO2 hydrates on various options for carbon dioxide deposition in the ocean, a comprehensive mathematical model for hydrate formation and stability has been developed. The model presented in this paper includes kinetics and thermodynamic phenomena relevant to the system high pressurized water and CO2. The microscale hydrate kinetics model is coupled with macroscale models for ocean disposal options, and simulation giving qualitative and quantitative indications of the effect of hydrate formation on these options is done. Simulations indicate that formation of a thin hydrate film on the interface of liquid CO2 and seawater on depths larger than 3500 meters will have a significant inhibiting effect on the spreading of CO2 in the ocean, and thus a positive effect on long time storage feasibility. For intermediate depth CQ2 deposition option, as a descending CO2 plume, hydrate formation will have a negative effect, by inhibiting dissolution of CO2 from the plume bubbles into the ambient ocean mass. However, it is suspected that hydrate kinetic factors, such as induction time and growth rate, is significantly reducing the effect of hydrate film on this option. The third option for ocean deposition, i.e. shallow water injection, will not be influenced by hydrate formation, since CO2 hydrate is not thermodynamically stable at the actual pressure and temperature.

TI  - THE ROLE OF CO2 REMOVAL AND DISPOSAL
AB  - This paper aims at examining the role of CO2 removal and disposal among various measures for CO2 abatement. The first part deals with the need of CO2 removal and disposal in the strategy toward stabilization of the air concentration of CO2. A macroscopic survey of CO2 emission in developed world indicates that reduction of CO2 emission will be a hard task as long as we employ only conventional measures and therefore implementation of innovative measures is indispensable for mankind to mitigate global warming substantially. The results of a model study on CO2 stabilization indicates that CO2 removal from flue gas and storage in some niches of the earth will play an important role within several tens years. The second part deals with the issue of CO2 ocean disposal, with referring to a controversy on its effectiveness in mitigating global warming and concludes that it is effective but needs more study both on science of CO2 behavior in the ocean and characteristics of damage function of global warming. Lastly the paper discusses the global strategy for CO2 abatement, taking into full account different stances of countries in the world and stresses the importance of concerted efforts of developed countries for RandD on CO2 removal and disposal technologies.

TI  - The Effects of Carbon Dioxide Removal on the Carbon Cycle
AB  - Increasing atmospheric CO2 is having detrimental effects on the Earth system. Societies have recognized that anthropogenic CO2 release must be rapidly reduced to avoid potentially catastrophic impacts. Achieving this via emissions reductions alone will be very difficult. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) has been suggested to complement and compensate for insufficient emissions reductions, through increasing natural carbon sinks, engineering new carbon sinks, or combining natural uptake with engineered storage. Here, we review the carbon cycle responses to different CDR approaches and highlight the often-overlooked interaction and feedbacks between carbon reservoirs that ultimately determines CDR efficacy. We also identify future research that will be needed if CDR is to play a role in climate change mitigation, these include coordinated studies to better understand (i) the underlying mechanisms of each method, (ii) how they could be explicitly simulated, (iii) how reversible changes in the climate and carbon cycle are, and (iv) how to evaluate and monitor CDR.

TI  - Feasibility and safety of low-flow extracorporeal CO2 removal managed with a renal replacement platform to enhance lung-protective ventilation of patients with mild-to-moderate ARDS
AB  - Background: Extracorporeal carbon-dioxide removal (ECCO2R) might allow ultraprotective mechanical ventilation with lower tidal volume (VT) (&lt;6 ml/kg predicted body weight), plateau pressure (Pplat) (&lt;30 cmH2O), and driving pressure to limit ventilator-induced lung injury. This study was undertaken to assess the feasibility and safety of ECCO2R managed with a renal replacement therapy (RRT) platform to enable very low tidal volume ventilation of patients with mild-to-moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Methods: Twenty patients with mild (n=8) or moderate (n=12) ARDS were included. VT was gradually lowered from 6 to 5, 4.5, and 4 ml/kg, and PEEP adjusted to reach 23â‰¤Pplatâ‰¤25 cmH2O. Standalone ECCO2R (no hemofilter associated with the RRT platform) was initiated when arterial PaCO2 increased by &gt;20% from its initial value. Ventilation parameters (VT, respiratory rate, PEEP), respiratory system compliance, Pplat and driving pressure, arterial blood gases, and ECCO2R-system operational characteristics were collected during at least 24 h of very low tidal volume ventilation. Complications, day-28 mortality, need for adjuvant therapies, and data on weaning off ECCO2R and mechanical ventilation were also recorded. Results: While VT was reduced from 6 to 4 ml/kg and Pplat kept &lt;25 cmH2O, PEEP was significantly increased from 13.4Â±3.6 cmH2O at baseline to 15.0Â±3.4 cmH2O, and the driving pressure was significantly reduced from 13.0Â±4.8 to 7.9Â±3.2 cmH2O (both p&lt;0.05). The PaO2/FiO2 ratio and respiratory-system compliance were not modified after VT reduction. Mild respiratory acidosis occurred, with mean PaCO2 increasing from 43Â±8 to 53Â±9 mmHg and mean pH decreasing from 7.39Â±0.1 to 7.32Â±0.10 from baseline to 4 ml/kg VT, while the respiratory rate was not altered. Mean extracorporeal blood flow, sweep-gas flow, and CO2 removal were 421Â±40 ml/min, 10Â±0.3 L/min, and 51Â±26 ml/min, respectively. Mean treatment duration was 31Â±22 h. Day-28 mortality was 15%. Conclusions: A low-flow ECCO2R device managed with an RRT platform easily and safely enabled very low tidal volume ventilation with moderate increase in PaCO2 in patients with mild-to-moderate ARDS.

TI  - Effect of the addition of calcium carbonate on the barrier behavior of polyamide 11 used in offshore applications by electrochemical impedance analysis
AB  - In offshore oilfield exploration, flexible pipe technology has gained importance as a convenient and effective way to connect seafloor wellheads to sea level oil platforms. This structure has several layers each one presenting specific functions: polymeric layers â€“ fluid barrier and metal layers â€“ mechanical strength. Polyamide-11 (PA11) was one of the first polymers used for the internal insulation layers in flexible pipes used in offshore oilfield exploitation. The aim of this work is to evaluate the effect of calcium carbonate particle size (nanoparticles â€“ NPCC and microparticles â€“ PCC) on the barrier properties of PA11 matrix, the grade used in the pressure layer of flexible pipes, towards the diffusion of ions and molecules present in crude oil. This evaluation was based on acquisition of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy data, which helps to interpret the metallic corrosion behavior. The results indicated that the PA11/NPCC system formed a better protective corrosion barrier over carbon steel due to its higher polarization resistance when compared to neat PA11 and PA11/PCC composite.

TI  - 2D Materials for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction
AB  - The traditional energy consumption mode has caused many environmental problems and the rise of the energy crisis as well. On the one hand, the reserves of unrenewable fossil energies, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, are quite limited. On the other hand, the excessive consumption of fossil energies has emitted too many environmental unfriendly products, such as the greenhouse gas CO2. In the past decade, the average CO2 emissions in the world was as high as about 32.53 billion tons per year. In 2019, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere reached 412 ppm. The large concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has caused many serious environmental problems, such as global warming, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, glacier melting, and climate change. To solve these problems, one way is to replace the fossil energies with renewable clean energies like wind and solar electricity, which can decrease the CO2 emissions. However, wind and solar electricity suffer from an intermittent supply, unstable frequency, and hard delivery. Another way is to directly convert CO2 to other high-value chemicals and fuels with proper physicochemical methods, like thermochemical conversion, electrochemical reduction, and photocatalytic reduction. Very recently, with the combination of the aforementioned two ways, electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) powered by clean wind and solar electricity has become the most promising solution to address the CO2-caused environmental problems. Firstly, eCO2RR can be well coupled to the local clean energy power plants to fully utilize the clean electricity by converting CO2 to value-added chemicals and fuels. Secondly, eCO2RR is an efficient technique to achieve a carbon neutral cycle. Thirdly, the eCO2RR system runs under mild conditions with relative high energy efficiency. Â© 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Towards commercialization: Challenges in scaling up lab scale membrane for field performance evaluation
AB  - Membrane technology is favorable for bulk CO2 removal from natural gas due to several advantages such as simple operation, no chemical or moving parts, smaller footprint and weight over other technologies, and high reliability. It has led to massive fundamental research efforts in producing better membrane performance throughout the world. However, scaling up the lab scale membrane for field performance evaluation can be quite challenging. The challenges include consistency in membrane quality for large volume process, membrane module design and fabrication techniques, harsh operating conditions with field contaminants fluctuation, and process facilities requirement for offshore application. All the scale up challenges will need to be properly addressed diligently in order to ensure the membrane can be successfully applied as per the intended field specification.

TI  - Chemo-Mechanical Energy Harvesters with Enhanced Intrinsic Electrochemical Capacitance in Carbon Nanotube Yarns
AB  - Predicting and preventing disasters in difficult-to-access environments, such as oceans, requires self-powered monitoring devices. Since the need to periodically charge and replace batteries is an economic and environmental concern, energy harvesting from external stimuli to supply electricity to batteries is increasingly being considered. Especially, in aqueous environments including electrolytes, coiled carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn harvesters have been reported as an emerging approach for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy driven by large and reversible capacitance changes under stretching and releasing. To realize enhanced harvesting performance, experimental and computational approaches to optimize structural homogeneity and electrochemical accessible area in CNT yarns to maximize intrinsic electrochemical capacitance (IEC) and stretch-induced changes are presented here. Enhanced IEC further enables to decrease matching impedance for more energy efficient circuits with harvesters. In an ocean-like environment with a frequency from 0.1 to 1 Hz, the proposed harvester demonstrates the highest volumetric power (1.6-10.45 mW cm(-3)) of all mechanical harvesters reported in the literature to the knowledge of the authors. Additionally, a high electrical peak power of 540 W kg(-1) and energy conversion efficiency of 2.15\% are obtained from torsional and tensile mechanical energy.

TI  - Use of membranes for gas processing at offshore- A case study
AB  - The case study applies to an Indian offshore production field which consists of 4 unmanned well head platforms (A1, A2, A3 and AB) and a chartered hired FPSO connected via PLEM to the hub platform AB. The producing wells use gas lift supplied from gas compressors located on the FPSO. Liquid produced is evacuated by tankers and excess gas is exported to an adjacent field via a 16" Ã— 46 km pipeline. New discoveries with total oil in-place volume of 75.55 MMt and associated gas with greater than 30% CO2 have posed a challenge to bring into production. The gas compressors on the FPSO were designed to for gas with maximum 12% of CO2 and as the FPSO is a leased asset, the increased CO2 in the feed was considered "a strict no-no". Also, excess gas is exported via and must have less than 6% CO2 to meet the export pipeline specification. A concept study was done to identify a feasible method to produce the higher CO2 gas without major changes in FPSO handling facilities. In the technology selection: Solvent adsorption, Absorption beds and Membrane system were evaluated for their usage at an unmanned platform. The selection criteria included: Required foot-print & weight, moving parts and minimum intervention. The study recommended a membrane system be used. This project has many firsts for Offshore India such as: Membrane based CO2 removal, a low BTU hot flare for reject stream disposal and Micro-turbines for meeting basic power requirement. All this will be discussed with fabrication pictures and implementation details. Scheduled offshore platform commissioning is in January 2021. Â© 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Purification of magnesium chloride from mixed brines via hydrogen chloride absorption with ambient temperature and pressure regeneration of super azeotropic hydrochloric acid
AB  - Desalination is an important source of potable water for a large portion of the world that is expected to expand in response to population increase and climate change. Despite its benefits, desalination produces a hypersaline waste, termed â€˜brineâ€™, which has negative impacts on the marine ecosystem and is costly to dispose of safely. An integral step in making desalination more environmentally friendly is the elimination of liquid wastes, so-called â€˜Zero Liquid Dischargeâ€™. To make Zero Liquid Discharge financially viable, it is critical to separate and purify the constituent salts into products. We report on the design and operation of a system for continuous production of high purity Mg-chloride from desalination brine. This system is part of a Zero Liquid Discharge process that makes desalination net negative in terms of CO2 emissions by converting magnesium chloride into magnesium carbonate. Precipitation of sodium and potassium chloride from brine was achieved by absorption of a super azeotropic HCl gas. The super azeotropic HCl gas was regenerated by mixing the acidified brine in a low-temperature, saturated magnesium chloride solution. The system recovered 89% of the Mg2+ content of desalination brine as 99.6 mol% purity magnesium chloride. This level of recovery and purity without the use of consumable chemicals is not found elsewhere in industry or the literature. Internal regeneration of HCl reached 66% at a HCl concentration of 54 wt%. Empirical results suggest a longer operation would yield 92% regeneration of 65 wt% HCl. Using lessons learned from this test program, a range of long-term continuous operation conditions were found that could regenerate &gt;95% of HCl at a concentration of &gt;90 wt%. Such performance may make this novel HCl regeneration process interesting to industries that require hydrochloric acid recycling, such as hydrometallurgy. With the recovery and purity of magnesium chloride achieved in the current system, desalination brine can be converted into product streams, including those applicable for atmospheric CO2 removal.

TI  - Acid gas removing technology in an offshore skid mount LNG plant
AB  - Associated gas in offshore oil fields is one of most valuable energy resources, but due to its tiny production, it is not cost effective for pipeline transportation. Thus, a skid mounted LNG plant, which is set up on the offshore mobile platform, is independently developed. A criterion of determining the acid gas removing technology was put forward, and the mixed MDEA+MEA solutions were used in the CO2 removal process for this self developed plant. An optimal analysis was made on the major parameters in this process. The CO2 content in the feed gas should be regularly analyzed and the circulating amount of MDEA solution should be moderately adjusted to effectively reduce the operating cost of the plant and improve the adaptability of this plant for dealing with different composition associated gas in offshore oil fields. The LNG plant, which could handle the liquefied LNG process, and store and unload the LNG simultaneously, simplifies the development of the associated gas in offshore oil fields with many advantages, e.g., good adaptability, low investment, short construction circle, and quick return on capital.

TI  - An experimental study of CO2 hydrate-based seawater desalination with the R141b as an accelerant
AB  - In the previous development of those continental and offshore sour gas fields in China, CO2 removed from the produced natural gas contributed a lot to carbon emission, which not only led to global warming but brought about a great loss. However, the recycling of CO2 produced along with natural gas has aroused research interest in present China. CO2 hydrate-based desalination is a new seawater desalination technique that is still in laboratory research in China. This technique uses small-molecule materials, which easily form hydrate, and seawater to form solid hydrate and after the solid-liquid separation, fresh water can be obtained from the solid hydrate dissociation. In order to improve the efficiency of CO2 hydrate-based desalination, in this experimental study, R141b was used as an accelerant to accelerate the forming speed of CO2 hydrate in seawater. Based on our experimental device with two reactors developed for hydrate seawater desalination, the R141b proportion and its effects on the efficiency of CO2 hydrate-based desalination were discussed, and the technical parameters of this method were also suggested. The degree of seawater desalination was discussed through measuring the variation of the salinities and ionic concentrations in the solution before and after the hydrate was formed. The following findings were achieved. a. The optimal v/v ratio of R141b to seawater was 1:70. The efficiency of CO2 hydrate-based desalination with R141b was 3 times higher than that without R141b. b. The removing rates of ions in the first and second grade desalination water were 58.7% and 81.0%, respectively, and reached up to 94.8% and 98.4% in the third and fourth grade desalination water, respectively. c. The ionic concentrations in the fourth grade desalination water were even better than those in the national standard drinking water.

TI  - FUEL-CELL AND ELECTROLYSIS BY-PRODUCT D20 IMPROVES THIRD WAY TO MITIGATE CO2
AB  - Rapid atomic power deployment may be possible without using fast breeder reactors or making undue demands on uranium resource. Using by-product D20 and thorium-U233 in CANDU and RBMK piles may circumvent need for either fast breeder reactors or seawater uranium. Atmospheric CO2 is presently increasing 2.25\%/a (2.25 percent per year) in proportion to 2.25\%/a exponential fossil fuel consumption increase. Roughly 1/3 anthropologic CO2 is removed by various CO2 sinks. CO2 removal is modeled as being proportional to 50-year-earlier CO2 amount above 280 ppm-C. Water electrolysis produces roughly 0.1 kg-D20/kWa. Material balance assumes each electrolysis stage increases D20 bottoms concentration times 3. Except for first electrolysis stage, all water from hydrogen consumption is returned to electrolysis. D20 enrichment from water electrolysis is augmented by using the resulting Hydrogen and Oxygen in fuel cells. Condensate from hydrogen consumption returns to the appropriate electrolysis stage. Fuel cell condensate originally from reformed natural gas may augment second-stage feed. Previously, recycling only hydrogen from combustion back to upper electrolysis stages allowed a 5\%/a atomic power expansion. Using fuel-cells to augment upper-stage electrolysis enrichment increases atomic power expansion from 5\%/a to 6\%/a. Implementation of this process should start by 2020 to minimize peak atmospheric CO2 concentration to 850 ppm-C. Atomic power expansion is 6\%/a, giving 45000 GW by 2100. World primary energy increases at the historic rate of 2.25\%/a, exceeding 4000 EJ-thermal/a by 2100. J-electric similar to 3J-thermal. CO2 maximum is roughly 850 ppm-C around year 2100. CO2 declines back below 350 ppm-C by 2250 if the 50-year-delay seawater sink remains effective. The 15-year global temperature rise hiatus is apparently caused by convective heat transfer into seawater. Presumably convective CO2 transfer into seawater also occurs by the same mechanism. Each decade rapid atomic power expansion is delayed results in a 100 ppm increase in maximum atmospheric CO2 concentration. 50 TW dispatchable CSP (concentrated solar power), including 2 TWa storage, costs 1600 trillion USD and covers two Australias.

TI  - Corrosion resistance behavior of PVDF/ZrO2 composite in 3.5% NaCl
AB  - Marine structures come into contact with the seawater. Corrosion occurs on the walls of these structures and can quickly lead from surface damage to aesthetics impairment. The main cause of the corrosiveness are chloride ions which facilitate initiation and propagation of pits. Stainless steels provide a wide range of applications in seawater environments. They are used for the construction of heat exchangers, tanks and capacitors for electrical systems, refrigeration systems for power plants, tidal power, wind turbines localized at sea. Mild steel find its role in almost every product created from metal due to its low cost and easy availability. The polymeric materials are having multiple adsorption sites for bonding with metal surface and provides higher inhibition efficiency than the corresponding monomers. In the present work, the corrosion inhibition of mild steel in 3.5% NaCl by PVDF/ ZrO2 composites were studied. The composite samples were characterized by using XRD, FTIR and SEM. Potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic techniques were used to explore the enhanced corrosion inhibition of composites. The corrosion inhibition efficiency of PVDZr composites were found to increase with increase in concentration of ZrO2. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Revisiting strontium-doped lanthanum cuprate perovskite for the electrochemical reduction of CO2
AB  - The conversion of wind, solar or marine energies to fuels and chemicals can exploit the chemical utilisation of carbon dioxide, and could lead to a more sustainable chemical industry. In particular, electrolytic conversion of CO 2 may suit the short-term variability of the energy supply while avoiding issues associated with the large scale storage of hydrogen. Lanthanum cuprate perovskites were described a while ago as promising electrocatalysts for the production of valuable higher alcohols, ethylene and methane from CO 2. However, confusion was apparent in the literature as to the nature of the compound that was used, and the data on applied potentials was scarce. In this paper, we report on the electroreduction of CO2 at a gas diffusion electrode loaded with a strontium-doped lanthanum cuprate perovskite in 0.5 M KOH. The compound was prepared following the procedure that was described in previous literature on CO2 electroreduction, and it was characterised as a mixture of bi-layered La1.8Sr 0.2CuO4 with tetragonal (La,Sr)CuO2.6. We also extended the range of temperatures (2-40 C) and pressures (1-43 barg). Methane and ethylene were major products of electroreduction, unlike in previous work where alcohols were dominant. Results and the operational experience from this work should help direct effort towards catalysts that have the advantages of copper metal without its limitations. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Novel Biosurfactants for Effective Inhibition of Gas Hydrate Agglomeration and Corrosion in Offshore Oil and Gas Pipelines
AB  - Gas hydrate and corrosion inhibitors are widely used to ensure a successful and economic hydrocarbon stream flow inside oil and gas pipelines. However, compatibility problems are observed during their co-injection into the flowlines as they have different molecular chemistry. Using anti-agglomerant hydrate inhibitors is an effective method to control the gas hydrate plugging risk in deep-water hydrocarbon flow lines or throughout drilling operations. Here, oleic acid was used to develop the first class of biosurfactants as anti-agglomerant and corrosion inhibitors using click chemistry for flow assurance applications. The results of high-pressure autoclave showed that both bio-based anti-agglomerants (BAAs) significantly inhibited gas hydrate agglomeration, and the value of torque remained constant during the hydrate formation process. The hydrate particles were effectively dispersed in liquid paraffin in the presence of 1 wt \% of BAA1 or BAA2. In addition, molecular dynamic simulation revealed that the headgroup of BAA1 was adsorbed on the hydrate surface, and its alkyl chain dispersed the hydrate formed in the hydrocarbon phase as a slurry. According to electrochemical measurements, both BAAs were highly efficient inhibitors for the prevention of mild steel corrosion in saturated H2S and CO2-simulated oilfield water. BAA1 and BAA2 completely protected the steel in the corrosive medium by 99 and 98.8\%, respectively, at 0.1 wt \%. Moreover, the adsorption of BAA1 molecules on the steel surface was both physically and chemically in a direction that was almost parallel to the surface. Such adsorption provides the maximum surface coverage against corrosion. These findings suggest that oleic acid can be used as a potential starting material to develop eco-friendly inhibitors for flow assurance in oil and gas pipelines.

TI  - Membrane separation of CO2 from natural gas
AB  - Raw natural gas, one of the most important fuel sources worldwide, contains high level of CO2, which must be removed to avoid problems like pipeline corrosion, compression cost and reduction of heating value. The three main technologies used to separate CO2 from natural gas include cryogenic distillation, amine absorption and membranes. Membrane technologies have various advantages especially for offshore platforms. In recent years, more and more membrane systems have been applied to large offshore natural gas upgrading projects. Two entirely different membrane processes can be applied to the separation of CO2 from natural gas: gas permeation membranes and membrane contactors. Objective: An overview of some recent patents and related scientific literature on both gas permeation membranes and membrane contactors for CO2 removal from natural gas is important to focus on the key points for further advances. Methods: From a thorough literature review of membrane processes for CO2 separation from natural gas, several patents on this application have been identified and here reviewed. Besides, recent papers in the field are discussed. Conclusion: Membrane systems require a relatively small operational area, small amounts of energy, only minor operational efforts with moderate maintenance and inspection requirements. Hence the interest from oil gas industry companies such as UOP, Lâ€™Air Liquide, Statoil Petroleum, Aker Process Systems, which are applicants and assignees of most patents for CO2 removal from natural gas by membrane technologies.

TI  - Comparison of Pretreatment Methods for Salinity Gradient Power Generation Using Reverse Electrodialysis (RED) Systems
AB  - With the increasing concern about climate change and the energy crisis, the use of reverse electrodialysis (RED) to utilize salinity gradient power (SGP) has drawn attention as one of the promising renewable energy sources. However, one of the critical issues in RED processes is membrane fouling and channel blockage, which lead to a decrease in the power density. Thus, this study aims to improve our understanding of SGP generation by using RED by investigating the effect of pretreatment on the RED performance. Experiments were conducted by using a laboratory-scale experimental setup for RED. The low-salinity and high-salinity feed solutions were brackish water reverse osmosis (BWRO) brine from a wastewater reclamation plant, and a NaCl solution simulating seawater desalination brine. Several pretreatments were applied to the RED process, such as cartridge filter (CF), microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), activated filter media (AFM), and granular activated carbon (GAC). The results indicate that the open-circuit voltage (OCV) and the power density were similar, except for in the NF pretreatment, which removed the dissolved ions to increase the net SGP. However, the pressure in the RED stack was significantly affected by the pretreatment types. The excitationâ€“emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy and the parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) quantified the organic compounds that are related to the stack pressure. These results suggest that the removal of both colloidal and organic matters by pretreatments is crucial for improving the RED performance by reducing the pressure that is increased in the RED stack.

TI  - A review of climate geoengineering proposals
AB  - Climate geoengineering proposals seek to rectify the current radiative imbalance via either (1) reducing incoming solar radiation (solar radiation management) or (2) removing CO2 from the atmosphere and transferring it to long-lived reservoirs (carbon dioxide removal). For each option, we discuss its effectiveness and potential side effects, also considering lifetime of effect, development and deployment timescale, reversibility, and failure risks. We present a detailed review that builds on earlier work by including the most recent literature, and is more extensive than previous comparative frameworks. Solar radiation management propsals are most effective but short-lived, whilst carbon dioxide removal measures gain effectiveness the longer they are pursued. Solar radiation management could restore the global radiative balance, but must be maintained to avoid abrupt warming, meanwhile ocean acidification and residual regional climate changes would still occur. Carbon dioxide removal involves less risk, and offers a way to return to a pre-industrial CO2 level and climate on a millennial timescale, but is potentially limited by the CO2 storage capacity of geological reservoirs. Geoengineering could complement mitigation, but it is not an alternative to it.

TI  - New Application of Brown Sea Algae as an Alternative to Phosphorous-Containing Antiscalant
AB  - Over the past decade, green chemistry research has focused on the importance of protecting the environment, especially to align with UN sustainable development goals by avoiding the use of chemicals that are harmful to the environment and society. In this study, an aqueous extract derived from brown sea algae, was prepared and its performance as antiscalant was compared to commercial antiscalant (Hydroxy ethylidene, 1-Diphosphonic Acid, HEDP) and evaluated using electrochemical measurements, conductivity and standard NACE test in addition to microscopic examination. It was found that there is a significant inhibition efficiency of brown algae towards the tested scales as HEDP. The obtained extract had the ability to prevent precipitation of calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate, barium sulfate and strontium carbonate with percent inhibition of 100%, 80%, 84% and 75%, respectively. The inhibitory effect of the extract can be attributed to the presence of carboxylate and hydroxyl groups that are adsorbed on the surface sites and disturb the normal crystal growth of the scale. The results of the study will lead to the discovery of further new applications of ecologically, cost-effective, renewable source and benign antiscalant that can be considered as an alternative to non-green technologies particularly those used in the food and pharmaceutical industries as well as in desalination plants.

TI  - Hydrodynamic characteristics and mass transfer performance of rotating packed bed for CO2 removal by chemical absorption: A review
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) removal is an important process in natural gas processing. For offshore natural gas, due to the space limitations of offshore platforms, the volume requirement of CO2 removal equipment is very strict. Therefore, high-efficient CO2 removal equipment is needed to meet the processing requirements of natural gas. As a new type of process intensification technology, the rotating packed bed (RPB) is a desirable candidate for removing CO2 from offshore natural gas due to its good mass transfer performance and considerable size savings. In this paper, the research progress of RPBs is reviewed from the aspects of hydrodynamic characteristics and mass transfer performance. Different research methods have been discussed, and their advantages and disadvantages have been pointed out. The factors that affect the efficiency of CO2 removal have been analyzed, and operational recommendations have been given. Suggestions for future research are put forward to promote the application of RPBs on offshore platforms for CO2 removal from offshore natural gas. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A Study on CO2 removal process technology with solvent method on offshore platform
AB  - Limited to the factors like platform space and cost, generally the offshore natural wet gas contained high content of CO2 is just dehydrated and then compressed to onshore gas plant for further CO2 removal. So far there is no offshore application for CO2 removal with solvent absorption method in sea areas of China and around the world. So it is badly needed to study the offshore CO2 removal process technology which is beneficial for offshore gas field development. Based on certain new found gas field with CO2 content of 32% (mole fraction) in South China Sea, three kinds of CO2 removal technology with solvent absorption method including Low Temp PC method, Ambient Temp PC method and Ambient Temp DEPG method are studied with detailed comparison and analysis. The main concerns focus on process flow diagram, minimizing energy consumption, maximizing hydrocarbon recoveries and reducing total weight and cost and so on. Finally the best CO2 removal technology, Low Temp PC Method, is recommended, which provides guidance and reference for the similar gas fields, especially it meets the requirement of reducing the cost and improving the quality under low oil price situation nowadays.

TI  - Fractal behavior of surface oxide crack patterns on AISI 4140 high-strength low-alloy steel exposed to the simulated offshore environment
AB  - Wear and corrosion are surface-dependent degradation phenomena pertinent to the hostile environment existing in deep-sea oil and gas wells containing aggressive chemical species such as chloride/bromide salts, organic acids, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide,etc. Apart from the identification of the potential failures of alloys that can occur on a large and devastating scale by its interaction with these deleterious species, it is also essential to comprehend the nature and character, particularly the cracking pattern of the surface oxides formed on alloys undergoing corrosion in a particular environment. This article uses fractal geometry to study the branching of the surface oxide crack patterns in AISI 4140 high-strength low-alloy steel after exposure in a simulated offshore corrosive environment containing aqueous 3.5 wt.\% sodium chloride solution. The fractal geometry was evaluated using the box-count technique in three different electrolytic test conditions: Electrochemical Anodic Polarization, Electrochemical Cathodic Polarization, and Immersion Corrosion for 24 h. Our results showed that the magnitude of fractal dimension is highest during immersion corrosion for 24 h and lowest during anodic polarization. Fractals can provide complementary quantifiable information about the surface geometries and fracture crack patterns from macrostructural to microstructural length scales by image analysis. This approach can be leveraged by emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision (CV), in structural health monitoring of alloys used in exotic and challenging conditions.

TI  - Enhancement of nitrogen removal and energy recovery from low C/N ratio sewage by multi-electrode electrochemical technology and tidal flow via siphon aeration
AB  - In view of the difficulty in denitrification of low C/N ratio wastewater, electrochemical technology with multiple electrodes and tidal flow method via siphon aeration were used to enhance the denitrification process. At the same time, because of the low phosphorus removal efficiency in traditional activated sludge process, the constructed wetland and microbial fuel cell (CW-MFC) reactor with dewatered alum sludge (DAS) as substrate were constructed. In addition, the REDOX conditions of the reactor were changed by siphon, which significantly improved the removal efficiency of N and P and the energy recovery capacity of the reactor. In the 172 d, the Tidal Flow Constructed Wetland-Microbial Fuel Cell (TF CW-MFC) had the highest removal efficiency of COD and total nitrogen (TN), which were 97.4% and 83.4%, respectively. Although the removal rate of total phosphorus (TP) by TF CW-MFC was lower than artificial aeration, it can still reached 89.0%. The removal effect of aromatic protein substances in water was also significant. The amount of electrons generated by the artificial aeration anode and the amount of oxygen generated by the cathode were not enough to match. The voltage of TF CW-MFC was significantly higher than artificial aeration, around 350 mV, and the maximum power density was 98.16 mW mâˆ’3. In addition, MFC had an inhibitory effect on CW methane emissions. The analysis of the microbial community structure showed that most of the dominant bacteria of TF CW-MFC belonged to the Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi. These results showed that the TF CW-MFC technology as a zero-energy oxygen supply mode had high efficiency in the treatment of low C/N ratio wastewater and also had the environmental effect of reducing methane emissions. This study suggests that this green wastewater treatment technology has potential application value. Â© 2022

TI  - Pilot scale applied research on CO2 removal of natural gas using a rotating packed bed with propylene carbonate
AB  - Absorption of CO2 from a CO2/N-2 mixture with propylene carbonate (PC) as the absorbent using a rotating packed bed (RPB) in pilot scale was systematically investigated in this paper. RPB is characterized by simple operation and high efficiency with small volume, which may be an alternative method for CO2 removal offshore. The effects of operating parameters on the removal efficiency of CO2 and the K(y)a values such as temperature, pressure, inlet liquid flow rate and the rotational speed of RPB were studied. Experimental results indicated that the efficiency of this absorption process could be regulated by appropriate operating conditions of the RPB. (C) 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

TI  - Global CO2 recycling - Novel materials and prospect for prevention of global warming and abundant energy supply
AB  - CO2 emissions which induce global warming, increase with the growth of the economic activity. It is, therefore, impossible to decrease emissions only by energy savings and by improvements of the energy efficiency. Global CO2 recycling can solve this problem and supply abundant renewable energy. Global CO2 recycling consists of three districts: (i) in deserts, all necessary electricities are generated by solar cells; (ii) on coasts close to the deserts, the electricity is used for production of H2 by seawater electrolysis, H2 is converted to CH4 by the reaction with CO2 and liquefied CH4 is transported to energy consuming districts; (iii) at energy consuming district, after CH4 is used as a fuel, CO2 is recovered, liquefied and transported to the coasts close to the deserts. A CO2 recycling plant for substantiation of our idea has been built on the roof of our Institute (IMR) in 1996, using key materials tailored by us. The key materials necessary for global CO2 recycling are the anode and cathode for seawater electrolysis and the catalyst for CO2 methanation. Since the quantities of CO2 to be converted far exceed an industrial level, the system must be very simple and the rate of conversion must be very fast. These requirements are satisfied in our global CO2 recycling system. When global CO2 recycling is conducted on a large scale, the energies and costs required to form liquefied CH4 in our global CO2 recycling system are almost the same as those for production of LNG from natural gas wells. A project for field experimenting the global CO2 recycling using pilot plants in Egypt has been planned in cooperation with Egyptian scientists, engineers and industries.

TI  - Emit now, mitigate later? Earth system reversibility <?xmltex \textbackslash{}hack\{\textbackslash{}break\}?> under overshoots of different magnitudes and durations
AB  - Anthropogenic CO2 emissions cause irreversible climate change on centennial to millennial timescales, yet current mitigation efforts are insufficient to limit global warming to a level that is considered safe. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) has been suggested as an option to partially reverse climate change and to return the Earth system to a less dangerous state after a period of temperature overshoot. Whether or to what extent such partial reversal of climate change under CDR would happen is, next to socio-economic feasibility and sustainability, key to assessing CDR as a mitigation option. Here, we use a state-of-the-art Earth system model that includes a representation of permafrost carbon to investigate the reversibility of the Earth system after overshoots of different durations and magnitudes in idealized simulations. We find that atmospheric CO2 concentrations are slightly lower after an overshoot, compared to a reference simulation without overshoot, due to a near-perfect compensation of carbon losses from land by increased ocean carbon uptake during the overshoot periods. The legacy of an overshoot is, on a centennial timescale, indiscernible (within natural variability) from a reference case without overshoot for many aspects of the Earth system including global average surface temperature, marine and terrestrial productivity, strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, surface ocean pH, surface O2 concentration, and permafrost extent, except in the most extreme overshoot scenario considered in this study. Consistent with previous studies, we find irreversibility in permafrost carbon and deep ocean properties like seawater temperature, pH, and O2 concentrations. We do not find any indication of tipping points or self-reinforcing feedbacks that would put the Earth system on a significantly different trajectory after an overshoot. Hence, the effectiveness of CDR in partially reversing large-scale patterns of climate change might not be the main issue of CDR but rather the impacts and risks that would occur during the period of elevated temperatures during the overshoot.

TI  - Qualification program for subsea batteries
AB  - Objective/Scope: Cost reduction, deep water, long-step outs, HSE (Health, Safety and Environment) and reduction of carbon footprint drive the change from hydraulic to all-electric subsea control systems in the offshore oil and gas production. The main challenge of an all-electric control system is the safe and reliable actuation of the valves on the tree. A battery provides the power and energy to supply the electric actuators to close the valves in case of an ESD (Emergency Shutdown). The paper presents the qualification program developed to access the performance and safety over the design life of 25 years together with the results after a 3-year qualification program. Methods, Procedures, Process: The qualification program was based on a risk assessment taking into consideration the uncertainties associated to this novel subsea technology and the API 17F for qualification requirements. The qualification program developed covers the following main sections: Misuse (destructive testing), Cycle Testing, Environmental Testing and EMI (Electro-magnetic Interference) testing. To access the state of health a large signal EIS (Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) has been developed and applied throughout the qualification program together with the DC-resistance and capacity measurements. For the cycle testing a DoE (Design of Experiment) methodology has been applied to develop a test plan which includes the parameters: Temperature, cycles and idle time. The testing was performed on 30 cells in parallel. Results, Observations, and Conclusions: The qualification results show a degradation of the battery depending on the parameter sets. The EIS measurements correlate with the degradation of the battery performance. The testing parameters range from-4Â°C to 50Â°C to stimulate an increased degradation. A reference group was used to access the acceleration factor for the increased temperature. The DC (Direct Current) measurements show an increase of the internal resistance over time. Novel/Additive Information: The results provide details for a qualification program for subsea batteries in order to access the performance over the lifetime of 25 years. The program includes additional testing and monitoring compared to the API 17F requirements for PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards). The qualification program also provides information about the degradation kinematics of Li-Ion Batteries over the design life of 25 years. Based on the results of the qualification program a design life of 25 years can be concluded. Â© 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Negative-CO2-emissions ocean thermal energy conversion
AB  - Conversion of the ocean's vertical thermal energy gradient to electricity via Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) has been demonstrated at small scales over the past century, and represents one of the largest (and growing) potential energy sources on the planet. Here we describe how OTEC could be modified to provide a large source of CO2-emissions-negative energy while also allowing heat removal from the surface ocean, helping to directly counter ocean/atmosphere warming. Most OTEC energy potential is far offshore, thus the conversion of the produced electricity to a chemical energy carrier such as H2 or derivatives is required. This can be achieved by employing a method of electrochemically generating H2 that also consumes CO2, converting the carbon to a common form of ocean alkalinity. The addition of such alkalinity to the ocean would provide high-capacity carbon storage while countering the chemical and biological effects of ocean acidification. For each gigawatt (GW) of continuous electric power generated over one year by the preceding negative-emissions OTEC (NEOTEC), roughly 13 GW of surface ocean heat would be directly removed to deep water, while producing 1.3 Ã— 105 tonnes of H2/yr (avoiding 1.1 Ã— 106 tonnes of CO2 emissions/yr), and consuming and storing (as dissolved mineral bicarbonate) approximately 5 Ã— 106 tonnes CO2/yr. The preceding CO2 mitigation would result in an indirect planetary cooling effect of about 2.6 GW. Such negative-emissions energy production and global warming mitigation would avoid the biophysical and land use limitations posed by methods that rely on terrestrial biology. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Geoengineering the climate: An overview and update
AB  - The climate change that we are experiencing now is caused by an increase in greenhouse gases due to human activities, including burning fossil fuels, agriculture and deforestation. There is now widespread belief that a global warming of greater than 2?C above preindustrial levels would be dangerous and should therefore be avoided. However, despite growing concerns over climate change and numerous international attempts to agree on reductions of global CO2 emissions, these have continued to climb. This has led some commentators to suggest more radical 'geoengineering' alternatives to conventional mitigation by reductions in CO2 emissions. Geoengineering is deliberate intervention in the climate system to counteract man-made global warming. There are two main classes of geoengineering: direct carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation management that aims to cool the planet by reflecting more sunlight back to space. The findings of the review of geoengineering carried out by the UK Royal Society in 2009 are summarized here, including the climate effects, costs, risks and research and governance needs for various approaches. The possible role of geoengineering in a portfolio of responses to climate change is discussed, and various recent initiatives to establish good governance of research activity are reviewed. Key findings include the following.-Geoengineering is not a magic bullet and not an alternative to emissions reductions.-Cutting global greenhouse gas emissions must remain our highest priority. (i) But this is proving to be difficult, and geoengineering may be useful to support it.-Geoengineering is very likely to be technically possible. (i) However, there are major uncertainties and potential risks concerning effectiveness, costs and social and environmental impacts.-Much more research is needed, as well as public engagement and a system of regulation (for both deployment and for possible large-scale field tests).-The acceptability of geoengineering will be determined as much by social, legal and political issues as by scientific and technical factors. Some methods of both types would involve release of materials to the environment, either to the atmosphere or to the oceans, in areas beyond national jurisdiction. The intended impacts on climate would in any case affect many or all countries, possibly to a variable extent. There are therefore inherent international implications for deployment of such geoengineering methods (and possibly also for some forms of research), which need early and collaborative consideration, before any deployment or large-scale experiments could be undertaken responsibly.

TI  - RESULTS AND FULL FUEL-CYCLE STUDY PLANS FROM THE IEA GREENHOUSE-GAS RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
AB  - Fourteen countries have signed an agreement to take part in an initial three-year programme of research and development aimed at potential mitigation techniques in response to the issue of global warming. Formed under the aegis of the International Energy Agency (IEA), the programme brings together those countries interested in establishing the techniques, costs, and environmental consequences of removing CO2 and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuel-based power station flue gases and storing or otherwise disposing of them. The programme has evaluated many fossil fuel power generation options, with the technologies required for CO2 removal. Using the technical and economic results from these studies the programme has recently commenced a detailed specification for a series of full scale `full fuel cycle' studies. The programme will culminate in proposals aimed at demonstration facilities should any of the full fuel cycle technologies show sufficient promise. In addition, the programme could be expanded to look in more detail at CO2 disposal options and the question of methane and its contribution to global warming. The project structure and work programme to date are described in outline and a summary of the results to date is given, with an overview of all of the technologies involved.

TI  - Carbon materials for extraction of uranium from seawater
AB  - With the rapid growth of population and industrialization, the energy crisis and environmental pollution as two main difficulties urgently need to be solved nowadays. The development and utilization of nuclear energy is of great significance for solving energy support, national security and environmental protection. As the raw material of nuclear energy, a lot of uranium in seawater provide a guarantee for the sustainable and green development of nuclear power plants. Recently, various new carbon-based materials (e.g., carbon nanofibers, multiwalled carbon nanotube, graphene) have been attracted widely intense interest in extraction of uranium from seawater due to large specific surface area, excellent acid-base resistance, high adsorption performance, environmental friendly and low cost. Thus, the systematic reviews concerning the extraction of uranium from seawater on various carbon-based materials were highly desirable. In this review, the extraction methods of uranium from seawater, including electrochemical, photocatalytic and adsorption methods are briefly introduced. Then the application and mechanism of four generation carbon-based materials on the extraction of uranium from seawater are systematically reviewed in details. Finally, the current challenges and future trends of uranium extraction from seawaters are proposed. This review provides the guideline for designing carbon-based materials with high adsorption capacity and exceptional selectivity for U(VI) extraction from seawater. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Marine Biofilms with Significant Corrosion Inhibition Performance by Secreting Extracellular Polymeric Substances
AB  - The development of environmentally friendly and sustainable corrosion protection technologies is a longstanding yet difficult problem, especially for the marine environment. The utilization of living biofilms isolated from local environments is an effective strategy for infrastructure protection. In this study, three aerobic marine bacteria, Tenacibaculum mesophilum D-6, Tenacibaculum litoreum W-4, and Bacillus sp. Y-6, with strong biofilmforming abilities were isolated and evaluated for the corrosion protection of X80 carbon steel. The corrosion inhibitory effect of the bacteria was found to be closely related to their biofilmforming abilities. This conclusion was corroborated by biofilm characterization, electrochemical tests, weight loss analysis, and corrosion product analysis. Moreover, secreted extracellular polymeric substances were identified to play significant roles in corrosion inhibition. Herein, we proposed a novel, eco-friendly, and cost-effective method for corrosion protection of carbon steels in the marine environment, providing guiding principles for identifying corrosion inhibitory bacteria from the local marine environment.

TI  - Adjustment of the natural ocean carbon cycle to negative emission rates
AB  - Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is the only geoengineering technique that allows negative emissions and the reduction of anthropogenic carbon in the atmosphere. Since the time scales of the global carbon cycle are largely driven by the exchanges with the natural oceanic stocks, the implementation of CDR actions is anticipated to create outgassing from the ocean that may reduce their efficiency. The adjustment of the natural carbon cycle to CDR was studied with a numerical Earth System Model, focusing on the oceanic component and considering two idealized families of CDR policies, one based on a target atmospheric concentration and one based on planned negative emissions. Results show that both actions are anticipated to release the anthropogenic carbon stored in the surface ocean, effectively increasing the required removal effort. The additional negative emissions are expected to be lower when the CDR policy is driven by planned removal rates without prescribing a target atmospheric CO2 concentration. Â© 2013 The Author(s).

TI  - Sustainable Underwater Solar Conversion Systems with Enhanced Electrode Environmental Compatibility
AB  - The exploitation and utilization of marine renewable resources is a significant component of marine environmental protection. Hence, a sustainable underwater energy supply system is required for related underwater devices such as environmental monitoring devices. Herein, we present an algae-inspired system that harnesses intermittent ocean solar energy to drive insertion/extraction processes of sodium ions from seawater to electrode materials for sustainable day-night energy supply. For this, we develop a combination of two optimization strategies for enhancing the environmental benignity of electrodes. The strategies include a polydopamine-assisted anchor technique to modify the Prussian blue (PB) electrode to prevent cyanide leakage. Also, a modified polyacrylonitrile-carbon felt (PAN-CF) was applied as a substitute for the MnO2 electrode to eliminate the presence of Mn metal in the water environment. After two modification strategies, the polydopamine coating technique can ensure almost no leakage of PB in the seawater. No dissolution of both the modified PB and Na-intercalated PB electrodes after being immersed can be found in authentic seawater for 4 months. Furthermore, the modified PB electrode and the PAN-CF electrode still show good electrochemical performance in day-night modes. Even after being used for 50 day-night cycles, the system still performed stably. These regulation strategies provide ideas for optimizing the environmental compatibility of electrode materials for other underwater battery systems. This is modified underwater solar conversion systems also showed other merits, such as the restoration of contaminated seawater, which promises their use as integrated devices for underwater energy supply and environmental restoration.

TI  - Sustainable energy harvesting and on-site disinfection of natural seawater using reverse electrodialysis
AB  - Seawater is a cost-effective and abundant electrolyte used as an electrode rinse solution to enable optimum utilization of reverse electrodialysis (RED). However, it is associated with several limitations, including the use of precious electrode materials, and its long-term stability must be addressed prior to its application in the field of seawater technology. In this context, a novel RED based on carbon electrodes was designed, and the experimental conditions were optimized for maximizing the harvesting of energy with aquaculture wastewater disinfection and recycling. The power obtained by RED, with a current density of 30 A/m2 and a flow rate of 424 mL/min, designed by response surface methodology, was in good agreement with the predicted maximum power density (0.64 W/m2). The treatment was sustainable, mainly due to an anodic reaction of electro-generated sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) under natural conditions, which afforded a high disinfection efficiency (above 99.5 Â± 0.2% within 1 min under continuous flow (pH 8)), even under real seawater conditions and in aquaculture wastewater. Simultaneously, a stable power of 0.1 Â± 0.03 W (0.25 Â± 0.07 W/m2) generated a reasonable specific energy (within 0.02 kWh/m3). Inorganic fouling was efficiently suppressed using a surface-modified carbon cathode for 680 h. Thus, the on-site seawater disinfection by RED described herein is practically feasible and could offer a sustainable and energy-efficient alternative to seawater recycling. Â© 2022

AB  - Rapid atomic power deployment may be possible without using fast breeder reactors or making undue demands on uranium resource. Using by-product D2O and thorium-U233 in CANDU and RBMK piles may circumvent need for either fast breeder reactors or seawater uranium. Atmospheric CO2 is presently increasing 2.25%/a (2.25 percent per year) in proportion to 2.25%/a exponential fossil fuel consumption increase. Roughly 1/3 anthropologic CO2 is removed by various sinks. CO2 removal is modeled as being proportional to 50-year-earlier CO2 amount above 280 ppm-C. Water electrolysis produces roughly 0.1 kg-D20/kWa. Material balance assumes each electrolysis stage increases D2O bottoms concentration times 3. Except for first electrolysis stage, all water from hydrogen consumption is returned to electrolysis. D2O enrichment from water electrolysis is augmented by using the resulting Hydrogen and Oxygen in fuel cells. Condensate from hydrogen consumption returns to the appropriate electrolysis stage. Fuel cell condensate originally from reformed natural gas may augment second-stage feed. Previously, recycling only hydrogen from combustion back to upper electrolysis stages allowed a 5%/a atomic power expansion. Using fuel-cells to augment upper-stage electrolysis enrichment increases atomic power expansion from 5%/a to 6%/a. Implementation of this process should start by 2020 to minimize peak atmospheric CO2 concentration to 850 ppm-C. Atomic power expansion is 6%/a, giving 45000 GW by 2100. World primary energy increases at the historic rate of 2.25%/a, exceeding 4000 EJ-thermal/a by 2100. J-electric ~ 3Jthermal. CO2 maximum is roughly 850 ppm-C around year 2100. CO2 declines back below 350 ppm-C by 2250 if the 50- year-delay seawater sink remains effective. The 15-year global temperature rise hiatus is apparently caused by convective heat transfer into seawater. Presumably convective CO2 transfer into seawater also occurs by the same mechanism. Each decade rapid atomic power expansion is delayed results in a 100 ppm increase in maximum atmospheric CO2 concentration. 50 TW dispatchable CSP (concentrated solar power), including 2 TWa storage, costs 1600 trillion USD and covers two Australias.
