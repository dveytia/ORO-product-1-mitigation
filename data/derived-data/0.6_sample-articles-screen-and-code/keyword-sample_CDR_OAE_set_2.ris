TI  - A painting type of flexible piezoelectric device for ocean energy harvesting
AB  - Energy harvesting using piezoelectric materials can be realised by periodic external force. Piezoelectric material directly converts strain energy into electric power to capture a wasted ambient kinetic energy. This recovered energy can be used for operating wireless sensors, such as those found in environmental monitoring, mechanical sensing and structural diagnostic. In our previous work, a flexible piezoelectric device, FPED, was proposed and developed as an energy harvester for generating electric power from flow-induced vibration in ocean and wind environments. In this study a FPED with a painted piezoelectric layer, highly durable in order to withstand extreme bending and weathering caused by waves and currents, is proposed and developed by spray coating for use as an ocean energy harvester. A numerical method is developed to predict electro-fluidâ€“structure interactions and to evaluate electrical performance and mechanical behaviours of the painted FPED. Additionally, validation of the numerical model is provided through several experimental tests. This study also investigates the relationship between the stiffness of the painted FPED and the vibrated frequency, as well as determining their influence on the electrical performance. Finally, the outcomes from a field test, conducted in real ocean space, is presented to provide information on electrical performance, mechanical behaviours and durability of painted FPEDs. The paper shows that a painted FPED is a useful and robust energy harvester for generating electric power from harsh environments. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Eddy compensation and controls of the enhanced sea-to-air CO2 flux during positive phases of the Southern Annular Mode
AB  - The current positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is thought to reduce the growth rate of the Southern Ocean CO2 sink because enhanced wind-driven upwelling of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) increases outgassing of natural CO2. However, no study to date has quantified the potentially large role of mesoscale eddies in compensating intensified upwelling nor the mixed-layer processes in terms of their effects on CO2 fluxes. Here we report on results from two new simulations in a regional 0.5 degrees eddying model of the Southern Ocean. The first simulation is forced with interannually varying atmospheric reanalysis and coupled to a biogeochemistry model run under constant preindustrial atmospheric CO2. The second simulation is like the first except that superimposed on the forcing is a poleward shifted and intensified westerlies wind anomaly consistent with the positive phase of the SAM. In response to the SAM, the Southern Ocean's sea-to-air CO2 flux is enhanced by 0.1PgCyr(-1) per standard deviation of the SAM, mostly from the Antarctic Zone (AZ), where enhanced surface DIC is only partly compensated by enhanced surface alkalinity. Increased mixed-layer DIC in the AZ results from a combination of increased upwelling below the mixed layer and increased vertical diffusion at the base of the mixed layer. Previous studies overlooked the latter. Thus, upward supply of DIC and alkalinity depends on associated vertical gradients just below the mixed layer, which are affected by interior ocean transport. Our eddying model study suggests that about one third of the SAM enhancement of the Ekman-induced northward DIC transport is compensated by southward transport from standing and transient eddies.

TI  - Design and evaluation of in-situ chemical regeneration of foam for enhanced oil recovery EOR, 1D foam modelling-Malaysia's Offshore Oilfield
AB  - Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) is one of the focus area for Malaysia's offshore oilfield (Yassin, A. A. M.: 1988, Hamdan M. K. et al: 2005 and Samsudin Y. et al: 2005) to unlock remaining oil inside the reservoir for recovery beyond waterflood, 30% (PE Hanbook, 1992), and as of January 2005, the average oil RF for Malaysia producing oil field is standing at 33% derived from 17.0 Bstb STOIIP, Samsudin, Y. et al (2005). The Malaysia's EOR processes studied were involved chemical, gas flooding and microbial which it has considered having the most practical aspects based on the characteristics of the oil; for light oils, facilities readiness and bundant of produced water and seawater. The most optimum EOR process is proposed for water-alternating-gas (WAG), Wan-Mohamad W.N. et al (2005) and Selamat S. B. et al (2008) and Abu Bakar M. et al (2011). This paper, is to provide an alternative solution for the WAG process by introducing chemicals into both water and gas slugs to further enhance displacement efficiencies. The study requirement was based on, firstly is to further enchance WAG process, secondly, WAG investment protection and thirdly, in overcoming the existing process of foam assisted WAG (FAWAG) limitations such as foam callapse and short propagation distances, Blaker T. et al (1999), Skauge A. et al (2002) and Aarra M.G. et al (2002) from Snorre field pilot experience. This process is called as an in-situ-FAWAG or icFAWAG and discussion focus is on 1D coreflood modelling, which the production matching quality is guided material balance under hybrid condition between alkali, acid and foam flooding. The production is derived from 1-meter coreflood or displacemnet result and meanwhile, the formulation (icFAWAG) properties are obtained from fluid-fluid result, tested in one of Malaysia oil producing field, which the field is undergoing WAG development. The physics and chemistry reactions was modeled using 2016 CMG STAR simulator. Amongst the key finding are, (1) the alternative process of foam flooding, icFAWAG formulation is capable to achieve higher oil recovery, 82.5% than WAG and FAWAG and this contributed by sweep efficiencies improvement, stable foam front, additional >5% RF, (2) reasonable material balance result was achieved based on average historical matching quality index (HMQI) result for oil, water, gas production and pressure, is at 0.5, and (3) Achieved fit-for-purpose icFAWAG modelling workflow and it consisted of 5 steps and the detail sub-workflows were established up-to level 3/4 descriptors. This workflow can be considered a hybrid process to cater 3 chemical reaction modelling; FAWAG (surfactant-gas), straight chemical flooding (A-SP) and acid. Â© 2018, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Seafloor weathering controls on atmospheric CO2 and global climate
AB  - Alteration of surficial marine basalts at low temperatures (<40 degrees C) is a potentially important sink for atmospheric CO2 over geologic time. Petrologic analyses, thermodynamic calculations, and experimental weathering results point to extensive Ca leaching and consumption of marine CO2 during alteration Basalt weathering in seawater-like solutions is sensitive to temperature. The activation energy for initial basalt weathering in seawater is 41-65 Kj mol(-1). If seafloor weathering temperatures are set by deep ocean fluids under high fluid to rock ratios the feedback between weathering and atmospheric CO2 is indirect, but sizeable. If the bulk of seafloor weathering occurs in the presence of low-temperature hydrothermal fluids, the weathering feedback depends on the linkage between spreading rates and heat flow. In either case, the primary linkage between seafloor weathering and the global carbon cycle appears to be thermal as opposed to chemical. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Technical and economical screening of chemical eor methods for theoffshore
AB  - Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and maximizing recovery from declining production fields remain a challengein the offshore industry. The challenge is to find an EOR method that is both technically and economicallyfeasible considering the high capital and operating costs in the offshore environment. The goal of thiswork was to conduct a simple cost-benefit analysis based on a technical, facility, and economical screeningof chemical EOR methods applicable to the offshore. Offshore Newfoundland, Canada is used as a basecase as it represents a challenging geographical environment. The reservoir properties are good, based onvolumetrics and characteristics, but the fields are located over 300 km offshore in a harsh environmentwhere operational costs are high. A data mining approach was used for the EOR screening process. Data from over one thousand coreflooding experiments investigating various chemical EOR methods, including surfactant, polymer, alkaline-surfactant (AS), alkaline-surfactant-polymer (ASP), nanoparticle, and low salinity water injection (LSWI),were collected. Factors with the greatest influence on the performance of a given EOR method werestatistically examined and discretized. The ranges of recovery factor, rock type, chemical concentrations,and the most commonly used chemicals are presented in this review paper. Economic factors examinedincluded capital expenditures (CAPEX) and the operating cost of production (OPEX). Benefits are foundto be strongly related to oil production and Brent crude oil forecasts. Sensitivity studies of the recoveryfactor ranges with the different chemical concentrations, net present values (NPV), and the influence of theinflation were all taken into consideration. Two different injection plans were considered: Injection fromday one of production, and injection after secondary production. The highest CAPEX and OPEX werecalculated for the ASP method, whereas LSWI resulted in the lowest. The results indicate that most ofthe chemical EOR methods could be economically successful, however, the timing of implementation willaffect the potential benefits. If high recovery and low chemical concentrations are considered, ASP floodingis the most successful chemical EOR method when injecting from day one. However, if the EOR methodstarts after a decline in production, surfactant flooding proves more beneficial, regardless of the scenarioconsidered. This paper presents a systematic approach to chemical EOR screening, combining availabletechnical data using a data analytics approach with economic and technical uncertainty.

TI  - Recent developments in surfactant flooding for carbonate reservoirs under harsh conditions
AB  - Surfactant flooding is one of the most promising chemical enhanced oil recovery techniques. However, this technique has been mainly applied in sandstone rocks with limited applications in carbonates. In this study, we present a comprehensive review on surfactant flooding for carbonates under harsh conditions of high temperature and high salinity. This review starts with highlighting the underlying mechanisms of surfactant flooding. Surfactant types, screening studies, and surfactant retention are then discussed. Laboratory and modeling works as well as field applications are also summarized. In addition, other surfactant applications such as surfactant-polymer, alkaline-surfactant-polymer, low salinity-surfactant as well as foams are presented. At the end of this paper, a list of recommendations and conclusions for better implementation of surfactants flooding are also discussed. This paper gives more insight into surfactant flooding aspects and its different applications in the petroleum industry. The literature review shows that a field-scale application of surfactant flooding in carbonates under high temperature and high salinity conditions is feasible. Also, this paper is considered as a guide for implementing potential projects on surfactant flooding in carbonates under harsh conditions. Copyright 2020, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - C-N-S synergy in a pilot-scale mainstream anammox fluidized-bed membrane bioreactor for treating chemically enhanced primary treatment saline sewage
AB  - Seawater for toilet flushing conserves the scarce freshwater resources in Hong Kong and similar densely-populated coastal cities. Saline sewage treatment using energy-efficient anammox-based processes appears to be beneficial, with notable potential for the future. However, the feasibility of this process remains uncharted, especially from its start-up to its steady-state cooperation. In this study, a pilot-scale mainstream anammox process was succeeded in a granular activated carbon fluidized-bed membrane bioreactor (FMBR) with only inoculating saline anaerobic digestion sludge. The FMBR, operating at the dissolved oxygen (DO) of 0.04-0.16 mg/L, achieved comparable nitrogen removal rates of 50.1-78.3 g N/m3/d while treating real chemically enhanced primary treatment saline sewage at 3.2 m3/d. Excluding Scalindua, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed a high abundance of common-freshwater-observed Kuenenia from 0.2\% (day 259) to 1.3\% (day 332) in biofilms. Nitrosomonas, responsible for ammonium oxidation, dominated in biofilms and accounted for 1.8\%-9.2\%. Nitrite oxidizing bacteria incursion happened unexpectedly, due to high oxygen exposure/supply from temporary on-site technical difficulties; however, NOB suppression was achieved by controlling DO at <0.16 mg/L, leading the FMBR's stability over the 343-day operation. Sulfate-reducing bacteria and sulfur-dependent denitrifiers propagated with high abundance, representing 14.0 +/- 10.6\% and 6.0 +/- 2.0\% in suspen-sions and 7.2 +/- 1.8\% and 15.9 +/- 2.3\% in biofilms, respectively. Further, metagenomic sequencing analysis indi-cated the C-N-S synergy of nitritation, anammox, sulfate reduction, and mixotrophic denitrification in the FMBR. Importantly, this research found that such a novel C-N-S synergy was made by the scavenges of hydrogen sulfide by Gammaproteobacteria sp. (B01 and B19) and Thioalkalispiraceae sp. (B03 and B04), species having ascendancy subsisting in the presence of oxygen owing to their aptitude of detoxifying reactive oxygen species. Knowledge gleaned from this study, as well as a complete set of pilot experimental data, could serve as a strong technical base for the larger-scale application of this process.

TI  - Oceanic CO2 outgassing and biological production hotspots induced by pre-industrial river loads of nutrients and carbon in a global modeling approach
AB  - Rivers are a major source of nutrients, carbon and alkalinity to the global ocean. In this study, we firstly estimate pre-industrial riverine loads of nutrients, carbon and alkalinity based on a hierarchy of weathering and terrestrial organic matter export models, while identifying regional hotspots of the riverine exports. Secondly, we implement the riverine loads into a global ocean biogeochemical model to describe their implications for oceanic nutrient concentrations, net primary production (NPP) and air-sea <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">CO2</span> fluxes globally, as well as in an analysis of coastal regions. Thirdly, we quantitatively assess the terrestrial origins and the long-term fate of riverine carbon in the ocean. We quantify annual bioavailable pre-industrial riverine loads of 3.7&thinsp;Tg P, 27&thinsp;Tg N, 158&thinsp;Tg Si and 603&thinsp;Tg C delivered to the ocean globally. We thereby identify the tropical Atlantic catchments (20&thinsp;% of global C), Arctic rivers (9&thinsp;% of global C) and Southeast Asian rivers (15&thinsp;% of global C) as dominant suppliers of carbon for the ocean. The riverine exports lead to a simulated net global oceanic <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">CO2</span> source of 231&thinsp;Tg C&thinsp;yr<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">-1</span> to the atmosphere, which is mainly caused by inorganic carbon (source of 183&thinsp;Tg C&thinsp;yr<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">-1</span>) and by organic carbon (source of 128&thinsp;Tg C&thinsp;yr<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">-1</span>) riverine loads. Additionally, a sink of 80&thinsp;Tg C&thinsp;yr<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">-1</span> is caused by the enhancement of the biological carbon uptake from dissolved inorganic nutrient inputs from rivers and the resulting alkalinity production. While large outgassing fluxes are simulated mostly in proximity to major river mouths, substantial outgassing fluxes can be found further offshore, most prominently in the tropical Atlantic. Furthermore, we find evidence for the interhemispheric transfer of carbon in the model; we detect a larger relative outgassing flux (49&thinsp;% of global riverine-induced outgassing) in the Southern Hemisphere in comparison to the hemisphere's relative riverine inputs (33&thinsp;% of global C inputs), as well as an outgassing flux of 17&thinsp;Tg C&thinsp;yr<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">-1</span> in the Southern Ocean. The addition of riverine loads in the model leads to a strong NPP increase in the tropical west Atlantic, Bay of Bengal and the East China Sea (<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">+</span>166&thinsp;%, <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">+</span>377&thinsp;% and <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">+</span>71&thinsp;%, respectively). On the light-limited Arctic shelves, the NPP is not strongly sensitive to riverine loads, but the <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">CO2</span> flux is strongly altered regionally due to substantial dissolved inorganic and organic carbon supplies to the region. While our study confirms that the ocean circulation remains the main driver for biogeochemical distributions in the open ocean, it reveals the necessity to consider riverine inputs for the representation of heterogeneous features in the coastal ocean and to represent riverine-induced pre-industrial carbon outgassing in the ocean. It also underlines the need to consider long-term <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">CO2</span> sources from volcanic and shale oxidation fluxes in order to close the framework's atmospheric carbon budget.

TI  - The impact of denitrification on the atmospheric CO2 uptake potential of seawater
AB  - In addition to carbonate dissolution, denitrification represents another pivotal geochemical process that produces alkalinity in the marine environment. Previous studies suggested that such alkalinity can increase seawater buffering capacity and thus enhance atmospheric CO2 uptake when the denitrifying water is exposed to the air in the coastal ocean. In this study, we explored the potential responses of seawater pCO(2) to denitrification through three approaches: (1) simulating pCO(2) variations in response to various denitrification scenarios, (2) verifying in situ pCO(2) data in a well-known denitrification ``hotbed{''}-the Arabian Sea-as well as in anammox-dominated oxygen minimum waters in the Eastern South Pacific, and (3) examining published benthic alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) flux ratios. In the first approach, we showed that the ratios of alkalinity and DIC addition during denitrification of different model compounds were lower than the slopes of alkalinity and DIC(Delta TA/Delta DIC) along a series of CO2 isopleths corresponding to modern-day xCO(2) at different temperatures. In the second approach, we showed that water pCO(2) level increased with loss of fixed nitrogen. Last, we showed that benthic alkalinity and DIC flux ratios were also lower than the Delta TA/Delta DIC values derived from the above mentioned CO2 isopleths. Overall, these independent approaches support the conclusion that denitrification-generated alkalinity (together with other alkalinity-altering anaerobic respiration pathways) may not be a notable driving force for enhancing atmospheric CO2 uptake, and concurrent DIC production during denitrification has to be taken into account when discussing changes in seawater buffering capacity along with alkalinity production.

TI  - Alkaline pretreatment of coastal bermudagrass for bioethanol production
AB  - Lignocellulosic materials are regarded as an alternative energy source for bioethanol production to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. Pretreatment is important for improving the enzymatic digestibility of lignocelluloses to increase the yield of fermentable sugars. Alkaline (sodium hydroxide and lime (calcium hydroxide)) pretreatment of coastal bermudagrass for enhanced reducing sugars recovery was investigated in this study. The effect of NaOH pretreatment at 121Â° C using 1%, 2% and 3% (w/v) NaOH for 15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes was evaluated first. Lower NaOH concentrations (0.5% and 0.75%) and lower temperatures (50, 80 and 100Â°C) were then examined. Lime (0.1 g Ca(OH) 2/g raw biomass) pretreatment of the biomass was conducted at room temperature, 50Â°C, 80Â°C, and 121Â°C. Total reducing sugars, glucose and xylose were analyzed. The optimal NaOH pretreatment conditions at 121Â°C for glucose and xylose production are 15 minutes and 0.75% NaOH. However, to maximize total reducing sugars production, pretreatment at 121Â°C for 30 minutes using 1 % NaOH is needed. The highest reducing sugars yield reached up to approximate 86% of theoretical maximum for NaOH pretreatment. Sodium hydroxide is more efficient than lime at 121Â°C for improved reducing sugars yield. Increasing temperature reduced the optimal pretreatment time at the same lime loading. The reducing sugars production under optimal pretreatment times was enhanced by 8% of theoretical maximum from room temperature to 80Â°C.

TI  - Nickel-doped tungsten oxide promotes stable and efficient hydrogen evolution in seawater
AB  - Hydrogen is considered as an efficient energy alternative, and the use of offshore wind power to electrolyze seawater to produce hydrogen will become the future model. Here, nickel-doped tungsten oxide is proposed to realize hydrogen production from seawater. Ni-WOx@NF was prepared experimentally, in which Ni was doped into WOx to replace part of the W sites. There is a volcanic relationship between the amount of Ni doping and the activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction. Particularly in alkaline seawater, Ni-WOx@NF only needs an overpotential of 45.69 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cmâˆ’2 and exhibits stability over 120 h. In addition, theoretical calculations confirmed that Ni doping can optimize the activity of hydrogen evolution reaction. This work proposes that nickel doping can enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction activity of tungsten oxide with excellent corrosion resistance, enabling it to work efficiently and stably in alkaline seawater.

TI  - Enhanced Rates of Regional Warming and Ocean Acidification After Termination of Large-Scale Ocean Alkalinization
AB  - Termination effects of large-scale artificial ocean alkalinization (AOA) have received little attention because AOA was assumed to pose low environmental risk. With the Max Planck Institute Earth system model, we use emission-driven AOA simulations following the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5). We find that after termination of AOA warming trends in regions of the Northern Hemisphere become similar to 50\% higher than those in RCP8.5 with rates similar to those caused by termination of solar geoengineering over the following three decades after cessation (up to 0.15K/year). Rates of ocean acidification after termination of AOA outpace those in RCP8.5. In warm shallow regions where vulnerable coral reefs are located, decreasing trends in surface pH double (0.01 units/year) and the drop in the carbonate saturation state (Omega) becomes up to 1 order of magnitude larger (0.2 units/year). Thus, termination of AOA poses higher risks to biological systems sensitive to fast-paced environmental changes than previously thought. Plain Language Summary Climate engineering (CE) methods are intended to alleviate the environmental perturbations caused by climate change and ocean acidification. However, these methods can also lead to environmental issues. Among all the different CE techniques, the method of artificial ocean alkalinization (AOA) is commonly discussed. AOA involves the release of processed alkaline minerals into the ocean, which enhances the uptake of atmospheric carbon by the ocean while reducing the acidification of seawater. We study the impacts caused by the termination of AOA on environmental properties that are relevant for organisms and ecosystems because they are sensitive not only to the magnitude of environmental change but also to its pace. We analyze the rate at which the environment changes after termination of this method using an Earth system model that simulates the response of our climate to CE. We found that the abrupt termination of large-scale implementation of AOA leads to regional rates of surface warming and ocean acidification, which largely exceed the pace of change that the implementation of AOA was intended to alleviate. This enhanced rate of environmental change would restrict even more the already limited adaptive capacity of vulnerable organisms and ecosystems.

TI  - Ocean Alkalinity, Buffering and Biogeochemical Processes
AB  - Alkalinity, the excess of proton acceptors over donors, plays a major role in ocean chemistry, in buffering and in calcium carbonate precipitation and dissolution. Understanding alkalinity dynamics is pivotal to quantify ocean carbon dioxide uptake during times of global change. Here we review ocean alkalinity and its role in ocean buffering as well as the biogeochemical processes governing alkalinity and pH in the ocean. We show that it is important to distinguish between measurable titration alkalinity and charge balance alkalinity that is used to quantify calcification and carbonate dissolution and needed to understand the impact of biogeochemical processes on components of the carbon dioxide system. A general treatment of ocean buffering and quantification via sensitivity factors is presented and used to link existing buffer and sensitivity factors. The impact of individual biogeochemical processes on ocean alkalinity and pH is discussed and quantified using these sensitivity factors. Processes governing ocean alkalinity on longer time scales such as carbonate compensation, (reversed) silicate weathering, and anaerobic mineralization are discussed and used to derive a close-to-balance ocean alkalinity budget for the modern ocean.

TI  - Gasification as possible technological solution for driftwood management in bodies of waters
AB  - This work studies the possibility of the thermochemical conversion, through gasification, of wood waste that accumulates along river bodies. Thanks to the startup SEADS (Sea Defense Solutions), tree branches were collected from the Lamone river (province of Ravenna - IT) in various conservation states. The wood wastes were pre-treated through a chipping process to make them suitable for chemical/physical analyses and subsequent gasification process using the All Power Labs Power Pallet 30 (PP30) commercial micro-gasifier. The elemental analysis show how the wood material undergoes a certain chemical degradation due to weathering, which leads to an HHV of 18.76 MJ/kg, lower than virgin biomass. The gasification process was firstly simulated through a numerical method that gave positive outputs: syngas with a higher heating value of 4.61 MJ/kg and a gasification efficiency of 63.03%. A subsequent gasification test was used to validate the numerical model that was also used to estimate the electrical (18.91%) and thermal (25.21%) efficiency of a cogeneration power plant, powered by the PP30 gasification reactor.

TI  - Self-Powered Seawater Electrolysis Based on a Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Hydrogen Production
AB  - Water splitting for yielding high-purity hydrogen represents the ultimate choice to reduce carbon dioxide emission owing to the superior energy density and zero-pollution emission after combustion. However, the high electricity consumption and requirement of large quantities of pure water impede its large-scale application. Here, a triboelectric nanogenerator (W-TENG) converting offshore wind energy into electricity is proposed for commercial electric energy saving and cost reduction. By introducing PTFE/POM dielectric pairs with matched HOMO/LUMO band gap energy, a high charge density is achieved to promote the output of W-TENG. With the impedance matching design of transformers with the internal resistance of W-TENG, the output current is further enhanced from 1.42 mA to 54.5 mA with a conversion efficiency of more than 92.0%. Furthermore, benefiting from the high electrocatalytic activity (overpotential = 166 mV and Tafel slope = 181.2 mV dec-1) of a carbon paper supported NiCoP-MOF catalyst, natural seawater can be adopted as a resource for in situ hydrogen production without acid or alkaline additives. Therefore, the self-powered seawater electrolysis system achieves a H2production rate as high as 1273.9 Î¼L min-1m-2with a conversion efficiency of 78.9%, demonstrating a more practical strategy for conversion of wind energy into renewable hydrogen energy.

TI  - Adding maize cobs to vertical subsurface flow constructed wetlands treating marine recirculating aquaculture system effluents: Carbon releasing kinetics and intensified nitrogen removal
AB  - This study aims to investigate the releasing behaviors of maize cobs with or without alkali (i.e. NaOH) pretreatment in seawater and distilled water, and to evaluate the effects of maize cobs addition (solid biomass and lixivium) on nitrogen removal in saline constructed wetland (CW) treating marine recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) effluents. Results revealed NaOH-treated maize cobs released carbon more efficiently, whether in seawater or in distilled water. Compared to distilled water, seawater conditions promoted carbon releasing. CW with maize cobs biomass and lixivium addition had high NO3-N removal efficiencies without significant difference, i.e. 94.9 Â± 6.0% and 87.1 Â± 13.2%, respectively.

TI  - The search for onshore analogues for the offshore Upper Cretaceous Chalk of the North Sea
AB  - Suitable onshore analogues for offshore wind-farm turbine foundations in the Chalk of the North Sea would be invaluable. Such foundations require examples of near surface weathering illustrating both glacial and periglacial Quaternary processes as well as lithology and tectonic structure of the Chalk. From the Cenomanian to Early Campanian, the coast of East Yorkshire illustrates hard, high density, glacially eroded chalks similar to those found immediately offshore. Higher in the Campanian offshore East Yorkshire, younger, low density chalks, not present onshore, have been found (the Westermost Rough Member). In contrast, north Norfolk and its coastal cliffs provide examples of soft, high porosity, part glacially and part periglacially weathered chalks. Complex sedimentary structures seen in offshore seismic sections are similar to those on the French coast of the Pays de Caux. These coastal sections are compared with results from offshore wind farm ground investigations. Seismic sections illustrate Quaternary channels cutting into the Chalk and a landscape of hills and valleys similar to the onshore Wolds. High resolution 2D digital seismic sections, combined with cored boreholes, provide the evidence for applying the detailed Chalk lithostratigraphy to the offshore southern North Sea and illustrate the relationship between tectonic structure and sedimentation in the Chalk. The map for the offshore extension of Chalk provinces is revised, with Transitional Province lithologies typical of the Chiltern Hills and East Anglia, extending north-eastwards from Norfolk into the Dowsing Fault zone. Geotechnical properties are related to the buried offshore Chalk landscape as well as to Chalk lithostratigraphy. Â© 2015 The Geologists' Association.

TI  - Kelp beds and their local effects on seawater chemistry, productivity, and microbial communities
AB  - Kelp forests are known as key habitats for species diversity and macroalgal productivity; however, we know little about how these biogenic habitats interact with seawater chemistry and phototroph productivity in the water column. We examined kelp forest functions at three locales along the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state by quantifying carbonate chemistry, nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton productivity, and seawater microbial communities inside and outside of kelp beds dominated by the canopy kelp species Nereocystis luetkeana and Macrocystis pyrifera. Kelp beds locally increased the pH, oxygen, and aragonite saturation state of the seawater, but lowered seawater inorganic carbon content and total alkalinity. Although kelp beds depleted nitrate and phosphorus concentrations, ammonium and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were enhanced. Kelp beds also decreased chlorophyll concentrations and carbon fixed by phytoplankton, although kelp carbon fixation more than compensated for any difference in phytoplankton production. Kelp beds entrained distinct microbial communities, with higher taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity compared to seawater outside of the kelp bed. Kelp forests thus had significant effects on seawater chemistry, productivity and the microbial assemblages in their proximity. Thereby, the diversity of pathways for carbon and nitrogen cycling was also enhanced. Overall, these observations suggest that the contribution of kelp forests to nearshore carbon and nitrogen cycling is greater than previously documented. Â© 2019 by the Ecological Society of America

TI  - Characteristics of hydrogen production with carbon storage by CO2-rich hydrothermal alteration of olivine in the presence of Mg-Al spinel
AB  - Artificial control of olivine alteration has potential applications for both H-2 production and CO2 reduction (by mineralization and hydrogenation). To explore methods to overcome the still-constrained olivine alteration problem, olivine + spinel alteration experiments were performed with the addition of Mg-Al spinel in CO2-rich (0.5 M NaHCO3) solution under hydrothermal conditions (300 degrees C and 10 MPa). Mg-Al spinel enhanced olivine serpentinization significantly (more than 2 times), and generation of both H-2 and CO2 hydrogenation products was accelerated (up to 3 times) with >= 10 wt\% Mg-Al spinel especially at the latter stage of the 72 h reaction. Mineral measurements revealed that more Al released from Mg-Al spinel was incorporated into Al-serpentine by the replacement of Fe with higher Mg-Al spinel content. Both Al and Fe incorporated into Al-serpentine were released as the reaction proceeded. Thus, H-2 production was elevated with the presence of a large amount Mg-Al spinel at the latter stage of the reaction. HCO3 played an important role in the promotion of Mg-Al spinel dissolution with the release of Al, which was stored in magnesite after being utilized. This study also suggests that the presence of Mg-Al spinel (5-20 wt\%) in the starting mineral does not have significant influence on the total H-2 yield from olivine alteration over the entire operation period.

TI  - The quality of a CO2 repository: What is the sufficient retention time of CO2 stored underground
AB  - This study develops a tool to determine the minimum retention time required for underground storage Of CO2 if credits should be awarded to an operator of a CO2 injection project. A climate model has been established that relates climate change to escaping CO2 from possible large-scale deposits. The model does not only feature the carbon sinks that are usually accounted for in climate modelling (uptake Of CO2 in terrestrial biomass due to the fertilisation effect and uptake into the ocean), but also sinks effective on a much longer time-scale, i.e. seabed absorption and carbonate rock weathering, which have time-constants of several thousand years. The model has been tested on different escape scenarios with varying residence time and different reservoir performance. The results suggest that the minimum average residence time in the typical reservoirs should be at least 10 000 years if the impact of leaking CO2 on the climate should be avoided for coming generations.

TI  - Atmospheric CO2 over the Past 66 Million Years from Marine Archives
AB  - Throughout Earth's history, CO2 is thought to have exerted a fundamental control on environmental change. Here we review and revise CO2 reconstructions from boron isotopes in carbonates and carbon isotopes in organic matter over the Cenozoic-the past 66 million years. We find close coupling between CO2 and climate throughout the Cenozoic, with peak CO2 levels of similar to 1,500 ppm in the Eocene greenhouse, decreasing to similar to 500 ppm in the Miocene, and falling further into the ice age world of the Plio-Pleistocene. Around two-thirds of Cenozoic CO2 drawdown is explained by an increase in the ratio of ocean alkalinity to dissolved inorganic carbon, likely linked to a change in the balance of weathering to outgassing, with the remaining onethird due to changing ocean temperature and major ion composition. Earth system climate sensitivity is explored and may vary between different time intervals. The Cenozoic CO2 record highlights the truly geological scale of anthropogenic CO2 change: Current CO2 levels were last seen around 3 million years ago, and major cuts in emissions are required to prevent a return to the CO2 levels of the Miocene or Eocene in the coming century. CO2 reconstructions over the past 66 Myr from boron isotopes and alkenones are reviewed and re-evaluated. CO2 estimates from the different proxies show close agreement, yielding a consistent picture of the evolution of the ocean-atmosphere CO2 system over the Cenozoic. CO2 and climate are coupled throughout the past 66 Myr, providing broad constraints on Earth system climate sensitivity. Twenty-first-century carbon emissions have the potential to return CO2 to levels not seen since the much warmer climates of Earth's distant past.

TI  - Assessing the influence of ocean alkalinity enhancement on a coastal phytoplankton community
AB  - Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) is a proposed method to counteract climate change by increasing the alkalinity of the surface ocean and thus the chemical storage capacity of seawater for atmospheric CO2. The impact of OAE on marine ecosystems, including phytoplankton communities which make up the base of the marine food web, is largely unknown. To investigate the influence of OAE on phytoplankton communities, we enclosed a natural plankton community from coastal Tasmania for 22gÂ¯d in nine microcosms during a spring bloom. Microcosms were split into three groups, (1) the unperturbed control, (2) the unequilibrated treatment where alkalinity was increased (+495gÂ¯Â±gÂ¯5.2gÂ¯Î¼molgÂ¯kg-1) but seawater CO2 was not in equilibrium with atmospheric CO2, and (3) the equilibrated treatment where alkalinity was increased (+500gÂ¯Â±gÂ¯3.2gÂ¯Î¼molgÂ¯kg-1) and seawater CO2 was in equilibrium with atmospheric CO2. Both treatments have the capacity to increase the inorganic carbon sink of seawater by 21gÂ¯%. We found that simulated OAE had significant but generally moderate effects on various groups in the phytoplankton community and on heterotrophic bacteria. More pronounced effects were observed for the diatom community where silicic acid drawdown and biogenic silica build-up were reduced at increased alkalinity. Observed changes in phytoplankton communities affected the temporal trends of key biogeochemical parameters such as the organic matter carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. Interestingly, the unequilibrated treatment did not have a noticeably larger impact on the phytoplankton (and heterotrophic bacteria) community than the equilibrated treatment, even though the changes in carbonate chemistry conditions were much more severe. This was particularly evident from the occurrence and peak of the phytoplankton spring bloom during the experiment, which was not noticeably different from the control. Altogether, the inadvertent effects of increased alkalinity on the coastal phytoplankton communities appear to be rather limited relative to the enormous climatic benefit of increasing the inorganic carbon sink of seawater by 21gÂ¯%. We note, however, that more detailed and widespread investigations of plankton community responses to OAE are required to confirm or dismiss this first impression. Â© Copyright:

TI  - Repeated exposure to simulated marine heatwaves enhances the thermal tolerance in pearl oysters
AB  - In an era of unprecedented climate change, marine heatwaves (MHWs) are projected to increase in frequency, intensity, and duration, severely affecting marine organisms and fisheries and causing profound ecological and socioeconomic impacts. However, very little is known about effects of MHWs on ecologically and economically important bivalve species. Here, we investigate how pearl oysters, Pinctada maxima (Jameson), respond to MHWs under various simulated scenarios. Acute 3-day exposure to MHWs, mimicked by increasing the ambient seawater temperature from 24Â°C to 28Â°C, 32Â°C, and 36Â°C, respectively, induced significant changes (initially sustained increase and late decrease) in activities of antioxidant enzymes (GSH-Px, SOD, CAT, MDA, and T-AOC) and biomineralizaiton-related enzymes (AKP and ACP). Likewise, energy-metabolizing enzymes (NKA, CMA, and T-ATP) showed remarkable acute responses, with significant increases occurring at the beginning and end of thermal exposure. Following repeated exposure to MHWs, without exception, acute responses of assayed enzymes to MHWs were significantly alleviated, implying that pearl oysters have the ability to implement more efficient and less costly energy-utilizing strategies to compensate for thermal stress induced physiological interferences. These findings indicate that marine bivalves can respond plastically and acclimate rapidly to MHWs and pave the way for predicting the fate of this important taxonomic groups in rapidly changing oceans.

TI  - Effects of biochar addition to estuarine sediments
AB  - Biochar is a carbon-rich product, able to enhance soil fertility and mitigate CO2 emissions. While biochar effects on agriculture are becoming known, its impact elsewhere, e.g., on estuarine ecosystems, has yet to be assessed. The main aim of the present study was to determine the effect of biochar on sediment-water retention, CO2 emissions from sedimentary organic carbon decomposition, sediment pH and electrical conductivity, in aerobic conditions similar to those observed at low tide. Sediments from the Mondego Estuary (Portugal) were mixed with pine gasification biochar at different doses (5, 10, 14 \%) and immersed in water with different salinity values (15, 25, 30) for 96 h. The influence of biochar on water retention, the residence time of water and CO2 emissions between -0.75 and -1.5 MPa, total organic carbon, pH and electrical conductivity (EC) were determined. Carbon chemical composition and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations were determined in sediments and biochar. Differences between biochar treatments after immersion in different water salinities were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results showed that biochar was able to (a) increase sediment-water content in terms of quantity and residence time, (b) decrease CO2 emissions, but only with a specific soil-water content and at the highest biochar dose, (c) increase sediment pH at all biochar doses and (d) increase sediment EC at the highest biochar dose. In contrast, the percentage of carbon mineralised was not modified. Biochar carbon was rich in PAHs and less decomposable than sedimentary carbon. The increments observed in sediment pH and EC were unable to change sediment alkaline or saline status according to standard classifications. Our results suggest that the remarkable water adsorption capacity of biochar-sediment mixtures may be considered the main factor in regulating CO2 emission rates from sediments, together with high PAH concentrations, which probably restrain the organic matter decomposition process.

TI  - A critical review of water chemistry alteration technologies to develop novel water treatment schemes for smartwater flooding in carbonate reservoirs
AB  - The importance of tuning injection water chemistry for upstream is getting beyond formation damage control/water incompatibility to increase oil recovery from waterflooding and different improved oil recovery (IOR)/enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes. The water chemistry requirements for IOR/EOR have been relatively addressed in the recent literature, but the key challenge for field implementation is to find an easy, practical, and optimum technology to tune water chemistry. The currently available technologies for tuning water chemistry are limited, and most of the existing ones are adopted from the desalination industry, which relies on membrane based separation. Even though these technologies yield a doable solution, they are not the optimum choice to alter injection water chemistry in terms of incorporating selective ions and providing effective water management for large scale applications. In this study, several of the current, emerging, and future desalination technologies are reviewed with an objective to develop potential water treatment solutions that can most efficiently alter injection water chemistry for SmartWater flooding in carbonate reservoirs. Standard chemical precipitation technologies, such as lime/soda ash, alkali, and lime/aluminum based reagent, are only applicable for removing certain ions from seawater. The lime/aluminum based reagent process looks interesting, as it can remove both sulfates and hardness ions to provide some tuning flexibility for key ions included in the SmartWater. There are some new technologies under development that use chemical solvents to extract salt ions from seawater, but their capabilities to selectively remove specific ions need further investigation. Forward osmosis and membrane distillation are the two emerging technologies, and these can provide good alternatives to reverse osmosis seawater desalination for the near-term. These technologies can offer a better cost-effective solution where there is availability of low grade waste heat or steam. The two new desalination technologies, based on dynamic vapor recovery and carrier gas extraction, are well suited to treat high salinity produced water for zero liquid discharge (ZLD). These technologies may not be able to provide an economical solution for seawater desalination. Carbon nanotube desalination, graphene sheet-based desalination, and capacitive deionization are the three potential future seawater desalination technologies identified for the long term. Among these, carbon nanotube based desalination is much attractive, although the technology is still largely under research and development. This review study results show that there is no commercial technology yet available to selectively remove specific ions from seawater in one step and optimally meet desired water chemistry requirements of SmartWater flooding. As a result, different novel schemes involving selected combinations of chemical precipitation, conventional/emerging desalination, and produced water treatment technologies are proposed. These schemes represent both approximate and improved solutions to selectively incorporate specific key ions in the SmartWater, besides presenting the key opportunities to treat produced water/membrane rejects and provide ZLD capabilities in SmartWater flooding applications. The developed novel schemes can provide an attractive solution to capitalize on existing huge produced water resources in Saudi reservoirs to generate SmartWater and minimize wastewater disposal during field-wide implementation.

TI  - Internal ketone sulfonate: A new bio-sourced surfactant for chemical EOR in sea water
AB  - Surfactant Chemical EOR is a proven technology to increase oil recovery with several successful field trials. Offshore trials are less frequent due to the complexity of operations and also because of the limited availability of suitable chemicals adapted to sea water. For using classic anionic surfactants offshore, pretreatment of the water for reducing salinity or the use of alkali are required. In either case an additional unit has to be added to the platform, raising the price of oil production. The structure of the surfactant can be modified for sea water, using ethylene/propylene/butylene and their derivatives to prepare surfactants that are branched and sometimes extended. However sourcing can be an issue due to limitations on production sites. Internal Ketone Sulfonates (IKS) are new bio-sourced surfactants particularly suitable for chemical EOR in sea water. They are a good alternative to petro-derived chemicals with improved raw material availability and carbon footprint. Solubility is proved for TDS higher than 48g/L TDS in synthetic sea water. Phase behavior and low interfacial tensions were evaluated with classical Winsor analysis. Interfacial tension of 3.5*10âˆ’4 mN/m between the IKS formulation and dodecane was reached at the optimal salinity of 31 g/L TDS (R+=0.13) for a temperature of 60Â°C. The formulation was tested for oil recovery under dynamic porous media conditions and allowed to recover RF = 99% (+/-1.7%) after water flood. Copyright Â© 2019, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - Static adsorption of amphoteric surfactant
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the maximum amphoteric surfactant adsorption by studying parameters like rock type, salinity, alkali type, alkali concentration and surfactant concentration and to evaluate optimum parameters that would provide minimum amphoteric surfactant adsorption. The amphoteric surfactant was studied had been tested in Malaysiaâ€™s first chemical enhanced oil recovery (CEOR) pilot in Angsi Field. Hence, it is very important to properly understand the adsorption mechanism, parameters and potential for this surfactant to reduce uncertainty. First rock samples were characterized. Existing static adsorption methodogy was being improved to reduce redundant samples and long experiments duration to produce repeatable results. Then, actual experiments with varying adsorption parameters were carried out. Amphoteric adsorption increased when clay content of reservoir rock increase and so did the surface area. Alkali had been demonstrated to significantly decrease adsorption of amphoteric surfactants and a novel kind of alkali, organic alkali and ammonia are introduced with advantages of lowering adsorption better than the conventional alkali (sodium carbonate). The dynamic adsorption experiments were performed by injecting the chemical solution through reservoir core until an equilibrium state was reached. The dynamic method better described the adsorption process and the result was more reliable. Dynamic adsorptions were about 10 to 13 times lower than static adsorption. Further studies incorporating surface area, grain size, accessible pore volume and mineralogy including clay type were required to build robust correlation from static to dynamic adsorption.

TI  - Potential of biochar and organic amendments for reclamation of coastal acidic-salt affected soil
AB  - Salinity and acidity have affected several hundred million hectares of land throughout the globe which poses a major threat to global food security and biodiversity. Application of organic amendments for salt-affected soils has been identified as one of the most effective ways to mitigate salinity-induced problems and considered as a green technique offering twin benefits of waste load reduction and land reclamation. However, studies on reclaiming acidic-salt affected soils are limited. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the reclamation potential of biochars and organic amendments involving Gliricidia sepium biochar produced at 300 degrees C, 500 degrees C, and 700 degrees C, green waste compost, and municipal sewage sludge at three different amendment ratios, 1.0\%, 2.5\% and 5.0\%. The incubation experiment was conducted for a 4-month period with different amendment ratios applied to the coastal acidic-salt affected soil. Subsamples were extracted from incubation pots after 1 and 4 months and analyzed for soil chemical parameters (pH, EC, NO3-, PO43-, total organic carbon, cation exchange capacity, sodium adsorption ratio, exchangeable sodium percentage) and microbial enzyme activity (catalase activity, and acid- and alkaline phosphatase activity). All organic amendments demonstrated enhancement of the soil properties in a significant manner. However, increasing incubation time and amendment ratio increase the changes of soil parameters by a great percentage. Therefore, the maximum amendment ratio of 5.0\% and 4 months of incubation period rendered a significant improvement in the reclamation of acidic-salt affected soil. However, the biochar produced at 500 degrees C contributed the maximum towards the improved physicochemical and biochemical profile of acidic-salt affected soil, making it the most promising organic amendment for the reclamation of acidic-salt affected soil. The overall reclamation efficiency of organic amendments registered the following order of variation: 700 BC<Sludge<300 BC<Compost<500 BC.

TI  - Evaluating chemical EOR potential of St Joseph Field, offshore Malaysia
AB  - This paper presents a systematic evaluation of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) potentials for St Joseph Field located in the offshore Malaysia. The field has been in production for 30 years, currently under gas injection and started injecting water in March 2011. Chemical EOR (cEOR) was identified as the most effective EOR process for maximizing ultimate recovery for St Joseph and the two nearby fields. This paper presents the key results of the St Joseph chemical EOR feasibility evaluation. It also discusses an integrated area development concept exploiting the synergies between the three fields of North Sabah, which is recognized as key to a successful cEOR development in the area. This study aimed to understand the size of prize in case of both polymer flood and Alkaline-Surfactant-Polymer (ASP) EOR scenarios using 3D full field models. One dimensional box and single well models were used to understand the physics of the EOR processes whereas the full field model was used to investigate the EOR subsurface development concepts, infill opportunities, injector/producer placements, slug size etc. It is anticipated that the proposed ASP flood will increase the ultimate recovery factor for the EOR targeted sands to circa 65%. Potential subsurface risks/uncertainties were also investigated. The chemical EOR process will involve handling a large volume of chemicals. This represents a major challenge in application of chemical EOR technologies in an offshore environment like St Joseph. Various facilities concepts were examined in detail. The selected concept is a combination of a mobile floating facility for the injection water treatment and chemical injection packages and a platform-based facility for processing the produced fluids/chemical. A pilot injection prior to full implementation has been planned to manage key subsurface/surface uncertainties and main challenges. The detailed studies of the pilot design and implementation are presented in a separate paper. Copyright 2011, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - Pre-flush design for extended scale inhibitor squeeze lifetime in limestone reservoir - Laboratory investigations and cost benefit analysis
AB  - Scale inhibitor (SI) squeeze treatment is an established practice in offshore fields to prevent inorganic scale deposition in the wellbore and near wellbore formation. Squeeze lifetime is measured by the duration for which the concentration of the chemical is released at a concentration above the required minimum inhibitor concentration (MIC). Hence, maximizing SI adsorption to the pore surfaces may proportionately enhance squeeze lifetime. However, most oil-field squeeze scale inhibitors being aqueous-based, it is unlikely to get optimum adsorption on an oil-wet formation due to unfavorable rock surface condition. This work is targeted towards optimum formation conditioning through an intelligently designed pre-flush treatment; so that the adsorption and lifetime of SI in an oil-wet carbonate reservoir are significantly improved. Eco-friendly APG surfactants are evaluated with and without alkali and co-surfactants to design the pre-flush composition. A series of coreflood experiments are conducted in simulated reservoir conditions, using data and materials from a high temperature carbonate oil reservoir from the Middle-East. The results are evaluated in light of IFT and phase behavior and changes of rock wettability due to pre-flush treatment. The results show that SI squeeze lifetime can be enhanced by as much as 240% when compared to conventional treatment and it has a direct correlation with wettability index and IFT. Anionic surfactant may look more attractive than nonionic surfactant due to favorable wettability alteration and highly reduced IFT, however they may not be the right choice for carbonate formation due to higher adsorption and competition with scale inhibitor molecules. Cost benefit analysis evince that introduction of the newly designed pre-flush treatment would results in improved economics through reduced treatment frequency, leading to minimized well intervention and consequent production loss. Not enough attention is given on the design/optimization of pre-flush and conditioning of the formation to be used as adsorbent/storehouse of the inhibiting chemical in preferentially oil wet carbonate formations. The applicability of surfactant-alkaline has been long established as means of EOR mechanism but they are rarely investigated for near wellbore treatments to maximize chemical storage and placement; which is what this work has studied.

TI  - Downtime analysis of FPSO
AB  - Hydrocarbons remain the most important fuel in todayâ€™s world despite recent depreciaÂ­tion in their economic value and continuous developments in the use of alternative sources of energy such as solar power. The Organization for Economic Cooperation Development (OECD) predicts a bounce back in the value of hydrocarbons in coming years which implies that there will be more exploration, offshore drilling and production of hydrocarbons worldwide. Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessels have been widely used for these operations due to their cost effectiveness especially in remote areas. The oil produced from an FPSO can be transported to the mainland by the use of tankers and the offloading process from FPSO to tanker can be affected by weather conditions. Hence, a rigorous downtime analysis for the offloading operation has to be conducted to ensure crew safety and to maximize production. A simplified method for analysing the weather downtime on a turret moored FPSO and the tandem offloading process is presented in this paper and the workability for both vessels is presented.

The fact of agro-waste rapid growth has become centre of this research. Also, problem induced by filtration loss into the formation encourages research in this study. The formulation for the mud were prepared by using the standard mixture and added with different concentration of plantain peel starch. The novelty of this study is the investigation on the effect of microwave treatment on the properties of plantain peels starch which affects the performance of the drilling fluid. The influence of the non-ionizing microwave effect on starch changed the physical and chemical properties by the disintegrated intermolecular bonding of the starch particles. Microwave heating reduced the moisture content of the starch by 81% due to rapid heat transfer within the starch granule. The water binding capacity of the starch has increased by 42.4% as compared to the non-microwaved starch. The swelling power curve increased to the factor of 3 and as temperature reaching 80?C the factor reduced to 1.5. Solubility curve of microwaved starch is on the other hand lays below the non-microwaved curve shows that microwave irradiation decreased the solubility of the starch. Next, the performance of mud is evaluated with the presence of different concentration of native and microwave irradiated starch. Plantain peel starch did not affect the mud weight. The starch additives did not alter the pH and the mud pH is in the accepted alkali range. The starch concentration is directly affecting the viscosity of the mud. The presence of the starch in the mud enhanced the viscosity of the mud and also the yield point which favours the drilling operation as yield point indicates the ability of mud to transport cutting to the surface. Simultaneously, gel strength of the mud also improved with the presence of plantain peel starch and further enhanced with the presence of microwaved irradiated starch. In addition, plantain peel starch improved the fluid loss volume and further ameliorated the fluid loss when the microwave-treated starch added in the mixtures.

TI  - Carbonate weathering, CO2 redistribution, and Neogene CCD and pCO2 evolution
AB  - The carbonate compensation depth (CCD), 513C of marine carbonate, atmospheric pCO2 and major ion composition of seawater provide constraints on how geological carbon cycle processes evolved over the Neogene. I use simple models and the LOSCAR ocean carbon system model to assess what changes in carbon fluxes to the ocean are necessary to explain observations since the early Miocene. The calculations consider estimates of early Miocene seawater temperatures and ion composition and a range of possible pCO2. Changes in shelf-basin partition could explain up to approximate to 45\% the observed CCD deepening. Increased carbonate flux (likely range 28 +/- 12\%) to the oceans is necessary to explain the rest. Despite changes in pCO2 from early Miocene values of 450-900 ppm to a pre-anthropogenic value of 280 ppm, the size of the total ocean-atmosphere carbon reservoir shows only moderate or no net change, implying that weathering and/or organic carbon burial result in little net CO2 consumption. Decreasing Ca++ and increasing deepwater carbonate saturation over the Neogene require a large increase in deepwater CO3= and leads to decreasing DIC/TALK which is the main driver for falling pCO2. The primary driver of pCO2 reduction is redistribution of CO2 from the atmosphere to the oceans, not net removal of CO2 from excess silicate weathering or organic carbon burial. The main impact of tectonic perturbation of the carbon cycle during the Neogene is to enhance carbonate weathering while only weakly affecting the net balance of degassing vs. silicate weathering or kerogen oxidation vs. organic carbon burial.(c) 2022 The Author.

TI  - Defluidization Prediction and Prevention during Cocombustion of ReEngineered Feedstock with Coal in a Bubbling Fluidized Bed Combustor
AB  - Despite the increase in applications of renewable energy sources, coal combustion for electricity production remains important. The use of alkali and alkaline earth sorbents to address the emissions or their introduction during cocombustion of biomass can cause defluidization of fluidized bed combustors. This article presents the results obtained from an extensive experimental campaign aimed at exploring the performance of different defluidization inhibition measures and defluidization outcomes of a pilot-scale atmospheric bubbling fluidized bed combustor cofired with ReEngineered Feedstock (ReEF) and coal. ReEF is a solid fuel made from the nonrecyclable fraction of municipal solid waste to which alkaline air emission control reagents are physically bound. The cocombustion of coal and ReEF combines fuel- A nd sorbent-blending techniques for improved combustion and higher efficiency emission reduction. An earlier study of the group proved these favorable aspects during the cocombustion of a granular bituminous coal and ReEF in a pilot-scale bubbling fluidized bed combustor of coarse silica sand particles. However, some formulations of ReEF led to the bed defluidization during the 800-1000 Â°C operation. In the first phase of the current study, the performance of different counteractive/pre-emptive measures to delay/prevent the defluidization incidents during the coal-ReEF cocombustion trials in the same combustor unit was examined. Although the application of counteractive measures, e.g., a decrease in the operating temperature and an increase in the superficial gas velocity, could delay the defluidization incident, replacing coarse silica with olivine sand significantly extended the temperature range of operation without defluidization. In the second phase of the current study, employing the more commonly used coarse silica sand, the cocombustion of bituminous coal with over 50 ReEF formulations was performed to explore defluidization outcomes in the 800-1000 Â°C range. The data collected from these trials illustrated trends that could be presented as a defluidization map. The map relates the sodium and calcium composition limits for the ReEF that would defluidize a bed of coarse silica at different temperature levels. The defluidization boundaries obtained at 900 and 1000 Â°C were described by adopting an empirical formulation. Extrapolation, following an Arrhenius type temperature dependency, over the 800-1100 Â°C range in 50 Â°C increments showed acceptable predictability of the approach, satisfying the industrial requirements. The applicability of the predictive tool, developed on the basis of 1 h of operation at each operating temperature, was subsequently tested over extended periods (>8 h) at 850 Â°C.

TI  - Impacts of artificial ocean alkalinization on the carbon cycle and climate in Earth system simulations
AB  - Using the state-of-the-art emissions-driven Max Planck Institute Earth system model, we explore the impacts of artificial ocean alkalinization (AOA) with a scenario based on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) framework. Addition of 114 Pmol of alkalinity to the surface ocean stabilizes atmospheric CO2 concentration to RCP4.5 levels under RCP8.5 emissions. This scenario removes 940 GtC from the atmosphere and mitigates 1.5 K of global warming within this century. The climate adjusts to the lower CO2 concentration preventing the loss of sea ice and high sea level rise. Seawater pH and the carbonate saturation state (Î©) rise substantially above levels of the current decade. Pronounced differences in regional sensitivities to AOA are projected, with the Arctic Ocean and tropical oceans emerging as hot spots for biogeochemical changes induced by AOA. Thus, the CO2 mitigation potential of AOA comes at a price of an unprecedented ocean biogeochemistry perturbation with unknown ecological consequences. Â©2016. American Geophysical Union.

TI  - Impacts of CaO Solid Particles in Carbon Dioxide Absorption Process from Ship Emission with NaOH Solution
AB  - CO2 emitted from ship exhaust is one of the major sources of atmospheric pollution. In order to reduce ship CO2 emissions, this paper comes up with the idea of recovering CO2 from ship exhaust by NaOH solution and improves the absorption rate by adding CaO solid particles. The effect mechanism of CaO solid particles on CO2 absorption efficiency is analyzed in detail, and the mathematical model is deduced and the CaO enhancement factor is calculated through experiments. Experiment result demonstrates that the effect of CaO solid particles on the absorption of CO2 in alkali solution is significant. The absorption rate of pure CO2 gas, the simulated ship exhaust gas and 6135AZG marine diesel engine emission can be increased by 10%, 15.85% and 10.30%, respectively. So it can be seen that CaO solid particles play an important role in improving the absorption efficiency of ship CO2 emission.

TI  - Dynamic Impedances of Offshore Rock-Socketed Monopiles
AB  - With the development of offshore wind energy in China, more and more offshore wind turbines are being constructed in rock-based sea areas. However, the large diameter and thin-walled steel rock-socketed monopiles are very scarce at present, and both the construction and design are very difficult. For the design, the dynamic safety during the whole lifetime of the wind turbine is difficult to guarantee. Dynamic safety of a turbine is mostly controlled by the dynamic impedances of the rock-socketed monopile, which are still not well understood. How to choose the appropriate impedances of the socketed monopiles so that the wind turbines will neither resonant nor be too conservative is the main problem. Based on a numerical model in this study, the accurate impedances are obtained for different frequencies of excitation, different soil and rock parameters, and different rock-socketed lengths. The dynamic stiffness of monopile increases, while the radiative damping decreases as rock-socketed depth increases. When the weathering degree of rock increases, the dynamic stiffness of the monopile decreases, while the radiative damping increases.

TI  - Review on the role of terrestrial aquatic photosynthesis in the global carbon cycle
AB  - Approximately 50\% of the photosynthesis on Earth each year occurs in aquatic environments. Therefore, aquatic carbon fixation is particularly relevant in the regulation of the global climate. However, previous work concentrated mainly on the role of ocean aquatic photosynthesis in the uptake of CO2 and/or HCO3-. Here, it is shown that the role of terrestrial aquatic photosynthesis in the CO2 uptake, which utilizes dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) by rock weathering to form the autochthonous organic carbon, and thus decreases the CO2 release to atmosphere from terrestrial aquatic systems, should not be neglected in global budgeting in the carbon cycle. The magnitude of this carbon sink may account for a few hundred million tons of carbon per year, and might increase with the rise in DIC caused by global warming and anthropogenic activities. The finding that terrestrial aquatic photosynthesis results in the storage of significant amounts of DIC (CO2) has broad implications. It indicates that the rock weathering-related carbon sink is largely underestimated if only the DIC concentrations at river mouths are considered, and transformation of DIC to autochthonous TOC is neglected. It also indicates that the atmospheric CO2 sink due to carbonate weathering might be significant in also controlling long-term climate changes, due to the substantial production and burial of autochthonous organic carbon. This challenges the traditional point of view that only the chemical weathering of Ca-silicate rocks might potentially control long-term climate change. (C) 2013 The Authors.

TI  - CO2 recovery from flue gas by an ecotechnological (environmentally friendly) system
AB  - A new wet system to treat carbon dioxide in hue gas using water as an absorbent and soil as a cation-exchanger is proposed. The system consists of the following four processes. (i) Dissolution occurs of CO2 from the flue gas into soil-containing water and is accompanied by formation of carbonate ions and an increase in the pH of the solution. Soil functions as a cation-exchanger because it is rich in alkaline-earth-metal ions. (ii) The CO2 increase results in enhancement of hyrogen-ion and alkaline-earth-metal ion exchanges. (iii) Separation of the soil and aeration of the solution takes place. (iv) Carbonate-ion and alkaline-earth-metal ion reactions form carbonate salts, which are insoluble in water. The remaining solution is not toxic and does not damage the environment. It can be reused in the system or released into a river or the ocean. Our wet system is expected to be applied in developing countries because (a) inexpensive soil can be used as the cation-exchanger, (b) the discharged solution is harmless to nature and (c) insoluble carbonates may be used commercially.

TI  - Development of soybeans starch based tough, water resistant and mildew-proof adhesives through multiple cross linking cooperation strategy
AB  - The exploitation of the environment-friendly and renewable biomass adhesive is a promising alternative compared to petroleum-based ones in the wood industry. In this study, soybean flour (SF) was chosen as a renewable starting material for the preparation of the biomass adhesive. The soy protein structure was unfolded by the calcium hydroxide and multiple reactive groups (-COOH, -NH2, -OH, -SH) of the protein chain were exposed. Inspired by the marine mussel protein, tannic acid (TA) with many poly-catechol/pyrogallol groups was capable of interacting with protein molecules under the alkaline conditions and the strong metal coordination between Ca2+ and TA enable to reinforce the network structure of adhesive. Furthermore, the incorporation of 1,6-Hexanediol diglycidyl ether (HDE) into the pristine protein adhesive had reacted with protein molecules via chemical covalent bonds to form the stable and toughness cross-linking network. The as-obtained adhesive showed improved bonding strength and comparable water resistance. Notably, the enhanced adhesive showed an outstanding wet shear strength of 1.12 MPa, meeting China's interior furnishing requirements (>= 0.7 MPa). Additionally, in contrast to unmodified adhesive, the mildew resistance of the cooperation modified adhesive was improved and the storage life extended. This research provides a novel and green way to develop a formaldehyde-free adhesive for the wood industry.

TI  - Investigating the effect of nickel concentration on phytoplankton growth to assess potential side-effects of ocean alkalinity enhancement
AB  - Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) is a proposed method for removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere by the accelerated weathering of (ultra-)basic minerals to increase alkalinity - the chemical capacity of seawater to store CO2. During the weathering of OAE-relevant minerals relatively large amounts of trace metals will be released and may perturb pelagic ecosystems. Nickel (Ni) is of particular concern as it is abundant in olivine, one of the most widely considered minerals for OAE. However, so far there is limited knowledge about the impact of Ni on marine biota including phytoplankton. To fill this knowledge gap, this study tested the growth and photo-physiological response of 11 marine phytoplankton species to a wide range of dissolved Ni concentrations (from 0.07 to 50 000 nmol L-1). We found that the phytoplankton species were not very sensitive to Ni concentrations under the culturing conditions established in our experiments, but the responses were species-specific. The growth rates of 6 of the 11 tested species showed generally limited but still significant responses to changing Ni concentrations (36 \% maximum change). Photosynthetic performance, assessed by measuring the maximum quantum yield (F-v /F-m) and the functional absorption cross-section (sigma(PSII)) of photosystem II (PSII), was sensitive to changing Ni in 3 out of 11 species (35 \% maximum change) and 4 out of 11 species (16 \% maximum change), respectively. The limited effect of Ni may be partly due to the provision of nitrate as the nitrogen source for growth as previous studies suggest higher sensitivities when urea is the nitrogen source. Furthermore, the limited influence may be due to the relatively high concentrations of synthetic organic ligands added to the growth media in our experiments. These ligands are commonly added to control trace metal bioavailability and therefore for example ``free Ni2+{''} concentrations by binding the majority of the dissolved Ni. Our data suggest that dissolved Ni does not have a strong effect on phytoplankton under our experimental conditions, but we emphasize that a deeper understanding of nitrogen sources, ligand concentrations, and phytoplankton composition is needed when assessing the influence of Ni release associated with OAE.

TI  - Emissions from corrosion protection systems of offshore wind farms: Evaluation of the potential impact on the marine environment
AB  - Offshore wind energy is a fast growing sector of renewable energies worldwide. This will change the marine environment and thus, a wide range of environmental impacts of offshore wind farms are subject of current research. Here we present an overview about chemical emissions from corrosion protection systems, discuss their relevance and potential impact to the marine environment, and suggest strategies to reduce their emissions. Corrosion is a general problem for offshore infrastructures and corrosion protection systems are necessary to maintain the structural integrity. These systems are often in direct contact with seawater and have different potentials for emissions, e.g. galvanic anodes emitting substantial amounts of metals. Organic coatings may release organic substances due to weathering and/or leaching. Current assumptions suggesting a low environmental impact, but monitoring data is not sufficient to assess the environmental impact of this new source. Â© 2018

TI  - Comparative Assessment of Climate Engineering Scenarios in the Presence of Parametric Uncertainty
AB  - Climate engineering (CE) measures are increasingly discussed when dealing with the adverse impacts of climate change. While much research has focused on individual methods, few studies attempt to compare and rank the effectiveness of these measures. Furthermore, model uncertainties are seldom acknowledged and lesser still, estimated when CE scenarios are assessed. In this work, we quantify the variance in outcomes due to poorly constrained model parameters under several idealized CE scenarios. The four scenarios considered are (1) warming under the high emission scenario Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 without CE applied and the same emission scenario with (2) afforestation, (3) solar radiation management, and (4) artificial ocean alkalinization. By considering the parametric uncertainty in model outputs, we demonstrate the problems with comparing these scenarios using a single parameter setting. Using statistical emulation, we estimate the probability distributions of several model outcomes. Based on such distributions, we suggest an approach to ranking the effectiveness of the scenarios considered according to their probability of avoiding climate thresholds.

TI  - Coastal spreading of olivine to control atmospheric CO2 concentrations: A critical analysis of viability
AB  - Qualitative proposals to control atmospheric CO2 concentrations by spreading crushed olivine rock along the Earth's coastlines, thereby accelerating weathering reactions, are presently attracting considerable attention. This paper provides a critical evaluation of the concept, demonstrating quantitatively whether or not it can contribute significantly to CO2 sequestration. The feasibility of the concept depends on the rate of olivine dissolution, the sequestration capacity of the dominant reaction, and its CO2 footprint. Kinetics calculations show that offsetting 30\% of worldwide 1990 CO2 emissions by beach weathering means distributing of 5.0 Gt of olivine per year. For mean seawater temperatures of 15-25 degrees C, olivine sand (300 mu m grain size) takes 700-2100 years to reach the necessary steady state sequestration rate and is therefore of little practical value. To obtain useful, steady state CO2 uptake rates within 15-20 years requires grain sizes <10 mu m. However, the preparation and movement of the required material poses major economic, infrastructural and public health questions. We conclude that coastal spreading of olivine is not a viable method of CO2 sequestration on the scale needed. The method certainly cannot replace CCS technologies as a means of controlling atmospheric CO2 concentrations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Fate and transport of coastal driftwood: A critical review
AB  - Driftwood originating from natural and anthropogenic sources is abundant in coastal regions and plays an important role in ecosystems, providing habitat, structure, nutrients, and carbon storage. Conversely, large accumulations of driftwood can litter coastal zones, negatively impact coastal ecosystems and pose hazards to navigation, infrastructure and communities. Knowledge of the processes underlying the fate and transport of coastal driftwood is therefore needed to inform sustainable management practices. The present state of understanding is limited, and predominantly founded on studies of rivers and tsunamis, where the spatio-temporal scales and driving processes are significantly different from typical climatic or storm conditions in coastal waters. The authors critically review research on fate and transport of driftwood in coastal waters, and identify research needs and opportunities. Key knowledge gaps relate to: interactions between driftwood, littoral zone hydrodynamics and geomorphology; mechanisms of driftwood rafting and accumulation; and influence of weathering and degradation on mobility.

TI  - CO2 FIXATION BY ARTIFICIAL WEATHERING OF WASTE CONCRETE AND COCCOLITHOPHORID ALGAE CULTURES
AB  - For removal of industrially produced CO2, we have proposed a new CO2 fixation method which is combined with artificial weathering of waste concrete and coccolithophorid algae cultures. Waste concrete was suspended in sea water and weathered efficiently by supplying CO2 to the suspension. During this weathering process, CO2 was absorbed and dissolved into sea water. The maximum CO2 absorption by the concrete suspension (100 g/l) was obtained as 1.5 (g CO2)/l for 1 hr. Calcium contained in waste concrete was also dissolved in sea water. Coccolithophorid alga Emiliania huxleyi was cultured in a medium which was composed of the resulting sea water and contained sufficient dissolved inorganic carbon. Coccolith production and growth using this medium were enhanced to a greater extent than using Eppley's medium. During E. hunleyi culture, atmospheric CO2 was absorbed, and dissolved inorganic carbon was fixed in CaCO3 particles. These results demonstrate that atmospheric CO2 can be absorbed and fixed permanently in the form of calcium carbonate and biomass by artificial weathering of waste concrete and coccolithophorid alga culture.

TI  - Warming and CO2 enhance arctic heterotrophic microbial activity
AB  - Ocean acidification and warming are two main consequences of climate change that can directly affect biological and ecosystem processes in marine habitats. The Arctic Ocean is the region of the world experiencing climate change at the steepest rate compared with other latitudes. Since marine planktonic microorganisms play a key role in the biogeochemical cycles in the ocean it is crucial to simultaneously evaluate the effect of warming and increasing CO2 on marine microbial communities. In 20 L experimental microcosms filled with water from a high-Arctic fjord (Svalbard), we examined changes in phototrophic and heterotrophic microbial abundances and processes [bacterial production (BP) and mortality], and viral activity (lytic and lysogenic) in relation to warming and elevated CO2. The summer microbial plankton community living at 1.4Â°C in situ temperature, was exposed to increased CO2 concentrations (135-2,318 Î¼atm) in three controlled temperature treatments (1, 6, and 10Â°C) at the UNIS installations in Longyearbyen (Svalbard), in summer 2010. Results showed that chlorophyll a concentration decreased at increasing temperatures, while BP significantly increased with pCO2 at 6 and 10Â°C. Lytic viral production was not affected by changes in pCO2 and temperature, while lysogeny increased significantly at increasing levels of pCO2, especially at 10Â°C (R2 = 0.858, p = 0.02). Moreover, protistan grazing rates showed a positive interaction between pCO2 and temperature. The averaged percentage of bacteria grazed per day was higher (19.56 Â± 2.77% d-1) than the averaged percentage of lysed bacteria by virus (7.18 Â± 1.50% d-1) for all treatments. Furthermore, the relationship among microbial abundances and processes showed that BP was significantly related to phototrophic pico/nanoflagellate abundance in the 1Â°C and the 6Â°C treatments, and BP triggered viral activity, mainly lysogeny at 6 and 10Â°C, while bacterial mortality rates was significantly related to bacterial abundances at 6Â°C. Consequently, our experimental results suggested that future increases in water temperature and pCO2 in Arctic waters will produce a decrease of phytoplankton biomass, enhancement of BP and changes in the carbon fluxes within the microbial food web. All these heterotrophic processes will contribute to weakening the CO2 sink capacity of the Arctic plankton community.

TI  - Temperature and CO2 dependency of global carbonate weathering fluxes â€“ Implications for future carbonate weathering research
AB  - Carbonate weathering and transfer of carbon towards the coastal zone is one of the relevant sinks for atmospheric CO2, controlled by hydrology, ecosystem respiration, river water degassing, and further factors. Specifically, the connection between the soil-rock system to the river systems and instream processes affecting the weathering product fluxes remain under-researched. Based on constraints for soil-rock PCO2, river PCO2, and an identified dependence of river alkalinity on temperature, this work tested which controls should be considered at the global scale to accomplish a more holistic carbonate rock weathering model. Compiled river data suggests that with increasing land temperature, above approximately 11 Â°C, the amount of instream alkalinity in carbonate catchments decreases due to the temperature effect on the carbonate system, while the converse holds true at lower temperatures. Latter is in accordance with calcite dissolution controlled by soil-rock PCO2 estimates based on ecosystem respiration. In addition, the type of the weathering system (open, semi-closed to closed system with respect to CO2) was identified to be highly relevant for global weathering estimations. Open systems seem to be the most dominant boundary condition of calcite weathering in the soil profile. Tropical areas with thick soil layers, however, cause the carbonate weathering system to shift from open to semi-closed or closed system conditions. The findings support that calcite weathering fluxes in the soil profile are higher than the fluxes to the ocean transported by rivers. Furthermore, an increase in mean land temperature does not necessarily translate into an increase of lateral weathering fluxes because it might have an influence on soil development, discharge, CO2 degassing, soil respiration and calcite dissolution. All these named factors need to be addressed to be able to quantify global carbonate weathering fluxes and to assess the sensitivity of carbonate weathering fluxes on climate variability. Future works should focus on collecting more temporal river chemistry data, mainly in tropical regions, to understand the main mechanism causing the observed decrease of alkalinity concentration with temperature.

TI  - Enhanced weathering strategies for stabilizing climate and averting ocean acidification
AB  - Chemical breakdown of rocks, weathering, is an important but very slow part of the carbon cycle that ultimately leads to CO2 being locked up in carbonates on the ocean floor. Artificial acceleration of this carbon sink via distribution of pulverized silicate rocks across terrestrial landscapesmay help offset anthropogenic CO2 emissions(1-5). We show that idealized enhanced weathering scenarios over less than a third of tropical land could cause significant drawdown of atmospheric CO2 and ameliorate ocean acidification by 2100. Global carbon cycle modelling(6-8) driven by ensemble Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) projections of twenty-first-century climate change (RCP8.5, business-as-usual; RCP4.5, medium-level mitigation)(9,10) indicates that enhanced weathering could lower atmospheric CO2 by 30-300 ppm by 2100, depending mainly on silicate rock application rate (1 kg or 5 kg m(-2) yr(-1)) and composition. At the higher application rate, end-of-century ocean acidification is reversed under RCP4.5 and reduced by about two-thirds under RCP8.5. Additionally, surface ocean aragonite saturation state, a key control on coral calcification rates, is maintained above 3.5 throughout the low latitudes, thereby helping maintain the viability of tropical coral reef ecosystems(11-14). However, we highlight major issues of cost, social acceptability, and potential unanticipated consequences that will limit utilization and emphasize the need for urgent efforts to phase down fossil fuel emissions(15).

TI  - Catchment liming creates recolonization opportunity for sensitive invertebrates in a smelter impacted landscape
AB  - The response of a sensitive indicator species to the effects of catchment liming was assessed in a lake severely impacted by atmospheric emissions from a metal smelter in Sudbury, Canada. The lake chemistry recovered following the closure of the local smelter and major reductions (approximately 95\%) in acid and metal emissions from other area smelters, leading to recolonization of the lake with fish and other biota. However, the littoral macrobenthos community remain severely impoverished. The catchment liming sustained improved stream water quality for 20 years after the initial aerial treatment and created a littoral zone hot spot for the recolonization of Hyalella azteca. Colonization at delta sites of untreated catchment drainage areas, in the same lake, were low and highly variable, and these sites appeared to be impacted from soil erosion and episodic release of acid and metals. This study demonstrated the need to both reduce air pollutants and to conduct land reclamation in severely damaged watersheds, before lake ecosystems themselves can be fully recovered.
