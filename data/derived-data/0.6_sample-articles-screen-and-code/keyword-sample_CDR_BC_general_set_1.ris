TI  - A validated and accurate method for quantifying and extrapolating mangrove aboveâ€ground biomass using lidar data
AB  - LiDAR data and derived canopy height models can provide useful information about mangrove tree heights that assist with quantifying mangrove aboveâ€ground biomass. This study presents a validated method for quantifying mangrove heights using LiDAR data and calibrating this against plotâ€based estimates of aboveâ€ground biomass. This approach was initially validated for the mangroves of Darwin Harbour, in Northern Australia, which are structurally complex and have high species diversity. Established relationships were then extrapolated to the nearby West Alligator River, which provided the opportunity to quantify biomass at a remote location where intensive fieldwork was limited. Relationships between LiDARâ€derived mangrove heights and mean tree height per plot were highly robust for Ceriops tagal, Rhizophora stylosa and Sonneratia alba (r2 = 0.84â€“0.94, RMSE = 0.03â€“ 0.91 m; RMSE% = 0.07%â€“11.27%), and validated well against an independent dataset. Additionally, relationships between the derived canopy height model and fieldâ€based estimates of aboveâ€ground biomass were also robust and validated (r2 = 0.73â€“0.90, RMSE = 141.4 kgâ€“1098.58 kg, RMSE% of 22.94â€“ 39.31%). Speciesâ€specific estimates of tree density per plot were applied in order to align biomass of individual trees with the resolution of the canopy height model. The total aboveâ€ground biomass at Darwin Harbour was estimated at 120 t haâˆ’1 and comparisons with prior estimates of mangrove above-ground biomass confirmed the accuracy of this assessment. To establish whether accurate and validated relationships could be extrapolated elsewhere, the established relationships were applied to a LiDARâ€derived canopy height model at nearby West Alligator River. Aboveâ€ground biomass derived from extrapolated relationships was estimated at 206 t haâˆ’1, which compared well with prior biomass estimates, confirming that this approach can be extrapolated to remote locations, providing the mangrove forests are biogeographically similar. The validated method presented in this study can be used for reporting mangrove carbon storage under national obligations, and is useful for quantifying carbon within various markets.

TI  - Forest fuel reduction alters fire severity and long-term carbon storage in three Pacific Northwest ecosystems
AB  - Two forest management objectives being debated in the context of federally managed landscapes in the U.S. Pacific Northwest involve a perceived trade-off between fire restoration and carbon sequestration. The former strategy would reduce fuel (and therefore C) that has accumulated through a century of fire suppression and exclusion which has led to extreme fire risk in some areas. The latter strategy would manage forests for enhanced C sequestration as a method of reducing atmospheric CO2 and associated threats from global climate change. We explored the trade-off between these two strategies by employing a forest ecosystem simulation model, STANDCARB, to examine the effects of fuel reduction on fire severity and the resulting long-term C dynamics among three Pacific Northwest ecosystems: the east Cascades ponderosa pine forests, the west Cascades western hemlock-Douglas-fir forests, and the Coast Range western hemlock-Sitka spruce forests. Our simulations indicate that fuel reduction treatments in these ecosystems consistently reduced fire severity. However, reducing the fraction by which C is lost in a wildfire requires the removal of a much greater amount of C, since most of the C stored in forest biomass (stem wood, branches, coarse woody debris) remains unconsumed even by high-severity wildfires. For this reason, all of the fuel reduction treatments simulated for the west Cascades and Coast Range ecosystems as well as most of the treatments simulated for the east Cascades resulted in a reduced mean stand C storage. One suggested method of compensating for such losses in C storage is to utilize C harvested in fuel reduction treatments as biofuels. Our analysis indicates that this will not be an effective strategy in the west Cascades and Coast Range over the next 100 years. We suggest that forest management plans aimed solely at ameliorating increases in atmospheric CO2 should forgo fuel reduction treatments in these ecosystems, with the possible exception of some east Cascades ponderosa pine stands with uncharacteristic levels of understory fuel accumulation. Balancing a demand for maximal landscape C storage with the demand for reduced wildfire severity will likely require treatments to be applied strategically throughout the landscape rather than indiscriminately treating all stands.

TI  - Large-scale release and dispersion of CO2: Experiments and simulation
AB  - Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) has emerged as a viable technique to mitigate climate change, reduce greenhouse gases and ocean acidification, and to enhance oil or gas recovery. An important part of the CCS chain is pipeline transport of dense-phase carbon dioxide (CO2) from large point sources to suitable storage sites. Since CO2 is an asphyxiating gas, deliberate or accidental leaks from pipelines represent a serious hazard, and realistic consequence modelling of such scenarios is of paramount importance for safety. This paper presents results from numerical simulations of an industrial-scale pipeline release and the subsequent dispersion of CO2 in the atmosphere. The experiment and flow model development was part of the CO2PipeHaz project in the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7). The length and internal diameter of the pipeline used in the experimental setup was 260 m and 0.233 m, respectively. Pure CO2 was discharged through a 0.05 m diameter orifice located 0.5 m above ground at the end section of the pipeline. The initial temperature was 20 Â°C and the initial pressure 53 bar. The measurements included wind speed, wind direction and temperature of the CO2 plume. Comparison between experimental results and numerical simulations with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software FLACS shows good agreement. The numerical study provides useful insight into the dispersion behaviour of the CO2 plume, and highlights the sensitivity towards the use of various turbulence models, surface roughness and wind conditions. The paper represents a significant contribution to the understanding of hazards associated with pipeline transport of carbon dioxide.

TI  - Co-optimization of CO2 EOR and sequestration process in a north sea chalk reservoir
AB  - Traditional EOR approaches intend to minimize the injected CO2 to reduce the high cost of the purchased gas, while this approach does not satisfy the sequestration objective to maximize the CO2 stored in the reservoir by the end of the flooding period. In this paper, a new approach is presented where, a methodology is developed to optimize both EOR and sequestration processes. CO2 injection into a North Sea chalk field is studied using a compositional reservoir simulator. We have investigated the effect of six parameters including injection scheme, injector and producer well type, well control mode, slug size and the WAG ratio on the coupled CO 2 EOR and sequestration process. Three different injection strategies using either pure CO2 or a mixture of CO2 and hydrocarbon gas including WAG, continuous CO2 injection and soak alternating CO2 injection have been investigated. Three well configurations are considered. It includes a vertical and two horizontal well options completed in the third and fifth layer of the reservoir. We have considered BHP and rate control as effective well control modes. Experimental design is used to perform an efficient sensitivity analysis on the mentioned parameters. Two objective functions have been defined, aimed at co-optimization of EOR and sequestration processes while respecting the economy of the process through minimizing recycled CO2. In this work a methodology / approach has been developed, which could be applied to other fields. In the case studied here, the results show that the water alternating gas injection scheme using a mixture of CO2 and hydrocarbon gas to be the optimum case (EOR and sequestration process).

TI  - Critical space scales for aggregation-mediated carbon export from ocean fertilization
AB  - Several experiments have attempted to test Martin's hypothesis that addition of soluble iron to iron-limited ocean regions will lead to an increase in carbon sequestration via phytoplankton growth and sedimentation. However, artificially iron-induced blooms do not always trigger increases in vertical carbon export. Here we show that to trigger export, a patch must be larger than a threshold size. Phytoplankton sink en masse only after reaching a critical concentration for aggregation, and concentration is dependent on the competitive balance between growth and horizontal turbulent diffusion, which in turn varies with patch length scale. We summarize this balance using a non-dimensional parameter, Q, and use a simple 2D model solving a growth-diffusion-export equation to show that export flux occurs from a fertilized patch when Q < 1, and that flux is maximized at a value of Q below this critical point. A simple nutrient limitation model generates predictions of particle export from patch fertilization experiments.

TI  - Prioritizing land-management options for carbon sequestration potential
AB  - Global warming is inevitable. Therefore, the need is to develop strategies to reduce the greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Carbon sequestration through biomass seems to be a cheap and viable option. There are several land-use options which can sequester carbon. Their potential of locking carbon differs not only with the type of species, but also with the agroclimatic zones. Hence, location-specific land-use systems need to be prioritized taking both carbon sequestration potential and socio-economic needs into account. It was found that in the terai zone of West Bengal, fallow land and agricultural field sequester 5.86\% and 4.73\% carbon respectively, compared to the natural forest of Shorea robusta. However, agroforestry systems, viz. tea garden and agrihorticulture contributed 24.24\% and 9.09\% carbon respectively. The agrihorticulture system while sequestering carbon also provides agricultural. crops and other economic gains, including carbon credits, and hence seems to be the best option. The potential of carbon storage of tree + crop-based system can be further increased using improved planting materials of perennial components.

TI  - Distribution of organic carbon in tropical mangrove sediments (Cochin, India)
AB  - Surficial sediments were sampled every month from three mangrove regions around the metropolis of Cochin (India). Sedimentary organic carbon content exhibited wide seasonal fluctuations. The hydrology of the mangrove system is regulated mainly by high rainfall during the monsoon and by tidal inundation. The results indicated the role of tidal activity and sediment texture in the preservation and retention of organic matter. Â© 2006 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Evaluating the energy consumption and air emissions of CO2-enhanced oil recovery in China: A partial life cycle assessment of extralow permeability reservoirs
AB  - Carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) can capture, transport and store CO2 emitted by high energy consumption enterprises. Therefore, the use of CO2-EOR enhances oil recovery and is also an effective means of reducing CO2 emissions. Currently, energy and environmental assessments of CO2-EOR have been rare in China. In this study, partial life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to evaluate the energy consumption and air emissions gate to grave in a CO2-EOR test station for extralow permeability reservoirs in northern China. The gate to gate of CO2-EOR defines 5 stages: transportation, liquefaction, injection, oil production and recycling. Through the analysis of these stages, the results show that producing one metric ton of crude oil gate to gate consumes 2472.56 kW hours of electricity and emits 2532.63 kilograms of CO2, 74.18 kg of SO2 and 37.38 kg of NOx. Water flooding that occurs under similar geological conditions is selected and compared with CO2-EOR for energy consumption and air emissions. In the case of producing one metric ton of crude oil, CO2-EOR gate to gate consumes more electricity than water flooding gate to gate and emits more CO2, SO2 and NOx. Compared with the amount of CO2 injection, the net CO2 emissions of CO2-EOR gate to gate to produce one metric ton of crude oil are -1675.15 kg, and the net CO2 emissions of water flooding gate to gate to produce one metric ton of crude oil are 775.83 kg. When considering energy consumption in the downstream segments of CO2-EOR, the net CO2 emissions of CO2-EOR gate to grave to produce one metric ton of crude oil are 0.53 metric tons. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the policy implications and sustainable development of CO2-EOR in China. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Comparison of Waves Reduction by Mangrove Avicennia Marina in East Lampung and Indah Kapuk Beach, Indonesia
AB  - Mangrove Avicennia Marina has important role in wave reduction. The purpose of this research were: (1) To know wave energy ratio in Indah Kapuk Beach and East Lampung Regency, Indonesia. (2) To know the influence of Avicennia Marina mangrove's respiratory roots on wave energy reduction. Measurement of wave in Indah Kapuk Beach used SBE26, in East Lampung used SBE26 and RBRDUO TD. Parameters were the structure of mangrove vegetation and wave energy reduction. The wave observed in Indah Kapuk Beach tends to be smaller than in East Lampung, so the influence of respiratory root in reducing wave in Indah Kapuk Beach was less visible while the influence of respiratory root in East Lampung was more clearly seen. The muffled wave in the Indah Kapuk Beach research was less visible due to the presence of inhibitors obstructing the incoming waves, while the reduced wave was more clearly measured in the study in East Lampung because without an inhibitors of wave coming.

TI  - Towards a deterministic approach to calcite scaling in the porous media during CO2 sequestration and immiscible CO2 flooding
AB  - Scale deposition has been known to occur in porous media when the existing fluid becomes supersaturated based on changes in the ambient pressures and temperatures. Studies have been performed on the generation of mathematical models for evaluating scales in radial flow. Scaling is a well-known problem in producing wells, and prediction models from thermodynamic and kinetic aspects have been provided, and methods have been addressed in the industry to solve this problem. In this study, calcite deposition in the reservoir during CO2 injection processes is evaluated deterministically. Limited studies have been performed on calcite scaling in porous media with a reservoir simulation tool. CO2 EOR and sequestration has been widely analyzed. However, the mineralization factor has only been looked at from a CO2 storage point of view. Some light on the possible effects of calcite precipitation has on oil production. Calcite scaling tends to reduce the cross-sectional flow area for fluids in the pores, thus resulting in a permeability reduction which hampers levels of oil production. In order to quantify scale deposition in porous media, four different simulation cases were studied: 1. CO2 storage in an aquifer model, 2.CO2 EOR in a Light-Oil reservoir model, 3.CO2 storage in an aquifer-like lab-scale core model along with sensitivities. For the field-scale aquifer case, the effect of temperature, salinity, and heterogeneity on calcite deposition in the aquifer. CO2-EOR along with miscible and immiscible CO2 flooding were studied, to visualize the presence of calcite precipitation and its impact on oil recovery. Â© 2019, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - Solution and Diffusion Process of Carbon Dioxide in Seawater
AB  - Solution and diffusion process of carbon dioxide (CO2) in seawater is important in the research and development of CO2 ocean sequestration technology to mitigate global warming. In the present study, solution processes of CO2 gas in seawater and synthetic seawater were experimentally and theoretically studied under various pressures and temperatures to evaluate the transport process of CO2 in seawater. It was obtained that the solubilities of CO2 increase with an increase in pressure, but decrease with an increase in temperature. The solubility of CO2 in synthetic seawater decreases with an increase in salt concentration. An empirical correlation for solubility of CO(2 i)n seawater at various temperatures and pressures was obtained based on the experimental data. It can express the experimental data within +/- 6\%, and express the data by Stewart and Munjal within +/- 15\%. In the theoretical analysis for the solution of single CO2 bubble in seawater, it was concluded that the rate of solution of bubble in liquid is affected strongly by various parameters, such as solubility, diffusion coefficient, bubble radius, and temperature. The bubble solution process is enhanced by lowering the temperature: the total solution time at 280 K is 20\% shorter than that at 293 K under the pressure of 4 MPa.

TI  - Potential for invasive mammalian herbivore control to result in measurable carbon gains
AB  - Invasive mammalian herbivores (e.g. deer, feral goats and brushtail possums; hereafter `herbivores') are widespread throughout New Zealand and their control is important for conservation. In addition to known biodiversity benefits, it has recently been suggested that herbivore control could lead to measureable carbon gains when aggregated across a large area of conservation land. However, a significant amount of uncertainty exists regarding the potential effects of herbivore control on carbon, and the practicalities of successfully implementing such projects. This paper provides a general basis for managers and ecologists to design scientifically robust herbivore control projects for carbon gain in New Zealand. Although there are few direct data on changes in carbon sequestration rates following herbivore control, the data that are available suggest that effect sizes are likely to be small in magnitude, variable in direction, and to occur primarily though complex indirect mechanisms. The largest positive effects of herbivore control (carbon sequestration rate of 1-2 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) are likely to occur in localised areas of highly palatable early-successional vegetation and high herbivore densities where control initiates rapid development of woody vegetation. Project location is therefore critical in determining the potential for carbon gain in herbivore control projects. A power analysis reveals that the ability to monitor changes in carbon stock using plot-based methods is limited to effect sizes of > 0.5 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1), as smaller effect sizes would require an impractically large number of plots (i.e. >100), and the financial and carbon costs of implementing the control and quantifying the effects are likely to outweigh any potential carbon gains. Although more research is urgently required to quantify potential gains, and the mechanisms that underlie them, our findings suggest that with careful site selection, implementation, and monitoring, control of invasive mammalian herbivores could sometimes provide carbon gains in certain areas of New Zealand's indigenous vegetation.

TI  - The geological CO2 storage capacity of the Jeju Basin, offshore southern Korea, estimated using the storage efficiency
AB  - We estimated the storage capacity for geological CO2 sequestration of the Jeju Basin off southern Korea, northern East China Sea using the storage efficiency and a deterministic, volumetric method. We analyzed seismic and well-log data to get the geological parameters and used the storage efficiency parameters for deep saline, nonmarine sediments in open systems. The time interval of the basin fill from 1.2 to 2.8s two-way traveltime was selected for the depth zone for CO2 storage. This interval corresponds to the depth range of about 1200m to about 3900m and occurs mostly below the Late-Miocene unconformity which largely separates the thin nonmarine to shallow-marine sediments above and the thicker nonmarine sediments below. The time interval was divided into eight layers of equal time thickness of 0.2s two-way traveltime to determine the representative porosity and the in situ pressure, temperature, and density of CO2 for different depth ranges. The estimated geological CO2 storage capacities for the rock volume in the eight-layer interval range from about 23.5Ã—1012kg (23.5Gt) to about 687.0Ã—1012kg (687Gt) with an average of about 196.0Ã—1012kg (196.0Gt).

TI  - A study on bubble plume behavior in stratified water
AB  - Plumes of air and carbon-dioxide (CO2) bubbles in stratified water were studied experimentally and numerically. It is important to understand the plume behavior of droplets or bubbles in the ocean in marine environmental engineering. In sequestration of CO2 in the ocean, liquid CO2 is injected in the form of droplets, and thermal stratification in enclosed seas is possibly destroyed by a bubble generator. This study focuses on the relationship between intrusion depth and stratification intensity, gas flow rate, and bubble size. A desktop-sized tank was used to achieve no-background-flow conditions for salt stratification. The results from the air-bubble experiments indicated that the larger the bubble size, the smaller the intrusion depth. We also observed the behavior of CO2 bubbles. They are different from air in that they dissolve in water and are reduced in volume. Our numerical simulation method for two-phase flow was validated by comparisons with the experiments.

TI  - 3D CSEM modeling and time-lapse sensitivity analysis for subsurface CO2 storage
AB  - Monitoring a time-lapse geophysical anomaly due to variation in the pore-fluid contents of a subsurface reservoir is critical for further development and management. However, it may be difficult to detect the changes in P-wave responses beyond a certain level of saturation. A comprehensive 3D finite-difference time domain (FDTD) forward modeling, based on idealized subsurface resistivity structures, demonstrates the possibility of marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) surveying to monitor the movement of subsurface CO2 storage. We focused on CSEM sensitivity studies with respect to variations in geometry and/or saturation of CO2 storage, evaluation of the effects of reservoir depths and lithology, and detection of CO2 leakage from the main storage. A 100% lateral expansion from the initial diameter (1500 m) of a typical CO2 plume with thickness and resistivity of 100 m and 80 m, respectively, at 850 m below seafloor, results in 41% electric field (E-field) magnitude increase at 2500 m source-receiver offset for 0.5 Hz source frequency. In comparison, a 300% vertical expansion of a 50 m thick plume with diameter and resistivity of 2500 m and 80 m, respectively, gives only a 7% E-field magnitude anomaly. An increase of the aspect ratio of a CO2 plume with diameter and thickness of 1750 and 130 m, respectively, by 110%, without volumetric change, results in a 20% E-field magnitude increase. The E-field magnitude differences due to CO2 saturation change by 20% in clay-rich (10% clay) and clean reservoirs are almost identical; thus, a time-lapse anomaly in a clay-rich reservoir might be detectable. A gradual inverse variation of offset and frequency can differentiate the responses of a 50 m thick shallow CO2 accumulation, 200 m below the seafloor, from the main CO2 plume at 850 m below the seafloor and allow for early warning of CO2 leakage.

TI  - 3D geomechanical modeling for CO2 geological storage in faulted formations. A case study in an offshore northern Adriatic reservoir, Italy
AB  - One of the six CO2 carbon capture and storage (CCS) demonstration projects recently selected within the European Energy Programme for Recovery (EEPR) is located in Italy. In the framework of the feasibility study, the selection of a geological formation suitable to store the required 1Mt/yr of CO2 over 10 years and the safety of the CO2 disposal are two major issues. In the present modeling study, we investigate the role played by geomechanics in assessing the maximum CO2 amount that can be sequestered into a 2000m deep multi-compartment reservoir seated in the off-shore northern Adriatic sedimentary basin. We use a three-dimensional finite element-interface element geomechanical model to simulate the possible mechanical failure in both the injected formation and caprock, the fault reactivation, and the ground surface displacement. The faulted geological structure is reproduced based on detailed seismic surveys, with petrophysical/geomechanical properties based on the several well-logs available from several oil/gas explorations in the area. The pore pressure distribution due to two injection wells is provided by a fluid-dynamic simulator and a sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the role of the major uncertainties in the geomechanical setting. The modeling results suggest that a safe and permanent containment may be secured over a few years only. Afterwards, mechanical failure by shear stress is likely to be experienced by a significant portion of reservoir's injected compartments. Shear failure and fault reactivation can occur much before attaining the hydraulic fracturing pressure, hence represent two major issues in assessing the maximum allowable CO2 injection overpressure.

TI  - COBRA: A research accelerator for the crustal ocean biosphere
AB  - The deep seafloor covers two-thirds of Earthâ€™s surface area, but our understanding of the ecosystems and resources found in the deep ocean, as well as the ability of deep-sea ecosystems to withstand human perturbation, is limited. These deep-sea habitats demand urgent study as there are emergent human uses in the form of deep-sea mining and carbon sequestration that will fundamentally alter physical, chemical, and biological conditions that took millions of years to establish. We propose the international network COBRA, a research accelerator for the crustal ocean biosphere. COBRA will bring together diverse stakeholders and experts, including interdisciplinary academic and government scientists, private institutions, policy makers, data systems engineers, industry experts, and others to coordinate efforts that generate new knowledge and inform decision making about activities that could affect the deep ocean and, by extension, all of society. We will also train the next generation of leaders in ocean exploration, science, and policy through an innovative virtual program to carry this effort into future generations of ocean and earth science research. COBRA will inform policies relating to emergent industrial uses of the deep ocean, decrease the likelihood of serious harm to the environment, and maintain ecosystem services for the benefit of society.

TI  - Ocean systems for managing the global carbon cycle
AB  - Carbon dioxide is formed in all processes utilizing fossil fuels. Controlling the emissions of CO2 from a number of processes by forming CO2 hydrates (clathrates), may be an effective approach for both absorbing CO2 from multicomponent gas streams (Flue gases, Anaerobic digester gases, etc.) and sequestering CO2 in the deep oceans. Further, ocean marine farms may be an effective process for extracting CO2 from the atmosphere and forming both valuable products and rejecting excess CO2, in the form of clathrates, to the deep ocean. Preliminary engineering analyses indicates that clathrate formation for controlling both conventional fossil fuel gaseous CO2 emissions and those associated with marine farm anaerobic digester gases may provide a meaningful control strategy for CO2 .

TI  - The value of carbon sequestration and storage in coastal habitats
AB  - Coastal margin habitats are globally significant in terms of their capacity to sequester and store carbon, but their continuing decline, due to environmental change and human land use decisions, is reducing their capacity to provide this ecosystem service. In this paper the UK is used as a case study area to develop methodologies to quantify and value the ecosystem service of blue carbon sequestration and storage in coastal margin habitats. Changes in UK coastal habitat area between 1900 and 2060 are documented, the long term stocks of carbon stored by these habitats are calculated, and the capacity of these habitats to sequester CO2 is detailed. Changes in value of the carbon sequestration service of coastal habitats are then projected for 2000-2060 under two scenarios, the maintenance of the current state of the habitat and the continuation of current trends of habitat loss. If coastal habitats are maintained at their current extent, their sequestration capacity over the period 2000-2060 is valued to be in the region of 1 pound billion UK sterling (3.5\% discount rate). However, if current trends of habitat loss continue, the capacity of the coastal habitats both to sequester and store CO2 will be significantly reduced, with a reduction in value of around 0.25 pound billion UK sterling (2000-2060; 3.5\% discount rate). If loss-trends due to sea level rise or land reclamation worsen, this loss in value will be greater. This case study provides valuable site specific information, but also highlights global issues regarding the quantification and valuation of carbon sequestration and storage. Whilst our ability to value ecosystem services is improving, considerable uncertainty remains. If such ecosystem valuations are to be incorporated with confidence into national and global policy and legislative frameworks, it is necessary to address this uncertainty. Recommendations to achieve this are outlined. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Identification of culturable microbial functional groups isolated from the rhizosphere of four species of mangroves and their biotechnological potential
AB  - This study identified microbial functional groups like total culturable bacteria, potential N-2-fixing free living bacteria, N-2-fixing hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria, N-assimilating hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria, total fungi, actinobacteria, P-solubilizers, lipolytic microorganisms, and starch, cellulose, pectin and protein degrading microorganisms, isolated from the rhizosphere of four species of mangroves (Red, Black, White, and Button) from the natural protected area at the Terminos Lagoon, Campeche, Mexico. Overall, microbial populations showed significant differences (P<0.05) among the four mangrove species. The rhizosphere of White mangrove showed better chemical and textural soil properties, and harbored the highest microbial populations when compared to the remaining mangrove species. The principal component analysis indicated that two components accounted the 85.3\% of the total variation. The most significant textural and chemical soil properties were the major components, CPI (organic matter and total organic carbon) and CP2 (sand and clay). Microbial populations correlated (P<0.05, Pearson coefficient) with sand and clay particles, and with some soil chemical properties such as organic matter. The total nitrogen and organic carbon significantly correlated with cellulose degraders, while phosphorus with N-2-fixing bacteria, total fungi, and with pectin and starch degraders.

TI  - An analysis of the potential positive and negative livelihood impacts of coastal carbon offset projects
AB  - Carbon offset credits, and associated projects, are acclaimed to address economic, environmental and social issues simultaneously. However, critics argue that carbon offset mechanisms are ill equipped to assist developing countries in achieving sustainable development. Social standards now exist to provide robust methods for assessing the social and biodiversity performance of carbon offset projects and credible impact assessments to help ensure positive outcomes for local people and biodiversity. Following such a standard, and simultaneously applying the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach, we develop the Coastal Carbon Impacts Framework (CCIF) as a conceptual framework to document the potential positive and negative impacts of coastal carbon offset projects on local livelihoods. We apply the CCIF to four case studies and derive its main livelihood outcomes as well as describe potential long-term impacts. By using the capitals approach, the CCIF is able to dismantle the different impact areas into smaller entities. This allows a more detailed analysis on the positive and negative impacts a project has on communities â€“ across the natural, financial, social, human, physical, cultural and political capital. While the case studies analysed show mainly positive outcomes, certainly no project is without risk of negatively impacting the community. The CCIF is however able to demonstrate potential social risk areas. If applied to additional coastal carbon offset projects, best practice documents, community engagement and the monitoring and evaluation process of such projects can be improved. Â© 2019

TI  - Integrating scientific knowledge, data and stakeholder perceptions for decision support
AB  - the marine food web is considered to be a factor of key importance for the global carbon balance. The concept of the 'Biological Pump' refers to the mechanism by which CO2 fixed by photosynthesis is transferred to the deep ocean through biologically-driven processes, resulting in sequestration of carbon for a period of decades or longer. Stressors affecting the efficiency of the biological pump include water column stability, sea temperature, acidity, excessive nutrients inputs, overfishing, pollution and other anthropogenic changes. The aim of the EU-FP7 project OCEAN-CERTAIN is to reduce the uncertainties in our understanding of the impacts of these stressors on the mechanisms underlying the biological pump, and the resilience of coastal and marine stakeholders for the social-economic impacts of changes in the marine food web. Modelling, field sampling and stakeholder workshops are combined for three case studies in the Arctic, the Eastern Mediterranean and Patagonia. The central paradigm of the project is 'Consilience' referring to the integration of data, information and scientific knowledge from different domains and sources to achieve an added value surpassing that of the individual elements. A close collaboration between natural and social scientists, and software engineers is inherent to the concept of consilience. The project results are used to design a Decision-Support System (DSS) integrating scientific knowledge with data and stakeholder expertise, serving as platform for policy analysis. Consilience, and more in particular systems analysis, are the basis for the DSS architecture but by themselves these cannot solve all the practical and methodological issues encountered. A challenge for the project is the integration of the findings and knowledge of the behavioral and natural sciences in the DSS. A combination of three techniques is used to address the issue: a component-based architecture, meta-modelling to represent the biophysical processes described by the components, and fuzzy cognitive mapping to represent narrative scenarios derived from local knowledge.

TI  - Global carbon dioxide removal rates from forest landscape restoration activities
AB  - Background: Forest landscape restoration (FLR) has been adopted by governments and practitioners across the globe to mitigate and adapt to climate change and restore ecological functions across degraded landscapes. However, the extent to which these activities capture CO2 with associated climate mitigation impacts are poorly known, especially in geographies where data on biomass growth of restored forests are limited or do not exist. To fill this gap, we developed biomass accumulation rates for a set of FLR activities (natural regeneration, planted forests and woodlots, agroforestry, and mangrove restoration) across the globe and global CO2 removal rates with corresponding confidence intervals, grouped by FLR activity and region/climate. Results: Planted forests and woodlots were found to have the highest CO2 removal rates, ranging from 4.5 to 40.7 t CO2 ha-1 year-1 during the first 20 years of growth. Mangrove tree restoration was the second most efficient FLR at removing CO2, with growth rates up to 23.1 t CO2 ha-1 year-1 the first 20 years post restoration. Natural regeneration removal rates were 9.1-18.8 t CO2 ha-1 year-1 during the first 20 years of forest regeneration, followed by agroforestry, the FLR category with the lowest and regionally broad removal rates (10.8-15.6 t CO2 ha-1 year-1). Biomass growth data was most abundant and widely distributed across the world for planted forests and natural regeneration, representing 45% and 32% of all the data points assessed, respectively. Agroforestry studies, were only found in Africa, Asia, and the Latin America and Caribbean regions. Conclusion: This study represents the most comprehensive review of published literature on tree growth and CO2 removals to date, which we operationalized by constructing removal rates for specific FLR activities across the globe. These rates can easily be applied by practitioners and decision-makers seeking to better understand the positive climate mitigation impacts of existing or planned FLR actions, or by countries making restoration pledges under the Bonn Challenge Commitments or fulfilling Nationally Determined Contributions to the UNFCCC, thereby helping boost FLR efforts world-wide.

TI  - Socio-environmental impacts of wind farms on the traditional communities of the western coast of Ceara, in the Brazilian Northeast
AB  - The global expansion of wind power has resulted from the development of scientific research that aims to establish an energy network which minimizes the emission of pollutants derived from the combustion of fossil fuels. Ceara, in the Brazilian Northeast, has a considerable potential for the generation of environment-friendly power, due to the occurrence of strong winds on many parts of the coast and at higher elevations. Given this, the present study aimed to evaluate the socio-environmental damage caused by the installation of a wind farm on the coastal plain of the municipality of Camocim, on the western coast of the state, and to identify the consequences for the coastal environment and the traditional community of Xavier, which survives primarily on fishing, agriculture, and the extraction of natural resources. The study was based on the recognition and definition of the environmental components of the local landscapes, and the mapping of the community's territory, based on the social cartography approach. The study area is characterized by mangrove ecosystems, dune fields, interdunal lakes, fluvial-lacustrine coastal plains, and a sandy beach. The integration of these different environments underpins the traditional lifestyle of the local community, which is based primarily on the exploitation of natural resources. Given this, the community of Xavier, which is made up of 20 families, was affected directly by the installation and subsequent operation of the local wind farm (one of the largest in the Brazilian Northeast, with 50 wind turbines generating a maximum output of 104.4 MW, and approximately 135 km of transmission lines) through (1) the gratuitous occupation of a significant portion of the community's territory, (2) deforestation of fixed dunes, (3) the suppression of dunes by bulldozing, (4) burying of interdunal lakes, (5) disturbance of the margins of fluvial-lacustrine systems, (6) compaction and impermeabilization of the soil, and (7) artificial retention of mobile dunes. These findings indicate that the licensing of wind farms in the state ignores a set of socio-environmental principles. The results of this analysis indicate the need for a regional blueprint for the development of effective socio-environmental policies for the sustainable exploitation of the coastline of the Brazilian Northeast, and in particular for the definition of the sectors most appropriate for the installation of wind farms, such as the coastal plains, which have been classified as the alternative sites with the best potential, as long as effective licensing measures are implemented.

TI  - CO2 EOR and storage in oil reservoirs
AB  - CO2 injection into tertiary oil reservoirs has been widely accepted as an effective technique for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and has been used by the oil industry for over 40 years. Concerns over greenhouse gas emissions are leading to the investigation and realisation of its potential as a carbon storage method in recent years. With the right reservoir conditions, injection of CO2 into oil reservoirs can result in incremental oil recovery and permanent storage of CO2 in geological formation. The majority of previous and current CO2 EOR projects use l ow cost CO2 sources and have good economic returns in terms of high gas utilisation efficiencies (167-227 sm3 CO2/STB oil). The potential of CO2 storage combining EOR is high; approximately 60% injected CO2 can be retained in the reservoir at the CO2 breakthrough if reinjection is not considered. It has been accepted that there is little major technical challenges for CO2 EOR projects, but there are economic constrictions if high cost anthropogenic CO2 (such as from power plant) is used for EOR and storage operations. In this chapter, a general revi ew is given on the CO2 EOR and storage potentials, field screening and economic analysis. A case study for CO2 EOR application in a North Sea field is also presented.

TI  - Evaluating terrestrial carbon sequestration options for Virginia
AB  - Changes in forest and agricultural land management practices have the potential to increase carbon (C) storage by terrestrial systems, thus offsetting C emissions to the atmosphere from energy production. This study assesses that potential for three terrestrial management practices within the state of Virginia, USA: afforestation of marginal agricultural lands; afforestation of riparian agricultural lands; and changing tillage practices for row crops; each was evaluated on a statewide basis and for seven regions within the state. Lands eligible for each practice were identified, and the C storage potential of each practice on those lands was estimated through a modeling procedure that utilized land-resource characteristics represented in Geographic Information System databases. Marginal agricultural lands' afforestation was found to have the greatest potential (1.4 Tg C yr-1, on average, over the first 20 years) if applied on all eligible lands, followed by riparian afforestation (0.2 Tg C yr-1 over 20 years) and tillage conversion (0.1 Tg C yr -1 over 14 years). The regions with the largest potentials are the Ridge and Valley of western Virginia (due to extensive areas of steep, shallow soils) and in the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain in eastern Virginia (wet soils). Although widespread and rapid implementation of the three modeled practices could be expected to offset only about 3.4% of Virginia's energy-related CO 2 emissions over the following 20 years (equivalent to about 8.5% of a Kyoto Treaty-based target), they could contribute to achievement of C-management goals if implemented along with other mitigation measures.

TI  - Carbon balance of a sewage-fed aquaculture wetland
AB  - Wetlands are considered as one of the most effective carbon (C) sink among various ecosystems. To substantiate this view, the present investigation was conducted in one of the units of sewage fed East Kolkata wetlands (EKW), a Ramsar site, over a period of 3years. The result revealed that because of high primary productivity due to abundance of primary producers and other sources of C input primarily through sewage influx, there is net positive balance of C in the system. The rate of C accumulation estimated through C budget was 1245.27-2490.55kg C ha(-1) year(-1) while the rate estimated through sediment core analysis came out to be 1584kg C ha(-1) year(-1). The amount of total C deposited up to 15cm depth in sediment was 29.37Mgha(-1), quite higher than the C deposited up to 15cm depth of reference upland soil which was measured at 23.79Mgha(-1). If C burial from this experiment in 55ha is up-scaled for entire EKW of 12,500ha area, then it empirically corresponds to 56.97-113.94 Gg CO2 captured from atmosphere per annum. EKW is not only used for aquaculture production thereby harvesting blue carbon but also has great potential to accumulate C in its sediments and thus helping mitigate climate change.

TI  - Trash to treasure: Seawater pretreatment by CO2 mineral carbonation using brine pretreatment waste of soda ash plant as alkali source
AB  - Mineral carbonation is one of the ways to reduce carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere, which has attracted industrial and academic interest for its permanent storage of CO2 with no leakage of threat. This paper focuses on development of new energy-saving and economic alkali sources for seawater decalcification by mineral carbonation process, with which not only carbon dioxide could be sequestrated, but also the calcium ions in the seawater could be removed. Magnesium hydroxide was firstly tested as the alkali source in a simple Ca2+,Mg2+/Cl--H2O system, showing the ability of assisting in the decalcification according to the monitor of calcium ions concentration in solution and the analytical results of the sediments using XRD and SEM. This innovative approach permits the use of moderate temperature and pressure conditions in the process of seawater decalcification with mineral carbonation and the production of pure CaCO3 with a potential sale value. Then it is inspired that the brine pretreatment waste of soda ash plant, mainly containing Mg(OH)(2) and CaCO3, may act as the alkali source. Therefore, the seawater decalcification processes using the brine pretreatment waste of soda ash plant as alkali source by CO2 were carried out. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - EFFECTIVENESS OF CO2 SEQUESTRATION IN THE OCEANS CONSIDERING LOCATION AND DEPTH
AB  - A carbon cycle model based on a 15 level ocean general circulation model is employed to estimate the effectiveness of ocean sequestration of fossil fuel derived CO2 at locations near Tokyo, San Francisco, New York, and Miami. Significant differences are found. Off the East Coast of the USA, the atmospheric concentration quickly rises to near the final equilibrium value, for all depths below about 800 m. Off the West Coast of the USA, the CO2 is effectively hidden from the atmosphere for several hundred years, for depths below 800 m. Then the atmospheric concentration rises to larger values than for sequestration off the East Coast. Sequestration off the coast of Japan at 800 m is similar to sequestration off the West Coast of the USA, but without the delay. These predicted differences are due to the effect of ocean circulation.

TI  - Effects of reservoir size and boundary conditions on pore-pressure buildup and fault reactivation during CO2 injection in deep geological reservoirs
AB  - The excessive burning of the fossil fuels has caused severe global climatic changes such as increasing the global temperature, causing initiation of the wild fire, rising the sea level, increasing the floods, storms, amount of rain and snow. One of the effective global mitigation strategies is sequestration of huge quantity of CO2 deep below the ground level for a long period of time. An important issue is to ensure the permanency and safety of the sequestration process due to the associated pore-pressure buildup. It is necessary to have correct estimates of the pore-pressure buildup, ground uplift and re-activation of any existing fault during the process of CO2 injection and long-term storage. In this investigation, the effects of reservoir size and boundary conditions are investigated by means of geomechanical modeling of the deep Biyadh sandstone reservoir in Saudi Arabia. Currently, carbon dioxide is not injected into the actual Biyadh reservoir. In this investigative modeling, CO2 is injected for an injection period of ten years using a single injection well at the center of the reservoir. The developed modeling scheme for a single injection well has been extended further to include multiple injection wells. For multiple injection wells, the reservoir size and locations of injection wells are varied to evaluate their effect on the pore-pressure buildup and ground uplift. The reservoir stability analysis has been performed using Mohrâ€“Coulomb failure criterion for both small and large reservoir models, with the same injection parameters. The simulation results demonstrated that pressure buildup and ground uplift are relatively higher for reservoirs with small sizes and closed boundaries; while in the case of large sizes and open boundaries, the pore-pressure buildup and ground uplift are relatively lower. Moreover, the effect of the reservoir size and boundary conditions on the reactivation of faults during CO2 injection has been evaluated. The stability analysis performed in this study shows that injecting CO2 into larger size reservoir is safer as compared to smaller size reservoir. Injecting CO2 with multiple injection wells will cause pore-pressure buildup of huge magnitudes. The modeling results show that suggesting a representative volume for the reservoir during CO2 injection can under-estimate the pore-pressure buildup and fault re-activation that can cause the reservoir failure and leakage of the stored CO2.

TI  - Spatial and temporal trends in total organic carbon (TOC), black carbon (BC), and toted nitrogen (TN) and their relationships under different planting patterns in a restored coastal mangrove wetland: case study in Fujian, China
AB  - This study aims to determine the sediment changes and the trends in TOC, BC and TN before and after restoration of the mangrove wetland in the Jinjiang Estuary and to determine the effect of the wetland restoration process on the biogeochemical cycle of carbon and nitrogen. The results suggest that the sediments were mainly silt-sized. Among different sites with different types of plants and vegetation densities, the adsorptive ability of N in the plots in plantations of Kandelia obovata, Avicennia marina and Acanthus ilicifolius was the highest. The TOC content differed (p < 0.05) with the density of the plot and significantly differed (p < 0.01) with the mangrove species at the densities of 0.5 x 1 m and 0.5 x 0.5 m. There was a positive relationship between the TOC and TN and the TOC and carbon-nitrogen ratio (C/N) (P < 0.05).

TI  - Development of improved caprock integrity analysis and risk assessment techniques
AB  - GeoMechanics Technologies has completed a geomechanical caprock integrity analysis and risk assessment study funded through the US Department of Energy. The project included: a detailed review of historical caprock integrity problems experienced in the natural gas storage industry; advanced coupled transport flow modelling and geomechanical simulation of three large-scale potential geologic sequestration sites to estimate geomechanical effects from large-scale CO2 injection; and development of a quantitative risk and decision analysis tool to assess caprock integrity risks. Historical data from gas storage operations and CO2 sequestration projects suggest that leakage and containment incident risks are on the order of 10(-1) to 10(-2), which is higher risk than some previous studies have suggested for CO2. Geomechanical analysis, as described herein, can be applied to quantify risks and to provide operating guidelines to reduce risks. The risk assessment tool developed for this project has been applied to five areas: The Wilmington Graben offshore Southern California, Kevin Dome in Montana, the Louden Field in Illinois, the Sleipner CO2 sequestration operation in the North Sea, and the In Salah CO2 sequestration operation in North Africa. Of these five, the Wilmington Graben setting represent the highest relative risk while the Kevin Dome setting represents the lowest relative risk. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - What is the best endpoint for assessing environmental risk associated with acidification caused by CO2 enrichment using mussels?
AB  - Carbon capture and storage is a technology that has been widely determined to be one of the best choices for the short-term reduction of atmospheric CO2 emissions. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of CO2 enrichment in the ocean on the mussel species Mytilus galloprovincialis using three different endpoints: mortality, embryo-larval development, and neutral red retention time assays (NRRT). Acute effects were found to be associated with a pH values of 6.0 while citotoxity effects and embryo-larval development were associated with a pH value of 7.0. The NRRT assay and embryo-larval development can be recommended as good endpoints for assessing the environmental risk associated with acidification by CO2 enrichment because they provide sensitive responses on the effects of changes in seawater pH on mussels in a short period of time. Moreover, this study may support policymakers in finding appropriate solutions for the conservation of marine ecosystems. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - An investigation on the solvent based carbon capture and storage system by process modeling and comparisons with another carbon control methods for different ships
AB  - This study investigates the effects of hydraulic design parameters of separation columns on the effectiveness of the solvent-based carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems and performs the cost analyses of CCS systems for different ships. The CCS and power systems of ships are simulated by using process modeling with Aspen HYSYS. A very large crude carrier (VLCC) tanker and three different sizes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers (Q-Max, Q-Flex, and conventional LNG carrier) are considered. The study also employs different carbon control methods such as speed reduction and LNG usage. These methods are compared in terms of their CO2 emission reduction effectiveness and costs. Comparisons between the speed reduction, LNG usage, and the CCS system show that the speed reduction is the best cost-oriented and easiest solution for ships with low freight values like crude oil tankers. However, for ships with high speed and freight values like Q-Max and Q-Flex LNG carriers, it is shown that the CCS is more cost-effective than other compared CO2 control methods. The results show that the CCS system is a promising and feasible method for reducing CO2 emissions of ships. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Long-Term Heavy Metal Retention by Mangroves and Effect on Its Growth: A Field Inventory and Scenario Simulation
AB  - The ability of mangroves in taking up and storing heavy metal (HM) helps in reducing HM pollution. However, HMs likewise adversely affect the growth of mangroves. We assess the effects of the long-term soil HMs enrichment on the growth of Rhizophora apiculata forest in the Can Gio Mangrove Forest (Southern Vietnam) in different environmental conditions of soil salinity, ground elevation, and tree density based on a novel set of measured data. These data were analyzed and were used to calibrate and validate for a tree growth model with influencing factors salinity, elevation, tree density, and heavy metals content. Three scenario simulations were performed to predict the mangrove dynamics under different levels of heavy metal pollution in combined environmental conditions of salinity and elevation. Simulation results show the decline of total forest biomass from 1,750,000 tons (baseline scenario with no HM pollution) down to 850,000 tons and 350,000 tons for the current HM pollution and double HM pollution scenarios, respectively. Both data analysis and simulations have shown that although mangroves can assist in reducing HM pollution, the quality and health of this ecosystem will be severely affected if the environment is excessively polluted. In addition, a data-and-model driven management tool is devised for the sustainable management of the mangrove environmental resources.

TI  - The hoax of ocean acidification
AB  - A widespread alarm is sweeping the world at present about the ill effects of man-made increases in carbon dioxide (CO2) production. One aspect is that it may cause the ocean to become acid, and dissolve the carbonate skeletons of many living things including shellfish and corals. However, the oceans are not acid, never have been in geological history, and cannot become acid in the future. Changes in atmospheric CO2 cannot produce an acid ocean. Marine life depends on CO2, and some plants and animals fix it as limestone. Over geological time enormous amounts of CO2 have been sequestered by living things, and today there is far more CO2 in limestones than in the atmosphere or ocean. Carbon dioxide in seawater does not dissolve coral reefs, but is essential to their survival. Â© 2019 Clifford Ollier published by Sciendo.

TI  - Degraded mangroves as sources of trace elements to aquatic environments
AB  - Mangrove forests have been reported as sinks for metals because of the immobilization of these elements in their soils. However, climate change may alter the functioning of these ecosystems. We aimed to assess the geochemical dynamics of Mn, Cu, and Zn in the soils of a mangrove forest dead by an extreme weather event in southeastern Brazil. Soil samples were collected from dead and live mangroves adjacent to each other. The physicochemical parameters (total organic carbon, redox potential, and pH), total metal content, particle size, and metal partitioning were determined. Distinct changes in the soil geochemical environment (establishment of suboxic conditions) and a considerable loss of fine particles was caused by the death of the mangroves. Our results also showed a loss of up to 93 \% of metals from soil. This study highlights the paradoxical role of mangroves as potential metal sources in the face of climate change.

TI  - Underwater photosynthesis and indirect use of HCO3- by completely submerged leaves of mangrove species Aegiceras corniculatum
AB  - Periodic tidal flooding imposes serious restraints to carbon fixation in mangroves due to the limits of gaseous CO2 and illumination. This may be especially problematic as sea-level rises and water turbidity increases. The capacity to maintain underwater photosynthesis is important for mangrove plants which grow in the intertidal zone. A pH drift experiment was used to test the hypotheses that mangrove leaves can maintain underwater photosynthesis to some extent through the use of HCO3- as the main carbon source. Net photosynthetic O2 evolution rates were measured when seedlings of Aegiceras corniculatum were periodically submerged in artificial seawater with pH 8.1-8.5 and 10.1-10.5, respectively, in the presence or absence of acetazolamide. Additionally, stomata status and density and pigment contents were determined on leaves grown in air or submerged in pH 8.1-8.5. The ability of A. corniculatum to maintain underwater photosynthesis was indicated by a relatively high rate of photosynthesis at pH 8.1-8.5 compared with pH 10.1-10.5. This photosynthetic activity partly resulted from indirect use of HCO3- and increased contents of chlorophyll a, b and carotene. External carbonic anhydrase might play a significant role in carbon acquisition. This kind enzyme has not been detected in other C3 plants. The further determination of the use of HCO3- by a broader range of mangrove species and exploration of the mechanism of underwater carbon capture warrant further study.

TI  - ESTIMATION OF MANGROVE CARBON STOCK (ABOVEGROUND) IN TANJUNG API-API, SOUTH SUMATERA
AB  - The rapid development of infrastructure that occurred in the area of Tanjung Api-api resulted in changes in the function of mangrove land along the coast. Directly, this also impacts on the sustainability of ecological functions of mangroves. This study aims to estimate changes (prior to infrastructure development and current conditions) of aboveground carbon reserves stored in mangrove forests in Tanjung Api-api. This research was conducted in June-August 2016. Carbon stocks in mangrove along Tanjung Api-api were conducted by surveying the mangrove species and density, and then calculating biomass and carbon stock using allometric equation. While changes in carbon stocks are calculated by converting changes in mangrove area before and after infrastructure development to carbon stock value. The change of mangrove area was done by doing image data processing in 2005 and 2016. The results showed that mangrove Tanjung Api-api has 9 species of mangrove with total mangrove aboveground biomass of Tanjung Api-api is 1.1498 Mg.ha(-1) and stored carbon of 0.5235 MgC.ha(-1) and able to absorb CO2 of 1.1921 MgC.ha(-1). The result of satellite image processing shows that there is a reduction of mangrove land of 1056.6 ha during the last 11 years from 9741.15 ha in 2005 (before development) to 8684.55 ha in 2016. Thus, there is a decrease of mangrove biomass by 1214.894 Mg, carbon stock is reduced by 553.090 MgC and CO2 uptake is reduced by 2029.84 MgC.

TI  - CO2 storage in depleted oil and gas fields in the Gulf of Mexico
AB  - Depleted oil and gas reservoirs are one of the prime-candidate formations for geologic CO2 storage. Although both the geological structure and the physical properties of most of them have been extensively studied and characterized, there is limited data on the assessment of the CO2 storage capacity, especially in the offshore fields. The purpose of this study is to develop a high-level quantitative assessment of the CO2 volume that can be stored in depleted oil and gas fields in the Federal offshore regions of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), both on a field-by-field and on a reservoir-by-reservoir basis. In this study, we simulated CO2 storage in 461 of the depleted oil and gas reservoirs (73 fields) among 3514 reservoirs (675 fields) in the GOM (2013 BOEM Reserves database). Based on the simulation results, we improved the Department of Energy (DOE) CO2 Storage Resource Estimate Equation to make more refined and accurate estimates of storable CO2 volumes. Newly revised efficiency factor (ERoil/gas) correlates better with hydrocarbon recovery factor (HCRF), which is found to be a strong indicator of the CO2 storage capacity of the reservoir. The higher HCRF results in higher ERoil/gas. The further investigations resulted in an improved, material balance-based correlationâ€”which is called the Production-CO2 Storage Correlationâ€”between cumulative production (free gas, oil and water) at reservoir conditions and CO2 storage volume at standard conditions. This relationship, which is unique for all three types of reservoirs (gas, oil and combination), allows for making direct estimates of CO2 storage volume using only existing production data. Application of these correlations to all of the depleted fields (3514 reservoirs) yields CO2 storage capacities of 4748 MMtons, and the CO2 storage capacity in all 1295 depleted and active fields (13,289 reservoirs) in the GOM calculated to be 21.57 Billion tons. If a 5000 psia surface injection pressure constraint was applied, these volumes would be reduced to 4075 MMtons for all depleted fields only and to 15.80 Billion tons for all depleted and active fields in the GOM. The production-CO2 storage correlations can be used to make more accurate CO2 storage volume estimates in all onshore and offshore depleted oil and gas fields. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Emerging challenges for sustainable development and forest conservation in Sarawak, Borneo
AB  - The forests of Borneo-the third largest island on the planet-sustain some of the highest biodiversity and carbon storage in the world. The forests also provide vital ecosystem services and livelihood support for millions of people in the region, including many indigenous communities. The Pan-Borneo Highway and several hydroelectric dams are planned or already under construction in Sarawak, a Malaysian state comprising part of the Borneo. This development seeks to enhance economic growth and regional connectivity, support community access to services, and promote industrial development. However, the implications of the development of highway and dams for forest integrity, biodiversity and ecosystem services remained largely unreported. We assessed these development projects using fine-scale biophysical and environmental data and found several environmental and socioeconomic risks associated with the projects. The highway and hydroelectric dam projects will impact 32 protected areas including numerous key habitats of threatened species such as the proboscis monkey (Nasalis larvatus), Sarawak surili (Presbytis chrysomelas), Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) and tufted ground squirrel (Rheithrosciurus macrotis). Under its slated development trajectory, the local and trans-national forest connectivity between Malaysian Borneo and Indonesian Borneo would also be substantially diminished. Nearly ~161 km of the Pan-Borneo Highway in Sarawak will traverse forested landscapes and ~55 km will traverse carbon-rich peatlands. The 13 hydroelectric dam projects will collectively impact ~1.7 million ha of forest in Sarawak. The consequences of planned highway and hydroelectric dams construction will increase the carbon footprint of development in the region. Moreover, many new road segments and hydroelectric dams would be built on steep slopes in high-rainfall zones and forested areas, increasing both construction and ongoing maintenance costs. The projects would also alter livelihood activities of downstream communities, risking their long-term sustainability. Overall, our findings identify major economic, social and environmental risks for several planned road segments in Sarawak-such as those between Telok Melano and Kuching; Sibu and Bintulu; and in the Lambir, Limbang and Lawas regions-and dam projects-such as Tutoh, Limbang, Lawas, Baram, Linau, Ulu Air and Baleh dams. Such projects need to be reviewed to ensure they reflect Borneo's unique environmental and forest ecosystem values, the aspirations of local communities and long-term sustainability of the projects rather than being assessed solely on their shortterm economic returns.

TI  - The sequestration of carbon dioxide to the deep ocean by fertilization
AB  - A discussion on the sequestration of CO2 to the deep ocean by the fertilization of high nutrient, low chlorophyll (HNLC) ocean waters, which has the potential to sequester CO2 for 1000 to 2000 yr for a cost of about $2/ton of CO2, covers a technology demonstration, which is planned to fertilize 5000 sq mi of the equatorial Pacific that is expected to sequester 600,000-2,000,000 ton of CO2 in 20 days; possible commercialization; and approaches for dealing with the increasing CO2 content in the atmosphere.

TI  - Changes in plant biomass induced by soil moisture variability drive interannual variation in the net ecosystem CO2 exchange over a reclaimed coastal wetland
AB  - Changes in the timing and magnitude of precipitation is a threat to agricultural productivity and farmland carbon stocks. However, the relationship between inter-annual variations in precipitation and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) remains to be clarified, particularly when combined with water-salt transport in reclaimed coastal wetland. Here, based on the eddy-covariance technique, we investigated the interannual variation in carbon dioxide exchange and its control mechanism over a reclaimed coastal wetland of the Yellow River Delta from 2010 to 2014. The coastal wetland functioned as a strong sink for atmospheric CO2, with the annual NEE of -229, -175, -142, -92 and -80 g C m(-2) in the 5 years from 2010 to 2014, respectively. Surprisingly, we find that large annual variation in net ecosystem exchange (NEE) can be predicted accurately using plant biomass. Plant biomass was driven by soil water content (SWC), with about 48\%-80\% seasonal variation of biomass attributed to SWC. During the early growing stage, high SWC accompanied with low salinity promoted plant biomass and NEE. While high SWC accompanied with increased waterlogged stress inhibited plant biomass and NEE during the middle growing stage. The same results were also observed in a field manipulation experiment over a nearby natural coastal wetland. Our study indicated that extreme climate accompanied with extreme drought and flooding may decrease carbon sequestration capacity of the reclaimed coastal wetland due to the increase in salinity.

TI  - Geologic CO2 storage in arkosic sandstones with CaCl2-rich formation water
AB  - The feasibility of geologic CO2 storage in deeply buried arkosic sandstones has been tested using high-temperature, high-pressure short-term laboratory experiments and long-term numerical simulations with CO2-saturated solution rich in CaCl2. These conditions mimic the conditions found today in the Eocene reservoir sandstones of depleted oilfields in the Dongying Sag, Bohai Bay Basin, China. Experiments at 100 Â°C and 150 Â°C and PCO2 of 4 MPa were conducted on sandstones rich in K-feldspar and albite without anorthite. During the experiments, calcite and kaolinite precipitated while albite and K-feldspar partly dissolved. Ca2+ in formation water is shown to be critical for mineral trapping of CO2. The continuous dissolution of K-feldspar and albite at a slow rate for a long time period can prolong duration time of calcite precipitation and increase geologic CO2 storage capability by mineral trapping. Addition of NaCl, KCl and MgCl2 can prolong the dissolution time of K-feldspar and albite and precipitation duration of calcite. It also increased the mass of sequestered CO2 by mineral trapping. The process of geologic CO2 storage can be divided into 3 stages. In stage I, calcite precipitates rapidly, and geologic CO2 storage is dominated by solubility trapping within 100 years. Stage II lasts up to 300 years in the solution without NaCl, KCl and MgCl2 and 900 years with addition of NaCl, KCl and MgCl2 into the solution. The precipitation rate of calcite decreases abruptly and the mass of mineral trapping of CO2 increases with increasing time, because dissolution of K-feldspar and albite causes decrease of Ca activity and prolongs calcite precipitation time. The geologic CO2 storage is dominated by mineral trapping. In stage III, reactions reach equilibrium and the mass of geologic CO2 storage reaches the maximum. The calculated mass of CO2 by mineral trapping in sandstones of the Es4x to Es3z in the Dongying Sag is about 3.61Gt. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration from 40 Years of Planting Genetically Improved Loblolly Pine across the Southeast United States
AB  - Highly productive, widely deployed genetically improved loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) may play an important role in mitigating rising atmospheric CO2 via carbon (C) sequestration. To understand the role of loblolly pine genetic improvement in future C sequestration strategies, we examined the historical (1968-2007) impact of operationally deploying improved families of loblolly pine on productivity and C sequestration across the southeast United States. Since 1977, nearly 100\% of loblolly pine plantations in the southeast United States have been established with genetically improved loblolly pine. In recent years, more than 400,000 ha of genetically improved loblolly pine are planted annually. Between 1968 and 2007, we estimate that genetically improved loblolly pine plantations have produced a total of 25.6 billion m(3) of stemwood volume and have sequestered 9,865 Tg C in live and dead biomass. Our estimates also indicate that genetic improvement has resulted in an additional 3.7 billion m(3) (17\% increase) and 1,100 Tg C (13\%) of volume production and C sequestration, respectively, relative to volume production and C sequestration with no genetic improvement. We expect that loblolly pine plantation C sequestration will increase as more productive families and clones are deployed and as currently deployed genetic material continues to mature. Together, genetic improvement, intensive silvicultural, and longer rotations aimed at producing long-lived wood products will be important tools for maximizing C sequestration in loblolly pine plantations.

TI  - Mangrove vulnerability index and carbon algorithm using sentinel-2a satellite data at Kemujan Island, Karimunjawa Islands, Indonesia
AB  - Mangroves are important for the environmental sustainability, contributing to the global warming control, but they remain highly vulnerable under the pressures of the anthropogenic activities. Information for mangrove carbon monitoring, such as mangrove coverage area with accurate spatial data, is urgently needed. The aim of the current research was to develop a mangrove carbon algorithm based on field and Sentinel-2A data, and a vulnerability index of mangrove ecosystems at Kemujan Island. Mangrove density was in the range of 1,021 and 2,829 ind ha-1. Mangrove sediment texture was dominated by sandy-clay-loam. The sediment organic matter content was of 0.4-24.4%, the sediment nitrate content was of 0.7702-4.4596 mg/L and the sediment phosphate content was of 0.0201-0.6354 mg L-1. The redox potential of sediment was of 134-332 mV. The highest carbon absorption was measured in Rhizophora apiculata (49.681 ton C ha-1). Carbon algorithm of R. stylosa was the best, according to the equation: mangrove carbon = 46.448 x (Band 4/Band 3)2-83.421 x (Band 4/Band 3) + 37.334, with the highest determination coefficient R2=0.9972 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.1378. The mangrove vulnerability index was found in the low to moderate category. Â© 2020, BIOFLUX SRL. All rights reserved.

TI  - Seasonal variations of net ecosystem (CO2) exchange in the Indian tropical mangrove forest of Pichavaram
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle. However, the carbon fluxes in the mangrove ecosystems found in the Indian subcontinent are not well understood. Here, for the first time, we estimate the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in a mangrove ecosystem at Pichavaram, southeast India, using the eddy covariance method for the period October 2017-September 2018. The half-hourly daytime NEE varied from-11.05 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in the winter months (January-March 2018) to -6.06 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) during the summer (April 2018). The estimated annual evapotranspiration during the study period was 610 mm, whereas the precipitation was 653 mm (much dryer than the long-term average). The half-hourly NEE data were gap filled and partitioned to estimate the gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco). The estimated annual GPP was 1466 gC m(-2) and Reco was 1283 gC m(-2). The mangrove forest appeared to be a modest sink of atmospheric CO2, with an annual average net ecosystem productivity of 183 gC m(-2). However, in the summer months, it acted as a source. We observed that the mangrove CO2 fluxes strongly responded to environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall, and salinity. However, it is noteworthy that the carbon sink capability may decline in the future due to rising temperatures, decreasing rainfall patterns, variation in salinity, and changes in tidal inundation patterns.

TI  - How carbon cycles through a forest
AB  - Beginning with the investment of solar energy and the reinvestment of carbon dioxide, water, and minerals from the soil, every forest is a source of sequestered carbon through photosynthesis, which is then stored and recycled worldwide. Within each forest, various mammals and birds eat mycorrhizal fungi that help connect the flow of energy from trees' crowns to their roots, and from their roots to their crowns. As trees grow, they sequester and store carbon. As they die and fall to the forest floor, they not only created a micro-topography that conserves water and helps prevents soil from creeping downslope but also reinvest their stored carbon and other elements in the soil, thereby nurturing the next forest. And, some of the fallen trees make their way, as driftwood, into the oceans, where they help balance the marine-carbon requirements that sustain oceanic life worldwide. Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Soil pH and carbon at different depth in three zones of mangrove forest in Sarawak, Malaysia
AB  - Mangrove forest is one of the potential areas for the carbon storage. A study on carbon storage in soil was carried out in the mangrove forest at Awat-Awat Mangrove Forest Reserve in Lawas, Sarawak, Malaysia to compare the carbon storage potential among three different zones (seaward, middleward and landward) and two different soil depths (0-20 cm and 20-40 cm). Standard procedures were used to determine soil chemical properties. There are significant differences in the carbon storage between the mangrove zones with the middleward zone being more efficient in storing carbon. However, there are no differences in the percentage of carbon stored at different soil depths.

TI  - CO2 injection for heat extraction and carbon sequestration in a geothermal site: Huizhou Sag, the Pearl River Mouth Basin
AB  - Recently more attention has been paid to CO2 geological storage combined with geothermal water recovery (CO2-EWR). In this regard, the production performance of a geothermal site in Huizhou Sag was evaluated. In the process of evaluation, a new technology in which cold water is injected through the tubing and CO2 through the annulus is used and simulated. In this study, a conceptual model was established by coupling the wellbore and the geothermal reservoir according to the field exploration data. The power production performance was evaluated by using the output from the wellbore-reservoir coupled simulation. The numerical simulation outputs showed a temperature difference of approximately 5.5Â Â°C from well bottom to wellhead at the beginning. The 3D-visualization of CO2 distribution demonstrates two steps of migration, vertical migration and horizontal spreading. It was also found that injecting water above CO2 plays a significant role in preventing rising of CO2 â€œbubbleâ€ in the early stages of injection process. The results of thermodynamic simulations suggests the desired thermal production efficiency and gross power output could be obtained. In addition, the impact of various parameters on simulation results were investigated and analyzed, the analysis results provided a better understanding of CO2-EWR (CO2 geological storage enhanced with geothermal resources recovery) technology as well as practical perforation depth of the wells.

TI  - Research results from the international collaboration on ocean carbon sequestration ocean engineering
AB  - This paper documents some of the ocean engineering challenges faced by the international team of scientists and engineers involved in an ocean carbon storage experiment since 1997. The project underwent a series of drastic changes that required a great deal of collaborative work across three continents. In general, the project team managed to remain enthusiastic in the face of adversity, while valuable lessons were learned. The importance of adequate ships (moonpool, dynamic positioning, ample deck space, cranes, etc.) and very experienced crew (ship and Remotely Operated Vehicles) was highlighted. Even though the ocean carbon storage experiment could not take place as planned in its latest incarnation, the CO2 delivery infrastructure known as the Transfer Barrier Accumulator System (TBAS) was completed and is ready for future use.

TI  - Root biomass and productivity in subtropical arid mangroves from the Gulf of California
AB  - Root biomass and productivity research provide valuable information for understanding the ecological processes that occur within mangroves. The data reported by different studies on belowground biomass suggest a high spatial variability, which local factors can control. In this study, the productivity and biomass of belowground roots and pneumatophores of arid mangroves were measured along with sediment and water physical-chemical characteristics in three mangrove zones of the arid region of the Gulf of California, Mexico. Core extraction was performed to measure belowground biomass; in addition, the root productivity was determined using the ingrowth core technique, and pneumatophores were sampled at the soil level. Sediment samples were collected monthly to determine texture, pH, bulk density, moisture content, and organic matter. The flood pattern was estimated using piezometers. The study ran from June 2018 to May 2019. An average root productivity was 213.7 g m(-2).year(-1), with belowground biomass (74.05 +/- 15.2 ton.ha(-1)) and pneumatophores of 5.69 +/- 0.92 ton.ha(-1). We conclude that the amount of root biomass in arid regions is inverse to the scrub-type mangrove's structural development, which stores up to 70\% more than the mangroves in tropical regions. Thus mangroves in arid regions play a role in belowground carbon storage, which depends on multiple variables simultaneously (i.e.: salinity, flood pattern, soil depth, interstitial ORP).

TI  - Optimising brine production for pressure management during CO2 sequestration in the bunter sandstone of the UK southern north sea
AB  - This paper focuses on pressure management via brine production optimisation to reduce reservoir pressure buildup during carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration using a geocellular model representing a sector of the Bunter Sandstone Formation. The Bunter Sandstone is a deep saline aquifer with high reservoir quality and is a leading candidate for potential CO2 capture and storage (CCS) in the UK. Brine production optimization during CO2 sequestration is necessary because it helps minimize brine waste and well construction and operational costs. In this paper, various sensitivity analyses were performed investigating well geometry, injection and production well spacing, pressure management and boundary condition effects. Two scenarios were investigated and development plans were proposed for annual injection of 7 MT/yr CO2 (Scenario 1), which is equivalent to the CO2 emissions of a 1.2 GW coal-fired power plant, and for scenario 2, where we aim to utilize the maximum storage capacity of the reservoir model. Three pressure management schemes were compared for each scenario: no pressure management or no brine production, passive pressure management where pressure relief holes are drilled and brine passively flows to seafloor without external energy, and active pressure management where brine is actively pumped out. Brine production rate and relief well patterns were evaluated and optimised. The results show that well perforation length and the use of deviated wells have a significant impact on injectivity improvement whereas well radius has little impact on injectivity. Symmetrical well placements between injection and production wells yields higher storage capacity than asymmetrical ones, and increasing the number of relief wells improves CO2 storage capacity. In the case of open boundary conditions, no pressure management is required because the reservoir quality enables pressure dissipation, resulting in a pressure buildup of less than 5 bars. In the case of closed boundary conditions, either passive or active pressure management is required to prevent seal failure from overpressurization of the reservoir and it also increases storage capacity. The cases with open boundaries, as expected, yield higher storage capacity than the cases with closed boundaries. In scenario 1, or assumed annual injection of 7 MT, storage capacity is 344 MT without pressure management and with open boundaries. This is compared to 332 and 328 MT for cases with closed boundaries and passive and active pressure management, respectively. In scenario 2, the maximum storage capacity of the model is 684 MT with no pressure management and open boundaries, and 504 and 683 MT with closed boundaries with passive and active pressure management, respectively. The storage efficiency ranges from 1 to 6% in scenario 1 to the highest at 12% in the maximum storage capacity case. In addition, three aquifer sizes; open boundary aquifer size of 2.43Ã—1012m3, an aquifer size of 1.8Ã—1010m3 based on pressure recharge studies of the Esmond Gas Field, and closed boundary aquifer size of 1.22Ã—1010m3, were compared for the optimised cases. The study shows that aquifer size has an impact on estimation of CO2 storage capacity. The storage capacities of the three aquifer size cases ranging from the largest to smallest without pressure management are 344, 105 and 74 MT, respectively.

TI  - Evaluation and Planning of Mangrove Restoration Programs in Sedari Village of Kerawang District, West Java: Contribution of PHE-ONWJ Coastal Development Programs
AB  - PERTAMINA Hulu Energy-Offshore North West Java (PHE-ONWJ), conducted a mangrove restoration activities in Sedari Village, Kerawang District. The program was conducted in collaboration with local community, which is named Mangrove Care Parents (OTAP/Orang Tua Asuh Pohon). The program is to assess the survivor rate of the planted mangrove; to evaluate factors that cause which influence the growth of the mangrove planted; and to plan an appropriate future mangrove restoration. The program consists of six phases. The current program consist of four phases. The phase 1 was started in 2012 on sedari riverbank and it was unsuccessful. The results of monitoring showed that, of the 15.000 seedlings planted only 2141 plants survived (14,3 \% in 2014). The high mortality of the planted plants was due to disposal of dregded material from river deepening project. This accident happened was due to lack of coordination with local governments. The phase 2 was started on November 2013 by planting 3.000 seedlings in Karang Sari Orchard. Lessons learned from the failure suggest that monitorning should be done more frequent, i.e. monthly, and if there are dead seedlings, replanting new seedling were applied (called ``tambal sulam{''}). The phase 3 and 4 was started in March and June 2014 each by planting 10.000 seedlings on abandoned fishponds in Tirta Sari Orchard and Tanjung Sari Orchard. The phase 5 and 6 will be done by the end of this year, the preparation was done by defining of locations of lands and signing agreements with land owner. The evaluation done by analyzing the soil texture in order to know the suitability between soil texture and mangrove species. Phase 1 untill 4, the mangrove species were suitable with the soil texture. Planning for mangrove restoration programs on phase 5 and 6 were selecting appropriate mangrove species to be planted. The soil texture on phase 5 were Clay, the suitable mangrove species were Rhizophora mucronata and R. stylosa. Meanwhile on phase 6 the soil texture were Silty Clay, so the suitable mangrove species were Avicennia alba, Rhizophora mucronata, and R. stylosa. Beside the suitability between the soil texture and the mangrove species planted, the research recommend a survey of awareness level of stakeholders and the knowledge on the mangrove function and benefit.

TI  - A removal of Zn metal concentrate using Rhizophora apiculata mangrove plants
AB  - Pollutants from industrial waste can pollute the river water and have a negative impact in estuary ecosystem, changes in heavy metal content. One of the industries whose waste contains heavy metals (Chromium, Cyanide, Copper, Zinc, Nickel, Lead and Cadmium) is the electroplating industry. The purpose of this study is to calculate how much the efficiency of Rhizophora apiculata mangrove plants in Zn metal removal made from ZnSO4.7H(2)O artificial solution using laboratory scale reactor with the batch system. Plant acclimatization process has been done with Zn metal exposure test for seven days using soil media without pollutants and using tap water. After the acclimatization, preliminary test in the form of Range Finding Test (RFT) was conducted. The results of the RFT were concentrations of 100 mg/L, 200 mg/L, 300 mg/L which were feasible to be used in the main study phase. The main study phase was done by adding artificial solution into each tub of plastic reactor measuring 270 mm x 233 mm which has been filled with Rhizophora apiculata mangrove plant along with soil media. Samples were taken every five days within 20 days, and Zn concentration was measured using a spectrophotometer. The pH and temperature measurements were intended to monitor whether the pH and temperature of the waste water during the study were within the normal range for Rhizophora apiculata growth. Based on the result of the study, the efficiency of metal removal of Rhizophora apiculata mangrove plant at a concentration of 100 mg/L was 89,83\%, at concentration 200 mg/L the efficiency of metal removal was 84,92\% and at the concentration 300 mg/L the efficiency of metal removal was 74,94\%.

TI  - MCSEM inversion for CO2 sequestration monitoring at a deep brine aquifer in a shallow sea
AB  - The feasibility of marine controlled-source Electromagnetic (mCSEM) monitoring for CO2 sequestration could be evaluated by the analysis of EM responses due to injected CO2. However, its capability for the real CO2 sequestration case should be verified by the inversion approach with reasonable monitoring scenario. In this study, we developed a 2.5D mCSEM inversion algorithm and analyzed integrated sensitivity for successful inversion. Based on the result of sensitivity analysis, 2.5D inversion is applied to horizontal CO2 injection model with reasonable a priori information of the monitoring. In addition, we exploited modified secondary (MS) field method and sharp boundary constraint in inversion to enhance the resolution of our inverse problem. Â© 2012 SEG.

TI  - Biodiversity and biological impact of ocean disposal of carbon dioxide
AB  - Five major characteristics of deep-sea organisms that are relevant to the carbon dioxide ocean sequestration are pointed out. They are (1) Low biological activities, (2) Long life span, (3) High sensitivity to the environmental disturbance, (4) High species diversity, an (5) Low density. These characteristics suggest the deep-sea species are sensitive to the environmental disturbance, and once they are damaged, they may extinct easily or it takes a long time to recover. To get public acceptance for ocean sequestration of carbon dioxide, we need a reliable assessment of its affects on the deep-sea ecosystem based on an accurate model. For a better modeling, data regarding the long-term (chronic) effect of slightly increased concentration of carbon dioxide on the deep-sea organisms are prerequisite. Precise data regarding such biological characteristics can be obtained only from in-situ experiments. To develop a system for ecophysiological in-situ experiments of deepsea organisms is thus as important as solving the technological problems related to the ocean sequestration of carbon dioxide.

TI  - Corrigendum to â€œDeveloped-developing world partnerships for sustainable development (1): An ecosystem services perspectiveâ€ (Ecosystem Services (2017) 24 (241â€“252), (S2212041616303606) (10.1016/j.ecoser.2016.09.020))
AB  - The authors have identified an error in referenced source literature used in calculations in the above paper. Ramachandran et al. (2007, Current Science 92(3), pp. 323â€“331) wrongly cited the carbon content of tropical evergreen forest, stating a â€œVegetation biomass carbon density of 0.60 Tg haâˆ’1 in semi-evergreen forestsâ€. In fact, after reworking other data presented in that paper, we found that the original reference should have quoted 0.60 Tg as the total figure for the entire forest area (rather than per hectare). We regret our propagation of this error. As a result of our extrapolation from this stated value, the deduced values in our paper for potential CO2 equivalent (CO2e) sequestration in tropical dry evergreen forest (TDEF) are substantially overestimated. In a subsequent paper (Everard et al., 2018, Ecosystem Services 33 Part B, Pages 173â€“181), we recalculate potential CO2e sequestration of restored TDEF on India's Coromandel Coast. Over a 20-year operational life, 2.1 MW wind turbines installed under The Converging World (TCW) model conservatively avert 80,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions and also generate financial resources to fund 123 ha of TDEF restoration. Using revised potential CO2e sequestration values, 123 ha of TDEF would be expected to sequester 131,638 tCO2e, or over 160% of the value averted by each turbine (subject to substantial uncertainties). The authors would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused. Â© 2018

TI  - CO2 sequestration in deep sedimentary formations of the southwestern margin of the Ulleung Basin, offshore, east sea, Korea
AB  - A theoretical CO2 storage capacity of the southwestern margin (ca. 13,000 km2) of Ulleung Basin, offshore Korea is estimated using the relatively large amount of exploratory data including 2D (ca. 8,500 L-km) / 3D (ca. 2,400 km2) multi-channel reflection seismic data integrated with twenty-three (23) well bore data that had been acquired in the area through exploration activities over the two decades since the late 1980s. The study area is located between the Korea Peninsular to the west and the Japanese Arc to the east, and it is divided into two distinct regions: one is a tectonically deformed area (Dolgorae) and the other is a relatively less influenced area by the plate motions (Gorae) during the Tertiary. The KNOC (Korea National Oil Corporation) has discovered several discoveries in the areas one of which is a commercially producing gas field (Dong-Hae 1). The study area is believed to be evolved as a rifted basin margin during the Oligocene followed by a rapid thermal subsidence until the early Miocene, accumulating alluvial/fluvio-deltaic sediments across the entire area. During the middle Miocene, the subsidence was ceased by a tectonically induced compressional stress from both the south by the Philippine plate and the east by the Pacific plate, producing faulted and folded structural features which are the main targets for CO2 sequestration as well as hydrocarbon exploration. The uplifted areas provided relatively long-lasting sediment sources contributing to the formation of a continental-shelf-to-slope system that reaches a maximum thickness of 10 km. The thick sediment filling is the focus of the study. The prestack time-migrated 2D/ 3D seismic data were interpreted using a conventional seismic interpretation technique to identify sequences bounded by regional unconformities above and below throughout the Gorae area within a limited depth of 2,200 m, considering both sealing capability above 800 m and tightness of the formation below 3,000 m. The seismic interpretation results in five different seismic units, although ten sequences are recognized, in the time domain that are converted into the depth domain using an average velocity from checkshot surveys conducted in the area. To estimate possibly effective CO2 storage volumes, the depth-converted seismic sequences are limited in area of the shelf margins prior to incorporation of the other required parameters that include porosity and permeability from the borehole data, and theoretically inferred CO2 density with depth. In addition, an efficient factor defined by a depositional environment (i.e., continental shelf) which is, for the first time in Korea, used for the greenhouse-gas storage capacity calculation. The factor was evaluated by comparing levels P10, P50, and P90, representing 2.2%, 5.5%, and 13.7%, respectively, and the corresponding accumulated possible storage volumes in the study are 2,053 Mton, 5,131 Mton, and 12,782 Mton. The theoretically computed potential volumes will be effectively revised not only because the entire area is investigated in the next phase but also because more variables will be considered. The approaches made in this study will be applied to the other continental shelves (i.e., Yellow Sea and northern part of East China Sea) around the Korean Peninsula. Â© 2012 IEEE.

TI  - Restoration and sequestration of carbon and nitrogen in the degraded northern coastal area in Nile Delta, Egypt for climate change mitigation
AB  - Most of coastal area in Nile Delta, Egypt, is salt-affected soils and have low carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) inputs as a result of declining vegetation growth and low net primary production. Therefore, this study amid to compare between C and N pools in degraded (uncultivated and salt-affected soil) and restored (cultivated and reclaimed 20 years ago) locations in North Nile Delta. and to examine the impact of cultivation on sequestering C and N pools in this area as one of the most important methods for mitigating climate change impacts. C and N pools increased significantly in surface soil from 2.99 and 0.43 Mgh(-1) in uncultivated sites to 19.26 and 1.66 Mgh(-1) in cultivated ones as salinity was reduced and net primary production was increased due to leaching and reclamation. Particulate (associated with sand) and nonparticulate (associated with clay +silt) soil organic C or N was significantly higher cultivated sites. In addition, nonparticulate organic C or N was lower than particulate part indicating and supporting the strong relationship between organic matter and clay. The sequestration rate (in approximately 1 m profile) was 1.69 and 0.14 Mgh(-1) yr.(-1) C and N pools respectively. Although the cultivation is leading to loss of organic matter in some areas; C and N in this coastal area are partially restored and stored. Therefore, restoration and appropriate management practices will lead to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change in this area.

TI  - Ecosystem-Atmosphere Exchange of CO2, Water, and Energy in a Basin Mangrove of the Northeastern Coast of the Yucatan Peninsula
AB  - Coastal settings variations are linked to composition, structural, and functional differences among mangrove ecotypes. Basin mangroves undergo larger flooding and salinity fluctuations, yet remain understudied, compared to other ecotypes. We evaluated the effect of flooding and air temperature (T a) on the surface energy balance and eddy covariance-derived net CO2 ecosystem exchange (NEE) of a basin mangrove with sporadic freshwater flooding. During the study period (June 2017â€“November 2018) the site was more frequently not flooded. Under these conditions, in combination with high T a (&gt;27Â°C), daytime CO2 uptake was significantly lower, while evapotranspiration and sensible heat flux were higher than when flooded. CO2 uptake increased with T a and vapor pressure deficit, but after exceeding a threshold (29Â°C and 1.4Â kPa), uptake declined. Flooding extended this T a threshold by 3Â°C and increased the radiation saturation point of NEE. The ecosystem is a net sink of CO2 annually (709Â Â±Â 09Â g C mâˆ’2Â yrâˆ’1), however, it turned a net source of CO2 for 3Â months of prolonged rainfall deficit. Most of the precipitation input is returned to the atmosphere (evaporative index: 0.94) and on average, for each gram of atmospheric carbon assimilated into the ecosystem, 2.21Â Â±Â 0.50Â kg of water was returned to the atmosphere. This ecosystem-level water-use efficiency decreased with flooding, but the correlation was not strong. Future temperature increases and lower precipitation (local and regional), combined with lower water table (and/or stronger saline intrusion), imply important losses of primary productivity and stored soil carbon in basin mangroves of northeast Yucatan Peninsula.

TI  - The effects of low seawater pH on energy storage and heat shock protein 70 expression in a bivalve Limecola balthica
AB  - Though biological consequences of CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) implementation into the marine environment have received substantial research attention, the impact of potential CO2 leakage on benthic infauna in the Baltic Sea remained poorly recognized. This study quantified medium-term (56-day laboratory exposure) effects of CO2-induced seawater acidification (pH 7.7, 7.0 and 6.3) on energetic reserves and heat-shock protein HSP70 expression of adult bivalve Limecola balthica from the southern Baltic. While no clear impact was evident in the most acidic treatment (pH 6.3), moderate seawater hypercapnia (pH 7.0) induced elevated catabolism of high caloric reserves (carbohydrates including glycogen and lipids) in order to provide energy to cover enhanced metabolic requirements for acid-base regulation. Biochemical response did not involve, however, breakdown of proteins, suggesting that they were not utilized as metabolic substrates. As indicated also by subtle variations in the chaperone protein HSP70, the clams demonstrated high CO2 tolerance, presumably through development of efficient defensive/compensatory mechanisms during their larval and/or ontogenic life stages.

TI  - A comprehensive assessment of mangrove species and carbon stock on Pohnpei, Micronesia
AB  - Mangrove forests are the most important ecosystems on Pohnpei Island, Federated States of Micronesia, as the island communities of the central Pacific rely on the forests for many essential services including protection from sea-level rise that is occurring at a greater pace than the global average. As part of a multi-component assessment to evaluate vulnerabilities of mangrove forests on Pohnpei, mangrove forests were mapped at two points in time: 1983 and 2018. In 2018, the island had 6,426 ha of mangrove forest. Change analysis indicated a slight (0.76%) increase of mangrove area between 1983 and 2018, contrasting with global mangrove area declines. Forest structure and aboveground carbon (AGC) stocks were inventoried using a systematic sampling of field survey plots and extrapolated to the island using k-nearest neighbor and random forest species models. A gridded or wall to wall approach is suggested when possible for defining carbon stocks of a large area due to high variability seen in our data. The k-nearest neighbor model performed better than random forest models to map species dominance in these forests. Mean AGC was 167 Â± 11 MgC ha-1, which is greater than the global average of mangroves (115 Â± 7 MgC ha-1) but within their global range (37â€“255 MgC ha-1) Kauffman et al. (2020). In 2018, Pohnpei mangroves contained over 1.07 million MgC in AGC pools. By assigning the mean AGC stock per species per area to the map, carbon stock distributions were visualized spatially, allowing future conservation efforts to be directed to carbon dense stands.

TI  - A unique bacterial and archaeal diversity make mangrove a green production system compared to rice in wetland ecology: A metagenomic approach
AB  - Mangrove provides significant ecosystem services, however, 40% of tropical mangrove was lost in last century due to climate change induced sea-level rise and anthropogenic activities. Sundarban-India, the largest contiguous mangrove of the world lost 10.5% of its green during 1930â€“2013 which primarily converted to rice-based systems. Presently degraded mangrove and adjacent rice ecology in Sundarban-India placed side by side and create typical ecology which is distinct in nature in respect to soil physicochemical properties, carbon dynamics, and microbial diversities. We investigated the structural and functional diversities of bacteria and archaea through Illumina MiSeq metagenomic analysis using V3â€“V4 region of 16S rRNA gene approach that drives greenhouse gases emission and carbon-pools. Remote sensing-data base were used to select the sites for collecting the soil and gas samples. The methane and nitrous oxide emissions were lower in mangrove (âˆ’0.04 mg mâˆ’2 hâˆ’1 and âˆ’52.8 Î¼g mâˆ’2 hâˆ’1) than rice (0.26 mg mâˆ’2 hâˆ’1 and 44.7 Î¼g mâˆ’2 hâˆ’1) due to less availability of carbon-substrates and higher sulphate availability (85.8% more than rice). The soil labile carbon-pools were more in mangrove, but lower microbial activities were noticed due to stress conditions. A unique microbial feature indicated by higher methanotrophs: methanogens (11.2), sulphur reducing bacteria (SRB): methanogens (93.2) ratios and lower functional diversity (7.5%) in mangrove than rice. These could be the key drivers of lower global warming potential (GWP) in mangrove that make it a green production system. Therefore, labile carbon build-up potential (38%) with less GWP (63%) even in degraded-mangrove makes it a clean production system than wetland-rice that has high potential to climate change mitigation. The whole genome metagenomic analysis would be the future research priority to identify the predominant enzymatic pathways which govern the methanogenesis and methanotrophy in this system.

TI  - Oceans, IUU Fishing, and Climate Change: Implications for International Law
AB  - Illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing poses a significant threat to marine fisheries and biodiversity only outpaced by the projected impacts of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. Ocean warming might affect fish stocks, their health and migratory routes. Ocean acidification and de-oxygenation are another two phenomena that might affect certain marine species as well as entire marine ecosystems. Rebuilding of overexploited and depleted fisheries and managing fisheries sustainably will require comprehensive governance structures for port, flag, coastal and market states, which also address the causes and impacts of climate change. Addressing those concerns could open for opportunities for comprehensive and synergetic regulation. This article addresses potential synergies between oceans and climate governance; focusing on the role of oceans in addressing climate change and its adverse impacts. Suggestions to this end include (i) increasing ocean-based renewable energy, (ii) de-carbonizing ocean-based transport, and (iii) pursuing integrated management of fisheries and aquaculture.

TI  - Assessing geochemical reactions during CO2 injection into an oil-bearing reef in the Northern Michigan basin
AB  - The Dover 33 Reef, part of the Niagaran Reef Complex in Northern Michigan (USA), has been the focus of an enhanced oil recovery/carbon capture utilization and storage (EOR/CCUS) project as part of the Phase III-Midwest Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (Gupta et al., 2013a,b). The Dover 33 structure has experienced significant CO2 flooding in the past two decades, and over the course of the current injection study (between February 2013 and July 2016) has received approximately 100 to 1000 tonnes/day into the central injection well (L-M) 1â€“33). As part of the geochemical monitoring effort of the study, gas and fluid samples were collected from Dover 33 reef, and several other nearby reef structures, to assess the impact of CO2 injection on the geochemical processes occurring within in the reef. The injected gas is composed of approximately 95% CO2, with a Î´13CCO2 of âˆ¼20.5â€° which is consistent with previously published compositions of Antrim shale gas, the source of the CO2. The concentrations and isotopic compositions of higher pressure gas collected from the L-M 5â€“33 monitoring well were similar to those measured in the injection well, but did exhibit a small but systematic shift in isotopic composition towards lower values over the course of the study, suggesting mixing and dilution between the gas in the reservoir and the injected gas. In contrast the Î´13CCO2 of gas samples from the monitoring well with the lower surface pressure, L-M 2â€“33, are consistently lower throughout the study, âˆ¼18.5â€° indicating that reactions with the injected CO2 are occurring within the reef or with the well casing. Fluid samples were collected to assess the extent of interaction among the injected gas, the reservoir rock, and the brine. The brine samples are acidic (pH âˆ¼ 4.1 to 4.9) with a total salt content of nearly 400 g/L. Analysis of the isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the Dover 33 brine shows that Î´13C is higher than the injected gas (27â€“33â€°) suggesting that the gas is not in equilibrium with DIC in the brine, and that there has been little isotopic exchange with carbonate minerals in the reef. The water isotope composition of the brine, Î´18O and Î´D, plot below the meteoric water line, indicating that the water is not of recent meteoric origin and has undergone isotopic exchange with both gas and minerals within the reef structure. The 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the brine samples range from 0.70865 to 0.70869, consistent with Silurian seawater composition. Geochemical modelling of the brine composition shows that the predicted CO2 solubility as DIC is much greater than the measured DIC, and that the brines are supersaturated with respect to carbonate minerals, suggesting the potential for significant trapping of CO2 in both dissolved and mineral form.

TI  - Impact of mangrove vegetation on seasonal carbon burial and other sediment characteristics in the Vellar-Coleroon estuary, India
AB  - This work quantified the total carbon and 12 other sediment characteristics at 10 soil depths, in planted and or natural mangrove forests in comparison with non-vegetated soil for four seasons of the year 2009â€“2010 in the Vellar-Coleroon estuarine complex, India. The sediment characteristics varied significantly between mangrove-vegetated and non-vegetated habitats or seasons of analysis, but not between soil depths. The mangrove sediments were rich in total carbon and total organic carbon as compared to non-mangrove sediments (p <0.01). Total carbon was 98.2% higher in mature mangroves and 41.8% in planted mangroves than that in non-mangrove soil. Total organic carbon was as much as 2.5 times greater in mature mangroves and 2 times greater in planted mangroves than that in unvegetated soil. Carbon contents also varied many fold by season. Total carbon content was 8.6 times greater during pre-monsoon, 4.1 times greater during post-monsoon and 2.5 times greater during monsoon than during summer (p<0.01 in all cases). Similarly, total organic carbon was 5.9 times greater during pre-monsoon, 3.1 times greater during post-monsoon and 69% greater during monsoon than during summer. In general, higher levels of sediment carbon were recorded during pre and post-monsoon seasons than during other seasons. Total carbon concentration was correlated negatively to temperature, sand and phosphorus (p <0.01); positively correlated with redox potential, silt, clay, C/N ratio, potassium (p <0.01) and nitrogen (p <0.05); but not correlated with soil depth, pH or salinity. This work revealed that the carbon burial was rapid at the annual rate of 2.8% for total carbon, and 6.7% for total organic carbon in mangrove-planted sediment. Clearing of mangroves can result in significantly and rapidly reduced carbon stores. Our study highlights the importance of natural and plantation mangrove stands for conserving sediment carbon in the tropical coastal domain.

TI  - Soil carbon storage in mangroves is primarily controlled by soil properties: A study at Dongzhai Bay, China
AB  - Coastal wetlands are well known for their considerable capacity to store carbon (C). However, the spatial patterns and major controls of soil C concentration and C density in coastal wetlands remain poorly known. We measured soil total C concentration up to one meter depth and assessed environmental and biological factors influencing soil C input and decomposition processes across various geomorphologic settings and mangrove forest types at Dongzhai Bay, China. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to determine the causal pathways of influencing factors on soil C concentration. We found that the variation pattern of soil C concentration across geomorphologic settings and forest types was mirrored by soil properties. From 68 to 94% (varying with soil depth) variations of soil C concentration were explained by the inter-related influencing factors included in SEM. In the upper 60 cm soil layers, soil moisture was the most important factor affecting soil C concentration. In the 60â€“100 cm subsoil zone, the proportion of finer soil particles was the primary control of soil C concentration variation. In contrast, aboveground biomass and nearness of sampling site to the open water, which affect autochthonous and allochthonous C inputs, had relatively weak effects on soil C concentration compared to soil properties, which affect C decomposition. Soil C concentration was a good predictor of soil C density at all soil depths. The results suggest that top- and subsoil C concentrations in mangroves are subjected to different environmental controls, but taken together, mangrove soil C storage may be primarily controlled by soil property-mediated C decomposition rate. Subsoil C deserves more attention since it may respond differently to environmental changes than the better-known topsoil C. Â© 2017

TI  - Effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil organic carbon composition of mangrove wetland in Zhangjiang River Estuary
AB  - Aims The composition of soil organic carbon has been changed significantly in mangrove ecosystems due to the invasion of Spartina alterniflora in recent years. However, few studies were reported on functional groups of soil organic carbon in the two communities. The object of this study was to understand the differences in soil carbon pool and organic carbon functional group characteristics in mangrove community and S. alterniflora community of Zhangjiang Mangrove Nature Reserve in Fujian Province. Methods We used the method of â€œspace for timeâ€ to study the changes of soil carbon composition following the invasion of S. alterniflora. Three transects were selected from landward to seaward in the wetland of Zhangjiang Mangrove Nature Reserve in Fujian Province, with three sampling sites in each transect: mangrove community (MC), transitional community (TC), and S. alterniflora community (SC). We sampled three plots in each site for replicates. Soil samples from five soil layers at 0-100 cm were collected to analyze the characteristics of total organic carbon (TOC), particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolve organic carbon (DOC). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to analyze the functional group characteristics for surface (0-15 cm) and deep layers (75-100 cm). Important findings We found that: (1) soil organic carbon decreased from MC to SC, with TOC and POC following the pattern of MC > TC > SC. However, the DOC did not show a clear trend. (2) The functional groups of soil organic carbon in all vegetation types were mainly alkyl carbon and alkoxy carbon, followed by aromatic carbon and carbonyl carbon. In the surface soil 0-15 cm, the alkyl carbon and alkoxy carbon showed an increasing trend from MC to SC. The aromatic carbon and phenolic carbon decreased from MC to SC. In the deep layer of 75-100 cm soil, however, soil organic carbon composition showed no significant difference among the three communities. (3) In the surface 0-15 cm soil, alkyl carbon/alkoxy carbon showed the following pattern: SC > MC > TC; SC has the least aromaticity; hydrophobic carbon/hydrophilic carbon showed no significant difference; aliphatic carbon/aromatic carbon showed larger values in SC than in MC and TC. At the depth of 75-100 cm, there were no significant differences for all the ratios. In summary, the carbon storage of MC was higher than that of SC. The decomposition rate of soil organic carbon of SC in surface soil layer was higher than that of MC, indicating more complex organic carbon in MC. The deep layer carbon pool was more stable and less affected by vegetation type. The results indicated that S. alterniflora would reduce soil carbon storage after invading mangroves, as well as changing the composition of soil organic carbon functional groups. The molecular structure of soil organic carbon in SC was simpler than MC, and the degree of decomposition was greater in SC than MC. Â© 2018 Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Plant Ecology.

TI  - Nickel nanoparticle-revolutionizing the way of carbon capture & storage
AB  - Storing CO2 in geologic strata, over a long period of time, includes three mechanisms of capillary trapping, dissolution trapping, and mineralization. Due to its low density and viscosity mobile CO2 will rise in the geological strata and also the current estimations suggest that it will take more than 1000 years for CO2 to permanently trap in the formation as a result of solubilization or mineral trapping. It is a key concern for CO2 storage, since sequestered CO2 will potentially rise through the geologic strata and be emitted back into the atmosphere. Here we propose a new strategy for carbon storage where CO2 is injected and bubbled through water in an ongoing operating reaction vessel after emplacement of Nickel nanoparticles which converts gaseous CO2 into carbonates. What nickel nanoparticles do is accelerate the natural conversion of CO2 to carbonic acid. The catalytic activity of the Nickel is pH independent and as they are water insoluble and magnetic so they can be magnetically separated for reuse. And the most important advantage of this technique is that, CO2 does not require to be monitored because it is present in the solid carbonate form whereas in the conventional method the concentrated CO2 is compressed into liquid and piped underground which has to be looked after for leakage. Turning CO2 gas into a solid that is stable over geological time will be economical. Buildings can be constructed using the carbonate, it can be dumped into the large holes, whatever, but after that it can be ignored. The CO2 will not be able to escape and no one has to pay attention to it. Copyright Â© (2015) by the Offshore Technology Conference All rights reserved.

TI  - Nutritional composition of suspended particulate matter in a tropical mangrove creek during a tidal cycle (Can Gio, Vietnam)
AB  - Mangrove forests are highly productive ecosystems and mangrove-derived organic matter has generally been assumed to play a basal role in sustaining coastal food webs. However, the mechanisms of mangrove-derived organic matter utilisation by consumers are not fully understood. In this study, we were interested in hourly changes in the nutritional quality of suspended particulate matter (SPM) entering and departing a mangrove creek during a tidal cycle. We determined the fatty acid composition and delta C-13 stable isotope signature of SPM during a 26 h tidal cycle in a creek of the Can Gio Mangrove Biosphere Reserve (Southern Vietnam). Regarding fatty acids, the nutritional quality of SPM was low during most of the tidal cycle. However, it greatly increased during the first part of the strongest flood tide, occurring during daytime. The pulse of highly nutritive organic matter brought to the ecosystem was mostly composed of algal cells growing in specific shallow zones of the mangrove, that use nutrients and CO2 exported during the preceding ebb tide and originating from the mineralisation of mangrove-derived organic matter, as evidenced by their delta C-13 signatures. This study confirms that mangrove-derived carbon plays a basal role in sustaining trophic webs of mangrove tidal creeks, but that its nutritive value is greatly enhanced when a first step of mineralisation is achieved and CO2 is photo-synthesised by algal cells.

TI  - An investigation of the variation in the sweep and diffusion front displacement as a function of reservoir temperature and seepage velocity with implications in CO2 sequestration
AB  - The steady accumulation of greenhouse gases resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels has led to an increase in the amount of solar radiation trapped between the atmosphere and earth. This increased radiation raises the temperature of the earth's atmosphere and ocean systems. It is believed that continuing increases in temperature will lead to catastrophic changes in weather conditions around the globe. With carbon dioxide (CO2) being the most abundant greenhouse gas, many efforts are underway to reduce the level of CO2 entering the atmosphere. One promising technology involves the sequestration of CO2 in deep geologic formations. CO2 is first separated from flue gas expelled by coal fired power plants, compressed to a supercritical phase (ScCO2), and injected into underground formations such as exhausted gas reservoirs and deep brine aquifers. Flue gas normally contains 10% to 15% CO2 by volume. It is believed that CO2 can remain permanently sequestered in such formations, depending on the chemical and mechanical characteristics of the underground resident water and rock constituents. However, uncertainties remain in several areas such as the chemical and physical effects of CO2 injection on subsurface rocks which may introduce unwanted side-effects that could hamper long-term sequestration, such as induced seismicity. Risk estimation of short- and long-term geologic storage of CO2 can only be addressed through numerical modeling and simulation. In this paper we examine a short-term side-effect of CO2 injection in which an acidic fluid region develops ahead of the main CO2-rich water injectant. It is shown that the length of this low pH region varies with injectant velocity and reservoir temperature. A leading fluid region of low pH could have an effect on the wetability of formation minerals and the capillarity of the moving effluent. An advancing low pH front may increase the wetability of mineral surfaces which would improve CO2 sequestration efficiency and aid in enhanced oil recovery operations.

TI  - The geological risks of exploring for a CO2 storage reservoir
AB  - Experience of developing saline aquifers as CO2 storage sites is limited. Drawing on the experience of hydrocarbon exploration, there are geological risks that may be encountered during the search for CO2 storage sites, such as finding a reservoir of insufficient thickness, of low porosity or lacking an adequate seal. We use drilling records of 382 hydrocarbon boreholes on the UK Continental Shelf to analyse the geological risks of exploring for a new CO2 storage reservoir, on the assumption that the probability of occurrence of geological risks are similar. The most significant risks for a new borehole are the absence of the target reservoir (19Â Â±Â 3% of cases), low reservoir quality (16Â Â±Â 5%) and lack of trap (16Â Â±Â 3%). Overall, 49Â Â±Â 8% of subsurface structures, identified from seismic data, can potentially store CO2. For saline aquifers that have already been penetrated by wells within the potential storage site, most of the geological risks are eliminated or at least reduced; reservoir compartmentalization is the major remaining geological risk. This study demonstrates a method to quantitatively apply drilling data from hydrocarbon exploration to the exploration for CO2 storage reservoirs in analogous geological settings.

TI  - Soil erosion in New Zealand is a net sink of CO2
AB  - Soil erosion in New Zealand exports much sediment and particulate organic carbon (POC) to the sea. The influence of this carbon export on carbon transfers between soils and the atmosphere has been largely unknown. Erosion models are used to estimate the net carbon transfer between soils and atmosphere due to soil erosion for New Zealand. The models are used to estimate the spatial distribution of erosion, which is combined with a digital map of soil organic carbon content to produce the spatial distribution of carbon erosion. The sequestration of atmospheric CO2 by regenerating soils is estimated by combining carbon recovery data with the age distribution of soils since erosion occurrence. The North Island of New Zealand is estimated to export 1Â·9 (with uncertainty of -0Â·5 and +1Â·0) million tonnes of POC per year to the sea and to sequester 1Â·25 (-0Â·3 /+0Â·6) million tonnes of carbon per year from the atmosphere through regenerating soils. The South Island of New Zealand is estimated to export 2Â·9 (-0Â·7/+1Â·5) million tonnes of POC per year and to sequester approximately the same amount. Assuming exported carbon is buried at sea with an efficiency of 80% gives New Zealand a net carbon sink of 3Â·1 (-2Â·0/+2Â·5) million tonnes per year; which is equivalent to 45% of New Zealand's fossil fuel carbon emissions in 1990. The net sink primarily results from a conveyor belt transfer of carbon from the atmosphere to soils regenerating from erosion to the sea floor where carbon is permanently buried. The net sink due to soil erosion can be further increased by reforestation of those terrains where erosion is excessive and there is no carbon recovery in the soils.

TI  - EXERGY ANALYSIS OF COAL ENERGY CONVERSION WITH CARBON SEQUESTRATION VIA COMBUSTION IN SUPERCRITICAL SALINE AQUIFER WATER
AB  - Decarbonization of electricity production is a vital component in meeting stringent emissions targets aimed at curbing the effects of global climate change. Most projected pathways toward meeting those targets include a large contribution from carbon capture and storage. Many capture technologies impose a large energy penalty to separate and compress carbon dioxide (CO2). Also, injected neat CO2 in a deep saline aquifer is buoyant compared to the aquifer brine and requires an impermeable seal to prevent it from escaping the aquifer. An alternative technology was recently proposed by Heber le and Edwards {[}1] that burns coal in supercritical water pumped from a saline aquifer. The entire effluent stream is sequestered, capturing all carbon and non-mineral coal combustion products in the process. This stream is denser than the aquifer brine and therefore offers a higher level of storage security, and can utilize aquifers without suitable structural trapping. This technology also increases energy security in the U.S., allowing for the use of its coal resources while avoiding atmospheric pollution. In this paper, a complete architecture employing supercritical water oxidation is proposed, including a liquid-oxygen-pumped air separation unit and regenerator system that heats and desalinates the incoming brine. A thermodynamic model calculates the overall thermal efficiency of the plant, including all separation and storage energy penalties. In addition, an exergy analysis gives insights into the least efficient parts of the proposed system. The details and assumptions of the model are discussed. Insights from the model and these analyses elucidate how the proposed system may be operated as a zero-emission electricity source and the technical challenges that must be addressed for deployment.

TI  - Continental-scale plant invasions reshuffle the soil microbiome of blue carbon ecosystems
AB  - Theory and experiments support that plant invasions largely impact aboveground biodiversity and function. Yet, much less is known on the influence of plant invasions on the structure and function of the soil microbiome of coastal wetlands, one of the largest major reservoirs of biodiversity and carbon on Earth. We studied the continental-scale invasion of Spartina alterniflora across 2451 km of Chinese coastlines as our model-system and found that S. alterniflora invasion can largely influence the soil microbiome (across six depths from 0 to 100 cm), compared with the most common microhabitat found before invasion (mudflats, Mud). In detail, S. alterniflora invasion was not only positively associated with bacterial richness but also resulted in important biotic homogenization of bacterial communities, suggesting that plant invasion can lead to important continental scale trade-offs in the soil microbiome. We found that plant invasion changed the community composition of soil bacterial communities across the soil profile. Moreover, the bacterial communities associated with S. alterniflora invasions where less responsive to climatic changes than those in native Mud microhabitats, suggesting that these new microbial communities might become more dominant under climate change. Plant invasion also resulted in important reductions in the complexity and stability of microbial networks, decoupling the associations between microbes and carbon pools. Taken together, our results indicated that plant invasions can largely influence the microbiome of coastal wetlands at the scale of China, representing the first continental-scale example on how plant invasions can reshuffle the soil microbiome, with consequences for the myriad of functions that they support.

TI  - Are mangroves drivers or buffers of coastal acidification? Insights from alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon export estimates across a latitudinal transect
AB  - Mangrove forests are hot spots in the global carbon cycle, yet the fate for a majority of mangrove net primary production remains unaccounted for. The relative proportions of alkalinity and dissolved CO2 [CO2*] within the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) exported from mangroves is unknown, and therefore, the effect of mangrove DIC exports on coastal acidification remains unconstrained. Here we measured dissolved inorganic carbon parameters over complete tidal and diel cycles in six pristine mangrove tidal creeks covering a 26Â° latitudinal gradient in Australia and calculated the exchange of DIC, alkalinity, and [CO2*] between mangroves and the coastal ocean. We found a mean DIC export of 59 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1 across the six systems, ranging from import of 97 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1 to an export of 85 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1. If the Australian transect is representative of global mangroves, upscaling our estimates would result in global DIC exports of 3.6 Â± 1.1 Tmol C yrâˆ’1, which accounts for approximately one third of the previously unaccounted for mangrove carbon sink. Alkalinity exchange ranged between an import of 1.2 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1 and an export of 117 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1 with an estimated global export of 4.2 Â± 1.3 Tmol yrâˆ’1. A net import of free CO2 was estimated (âˆ’11.4 Â± 14.8 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1) and was equivalent to approximately one third of the air-water CO2 flux (33.1 Â± 6.3 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1). Overall, the effect of DIC and alkalinity exports created a measurable localized increase in coastal ocean pH. Therefore, mangroves may partially counteract coastal acidification in adjacent tropical waters. Â©2016. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Experimental investigations on the effect of CO2 on mechanics of coal
AB  - To mitigate the adverse effects of greenhouse gases on global climate, several options have been proposed. One of the main options is to reduce gas emissions by the storage of CO2 in deep underground formations. Coal seams are of interest owing to their naturally stored methane which can be produced during sequestration and thereby partially offset the costs. However, there are some concerns about the practicality of using coal seams for carbon dioxide storage due to insufficient understanding of the associated physical and chemical processes. In order to develop an efficient strategy for coal seam sequestration, variables that affect the transport and mechanical properties need to be investigated. In this paper the results of a series of experimental investigations are reported, which have been conducted to enhance our understanding of the effects of CO2 adsorption on the mechanical properties of coal. The experimental results show that the adsorption of CO2 changes the elastic modulus and the strength of coal samples, and that these effects are reversible. Simple models are described that have been developed to represent the adsorption-induced changes on the mechanical properties of coal. SEM images suggest that the coal microstructure may also change in the presence of CO2. The adsorption-induced changes in the elastic modulus, strength, and microstructure of coal are believed to be similar to the effects of plasticisers on polymers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Identification of potential hazardous events of unloading system and Co2 storage tanks of an intermediate storage terminal for the Korea clean carbon storage project 2025
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is regarded as one of key technologies to meet global greenhouse gas emission reduction goal. In this manner, South Korea is developing a one-million-Ton-scale offshore CCS project to reduce national greenhouse gas emission, entitled the Korea Clean Carbon Storage Project (KCCS) 2025. In this project, the CO2 is captured from power plants on coast, loaded to CO2 carriers, and transported to an intermediate storage terminal, which is located on shoreline nearby offshore storage reservoirs at the Ulleung Basin. Then the CO2 is exported via an offshore pipeline to offshore platform for injection to geological storage site for a permanent containment. Since the concept of the KCCS 2025 includes CO2 carriers as a transportation method, it requires an intermediate storage terminal that receives the CO2 from carrier and send out continuous CO2 flow to the offshore pipeline after the pressurization of CO2 to higher than 100 bar. The intermediate storage terminal will consist of (1) unloading system, (2) CO2 storage tanks, (3) LP pumps, (4) a reliquefaction package, (5) a vent stack and (6) HP pump and injection pump (a booster station). Because there are few actual projects with an intermediate storage terminal worldwide, researches on intermediate storage facilities are insufficient. To support an optimal concept design of the intermediate storage terminal for the KCCS 2025, this study identified the potential hazardous events for the unloading system and the CO2 storage tanks. For the unloading system, an unloading arm and LCO2 recirculating line are found to be major components causing serious damage in case of accident. In the case of the CO2 storage tanks, where large amounts of CO2 are stored, they can cause serious damage due to large amounts of CO2 leakage when the tanks are ruptured, over-pressurized, low-pressurized, overcharged, etc. Because hazardous events may pose significant harm to humans or the environment, these results should be considered in the next phases of the project. The results of this study can be helpful for the development of safe CO2 transportation technology in the future. Â© 2018 WIT Press.

TI  - Effectiveness of CO2 sequestration in the post-industrial ocean
AB  - Sequestration of CO2 in the post-industrial ocean, beginning in the year 2000, is compared to sequestration in the pre-industrial ocean. We employ a carbon cycle model that is based on an ocean general circulation model. More of the sequestered CO2 is returned to the atmosphere in the post-industrial case, but the large differences depending on location still hold. The predictions probably become unrealistic after a few hundred years because the model does not yet include the dissolution of calcium carbonate sediments. funding_textÂ 1={ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors wish to thank the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Energy Laboratory and Science Applications International Corporation for providing support of this study.

TI  - Summer fluxes of atmospheric greenhouse gases N2O, CH4 and CO2 from mangrove soil in South China
AB  - The atmospheric fluxes of N2O, CH4 and CO2 from the soil in four mangrove swamps in Shenzhen and Hong Kong. South China were investigated in the summer of 2008 The fluxes ranged from 0.14 to 23.83 mu mol m(-2) h(-1), 11 9 to 5168.6 fund m(-2) h(-1) and 0 69 to 20 56 mmol m(-2) h(-1) for N2O, CH4 and CO2, respectively Futian mangrove swamp in Shenzhen had the highest greenhouse gas fluxes, followed by Mai Po mangrove in Hong Kong. Sha Kong Tsuen and Yung Shue O mangroves in Hong Kong had similar, low fluxes. The differences in both N2O and CH4 fluxes among different tidal positions, the landward, seaward and bare mudflat, in each swamp were insignificant. The N2O and CO2 fluxes were positively correlated with the soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphate, total iron and NH4+-N contents, as well as the soil porosity. However, only soil NH4+-N concentration had significant effects on CH4 fluxes (C) 2010 Elsevier B V. All rights reserved

TI  - Study the CO2 injection and sequestration in depleted M4 carbonate gas condensate reservoir, Malaysia
AB  - M4 carbonate field, a depleted gas field located offshore Sarawak, has been identified as potential candidate for CO2 sequestration site in conjunction with another high CO2 field development and commercialization efforts. The field has undergone a feasibility study to evaluate potential geomechanical issues associated with CO2 injection. A detail 3D simulation analysis was conducted to quantify the effective storage capacity in M4 field, identify the optimum CO2 injection scheme and evaluate the trapping mechanism in M4 field. Reservoir geomechanical study was also performed for M4 field to evaluate the associated geomechanical issues pre, during and post CO2 injection to assure a safe and long term CO2 sequestration in the field. First, the available field history matched black oil simulation model was successfully converted to compositional 3D model, in which CO2 is treated and can be tracked as a separate component in the reservoir throughout the production and injection processes. A detail study has then been conducted to understand the containment and analyze the effective CO2 trapping mechanisms. Different types of trapping mechanisms including the hydrodynamic trapping, residual or capillary trapping, solubility trapping, and mineral trapping have been studied in detail. Hysteresis effect on CO2 sequestration and different trapping mechanism during and post CO2 injection has been also studied. In addition, various CO2 injection schemes have been also conducted to optimize the injection rate, sustainability, capacity, location, number of the wells and favorable trapping mechanism for long term sequestration. The study covered 20 years of gas production history and forecast followed by 10 years of CO2 injection in the selected optimum scheme and then monitoring part more than for 100 years after injection to assure the safe sequestration and potential CO2 leakage. Constraining to the initial reservoir pressure to assure cap rock integrity and potential leakages, the study showed that the field has potential to store and sequestrate CO2 up to 40% bigger standard volume than gas initially in place (GIIP).

TI  - Will restored mangrove forests enhance sediment organic carbon and ecosystem carbon storage?
AB  - Mangrove forests are among the largest carbon (C) sinks in (sub) tropical areas, playing a vital role in reducing C emissions. However, these forests have degraded rapidly in recent decades due to various human activities and natural disturbances. Thus, mangrove restoration programs have been widely initiated to prevent further forest loss and to mitigate climate change. The measurement of ecosystem C storage in restored mangrove forests will provide crucial information for the temporal reporting of C emissions in reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) schemes. The question whether restored mangrove forests enhance sediment organic carbon (OC) and ecosystem C storage has not been resolved for mangrove restoration programs. The present study, therefore, aimed to quantify ecosystem C storage and the contribution of organic matter sources to sedimentary OC in Kandelia obovata forests aged 9, 19 and 27 years; Sonneratia caseolaris forests aged 2 and 3 years, and a reference mudflat forest aged 0 from Hau Loc, North-Central Vietnam. The mean above- and below-ground C stocks of these forests ranged from 12.7 +/- 2.4 to 107.5 +/- 10.7 MgC ha(-1), and 103.8 +/- 2.9 to 412.4 +/- 6.5 MgC ha(-1), respectively. The ecosystem C storage of mangrove forests tended to increase with stand age, ranging from 201.3 +/- 4.3 to 519.9 +/- 12.5 MgC ha(-1), with an overall mean of 310.3 +/- 21.3 MgC ha(-1). The contribution of mangrove litter to sedimentary OC was between 45.8 +/- 0.8 and 64.1 +/- 1.5\% along a forest chronosequence. The increase of the OC content and ecosystem C storage, and the proportional contributions of OC sources with forest age resulted from higher biomass production following forest development and the location of stands in the intertidal zone. These findings highlighted the importance of mangrove restoration programs in enhancing the ecosystem C storage and the sediment OC. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Length of vertical pipes for deep-ocean sequestration of CO2 in rough seas
AB  - In deep-ocean sequestration of CO2, it is difficult technically and costly to transport the CO2 with the use of pipelines on the sea floor, especially when the disposal site is deep and far from land. A promising alternative is using a ship as CO2 carrier and a pipe suspended vertically from a floating base at the site. The mechanical strength of the pipe has been investigated with consideration of the static tension due to the weight of the pipe itself and buoyancy of additional floaters, as well as the dynamic tension due to wave-induced motion of the floating base. We found that a pipe length of 4,000m is a feasible extension of conventional techniques. A pipe longer than 6,000m requires development of innovative technologies that are not yet developed.

TI  - Enhancement of oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 by macro-nutrient fertilization
AB  - A global three-dimensional Ocean Carbon Cycle model was used to investigate the efficiency of macro-nutrient fertilization at enhancing the rate that anthropogenic CO2 is sequestered by the ocean (Matear, 2000). To simulate macro-nutrient fertilization, phosphate was added to the model in the 18-50degreesS region of the Southern Ocean. The carbon sequestration efficiency of fertilization is determined from the ratio between increased ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 and the rate of phosphate addition to the upper ocean (converted to carbon units using the C/P ratio of organic matter, 106). The model predicted a maximum efficiency of 90\%. However, increased calcium carbon production with macro-nutrient fertilization can significantly reduce carbon sequestration efficiency. The deeper depth scale for the dissolution of calcium carbonate than the remineralization of organic matter amplifies the importance of changes in calcium carbonate production. When calcium carbonate production increases at the same rate as export production, the carbon sequestration efficiency is reduced by 25\% in comparison to when calcium carbonate production is held constant. Ocean macro-nutrient fertilization may alter the air-sea exchange of two other important greenhouse gases, N2O and DMS. We estimate that increased N2O production in the ocean with fertilization would reduce the efficiency of fertilization by a maximum of 20\%. Changes in the air-sea exchange of DMS may also occur with ocean fertilization. Further studies are required to assess the response of marine DMS production to macro-nutrient fertilization. Climate simulations with greenhouse warming predicted dramatic changes in ocean circulation. However, the predicted ocean circulation changes did not alter the carbon sequestration efficiency of macro-nutrient fertilization.

TI  - Marine viruses and global climate change
AB  - Sea-surface warming, sea-ice melting and related freshening, changes in circulation and mixing regimes, and ocean acidification induced by the present climate changes are modifying marine ecosystem structure and function and have the potential to alter the cycling of carbon and nutrients in surface oceans. Changing climate has direct and indirect consequences on marine viruses, including cascading effects on biogeochemical cycles, food webs, and the metabolic balance of the ocean. We discuss here a range of case studies of climate change and the potential consequences on virus function, viral assemblages and virus-host interactions. In turn, marine viruses influence directly and indirectly biogeochemical cycles, carbon sequestration capacity of the oceans and the gas exchange between the ocean surface and the atmosphere. We cannot yet predict whether the viruses will exacerbate or attenuate the magnitude of climate changes on marine ecosystems, but we provide evidence that marine viruses interact actively with the present climate change and are a key biotic component that is able to influence the oceans' feedback on climate change. Long-term and wide spatial-scale studies, and improved knowledge of host-virus dynamics in the world's oceans will permit the incorporation of the viral component into future ocean climate models and increase the accuracy of the predictions of the climate change impacts on the function of the oceans.

TI  - Environmental Filtering by pH and Salinity Jointly Drives Prokaryotic Community Assembly in Coastal Wetland Sediments
AB  - Understanding the microbial community assembly is an essential topic in microbial ecology. Coastal wetlands are an important blue carbon sink, where microbes play a key role in biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and energy transformation. However, the drivers controlling the distribution patterns and assembly of bacterial and archaeal communities in coastal wetland are unclear. Here we examined the diversity, co-occurrence network, assembly processes and environmental drivers of bacterial and archaeal communities from inshore to offshore sediments by the sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. The value of alpha- and beta-diversity of bacterial and archaeal communities generally did not change significantly (P > 0.05) between offshore sites, but changed significantly (P < 0.05) among inshore sites. Sediment pH and salinity showed significant effects on the diversity and keystone taxa of bacterial and archaeal communities. The bacterial and archaeal co-occurrence networks were inextricably linked with pH and salinity to formed the large network nodes, suggesting that they were the key factors to drive the prokaryotic community. We also identified that heterogeneous and homogeneous selection drove the bacterial and archaeal community assembly, while the two selections became weaker from offshore sites to inshore sites, suggesting that deterministic processes were more important in offshore sites. Overall, these results suggested that the environmental filtering of pH and salinity jointly governed the assembly of prokaryotic community in offshore sediments. This study advances our understanding of microbial community assembly in coastal wetland ecosystems.

TI  - Finite element based fatigue life evaluation of anthropogenic CO 2 pipeline containing an inner defect
AB  - The great effort for reducing emissions of CO2 to atmosphere will inevitably involve the carry-out process of Carbon Capture and Storage(CCS), a novel plan which intends to capture and store anthropogenic CO2 produced at many existing industrial sources, such as power stations and petrochemical works. In particular, anthropogenic CO2 pipeline transportation from the energy plant to the remote sequestration area(both onshore and offshore) is a fundamental issue regarding the feasibility of applying the CCS technology. CO2 pipelines have been in operation in USA, Europe and North Africa for almost three decades. However, the technical challenges for pipelines transporting CO2 due to the relevant effects of different impurities coming from flue gases, are still needed to get people to take up, especially for China which is focusing on the roll-out of CCS. This paper will address a FE-based method which can assess residual life of a supercritical CO2 transmission pipeline containing an inner defect induced crack. Specifically, a portion of welded round steel pipeline is selected as the object of our analysis and an ANSYS finite element procedure is generated to simulate the stress state of an element volume along the radial direction and hence to calculate the effective stress due to the effects of crack closure. Afterwards, combining the effective stress we get in the above numeric analysis, the Paris equation is modified to build an integral analysis method for the residual life evaluation of CO2 pipeline. Lastly, in order to verify the validity of the proposed method, a pipeline example in a published paper is used as the benchmark model, the full-scale test results of which are compared with those from our method. Based on this, a section of CO2 pipeline, with an initial defect (assumed as a crack source), is analyzed and its residual life is evaluated by using the presented method. The analysis of numerical results indicates that the method presented in this paper can give us a valuable reference to life-evaluation for CO 2 pipeline in CCS. Â© (2012) Trans Tech Publications.

TI  - Isothermal splitting of CO2to CO using cobalt-ferrite redox looping
AB  - Rising atmospheric CO2 levels from significant imbalance between carbon emissions from fossil fuel utilization, especially for energy and chemicals, and natural carbon sequestration rates is known to drive-up the global temperatures and associated catastrophic climate changes, such as rising mean sea level, glacial melting, and extinction of ecosystems. Carbon capture and utilization techniques are necessary for transition from fossil fuel infrastructure to renewable energy resources to help delay the dangers of reaching to the point of positive feedback between carbon emissions and climate change which can drive terrestrial conditions to uninhabitable levels. CO2 captured from the atmosphere directly or from flue gases of a power plant can be recycled and transformed to CO and syngas for use as energy and value-added chemicals. Utilizing renewable energy resources to drive CO2 conversion to CO via thermochemical redox looping can provide a carbon negative renewable energy conversion pathway for sustainable energy production as well as valueadded products. Substituted ferrites such as Co-ferrite, Mnferrite were found to be promising materials to aid the conversion of CO2 to CO at lower reduction temperatures. Furthermore, the conversion of these materials in the presence of Al2O3 provided hercynite cycling, which further lowered the reduction temperature. In this paper, Co-ferrite and Co-ferrite-alumina prepared via co-precipitation were investigated to understand their potential as oxygen carriers for CO2 conversion under isothermal redox looping. Isothermal reduction looping provided improved feasibility in redox conversion since it avoids the need for temperature swinging which improves thermal efficiency. These efforts alleviates the energy losses in heat recovery while also reducing thermal stresses on both the materials and the reactor. Lab-scale testing was carried out at 1673 K on these materials for extended periods and multiple cycles to gain insights into cyclic performance and the feasibility of sintering, which is a common issue in iron-oxide-based oxygen carriers. Cobalt doping provided with lowering of reduction temperature requirement at the cost of oxidation thermodynamic spontaneity that required increased oxidation temperature. At the concentrations examined, these opposing phenomenon made isothermal redox operation feasible by providing high CO yields comparable to oxygen carriers in the literature, which were operated at different temperatures for reduction and oxidation. Significantly high CO yields (âˆ¼ 750 Î¼mol/g) were obtained from Co-ferrite isothermal redox looping. Co-ferrite-alumina provided lower CO yields compared to Co-ferrite. The oxygen storage was similar to those reported in the literature on isothermal H2O splitting, but with improved morphological stability at high temperature, especially compared to ferrite. This pathway of oxygen carrier development is considered suitable with further requirement in optimization for scaling of renewable CO2 conversion into valuable products. Copyright Â© 2020 ASME.

TI  - The progress in the research on carbon dioxide geological storage in China
AB  - From 2010 to 2013, China Geological Survey (CGS) launched a project "CO2 Geological Storage Potential and Suitability Assessment and Pilot-Project in China", which has promoted CO2 geological storage study in China. Based on the complex geological conditions of basins in China, the authors have established CO2 geological storage potential and suitability assessment system suitable for China, and assessed CO2 geological storage potential and suitability about the 417 land and shallow marine sedimentary basins with the area greater than 200 km2. The CCS pilot-project in Ejin Horo Banner of Ordos City within Inner Mongolia was carried out, which served as the first coal-based CCS pilot project in deep saline aquifers in China and the largest one in the world. Some scientific and technical breakthroughs in such aspects as drilling, perfusion, sampling and monitoring were achieved. The substantial progress in the basic theoretical researches such as physical chemical and biological process, simulation, environmental impact and safety risk assessment of CO2 geological storage has also been obtained.

TI  - Perspectives on the age and distribution of large wood in riparian carbon pools
AB  - Most knowledge of carbon budgets is derived from the productivity and sequestration of carbon in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Less is known of carbon stored in riparian areas associated with lakes and rivers. Case studies of the age distribution of carbon in aquatic large wood (C-lw) from two different landscapes with different drainage patterns were established using tree-ring and C-14 dating. Cumulative negative exponential distributions of the age of C-lw ranged over periods from 1000 to 9485 years. Large woody debris had mean residence times of 261 years in small oligotrophic lakes and 350-800 years in a stream reach. Large wood can reside for an order of magnitude longer in freshwater-riparian ecosystems than in comparable above-ground terrestrial ecosystems. Although riparian areas make up only a small fraction of most landscapes, they may account for a relatively larger proportion of aged C-lw than is stored above ground in terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Determination of organic carbon content and molecular biology of mud-skipper species in acidic substrate mangrove ecosystem in Cawan Island Riau, Indonesia
AB  - Mangrove trees grow in tropical and sub-tropical coastal areas, which experience inundation and dry periods during high and low tides. Mangroves have essential functions in ecological, physical, and economic aspects, also as potential carbon storage. The study aimed to explore mangrove species, the substrateâ€™s total organic carbon (TOC) and DNA of the associated mud-skippers in the Cawan island, Riau, Indonesia. The study was approached using a new paradigm where two aspects were combined: allometric equations and DNA methods. Rhizophora apiculata, Rhizophora mucronata, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Lumnitzera racemosa, Acrostichum aureum, and Nypa fruticans were six species found in the ecosystem. The dominant species is R. apiculata, which can reach a height of 15 m, much taller than in other parts of Indonesia. The mangrovesâ€™ substrate acidity ranges between 5-7, with a density range of 390-690 trees ha-1. The content of the substrate organic carbon is 6.793-16.323 tons C ha-1. The study revealed that only two species of mud-skipper survive in this specific acidic mangrove substrate: Periopthalmodon schlosseri and Parapocryptes serperaster, which was confirmed by DNA analysis. The results of this study could be beneficial for managing and conserving the mangrove ecosystem and for developing coastal ecotourism on Cawan Island and in other regions. Â© 2022, BIOFLUX SRL.

TI  - Deep seam and minesoil carbon sequestration potential of the South Wales Coalfield, UK
AB  - Combustion of coal for energy generation has been a significant contributor to increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide. It is of interest to evaluate the potential of former coalfields for mitigating these increases by carbon sequestration and to compare different options to achieving this end. Here, carbon sequestration in residual coal seams and through reclamation of spoil tips is compared, and their carbon dioxide storage potential in the South Wales Coalfield estimated. Coal seam sequestration estimates come from an established methodology and consider the total unmined coal resource below 500 m deep with potential for carbon sequestration. The most likely effective deep seam storage capacity is 104.9 Mt carbon dioxide, taking account of reservoir conditions and engineering factors. Whilst many spoil tips in South Wales have been reclaimed, the focus has not been on carbon sequestration potential. Estimates of minesoil restoration sequestration capacity were based on a survey of restored minesoil and vegetation carbon stocks, mainly on sites 20-30 years after restoration; data from this survey were then extrapolated to the coalfield as a whole. Minesoil storage is estimated at 1.5 or 2.5 Mt (+ 2.2 Mt in tree biomass) carbon dioxide based on average grassland or woodland measurements, respectively; modelled data predicted equilibrium values of 2.9 and 2.6 Mt carbon dioxide respectively in grassland or woodland minesoils. If all sites achieved close to the maximum capacity in their land use class, minesoil storage capacity would increase to 2.1 or 3.9 Mt carbon dioxide, respectively. Combining the best woodland minesoil and standing biomass values, sequestration capacity increases to 7.2 Mt carbon dioxide. The wider social, economic, environmental and regulatory constraints to achieving this sequestration for each approach are discussed. Coal seam sequestration has a much higher capacity but sequestration in mine sites is less costly and has fewer regulatory constraints. Findings indicate a significant combined potential for carbon sequestration in the South Wales Coalfield and highlight challenges in achieving this potential. On a global scale, ex-coalfield sequestration could contribute to broader efforts to mitigate emissions.

TI  - Application of three-dimensional fault stress models for assessment of fault stability for CO2 storage sites
AB  - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a key technology for a low-carbon energy future and will have an important role on the economic future of the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS). The East Irish Sea Basin (EISB) is a prospective area for CCS in the western UKCS. 3D seismic from the EISB were used in this study to characterise the fault network and potential fault reactivation risks associated with CO2 injection. Two main structural domains are present: a Northern domain with NW-SE faults, and a Southern domain with faults following a N-S orientation. The main storage sites consist of structural closures in Triassic strata of the Sherwood Sandstone Formation (SSF), overlain by alternations of mudstones and evaporites of the Triassic Mercia Mudstone Group (MMG). The closures occur predominantly at fault-bounded horsts, with adjacent grabens filled by thick sequences of the Triassic Mercia Mudstone Group (MMG). The fault framework was used to test, in 3D, the stress model published for the EISB and assess the fault reactivation risk associated with CO2 storage. Slip tendency values were pre-dominantly below 0.6, suggesting the presence of stable structures in the EISB. Under the tested conditions, faults are capable of withstanding pressure increases between 3 MPa and 10 MPa before the onset of slip. The limited fault reactivation risk suggests CCS operations are suitable prospects for the EISB. This work demonstrates the additional value gained from integration of accurately constrained fault geometries in 3D stress models.

TI  - What Is Refractory Organic Matter in the Ocean?
AB  - About 20\% of the organic carbon produced in the sunlit surface ocean is transported into the ocean's interior as dissolved, suspended and sinking particles to be mineralized and sequestered as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), sedimentary particulate organic carbon (POC) or ``refractory{''} dissolved organic carbon (rDOC). Recently, the physical and biological mechanisms associated with the particle pumps have been revisited, suggesting that accepted fluxes might be severely underestimated (Boyd et al., 2019; Buesseler et al., 2020). Perhaps even more poorly understood are the mechanisms driving rDOC production and its potential accumulation in the ocean. On the basis of recent conflicting evidence about the relevance of DOC degradation in the deep ocean, we revisit the concept of rDOC in terms of its ``refractory{'' nature in order to understand its role in the global carbon cycle. Here, we address the problem of various definitions and approaches used to characterize rDOC (such as turnover time in relation to the ocean transit time, molecule abundance, chemical composition and structure). We propose that rDOC should be operationally defined. However, we recognize there are multiple ways to operationally define rDOC; thus the main focus for unifying future studies should be to explicitly state how rDOC is being defined and the analytical window used for measuring rDOC, rather than adhering to a single operational definition. We also conclude, based on recent evidence, that the persistence of rDOC is fundamentally dependent on both intrinsic (chemical composition and structure, e.g., molecular properties), and extrinsic properties (amount or external factors, e.g., molecular concentrations, ecosystem properties). Finally, we suggest specific research questions aimed at stimulating research on the nature, dynamics, and role of rDOC in Carbon sequestration now and in future scenarios of climate change.

TI  - Effect of CO2 phase on its water displacements in a sandstone core sample
AB  - CO2 injection into underground formations can reduce CO2 emissions, enhance hydrocarbon and methane recovery, and extract geothermal heat. As the pressure and temperature vary in subsurface formations, the injected CO2 can be in gas, liquid and supercritical phase. The change in CO2 phase is likely to have a significant impact on capillary and viscous forces, which, in turn, will have a considerable influence on injectivity, displacement, migration, storage capacity and integrity of CO2 processes. This study was designed to investigate the effect of CO2 phase, at different injection rates, on the dynamic pressure evolution and the CO2 displacement performance during CO2 injection into a water-saturated sandstone core sample. The results indicate that CO2 phase significantly affects the differential pressure profile and water production profile. The differential pressure profiles measured from the displacement of supercritical CO2 and gas CO2 were significantly different from those measured from liquidCO2 displacements, particularly before CO2 breakthrough. Gas and supercriticalCO2 injection gave a water production rate much higher than the CO2 injection rate at early stages. Liquid CO2 injection yielded a water production rate similar to the CO2 injection rate. This may indicate that the injection of ScCO2or GCO2 (under a pressure higher than 60 bar) could give a high and quick oil production rate. The highest water recovery was obtained after the injection of 0.85, 1.08 and 2.32 pore volumes of scCO2, gCO2 and LCO2, respectively. The residual water saturations for the three CO2 phases were in the range of 30â€“33% while the endpoint relative permeability was in the range of 18â€“21%. The endpoint relative permeabilities for gas and liquid CO2 were very similar and higher than that of supercritical CO2 under our experimental conditions. The increase in injection rate caused a slight increase in the endpoint relative permeabilities for the three CO2 phases. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Modeling the contribution of dissolved organic carbon to carbon sequestration during the last glacial maximum
AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a carbon reservoir that is as large as the atmospheric CO2 pool, and its contribution to the global carbon cycle is gaining attention. As DOC is a dissolved tracer, its distribution can serve to trace the mixing of water masses and the pathways of ocean circulation. Published proxy and model reconstructions have revealed that, during the last glacial maximum (LGM), the pattern of deep ocean circulation differed from that of the modern ocean, whereby additional carbon is assumed to have been sequestered in stratified LGM deep water. The aim of this study is to explore the distribution of DOC and its production/removal rate during the LGM using the Grid ENabled Integrated Earth system model (GENIE). Modeled results reveal that increased salinity of bottom waters in the Southern Ocean is associated with stronger stratification and oxygen depletion. The stratified LGM deep ocean traps more nutrients, resulting in a decrease in the DOC reservoir size that, in turn, causes a negative feedback for carbon sequestration. This finding requires an increase in DOC lifetime to compensate for the negative feedback. The upper limit of DOC lifetime is assumed to be 20,000 years. Modeled results derive an increase (decrease) in DOC reservoir by 100 Pg C leading to an atmospheric CO2 decrease (increase) of 9.1 ppm and a dissolved inorganic carbon delta C-13 increase (decrease) of 0.06aEuro degrees. The DOC removal rate is estimated to be 39.5 Tg C year(-1) in the deep sea during the LGM. The contribution of DOC to the LGM carbon cycle elucidates potential carbon sink-increasing strategies.

TI  - Carbon Biomass Algorithms Development for Mangrove Vegetation in Kemujan, Parang Island Karimunjawa National Park and Demak Coastal Area - Indonesia
AB  - The increase and accumulation of greenhouse gases such as CO2 was believed had caused global warming. Effort to decrease accumulation these gases is by increasing the role of mangrove forests with its ecological function as carbon sinks through good management system. To this date, very limited study on the mangrove carbon biomass using satellite data espescially in tropical region. Purpose of the research were to calculate the carbon biomass of mangrove vegetation above ground through allometric equations, and to build spatial model algorithms of each mangrove species in the region by remote sensing technology using Quickbird, Geo Eye and ALOS satellite data. The research use an exploratory field survey and purposive sampling method and was performed through the measurement of trunk diameter (DBH) of above ground mangrove biomass without damaging vegetation (non-destructive sampling). About 21 mangrove species in Kemujan Island with total mangrove biomass above ground consist of the trunk, branches, leaves : 182.4 ton or 91.2 tons of Carbon, with largest carbon storage in the trunk. The results of spatial algorithms mangrove carbon biomass for Kemujan island using Quickbird data are Ceriops tagal with Y = -0.003(B2/B3)(2) + 0.267(B2/B3) - 3.452; Rhizophora apiculata with the algorithm Y = 0.001(B2/B3)(2) - 0.116(B2/B3) + 3.415; Bruguiera cylindrical with the algorithm Y = -0.003(B2/B3)(2) + 0.336(B2/B3) - 7.265; Xylocarpus granatum with algorithm Y = 0.000(B2/B3)(2) - 0.058(B2/B3) + 2.101; Rhizophora mucronata with the algorithm Y = 0.000(B2/B3)(2) - 0.022(B2/B3) + 1.941. Mangrove carbon biomass algorithm using Geo Eye satellite data at Parang island for Rhizophora mucronata Y = -0.0436(B2/B3)(2) + 0.526 (B2/B3) - 1.4642; Bruguiera gymnorrhiza Y = -0.0027 (B2/B3)(2) + 0.0649 (B2/B3) - 0.2432 and Bruguiera cylindrical Y = -0.0089 (B2/B3)(2) + 0.0632 (B2/B3) - 0.0683. Total mangrove carbon biomass at Demak coastal area range from 2.9 - 44.74 ton. Algorithm of mangrove carbon biomass at Demak using ALOS-AVNIR satellite data for Avicennia marina was Y = -79.18 ((B1-B2)/(B1+ B2))(2) + 31.35 ((B1-B2)/(B1+ B2)) - 1.191. The research concluded that band rationing of Band-2 with Band-3 for Quickbird and GeoEye data and Band-1 with Band-2 for ALOS data as the spectral signature of mangrove chlorophyll pigment with wave length of 0.5 - 0.6 mu m as the best for mangrove carbon algorithms.

TI  - Evaluation of the CO 2 sequestration capacity for coal fly ash using a flow-through column reactor under ambient conditions
AB  - An in-situ CO 2 sequestration method using coal ash ponds located in coastal regions is proposed. The CO 2 sequestration capacity of coal fly ash (CFA) by mineral carbonation was evaluated in a flow-through column reactor under various conditions (solid dosage: 100-330g/L, CO 2 flow rate: 20-80mL/min, solvent type: deionized (DI) water, 1M NH 4Cl solution, and seawater). The CO 2 sequestration tests were conducted on CFA slurries using flow-through column reactors to simulate more realistic flow-through conditions. The CO 2 sequestration capacity increased when the solid dosage was increased, whereas it was affected insignificantly by the CO 2 flow rate. A 1M NH 4Cl solution was the most effective solvent, but it was not significantly different from DI water or seawater. The CO 2 sequestration capacity of CFA under the flow-through conditions was approximately 0.019g CO 2/g CFA under the test conditions (solid dosage: 333g/L, CO 2 flow rate: 40mL/min, and solvent: seawater).

TI  - Geological storage of CO2â€“N2â€“O2 mixtures produced by membrane-based direct air capture (DAC)
AB  - Carbon capture and storage has been considered as a realistic approach to reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. However, the cost of capturing high-purity CO2 typically used for geological storage (e.g., 98%) is high. Direct air capture (DAC), a technology that extracts CO2 of relatively low-purity from the ambient atmosphere, has been recently proposed as a means to achieve negative CO2 emissions when the product is sequestered underground. Although the CO2 produced by DAC is of low-purity, the other gaseous components (mainly nitrogen and oxygen) are not hazardous materials like NOx and SOx that must be typically dealt with by conventional projects in coal-burning plants. Here, we evaluate geological storage of the low-purity CO2 captured via advanced membrane-based DAC technology. The ubiquity of ambient air is important in reducing transport costs and ensuring social acceptance as the CO2 product can be both produced and stored at sites in remote areas, such as deserts and offshore platforms. We calculated the density of CO2â€“N2â€“O2 mixtures via molecular dynamics simulation and evaluated the cost of the low-purity CO2 storage. Our evaluation suggests that the storage of low-purity CO2 in geological formations is environmentally acceptable and economically viable. Â© 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Pore-lining phases and capillary breakthrough pressure of mudstone caprocks: Sealing efficiency of geologic CO2 storage sites
AB  - Subsurface containment of CO2 requires an effective caprock seal. Many previous studies on seals have relied on macroscopic measurements of capillary breakthrough pressure and other petrophysical properties without direct examination of solid phases that line pore networks and contact fluids. However, pore-lining phases strongly contribute to sealing behavior through interfacial interactions among CO2, brine, and the mineral or non-mineral phases. We examined continental and marine mudstones using high resolution (i.e., sub-micron), direct observations of pore-lining phases and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Our results indicate that sealing efficiency (i.e., breakthrough pressure) is governed by pore shapes and pore-lining phases that are not identifiable except through direct characterization of pores. Bulk XRD data do not indicate which phases line the pores and may be especially lacking for mudstones with organic material. Organics can line pores and may represent once-mobile organics that modified wettability of an originally clay-lined pore network. For shallow formations (i.e., &lt;800m depth), interfacial tension and contact angles result in breakthrough pressures that may be as high as those needed to fracture the rock-thus, in the absence of fractures, high capillary sealing efficiency is indicated. Deeper seals have poorer capillary sealing if some reduction in water-wetting occurs, with an increase in pressure and temperature, on minerals and/or pore-lining organic phases.

TI  - Sensitivity of 21st Century Ocean Carbon Export Flux Projections to the Choice of Export Depth Horizon
AB  - Global Earth system model simulations of ocean carbon export flux are commonly interpreted only at a fixed depth horizon of 100 m, despite the fact that the maximum annual mixed layer depth (MLDmax) is a more appropriate depth horizon to evaluate export-driven carbon sequestration. We compare particulate organic carbon (POC) flux and export efficiency (e-ratio) evaluated at both the MLDmax and 100-m depth horizons, simulated for the 21st century (2005-2100) under the RCP8.5 climate change scenario with the Biogeochemical Elemental Cycle model embedded in the Community Earth System Model (CESM1-BEC). These two depth horizon choices produce differing baseline global rates and spatial patterns of POC flux and e-ratio, with the greatest discrepancies found in regions with deep winter mixing. Over the 21st century, enhanced stratification reduces the depth of MLDmax, with the most pronounced reductions in regions that currently experience the deepest winter mixing. Simulated global mean decreases in POC flux and in e-ratio over the 21st century are similar for both depth horizons (8\%-9\% for POC flux and 4\%-6\% for e-ratio), yet the spatial patterns of change are quite different. The model simulates less pronounced decreases and even increases in POC flux and e-ratio in deep winter mixing regions when evaluated at MLDmax, since enhanced stratification over the 21st century shoals the depth of this horizon. The differing spatial patterns of change across these two depth horizons demonstrate the importance of including multiple export depth horizons in observational and modeling efforts to monitor and predict potential future changes to export.

TI  - CO2 for ocean disposal research
AB  - Closed single cycle O-2/CO2 combustion integrated with a unified cleaning system is proposed to produce a continuous supply of carbon dioxide for deep-sea sequestering research on the Island of Hawaii. It has been suggested that the quantity needed for injection might be about 100 tons per day, compressed to the appropriate pressure and then transported by a pipeline to an ocean depth of 2,000 feet or more and dispersed. This research project is so far only partly defined but likely will be run for a period of years, perhaps five or ten years or longer, in order to assure the viability of this method of CO2 disposal. The closed cycle plant with its required cryogenic air separation unit (ASU) can produce an approximately 98\% CO2 exhaust gas byproduct, likely suitable far ocean disposal research without further processing, while producing electric power for distribution. A range of liquefied gases might also be recovered for export. This would be the first commercial scale demonstration of the O-2/CO2 combustion method with a projected net plant thermal efficiency improvement, so far as is known.

AB  - Kelp forests are the largest vegetated marine ecosystem on earth, but vast areas of their distribution remain unmapped and unmonitored. Efficient and cost-effective methods for measuring the standing biomass of these ecosystems are urgently needed for coastal mapping, ocean accounting and sustainable management of wild harvest. Here we show how widely available acoustic equipment on vessels can be used to perform robust and large-scale (kilometer) quantifications of kelp biomass which can be used in assessments and monitoring programs. We demonstrate how to interpret echograms from acoustic systems into point estimates of standing biomass in order to create spatial maps of biomass distribution. We also explore what environmental conditions are suitable for acoustic measures. This has direct application for blue carbon accounting, coastal monitoring, management of wild seaweed harvest and the protection and conservation of marine habitats supporting high biodiversity.

TI  - Economical carbon dioxide recovery for sequestration from a solid oxide fuel cell power plant
AB  - A new technology has been developed that allows generation of electricity from natural gas or other hydrogen-rich fuels without emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It involves tubular solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC) in an integrated carbon dioxide recovery configuration that uses a solid-state afterburner to complete the oxidation of the fuel without introducing air into the exhaust stream. These types of fuel cells exhaust high purity CO(2) that could be disposed of by injection into the subsurface at costs that are below that of alternative carbon dioxide abatement technologies. The hew technology will be demonstrated with 250 kWe power plant at a coastal site in Norway that is located adjacent to a fish farm. In addition to power and heat the fish farm will utilize the CO(2) produced by the demonstration plant As a nutrient for the algae upon which the fish feed.

TI  - Sequestering seawater on land: A water-based solution to global issues [version 1; referees: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]
AB  - The 'surplus' of oceanic water generated by climate change offers an unprecedented opportunity to tackle a number of global issues through a very pragmatic process: shifting the excess water from the oceans onto the land. Here we propose that sea-level rise could be mitigated through the desalination of very large amounts of seawater in massive desalination plants. To efficiently mitigate sea-level rise, desalinized water could be stored on land in the form of crop, wetlands or new forests. Based on a US$ 500 million price to build an individual mega desalination plant with current technology, the cost of controlling current sea-level rise through water desalination approaches US$ 23 trillion. However, the economic, environmental and health benefits would also be immense and could contribute to addressing a number of global issues including sea-level rise, food security, biodiversity loss and climate change. Because these issues are intimately intertwined, responses should aim at addressing them all concurrently and at global scale. Â© 2016 Boyer S and Lefort MC.

TI  - Process integration approaches to optimal planning of unconventional gas field development
AB  - In recent years, the oil and gas industry has been moving to develop unconventional gas fields, which include those contaminated with high carbon dioxide (CO2) content. Typically, the CO2 has to be separated from the natural gas (NG) in offshore processing facilities (in situ) before the NG can be sent for processing at the gas plant onshore. To date, commercial-scale CO2 capture and storage (CCS) has proven to be viable mainly for CO2 that is separated from NG and subsequently injected at or near the gas field itself for permanent storage (CO2 sequestration) or utilized for the purpose of Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). In the case of multiple adjacent reservoirs exhibiting variations in NG quality and CO2 content, it may be necessary to have in situ CO2 removal using NG sweetening processes (e.g. membrane or amine absorption) to achieve a quality level such that the pooled NG streams meets the sales gas specification required for further processing at an onshore facility for sales. In this work, new process integration approaches are proposed to aid in the integrated planning of such joint field development projects, to rationalize the development of contaminated gas fields together with conventional sweet gas fields in meeting the required sales gas specifications of CO2 content. These approaches are based on analogous techniques previously developed for distributed effluent treatment systems and carbon capture planning for the power generation sector. A case study is used to illustrate how general insight-based policies for gas field development can be drawn from process integration perspectives. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Though the timeframe of carbon recovery for ecosystems such as peatlands, mangroves and old-growth forests is shorter (centuries), this timeframe still exceeds the time we have remaining to avoid the worst impacts of global warming. There are some natural places that we cannot afford to lose due to their irreplaceable carbon reserves. Here we map `irrecoverable carbon' globally to identify ecosystem carbon that remains within human purview to manage and, if lost, could not be recovered by mid-century, by when we need to reach net-zero emissions to avoid the worst climate impacts. Since 2010, agriculture, logging and wildfire have caused emissions of at least 4.0 Gt of irrecoverable carbon. The world's remaining 139.1 +/- 443.6 Gt of irrecoverable carbon faces risks from land-use conversion and climate change. These risks can be reduced through proactive protection and adaptive management. Currently, 23.0\% of irrecoverable carbon is within protected areas and 33.6\% is managed by Indigenous peoples and local communities. Half of Earth's irrecoverable carbon is concentrated on just 3.3\% of its land, highlighting opportunities for targeted efforts to increase global climate security. Avoiding catastrophic climate change requires that we avoid losing key natural carbon reserves. This study maps such irrecoverable carbon globally and finds a third of the remaining managed by Indigenous peoples and local communities and nearly a quarter in protected areas.

TI  - Numerical simulation of dilution process in CO2 ocean sequestration
AB  - In order to investigate biological impacts caused by ocean sequestration of carbon dioxide, we have been elucidating dilution processes of CO2 in the vicinity of injection points in the deep ocean from a fluid-dynamical point of view. A CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) method for two-phase flow with mass and heat transfer has been developed for analysing CO2 droplet plume at the middle depth. Its results suggest particular dynamics of plume of rising and dissolving droplets and predict that such impacts can be insignificant in terms of individual mortality depending on the rate and period of injection.

TI  - Sediment Trapping and Carbon Sequestration in Floodplains of the Lower Atchafalaya Basin, LA: Allochthonous Versus Autochthonous Carbon Sources
AB  - Recent studies suggest that about 2Pg of organic C is stored on floodplains worldwide. The present study indicates the Atchafalaya River, fifth largest river in the United States in terms of discharge, traps 30mm/year of sediment on average within its floodplain, which is the highest average nonepisodic rate of fluvial deposition on the U.S. Coastal Plain. We installed sediment sampling stations at 23 sites, normally in transect, in the Atchafalaya Basin; these sites represent the range of hydrogeomorphic conditions on the floodplain based on hydrologic connectivity with the river main stem. The rate of sedimentation translates into about 12.5Tg/year and includes 694Mg/year of organic C. Highest sedimentation rates are associated with areas of high connectivity to channels and prograding deltaic processes. The C-13 content suggests that 35\% of deposited C is derived from river-suspended sediment compared to litterfall in the basin. Thus, much of the organic C sequestered is allochthonous material. However, isolated interior sites with limited connectivity to the channel may generate and sequester large amounts of autochthonous C. The substantial trapping of both autochthonous and allochthonous C (392Mg/year) make this freshwater-forested floodplain critical in storage of material before reaching the coastal delta and estuary. This C deposition rate (340g C.m(-2).yr(-1)) exceeds all other rates reported in recent Blue Carbon and Tidal Freshwater Forested Wetland studies. Atchafalaya C sequestration occurs in/near areas with tidal influence and like other coastal systems is an important site for trapping mineral and organic sediment and in global C cycling.

TI  - Quantification of soil organic carbon storage and turnover in two mangrove forests using dual carbon isotopic measurements
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are highly productive and play an important role in tropical and global coastal carbon (C) budgets. However, soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and turnover in mangrove forests are still poorly understood. Based on C and C isotopic measurements of soil cores from two natural mangrove forests in Southern China, SOC density was 674.41 Mg ha-1 in one forest (site 1, a Aegiceras corniculatum-dominated high tidal flat) Aegiceras corniculatum Mangroves Aegiceras corniculatum site (site 1) and 372.83 Mg ha-1 in the other forest (site 2, a Bruguiera gymnorrhiza + Kandelia candel-dominated middle tidal flat). SOC storage in the upper 100 cm in mangrove forests in China was estimated to be 13.65-24.68 Tg. SOC Î´13X values in the two mangrove forests ranged from -29.36 to -25.90â€°. SOC Î´13C was enriched with depth at 20-70 cm at site 1 (which is similar to the trend in most terrestrial ecosystems) but not at site 2, probably because the latter but not the former forest experienced frequent tidal flushing of the surface soil. SOC Î´13C enrichment with depth at site 1 was not due to depletion of Î´13C of atmospheric CO2 by fossil fuel emissions or to the difference between root and leaf 13C, but possibly resulted from preferential microbial decomposition; this inference was supported by the Rayleigh distillation model, which also indicated that C was mainly from the parent A. corniculatum forest. C and stable C isotopic measurements indicated that tidal fluctuation greatly impacted SOC deposition in these mangrove forests; the high tidal flat (site 1) and the middle tidal flat (site 2) showed terrestrial and oceanic deposition characteristics, respectively. 14C from the testing of thermonuclear weapons had penetrated to 50-60 cm in the two forests. SOC turnover time varied with depth. The surface SOC turnover time at both sites was about 0.5 year, because most surface SOC consisted of easily decomposed litter. SOC turnover time at 20-60 cm at site 1 and at 25-50 cm at site 2 was 4.44-26.04 year. Abundant roots apparently accounted for the short SOC turnover times at these middle soil layers.

TI  - An approach for assessing engineering risk from shale gas wells in the United States
AB  - In response to a series of "energy crises" in the 1970s, the United States government began investigating the potential of unconventional, domestic sources of energy to offset imported oil. Hydraulic fracturing applied to vertical tight sand and coal bed methane wells achieved some degree of success during a period of high energy prices in the early 1980s, but shale gas remained largely untapped until the late 1990s with the application of directional drilling, a mature technology adapted from deepwater offshore platforms that allowed horizontal wells to penetrate kilometers of organic-rich shale, and staged hydraulic fracturing, which created high permeability flowpaths from the horizontal wells into a much greater volume of the target formations than previous completion methods.These new engineering techniques opened up vast unconventional natural gas and oil reserves, but also raised concerns about potential environmental impacts. These include short-term and long-term impacts to air and water quality from rig operations, potential migration of gas, fluids and chemicals through the ground, and effects on small watersheds and landscapes from roads, pads and other surface structures.Engineering risk assessment commonly uses integrated assessment models (IAMs), which define sources of risk from features, events and processes. The risk from each system element is assessed using high-fidelity models. Output from these is simplified into reduced-order models, so that a large, integrated site performance assessment can be run using the IAM. The technique has been applied to engineered systems in geologic settings for sequestering carbon dioxide, and it is also applicable to shale gas, albeit with some modifications of the various system elements.Preliminary findings indicate that shale gas well drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques are generally safe when properly applied. Incident reports recorded by state environmental agencies suggest that human error resulting from the disregard of prescribed practices is the greatest cause of environmental incidents. This can only be addressed through education, regulations and enforcement. Â© 2014 .

TI  - Biodegradation of Enteromorpha prolifera by mangrove degrading micro-community with physical-chemical pretreatment
AB  - The bacteria involved in the biodegradation of Enteromorpha prolifera (EP) are largely unknown, especially in offshore mangrove environments. In order to obtain the bacterial EP-degrading communities, sediments from a typical mangrove forest were sampled on the roots of mangrove in Dongzhai Port (Haikou, China). The sediments were enriched with crude EP powders as the sole carbon source. The bacterial composition of the resulting mangrove-degrading micro-community (MDMC), named D2-1, was analysed. With methods of plate cultivation and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16S rRNA library analysis, 18 bacteria belonging to nine genera were detected from this community. Among these detected bacteria, five major bands closely related to Bacillus, Marinobacter, Paenibacillus, Photobacterium, and Zhouia were determined. A novel two-step pretreatment for EP was proposed to lower the severity requirement of biodegraded pretreatment time. It consisted of a mild physical or chemical step (ultrasonic or H2O2) and a subsequent biological treatment with community D2-1. The combined treatment led to significant increases in the EP degradation. After combined treatment, the net yields of total soluble sugars and reducing sugars increased. The combined pretreatment of H2O2 (2\%, 48 h) and MDMC (7 days) was more effective than the treatment of MDMC only for 15 days. It could remarkably shorten the residence time and reduce the losses of carbohydrates.

TI  - Quantifying gross primary productivity of an Indian mangrove forest using GEO-LEO satellite data
AB  - Gross primary productivity (GPP) is total carbon assimilation by plants through the process of photosynthesis. In view of increasing anthropogenic influences and global changes, quantification of carbon assimilation through photosynthesis has gained tremendous significance. Precise estimation of GPP is essential part of several ecosystem models. Mangrove ecosystem, that offers significant protection to coastal environment, is governed by changes in salinity and other micro-environment factors. Globally mangroves are facing serious threat and are undergoing degradation due to anthropogenic pressure. In view of global changes, an assessment of carbon assimilation potential of mangroves is required for developing into a carbon sink and conservation of this fragile ecosystem is highly essential. In the present study, estimation and validation of mangrove GPP was carried out in Bhitarkanika national park (Odisha, India). Light Use Efficiency (LUE) was modelled from seasonal, diurnal in-situ photosynthetic rate observations on 11 dominant mangrove species. For estimation of GPP, 'vegetation photosynthetic model' framework was modified using water, temperature and salinity scalars derived from IRS Resourcesat 2 LISS-4, a Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite data. The incident Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) was derived from insolation product obtained from Geostationary (GEO) satellite KALPANA-1 VHRR for the observation period. Amongst all the species, highest LUE was found in Excoecaria agallocha in winter and summer (5.53 and 0.55 g C m-2 MJ-1, respectively), and in Aegiceras corniculatum in post-monsoon season (0.58 g C m-2 MJ-1). Seasonal 8-day average GPP was found to vary from 3.41 g Cm-2 to 14.4 g C m-2, with the highest in winter. Comparison of modelled estimates showed fairly good agreement with MODIS GPP (r = 0.89; n=118) having comparable coefficient of variation (41.8% in modelled and 49.5% in MODIS GPP). The present modelling approach of estimating GPP through GEO-LEO satellite can be used to quantify carbon sink in other Indian mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - The assessment of mangrove biomass and carbon in West Africa: a spatially explicit analytical framework
AB  - Mangrove forests are highly productive and have large carbon sinks while also providing numerous goods and ecosystem services. However, effective management and conservation of the mangrove forests are often dependent on spatially explicit assessments of the resource. Given the remote and highly dispersed nature of mangroves, estimation of biomass and carbon in mangroves through routine field-based inventories represents a challenging task which is impractical for large-scale planning and assessment. Alternative approaches based on geospatial technologies are needed to support this estimation in large areas. However, spatial data processing and analysis approaches used in this estimation of mangrove biomass and carbon have not been adequately investigated. In this study, we present a spatially explicit analytical framework that integrate remotely sensed data and spatial analyses approaches to support the estimation of mangrove biomass and carbon stock and their spatial patterns in West Africa. Forest canopy height derived from SRTM and ICESat/GLAS data was used to estimate mangrove biomass and carbon in nine West African countries. We developed a geospatial software toolkit that implemented the proposed framework. The spatial analysis framework and software toolkit provide solid support for the estimation and relative comparisons of mangrove-related metrics. While the mean canopy height of mangroves in our study area is 10.2Â m, the total biomass and carbon were estimated as 272.56 and 136.28Â Tg. Nigeria has the highest total mangrove biomass and carbon in the nine countries, but Cameroon is the country with the largest mean biomass and carbon density. The resulting spatially explicit distributions of mangrove biomass and carbon hold great potential in guiding the strategic planning of large-scale field-based assessment of mangrove forests. This study demonstrates the utility of online geospatial data and spatial analysis as a feasible solution for estimating the distribution of mangrove biomass and carbon at larger or smaller scales.

TI  - Interactions between hydrodynamics and pelagic ecosystems: Relevance to resource exploitation and climate change
AB  - A proposal is made to classify the pools of biogenic carbon in the oceans by reference to their turnover times. Break points in the continuum of turnover times, located at 10âˆ’2 and 102 years, distinguish between short-lived organic carbon, long-lived organic carbon and sequestered biogenic carbon. The three pools of biogenic carbon are discussed by reference to the more usual oceanographic concepts of new v. regenerated production, and export v. recycled production. Short-lived organic carbon is mainly associated with the microbial food-loop, long-lived organic carbon is relevant to renewable marine resources, and sequestered carbon is pertinent to global climate change (greenhouse effect). Recycling, export and sequestration are controlled by the proportions of primary production effected by small (&lt;5 Î¼m) and large (&gt;5 Î¼m) phytoplankton respectively, and by the selective grazing pressure experienced by cells in the various size-classes. These ecosystem processes are in turn governed by hydrodynamics. At low levels of auxiliary (mechanical) energy, the physical environment is stable, so that pelagic ecosystems are dominated by the microbial food-loop and biogenic carbon is mainly short-lived. Transitions from high levels of auxiliary energy to more stable conditions favour the production of large phytoplankton. When this takes place along predictable regular modes, primary production may be channelled into the long-lived pool, whereas stochastic transitions may lead to carbon sequestration. This theoretical framework may help the modern approaches of fisheries oceanography and biogeochemical oceanography to converge. Â© 1992 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Study of liquid CO2 droplet formation under simulated mid-depth ocean conditions
AB  - The concept of CO2 injection and dispersal in the mid-depth ocean presumes that associated environmental impacts can be minimized by rapid dilution of CO2 with large volumes of seawater. Toward this end, an international field experiment at an open ocean site is being planned to investigate the dispersion, dissolution, and transport phenomena of CO 2 ocean sequestration. To support this effort, complementary laboratory experiments are being pursued to examine CO2 droplet formation processes and to calibrate and to assess the performance of injector designs that will be used in the field experiment. The experiments reported in this paper were carried out in laboratory facilities at the University of Hawaii, the Southwest Research Institute, and in Japan that can simulate conditions in the deep ocean. Liquid CO2 was injected through a variety of removable, single and multiple orifice injectors mounted in pressure vessels filled with salt water. Injection velocity was varied and measurements of the resulting droplets were performed. Tests also were conducted to address operational concerns about possible hydrate blockage of injector orifices and the submerged CO2 conduit during system start-up and shutdown. Â© 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - PERMANENT CARBON SEQUESTRATION POTENTIAL IN OFFSHORE BASALT SEQUENCES ON THE NW EUROPEAN CONTINENTAL MARGINS
AB  - A dramatic reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions is necessary to achieve climate change targets. Wide ranging measures are required to reduce emissions with carbon capture and storage forming a vital component. Current carbon sequestration occurs in volumes of Mt/a into dominantly sedimentary reservoir rocks. Pilot tests have demonstrated that basalt reservoirs provide an alternative and permanent carbon capture scenario (e.g. Carbfix project). Here, we use 2D and 3D seismic data combined with well data to identify and map potential permanent and safe carbon storage reservoirs in offshore basalt sequences in the NE Atlantic. Well data support the presence of reservoir properties within extrusive basaltic sequences with porous lava flow tops and volcaniclastic lithologies comprising the most prolific sequestration targets. The basalt sequences are overlaid by several hundred meters of Cenozoic sediments with sealing properties, consisting mainly of marine shales and glaciogenic sediments. We hypothesize that offshore CO2 sequestration into porous basaltic lava flows may allow permanent CO2 sequestration of several gigatons per year, however more research and testing is needed to verify this potential.

TI  - Growth Dynamic of Tamarix chinensis Plantations in High Salinity Coastal Land and Its Ecological Effect
AB  - Tamarisk (Tamarix chinensis), a pioneer native halophyte from the coastal region of North China, has a high potential to establish in high salinity soil. The ecological benefits from planting tamarisk include changes to the structure and function of the saline land ecosystem. However, field experiments on the ecological benefit of using tamarisk in the restoration of saline lands along the coastal areas of China are lacking. In the current study, tamarisk was planted in 2005, 2007, and 2009 to assess the effectiveness of the plant in vegetation and saline soil restoration. The individual biomass, carbon sequestration, species diversity, and soil characteristics of tamarisk plantations in the different planting years were investigated. The results showed that tamarisk grew well with increasing individual biomass during the experimentation period. Carbon density increased from 0.98 t(C) hm(-2) (land without tamarisk) to 4.78 t(C) hm(-2) in the 3-year plots, 5.56 t(C) hm(-2) in the 5-year plots, and 6.89 t(C) hm(-2) in the 7-year plots. Significant soil quality improvement was indicated by lower soil salinity and higher organic matter. Salt content in the 0- to 10-cm soil layer of barren land was 10.53 g kg(-1), while it was only 3.35 g kg(-1), 1.86 g kg(-1), and 5.54 g kg(-1) in the 3-, 5-, and 7-year plots with tamarisk, respectively. Potassium (K) availability in the soil was increased. In addition, tamarisk played a significant ``eco-engine{'' role in terms of increasing the species of surrounding grasses. Where only 8 grass species existed in this area before tamarisk planting, a total of 15 grass species existed in the 7-year plot. However, the importance value of salt-tolerant species decreased in tamarisk plots. Clonal plants such as Aeluropus sinensis and Sonchus arvensis became more dominant than seed propagation plants such as Suaeda salsa. This suggested that tamarisk plants progressively alleviated salt stress in the coastal environment. The study demonstrated that tamarisk was effective in vegetation regeneration in saline lands, improving soil quality and increasing carbon sequestration.

TI  - Enzyme-mediated CO2 capture in oscillating structured packed-bed columns - Hydrodynamics and process performance for offshore applications
AB  - Gas-liquid countercurrent flow dynamics and enzymatic CO2 hydration performance in vertical, inclined, and oscillating structured packed-bed columns were explored via an unsteady-state 3-D model with the intent to understand the conduct of packed-bed columns under offshore conditions. A significant asymmetric countercurrent gas-liquid flow is established at larger structured packed-bed column permanent inclinations inducing noticeable liquid accumulation in lowermost cross-sectional area of the column. On the contrary, in marginally inclined structured packed-bed columns only a reduced fraction of liquid is subject to gravity-driven migration in circumferential and radial directions. Symmetrical externally-generated column oscillations give complex secondary flows in radial and circumferential directions resulting in oscillatory patterns around steady-state solution of vertical column position with the amplitude and propagation frequency influenced by the column sinusoidal angular motion. Inclined structured packed-bed columns underperform the vertical configuration for both enzymatic CO2 hydration processes with immobilized and solution-borne carbonic anhydrase. An oscillatory CO2 hydration performance around the steady-state solution of vertical column, affected by the parameters of angular motion of reactor, is generated by the symmetrical externally-induced reactor periodic oscillations. Though requiring a considerable amount of enzyme, CO2 removal efficiency is superior for the hydration process with solution-borne enzyme regardless of column configuration because of absence of diffusion within enzyme washcoat.

TI  - Growth-controlling processes of CO2 gas hydrates
AB  - During dissolution of liquid or gaseous CO2 into the ocean, a potential process for CO2 ocean sequestration to offset global warming, a hydrate film forms at the CO2-water interface and limits the CO2 dissolution rate. By experimentally studying the conditions under which such a CO2 gas hydrate film maintains a constant thickness, we determined the processes that control CO2 hydrate growth rates. A constant film thickness cannot be maintained when the decomposition rate exceeds a certain critical value. The decomposition rate was varied by adjusting the flow velocity of a water stream directed perpendicular to the hydrate film. An increase of the flow speed increased the decomposition rate, which decreased the steady-state film thickness. However, at a critical value, net decomposition occurs and the hydrate film completely dissolves. The critical decomposition rates are roughly proportional to pressure and relatively independent of temperature from 274.6 to 278.7 K. The transport of H2O through the hydrate layer to the growth sites near the CO2-hydrate interface controls the growth rate when it is relatively small, but the supply of CO2 molecules limits it at relatively high growth rates.

TI  - Nutrients and trace elements of semi-arid dwarf and fully developed mangrove soils, northwestern Venezuela
AB  - Mangrove forests are characterized by a high carbon storage capacity. Anthropogenic activities and the climate change are threatening the stability of these ecosystems, specially those that are surviving on extreme environmental conditions, representing the most susceptible groups. This study aims to understand the geochemical differences of soils of mangrove forest with diverse degree of development of Rhizophora mangle and Avicennia germinans, located in two semi-arid regions from the Falcon state, Venezuela. The soil samples were collected in Punta CaimÃ¡n region (dwarf mangroves of less than 2 meters height) and Boca de caÃ±o lagoon (fully developed mangroves of up to 8 meters height). The trace elements and macronutrients were determined in two sequential extraction, first with 1M HCl followed by an extraction with ultrapure grade HNO3. Results showed that, in general, dwarf mangroves have limited capability to accumulate organic matter in the soil (average TOC of 0.6 Â± 0.2 %) and that the sampled surface soils from the dwarf mangrove region had no differences with deeper material. On the other hand, the TOC of soils dominated by developed mangroves is 6 Â± 2 % , representative of semi-arid conditions. Moreover, the soils dominated by dwarf mangroves are characterized high concentrations of trace elements related to the chalcophile group. The difference in soil chemistry between Rhizophora mangle and Avicennia germinans becomes significant when mangroves are fully developed. Finally, soils of dwarf mangrove forests presented a greater concentration of trace elements than soils of fully developed mangroves, which might be due to a different sediment source, to an anthropogenic influence or to the difference in organic matter.

TI  - Retention capacity of seals from hydrocarbon field analogues for appraisal of saline aquifers
AB  - Saline aquifers have very large potential as stores for carbon dioxide, but the seals are untested. The effectiveness of typical sealing lithologies can be assessed using natural hydrocarbon reservoirs. The heights of the hydrocarbon columns in many natural reservoirs are limited by a spill point or by the limited thickness of the reservoir; however, amongst the remaining reservoirs the range of calculated limiting porethroat radii correspond with measured literature values worldwide. This suggests that capillary leakage is the limiting factor in the retention of hydrocarbons in many natural accumulations, and is at least potentially the limiting factor in CO2 storage. The distribution of limiting porethroat radii for oil and gas fields of the UK North Sea could be used with caution as a generic input for statistical assessment of a prospective CO2 storage location at an early stage of investigation, before measured site-specific data is available. The calculated limiting porethroat radii show only a weak decrease with burial depth and no correlation to the degree of faulting of the seal. There is a strong correlation with seal lithology; calculated radii for halite seals are significantly smaller than for the majority of shale seals. There is no difference between the calculated limiting porethroat radii for fields with at least some degree of fault sealing, compared to those with no reported fault sealing. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Coupled Carbon Dioxide Sequestration and Energy Production From Geopressured/Geothermal Aquifers
AB  - The current approach to carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) from pulverized-coal-fired power plants is not economically viable without either large subsidies or a very high price on carbon. Current schemes require roughly one-third of a power-plant's energy for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and pressurization. The production of energy from geopressured aquifers has evolved as a separate, independent technology from the sequestration of CO2 in deep, saline aquifers. A game-changing new idea is described here that combines the two technologies and adds another-the dissolution of CO2 into extracted brine that is then reinjected. A systematic investigation covering a range of conditions was performed to explore the best strategy for the coupled process of CO2 sequestration and energy production. Geological models of geopressured/geothermal aquifers were developed with available data from studies of Gulf Coast aquifers. These geological models were used to perform compositional reservoir simulations of realistic processes with coupled aquifer and wellbore models.

TI  - Presence of trace elements in sediments of Can Gio mangrove forest, Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam
AB  - Can Gio mangrove forest (CGM) is located in the South-East of Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), situated between an estuarine system of Dong Nai-Sai Gon river and a part of Vam Co river. The CGM is the largest restored mangrove forest in Vietnam and the UNESCO's Mangrove Biosphere Reserve. The CGM has been gradually facing to numeric challenges of global climate change, environmental degradation and socio-economic development for the last decades. To evaluate sediment quality in the CGM, we collected 13 cores to analyze for sediment grain size, organic matter content, and trace element concentration of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn. Results showed that trace element concentrations ranged from uncontaminated (Cd, Cu, and Zn) to very minor contaminated (Cr, Ni, and Pb). The concentrations were gradually influenced by suspended particle size and the mangrove plants.

TI  - Sustained growth of the Southern Ocean carbon storage in a warming climate
AB  - We investigate the mechanisms controlling the evolution of Southern Ocean carbon storage under a future climate warming scenario. A subset of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models predicts that the inventory of biologically sequestered carbon south of 40Â°S increases about 18-34 Pg C by 2100 relative to the preindustrial condition. Sensitivity experiments with an ocean circulation and biogeochemistry model illustrates the impacts of the wind and buoyancy forcings under a warming climate. Intensified and poleward shifted westerly wind strengthens the upper overturning circulation, not only leading to an increased uptake of anthropogenic CO2 but also releasing biologically regenerated carbon to the atmosphere. Freshening of Antarctic Surface Water causes a slowdown of the lower overturning circulation, leading to an increased Southern Ocean biological carbon storage. The rectified effect of these processes operating together is the sustained growth of the carbon storage in the Southern Ocean, even under the warming climate with a weaker global ocean carbon uptake.

TI  - Zonal distribution of coarse woody debris and its contribution to net primary production in a secondary mangrove forest
AB  - Coarse woody debris (CWD) plays an important role in long-term carbon storage in forest ecosystems. However, few studies have examined CWD in mangrove forests. A secondary mangrove forest on an estuary of the Trat River showed different structures along vegetation zones ranging from the riverâ€™s edge to inland parts of the forest (the Sonneratiaâ€“Avicennia, Avicennia, Rhizophora, and Xylocarpus zones, respectively). The mass distribution of CWD stock in downed wood and standing dead trees along these vegetation zones was evaluated. Most of the CWD stock in the Sonneratiaâ€“Avicennia and Avicennia zones was found in downed wood, while it mainly accumulated in standing dead trees in the Rhizophora and Xylocarpus zones. The total mass of CWD stock that accumulated in each zone ranged from 1.56â€“8.39Â tÂ haâˆ’1, depending on the forest structure and inundation regimes. The annual woody debris flux in each zone was calculated by summing the necromass (excluding foliage) of dead trees and coarse litter from 2010 to 2013. The average woody debris flux was 5.4Â tÂ haâˆ’1Â yearâˆ’1, and its zonal variation principally depended on the necromass production that resulted from forest succession, high tree-density, and lightning. Over all the zones, the above- and below-ground net primary production (ANPP and BNPP, respectively) was estimated at 18.0 and 3.6Â tÂ haâˆ’1Â yearâˆ’1, respectively. The magnitude of BNPP and its contribution to the NPP was markedly increased when fine root production was taken into consideration. The contribution of the woody debris flux without root necromass to the ANPP ranged from 12 to 28%. Â© 2016, The Ecological Society of Japan.

TI  - Evolution of blue carbon management policies in China: review, performance and prospects
AB  - Since 1982, China's blue carbon management policies have made significant contributions to blue carbon's development. Blue carbon is carbon captured and stored by marine ecosystems and it plays an important role in addressing climate change. Analyzing the evolution of blue carbon management policy is necessary to understand its potential to contribute to climate action, and to improve its management and maximize its effectiveness. This paper considers these issues in China. It used content analysis and ROSTCM6 software to empirically analyze 82 blue carbon management policy documents from China. The evolution of relevant policies and their performance is as follows: First, policy focus has gradually shifted from protecting blue carbon ecosystems to increasing blue carbon stocks; second, policy participants became increasingly diversified; and third, the policy approach has changed from simple protection to comprehensive, integrated land use - marine system management. Although the Chinese government has made progress in blue carbon management policies, it still faces many challenges including blue carbon ecosystem protection; legal status; trading mechanisms; and international cooperation. The development of future blue carbon management policy should focus on optimizing the land use structure of coastal zones, on promoting environmental legislation highlighting blue carbon issues, on supporting the establishment of blue carbon trading mechanisms, and on strengthening its international cooperation in this arena. Key policy insights China's blue carbon management approaches shows that relevant policies contribute greatly to addressing climate change and sustainable development. This provides new theoretical support to promote future development of blue carbon management policies. Establishing a blue carbon trading mechanism provides economic incentives for its management. Blue carbon's property rights, accounting standards, and trading entities need to be further clarified. A detailed legal definition of blue carbon is needed to ensure that appropriate penalties are imposed for the destruction of blue carbon ecosystems.

TI  - Biosynthesis and biodegradation of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) from Priestia flexa; A promising mangrove halophyte towards the development of sustainable
AB  - The protracted persistence of petrochemical plastics in the environment and their non-biodegradability impede the survival of living creatures. Recently, biopolymers are being thoroughly researched as a potential replacement for conventional plastics. This present study sought to locate Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) synthesizing bacterial species prevalent in the mangrove ecosystem. Six halophilic bacterial isolates were obtained from the mangrove habitat, four isolates displayed superior cell dry weight as well as PHB accumulation. Isolate PMPHB5 showed the highest cell dry weight (4.92 +/- 0.02 g/L), while the maximum PHA yield (80\%) was found with PMPHB7. Hence, PMPHB7 was chosen for further optimization of carbon source wherein glucose demonstrated improved cell growth as well as PHB production. The characterization of the PHB granules was performed by FTIR spectroscopy and FE-SEM EDX. The presence of characteristic elements in the sample was confirmed using EDX. Isolate PMPHB7 was further identified as Priestia flexa through 16S rRNA gene sequencing (GenBank accession number: ON362236) and a phylogenetic tree was constructed to reveal the molecular relationships of this organism with others. The solvent-cast biopolymer film was made to check the biodegradability of the extracted PHB. When buried in soil, it was found that the biopolymer film exhibited approximately 73\% biodegradation after 21 days. Thus, the present study sheds light on the potential of mangrove-associated halophytes to efficiently produce PHB that is readily biodegradable in soil.

TI  - Forgotten peatlands of eastern Australia: An unaccounted carbon capture and storage system
AB  - In a carbon-constrained world, global peatlands are vital carbon capture and storage systems. Here we calculate regional carbon stocks, sequestration rates and potential carbon emissions of Temperate Highland Peat Swamps on Sandstone (THPSS) found in low order headwater streams in eastern Australia. We find that total carbon stocks within THPSS in two regions are 25 Mt CO2 eq. with annual carbon sequestration rates at 60.5 kt CO2 eq. A risk assessment model, based on anthropogenic activities known to impair the carbon storage functions of THPSS is used to identify swamps most at risk of carbon loss. Potential CO2 emissions from at risk swamps could be up to 8.6 Mt CO2 eq. When carbon stock is valued at the current carbon abatement price of \$AUD16.10 t(-1) CO2 eq, the total value of THPSS is over AUD\$404 million dollars (US\$281 million). This makes a strong economic case for the implementation of sustainable swamp conservation and restoration activities. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Numerical Analysis of the Effects of Supercritical CO2 Injection on CO2 Storage Capacities of Geological Formations
AB  - One of the most promising means of reducing carbon content in the atmosphere, which is aimed at tackling the threats of global warming, is injecting carbon dioxide (CO2) into deep saline aquifers (DSAs). Keeping this in mind, this research aims to investigate the effects of various injection schemes/scenarios and aquifer characteristics with a particular view to enhance the current understanding of the key permanent sequestration mechanisms, namely, residual and solubility trapping of CO2. The paper also aims to study the influence of different injection scenarios and flow conditions on the CO2 storage capacity and efficiency of DSAs. Furthermore, a specific term of the permanent capacity and efficiency factor of CO2 immobilization in sedimentary formations is introduced to help facilitate the above analysis. Analyses for the effects of various injection schemes/scenarios and aquifer characteristics on enhancing the key permanent sequestration mechanisms is examined through a series of numerical simulations employed on 3D homogeneous and heterogeneous aquifers based on the geological settings for Sleipner Vest Field, which is located in the Norwegian part of the North Sea. The simulation results highlight the effects of heterogeneity, permeability isotropy, injection orientation and methodology, and domain-grid refinement on the capillary pressureâ€“saturation relationships and the amounts of integrated CO2 throughout the timeline of the simulation via different trapping mechanisms (solubility, residual and structural) and accordingly affect the efficiency of CO2 sequestration. The results have shown that heterogeneity increases the residual trapping of CO2, while homogeneous formations promote more CO2 dissolution because fluid flows faster in homogeneous porous media, inducing more contact with fresh brine, leading to higher dissolution rates of CO2 compared to those in heterogeneous porous medium, which limits fluid seepage. Cyclic injection has been shown to have more influence on heterogenous domains as it increases the capillary pressure, which forces more CO2 into smaller-sized pores to be trapped and exposed to dissolution in the brine at later stages of storage. Storage efficiency increases proportionally with the vertical-to-horizontal permeability ratio of geological formations because higher ratios facilitate the further extent of the gas plume and increases the solubility trapping of the integrated gas. The developed methodology and the presented results are expected to play key roles in providing further insights for assessing the feasibility of various geological formations for CO2 storage.

TI  - Geological storage potential of CO2 emissions for China's coal-fired power plants: A city-level analysis
AB  - To mitigate global warming to temperatures no higher than 2 degrees C or even less than 1.5 degrees C, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is indispensable. This is especially true for China, which relies heavily on coal-fired power plants. In China, CCS could play an important role in removing CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants and establishing low-carbon cities. Clarifying the emissions reduction potential of cities using CO2 geological storage will help to identify site suitable for carrying out CCS projects in a technically and economically feasible way. In this paper, we assessed CO2 storage capacity in three geological structures between 800 to 3000 m underground: (1) the nationwide on-shore CO2 storage capacity of 705 oil fields in terms of both depleted oil reservoirs (DOR) and enhanced oil recovery (EOR); (2) 754 gas fields in terms of both depleted gas reservoirs (DGR) and enhanced gas recovery (EGR); (3) China's deep saline aquifers (DSA), including 17 large basins; and (4) the CO2 emissions of coal-fired plants of 300 MW and over. After completing all of these assessments, this paper presents an emissions reduction potential estimate. The results show that: 1) the total CO2 storage capacity of DOR, EOR, DGR, EGR and DSA is 21,287 Mt, 5191 Mt, 15,321 Mt, 9018 Mt and 1,004,319 Mt, respectively; 2) 76 cities can sequester their existing CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants in situ within their administrative boundaries for over 10 years, and their contribution is 634.43 Mt per year. 3) Ordos City has priority to carry out CO2 geological storage for coal-fired power plants due to the volume of its annual captured CO2 (52.13 Mt), and it can operate for about 123 years if its CO2 emissions remain unchanged.

TI  - Nutrient subsidies delivered by seabirds to mangrove islands
AB  - In nutrient-poor landscapes, external nutrient subsidies are important for sustaining local production. Seabirds can transport marine nutrients in the form of guano to terrestrial and coastal ecosystems where they can relieve nutrient limitation. We assessed whether seabirds provide nutrient subsidies to mangrove islands that are strongly limited by phosphorus (P) in the Yucatan Peninsula. Our hypotheses were: (1) seabirds transport nutrients to mangrove islands, (2) mangroves use marine-derived nutrients and (3) nutrient inputs are higher during the nesting season. We chose 6 mangrove islands within a coastal lagoon: 2 with no birds, 2 with temporary birds and 2 with permanent bird colonies. On each, we measured forest structure and soil characteristics (P, pH, salinity and organic matter) for 3 seasons (dry, wet and trade wind season). We collected leaves (green and senescent) to determine P content and resorption efficiency as a measurement of nutrient limitation. Green leaves were also sampled for delta C-13 and delta N-15 to determine nutrient origin. Results show that islands with permanent bird colonies have the highest soil nutrients, which are used by the mangrove trees and relieve some of their nutrient limitation. Nutrient inputs were homogenously distributed through the sediment column, although a decrease in P and an increase in the N:P ratio in the first 20 cm suggests bacterial consumption. Bird nutrient inputs are seasonal, with highest inputs during the nesting season. This study shows an example in which marine-derived nutrients could be important for production of coastal mangrove islands.

TI  - Modelling the effects and economics of managed realignment on the cycling and storage of nutrients, carbon and sediments in the Blackwater estuary UK
AB  - A hydrodynamic model is developed for the Blackwater estuary (UK) and used to estimate nitrate removal by denitrification. Using the model, sediment analysis and estimates of sedimentation rates, we estimate changes in estuarine denitrification and intertidal carbon and nutrient storage and associated value of habitat created under a scenario of extensive managed realignment. We then use this information, together with engineering and land costs, to conduct a cost benefit analysis of the managed realignment. This demonstrates that over a 50-100 year timescale the value of the habitat created and carbon buried is sufficient to make the large scale managed realignment cost effective. The analysis reveals that carbon and nutrient storage plus habitat creation represent major and quantifiable benefits of realignment. The methodology described here can be readily transferred to other coastal systems. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Practical Reviews on CO2 Sequestration in Korean Sedimentary Basins and Geophysical Responses of CO2-injected Sediments
AB  - Geological CO2 sequestration is an effective means of reducing the emission of carbon dioxide. The Korean government aims to reduce CO2 emissions by 30\% comparing to the usual amounts of emissions by 2020. It is expected that geological CO2 storage technology will account for more than 10\% of the reduction of CO2 emissions. The forward strategies and technologies of CO2 sequestration in Korea need to be determined depending on the geological conditions of potential sites in Korea; moreover, the geophysical characteristics of CO2 and the reservoirs depend on the geological conditions. However, previous domestic studies related to geological conditions and the geophysical behavior of Korean sedimentary basins are rare thus far, with only a few studies focusing on numerical modeling. This study aims to review the geological characteristics of CO2 storage projects around the world and in Korea while also discussing the suitability for CO2 sequestration. Moreover, a laboratory approach simulating an in-situ high effective stress condition with silty sand from the Bukpyeong basin is attempted in an effort to determine the geophysical behaviors. This study offers an improved understanding of the possibility and potential of CO2 sequestration in Korea.

TI  - Ocean thermal energy for abatement of global CO2 emissions
AB  - The world's oceans are the largest collectors and storage of solar energy and have an enormous potential to supply growing worldwide energy demands, commodity products like ammonia, and fresh water. Global energy, environment, and economic settings have drastically changed: uncertain energy costs; increased energy demands of economic emerging countries; awareness of impact of CO2 emission; recognition of Energy-Water-Food Nexus to support alternate energy production and growing population. There are global movements of reducing CO2 emissions. Besides replacing coal with natural gas and CO2 capture &amp; sequestration (CCS) new technologies are being developed for conversion of CO2 to value-added products. Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) has potentials of making significant contribution to reduce global CO2 emissions. With full implementation by 2040, the OTEC technology would play a significant role in the global CO2 abatement.

TI  - Exporting CO2 for sub-seabed storage: The non-effective amendment to the London dumping protocol and its implications
AB  - The vast amounts of fossil fuels available and the forecasts regarding their future utilisation can make carbon capture and storage/sequestration (CCS) an attractive option, despite the various challenges associated with the technology. In order to be viable, many CCS projects will have to be transboundary, in the sense that CO2 will be stored in a country other than from where it was captured. The most attractive, or even the only available, storage option is often offshore. However, export of CO2 for sub-seabed storage is prohibited as dumping by the 1996 London Protocol. An amendment to the Protocol that enables export was adopted in 2009, but is unlikely to enter into force. The article analyses the implications of this situation and explores possible options for States that see export of CO2 for sub-seabed storage as an important policy option.

TI  - Tradeoffs between reducing flood risks and storing carbon stocks in mangroves
AB  - Mangrove habitats are important carbon(C) reserve sites. However, the overgrowth or overexpansion of mangroves may increase the risk of flooding, thus affecting human wellbeing. To decrease the flood risks, partial mangrove removal has been proposed as a managerial action, which would decrease the C stocks. Using the Danshuel River as a case study, the objective of this study was to determine the optimal removal area to allow the mangroves to meet the demands of reducing the loss of mangrove C stocks and adequately controlling the flood risks. Our results show that the ratios of the effective reduction in flood level (benefit) and the loss of mangrove C stocks (cost) were only higher under the condition of the removal of aboveground structures of mangrove trees than the ratios under the condition of the removal of both above- and belowground structures. The highest ratio of the effective reduction in flood level and the loss of mangrove C stocks occurred under the condition of removal of 20\% of aboveground structures of mangrove trees, indicating the optimal removal area for mangrove management in the Danshuei River. This study provides a case study exhibiting the tradeoffs between ecosystem services in mangrove management. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ocean disposal of CO2 at intermediate depths
AB  - One option to reduce atmospheric CO2 levels is to capture and sequester power plant CO2. Commercial CO2 capture technology, though expensive, exists today. However, the ability to dispose of large quantities of CO2 is highly uncertain. The deep ocean is one of only a few possible CO2 disposal options (others are depleted oil and gas wells or deep, confined aquifers) and is a prime candidate because the deep ocean is vast and highly unsaturated in CO2. The term disposal is really a misnomer because the atmosphere and ocean eventually equilibrate on a timescale of 1000 years regardless of where the CO2 is originally discharged. However, peak atmospheric CO2 concentrations expected to occur in the next few centuries could be significantly reduced by ocean disposal. The magnitude of this reduction will depend upon the quantity of CO2 injected in the ocean, as well as the depth and location of injection. From ocean scale mathematical models which compare the impact of releasing fossil-fuel CO2 into the ocean at various depths1-4, we conclude that a sequestration depth of about 1000 m is required to achieve desired residence times on the order of hundreds of years. Below we summarize several modes of CO2 injection which have been identified in the literature. All offer advantages and disadvantages. We conclude that the most feasible initial options will involve a release of liquid CO2 at intermediate depths of 1000 to 1500 m. Either an unconfined release leading to a buoyant droplet plume or a confined release leading to a dense CO2-seawater solution would work. The intermediate discharge depth represents a compromise between the depth of ultimate sequestration, current engineering technology and national jurisdiction limits. We outline steps toward implementation of these options, including needed studies on injector design, transport and costs, site selection and environmental and legal considerations. Â© 1995.

TI  - Circular carbon economy (Cce): A way to invest co2 and protect the environment, a review
AB  - Increased levels of carbon dioxide have revolutionised the Earth; higher temperatures, melting icecaps, and flooding are now more prevalent. Fortunately, renewable energy mitigates this problem by making up 20% of human energy needs. However, from a â€œgreen environmentâ€ perspective, can carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere be reduced and eliminated? The carbon economic circle is an ideal solution to this problem, as it enables us to store, use, and remove carbon dioxide. This research introduces the circular carbon economy (CCE) and addresses its economic importance. Additionally, the paper discusses carbon capture and storage (CCS), and the utilisation of CO2 . Furthermore, it explains current technologies and their future applications on environmental impact, CO2 capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS). Various opinions on the best way to achieve zero carbon emissions and on CO2 applications and their economic impact are also discussed. The circular carbon economy can be achieved through a highly transparent global administration that is supportive of advanced technologies that contribute to the efficient utilisation of energy sources. This global administration must also provide facilities to modernise and develop factories and power stations, based on emission-reducing technologies. Monitoring emissions in countries through a global monitoring network system, based on actual field measurements, linked to a worldwide database allows all stakeholders to track the change in greenhouse gas emissions. The process of sequestering carbon dioxide in the ocean is affected by the support for technologies and industries that adopt the principle of carbon recycling in order to maintain the balance. This includes supporting initiatives that contribute to increasing vegetation cover and preserving oceans from pollutants, especially chemicals and radioactive pollutants, which will undoubtedly affect the process of sequestering carbon dioxide in the oceans, and this will contribute significantly to maintaining carbon dioxide at acceptable levels.

TI  - Aviation fueling: A cleaner, greener approach
AB  - Projected growth of aviation depends on fueling where specific needs must be met. Safety is paramount, and along with political, social, environmental and legacy transport systems requirements, alternate aviation fueling becomes an opportunity of enormous proportions. Biofuels - sourced from halophytes, algae, cyanobacteria, and "weeds" using wastelands, waste water, and seawater - have the capacity to be drop-in fuel replacements for petroleum fuels. Biojet fuels from such sources solves the aviation CO 2 emissions issue and do not compete with food or freshwater needs. They are not detrimental to the social or environmental fabric and use the existing fuels infrastructure. Cost and sustainable supply remains the major impediments to alternate fuels. Halophytes are the near-term solution to biomass/biofuels capacity at reasonable costs; they simply involve more farming, at usual farming costs. Biofuels represent a win-win approach, proffering as they do - at least the ones we are studying - massive capacity, climate neutral-to-some sequestration, and ultimately, reasonable costs.

TI  - General interest: Carbon sequestration forum approves capture projects
AB  - The latest ministerial statement from the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum held in Melbourne has approved 10 collaborative carbon capture and storage projects around the world. The projects are designed to increase knowledge in aspects of geosequestration, including technology, economics, health, safety, and environmental issues. Of the pilot projects, the two most advanced are the Weyburn enhanced oil recovery (EOR) project in Saskatchewan, and the Sleipner offshore gas field development in the Norwegian North Sea. The US, Canada, and Japan are working together in the Weyburn II CO2 storage project. Phase I conducted trials of CO2 injection into the oil reservoir. Phase II will magnify the scale with the transport of 95 million cu ft/day of 95% pure CO2 to the field via a 320-km pipeline from North Dakota. The CO2 will be injected into the field for EOR. This new phase will monitor the CO2 migration within the reservoir to determine its performance as an EOR tool and to assess any risks involved in its long-term use and intake into the reservoir.

TI  - Water Biogeochemistry of a Mangrove-Dominated Estuary Under a Semi-Arid Climate (New Caledonia)
AB  - Mangrove water biogeochemistry has been frequently studied under tropical climates, but less is known regarding mangroves in semi-arid climates. In this study, we examine the carbon and nutrient biogeochemistry in a mangrove tidal creek and in the main branch of a semi-arid estuary in New Caledonia. Porewater seepage represents a source of nutrients (DON, NH4 (+), and DIP), carbon (DOC and CO2), and alkalinity for the water column, but seawater dilution of the mangrove inputs is observed. Spatial and tidal variations in CO2 fluxes along the tidal creek suggest that porewater seepage is a driver of CO2 emission into the atmosphere. Large seasonal and spatial differences in the biogeochemical functioning of the main channel are observed and are mainly related to the seasonal rainfall pattern. During the rainy season, the watershed influences the entire estuary, which exhibits a typical positive circulation. During the dry season, the estuary turns into a salt-plug region with positive and negative circulations in the upper and lower reaches, respectively. In this case, the upper and lower reaches seem to function independently, and the biogeochemical functioning of their water column is not controlled by the same processes. Surprisingly, pCO(2)@27 A degrees C values tend to be higher during the dry season, as do the total alkalinity (TAlk) values, while the pH values exhibit an opposite trend. Moreover, the TAlk values are higher in the lower reaches during the wet season and in the upper reaches during the dry season. These results indicate high in situ biogeochemical reactions and high porewater influence during the dry season, likely because of a low flushing rate and high water residence time after salt plug establishment. Although our results suggest that salt plugs may significantly affect the water column's biogeochemistry and may promote CO2 emissions of mangrove-derived carbon, further investigations, especially mass balance studies, are required to quantify their role in the biogeochemical functioning of such estuarine systems.

TI  - Engaging the Community with a ``Green Town{''} Concept
AB  - This paper describes a novel CO2 mitigation concept named ``Green Town{''}. ``Green Town{''} is a fully integrated carbon capture and storage (CCS) system applied at a town or city scale. It utilises air capture techniques to capture CO2 directly from atmosphere, as opposed to other CCS systems where CO2 is typically captured in flue gas streams pre- or post-combustion, then the captured CO2 is transported by pipeline and sequestered in offshore deep geological formations. The entire system is meant to be built within a community and in this way to inspire and interest the public and the younger generation regarding CCS technology. With enhanced public understanding of CO2 mitigation via CCS techniques it is therefore possible to engage the public in the early stage of CCS implementation. Technical details of the ``Green Town{'' concept are given. To evaluate public acceptance of the ``Green Town{''} concept, questionnaire surveys were designed and carried in Southampton, UK and Hamburg, Germany in August 2011. Total of 158 and 366 effective completed questionnaires were collected from these two cities respectively. Results from both surveys are presented. It is shown that generally there was a direct correlation between positive perception of CCS and positive perception of the ``Green Town{''} idea. There was a stronger preference for the ``Green Town{'' concept than for conventional CCS. This provides evidence that the idea of engaging the public through the ``Green Town{''} concept could play an important role in laying a strong foundation for public interest in CCS projects. To explore the diversity of opinions on the ``Green Town{''} idea and CCS between the two surveyed cities, a comparison of results from Southampton and Hamburg is also presented. The proposed ``Green Town{''} concept of air capture in the community was shown to be a viably possible route for public engagement in this or other CCS projects. (C) 2013 The Authors.

TI  - Effects of marine pollution, climate, and tidal range on biomass and sediment organic carbon in Chinese mangrove forests
AB  - Mangroves are among the most important carbon reservoirs for atmospheric CO2. Nonetheless, how the biomass and sediment organic carbon (SOC) of mangrove forests are affected by marine pollution, in addition to climate and tidal range, on a regional scale is unknown. This study aimed to assess how spatial patterns of biomass and SOC could be influenced by the climate, tidal range, and marine pollution in China's mangrove forests. The result showed that aboveground biomass (AGB), surface SOC content (SOCC), and SOC density (SOCD) showed clear latitudinal change patterns on a regional scale and decreased in a non-linear manner with increasing latitude. Correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that latitudinal variation in AGB, SOCC, and SOCD was mainly regulated by temperature-related indicators. However, AGB, SOCC, and SOCD were not found to be correlated to annual precipitation. Besides, the tidal range was found to be negatively correlated to biomass and SOC content/stock. Tidal range is one important abiotic predictor used to understand the latitudinal patterns of mangrove biomass and SOC dynamics. Correlation analysis and PCA revealed that mangrove biomass and SOC content/stock were negatively affected by heavy metal pollution, and they were disproportionately negatively correlated to marine heavy metal concentrations in the coastlines neighboring mangrove forests. Environmentally-sound technology should be adapted to prevent, control, and remediate heavy metal pollution to increase carbon storage in China's mangrove forests. Mangrove biomass and SOC content/stock were also found to be negatively related to the suspended solid concentration in the coastlines neighboring mangrove forests. In contrast, vegetation biomass was found to be positively correlated to ammonia nitrogen content. However, biomass was found to be not correlated to nitrate-nitrogen, nitrites-nitrogen, inorganic forms of nitrogen, and non-ionic ammonia. Additional studies are needed to confirm the mechanisms by which different forms of nitrogen enrichment affect biomass storage.

TI  - Enhancing global sinks of carbon dioxide
AB  - There do not appear to be any inducements for developing countries not to burn their fossil fuel reserves. Increasing natural CO2 sinks will be more effective in controlling climate than attempting to hold constant the global rates of fossil fuel burning. Enhanced sinks seem to be the answer to the future problems of the developing countries by allowing them to use cheap energy. Enhanced sinks appear to be a practical solution to greenhouse gas control and they convert the CO2 to an economic product in the form of wood or fish. Carbon sinks also have the advantage over other strategies in that the technology are well understood and can be implemented with only a modest evolution in technology. The development of enhanced sink technology may hold the key to Australia meeting its greenhouse gas commitments. Australia has many marginal range lands as well as many deep ocean basins along its east and south coastlines. The effective management of these resources presents an opportunity for Australia to meet its greenhouse gas commitments and achieve its goal of becoming the "clever country' by exporting carbon sink technology. -from Authors

TI  - Distribution and correlations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with organic carbon and black carbon in surface sediments of three mangrove wetlands in the Shantou Wetland Demonstration Site, China
AB  - Distribution of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and correlation with Organic Carbon (OC) and Black Carbon (BC) were determined in surface sediment from three mangrove wetlands (Suai Wan Aegiceras corniculatum mangrove, Waisha estuarine Sonneratia caseolaris and Sonneratia Apetala mangrove, and Yifeng estuarine Sonneratia Apetala mangrove) inside the Shantou Wetland Demonstration Site, China. Results showed that concentrations of PAHs absorbed and accumulated by sediments of a natural mangrove forest wetland were higher than that of artificially restored mangrove forest wetlands. However, PAH compositions in sediments were similar in the three mangrove wetlands. Total PAHs concentrations in inner mangrove sediment were higher than sediment at mangrove edges. Mangrove edge sediment had higher PAH levels than low tidal mudflat sediment except for the Yifeng estuarine mangrove wetland. The high molecular weight PAHs (HPAHs) were strongly absorbed by organic carbon and black carbon. The low molecular weight PAHs (LPAHs) were not as strongly adsorbed as the HPAH's. Sorption by BC was greater than sorption by OC.

TI  - 3D geomechanical modelling for CO2 geologic storage in the Dogger carbonates of the Paris Basin
AB  - CO2 injection into a depleted hydrocarbon field or aquifer may give rise to a variety of coupled physical and chemical processes. During CO2 injection, the increase in pore pressure can induce reservoir expansion. As a result the in situ stress field may change in and around the reservoir. The geomechanical behaviour induced by oil production followed by CO2 injections into an oil field reservoir in the Paris Basin has been numerically modelled. This paper deals with an evaluation of the induced deformations and in situ stress changes, and their potential effects on faults, using a 3D geomechanical model. The geomechanical analysis of the reservoir-caprock system was carried out as a feasibility study using pressure information in a "one way" coupling, where pressures issued from reservoir simulations were integrated as input for a geomechanical model. The results show that under specific assumptions the mechanical effects of CO2 injection do not affect the mechanical stability of the reservoir-caprock system. The ground vertical movement at the surface ranges from -2 mm during oil production to +2.5 mm during CO2 injection. Furthermore, the changes in in situ stresses predicted under specific assumptions by geomechanical modelling are not significant enough to jeopardize the mechanical stability of the reservoir and caprock. The stress changes issued from the 3D geomechanical modelling are also combined with a Mohr-Coulomb analysis to determine the fault slip tendency. By integrating the stress changes issued from the geomechanical modelling into the fault stability analysis, the critical pore pressure for fault reactivation is higher than calculated for the fault stability analysis considering constant horizontal stresses.

TI  - Short-Term Dissolved Organic Carbon Dynamics Reflect Tidal, Water Management, and Precipitation Patterns in a Subtropical Estuary
AB  - Estuaries significantly impact the global carbon cycle by regulating the exchange of organic matter, primarily in the form of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), between terrestrial and marine carbon pools. Estuarine DOC dynamics are complex as tides and other hydrological and climatic drivers can affect carbon fluxes on short and long time scales. While estuarine and coastal DOC dynamics have been well-studied, variations on short time scales are less well-constrained. Recent advancements in sonde technology enable autonomous in situ collection of high frequency DOC data using fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) as a proxy, dramatically improving our capacity to characterize rapid changes in DOC, even in remote ecosystems. This study utilizes high-frequency FDOM measurements to untangle rapid and complex hydrologic drivers of DOC in the Shark River estuary, the main drainage of Everglades National Park, Florida. Non-conservative mixing of FDOM along the salinity gradient suggested mangrove inputs accounted for 6\% of the total DOC pool. Average changes in FDOM concentrations through individual tidal cycles ranged from less than 10\% to greater than 50\% and multi-day trends >100\% change in FDOM concentration were observed. Salinity and water level both inversely correlated to FDOM at sub-hourly and daily resolutions, while freshwater controls via precipitation and water management were observed at diel to monthly time-scales. In particular, the role of water management in rapidly shifting estuarine salinity gradients and DOC export regimes at sub-weekly time-scales was evident. Additionally, sub-hourly spikes in ebb tide FDOM indicated rapid exchange of DOC between mangrove sediments and the river channel. DOC fluxes calculated from high-resolution FDOM measurements were compared to monthly DOC measurements with high-resolution fluxes considerably improving accuracy of fluxes (thereby constraining carbon budgets). This study provides a better understanding of short-term DOC dynamics and associated hydrological drivers and indicates the importance of high-frequency measurements to accurately constrain coastal carbon processes and budgets, particularly in coastal systems increasingly altered by hydrologic restoration and climate change.

TI  - Multiphase flow behaviour during CO2 geo-sequestration: Emphasis on the effect of cyclic CO2-brine flooding
AB  - Geo-sequestration is considered to have a significant global potential for reducing the amount of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, in particular carbon dioxide. In simple terms CO2 geo-sequestration involves capturing the gas at its emitting source and then compressing and injecting it into a deep underground geological reservoir with a known seal where it will exist as a dense supercritical fluid. In this way the unwanted gas will be sequestered for perpetuity. It is known that during many long term CO2 geo-sequestration processes three will be parts of the underground reservoir subjected to cyclic CO2-brine flooding. The multiphase flow characteristics of the fluids-rock system can change after each flooding cycle or in other words each flooding stage would be different from the other from the multiphase flow behaviour point of view. This continual change is due to various factors including: the capillary hysteresis effect, chemical reactions between the in-site created solute and the host formation rock, the effect of the stress applied to the reservoir and any formation damage or enhancements caused by the CO2 or alternating CO2-brine injection process. To the authors' knowledge there has not been an extended experimental study conducted to date on the effects of such cyclic flooding pattern on the multiphase flow characteristics of the system for more than two flooding cycles. This paper presents in details the equipment, procedure, protocol and the results of an experimental work carried out to understand the change in supercritical CO2-brine-rock interactions subjected to this cyclic flooding pattern under in-situ reservoir conditions of pressure and temperature, with emphasis on change in multiphase flow characteristics of the system. The experiments were run on a number of sandstone samples with different permeability and porosity values to allow an evaluation of the change in experimental results with change in the sample properties. With this knowledge, we can better understand the significance of change in fluid flow characteristics during cyclic flooding which occurs in many CO2 geo-sequestration processes in one form or the other.

TI  - Getting rid of atmospheric carbon: Sequestration and air capture
AB  - Unlike alternative energy sources, or energy efficiency measures, carbon sequestration can only act to reduce CO2 atmospheric concentrations; it does not help solve our energy problems, and may even add to them. Several sequestration approaches are possible. Carbon capture and storage can only be applied to present emissions from large CO2 emitting sources such as power stations. Another possible approach is to capture CO2 directly from the air. Carbon sequestration in forests, soils, or in ocean plankton, are of this type, as is mechanical air capture. Mechanical air capture can in principle also draw down past CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, and even compensate for emissions of other greenhouse gases. However, the energy costs for capture are very high, so that energy availability becomes a problem. The sequestration phase is the same as for CO2 from fossil fuel combustion. Sequestering CO2 in the deep ocean would lead to both ocean acidification and adverse consequences for marine life. Estimates for the quantity of CO2 that can be ultimately sequestered in geological formations such as disused oil and gas fields, and saline aquifers, both on land and in the seabed, vary by orders of magnitude. But such estimates may be beside the point, since sequestration requires not only that adequate safe geological storage capacity be available, but that CO2 can be safely introduced at the rate desired, which could amount worldwide to tens of Gigatonne of CO2 per year. Furthermore, there is a small risk of catastrophic blowout from injection wells, which means that local citizen opposition could be intense.

TI  - Assessment of the ability of mangrove structures for attenuation of coastal wave energy: A case study in Bac Lieu Province, Vietnam
AB  - Mangrove forests play an important role in coastal disaster mitigation as a natural measure by dissipating wave energy, which performance would change according to mangrove structures, including mangrove density, tree height, root height and tree diameter. This study was aimed at assessing the wave energy dissipating function in terms of mangrove structures and determining the necessary thickness of the mangrove forest to reduce the impacts of waves on the Bac Lieu coastal zone, Vietnam. Standard plots with the unit distance of 20 m mangrove were set for each transect, ranging from the seaside edge of mangrove to 100 m distance inland. Properties of mangrove structures were measured at three transects to ensure the representation of the study area. Waves were measured along the transects using wave gauges and characteristics of wave attenuation due to the drag force of one existing mangrove species, Avicennia sp., were analyzed. The density, height and diameter of mangrove trees were found to be distributed relatively evenly, with a slight increase of the number of trees per standard plot from 183 at the seaside edge to 218 at the 100 m distance inland. Regarding mangrove root, while its density was relatively uniform along transects, its height varied significantly. The amplitude of wave in the Bac Lieu coastal zone changed substantially with the tidal phase ranging from 0.09 to 0.22 m. The wave reduction between the seaside edge and 20 m and 100 m distances inland from the edge, respectively, increased from 32 % to 91 %. A number of mangroves characteristics influenced the rate of reduction of wave height per unit distance, most notably the physical structures of mangrove trees, especially their densities. The wave reduction coefficient was positively correlated with the thickness of mangroves (r = 0.96). When the distance of wave energy transmission through mangroves was greater or equal to approximately 76 m, the wave energy reduction reached 80 % or above, which assures the wave energy would not influence the coastal zone. Therefore, in Bac Lieu with dense mangrove trees, a thin band of mangroves could provide an adequate defense to protect the coastal area in this tidal range under normal wave conditions. However, for the case of storms with high waves and surges, more thickness of mangroves would be required to guarantee the protection function, which should be analyzed in future studies.

TI  - Carbon remineralization in the Amazon-Guianas tropical mobile mudbelt: A sedimentary incinerator
AB  - The Amazon River spawns a vast mobile mudbelt extending similar to 1600 km from the equator to the Orinoco delta. Deposits along the Amazon-Guianas coastline are characterized by some of the highest C-org remineralization rates reported for estuarine, deltaic, or shelf deposits, however, paradoxically, except where stabilized by mangroves or intertidal algal mats, they are usually suboxic and nonsulfidic. A combination of tides, wind-driven waves, and coastal currents forms massive fluid muds and mobile surface sediment layers similar to 0.5-2m, thick which are dynamically refluxed and frequently reoxidized. Overall, the seabed functions as a periodically mixed batch reactor, efficiently remineralizing organic matter in a gigantic sedimentary incinerator of global importance. Amazon River material entering the head of this dynamic dispersal system carries an initial terrestrial sedimentary Corg loading of similar to 0.7 mg Cm-2 particle surface area. Total C-org loading is lowered to similar to 0.2 mg Cm-2 in the proximal delta topset, similar to 60-70\% of which remains of terrestrial origin. Loading decreases further to 0.12-0.14 mg Cm-2 (similar to 60\% terrestrial) in mudbanks similar to 600 km downdrift along French Guiana, values comparable to those found in the oligotrophic deepsea. DOC/Sigma CO2 ratios in pore waters of French Guiana mudbanks indicate that > 90\% of metabolized organic substrates are completely oxidized. Within the Amazon delta topset at the head of the dispersal system, both terrestrial and marine organic matter contribute substantially to early diagenetic remineralization, although reactive marine substrate dominates (similar to 60-70\%). The conditional rate constant for terrestrial C-org in the delta topset is similar to 0.2 a(-1). As sedimentary C-org is depleted during transit, marine sources become virtually the exclusive substrate for remineralization except very near the mangrove shoreline. The delta C-13 and Delta C-14 values of pore water Sigma CO2 in mudbanks demonstrate that the primary source of remineralized organic matter within similar to 1 km of shore is a small quantity of bomb signature marine plankton (+ 80 parts per thousand). Thus, fresh marine organic material is constantly entrained into mobile deposits and increasingly drives early diagenetic reactions along the transit path. Relatively refractory terrestrial C-org is lost more slowly but steadily during sedimentary refluxing and suboxic diagenesis. Amazon Fan deposits formed during low sea level stand largely bypassed this suboxic sedimentary incinerator and stored material with up to similar to 3X the modern high stand inner shelf C-org load (Keil et al., 1997b. Proceedings of the Ocean Drilling Program, Scientific Results. Vol. 155. pp. 531-537). Sedimentary dynamics, including frequency and magnitude of remobilization, and the nature of dispersal systems are clearly key controls on diagenetic processes, biogeochemical cycling, and global C storage along the continental margins.

TI  - Economic value of aboveground mangrove biomass carbon storage in Sonora, Mexico
AB  - Introduction: Mangroves provide environmental goods and services that mitigate climate change. Objective: To estimate the economic value of the carbon stock in the aboveground biomass of mangroves in Bahia del Tobari (BT) and El Sargento in Sonora. Materials and methods: Field research were conducted in 2014 and 2015 in 16 plots (10 x 10 m). Biomass of Laguncularia racemosa (L.) Gaertn, Rhizophora mangle L. and Avicennia germinans (L.) L. was determined with specific allometric equations. Carbon stocks and avoided CO2e emissions were estimated with conversion factors 0.5 and 3.7, respectively; these data represented the 2015 baseline. The 2020 estimates included changes in mangrove cover. The economic value was determined using the marginal carbon abatement cost method. Results and discussion: The 2015 baseline indicated reserves of 52.1 MgC.ha(-1) and 191.2 tCO(2)e.ha(-1) for BT, and 71.7 MgC.ha(-1) and 263.2 tCO(2)e.ha(-1) for El Sargento. By 2020 avoided emissions of 69368.2 tCO(2)e.TA(-1) (TA = 362.79 ha) were estimated for BT and 116696 tCO(2)e.TA(-1) (TA = 468.32 ha) for El Sargento. Economic values of these emissions were 131799.5 USD (World Bank) and 180 357.2 USD (voluntary carbon market) for BT and 221722.2 USD (World Bank) and 303409.4 USD (voluntary carbon market) for El Sargento. Conclusions: The highest estimates of C reserves and economic value were recorded at El Sargento. Compared to other studies in the region, both sites had higher avoided CO(2)e emissions.

TI  - Dissolved iron supply limits early growth of estuarine mangroves
AB  - Three mesocosm experiments were performed in an outdoor facility to quantify the responses of five mangrove species grown from seedling to sapling stage to increasing rates of dissolved iron supply. Stem extension and biomass of mangroves were measured in the first two experiments, and in the third experiment, rates of microbial iron reduction were measured in relation to stem extension of two mangrove species. In all experiments, mangrove growth was enhanced by increasing iron supply, although some species showed iron toxicity at the higher supply rates. In the first two experiments, stem extension rates of Rhizophora apiculata, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, and Xylocarpus moluccensis best fit Gaussian curves with maximal growth at supply rates of 50-60 mmol Fe.m(-2).d(-1), whereas growth of Avicennia marina and Ceriops tagal increased to the highest rate (100 mmol Fe.m(-2).d(-1)) of iron supply. Changes in leaf chlorophyll concentrations and iron content of roots mirrored the growth responses. In the third experiment, rates of microbial iron reduction were greater with R. apiculata and A. marina than in controls without plants; for both species, there was a positive relationship between stem extension and iron reduction. The rates of iron reduction and rates of iron supplied to the plants were well within the range of interstitial iron concentrations and rates of iron reduction found in the natural mangrove soils from which the seedlings were obtained. The responses of these species show that mangroves growing from seedling to sapling stage have a strong nutritional requirement for iron, and that there is a close relationship between plant roots and the activities of iron-reducing bacteria. These results suggest that mangrove growth may be limited in some natural forests by the rate at which iron is solubilized by iron-reducing bacteria. Such biogeochemical conditions have significant implications for successful recruitment, establishment, and early growth of mangroves.

TI  - Extraction of carbon dioxide from seawater by strong base anion exchange resins
AB  - The ocean could be an important resource with regard to its total carbon dioxide content. The concentration of bound and dissolved carbon dioxide in the ocean is about 140 times greater than that found in air. Thus if carbon can be economically extracted from the ocean as a part of a marine engineering process such Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC), carbon reduction chemistry could be proposed as a way to utilize this carbon as a potential chemical feedstock for the production of liquid hydrocarbon fuel. Our laboratory is focusing efforts to increase the rate and yield of carbon dioxide recovery from the sea. One avenue of exploration is the use of strong base anion exchange resins. It is well known that these resins work on the principle of exchanging hydroxide ions for anions. Ion exchange resins offer several advantages for this particular application, because in general they are inexpensive, durable, and can be operated at high flow rates in various water media. In addition the selectivity of the resin can be tailored by using mixed beds or specific functionalized groups upon resin synthesis. This presentation will discuss the direct recovery of bicarbonate ion from seawater using different strong base ion exchange resins. In efforts to optimize and implement these systems, batch and column processes were used to determine resin bicarbonate and chloride selectivities, exchange rates, ionic strength effects on bicarbonate selectivity, and thermal regeneration schemes for liberation of sequestered bicarbonate as carbon dioxide.

TI  - Understanding the significance of in situ coal properties on CO2 sequestration
AB  - Over the years, the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere has increased extensively. There has been an increase of CO 2 concentrations in atmosphere from 280ppm in 1850 to 360ppm in 1998. Therefore, methods such as carbon sequestration, increased conservation or to consume less carbon intensive fuels by switching to alternative energy sources such as wind, solar, nuclear, and tidal power are suggested. However, alternative green energy resources such as solar energy and geothermal energy are not adequate to substitute fossil fuels. Therefore, the dependency on fossil fuels may not reduce in the foreseeable future. The CO2 sequestration is an attractive method especially in terms of coal with the potential benefits attached with CH4 recovery. However, the potential of CO2 sequestration is not understood especially for various types of coals and also due to important in situ properties. In this study, data from previous studies are compared in terms of coal permeability, moisture content, cleat compressibility, ash content and by temperature with the CO2 adsorption content to understand the significance of these in situ coal properties on CO2 sequestration.

TI  - Approaches for CO2 capture and sequestration inspired by biological systems
AB  - In this study, several process alternatives for the permanent sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) as solid carbonates are evaluated. Although the formation of mineral carbonates is thermodynamically favourable, it does not occur significantly due to kinetic limitations and the formation of products that hinder the evolution of the process. Several biological organisms, including corals, have developed different mechanisms for accelerating the process and managing undesirable products. In this report, we propose biomimicking approaches to precipitate solid carbonates while limiting the amount of energy required or using the produced by-products to generate valuable materials. A few processes alternatives are described and evaluated in this study. In all these explored cases CO2 mineralization requires divalent cations such as Ca++ or Mg++. These could be sourced from sea water or land based silicates containing these cations. Sea-water based source results in two attractive options, namely: 1. electrochemically assisted precipitation of carbonates with production of sales of Cl2 or HCl; 2. electrochemically assisted precipitation of carbonates and production of Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) and polymerization into Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), with sales of PVC; the land based source results in further in options 3, and 4: 3. electrochemically assisted precipitation of carbonates with in-situ mining of silicates; and 4. ammonia assisted precipitation of carbonates with in-situ mining of silicates. This study explores the technical feasibility of these options further. Copyright 2016, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - Clam farming generates CO2: A study case in the Marinetta lagoon (Italy)
AB  - Respiration and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) production by the farmed short-neck clam Ruditapes philippinarum were calculated to assess their importance as carbon dioxide (CO2) sink/source in a lagoon of the Po Delta River (Italy). Biomass and calcimass were established by monthly harvests during a 1-year period (2009). The ratio of CO2 released to CaCO3 precipitated was calculated as a function of the near-bottom temperature. From our estimates, R. philippinarum sequestered 8.18molCO2m-2year-1 for shell formation, but the CO2 fluxes due to respiration and calcification resulted 22.7 and 5.56 molCO2m-2year-1, respectively. Clam farming seems therefore to be a significant additional source of CO2 to seawater. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Ironing Out Fe Residence Time in the Dynamic Upper Ocean
AB  - Although iron availability has been shown to limit ocean productivity and influence marine carbon cycling, the rates of processes driving iron's removal and retention in the upper ocean are poorly constrained. Using(234)Th- and sediment-trap data, most of which were collected through international GEOTRACES efforts, we perform an unprecedented observation-based assessment of iron export from and residence time in the upper ocean. The majority of these new residence time estimates for total iron in the surface ocean (0-250 m) fall between 10 and 100 days. The upper ocean residence time of dissolved iron, on the other hand, varies and cycles on sub-annual to annual timescales. Collectively, these residence times are shorter than previously thought, and the rates and timescales presented here will contribute to ongoing efforts to integrate iron into global biogeochemical models predicting climate and carbon dioxide sequestration in the ocean in the 21st century and beyond.

TI  - Mangrove production and carbon sinks: A revision of global budget estimates
AB  - Mangrove forests are highly productive but globally threatened coastal ecosystems, whose role in the carbon budget of the coastal zone has long been debated. Here we provide a comprehensive synthesis of the available data on carbon fluxes in mangrove ecosystems. A reassessment of global mangrove primary production from the literature results in a conservative estimate of similar to 218 +/- 72 Tg C a(-1). When using the best available estimates of various carbon sinks (organic carbon export, sediment burial, and mineralization), it appears that > 50\% of the carbon fixed by mangrove vegetation is unaccounted for. This unaccounted carbon sink is conservatively estimated at similar to 112 +/- 85 Tg C a(-1), equivalent in magnitude to similar to 30-40\% of the global riverine organic carbon input to the coastal zone. Our analysis suggests that mineralization is severely underestimated, and that the majority of carbon export from mangroves to adjacent waters occurs as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). CO2 efflux from sediments and creek waters and tidal export of DIC appear to be the major sinks. These processes are quantitatively comparable in magnitude to the unaccounted carbon sink in current budgets, but are not yet adequately constrained with the limited published data available so far.

TI  - United Kingdom: CCS, marine power in line for big boosts under Tories
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) and marine energy would be two key beneficiaries of a UK change in government, according to shadow energy minister Stephen Hendry. If the conservatives were to win the general election in 2010, they would provide funding to enable the construction of three or more new power plants with a combined capacity of up to 5 Gw that would feature CCS technology across the whole or part of the plant's output. Ronald Oxburgh, former chairman of Shell and a prominent consultant on energy and CCS, is heading a team, which is currently investigating any remaining obstacles to large-scale installation of CCS at power plants, such as providing the infrastructure for transporting sequestered CO2 to depleted gas fields and other suitable storage sites. Other technologies a Conservative government would nurture include marine and tidal power, energy from waste, microgeneration, and nuclear power. Wind power would receive a boost with the installation of new high-voltage DC power lines, which would sit on the sea bed along the east and west coast of the UK. All these renewable and low-carbon technologies will not come cheap, and Hendry urged greater transparency on the cost of decarbonizing future energy supplies. All sources of low-carbon power are very expensive and prices per unit of energy will rise. Hendry proposed making available Â£6500 of government support per house in the UK to improve the 60% of the UK's housing stock that is not properly insulated. That would make a dramatic difference to energy efficiency.

TI  - Effectiveness of CO2 sequestration in pre- and post-industrial oceans
AB  - Ocean carbon cycle modeling is expected to play a key role in decisions concerning the purposeful sequestration of CO2 in the oceans. Modeling is probably the only practical way to know how much good sequestration is doing, or would do if implemented, since even with sequestration, atmospheric CO2 would be expected to continue to increase because of the release of non- sequestered CO2 and the return to the atmosphere of sequestered CO2. We have employed a carbon cycle model based on an ocean general circulation model to estimate the return of sequestered CO2 to the atmosphere for sequestration in the pre-industrial ocean at sites near Tokyo, San Francisco, New York and Miami. Significant differences in the effectiveness of sequestration are found. Off the East Coast of the USA, the atmospheric concentration due to the return of sequestered CO2 quickly rises to near the final equilibrium value, for all depths below about 800 m. Off the West Coast of the USA, and the CO2 is effectively hidden from the atmosphere for several hundred years, for depths below 800 m. Then the atmospheric concentration rises to larger values than for sequestration off the East Coast. Sequestration off the coast of Japan at 800 m is similar to sequestration off the West Coast of the USA, but without the time delay. These predicted differences are understandable in terms of ocean circulation. Sequestration in the post-industrial ocean beginning in the year 2000 has been modeled also and sites near Tokyo and New York. This calculation includes additional CO2 from a representation of anthropogenic CO2 for the entire fossil fuel era. No-sequestered CO2 tends to flush the sequestered CO2 out of the ocean by reducing the concentration of the carbonate ion, with which CO2 reacts. Results are less favorable in the post-industrial ocean. The pre-industrial ocean model can help in the selection of location and depth, but the post-industrial ocean model is more realistic. 'Thus human beings are now carrying out a large scale geophysical experiment of a kind that could not have happened in the past nor be reproduced in the future. Within a few centuries we are returning to the atmosphere and oceans the concentrated organic carbon stored in sedimentary rocks over hundreds of years' Roger Revelle and Hans Suess. A carbon cycle model based on an ocean general circulation model has been used to estimate the return of sequestered CO2 to the atmosphere for sequestration in the pre-industrial ocean at sites near Tokyo, San Francisco, New York and Miami.

TI  - Storage and recycling of major and trace element in mangroves
AB  - The role of mangroves in sequestering metal and nutrients in sediment has been described in the past, but knowl-edge gaps still exist on storage capacity and recycling fluxes of elements in plant biomass, notably concerning their magnitude in root uptake and loss by litterfall. This study addresses the storage and transport pathways of 16 elements, classified as macro-nutrients (Ca, Mg, Na, K), micro-nutrients (Fe, Mn, Ni, Co, Cu, Cr, Zn, Mo), and potential toxicants (Al, Cd, Sn, Pb) in the world's largest mangroves, the Sundarbans. Elemental concentra-tions in plant organs were generally lower than in the sediment. The stock of macro and micro-nutrients in plant biomass varied from 60 to 2717 and 0.003 to 37.7 Mg ha(-1) respectively, with highest values observed for Na and lowest for Cd. The Avicennia species exhibited the maximal accumulation of all elements. Translocation of major elements to different plant organs increased with increasing their concentrations in the sediment. Ele-mental loss via litterfall indicated that Sundarbans mangrove could act as a source, particularly of Mn, to the Bay of Bengal. Moreover, belowground uptake of the 16 elements showed 2-3 fold higher fluxes than their loss via litterfall. There was a significant retention of some trace elements (notably Mo, Cd, and Sn) in plant biomass, which might allow one to use these mangroves for phytoremediation and restoration purposes. We conclude that mangroves efficiently store and remobilize major and trace elements from the sediments by root uptake and recycle back to sediment surface via litterfall. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Biogeochemical consequences of a changing Arctic shelf seafloor ecosystem
AB  - Unprecedented and dramatic transformations are occurring in the Arctic in response to climate change, but academic, public, and political discourse has disproportionately focussed on the most visible and direct aspects of change, including sea ice melt, permafrost thaw, the fate of charismatic megafauna, and the expansion of fisheries. Such narratives disregard the importance of less visible and indirect processes and, in particular, miss the substantive contribution of the shelf seafloor in regulating nutrients and sequestering carbon. Here, we summarise the biogeochemical functioning of the Arctic shelf seafloor before considering how climate change and regional adjustments to human activities may alter its biogeochemical and ecological dynamics, including ecosystem function, carbon burial, or nutrient recycling. We highlight the importance of the Arctic benthic system in mitigating climatic and anthropogenic change and, with a focus on the Barents Sea, offer some observations and our perspectives on future management and policy.

TI  - Review of geoengineering approaches to mitigating climate change
AB  - Geoengineering, which is the intentional large-scale manipulation of the environment, has been suggested as an effective means of mitigating global warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, we will review and assess technical and theoretical aspects of land-based, atmosphere-based, ocean-based and space-based geoengineering schemes as well as their potential impacts on global climate and ecosystem. Most of the proposed geoengineering schemes carried out on land or in the ocean are to use physical, chemical or biological approaches to remove atmospheric CO2. These schemes are able to only sequester an amount of atmospheric CO2 that is small compared with cumulative anthropogenic emissions. Most of geoengineering schemes carried out in the atmosphere or space are based on increasing planetary albedo. These schemes have relatively low costs and short lead times for technical implementation, and can act rapidly to reduce temperature anomalies caused by greenhouse gas emissions. The costs and benefits of geoengineering are likely to vary spatially over the planet with some countries and regions gaining considerably while others may be faced with a worse set of circumstances than would be the case without geoengineering. Since current research on geoengineering is limited and various international treaties may limit some geoengineering experiments in the real world, the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP) provides a framework of coordinated experiments for all earth system modeling groups to test geoengineering schemes. However, these experiments used on a global scale have difficulty with accurate resolution of regional and local impacts, so future research on geoengineering is expect to be done by combining earth system models with regional climate models.

TI  - Dispersion of carbon dioxide bubble release from shallow subsea carbon dioxide storage to seawater
AB  - A large amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas injected into shallow reservoirs of carbon capture and storage (CCS) system could be hazardous to marine life if the CO2 released through the seabed. Effective dispersion model is required to assess the realistic exposure as it affects the partial pressure of CO2 and pH of seawater. Here, the development of the dispersion model based on CFD FLUENT that integrates chemical reaction of CO2 bubble in seawater plume is discussed. The capability of the developed model has been demonstrated through a comparison of simulation results with published small-scale field experimental data. Parametric simulation has been conducted to investigate the impact of release rate, current velocity and release size on the dispersion of CO2 gas-seawater. The study confirmed that high release rate in low tide (and low current) condition has the most severe impact. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Effect of mangrove biochar on methane production, oxidation and emission of rice cultivation in clay loam soil
AB  - Biochar is recommended as soil amendment to CH4 emissions from rice growing. However, CH4 mitigation mechanisms are not well known. This study aimed to evaluate the changes of CH4 production, oxidation and emission of rice cultivation soil that was amended by mangrove biochar to explain the mitigation way. Biochar at rate equivalent to 10 t haâ€“1 was thoroughly mixed with clay loam soil within the 0.32 m3 bucket on 16th d before rice was sown under greenhouse condition. The redox potential (Eh), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), sulfate (SO42â€“) and nitrate (NO3â€“) of soil and CH4 emission were measured throughout cultivation season, while abundances of methanogens and methanotrophs and activities of CH4 production and oxidation were determined from soil that collected in two critical stages (tillering and heading) of rice growth. The results show that biochar enhanced soil oxidation capacity through increasing soil Eh (ranging of 11â€“26 mV) and major electron acceptors (average of 77.3 % in SO42â€“ and 42.1 % in NO3â€“) throughout rice growth period. It also enhanced soil DOC in the most stages of rice cultivation. These effects did not influence the significant change of CH4 producer (methanogenic archaea) and CH4 production activity as compared to no amendment soil. A high porosity and surface area of mangrove biochar stimulated CH4 consumer (methanotrophic bacteria), resulting in enhanced CH4 oxidation activity by 11.8 % in tillering stage and 34.4 % in heading stage. This greater CH4 oxidation activity influenced the significant reduction of seasonal CH4 emission by 24.5 %. A major factor of CH4 emissions mitigation from rice cultivation by biochar amendment is the increment of CH4 oxidation particularly during heading stage. Copyright Â© 2021, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

TI  - Temporal variability of CO2 fluxes at the sediment-air interface in mangroves (New Caledonia)
AB  - Carbon budgets in mangrove forests are uncertain mainly due to the lack of data concerning carbon export in dissolved and gaseous forms. Temporal variability of in situ CO2 fluxes was investigated at the sediment-air interface in different seasons in different mangrove stands in a semi-arid climate. Fluxes were measured using dynamic closed incubation chambers (transparent and opaque) connected to an infra-red gas analyzer. Microclimatic conditions and chl-a contents of surface sediments were determined. Over all mangrove stands, CO2 fluxes on intact sediments were relatively low, ranging from -3.93 to 8.85 mmolCO2Â·m-2Â·h-1 in the light and in the dark, respectively. Changes in the fluxes over time appeared to depend to a great extent on the development of the biofilm at the sediment surface. We suggest that in intact sediments and in the dark, CO2 fluxes measured at the sediment-air interface rather reflect the metabolism of benthic organisms than sediment respiration (heterotrophic and autotrophic). However, without the biofilm, sediment water content and air temperature were main drivers of seasonal differences in CO2 fluxes, and their influence differed depending on the intertidal location of the stand. After removal of the biofilm, Q10 values in the Avicennia and the Rhizophora stands were 1.84 and 2.1, respectively, revealing the sensitivity of mangrove sediments to an increase in temperature. This study provides evidence that, if the influence of the biofilm is not taken into account, the in situ CO2 emission data currently used to calculate the budget will lead to underestimation of CO2 production linked to heterotrophic respiration fueled by organic matter detritus from the mangrove.

TI  - Net loss statistics underestimate carbon emissions from mangrove land use and land cover change
AB  - Converting mangroves to other land cover types can induce large emissions of carbon dioxide, depending on the type of land use and land cover (LULC) change. However, mangroves may also recover their ecosystem carbon stocks rapidly following restoration, potentially offsetting carbon stock losses. While studies have quantified these tradeoffs at global scales using coarse metrics, fewer studies have quantified them at national scales at higher resolution. Here, we used high-resolution data sets of LULC for mangroves in Thailand to quantify district-level gross and net changes in mangrove carbon stocks from ~1960 to 2014. We found emissions based on gross gain and loss statistics (7.18 Â± 0.24 million Mg C) to be greater than those associated with emissions based on net area change statistics (1.65 Â± 0.26 million Mg C) by a factor of four. The difference in estimates arises from slower rates of carbon stock recovery following reforestation relative to carbon stock loss following LULC change. Overall, we found the greatest gains in mangrove carbon stocks to be from mangrove expansion in areas of accreting sediments, which were strongly correlated with district-level extent of undisturbed mangroves. Our results show that net loss statistics may greatly underestimate emissions associated with LULC change in mangroves. Additionally, our findings suggest that gains in mangrove carbon stocks associated with natural establishment at the periphery of standing mangroves may offset substantial carbon stock losses at national scales.

TI  - Research on the Delimitation of Marine Spatial Pattern Based on the Goal of ``Carbon Peaking and Carbon Neutrality{''
AB  - In the context of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality ({''}double carbon{''}), it is urgent to clarify the effect of marine spatial planning (MSP) on carbon sink increases and emission reductions, since such planning acts as a spatial governance tool for the earth's largest carbon pool. In this paper, a linkage model between marine spatial functional zones and carbon distribution is established. To explore the relationship between marine spatial functional zones and carbon, the study analyzed the carbon increase or reduction role of sea-use activities in each zone and considered the carbon sequestration function of the marine ecosystem itself. A marine spatial pattern of ``Two Spaces and Four Carbon Areas{''} is proposed to present the linkage. A carbon distribution pattern in marine space is delimited using the linkage model and the current MSP in the case study of the city of Tangshan, Hebei, China. Some measures have been taken or planned to be taken in Tangshan to improve the carbon sink function of the ecosystem and the marine space. The supporting role of MSP in achieving the ``double carbon{''} goal is studied, and the paths and suggestions for integrating the ``double carbon{''} goal into MSP are explored.

TI  - Legal liability for carbon capture and storage in Australia: Where should the losses fall?
AB  - This article presents a critical analysis of the current and proposed CCS legal frameworks across a number of jurisdictions in Australia in order to examine the legal treatment of the risks of carbon leakage from CCS operations. It does so through an analysis of the statutory obligations and liability rules established under the offshore Commonwealth and Victorian regimes, and onshore Queensland and Victorian legislative frameworks. Exposure draft legislation for CCS laws in Western Australia is also examined. In considering where the losses will fall in the event of leakage, the potential tortious and statutory liabilities of private operators and the State are addressed alongside the operation of statutory protections from liability. The current legal treatment of CCS under the new Australian Carbon Pricing Mechanism is also critiqued.

TI  - Carbon capture and storage: Lessons from a storage potential and localization analysis
AB  - The challenges of climate change involve totally rethinking the world's energy system. In particular, CCS technologies are still presented as a solution to reach ambitious climate targets. However, avoiding the required Gt of CO2 emissions by investing in CCS technologies supposes the development of carbon storage capacities. This analysis, conducted with TIAM-FR and based on a wide review of geological storage potential and various data, aims to discuss the impact of this potential on the development of the CCS option. We also specify a scenario allowing the exclusion of onshore storage due to a hypothetic policy considering public resistance to onshore storage, and carbon transport costs variation effects. The implementation of CCS is less impacted by the level of carbon storage potential - except in the lowest case of availability - than by the type of sequestration site. However, the development of CCS is lower at the end of the period in the case of a decrease in carbon storage potential. Indeed, the question of type of storage site appears to have a greater impact, with an arbitrage between deep saline aquifers and depleted basins and enhanced recovery. Doubling the cost of carbon transport does not limit the penetration of carbon capture technologies, but it does impact the choice of site. Finally, a limitation of onshore storage could have a significant impact on the penetration of the CCS option. The explanation for this limited deployment of CCS is thus the higher cost of offshore storage more than the level of storage potential. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - New energy efficient CO2 pressurization strategies for enhanced oil recovery applications
AB  - CO2 compression is considered as one of the challenges in CO2 capture and sequestration (CCS). In enhanced oil recovery (EOR) applications where CO2 is pressurized to supercritical pressure (e.g. 150 bar) before injection into a well, CO2 compression could reduce natural gas combined cycle power plants net power by about 4%. In this paper, several CO2 pressurization strategies, such as compression or liquefaction and pumping using an open cycle or closed cycles, were explored and evaluated. New CO2 liquefaction cycles based on single refrigerant and cascade refrigerants were developed and modeled using HYSYS software. The developed models were validated against experimental data. The considered refrigerants for CO2 liquefaction are NH2, CO2, C3H8 and R134a. One of the developed vapor compression CO2 liquefaction cycles that use NH3 as a refrigerant at an optimized liquefaction pressure resulted in 5.1% less power consumption than the conventional multi-stage compression cycle as well as 27.7% less power consumption than the open CO2 liquefaction cycle. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to explore the effect of heat exchangers pressure drop, compressors isentropic efficiency and seawater temperature on the power savings. The results show that the developed liquefaction cycle outperforms the conventional multi-stage compression cycle in almost all cases explored.

Stored carbon in a coral reef-type mangrove habitat consisting of a 2 m thick mangrove peat layer, which is a type of mangrove habitat in tropical Pacific islands, was estimated at 1300 t C ha(-1). The carbon burial rate during the phase of gradual sea-level rise, which was calculated at 93 g m(-2) year(-1) between 1800 and 1380 years sp using the medians of the radiocarbon ages, was significantly higher than that between 1380 years sp and present in a stable sea-level phase.

TI  - Sulfate precipitation during CO2 sequestration in carbonate rock
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been proposed to mitigate the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. Water alternating gas (WAG) technique is used in the industry to inject CO2 into underground formations either in sequestration or in EOR. CO2 dissolves in water, generating carbonic acid, which dissolves carbonate rock. The composition of the water is a critical factor that affects the rock permeability during sequestration. Sulfate content of the injected water can cause precipitation of calcium sulfate, which can negatively affect the rock permeability. This paper addresses potential formation damage due to sulfate precipitation during CO 2 sequestration. A core flood study was conducted using limestone cores. CO2 was injected at pressure greater than 1300 psi and temperatures (70 and 200Â°F). CO2 and brines were injected in WAG cycles under injection rates of 2 and 5 cm3/min. Seawater and formation brine were examined in this study. Core effluent samples were collected and concentrations of calcium and sulfate ions were measured to assess calcium sulfate precipitation. Core permeability was measured before and after the experiment. The results show that temperature is the main parameter that affects sulfate precipitation during CO2 sequestration. Injection rate doesn't have a significant effect on the core permeability. At high salinity calcium sulfate precipitation occurs even with low sulfate concentration present.

TI  - Biomass and carbon estimation for scrub mangrove forests and examination of their allometric associated uncertainties
AB  - Reliable estimates of biomass and carbon storage are essential for the understanding of the environmental drivers and processes that regulate the productivity of scrub forests. The present study estimated total (above-ground, AGB + below-ground, BGB) biomass and carbon storage of a scrub forest dominated by Avicennia germinans (L.) L. based on the existing allometric models for the AGB, while novel models were developed to estimate the BGB. Data collection followed a destructive approach by using the "sampling method", from 45 trees divided into three height classes. Tree height and diameter were used to estimate the BGB of these forests, providing more accurate estimates of their biomass. Our findings indicate the existence of a direct relationship with increasing topography and interstitial salinity, which result in an increase in the percentage contribution of the AGB. By contrast, increasing topography also led to reduction in tree height and contribution of the BGB, although this compartment represents approximately half of the total biomass of these forests. The contribution of BGB estimates increased from 43 to 49.5% from the lowest to the highest height class and the BGB and AGB values reached approximately 87 Mg ha-1 (48.6%) and 91.7 Mg ha-1 (51.4%), respectively. The estimates of the biomass and carbon stocks of scrub mangroves vary considerably worldwide, which reflects the uncertainties derived from the application of distinct sampling methods. Specific models developed for each height class should be considered instead generalist models to reduce the general uncertainties on the production and distribution of biomass and the storage of carbon. Overall, our results overcome a major lacuna in the development of allometric equations to estimate the production of BGB and the storage of carbon by scrub mangrove forests, contributing to the refinement of the total biomass estimates for this type of mangrove forest.

TI  - Quantification of blue carbon pathways contributing to negative feedback on climate change following glacier retreat in West Antarctic fjords
AB  - Global warming is causing significant losses of marine ice around the polar regions. In Antarctica, the retreat of tidewater glaciers is opening up novel, low-energy habitats (fjords) that have the potential to provide a negative feedback loop to climate change. These fjords are being colonized by organisms on and within the sediment and act as a sink for particulate matter. So far, blue carbon potential in Antarctic habitats has mainly been estimated using epifaunal megazoobenthos (although some studies have also considered macrozoobenthos). We investigated two further pathways of carbon storage and potential sequestration by measuring the concentration of carbon of infaunal macrozoobenthos and total organic carbon (TOC) deposited in the sediment. We took samples along a temporal gradient since time of last glacier ice cover (1â€“1000Â years) at three fjords along the West Antarctic Peninsula. We tested the hypothesis that seabed carbon standing stock would be mainly driven by time since last glacier covered. However, results showed this to be much more complex. Infauna were highly variable over this temporal gradient and showed similar total mass of carbon standing stock per m2 as literature estimates of Antarctic epifauna. TOC mass in the sediment, however, was an order of magnitude greater than stocks of infaunal and epifaunal carbon and increased with time since last ice cover. Thus, blue carbon stocks and recent gains around Antarctica are likely much higher than previously estimated as is their negative feedback on climate change. Â© 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Engineering pipelines for transportation of Co2 with impurities
AB  - Pipeline transportation of carbon dioxide (CO2) dates back to the early 1970's with the construction of the Canyon Reef Carriers &amp; Val Verde pipeline in Texas USA. Since that time about 7200 kilometers of CO 2 pipeline have been built in North America (mostly in the USA), some in Asia (Turkey) and Africa and one offshore Europe. The experience of such pipelines is predominantly for the transportation of naturally occurring and relatively pure CO2 for the purpose of enhanced oil recovery (EOR). With international concern over global warming and concerns over greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, various carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) initiatives are becoming viable options for managing manmade industrial greenhouse gases, forecasted to rise to about 44, 000 million metric tonnes by 2030, Mohitpour 2008. The impurities can significantly affect the CO2 phase diagram, influencing pipeline capacity, fracture control properties and most importantly pipeline operation and emergency response related to release and dispersion of CO2 and toxic impurities such as H2S. This paper will provide a first hand view of salient design features of pipeline transportation of CO2 containing impurities typical of those captured from flue stacks. It will provide general guidance and a basis for design, construction and operation of pipelines transporting CO2 with impurities for sequestration and EOR. Copyright Â© 2010 by ASME.

TI  - Carbonation of silica cement at high-temperature well conditions
AB  - Cements for well environments with temperatures above 110 Â°C are typically designed with silica additions. This is the case for many of the wells in the North Sea, which is a region promising for large-scale geological storage of CO2 from European sources. Wells are probable leakage paths in carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects, and it is therefore important to understand how CO2 interacts with cement under downhole conditions. In this study, microstructural changes associated with carbonation of cement with and without silica were followed using micro-computed tomography, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The rims of the cement cores exposed to CO2-saturated brine consisted of a carbonated region and a bicarbonated region. In the silica cement sample, the carbonated region consisted of two distinct layers with a rough interface region containing wormhole-like features. The formation of these two layers in the silica cement is proposed to be due to calcium carbonate dissolution and re-precipitation during exposure to CO2-saturated brine. The results illustrate the importance of the effect of additives for offshore CO2-storage well integrity. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Investigation of high temperature, high pressure, scaling and dissolution effects for Carbon Capture and Storage at a high CO2 content carbonate gas field offshore Malaysia
AB  - Malaysia is considering Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) as a possible way to reduce its greenhouse gas emission footprint. An offshore carbonate reservoir has been identified in which all aspects of CCS are investigated in detail. There, the CO2 is planned to be re-injected into a saline aquifer. However, formation damage in underground formations linked with permeability reduction can significantly impact oil and gas production and could render CCS infeasible. Thus, in order to manage the injection of CO2 from the subsurface side a study was conducted investigating geomechanical aspects, rock fluid interactions as well as production aspects from the gas field. Only very few studies exist that investigate scaling and dissolution effects at elevated pressures and temperatures. Here, results from 3 high pressure high temperature scaling and dissolution core floods for the scheduled to be developed carbonate field are presented in detail. Core floods were performed under temperatures ranging between 121 Â°C to 136 Â°C and CaCO3 scaling tendencies between 0.24 and 1.47. The scaling tendency of each brine was adjusted to represent, baseline, assumed worst case scaling as well as worst case dissolution scenarios identified based on fluid and gas samples and prior geochemical modelling. Bicarbonate, Calcium and pH were analysed from samples taken during the core flood. SEM-EDX analysis was done on core flood effluent particles. A calcite dissolution rate of 0.008 mol/m2/sec was calculated for the core flood with the scaling tendency of 0.24. The specific surface area of the calcite was estimated at 0.17 cm2/mol. Overall the results indicate that only minor dissolution can be anticipated during production from the CO2 rich gas field. Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Seismic reservoir characterization of potential CO2 storage reservoir sandstones in Smeaheia area, Northern North Sea
AB  - Evaluating any subsurface CO2 storage site comprises the reservoir, seal, and overburden investigation to mitigate injection and storage-related complications. The Upper-Middle Jurassic Sognefjord, Fensfjord, and Krossfjord formation sandstones are potential CO2 storage reservoirs at the Smeaheia area, northern North Sea. The Smeaheia area is located east of the Troll oil and gas field. The Upper Jurassic organic-rich Heather and Draupne Formation shales are the main seals for the sandstone reservoirs. In this study, we carried out a prestack seismic inversion to obtain elastic property cubes of acoustic impedance (AI), velocity ratio (Vp/Vs), and bulk density (RhoB). From these elastic cubes, we obtained the reservoir properties such as porosity (Phi), shaliness (Vsh), and permeability (k) of Sognefjord, Fensfjord, and Krossfjord formations. We introduced two new equations to extract the shale volume and porosity cubes from the inverted elastic cubes in the present study. These equations are nonlinear based on the AI versus Vp/Vs rock physics template. Both equations are correlated first with the well log data and then applied on the elastic property cubes (AI versus Vp/Vs) to obtain the Vsh and Phi property cubes. An additional porosity cube (PhiD) was generated from the inverted RhoB for comparison. Finally, using an empirical equation, permeability was extracted from the porosity cube. The reservoir properties we derived from 3D seismic, in addition to the well log, revealed the vertical and lateral variations of porosity, shaliness, and permeability in the Smeaheia area. We used these reservoir properties to infer the depositional environment and the viability of reservoirs for CO2 storage. The depositional environments identified were shoreface and deltaic from the extracted sand-body geometries. We found the Sognefjord Formation possessing the best reservoir properties, followed by the Fensfjord Formation as the secondary storage potential. In contrast, the Krossfjord Formation owed the lowest reservoir quality in the Smeaheia area. Â© 2021 The Author(s)

A discussion covers the role of the regional partnerships in conducting integrated field tests; suite of field tests being implemented during Phase II and Phase III of the program across the Southeast; development of an integrated carbon capture, separation and geologic storage pilot, known as the "Anthropogenic Test", during which CO2 will be captured at a stationary source and injected into a suitable deep saline formation; the lower Tuscaloosa Formation, one of many suitable carbon sequestration locations within the Gulf Coast Basin; mechanical integrity of wells; transportation infrastructure; long-term storage formations; and the impact of captured CO2 from power plants on the geochemistry of the saline water in the lower Tuscaloosa Formation.

TI  - The microbial carbon pump: From genes to ecosystems
AB  - The majority of marine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is resistant to biological degradation and thus can remain in the water column for thousands of years, constituting carbon sequestration in the ocean. To date the origin of such recalcitrant DOC (RDOC) is unclear. A recently proposed conceptual framework, the microbial carbon pump (MCP), emphasizes the microbial transformation of organic carbon from labile to recalcitrant states. The MCP is concerned with both microbial uptakes and outputs of DOC compounds, covering a wide range from gene to ecosystem levels. In this minireview, the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter is used as an example for the microbial processing of DOC at the genetic level. The compositions of the ABC transporter genes of the two major marine bacterial clades Roseobacter and SAR11 demonstrate that they have distinct patterns in DOC utilization: Roseobacter strains have the advantage of taking up carbohydrate DOC, while SAR11 bacteria prefer nitrogen-containing DOC. At the ecosystem level, bacterially derived RDOC based on D-amino acid biomarkers is reported to be responsible for about a quarter of the total marine RDOC pool. Under future global warming scenarios, partitioning of primary production into DOC could be enhanced, and thus the MCP could play an even more important role in carbon sequestration by the ocean. Joint efforts to study the MCP from multiple disciplines are required to obtain a better understanding of ocean carbon cycle and its coupling with global change.

TI  - Achieving negative emissions through oceanic sequestration of vegetation carbon as Black Pellets
AB  - Natural processes and human activities produce vast amounts of dead vegetation which return CO2 to the atmosphere through decay and combustion. If such vegetation could be converted into biocoal and sequestered on the ocean floor, it could reduce the accumulation of atmospheric CO2 without involving sequestration in the form of CO2. Given that raw vegetation is unsuitable for large-scale energy applications, a process was developed to convert raw vegetation into a form of biocoal, termed Black Pellets, that solves the logistical and energy conversion problems of using raw vegetation for power generation. Seemingly overlooked is that properties of Black Pelletsâ€”higher density than seawater and resistance to microbial decayâ€”may offer an environmentally safe way of sequestering vegetation carbon on the sea floor. Sequestering vegetation carbon by depositing biocoal as Black Pellets in the deep ocean (oceanic sequestration of biocoalâ€”OSB) would be a means of achieving long-lasting negative emissions. Sacrificing the energy content of the deposited pellets would require substituting energy from other sources. If the substitute energy could be from lower-carbon natural gas or carbon-free sources, the effects would be less accumulation of atmospheric CO2 compared to using the pellets for energy and a nearly 60 to 100% reduction in the need for geologic sequestration compared to bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS). If confirmed by research, OSB would be an addition to the sparse toolbox of negative emission technologies (NETs) which would give humankind more flexibility in meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement.

TI  - Quantifying shoot and root biomass production and soil carbon under perennial bioenergy grasses in a subtropical environment
AB  - Perennial bioenergy grasses can potentially replace fossil fuels and offset atmospheric CO2 through soil C sequestration. However, limited information relevant to the impacts of bioenergy cropping on ecosystem services, especially above-and below-ground productivity and soil C sequestration is available for subtropical environments (e.g., southeastern USA). The objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of perennial bioenergy cropping on C cycling and accumulation in the soil following four years of production in North Florida. Treatments consisted of six perennial grass species: giant reed, elephantgrass, energycane, sugarcane, sweetcane, and giant miscanthus. Elephantgrass, energycane, sweetcane, and sugarcane produced great shoot biomass (31-41 Mg ha(-1)) when harvested once per year. Giant reed's shoot biomass responded favorably to two harvests per year (27-43 Mg ha(-1)), whereas giant miscanthus did not perform well in any of the years (9-21 Mg ha(-1)). Additionally, giant reed, sweetcane, and giant miscanthus produced greater root biomass (9-11 Mg ha(-1)) compared with the other three species (2.5-3.2 Mg ha(-1)). Among the six grasses, sweetcane, energycane, and elephantgrass resulted in increases in soil C stocks (similar to 15 Mg ha(-1)) relative to the initial level. Conversely, giant reed and giant miscanthus had no increase in soil C stock. Results suggested that interspecies differences observed in biomass yield among the six perennial bioenergy grasses could therefore affect soil C accumulation. High biomass yielding species such as sweetcane, energycane, and elephantgrass can effectively increase soil C within a few years following establishment in a subtropical environment.

TI  - CO2 capture study in advanced Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle
AB  - This paper presents the results of technical and economical studies carried out by EDF-R&amp;D in collaboration with various organizations (Ademe, Ecole des Mines de Paris, GÃ©ostock, Tractebel, Technip, UOP) in order to evaluate, in the French context, me future production cost of electricity from coal IGCC power plants with CO2 capture and sequestration and me resulting cost per tonne of CO2 avoided. The studies aimed at performing a realistic approach of the energy penalty due to the integration of CO2 capture in IGCC power plants as well as a realistic evaluation of the transport and storage costs taking into account the topography for the CO2 transport pipeline and the reservoir characteristics for the CO2 storage. In this work we assumed two hypothetical 1 GW coal IGCC power plants, one close to the inland French city of Metz and the other one close to the city of Nantes in the French Atlantic cost. This corresponds to a traditional localization for coal power plants in France, but does not necessarily constitute the optimal situation wim respect to the storage zones of CO2 and to the constraints of fuel supply. Two options for the IGCC are considered, one consisting of 3 Ã— 340 MW IGCC units of the Puertollano type termed as 'classical', each IGCC unit is based on one train of gasifier fed with dry coal operated at 27 bar integrated to a 53% efficiency combined cycle. The second option considers a more 'advanced' IGCC which consists of two trains of Texaco quench gasifier fed with slurry containing 64% mass of coal and 36% mass of water operated at 64 bar integrated to a 60% efficiency combined cycle with two trains of H technology gas turbine, two trains of heat recovery steam generator and one steam turbine. This latter IGCC system could deliver 1200 MWe IGCC with a single unit. Concerning the CO2 capture, six physical and chemical absorption processes were modelled with the Aspen Plusâ„¢ software. After a selection based on energy performances three processes were selected and studied in detail: two physical processes based on methanol and Selexolâ„¢ solvents, and a chemical process using activated MDEA. For 'advanced' IGCC operating at high pressure only physical processes are assessed, methanol. Concerning the CO2 transport we only selected the 'pipeline' option even for offshore geological storage as the 'ship' option seems more expensive for short distance offshore transport. On the other hand, concerning the storage, several types of reservoirs were considered: storage in depleted oil or gas fields and storage in deep aquifers. In the case of deep aquifers we also evaluate the potential influence of CO2 quantity to be sequestered (varying from 5 to 50 Mt/year) on the cost of the transport and storage equipments. Detailed study on transport and storage is given in reference [11]. The economic evaluation shows that the total cost of base load electricity produced in France by coal IGCC power plants with CO2 capture and storage could reach Euros 63/MWh with 'classical' IGCC and Euros 58/MWh with advanced IGCC. This is almost one and half the production cost achieved by a 600 MW supercritical pulverised coal unit fully equipped with flue gas treatment but without the CO2 capture. The cost per tonne of avoided CO2 is evaluated at about 53.5 Euros with 'classical' IGCC and 48.9 Euros with 'advanced' IGCC. These high values should be interpreted cautiously, firstly because 'advanced' IGCC designs could reduce the energy penalty of CO2 capture in future plants, and secondly because the transport and storage costs are strongly depending upon the distance from the power plants, the quantity of CO2 transported, the presence of a collecting CO2 network if any and the storage characteristics (permeability, depth, type of reservoirs, on-shore or off-shore location). Favourable projects location with optimised technology could lead to lower costs but, if the characteristics of the reservoirs are worse than estimated and if stringent regulations (unclear today) are set up for CO2 transport and storage this could also lead to higher costs.

TI  - Investigation of jet breakup and droplet size distribution of liquid CO2 and water systems - Implications for CO2 hydrate formation for ocean carbon sequestration
AB  - An experimental investigation has been conducted into the effect of fluid velocity and orifice size on the breakup patterns of liquid CO2 in water, as well as those for water in CO2, Under high-pressure and low-temperature conditions, the jet breakup patterns follow distinct Rayleigh, transitional, and spray modes. Droplet size distribution was determined in the different modes, with the spray mode producing the smallest droplets and the most uniform size distribution. The system appears to progress from transitional to spray mode when the Ohnesorge number is approximately 18 Re-1. Using this relationship, it is possible to predict the minimum injection rate necessary for spray mode at any injector diameter. Under hydrate-forming conditions, the jet breakup did not appear to be affected because breakup occurred faster than hydrate formation. However, injection into a confined space could promote droplet coalescence, resulting in a larger average drop size. These results can be used to control hydrate conversion in an ocean CO2 injection system and to ensure a large dispersion of injected CO2 during its sequestration in the ocean.

TI  - Operationalizing marketable blue carbon
AB  - The global carbon sequestration and avoided emissions potentially achieved via blue carbon is high (-3\% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions); however, it is limited by multidisciplinary and interacting uncertainties spanning the social, governance, financial, and technological dimensions. We compiled a transdisciplinary team of experts to elucidate these challenges and identify a way forward. Key actions to enhance blue carbon as a natural climate solution include improving policy and legal arrangements to ensure equitable sharing of benefits; improving stewardship by incorporating indigenous knowledge and values; clarifying property rights; improving financial approaches and accounting tools to incorporate co-benefits; developing technological solutions for measuring blue carbon sequestration at low cost; and resolving knowledge gaps regarding blue carbon cycles. Implementing these actions and operationalizing blue carbon will achieve measurable changes to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, provide multiple co-benefits, and address national obligations associated with international agreements.

TI  - Ecosystem carbon storage affected by intertidal locations and climatic factors in three estuarine mangrove forests of South China
AB  - Recent studies have highlighted that mangroves could serve as an important carbon reservoir, playing an important role in climate regulation. Nonetheless, there remain uncertainties about their carbon storage estimations due to mangrove carbon-cycle processes affected by the interactions among climatic factors, hydro-geomorphic settings, and mangrove species. This study aimed to quantify how ecosystem carbon storage (ECS) (i.e., vegetation biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC)) was affected by intertidal locations and climatic factors based on new and published data from different latitudinal zones. Landward mangrove communities accumulated significantly higher carbon in both vegetation and soil compared with seaward mangrove communities. Average ECS of Dongzhai Harbor, Yingluo Bay, and Dongjiang Estuary were 351.35Mgha(-1), 306.93Mgha(-1), and 162.04Mgha(-1), respectively. ECS values were underestimated because SOC storage accounting for more than 60\% of ECS was only estimated on the top 100-cm sediment in this study. Compared with upland forests, there was remarkably higher SOC storage in mangroves, especially in Dongzhai Harbor and Yingluo Bay. Regression analysis indicated that ECS nonlinearly decreased as latitude increased. ECS significantly enhanced as air temperature of the coldest month (T-min) and mean annual precipitation (P-mean) increased on a global scale, suggesting that T-min and P-mean were the major controls of ECS. Nevertheless, ECS of mangroves in China was significantly correlated with mean annual air temperature (T-mean) and T-min at a filed scale, and was nonlinearly increased as T-min and T-mean increased. Therefore, the influencing factor of ECS spatial patterns was partly affected by statistical scales.

TI  - Spatiotemporal change and the naturalâ€“human driving processes of a megacityâ€™s coastal blue carbon storage
AB  - Coastal blue carbon storage (CBCS) plays a key role in addressing global climate change and realizing regional carbon neutrality. Although blue carbon has been studied for some years, there is little understanding of the influence of a megacityâ€™s complex natural and human-driven processes on CBCS. Taking the Shanghai coastal area as an example, this study investigated the spatiotemporal change in CBCS using the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) model during 1990â€“2015, and analyzed the response of the CBCS to a megacityâ€™s complex natural-and human-driven processes through a land use/land cover transition matrix and hierarchical clustering. The results were as follows: (1) Thirty-three driving processes were identified in the study area, including four natural processes (e.g., accretion, succession, erosion, etc.), two human processes (reclamation and restoration) and twenty-seven naturalâ€“human coupled processes; they were further combined into single and multiple processes with positive and negative influences on the CBCS into four types (Mono+, Monoâˆ’, Multiple+ and Multipleâˆ’ driving processes). (2) Shanghaiâ€™s CBCS increased from 1659.44 Ã— 104 Mg to 1789.78 Ã—104 Mg, though the amount of Shanghaiâ€™s coastal carbon sequestration showed a decreasing trend in three periods: 51.28 Ã— 104 Mg in 1990â€“2000, 42.90 Ã— 104 Mg in 2000â€“2009 and 36.15 Ã— 104 Mg in 2009â€“2015, respectively. (3) There were three kinds of spatiotemporal patterns in the CBCS of this study area: high adjacent to the territorial land, low adjacent to the offshore waters in 1990; high in the central part, low in the peripheral areas in 2009 and 2015; and a mixed pattern in 2000. These patterns resulted from the different driving processes present in the different years. This study could serve as a blueprint for restoring and maintaining the CBCS of a megacity, to help mitigate the conflicts between socioeconomic development and the conservation of the CBCS, especially in the Shanghai coastal area.

TI  - A global predictive model of carbon in mangrove soils
AB  - Mangroves are among the most threatened and rapidly vanishing natural environments worldwide. They provide a wide range of ecosystem services and have recently become known for their exceptional capacity to store carbon. Research shows that mangrove conservation may be a low-cost means of reducing CO2 emissions. Accordingly, there is growing interest in developing market mechanisms to credit mangrove conservation projects for associated CO2 emissions reductions. These efforts depend on robust and readily applicable, but currently unavailable, localized estimates of soil carbon. Here, we use over 900 soil carbon measurements, collected in 28 countries by 61 independent studies, to develop a global predictive model for mangrove soil carbon. Using climatological and locational data as predictors, we explore several predictive modeling alternatives, including machine-learning methods. With our predictive model, we construct a global dataset of estimated soil carbon concentrations and stocks on a high-resolution grid (5 arc min). We estimate that the global mangrove soil carbon stock is 5.00Â±0.94 Pg C (assuming a 1 meter soil depth) and find this stock is highly variable over space. The amount of carbon per hectare in the world's most carbon-rich mangroves (approximately 703Â±38 Mg C ha-1) is roughly a 2.6Â±0.14 times the amount of carbon per hectare in the world's most carbon-poor mangroves (approximately 272Â±49 Mg C ha-1). Considerable within country variation in mangrove soil carbon also exists. In Indonesia, the country with the largest mangrove soil carbon stock, we estimate that the most carbon-rich mangroves contain 1.5Â±0.12 times as much carbon per hectare as the most carbon-poor mangroves. Our results can aid in evaluating benefits from mangrove conservation and designing mangrove conservation policy. Additionally, the results can be used to project changes in mangrove soil carbon stocks based on changing climatological predictors, e.g. to assess the impacts of climate change on mangrove soil carbon stocks.

TI  - An updated assessment of the acute impacts of ocean carbon sequestration by direct injection
AB  - This paper evaluates the expected environmental impact of several promising schemes for ocean carbon sequestration by direct injection of CO2, and serves as a major update to the assessment by Auerbach et al. (1997) and Caulfield et al. (1997) of water quality impacts and the induced mortality to zooplankton. The impact assessment methodology from the earlier studies has been updated to incorporate the extended probit methodology of Sato et al. (2004), and revised mortality relationships based mainly on copepods were developed after a thorough review of publicly available CO2 toxicity data for zooplankton and fish. The impact assessment is conducted for three discharge approaches, each designed to maximize dilution over the water column: a point release of negatively buoyant CO2 hydrate particles from a moving ship; a stationary point release of CO2 hydrate particles forming a sinking plume; and a long, bottom-mounted diffuser discharging buoyant liquid CO2 droplets. Two of these scenarios take advantage of the enhanced dilution offered by CO2 hydrate particles, and are based on ongoing laboratory and field studies on the formation and behavior of such particles (Chow et al., 2008). Overall, results suggest that it is possible with present or near present technology to engineer discharge configurations that achieve sufficient dilution to largely avoid acute impacts. In particular, the moving ship hydrate discharge is identified as the most promising due to its operational flexibility. In addition to lethal effects, sub-lethal and ecosystem effects are discussed qualitatively, though not analyzed quantitatively. The main conclusion from our analysis is that ocean carbon sequestration by direct injection should not be dismissed as a climate change mitigation strategy on the basis of environmental impact alone. Rather, it can be considered as a viable option for further study, especially in regions where geologic sequestration proves impractical. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Carbon stocks and greenhouse gas emissions (CH4 and N2O) in mangroves with different vegetation assemblies in the central coastal of Veracruz Mexico
AB  - The aim of this study was to quantify carbon stocks and the emission of the greenhouse gases (N2O and CH4) in mangrove forests with different vegetation assemblies in coastal lagoons of Veracruz Mexico. The vegetation included: black mangrove BM, dominated by Avicennia germinans, white mangrove WM, dominated by Laguncularia. racemose, red mangrove RM, dominated by Rhizophora mangle and mixed mangrove MM, dominated by the three species. Soil C stocks ranged 187-671 Mg C ha(-1) without significant (p = 0.149) differences among the mangroves with different vegetation. Significantly (p = 0.049) higher tree biomass C stock was observed in RM (127 Mg ha(-1)) than in MM (24.23 Mg ha(-1)). Methane emissions in RM (0.58-6.03 mg m-2 min-1) were significantly higher (p b 0.05) than in MM. (0.0035-0.07 mg m(-2) min(-1)), in WM (-0.0026-0.029 mg m(-2) min(-1)) and in BM (0.0054-0.0097 mg m(-2) min(-1)),during rainy, windy and dry season.RM had the longest period of inundation, the highest soil carbon concentration, and the lowest salinity. CH4 emissions showed a significantly positive correlation with soils carbon concentration, water level and water pH and, negative correlation with water salinity and Cl-1 concentration in soil and water. Emissions of N2O (0.04-3.25 mu g m(-2) min(-1)) were not significantly different among the mangroves with different vegetation, but they showed seasonal variations, with higher emissions during windy and dry seasons. N2O emissions showed significantly positive correlations with soil nitrate concentration and soil temperature. Results of this research are useful for mangrove conservation and restoration strategies to maximize carbon storage and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Investigation of enhanced exploitation of natural gas hydrate and CO2 sequestration combined gradual heat stimulation with CO2 replacement in sediments
AB  - CO2 replacement is a promising technology that simultaneously produces methane and carbon dioxide seques-tration. In this work, a novel gradual heat injection enhanced replacement method (GHIR) was proposed to improve the methane production from natural gas hydrate sedimentary layer. The effects of heat injection mode on methane recovery, energy efficiency and the optimal operating conditions of GHIR were studied. The results have shown that GHIR enhances the CH4 recovery percentage from 8.0\% to 25.4\%. EROI could be further enhanced to 20.14. Because the thermal conductivity of hydrate is larger than the dissociation hydrate layer, the heat transfer analysis shown that the incremental heat injection enhanced replacement method (IHIR) is the best mode for gradual heat stimulation combined CO2 replacement. This work provides a novel method for future marine NGH development and promotes carbon sequestration by applying the CH4/CO2 replacement method.

TI  - Mangrove microbiota along the urban-to-rural gradient of the Cayenne estuary (French Guiana, South America): Drivers and potential bioindicators
AB  - The microbial communities inhabiting the Atlantic-East Pacific (AEP) mangroves have been poorly studied, and mostly comprise chronically polluted mangroves. In this study, we characterized changes in the structure and diversity of microbial communities of mangroves along the urban-to-rural gradient of the Cayenne estuary (French Guiana, South America) that experience low human impact. The microbial communities were assigned into 50 phyla. Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes were the most abundant taxa. The environmental determinants found to significantly correlated to the microbial communities at these mangroves were granulometry, dieldrin concentration, pH, and total carbon (TC) content. Furthermore, a precise analysis of the sediment highlights the existence of three types of anthropogenic pressure among the stations: (i) organic matter (OM) enrichment due to the proximity to the city and its wastewater treatment plant, (ii) dieldrin contamination, and (iii) naphthalene contamination. These forms of weak anthropogenic pressure seemed to impact the bacterial population size and microbial assemblages. A decrease in Bathyarchaeota, ``Candidatus Nitrosopumilus{''}, and Nitrospira genera was observed in mangroves subjected to OM enrichment. Mangroves polluted with organic contaminants were enriched in Desulfobacteraceae, Desulfarculaceae, and Acanthopleuribacteraceae (with dieldrin or polychlorobiphenyl contamination), and Chitinophagaceae and Geobacteraceae (with naphthalene contamination). These findings provide insights into the main environmental factors shaping microbial communities of mangroves in the AEP that experience low human impact and allow for the identification of several potential microbial bioindicators of weak anthropogenic pressure.

TI  - Heterogeneity-assisted carbon dioxide storage in marine sediments
AB  - Global climate change is a pressing problem caused by the accumulation of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage is a promising component of a portfolio of options to stabilize atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Meaningful capture and storage requires the permanent isolation of enormous amounts of CO2 away from the atmosphere. We investigate the effectiveness of heterogeneity-induced trapping mechanism, in potential synergy with a self-sealing gravitational trapping mechanism, for secure CO2 storage in marine sediments. We conduct the first comprehensive study on heterogeneous marine sediments with various thicknesses at various ocean depths. Prior studies of gravitational trapping have assumed homogeneous (deep-sea) sediments, but numerous studies suggest reservoir heterogeneity may enhance CO2 trapping. Heterogeneity can deter the upward migration of CO2 and prevent leakage through the seafloor into the seawater. Using geostatistically-based Monte Carlo simulations of CO2 transport in heterogeneous sediment, we show that strong spatial variability in permeability is a dominant physical mechanism for secure CO2 storage in marine sediments below 1.2 km water depth (less than half of the depth needed for the gravitational trapping). We identify thresholds for sediment thickness, mean permeability and porosity, and their relationships to meaningful injection rates. Our results for the U.S. Gulf of Mexico suggest that heterogeneity-assisted trapping has a greater areal extent with more than three times the CO2 storage capacity for secure offshore CO2 storage than with gravitational trapping. These characteristics offer CO2 storage opportunities that are closer to coasts, more accessible, and likely to be less costly. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - BP, Rio Tinto launch clean carbon with kwinana project
AB  - BP and the mining giant Rio Tinto, which have launched a joint venture company to develop carbon capture and storage (CCS) power projects around the world, have announced a project to build a coal-fired power plant with CCS technology at Kwinana, western Australia. This A$2b Hydrogen Energy project will employ Rio Tinto's know-how and assets in coal mining and BP's expertise in chemical processing, low-carbon power generation and CCS. The plant is expected to have a capacity of 500 MW, equivalent to 15% of the demand of south-west Australia, and capture around 4m t/y of carbon dioxide. Carbon sequestration can reduce carbon dioxide emission from coal, natural gas or coke-fired power plants by 90%. Carbon dioxide would be stored deep underground, in offshore geological structures in the Perth Basin, and will be used for enhanced oil recovery in a nearby oil field from 2011 onwards.
