TI  - The limits of reduced order current energy converter modeling
AB  - Reduced-order models for mesoscale current energy converter (CEC) modeling allow for tractablecomputation times for investigations of array configurations on power performance and environmentaleffects to support design optimization. The CEC representation in these models take the form of actuatordiscs in codes such as SNL-Delft3D-CEC-FM treating the rotating CEC blades as momentum sinks. Inthe first-of-its-kind, whole-plant optimization software, DTOcean, the hydrodynamic modelling of CECsis reduced one step further by superimposing wake models based on normalized CFD simulations onto aset of pre-computed velocity fields, to provide power estimates. DTOcean is a new tool and the amountof verification and validation evidence gathered is presently limited. To gain additional confidence andindustry buy-in to the software penetration, this study investigated a primary component of levelized cost ofelectricity (LCOE) calculation, annual energy production (AEP), through an analytic calculation of powerusing the results of an identical simulation in SNL-Delt3D-CEC-FM. Three configurations of an 8-turbinearray are studied with DTOcean where two rows of 4-turbines are spaced (unstaggered) 5-, 10-, and 20-Diameters apart and the AEP was calculated; The energy calculation in SNL-Delft3D-CEC-FM were morecomputationally expensive for the mesoscale domain making the optimization of solely an arrays powerproduction using the wake superposition method implemented DTOcean attractive. The codes however arecomplementary as SNL-Delft3D-CEC-FM simultaneously investigates environmental effects of varyingarray configurations while DTOcean considers all aspects of array costs through its lifetime to optimizeLCOE from a whole-plant perspective.

TI  - ESTIMATION OF ONSITE WAVE PARAMETERS FROM THE WINDFLOAT PLATFORM
AB  - The Wind Float is a semi-submersible floating foundation supporting multi-megawatt wind turbines. A full-scale 2MW Wind Float demonstration unit was installed off the coast of Portugal in October 2011. Many instruments are installed on this prototype to measure the environmental conditions and the response of the platform at the site. The first section of the paper focuses on the validation of the wave measurements obtained from two radar-based wave probes onboard the platform. The wave elevation at the site is reconstructed and typical wave statistics are computed. The results are compared and validated with independent buoy measurements close to site. The second section of the paper presents estimates of prevailing wave direction and directional wave spectra based on platform motions. These results are also benchmarked with onsite buoy measurements.

TI  - A Novel DC Voltage Control Strategy for Multi-terminal HVDC System with Offshore Wind Farms Integration
AB  - DC voltage control and power distribution are significant requirements for multi-terminal HVDC control system. The common voltage droop control has the drawback of failing to keep the dc voltage at a fixed value if active power is fluctuating, and voltage margin method actually controls dc voltage only by one converter at a time. A novel control strategy-Coordinated DC Voltage Control-is thus proposed. This strategy utilizes telecommunication technology to coordinate all the grid side converters to control dc voltage. A stable dc voltage as well as accurate power distribution according to the minimization of power loss or other optimal power flow algorithm can be achieved. The control effects are validated based on a five-terminal HVDC system modeling in PSCAD/EMTDC with three different scenarios, including steady state and dynamic state. The satisfactory simulation results prove the feasibility and robustness of the proposed control strategy.

TI  - The economic impacts of a submarine HVDC interconnection between Norway and Great Britain
AB  - In the present paper we analyze the profitability of different HVDC interconnection alternatives between Norway and Great Britain for present and future scenarios. The analysis is done from a merchant and a social welfare perspective. The analyses include interconnections between Norway and Scotland and Southern Great Britain, respectively, as well as an alternative link to a future offshore wind farm. From a social welfare perspective the northern interconnection alternative is profitable under all sets of assumptions. The southern alternative is profitable under present conditions, but less than the northern alternative. The alternative link to the offshore wind park is not profitable, but this result is highly dependent on market conditions. From a merchant perspective none of the alternatives is profitable, clearly illustrating that leaving investments to commercial parties does not realize all projects that increase social welfare.

TI  - Predicting power ramps from joint distributions of future wind speeds
AB  - Power ramps are sudden changes in turbine power and must be accurately predicted to minimize costly imbalances in the electrical grid. Doing so requires reliable wind speed forecasts, which can be obtained from ensembles of physical numerical weather prediction (NWP) models through statistical postprocessing. Since the probability of a ramp event depends jointly on the wind speed distributions forecasted at multiple future times, these postprocessing methods must not only correct each individual forecast but also estimate the temporal dependencies among them. Typically though, crucial dependencies are adopted directly from the raw ensemble, and the postprocessed forecast is limited to the tens of members computationally feasible for an NWP model. We extend statistical postprocessing to include temporal dependencies using novel multivariate Gaussian regression models that forecast 24-dimensional distributions of next-day hourly wind speeds at three offshore wind farms. The continuous joint distribution forecast is postprocessed from an NWP ensemble using flexible generalized additive models for the components of its mean vector mu and for parameters defining the forecast error covariance matrix sigma. Modeling these parameters on predictors which characterize the empirical joint distribution of the NWP ensemble allows forecasts for each hour and their temporal dependencies to be adjusted in one step. Wind speed ensembles of any size can be simulated from the postprocessed joint distribution and transformed into power for computing high-resolution ramp predictions that outperform state-of-the-art reference methods.

TI  - Understanding the development and interaction of wake induced by an open centre turbine and its array design implications
AB  - The open centre turbine can be easily deployed with a kite-like mooring system, which is promising to harvest renewable marine resources due to its higher energy conversion efficiency, and lower cost, as well as the minimum impacts on the submarine environment. However, the multi-turbines deployment is still a great challenge due to the interaction between the wake flow generated by each device. Understanding the wake development is critical to implementing a strategy for multi-turbine deployment and minimizing the impact of the array on the submarine environment, the shore bed and the coast. This work aims to define the wake morphology and the multi-device configuration for the open centre turbines by applying the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis, and the Jensen model, validated by scaled experiments for traditional turbines. The first step of the research deals with a stand-alone fully resolved turbine geometry. The annular rotor works like a Venturi channel: the flow passing through the central hole rises its velocity and reduces the pressure behind the rotor plane. The induced suction effect reduces the tangential flow velocity components, containing either the wake radial expansion to 1.6R (turbine radius) and axial extension to 6D (turbine diameter). The wake takes a cylindrical shape and the flow field outside this cylinder can be assumed as undisturbed. The second step of research deals with the study of an optimal multi-device layout. The parameters to be found are the distance between rotorsâ€™ rows and turbinesâ€™ wheelbase, under the condition that the power of each turbine is almost equal. For a 2 staggered turbines layout, a wheelbase of 3D and a distance between rows of 5D allow for keeping the devicesâ€™ performances constant, being, in both cases, the array Cp = 0.414. For 3 turbines in two staggered rows, the optimal configuration is characterized by a wheelbase of 1.5D and a distance between rows of 3D, with an array Cp = 0.413. The key to this performance is the cylindrical wake generated by the open centre rotor geometry: in the multi-device configuration any turbine is decoupled, so there is no mutual disturbance even at reduced inter-device clearances.

TI  - Analytical investigation and experimental validation of an inverted cup float used for wave energy conversion
AB  - World energy demand is increasing at an alarming rate and producing electricity from alternative or renewable energy sources is becoming necessary. There are many technologies to extract electric energy from sea waves such as: the oscillating water column, the point absorber, the overtopping system and the bottom hinged system. Many researchers are focusing on modeling the floating point absorber, which is thought to be the most cost effective technology to extract energy from sea waves. This paper is mainly work on a new design of float and the analytical analysis of its performance. This float consists of two parts; a hollow cylinder and an inverted cup fixed to its bottom. The float is initially submerged in water with sufficient submergence float. Water rises up due to the wave action and the float will follow the water motion which reduces slamming of the float. When the water level drops, the water enclosed in the inverted cup is exposed to a negative pressure which help the float down to follow the water wave motion without slamming. In this work, an analytical model is used MATLAB SOFTWARE to simulate the system of energy conversion. Moreover, a comparison for this model of the simulation results with experimental data to validate the model. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The use of Sentinel-1 OCN products for preliminary deep offshore wind energy potential estimation: A case study on Ionian sea
AB  - The exploitation of wind energy potential has been strongly limited in the Mediterranean area due to its critical bathymetry. However, the spread of new deep offshore technologies such as floating turbines could drastically change the actual scenario, allowing wind energy to be exploited even in areas with critical bathymetric conditions. In such framework, remote sensing technologies could significantly help the development of offshore wind farms and may represent a valid resource for better planning wind energy solutions. In this article, a satellite based methodology for assessing the wind energy potential of offshore areas is presented and applied on a study case in the Ionian sea to identify the most effective areas for energy harvesting. The study is based on the use of the Sentinel-1 OCeaN (OCN) products, which are Level-2 sea-based data products provided by Copernicus (the principle European Union's earth observation programme), containing wind retrieval information. Despite their proven accuracy and their ease of use, OCN products have been rarely used in recent scientific production for energetic purposes. An initial investigation on wind speed characteristics has been carried out using as reference data-set the one provided by the Global Wind Atlas (GWA). A sub-area with maximum coastal wind speed gradient has been identified in the Region of Interest (ROI). Afterwards, 54 Sentinel-1 images have been processed. Data have been aggregated on a monthly domain (February 2020 -January 2021) to produce 12 wind speed maps of the ROI sub-area. A productivity analysis has been carried out in three specific sites. Results show: (i) the effectiveness of an OCN products based methodology for wind energy solutions planning, (ii) the reliability of the monthly based data aggregation (proven by a spatial dispersion analysis) and (iii) the specific wind energy production potentialities of the chosen ROI, where a single wind turbine installation could ensure an annual power production up to 19.06 GWh.(c) 2022 The Authors.

TI  - In-Stream Energy by Tidal and Wind-Driven Currents: An Analysis for the Gulf of California
AB  - We analyzed the peak spring tidal current speeds, annual mean tidal power densities (TPD) and annual energy production (AEP) obtained from experiment 06.1, referred as the ``HYCOM model{''} throughout, of the three dimensional (3D), global model HYCOM in an area covering the Baja California Pacific and the Gulf of California. The HYCOM model is forced with astronomical tides and surface winds alone, and therefore is particularly suitable to assess the tidal current and wind-driven current contribution to in-stream energy resources. We find two areas within the Gulf of California, one in the Great Island Region and one in the Upper Gulf of California, where peak spring tidal flows reach speeds of 1.1 m per second. Second to fifth-generation tidal stream devices would be suitable for deployment in these two areas, which are very similar in terms of tidal in-stream energy resources. However, they are also very different in terms of sediment type and range in water depth, posing different challenges for in-stream technologies. The highest mean TPD value when excluding TPDs equal or less than 50 W m(-2) (corresponding to the minimum velocity threshold for energy production) is of 172.8 W m(-2), and is found near the town of San Felipe, at (lat lon) = (31.006-114.64); here energy would be produced during 39.00\% of the time. Finally, wind-driven currents contribute very little to the mean TPD and the total AEP. Therefore, the device, the grid, and any energy storage plans need to take into account the periodic tidal current fluctuations, for optimal exploitation of the resources.

TI  - Morinda lucida effects on steel-reinforced concrete in 3.5\% NaCl: Implications for corrosion-protection of wind-energy structures in saline/marine environments
AB  - This paper studies effects of the leaf-extract of Morinda lucida on the corrosion-degradation of steel-reinforced concrete in 3.5\% NaCl, simulating saline/marine environment (prevalent in offshore environments for wind-energy structures/installations). Electrochemical monitoring techniques and compressive-strength testing were employed for different concentrations of the leaf-extract admixture in duplicates of steel-reinforced concrete specimens, partially immersed in the corrosive-medium. Analyses of the experimental test-results according to specification ASTM G16-95 R04 showed that Morinda lucida leaf-extract combined highly-efficient corrosion inhibition, 84.82+/-7.76\% <= eta <= 95.64+/-1.50\%, with good compressive-strength improvements in their admixed steel-reinforced concretes. These bear implications for corrosion-protection of wind-energy structures in saline/marine environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Design method of wave power generator device with wells turbine
AB  - This is a report of a fundamental study on the design method that includes the interaction between air chambers and turbines, using the rule of similarity in the nondimensional form of governed equations. It is presented how to analyze the power absorbed in irregular waves by use of both their spectrum and probability. It is shown that the linear theory of water waves and the equivalent floating body approximation are applicable to the evaluation of the absorbed power in air chambers. Furthermore, in order to get good agreements with the experiments, losses of air chambers owing to the viscosity should be added in the analysis. Turbine performances in irregular waves are easily shown with the probability density distribution that is, Gauss distribution. This paper also presents the design method that can predict the minimum cost in the constrution, which is now very important to develop these facilities in the society.

TI  - Enabling mMTC in Remote Areas: LoRaWAN and LEO Satellite Integration for Offshore Wind Farm Monitoring
AB  - The offshore wind farms are gaining momentum due to their promise to offer sustainable energy with low pollution and greenhouse gas emission. However, despite all the immense technological progress of recent years, the operation in a harsh and hard-to-reach environment remains challenging. According to the reports, each offshore wind turbine requires five maintenance visits a year on average, and the cumulative repair costs constitute around 30% of the turbine's life-cycle expenditure. Motivated by the advancement of massive machine-type connectivity (mMTC) and satellite technologies, in this study, we investigate the potential of these to enable remote monitoring of the offshore wind farms. Specifically, the two alternative architectures are considered. The indirect architecture relies on using a local mMTC gateway (GW) with a backbone over a reliable communication channel (e.g., satellite or wire-based). The direct approach implies the transmission of the data by sensors on the wind turbines directly to the mMTC GW on the low-Earth-orbit satellite. The details of the system design, the alternative implementation strategies, and relevant pros, cons, and tradeoffs are pin-pointed. Finally, we employ simulations using realistic deployment and traffic and advanced propagation and collision models to characterize these two approaches' feasibility and packet delivery probability numerically when implemented over LoRaWAN mMTC technology.

TI  - AC Grid Forming by Coordinated Control of Offshore Wind Farm connected to Diode Rectifier based HVDC Link - Review and Assessment of Solutions
AB  - Diode Rectifier (DR) based HVDC transmission can significantly reduce system costs and foot print of an HVDC power station for Offshore Wind Farms (OWFs), but as a consequence, the control of the offshore AC grid becomes challenging. The replacement of the offshore Voltage Source Converter (VSC) by a passive DR leads to major research questions pertaining to the control of the offshore AC grid. To achieve the wind farm operation and seamless power extraction, many grid forming solutions have been devised. This paper reviews a few of the major control solutions for AC grid forming and operation of DR-HVDC based OWFs, following which a comparison is made between them. Then two of these solutions are selected and implemented in a study case OWF model. By using the simulation results and further analysis, the approaches adopted by these two solutions are elaborated further and the various challenges regarding the operation and control of the DR-HVDC based OWF are highlighted.

TI  - Analysis of the fatigue damage on the offshore wind turbines exposed to wind and wave loads within the typhoon area
AB  - For the design of offshore wind turbines exposed to wind and wave loads, the method of combining the wind load and the wave load is significantly important to properly calculate the maximum stresses and deflections of the towers and the foundations1)'. Similarly, for the analysis of the fatigue damage critical to the structural life, the influences of combined wind and wave loads have not been clearly verified. In this paper fatigue damage at the time of typhoon passing is analyzed using actually recorded data, though intrinsically long-term data more than 10 years should be used to properly evaluate the fatigue damage. This paper concludes that the fatigue damage of the tower caused by the wave load is not substantial and, thus, the fatigue damage by the combined wind and wave load is only 2-3% larger than the simple addition of the independent fatigue damages by the wind and the wave loads. The fatigue damage of the tower top, which is required to reduce the diameter in order to minimize the aerodynamic confliction with blades, is larger than that of the tower bottom. The fatigue damage at the foundation by the combined wind and wave load is 25% larger than the simple addition of the wind and wave damages, as the foundation is directly exposed to the wave load. For the foundation, the proper structural section can be designed in order to improve the structural performance against fatigue.

TI  - Residency, demographics, and movement patterns of North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis in an offshore wind energy development area in southern New England, USA
AB  - Offshore wind energy development is growing quickly around the world. In southern New England, USA, one of the largest commercial offshore wind energy farms in the USA will be established in the waters off Massachusetts and Rhode Island, an area used by the Critically Endangered North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis. Prior to 2011, little was known about the use of this area by right whales. We examined aerial survey data collected between 2011-2015 and 2017-2019 to quantify right whale distribution, residency, demography, and movements in the region. Right whale occurrence increased during the study period. Since 2017, whales have been sighted in the area nearly every month, with peak sighting rates between late winter and spring. Model outputs suggest that 23\% of the species' population is present from December through May, and the mean residence time has tripled to an average of 13 d during these months. Age and sex ratios of the individuals present in the area are similar to those of the species as a whole, with adult males the most common demographic group. Movement models showed that southern New England is an important destination for right whales, including conceptive and reproductive females, and qualitative observations included animals feeding and socializing. Implementing mitigation procedures in coordination with these findings will be crucial in lessening the potential impacts on right whales from construction noise, increased vessel traffic, and habitat disruption in this region.

TI  - How to improve the state of the art in metocean measurement datasets
AB  - We present an analysis of three datasets of 10&thinsp;min metocean measurement statistics and our resulting recommendations to both producers and users of such datasets. Many of our recommendations are more generally of interest to all numerical measurement data producers. The datasets analyzed originate from offshore meteorological masts installed to support offshore wind farm planning and design: the Dutch OWEZ and MMIJ and the German FINO1. Our analysis shows that such datasets contain issues that users should look out for and whose prevalence can be reduced by producers. We also present expressions to derive uncertainty and bias values for the statistics from information typically available about sample uncertainty. We also observe that the format in which the data are disseminated is sub-optimal from the users' perspective and discuss how producers can create more immediately useful dataset files. Effectively, we advocate using an established binary format (HDF5 or netCDF4) instead of the typical text-based one (comma-separated values), as this allows for the inclusion of relevant metadata and the creation of significantly smaller directly accessible dataset files. Next to informing producers of the advantages of these formats, we also provide concrete pointers to their effective use. Our conclusion is that datasets such as the ones we analyzed can be improved substantially in usefulness and convenience with limited effort. Â© 2020.

TI  - Potential evaluation and long-run installation scheduling of offshore wind power of entire Japan
AB  - The off-shore wind energy has been drawing interest recently. This research is focusing on the potential analysis of off-shore wind energy surrounding entire Japan coast using GIS technology. Base on the economy and environment assessment, this research is evaluating the current situation and forecasting on future of wind energy technology in Japan. In order to reduce the green-house gas emission, renewable energy (such as wind energy, solar energy, fuel cell...) will gradually substitute can be installed the primary energy resource (such as coal, oil, scale gas..). Based on GIS technique, wind power turbines in the surrounding area of Japanese coast-line. In the study, 2000kW rated wind turbines are considered for further installation. As the result of this study, we have determined that 108,067 in 330 places number of off-shore with annual generation of 180.0TWhare expected. This is equal to 20% of annual total generated power of Japan in 2011. In this study, after determination of potential evaluation of offshore wind power for the entire Japan, we have applied a well-know Dynamic Programming (DP) method to propose a plan of installation of the above determined number of offshore wind power units from year 2012 to 2030 respectively. As far as we know, there is no such scheduling for introducing offshore wind power in Japan. Â© 2012 Intl Jrnal Advanced Mech.

TI  - Transmission expansion issues for offshore wind farms integration in Europe
AB  - This paper presents an overview of the major issues concerning the expansion of the European transmission system for the connection and for the integration of offshore wind farms. These issues are basically related to: i) the connection solutions for offshore wind farms (infrastructures at sea), ii) the reinforcement of the onshore transmission system for accommodating the power produced by the wind farms, while guaranteeing system security, and iii) the options for facilitating transmission investments (definition of priority projects, funding support schemes, regulatory frameworks). Concerning the first issue, we compare two connection solutions with reference to a 100-MW offshore wind farm: 150 kV alternating current (AC) and high voltage direct current based on voltage sourced converters (VSC-HVDC). An economic assessment takes into account the investment, operation and maintenance costs, and the negative valorization of losses and energy not supplied. As far as the second issue is concerned, we describe the prospects for the development of offshore wind farms and, taking into account the characteristics of the existing European wind and hydro pumped-storage facilities and a possible wind-hydro combination, we discuss the need for system reinforcement. With regard to the third issue, we present the options and instruments which exist and which are under discussion in order to facilitate transmission expansion investments, such as the list of electricity projects of common interest prepared by the European Commission and the regulatory framework of tenders for licensing offshore electricity transmission in the United Kingdom (UK).

TI  - Potential environmental effects of deepwater floating offshore wind energy facilities
AB  - Over the last few decades, the offshore wind energy industry has expanded its scope from turbines mounted on foundations driven into the seafloor and standing in less than 60 m of water, to floating turbines moored in 120 m of water, to prospecting the development of floating turbines moored in ~1,000 m of water. Since there are few prototype turbines and mooring systems of these deepwater, floating offshore wind energy facilities (OWFs) currently deployed, their effects on the marine environment are speculative. Using the available scientific literature concerning appropriate analogs, including fixed-bottom OWFs, land-based wind energy facilities, wave and tidal energy devices, and oil and gas platforms, we conducted a qualitative systematic review to estimate the potential environmental effects of deepwater, floating OWFs during operation, as well as potential mitigation measures to address some of the effects. We evaluated six categories of potential effects: changes to atmospheric and oceanic dynamics due to energy removal and modifications, electromagnetic field effects on marine species from power cables, habitat alterations to benthic and pelagic fish and invertebrate communities, underwater noise effects on marine species, structural impediments to wildlife, and changes to water quality. Our synthesis of 89 articles selected for the review suggests that many of these potential effects could be mitigated to pose a low risk to the marine environment if developers adopt appropriate mitigation strategies and best-practice protocols.

TI  - Wave energy along the Romanian Southern Black Sea coast
AB  - Wave energy is among the resources to provide the most significant contribution to the European energy system in the future. Detailed wave climate analysis is needed for the selection of accurate types of wave energy generation structure and feasibility of wave energy sites. There are current studies on spatial distribution of Black Sea wave energy, that use measured or modeled data. In this study we used measured data (significant wave height and period and wind speed) recorded in 4 locations on the Romanian Southern coast during 5 years (2013-2018) in order to estimate the available wave energy potential.

TI  - Establishment of a wave energy and technology lab to promote the experimental study of ocean and wave energy
AB  - A wave generation system was built and equipped in the wave energy and technology lab at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (UL Lafayette). The system can generate dynamic waves to simulate the ocean conditions in the Gulf of Mexico. This paper explains the design, construction, and validation of such system. With the installation of the designed wave generation system, the ocean and wave model produced in the Gulf of Mexico can be reproduced and simulated in the lab, which allows us to explore the ocean and wave energy in that gulf through experimental and computational approaches. A workshop of wave energy technology was organized in the lab to reach a broad audience and look for potential partnerships with industry and research community. Copyright Â© 2013 by ASME.

TI  - Marine renewable energy sources for desalination, generating freshwater and lithium
AB  - A novel concept is presented on lithium extraction of desalination from marine renewable energy sources. The wave-and marine current energy converters designed at Uppsala University in Sweden are evaluated as potential drivers of desalination processes, off-grid, for both local lithium extraction and freshwater production. Also, aqueous mining for other minerals is briefly discussed. Calculations, estimating the freshwater and lithium production from desalination plants powered by marine renewable energy sources, are presented. It is estimated that a medium-sized desalination plant, producing 7500 m3/day, could also generate 1.28 kg lithium daily, utilizing reverse osmosis desalination and electrodialysis, powered by marine energy converter parks. To the best of our knowledge, this concept has never previously been suggested in literature. Â© 2019 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).

TI  - Challenges and recommendations for environmental compliance for marine renewable energy: Avoiding issues early for efficient permitting and practicable mitigation
AB  - Marine renewable energy is a relatively new phenomenon that is becoming cost-competitive with traditional sources of energy. Marine hydrokinetic energy (MHK), as it moves to commercial scale, will be subject to myriad laws and regulations associated with wildlife impacts and efforts to avoid unsustainable adverse effects. At the same time that MHK is developing in this arena in the U.S., regulations and policies are changing, creating a moving target and affecting already established industries, such as oil and gas. To ensure that MHK can be cost-effective and to reduce risks of delays and impracticable project adjustments and mitigation in the U.S., early consideration of laws governing wildlife and how they are applied will be key. Planning to address wildlife priorities associated with statutory needs and industry/stakeholder goals can drive development of technology, engineering choices, siting, planning, mitigation, and adaptive management practices. Other marine industries have been recently affected by U.S. wildlife laws. For example, offshore wind is experiencing delay on the U.S. East Coast in part due to challenges with environmental statutory requirements and agency concerns about impacts. In oil and gas, it is unclear how new regulatory requirements, such as the Incidental Take Regulation pending for geophysical surveys in the Gulf of Mexico will affect the industry. MHK and other marine energy industries can leverage proactive planning and agency engagement to reduce risks of delays and costs that could significantly affect proposed projects.

TI  - New approach to the use of wave power plants
AB  - 1. One of the new approaches to the use of wave power plants can be their use as a source of compressed air for operating a pneumatic breakwater. 2. The use of wave power plants for protecting marine hydraulic structures from the effect of storm loads makes it possible to increase the cost effectiveness both of the WPPs themselves and of the hydraulic structures. 3. A rough estimate of the cost of wave power plants shows their effectiveness as a source of electrical energy for remote regions of the USSR. 4. The simplicity of the design of wave power plants enables organizing their mass production at shipyards or at the site of construction. Â© 1992 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

TI  - A general computing platform for offshore renewable energy systems (OREGEN)
AB  - This paper introduces an advanced computing platform for offshore renewable energy systems of general configuration (OREGEN), accounting for the nonlinearity of the large rotation motion and the nonlinearity of external forces, including the nonlinear Froude-Krylov force, nonlinear hydrostatic restoring force, and nonlinear mooring lines via nodal positions finite element model (FEM). Furthermore, a frequency-domain (FD) multi-body interaction (potential flow) program with a parallel algorithm has been implemented based on the boundary element method with the constant element. A time-domain (TD) program is developed with an implicit solver, and the constraints between the mooring buoys, the floaters, and the mooring lines are considered through the Lagrange multiplier method. In this paper, validation cases are conducted to verify the OREGEN by comparing the results from commercial software. For the FD-BEM solver, the results are compared with WAMIT, WADAM, and OrcaWave. The comparison results show that the solver developed is accurate and reliable. For the TD solver, a code-to-code validation of a single floater is conducted. Furthermore, the nonlinearities arising from the large body rotation motion, the geometry of the body, and the wave interacting with the wave elevation are studied. Â© 2023 the Author(s).

TI  - Specifying corrosion protection for the offshore wind turbine industry
AB  - The first offshore wind turbine farm in the world Vindeby(1) was constructed and commissioned back in 1991. The turbines have a capacity of 0.45 MW. Now 25 years later Vindeby will be decommissioned. As new turbines have much larger capacity than the existing one, replacing the turbines does not represent a good business case. Since the early 90'es rapid development has taken place with Europe being the epicenter of development. Now wind turbines with 8 MW capacity are being designed and installed and offshore wind gains ground worldwide. Offshore wind turbine projects have a relatively short design service life of 20-30 years compared to infrastructure projects designed with 50-80-100 years of service life. The offshore marine environment and special operational conditions under the influence of fatigue from the turbine however, makes durability of offshore wind turbine farms a good challenge. The service life is considered using a combination of corrosion allowance, coatings, cathodic protection and material selection. This paper presents ongoing work in relation to specifying corrosion protection for the offshore wind turbine industry in the European CEN TC219(2) committee. This comprises corrosion protection specification for external as well as internal parts of the turbine foundations. Â© 2017 by NACE International.

TI  - Hydrodynamic performance of a mono-tangent backward-rotating impeller based on tidal current energy utilization
AB  - Owing to the continuous consumption of fossil fuel and increasing environmental problems, there is an urgent need to develop technologies for the efficient use of clean energy. In this study, a mono-tangent backward-rotating impeller based on tidal current energy utilization is proposed, and its hydrodynamic performance was studied using the computational fluid dynamics method by establishing a hydrodynamic model of the backward-rotating impeller. The influences of the number of blades, impeller aspect ratio (Î»), and different flow speeds on the coefficient of power (cp) of the mono-tangent impeller were investigated. The results show that the value of cp of the mono-tangent impeller with four blades is higher than that of the impellers with two, three, five, and six blades. Î» has a significant impact on the backward-rotating impeller, with cp of the impeller reaching an optimal value when Î» = 0.5 and the flow speed is 1.25â€“1.5 m/s (with a tip speed ratio of 0.6â€“0.75).

AB  - The topic of sustainable human settlementsâ€™ and the well-being of the marine environment of the Persian Gulf is a vast challenge. It is clear that the two major sides of the Persian Gulf are experiencing completely different levels of economic investment and development. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) side on the west is verging on becoming overly developed with extensive unsustainable built environments, while the Iranian side to the east exhibits just the opposite condition, with extremely under-developed built environments but highly strategic port activities. This chapter presents two case studies to illustrate the specific characteristics, issues and challenges that projects based upon sustainable principles. The typology of high-rise architecture presents us with a significant design challenge today as we strive to reduce the energy consumption of buildings as a means of achieving sustainable development. The Intelligent Tower will employ a number of energy-generating strategies including wind turbines and photovoltaic panels. Â© The editors and contributors 2013.

TI  - A MMC Topology with AC Short-Circuit Fault Ride-Through Capability and its Control Strategies
AB  - For offshore wind power plant based on modular multilevel converter based high-voltage direct current (MMC-HVDC) transmission technology, when a short-circuit fault occurs on the onshore AC network, the DC-link voltage will rise rapidly, which may even cause equipment damage. The existing scheme basically is to connect a DC chopper in parallel on the DC bus to absorb the excess energy, but the additional equipment will increase the construction costs and land use. For this reason, this paper proposes the MMC topology with integrated energy dissipation resistors, which is capable of passing through AC short-circuit faults. This paper studies the electrical parameter design method and the corresponding control strategy of the topology, and verifies the feasibility of the scheme through simulation. Compared with the existing DC chopper solution, this scheme is relatively simple in control, and can reduce the fluctuation of the DC-link voltage, construction costs and land use due to its integration with MMC.

TI  - Cluster Control of Offshore Wind Power Plants Connected to a Common HVDC Station
AB  - In this paper a coordinated control for cluster of offshore WPPs connected to the same HVDC connection is being implemented and analyzed. The study is targeting two cases as; coordination of reactive power flow between HVDC converter and the WPP cluster while providing offshore AC grid voltage control, and coordinated closed loop control between the HVDC and the WPPs while the cluster is providing Power Oscillation Damping (POD) via active power modulation. It is shown that the coordinated cluster control helps to improve the steady-state and dynamic response of the offshore AC grid in case of offshore AC grid voltage control and onshore ancillary services provision, i.e. POD by the active power modulation of the cluster. The two cases are simulated using DIgSILENT PowerFactory, where the IEC 61400-27-1 wind turbine and WPP control models and a generic offshore layout with cluster of three WPPs are utilized.

TI  - Study on Aerodynamic Performance of Offshore Wind Turbine with Floating Platform Motion
AB  - In order to study the effect of the floating platform motion on the aerodynamic performance of offshore wind turbine, this paper analyzes the aerodynamic performance under different amplitudes of tossing movements on unsteady Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEM). The numerical model for aerodynamic performance of floating wind turbine under control system is established, which is based on the model of 5MW offshore wind turbine of National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Due to the limitation of the unsteady Blade Element Momentum Theory itself, the dynamic wake model and the yawing correction are added into the unsteady BEM theory with the Prandtl blade tip and hub loss correction, the Glauert correction and three-dimensional rotation correction. The change of thrust, torque and power in six degrees of freedom are received by calculation and the laws about aerodynamic performance of the offshore wind turbine under the six degrees of freedom platform motion is summarized.

TI  - Wave farm impact on the beach profile: A case study
AB  - If wave energy is to become a fully-fledged renewable, its environmental impacts must be fully understood. The objective of the present work is to examine the impact of a wave farm on the beach profile through a case study. The methodology is based on two coupled numerical models: a nearshore wave propagation model and a morphodynamic model, which are run in two scenarios, both with and without the wave farm. Wave data from a nearby coastal buoy are used to prescribe the boundary conditions. A positive effect on the wave climate, the cross-shore sediment transport and, consequently, the evolution of the beach profile itself due to the presence of the wave farm was found. The wave farm leads to a reduction in the erosion of the beach face. This work constitutes the first stage of the investigation of the effectiveness of a wave farm as a coastal defence measure, and the accuracy of the quantification of the erosion reduction will be enhanced in future research. In any case, the overarching picture that emerges is that wave farms, in addition to providing carbon-free energy, can be used as elements of a coastal defence scheme. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The economic impacts of marine energy developments: A case study from Scotland
AB  - Delivering the ambitious renewable energy targets set by the Scottish Government will require significant expenditures. Plans have been set out to develop 1.6 GW of marine (wave and tidal) energy capacity between 2010 and 2020 in the Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters area (off the north coast of Scotland) with construction costs estimated at 6 pound billion. This paper uses multi-sectoral economic models to explore the impact that these (temporary) expenditures could have on the Scottish economy. It is shown that the standard Input-Output (IO) modelling approach significantly overstates the employment and value added impacts compared to Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) methods-in which short-run scarcity of factors of production are explicitly modelled. CGE results (under myopic and forward-looking model specifications) produce smaller impacts during the timespan of expenditures but, unlike 10 methods, identify non-trivial ``legacy effects{''} after the expenditures cease.

TI  - Tidal stream energy in China
AB  - In the recent decades, many efforts have been made by the coastal scientists and engineers for the explosion of tidal stream energy in China, as tidal stream energy is considered as one of most promising resources of marine renewable energy. Meanwhile, tidal stream energy is easy for predication and its utilization has less harm to the environment. The tidal stream energy in China could theoretically supply more than 8.2 GW, and most of them come from Zhoushan Islands, Zhejiang Province. The government of China largely invests the explosion of tidal stream energy in these years, and a significant progress has been achieved in this area. Tidal stream turbines are especially designed to improve the utilization efficiency of tidal stream energy with low impact on marine environment, and some demonstration projects of tidal stream energy are currently under plan along the coast. This study is to provide a comprehensive overview of tidal stream energy in China, including the potential assessment of energy resource, development history (achievement and difficulties) of tidal stream turbines, progress and challenges of the undergoing demonstration project, and future plan and suggestions for developing tidal stream farm in China.

TI  - Blowing in the wind
AB  - Part of the answer to rising energy needs and costs may literally be blowing in the wind. Among sustainable sources of electricity, only wind energy has the capacity and technology needed to compete in the open marketplace. The largest onshore wind farm in Europe is being built in Scotland, the largest in the USA is planned for southern California, and the biggest offshore wind farm production in the world is slated for the Thames Estuary. But wind is intermittent. Marc Genton and Amanda Hering explain how advanced statistical techniques will enable wind energy to be more efficiently incorporated into the electrical grid.

TI  - Preliminary design and performance assessment of an underwater compressed air energy storage system for wind power balancing
AB  - A key approach to large renewable power management is based on implementing storage technologies, including batteries, power-to-gas, and compressed air energy storage (CAES). This work presents the preliminary design and performance assessment of an innovative type of CAES, based on underwater compressed air energy storage (UW-CAES) volumes and intended for installation in the proximity of deep-water seas or lakes. The UW-CAES works with constant hydrostatic pressure storage and variable volumes. The proposed system is adiabatic, not using any fuel to increase the air temperature before expansion; a sufficient turbine inlet temperature (TIT) is instead obtained through a thermal energy storage (TES) system which recovers the compression heat. The system includes (i) a set of turbomachines (modular multistage compressor, with partial intercooling; expansion turbine); (ii) a TES system with different temperature levels designed to recover a large fraction of the compression heat, allowing the subsequent heating of air prior to the expansion phase; (iii) an underwater modular compressed air storage, conceived as a network of rigid but open tanks lying on the seabed and allowing a variable-volume and constant pressure operation. The compressor operates at variable loads, following an oscillating renewable power input, according to strategies oriented to improve the overall system dispatchability; the expander can be designed to work either at full load, thanks to the stability of the air flowrate and of the TIT guaranteed by the thermal storage, or at variable load. This paper first discusses in detail the sizing and off-design characterization of the overall system; then it simulates a case study where the UW-CAES is coupled to a wind farm for peak shaving and dispatchability enhancement, evaluating the impact of a realistic power input on performances and plant flexibility. Although the assessment shall be considered preliminary, it is shown that round-trip efficiency (RTE) in the range of 75-80% can be obtained depending on the compressor section configuration, making the UW-CAES a promising technology compared to electrochemical and pumped-hydrostorage systems. The technology is also applied to perform peak-shaving of the electricity production from an off-shore wind farm; annual simulations, based on realistic wind data and considering part-load operation, result in global RTE around 75% with a 10-15% reduction in the average unplanned energy injection in the electric grid. The investigated case study provides an example of the potential of this system in providing power output peak shaving when coupled with an intermittent and nonpredictable energy source.

TI  - Finite element analysis of large diameter grouted connections
AB  - When considering offshore monopile foundations designed for wind turbine support structures, a grouted connection between the monopile and an overlapping transition piece has become the de facto standard. These connections rely on axial loads being carried primarily by the bond between the steel and grout as shear. Given the critical nature of the grouted connection in a system with zero redundancy, the current design verification requirement is that a finite element analysis is performed to ascertain the viability of the connection with respect to combined axial and bending capacity whilst pure axial capacity is handled as a decoupled phenomenon using simple analytical formulas. The present paper addresses the practical modeling aspects of such a finite element model, covering subjects such as constitutive formulations for the grout, mesh density, and steel/grout interaction. The aim of the paper is to discuss different modeling approaches and, to the extent possible, provide basic guidelines for the minimum requirements valid for this type of analysis. This discussion is based on the accumulated experience gained though the independent verification of more than 10 currently operational offshore wind farms that have been certified by DNV, as well as the significant joint research and development with industry captured in the DNV Offshore Standard for Design of Offshore Wind Turbine Structures DNV-OS-J101. Moreover, general observations relating to the basic subjects such as overall geometric extent of the model, inclusion of secondary structures, detail simplification, boundary conditions, load application etc. are presented based on the authors more than 3 year involvement on the subject at DNV.

AB  - In all European countries with shallow coastal waters and strong mean wind speed at the coast the planning and construction of offshore wind farms is on the way and large parts of the North Sea and the Baltic are under investigation as to whether they are suitable for offshore parks. In this paper it is demonstrated how satellite images taken by spaceborne radar sensors can be used to determine mesoscale wind fields and thus help in the task of planning offshore wind farms. High resolution SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images acquired by the European remote sensing satellite ERS 2 are presented which show single wind turbines. The derivation of high resolution wind fields from SAR images is explained and comparisons with numerical models are presented.

The technique of material application, antifouling coating and cathodic protection are often adopted. The technical research, application, updating and development are carried on Jiangxia Tidal Power Station, which is based on the old Unit 1-Unit 5 operated for nearly 30 years, and the new Unit 6 operated in 2007. It is found that stainless steeland the antifouling coating used in Unit 1- Unit 5 are very effective, but cathodic protection is often likely to fail because of the limitation of structure and installation.

TI  - Wind Farms and Humidity
AB  - Several investigations have shown that enhanced mixing brought about by wind turbines alters near-surface meteorological conditions within and downstream of a wind farm. When scalar meteorological parameters have been considered, the focus has most often centered on temperature changes. A subset of these works has also considered humidity to various extents. These limited investigations are complemented by just a few studies dedicated to analyzing humidity changes. With onshore wind turbines often sited in agricultural areas, any changes to the microclimate surrounding a turbine can impact plant health and the length of the growing season; any changes to the environment around an offshore wind farm can change cloud and fog formation and dissipation, among other impacts. This article provides a review of observational field campaigns and numerical investigations examining changes to humidity within wind turbine array boundary layers. Across the range of empirical observations and numerical simulations, changes to humidity were observed in stably stratified conditions. In addition to the role of atmospheric stability, this review reveals that the nature of the change depends on the upstream moisture profile; robustness of the mixing; turbine array layout; distance from the turbine, in all three directions; and vertical temperature profile.

TI  - Wave energy production by a Flexible Floating Breakwater
AB  - In this paper, a numerical procedure is developed to describe the behavior of a Flexible Floating Breakwater (FFB) which represents not only a structure for shore protection but also a device for wave energy production with the utilization of a linear hydraulic power take-off (PTO) mechanism. The FFB consists of a grid of floating modules connected flexibly in two directions by: (a) connectors with known properties and (b) hydraulic power take-off mechanisms with known damping characteristics. The objective is to perform a linear hydroelastic analysis in frequency domain with a radiation/diffraction 3D hydrodynamic model considering the effect of the flexibility of the FFB as well as the damping associated with the energy extraction by the PTO. Sets of curves provide the effectiveness for both wave energy production and protection under the action of normal and oblique waves.

TI  - Choosing and evaluating sites for tidal current development
AB  - Tidal energy has been used since Roman times, although the use of tidal currents as a possible industrial energy source is a more modern concept. Unlike wind power, however, there is still no consensus on the most appropriate technology for resource exploitation. Similarities with wind power can cause errors of interpretation, especially when attempting to assess resource potential. The energy availability estimates that have been produced have, until now, only taken account of the apparent current flow speeds before the extraction of energy. As demonstrated in this paper, this may not be appropriate, especially for large energy extraction rates, which alter the underlying hydraulic nature of the flow environment. In a simple hypothetical channel linking two infinite oceans, a maximum extraction of 10 per cent of the apparent raw kinetic flux would appear to be acceptable. The limitations on sea loch type environments may, however, be less restrictive. Â© IMechE 2004.

In the proposed scheme, the AC grid and wind turbine generators (WTGs) are coordinated to keep voltages within the feasible range, reduce the active power losses and optimize reactive power distribution among the OWFs with AC grid. In the upper layer, an OPF-based voltage control method is designed for AC grid, which can achieve the optimal power flow considering the active power outputs of OWFs, to minimize the voltage deviations of all buses. In the lower layer, a MPC-based voltage control method is designed for each OWF, which can optimize reactive power distribution among WTGs inside each OWF with the reactive power output references of each OWF from the upper layer. The analytic sensitivity coefficient calculation method is applied to improve the computation efficiency. Two offshore wind farms with a modified IEEE 5 bus system were used to verify the proposed CVC scheme. Â© 2020 IEEE.

TI  - Estimation of directional distribution of wind energy from satellite observations
AB  - The offshore wind energy industry has surged in recent years as a main source of clear energy. Meanwhile, remote sensing can retrieve sea surface wind data and provide valuable information to locate suitable offshore wind power plants. Published studies mostly focus on the retrieval of average wind speed and average wind power density. However, wind directional distribution is also required in locating potential offshore wind power plants. Therefore, a method is proposed to retrieve the directional distribution of wind energy from satellite scatterometer observations. According to Chinese national standard (GB/T 18710-2002), wind directional frequency and directional distribution of wind energy density are used to delineate the directional distribution of wind energy. In addition, certain circular statistical parameters of wind energy, circular mean, and circular standard deviation are selected to depict the characteristic of wind energy. Wind speed and directional data in certain timespans are used as input in the proposed method. These wind data can be obtained from satellite observations or reanalysis datasets. Then, 0.1Â°Ã—0.1Â° global maps of wind energy directional distribution parameters are retrieved by the proposed method from 2007-2016 advanced scatterometer (ASCAT) wind products. These retrieval results are accordant with antecedent research and scientific facts. To test and verify these retrieved results, they are compared with parameters calculated from 20 NDBC buoys. First, the ASCAT wind products and buoy data are screened for quality control. Then, all buoy-measured winds are converted to 10 m height to match the ASCAT wind retrievals. Subsequently, a time and spatial matchup dataset of ASCAT and buoy data are built, and the differences between them are calculated. A non-parametric hypothesis test is also implied to assess the accuracy of circular error statistics. A total of 80% of the test dataset pairs passed all hypothesis tests and satisfied all assessment criteria (total difference <10%). Meanwhile, 100% of the dataset pairs satisfied the criteria and passed the test in which only wind direction parameters were considered. Furthermore, 90% of the dataset pairs passed the test for wind energy circular statistical parameters. In addition, 80% of the dataset pairs satisfied the total difference criteria of directional distribution wind energy. One model was constructed to describe the relation between the retrieval accuracy of wind directional distributions and record number using the law of large numbers and a basic understanding of the remote sensing process. The function that expresses the relation between record number and retrieval accuracy was obtained, and the minimal record number required to obtain reliable retrieval results was calculated with the aforementioned function by numerical stimulation and curve fitting. Moreover, the impact of the time characteristic of remote sensing data (fixed local time) was considered in the analysis. Models were built to describe the retrieval error of the remote sensing process and the actual offshore wind directional distributions on the basis of normal distribution and circular statistics. These models enabled us to understand the effect of the retrieval error of remote sensing quantitatively and qualitatively. Thus, the deconvolution algorithm was designed to eliminate this effect. Conclusion: (1) The proposed parameter systems can be retrieved by remote sensing data to depict the directional characteristics of wind energy thoroughly. (2) Two methods, namely, the total difference and the Kuiper test, were effectively used to test and verify the difference among the directional distributions. The Kuiper test results showed that the total difference identical criterion of the two directional distributions was built. (3) The validation demonstrated the effectivity and accuracy of the new method and the data product produced by this model. (4) At least 800 records were required for the reliable retrieval of DDED, and the number for DF was 350. (5) The error in the retrieval of wind direction from remote sensing data influenced not only the final retrieval accuracy of the directional distribution of wind energy but also the distribution itself. The more dispersed the distribution, the less the effect of the retrieval error of wind direction on the accuracy of directional distribution retrieval. Â© 2018, Science Press. All right reserved.

TI  - Large-scale Water-related Innovative Renewable Energy Projects and the Water Framework Directive Legal Issues and Solutions
AB  - This article discusses two legal issues that relate to the conflict between the interest of protecting water quality under the Water Framework Directive (wfd), versus the interest of promoting the use of innovative water-related renewable energy, with regard to the quota in the Renewable Energy Directive. These legal issues are: first, the conflict between the provisions of the wfd and the Renewable Energy Directive as expressed by the no-deterioration obligation, and second, the lack of integration between the Renewable Energy Directive and the derogation clause of the Water Framework Directive. Tidal energy and salinity gradient energy (blue energy) are used as a case study to show the practical relevance of the legal issues for innovative water-related renewable energy techniques. The final section discusses solutions to the legal issues. These are first, the application of adaptive management in combination with phased deployment in order to deal with uncertainty, and second, the introduction of detailed renewable energy plans per Member State in order to increase integration between the wfd and the Renewable Energy Directive.

TI  - Assessing social innovation across offshore sectors in the Dutch North Sea
AB  - Activities in the North Sea are intensifying. The European Union instructs maritime spatial planning across member states that motivates coordination of activities, stakeholders, policies, governance levels and nations. Social innovation is a concept addressing ways in which changing attitudes, behaviour or perceptions are leading to new and improved ways of acting jointly within a group and beyond. The main aim of this article is to explore social innovation in maritime spatial planning. Instances of social innovation are assessed across three sectors in the Dutch North Sea: the offshore wind energy, the offshore mussel cultivation and the offshore seaweed farming. The assessment shows that, while existing systems of social innovation are favourable to the offshore wind expansions, the barriers to grow for the offshore mussel sector include low willingness to change within the sector, and disadvantageous governmental support to change. The offshore seaweed farming is in a stage of re-organisation of not yet developed regulations, rules and norms for production offshore and enhanced cooperation, with unsure outcomes. Maritime spatial planning can play a more influential role for change if tackling main challenges, including inclusiveness, accountability, private user rights and realisation of organisation or reorganisation, and if making use of the potentials of knowledge brokers when sectors are advancing with new technologies.

TI  - Telemetry reveals strong effects of offshore wind farms on behaviour and habitat use of common guillemots (Uria aalge) during the breeding season
AB  - Seabirds have increasingly encountered offshore wind farms (OWFs) in European waters in the past 10Â years, resulting in potential conflicts with offshore foraging areas. During the breeding season, seabirds are restricted in their choice of foraging habitat and are under increased pressure to find enough prey to raise their offspring. However, information on the individual reactions of seabirds towards OWFs during the breeding season is lacking. Three OWFs located 23â€“35Â km north of the island of Helgoland have operated since October 2015. We studied their possible effects on locally breeding commonÂ guillemotsÂ (Uria aalge) using GPS tracking. GPS tags were deployed on 12 breeding guillemots from Helgoland for 8â€“26Â days during 2016â€“2017. Most individuals avoided the OWFs, but one individual in each year briefly entered the OWFs on two or three occasions. Using a point process model, we revealed a 63% reduction in the resource selection of the OWF areas compared with the surroundings (lower confidence interval (CI)Â = 79% reduction, upper CIÂ = 36% reduction). Furthermore, OWF avoidance was increased to 75% when the turbine blades were rotating (lower CI =Â 93% reduction, upper CI =Â 11% reduction). Guillemots mainly approached the OWFs from their eastern edge when resting or diving, and rarely approached the areas when commuting. These results provide a detailed description of guillemot reactions to OWFs during the breeding season, and the first comprehensive analysis of OWF effects on this species based on telemetry data. The strong avoidance effect for guillemots during the breeding season indicates the need to consider the presence of OWFs when interpreting future trends in the abundance and breeding success of this species.

TI  - Investigations on 3D effects and correlation between wave height and lip submergence of an offshore stationary OWC wave energy converter
AB  - Understanding the hydrodynamic interactions between ocean waves and the oscillating water column (OWC) wave energy converter is crucial for improving the device performance. Most previous relevant studies have focused on testing onshore and offshore OWCs using 2D models and wave flumes. Conversely, this paper provides experimental results for a 3D offshore stationary OWC device subjected to regular waves of different heights and periods under a constant power takeâ€“off (PTO) damping simulated by an orifice plate of fixed diameter. In addition, a 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model based on the RANS equations and volume of fluid (VOF) surface capturing scheme was developed and validated against the experimental data. Following the validation stage, an extensive campaign of computational tests was performed to (1) discover the impact of testing such an offshore OWC in a 2D domain or a wave flume on device efficiency and (2) investigate the correlation between the incoming wave height and the OWC front wall draught for a maximum efficiency via testing several front lip draughts for two different rear lip draughts under two wave heights and a constant PTO damping. It is found that the 2D and wave flume modelling of an offshore OWC significantly overestimate the overall power extraction efficiency, especially for wave frequencies higher than the chamber resonant frequency. Furthermore, a front lip submergence equal to the wave amplitude affords maximum efficiency whilst preventing air leakage, hence it is recommended that the front lip draught is minimized.

TI  - A Novel Bi-polar HVDC Converter and DC Fault Isolation for Offshore Wind Power Farm
AB  - Direct DC transmission technology will become an effective solution for large offshore wind power system. This paper presents a Non-isolated MMC DC converter, which can be used for direct gathering and transmission of offshore wind power system. The topology structure can be connected to the HVDC grid with high voltage difference at low cost. The bipolar design meets the transmission needs of wind power system. The multiphase interleaving topology can inhibit the ripple of input current and output voltage, and its fault-tolerant operation control method meets the deep sea low maintenance level design needs. Based on the new topology, the phase shift modulation law and one-way power flow control scheme under multi working conditions are studied. Based on MATLAB/Simulink, the simulation analysis of the topology is carried out for steady state, dynamic and short circuit faults. Finally, a prototype system is built to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis. Â© 2021 IEEE.

TI  - Load-bearing behavior of suction bucket foundations in sand
AB  - Suction buckets are a promising foundation solution for offshore wind energy systems. The bearing behavior of monopod buckets under drained monotonic loading in very dense and medium dense sand is investigated in this study by means of numerical simulation with the finite element method. Special focus is given to the ultimate capacity and the initial stiffness of the bucket-soil foundation system. The numerical model is validated by comparison with field test results. The bearing behavior of the structure is explained through an evaluation of a reference system. It is shown that the bucket experiences a heave during horizontal loading, which leads to the formation of a gap between the bucket lid and the soil with increasing load. At large loads and rotations close to failure of the system there is no contact between lid and soil, and the whole load is transferred to the soil via the bucket skirt. A parametric study shows how the ultimate capacity and initial stiffness of the system depend on the bucket dimensions and loading conditions, i.e. load eccentricity. Normalized equations for ultimate capacity and initial stiffness are derived from the numerical simulation results, which can be used in the scope of a preliminary design for buckets in sand.

The buoy was deployed from June-November 1990 alongside a reference directional wave buoy performing long term measurements for the oil industry off More country, Mid-Norway. The results illustrate that the Directional WAVERIDER is capable of providing high quality wave direction statistics, at least under the deep water conditions under which the current trials were undertaken. Combined with our experience of good reliability after operating this buoy at various locations for over 1 year, its ease of deployment and lower cost compared with conventional competing buoy systems makes this buoy a real alternative. However, some modifications on the data collection side will be needed to give it worldwide application.

TI  - Wave energy conversion energizing offshore aquaculture: Prospects along the Portuguese coastline
AB  - This paper seeks to identify promising sites and technologies, in Portugal, for co-located wave energy conversion and offshore aquaculture, whilst providing benchmark implementation references and guidelines to researchers. Accordingly, two case study sites are considered for deployment of five wave energy devices and up to six aquaculture species. A thorough analysis in terms of power ratios, efficiency, redundancy, species viability, device survivability and costs is performed, seeking to find viable co-located solutions. It is found that the Wave Dragon device yields the most promising energy demand coverage and energy output (5 226 to 6 817 MWh/year). Nevertheless, it may require rescaling towards optimal operation, while the OCECO 4 excels in terms of capacity factor (0.24â€“0.29) and default adaptation to the deployment sites. The WaveRollerÂ® has the lowest single-unit cost (125 â‚¬/MWh) but requires up to nine units to cover all the energy demand targets. Larger wave farms are required for the BBDB and AquaBuOY, albeit with potentially greater economies of scale and single-unit redundancy. These sites also enable cultivation of most of the considered species, even under ideal conditions. Lastly, it is recommended that the devices enter survivability mode at a significant wave height threshold of 5.5 m. Â© 2023 The Authors

TI  - Layout optimisation for offshore wind farms
AB  - The first layout for an offshore wind farm is typically required for permit applications and a business case assessment. The design is based on perceived restriction at the site, preliminary site data and current knowledge of the wind market. This layout can remain frozen for many years, during the lengthy development phase. Once permits are granted, there is an excellent opportunity for layout optimisation. The full permit conditions are defined, there may be on-site wind measurements and improved flow modelling, and there are advances in the available technologies on the market. This paper outlines the layout design process for offshore wind farms with several examples of constructed projects. A method for layout optimisation is then presented. First, the optimum wind farm capacity is determined, in terms of the lowest Cost of Energy (e.g. Îµ/MWh). Then, the layout is fine-tuned to minimise wake losses and ensure compliance with permits and wind turbine certification limits. A real-world case study is presented to demonstrate the value of this approach. The Q10 offshore wind farm is being developed by Eneco, at 23 km from shore in the Netherlands. The layout optimisation began with an updated wind resource assessment and an evaluation of the permits to find the key constraints. Four categories of wind turbines were identified in the current offshore wind market, and an optimised layout was designed for each. The final layout of 43 x Vestas V112 - 3 MW wind turbines leads to a reduction in Cost of Energy of over 10%, compared to the initial layout.

TI  - WAVELET TRANSFORMATION ANALYSIS APPLIED TO INCOMPRESSIBLE FLOW FIELD ABOUT A SOLID CYLINDER
AB  - Flows past a circular cylinder develop in a variety of practical situations in engineering and in nature. One can properly focus on the study of beneficial cases and specifically attempt to harness this renewable clean energy resource to generate electrical power to help decrease air pollution and global warming. In addition, we need studies on stress and deformation of a circular cylinder due to the passing flow vortex in order to reduce the destructive effects, for example, on offshore structures. In this paper, we implement a two-dimensional numerical simulation with no-slip walls to monitor in detail how vortices are formed around a stationary circular cylinder when a shear current flows past a bluff body, namely a fixed circular cylinder. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) part of COMSOL Multiphysics was used to implement the continuity and Navier-Stokes equations that are based on the velocity field, pressure, and other preliminary variables. In the research reported here, various mathematical techniques such as various selected wavelet transforms over the space domain are applied to the exported data. A comprehensive wavelet numerical investigation is carried out on the vorticity and pressure field by using MATLAB software. Various Daubechies wavelets, Haar, Morlet, Paul and the m-th order derivative of Gaussian wavelets were tested to find the best wavelet transform to accurately analyze flow past a fixed cylinder. Numerical simulation results are compared with experimental data from the literature. An extensive comparative analysis is performed and discussed in detail in order to suggest improvements and expansions for the developed model. Â© 2021 Begell House Inc.. All rights reserved.

TI  - Extended Environmental Contour Methods for Long-Term Extreme Response Analysis of Offshore Wind Turbines
AB  - Environmental contour method is an efficient method for predicting the long-term extreme response of offshore structures. The traditional environmental contour is obtained using the joint distribution of mean wind speed, significant wave height, and spectral peak period. To improve the accuracy of traditional environmental contour method, a modified method was proposed considering the non-monotonic aerodynamic behavior of offshore wind turbines. Still, the modified method assumes constant wind turbulence intensity. In this paper, we extend the existing environmental contour methods by considering the wind turbulence intensity as a stochastic variable. The 50-year extreme responses of a monopile-based offshore wind turbine are compared using the extended environmental contour methods and the full long-term method. It is found that both the environmental contour method and the modified environmental contour method, with the wind turbulence intensity included as an individual variable, give more accurate predictions compared with those without. Using the full long-term method as a benchmark, this extended approach could reduce the nonconservatism of the environmental contour method and conservatism of the modified environmental contour method. This approach is effective under wind-dominated or combined wind-wave loading conditions, but may not be as important for wave-dominated conditions.

In this scenario, considering the transmission capacity, transmission distance, economy and other requirements, we studied the network topology, the voltage level and the frequency optimization methods of multi-terminal low frequency transmission systems. Then, we proposed multi-terminal low frequency transmission networking mode under the new energy convergence scene. Next, based on the characteristics of the new energy convergence scenario, we study the coordinated control strategy of the multi-terminal low-frequency transmission system, and propose the master-slave control strategy of the multi-terminal low-frequency transmission system. Finally, the simulation model was built in the PSCAD/EMTDC simulation environment, and the simulation verification was carried out to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

AB  - This study aims to assess the wave energy at five coastal stations in the Gulf of Oman using the time series of locally generated wind waves obtained by numerical modeling for 11 years. For this purpose, the spatial, seasonal, monthly, directional, inter-annual of wave energy and power were investigated. The spatial distribution shows that the wave power increases towards the Indian Ocean and the highest mean wave power is located at the eastern station in all seasons. In addition, monthly mean wave power is highest during July and August while the monthly maximum wave power is highest during February at all stations. The ratio of monthly maximum to mean wave power is also the lowest during May to August. Moreover, Monthly Variability Index is the highest in west of the domain where there is no significant wave power potential. In addition, annual wave power as well as total and exploitable wave energies increases from west to east, where the dominant waves propagate from the south, and the exploitable wave energy is approximately 20 times greater than of the central stations.

TI  - Dynamic characteristics analysis of the offshore wind turbine blades
AB  - The topic of offshore wind energy is attracting more and more attention as the energy crisis heightens. The blades are the key components of offshore wind turbines, and their dynamic characteristics directly determine the effectiveness of offshore wind turbines. With different rotating speeds and blade length, the rotating blades generate various centrifugal stiffening effects. To directly analyze the centrifugal stiffening effect of blades, the Rayleigh energy method (REM) was used to derive the natural frequency equation of the blade, including the centrifugal stiffening effect and the axial force calculation formula. The axial force planes and the first to third order natural frequency planes which vary with the rotating speed and length were calculated in three-dimensional coordinates. The centrifugal stiffening coefficient was introduced to quantitatively study the relationship between the centrifugal stiffening degree and the rotating speed, and then the fundamental frequency correction formula was built based on the rotating speed and the blade length. The analysis results show that the calculation results of the fundamental frequency correction formula agree with the theoretical calculation results. The error of calculation results between them is less than 0.5%. Â© 2011 Harbin Engineering University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Energy management system for a hybrid PV-Wind-Tidal-Battery-based islanded DC microgrid: Modeling and experimental validation
AB  - DC microgrids are becoming integral part of a modern power system due to the growing penetration of DC distributed energy resources and loads, with additional advantages in terms of power quality improvement. They can be used for remote area electrification including villages, mountains, and islands. In this paper, an islanded DC microgrid is considered as a case study for islands with tidal energy potential, which consists of renewable energy resources including solar, wind and tidal, along with Li-ion battery storage. To ensure the efficient operation, an optimal energy management system is proposed for resource scheduling and utilization. In this regard, this paper proposes a two-stage supervisory energy management system for optimal operation of PV/Wind/Tidal microgrid with one-time communication to avoid excessive use of communication bandwidth in real-time. The primary stage schedules the optimal energy share from each energy source thereby enhancing the efficiency of the operation. The secondary stage updates the decision strategies by analyzing aggregated scheduled generation and demand profiles to ensure an effective utilization. The proposed energy management model has been experimentally validated to prove its effectiveness in achieving optimized operation for an islanded DC microgrid. Word Count: 4380 Â© 2022

TI  - Macro energy trends and the future of geothermal within the low-carbon energy portfolio
AB  - Exploratory analysis was conducted to understand energy diversification trends within the oil, gas, and power industry and to examine whether geothermal technologies play a role in the low-carbon energy mix. Investigations were completed using the 2018 end of year financial reports for 36 companies. Macro-scale insights reveal a significant split between European and US-based oil and gas companies in terms of strategy which is mirrored by the power companies. Diversification into low-carbon technologies is driving an energy convergence between the oil and gas and power sectors. Presently, the oil and gas industry is not actively investing in geothermal technologies, favoring instead solar photovoltaic (solar PV), onshore/offshore wind, biomass/gas, gas to power and storage. The macro-scale analysis is coupled with, 20, semi-structured interviews with geothermal and energy specialists. The interviews provided an insight why oil and gas companies have resisted entering the geothermal industry. In addition the interviews were organized into a Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and Environmental, PESTLE, analysis to understand the present-day external environment of the geothermal industry in the USA today. The combined analyses indicate that the regulatory, business and finance environment for geothermal, in the USA, is challenging. Recent geothermal innovations that increase the footprint of the geothermal industry, offering new scalable, low-carbon base-load concepts, might provide an avenue for the oil and gas industry to enter the geothermal domain, while leveraging their existing core competencies, intellectual property (IP), technology, assets, and workforce knowledge skills and experience.

TI  - Benthic effects of artificial structures deployed in a tidal estuary
AB  - There has been increased enthusiasm to mitigate the negative effects of fossil fuel consumption through the use of cleaner sources of energy, like marine renewable energy (MRE). Concerns about MRE deployments have motivated research on the ecological effects of these new man-made structures in marine environments. We assessed the extent to which soft-sediment habitats are influenced by the presence of artificial structures deployed in Yaquina Bay, Oregon, USA. Grain size analyses confirmed artificial structures altered the sediment distribution around them with larger grain sizes detected closer to the structures. Infaunal abundances were higher closer to the artificial structures; however, these differences did not result in statistically significant effects on diversity or richness in relation to distance from the structures, nor were they sufficient to cause statistically significant changes in infaunal communities as compared to reference areas. This study provided additional evidence that artificial structures alter their physical environment, but in our study detected differences were less than those observed between the two different regions of the estuary and any effects on infauna were localized and smaller than differences between different regions of the estuary. Conducting these studies in an Oregon estuary provided a good proxy for estimating potential effects of in-stream tidal energy deployments in the Pacific Northwest while also demonstrating the importance of site-specific research.

TI  - Wave loads on a land-based dual-chamber Oscillating Water Column wave energy device
AB  - Wave energy is one of renewable energy resources with great potential. Due to the mechanical and structural simplicity, Oscillating Water Column (OWC) Wave Energy Converter (WEC) is considered to be one of the most promising marine renewable energy devices. However, OWC remains not commercialized mainly due to its complex hydrodynamic performance and uncertainty in wave loads. In the present study, based on potential flow theory and time-domain higher-order boundary element method (HOBEM), a fully nonlinear numerical model is developed and used to investigate the wave-induced force and bending moment on a land-fixed dual-chamber OWC device. The Bernoulli equation is used to calculate the wave force and bending moment. The equation is modified by accounting for the pneumatic pressure in the air chamber and the viscosity effect and then solved using an acceleration-potential method. The numerical model was compared with the experiment carried out in a wave-current flume at the State Key Laboratory of Coastal and Offshore Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, China, and good agreement between the simulation and experimental results was observed. The horizontal components of wave forces on the two curtain walls of the dual-chamber OWC WEC were found to be much larger than the corresponding vertical components. The seaside curtain wall suffered much larger wave loads in comparison with the inner curtain wall. Therefore, the wave force on the seaside curtain wall is the dominant force. The largest wave-induced bending moment occurs at the joint of device and seabed. The effects of the sub-chamber width ratio and curtain-wall draft on the wave-induced force and bending moment are investigated. The dominant wave force and moment increase with curtain wall draft. And the peak wave loads can be reduced by moving the internal curtain wall close to the seaside curtain wall. Â© 2020 The Authors

TI  - FLOATING TYPE OCEAN WAVE POWER STATION (WELLS TYPE RUNNER WORK SUBMERGED IN SEAWATER)
AB  - The authors have invented the unique ocean wave power station, which is composed of the floating type platform with a pair of floats lining up at the interval of one wave pitch and the counter-rotating type wave power unit boarding on the middle position of the platform. Such profiles may make the flow velocity at the runner twice faster than that of the traditional fixed type (OWC). The counter-rotating type wave power unit is composed of the tandem runners submerged in the seawater and the peculiar generator with double rotational armatures. The tandem runners counter-rotate in keeping each rotational direction constant, even at the oscillating flow, where the relative rotational speed is also twice faster than that in the single runner/armature type. It can be expected to make the runner size larger, namely the output higher because the torques are counter balanced in the unit and never act on the platform. At preliminary research, the single stage Wells type runner was boarded on the above platform, while the behavior of the platform and the performance of the power unit were investigated experimentally. The runner works fruitfully in response to the oscillating platform.

TI  - Nonlinear wave energy dissipator with wave attenuation and energy harvesting at low frequencies
AB  - It is important to determine how to reduce the wave load and utilize the ocean energy through the hybrid wave attenuation and energy harvesting structure (WAAEHS) as it is the basic scientific problem in the field of ocean engineering. The existing linear hybrid devices have poor performance due to the mismatch between the natural frequency and the excitation frequency in the low frequency region. The method of increasing the mass is unreliable and low economic, and the introduction of nonlinear mechanism to reduce the stiffness has complex fluid-structure coupling problem between waves and structures. In this paper, a new type of negative stiffness mechanism with a simple structure and good stability has been proposed and applied to a hybrid WAAEHS, and a nonlinear frequency domain method combining eigenfunction expansion matching method(EEMM)and multi-harmonic balance method(MHBM) has been proposed to solve the nonlinear waveâ€“structure interaction dynamic model. The influence of the key parameters of the mechanism on the wave attenuation and energy harvesting performance is examined, and the â€œphase controlâ€ mechanism of the negative stiffness mechanism is revealed to improve the low-frequency wave attenuation and energy harvesting performance.

TI  - Response control of fixed offshore structure with wind turbine using MR damper
AB  - Due to the depletion of fossil fuels, offshore wind turbines have become significant contributors to energy production. The offshore wind turbines are subjected to severe environmental loads like wind, wave, and current. The combined effect of these loads induces significant vibrations in the structure, which may cause economic loss and reduce the power production capacity. Thus, the structure is designed to have a small response under environmental load, but it also increases the cost. Another alternative to reduce the structure's response is implementing structural control devices. MR dampers are semi-active devices widely used in controlling onshore structures because of their adaptability to various loads. Since the environmental loads on the wind turbine have a wide range of spectral content, semi-active control is best suited due to their adaptability. The force generated by the MR damper is enormous for small input energy, and thus it is an attractive option for adaptive structural control in civil structures. Several semi-active control algorithms are available in the literature for nonlinear MR dampers. The semi-active algorithm obtains the optimal control force of the linearized system and smartly switches off the MR damper according to the system requirement. The offshore structure is nonlinear, so a nonlinear control algorithm is expected to have advantage over other techniques. One of the commonly used nonlinear control algorithms is the backstepping method. This method involves a systematic development of the Lyapunov function for a given nonlinear system. The nonlinearity in the MR damper arises due to the hysteretic property of the MR fluid. Many phenomenological models are studied in the literature to capture MR dampers' nonlinearities effectively. Bouc wen model is one such model that is widely used for modeling MR dampers.The backstepping controller requires full state feedback to produce the control signal but measuring many variables is difficult in real-time. Some controllers do not require an accurate structure model, and the control action is based on the measured response. This paper uses the feed-forward neural network controller (NNC) to control nonlinear dynamic systems. The controller is trained using the displacement time histories of the structure to predict the MR damper voltage. The NNC is trained with the output from the backstepping controller for various environmental conditions. In this study, a fixed offshore wind turbine in a water depth of 64.5m is controlled using NNC and backstepping controllers. Further, the control efficiency of the NNC is compared for different load cases. Â© 2022 IEEE.

TI  - Study on the dynamic response of floating wind turbines
AB  - Floating wind turbine is a new type of wind turbine. Under the coupled effect of wind and wave, dynamic responses of the kinetic and aerodynamic parameters will be significant. In this paper, with the help of an Aero-Hydro-Servo-Elastic fully coupled software, the dynamic responses of three typical floating wind turbines, under different wind and wave conditions, were calculated and analyzed. The results show that: the dynamic responses of the three types of floating wind turbines are different, but the surge motion is always predominant; the mean surge is mainly affected by wind speed, and the surge amplitude is mainly affected by wave height; the mean rotor power is almost the same as the steady value of bottom-fixed wind turbine, but the mean load has a large increment.

TI  - Sound exposure in harbour seals during the installation of an offshore wind farm: predictions of auditory damage
AB  - With ambitious renewable energy targets, pile driving associated with offshore wind farm construction will become widespread in the marine environment. Many proposed wind farms overlap with the distribution of seals, and sound from pile driving has the potential to cause auditory damage. We report on a behavioural study during the construction of a wind farm using data from GPS/GSM tags on 24 harbour seals Phoca vitulina L. Pile driving data and acoustic propagation models, together with seal movement and dive data, allowed the prediction of auditory damage in each seal. Growth and recovery functions for auditory damage were combined to predict temporary auditory threshold shifts in each seal. Further, M-weighted cumulative sound exposure levels [}cSELs(M-pw)] were calculated and compared to permanent auditory threshold shift exposure criteria for pinnipeds in water exposed to pulsed sounds. The closest distance of each seal to pile driving varied from 47 to 405km, and predicted maximum cSELs(M-pw) ranged from 1707 to 1953 dB re 1Pa(2)-s for individual seals. Comparison to exposure criteria suggests that half of the seals exceeded estimated permanent auditory damage thresholds. Prediction of auditory damage in marine mammals is a rapidly evolving field and has a number of key uncertainties associated with it. These include how sound propagates in shallow water environments and the effects of pulsed sounds on seal hearing; as such, our predictions should be viewed in this context.Policy implications. We predicted that half of the tagged seals received sound levels from pile driving that exceeded auditory damage thresholds for pinnipeds. These results have implications for offshore industry and will be important for policymakers developing guidance for pile driving. Developing engineering solutions to reduce sound levels at source or methods to deter animals from damage risk zones, or changing temporal patterns of piling could potentially reduce auditory damage risk. Future work should focus on validating these predictions by collecting auditory threshold information pre- and post-exposure to pile driving. Ultimately, information on population-level impacts of exposure to pile driving is required to ensure that offshore industry is developed in an environmentally sustainable manner.

TI  - Experimental study on scour profile of pile-supported horizontal axis tidal current turbine
AB  - The study aims to investigate the influence of tip clearance on the scour rate of pile-supported horizontal axis tidal current turbine (TCT) and also attempts to correlate time-dependent scour depth of TCT with the tip clearance. A physical model of TCT was placed in a flume for scour test and the scour rate of the fabricated model was investigated. The results suggest that the decrease in tip clearance increases the scour depth. In addition, the shortest tip clearance results in the fastest and most sediment transport. The maximum scour depth reached 18.5\% of rotor diameter. Results indicate that regions susceptible to scour typically persist up to 1.0D(t) downstream and up to 0.5D(t) to either side of the turbine support centre. The majority of the scour occurred in the first 3.5 h. The maximum scour depth reaches equilibrium after 24 h test. An empirical formula to predict the time-dependent scour depth of pile-supported TCT is proposed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - PROBABILISTIC APPROACH TO DETERMINE THE EFFICIENCY OF OCEAN WAVE ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEMS
AB  - Recently, several research studies are being conducted on Ocean Wave Energy Conversion (OWEC) systems that convert wave motion into electricity. The efficiency of OWEC systems is a parameter of great significance. Thus, it is important to consider factors that affect the efficiency of the system, such as ocean wave properties, airflow characteristics of the OWEC systems, and manufacturing inaccuracies. However, these parameters have inherent uncertainties, which should not be disregarded. Without considering these uncertainties, the feasibility assessment of an OWEC system can be misleading. For this study, the following research question was developed: can probabilistic analysis be used to determine the reliability of the efficiency of the OWEC system? To answer this research question, the specific aims developed were: (1) to quantify the uncertainties of the input parameters, and (2) to determine the reliability of efficiency of the OWEC system. The reliability of the efficiency of the system was calculated probabilistically. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the random variable that had the most impact on the reliability of the efficiency of the OWEC system. Advanced Mean Value (AMV) method was used to determine the probability of failure. NESSUS software was used to perform the probabilistic analysis. In order to assess the reliability of the system, a target efficiency was set and the probability of achieving this efficiency under uncertain input conditions was investigated. The deterministic and probabilistic results were also compared. The results showed that, probabilistic analysis approach can reveal the reliability of the system efficiency by accounting for the wave parameter and manufacturing uncertainties. Moreover, sensitivity analysis showed the variables that had the most impact on reliability of efficiency.

TI  - Technical aspects of status and expected future trends for wind power in Denmark
AB  - The power system of Denmark is characterized by significant incorporation of wind power. Presently, more than 20% of the annual electricity consumption is covered by electricity-producing wind turbines. The largest increase in grid-incorporated wind power is expected to come from large (offshore) wind farms operating as large wind power plants with ride-through solutions, connected to the high-voltage transmission system and providing ancillary services to the system. In Denmark there are presently two offshore wind farms connected to the transmission system: Horns Rev A (160MW rated power in the western part of the country) and Nysted(165 MW rated power at RÃ¸dsand in Eastern Denmark). The construction of two more offshore wind farms, totalling 400MW by the years 2008-2010, has been announced.

TI  - Study on hydrodynamic performance of a horizontal axis tidal turbine with a lobed ejector
AB  - Tidal turbine is a device that converts the kinetic energy of water into electrical energy. Although tidal energy resources are abundant, the energy acquisition efficiency of actual tidal turbines designed by traditional methods is limited due to the Beta theory. A horizontal axis tidal turbine with a lobed ejector was designed to efficiently utilize tidal energy by taking into consideration the effect of the lobed ejector. The optimal Latin hypercube design method (OLHD) was used to extract sample points for the geometric parameters of the lobed ejector. Then response surface methodology was used for the optimal design of the power coefficient, the main index of the hydraulic performance of tidal turbine. The CFD simulation results show that after optimizing the geometric parameters of the lobed ejector, the power coefficient of the turbine increases by 98.88%. Therefore, it is concluded that the proposed horizontal axis tidal turbine with a lobed ejector can be used for the efficient utilization of tidal energy. Optimizing the geometric parameters of the lobed ejector is beneficial to significantly improve the power coefficient of the turbine, and is more conducive to the actual power generation, which has certain engineering significance.

TI  - Slamming force contribution due to plunging breakers on circular, square and diamond cylinders
AB  - Plunging breakers, unlike non-breaking waves, impose additional slamming load on the offshore structures. This additional slamming load is considered an extreme event and is one of the most devastating forces that an offshore structure could encounter during its operational lifecycle. Whilst there are design guidelines for offshore structures pertaining to breaking waves, however it is limited to only cylindrical shape. The amount of slamming load contribution by the plunging jet is also dependent on the cross section geometries of the offshore structures. Different geometries would give rise to different air entrainment phenomenon during wave breaking and therefore affecting the slamming load contributions. In this research, JONSWAP spectrum was used to create plunging breakers via the focusing method at Newcastle Universityâ€™s Wind Wave and Current tank. The crux of this research is to investigate the wave-breaking impact load on cylindrical structures with different cross section geometries commonly used in the offshore industry.

AB  - Sima Charters' CEO Ruud Lievaart set about creating a new generation of vessel to perform services such as survey work, small supply work or crew transport to offshore wind farms, incorporating all the experience gained at sea over the years: the MPT 65. SC Amethyst is the first vessel of this series. With an increasing amount of charter jobs further afield, the living space aboard has become very important, so for SC Amethyst, the crew quarters have received a significant upgrade. Three comfortable cabins are provided below the main deck, along with a two bathrooms and a spacious crew mess. A safe crew transfer at a wind turbine is all about creating enough friction between the boat's fender and the wind turbine's tube structure around the ladder. When a boat is rolling, this contact is constantly challenged, and hence more horsepower is needed to keep the bow stuck.

AB  - This paper examines the application of solar energy and the role that solar energy can play to enhance information and communication technology (ICT) usage in coastal areas in Bangladesh. The empirical data were collected using interview and focus group discussions (FGD) in two unions on the coastal island of Kutubdia. The results of the analysis indicate that coastal areas have witnessed an accelerated shift towards solar technology to meet the gap between the demand for and the supply of electricity, along with other energy sources. The access to ICT tools in local communities has risen, with infrastructure which has completely changed the coastal way of life. It concludes that the use of ICT-based devices has opened a new window for remote communities, where solar energy has made great contributions. Therefore, a comprehensive approach is needed for people across the country to encourage and support them to use solar-based electricity. Â© KONINKLIJKE BRILL NV, LEIDEN, 2019.

TI  - Evaluation of a model for predicting the tidal velocity in fjord entrances
AB  - Sufficiently accurate and low-cost estimation of tidal velocities is of importance when evaluating a potential site for a tidal energy farm. Here we suggest and evaluate a model to calculate the tidal velocity in fjord entrances. The model is compared with tidal velocities from Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements in the tidal channel Skarpsundet in Norway. The calculated velocity value from the model corresponded well with the measured cross-sectional average velocity, but was shown to underestimate the velocity in the centre of the channel. The effect of this was quantified by calculating the kinetic energy of the flow for a 14-day period. A numerical simulation using TELEMAC-2D was performed and validated with ADCP measurements. Velocity data from the simulation was used as input for calculating the kinetic energy at various locations in the channel. It was concluded that the model presented here is not accurate enough for assessing the tidal energy resource. However, the simplicity of the model was considered promising in the use of finding sites where further analyses can be made. Â© 2013 by the authors.

TI  - A coordinated control strategy for hybrid offshore renewable energy power generation considering state of charge of battery energy storage system
AB  - In view of the fact that hybrid offshore renewable energy power generation system is composed of offshore wind power generation, wave power generation and tidal power generation and they are integrated as a whole, there is considerable random fluctuation in the output power of the hybrid generation system. To reduce the affection of power fluctuation on power grid the battery energy storage system is adopted to smooth the output power of the hybrid generation system. On this basis, considering the state of charge of batteries, a coordinated control strategy, which can keep output power of the hybrid generation system as smooth as possible and prevent the over-charging/over-discharging of batteries in the meantime, is proposed. When the state of charge of batteries is maintained in the normal level, the power fluctuation can be suppressed by the charging/discharging of batteries; when over-charging of batteries occurs, output power of generators can be reduced by the coordinated control of overspeed and pitch-varying of wind turbines and tidal generation units; when over-discharging of batteries occurs, the normal working state of batteries can be recovered by reducing the output power setting at grid-side. Results of calculation example show that the proposed coordinated control strategy is correct and effective.

TI  - A methodology to determine the power performance of wave energy converters at a particular coastal location
AB  - The assessment of the power performance of a wave energy converter (WEC) at a given site involves two tasks: (i) the characterisation of the wave resource at the site in question, and (ii) the computation of its power performance. These tasks are generally seen as disconnected, and tackled as such; they are, however, deeply interrelated - so much so that they should be treated as two phases of the same procedure. Indeed, beyond the characterisation of the wave resource of a certain area lies a crucial question: how much power would a WEC installed in that area output to the network? This work has two main objectives. First, to develop a methodology that integrates both tasks seamlessly and guarantees the accurate computation of the power performance of a WEC installed at a site of interest; it involves a large dataset of deepwater records and the implementation of a high-resolution, nested spectral model, which is used to propagate 95\% of the total offshore wave energy to the WEC site. The second objective is to illustrate this methodology with a case study: an Oscillating Water Column (OWC) projected to be constructed at the breakwater of A Guarda (NW Spain). It is found that the approach presented allows to accurately determine the power that the WEC will output to the network, and that this power exhibits a significant monthly variability, so an estimate of the energy production based on mean annual values may be misleading.

Measurements taken included the overall performance of the turbine as well as detailed measurements of the radial distribution of velocity and pressure, upstream, downstream and between the rotor planes, for two different solidity turbine models and different rotor speed ratios. Experimental results show that the use of two twin rotors rotating in the opposite direction to each other is an efficient means of recovering the swirl kinetic energy without the use of guide vanes. Also, it was shown that the stall could be postponed by increasing the velocity of the downstream rotor relative to that of the upstream rotor.

TI  - Bragg resonance of gravity waves and ocean renewable energy
AB  - Here we study Bragg resonance of surface and interfacial waves. Specifically, we show one triad resonance between two surface waves and one seabed component in a homogeneous fluid, and another triad between a surface wave, an interfacial wave and a bottom component in a two-layer density stratified fluid. Via the Bragg resonance between two surface waves in a homogeneous fluid we can transfer the energy of one wave to another wave with the same frequency that moves in a different direction. We use this type of Bragg resonance to design lenses and curved mirrors for gravity waves. These lenses and mirrors are merely small changes to the seabed topography (e.g. by placing obstacles) and hence are surface non-invasive. By a concave mirror or a convex lens of gravity waves, we can focus gravity waves at a specific location. This may be of interest to the ocean wave energy, as instead of putting a multitude of wave energy harvesting devices over a large area, one large wave energy absorber can be placed at the focal point. This will reduce the cost, increase the efficiency and is clearly more environmentally friendly. We also show that Bragg resonance of surface and interfacial waves can be used to transfer energy from surface waves to interfacial waves, and from interfacial waves to the surface waves. Therefore in a two-layer density stratified fluid a proper architecture of the topography can be used to create a buffer zone which is protected from surface waves. This idea, known as cloaking, can protect floating offshore wind towers from the momentum of oceanic waves. Â© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - The wakes induced by the wind turbines are modeled with the finite-volume code WindSim, based on the solving of the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations of an Atmospheric Boundary Layer. The RANS equations of an uncompressible flow are solved with a multigrid coupled solver (MIGAL); turbulence is closed with the RNG k-epsilon model. The rotor of a wind turbine is modeled by an actuator disc providing a resistive force which is calculated from the thrust coefficient curve of wind turbine. The axial thrust can be distributed over the swept area in three different manners: by a uniform, parabolic or a polynomial distribution. A wake is therefore generated downstream of each turbine with wake deficit and induced turbulence. When using the actuator disc technique it is also interesting to observe how the wake-wake, wake-terrain interactions are predicted; moreover, also simulations with actuator discs and flows with thermal effects can be carried out. In this work we present first a series of simulations over a single turbine for a grid sensitivity study, in the second part a validation against production data from the offshore wind farm Horns Rev is presented.

TI  - Electromagnetic Spring for Sliding Wave Energy Converter
AB  - We propose a Linear Sliding Wave Energy Converter (LS-WEC) to power ocean buoys by wave energy harvesting. The concept involves a linear translator and a rotary generator that roll and pitch in ocean waves. The translator is a steel mass that is supported by wheels on rails with low-friction bearings. The translator linear motion is converted to rotary motion to spin an electric generator using a set of rack and pinion gears. The rack is fixed to the translator; the pinion is coupled to the generator shaft. An ``electromagnetic spring (eSpring){''} is implemented by using the generator as a motor and performing feedback control of the translator displacement. With variable stiffness, the eSpring tunes the system in resonance with changing ocean wave motions in order to maximize the power harvested. We derive the dynamic system fundamentals, which indicate a large ``effective mass{''} associated with the polar moment of inertia of the generator rotor. We calculate power-harvesting performance by numerical simulations in sinusoidal and random waves, with and without an eSpring. The results show that without an eSpring the power decreases proportionally with the effective mass, but with the eSpring, the system uses the effective mass to store energy that is extracted by the generator. For a 3-m long LS-WEC with a 30-kg translator mass in swell conditions (1.25-m wave-height and 5-s period), the average power is 2.3w and 17.8w without and with the eSpring, respectively.

TI  - Design and Analysis of Tri Core Permanent Magnet Linear Generator for Wave Energy Conversion in South Coast of Java Island
AB  - The south coast of Java Island has significant wave height that allows for wave energy to electric energy conversion. Wave energy converter using permanent magnet linear generator (PMLG) attracting more attention due to its efficiency of the generator and the elimination of translational to rotational motion converter in the generator, but PMLG suffer from electric power losses in the winding. In this paper, a tri core PMLG design which has minimum electric power losses is proposed. The electric power losses in the winding are ideally minimized using simulated annealing algorithm. Then, finite element analysis is used to analyze and verify the proposed design of PMLG. The small scale optimum design of this PMLG is simulated using an oscillating water column (OWC) chamber to analyze and investigate the performance of this linear generator. Simulation result shows that PMLG has a good efficiency and confirm the capability of this PMLG installed with OWC chamber in the south coast of Java Island.

TI  - Modeling large offshore wind farms under different atmospheric stability regimes with the Park wake model
AB  - We evaluate a modified version of the Park wake model against power data from a west-east row in the middle of the Horns Rev I offshore wind farm. The evaluation is performed on data classified in four different atmospheric stability conditions, for a narrow wind speed range, and a wide range of westerly wind directions observed at the wind farm. Simulations (post-processed to partly account for the wind direction uncertainty) and observations show good agreement for all stability classes, being the simulations using a stability-dependent wake decay coefficient closer to the data for the last turbines on the row and those using the WAsP recommended value closer to the data for the first turbines. It is generally seen that under stable and unstable atmospheric conditions the power deficits are the highest and lowest, respectively, but the wind conditions under both stability regimes are different. The ensemble average of the simulations does not approach the limits of the infinite wind farm under any stability condition as such averages account for directions misaligned with the row.

TI  - The design and deployment of a real-time wide spectrum acoustic monitoring system for the ocean energy industry
AB  - A distributed real-time system for monitoring and characterizing the underwater soundscape is presented in the context of environmental impact baseline assessment for the ocean energy industry. We discuss the development and deployment of an offshore acoustic monitoring buoy with real-time acoustic signal transmission capabilities and an accompanying sea floor-based sensor platform utilizing hydrophone and particle velocity detector technologies. In addition, high bandwidth point-to-point communications for the buoy to shore communications and data streaming architectures with failover protection in a high speed networking environment are described. An integrated stream analytical processing platform has been developed for the real-time signal processing of multiple high bandwidth acoustic data streams in parallel that incorporates multiple preprocessing steps as well as event detection and classification techniques. Real-time dynamic filtering approaches are also being developed using supplemental data such as sea state and weather to compensate for varying environmental conditions. These technologies are being incorporated in the Marine Institute of Ireland's multipurpose research and development SmartBay Ireland system, which provides a flexible and agile monitoring and management platform that is being extended to include additional environmental variables relevant to the ocean energy domain. The platform is deployed for the Galway Bay Quarter Scale Wave Energy Test Site and will capture, store, and analyze one year of continuous acoustic data., Â© 2013 IEEE.

TI  - Aerodynamic study of a self-rectifying impulse turbine based on OWC wave energy prototype
AB  - Many countries of the world fulfill their power requirements through non-renewable energy resources which include fossil fuels, earth minerals and nuclear fuels. The massive use of these non-renewable energy resources has created an alarming situation resulting in harmful climatic variation throughout the world. So, the need of hour is to focus on sustainable and clean renewable energy resources to fulfill energy demands. In this regard, the ocean waves are considered significant renewable energy resource to extract the energy from sea waves. This research paper represents the parametric investigation of wave energy model based on oscillating water column technique. Self-rectifying impulse turbine of specific design parameters is used in this research work to convert maximum wave energy into mechanical energy. Designing of turbine blade, guide wave geometry and oscillating water column is performed on CREO and Pro-Engineer. While FEM software Gambit and Fluent are used to achieve fine meshing and profiles of tangential and radial velocity. Maximum efficiency attained from this designed wave energy model is 35%, while rpms of shaft are calculated 200. This paper realizes the fact that wave energy has a lot of potential for research.

TI  - Estimating the value of offshore wind along the United States' Eastern Coast
AB  - Offshore wind power deployment has been concentrated in Europe, and remains limited in other areas of the world. Among the many challenges to deployment is the need to understand the value that offshore wind provides within electricity markets. This article develops a rigorous method to assess the economic value of offshore wind along the eastern coastline of the United States, seeking improved understanding of how the value of offshore wind varies both geographically and over time, and what has driven that variation. The article uses historical (2007-2016) weather data at thousands of potential offshore wind sites, combined with historical wholesale electricity market outcomes and renewable energy certificate (REC) prices at hundreds of possible transmission interconnection points. We find that the average historical market value of offshore wind from 2007 to 2016 - considering energy, capacity, and RECs - varies significantly by project location, from $40/MWh to more than $110/MWh, and is highest for sites off of New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. As energy and REC prices have fallen in recent years, so too has the market value of offshore wind. The historical value of offshore wind is found to exceed that of onshore wind, due to offshore wind sites being located more favorably in terms of constrained pricing points, and also due to a more-favorable temporal profile of electricity production. Cost reductions that approximate those witnessed recently in Europe may be needed for offshore wind to offer a credible economic value proposition on a widespread basis in the United States.

TI  - Performance assessment of the CECO wave energy converter: Water depth influence
AB  - CECO is a recently proposed Wave Energy Converter (WEC), which harnesses both the kinetic and potential energy of waves. Currently, CECO is at the third level of technology readiness (TRL3). In this context, maximising the wave energy absorption under a wide range of wave conditions is crucial for the future development of the device. Therefore, this work aims to explore in detail the main parameters (operating water depth and wave conditions) that influence CECO's performance in terms of Captured Energy (CE) and Captured Energy Efficiency (CEEff). For this purpose, a panel-based model, which was calibrated from previous physical model tests was used to construct the CECO matrices of absorbed wave power at different operating water depths. The wave conditions of the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula (2005-2014), which were modelled using SWAN, were used as case study. Overall, CECO offers promising results for CE and CEEff, reaching values up to 600 MWh and 45\%, respectively. In addition, it was found that CECO's power absorption reaches its maximum for values of peak wave periods (T-p) ranging from 10 to 13 s and the fact that the operating water depth does not impact significantly the performance of the device.

TI  - Spatialâ€“temporal estimation and analysis of japan onshore and offshore wind energy potential
AB  - In the carbon-neutral scenarios fixed by most developed countries, wind and solar resources play a significant role due to their substantial potential. Their instability can be mitigated through smarter designs of energy systems, including sector coupling and cross-border interconnections, which require detailed information on the spatial and temporal evolution of these intermittent resources. The present study aims at estimating the spatialâ€“temporal energy potential of wind in Japan based on meteorological weather data. These data allow to analyze the potential of resources sharing to reduce power generationâ€™s lack and excess, even in such an isolated country due to its variety of climate conditions and local energy demand. The correlation skewness is introduced as a measure of the sitesâ€™ uniqueness to identify important sites for the spatial distribution of capacity toward the efficient stabilization of supply at a national scale in a model-free fashion.

TI  - Electrical systems for offshore windfarms
AB  - Offshore wind farms are different from onshore wind farms in many respects and so the usual ways of thinking about the electrical aspects may not be appropriate. Clearly costs will be higher than on land. However, reliability and availability are also much more important, because faults may be more frequent and could take much longer to locate and repair. Unlike onshore:public transmission and distribution networks, the relatively low capacity factors are likely to make full redundancy uneconomic. The restricted space and high cost of support structures offshore conflict with the need for additional switchgear to isolate faulty equipment. Within the offshore wind farm, the regular array may produce electrical system configurations different from the radial system typical of onshore wind farms. The wind farm monitoring or SCADA system also needs to be reconsidered.

TI  - Numerical prediction of the hydrodynamic performance of a horizontal tidal turbines
AB  - Tidal current energy is one of the most promising renewable energy resources. The prediction of the hydrodynamic loads and power efficiency are the critical issues for verifying the new designs. Besides, Optimization of turbine arrangement is important for a tidal turbine farm. The hydrodynamic behavior of a turbine operating in the wake of an upstream turbine needs to clarify. In this paper we present a CFD approach in which the CFD library of OpenFOAM is utilized for prediction of the performance of a three bladed horizontal axis tidal turbine (HATT) in a test tunnel environment. The Reynolds Average Navier Stokes (RANS) equation with Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model is applied. The steady-state solver is tested for present numerical simulation. The Multi Reference Framework (MRF) method is adopted for dealing with grid relative rotation. Turbulence models effects and the mesh generation are well described. The resultant power and thrust coefficients of these simulations are compared with experimental results at various tip speed ratios (TSRs). Â© 2015 by ASME.

TI  - Global performance of a KRISO semisubmersible multiunit floating offshore wind turbine: Numerical simulation vs. model test
AB  - The global performance of the KRISO square-type semisubmersible multiunit floating offshore wind turbine (MUFOWT) in irregular waves is numerically simulated by using a multiturbine floater-mooring coupled dynamic analysis program. The developed time-domain numerical-simulation tool is extended from the FASTâ€“CHARM3D coupled dynamics program for a single turbine on a single floater. FAST has been developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for years for the single unit. Recently, KRISO has designed and studied a square-type semisubmersible MUFOWT in which four 3 MW wind turbines are installed at each corner of a single floater. Additionally, 24 point-power-absorber-type linear-generator-based wave energy converters are set up, with six wave energy converters at each side of the platform. For verification, KRISO performed a series of model tests for this MUFOWT with 1:50 Froude scale. In this paper, the MUFOWT simulation program is used to reproduce KRISOâ€™s model test results. In the fully-coupled multiturbine/hull/mooring dynamic simulations, the complete second-order difference-frequency wave forces are also included. The analysis results are systematically compared with the model test results, which shows reasonable correlation between them. Â© The International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers.

TI  - Modeling and simulation of wind-wave energy hybrid power system based on hydraulic transmission
AB  - Hydraulic transmission technology has been used widely in ocean energy power generation. This article designs a hybrid power system of wind-wave energy based on hydraulic transmission. The simulation model was built by Matlab/Simulink software and AMESim software to analyze the working condition of the system. Through analyzing the curve, we can get the conclusion: when the power decreases captured by the wind turbine, the wave converter can supply the shortage of the power. And the speed, the rate of flow and the output power of the hydraulic motor are steady under the action of accumulator. Finally, the simulation result validates the feasibility of hydraulic transmission system, which is part of the wind-wave energy hybrid power system.

TI  - Numerical simulation of dynamics of a spar type floating wind turbine and comparison with laboratory measurements
AB  - Wind turbines are popular for harnessing wind energy. Floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT) installed in relatively deep water may have advantages over their on-land or shallowwater cousins because winds over deep water are usually steadier and stronger. As the size of wind turbines becomes larger and larger for reducing the cost per kilowatt, it could bring installation and operation risks in the deep water due to the lack of track records. Thus, together with laboratory tests, numerical simulations of dynamics of FOWT are desirable to reduce the probability of failure. In this study, COUPLE-FAST was initially employed for the numerical simulations of the OC3-HYWIND, a spar type platform equipped with the 5-MW baseline wind turbine proposed by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The model tests were conducted at the Deepwater Offshore Basin in Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) with a 1:50 Froude scaling [1]. In comparison of the simulation using COUPLE-FAST with the corresponding measurements, it was found that the predicted motions were in general significantly smaller than the related measurements. The main reason is that the wind loads predicted by FAST were well below the related measurements. Large discrepancies are expected because the prototype and laboratory wind loads do not follow Froude number similarity although the wind speed was increased (or decreased) in the tests such that the mean surge wind force matched that predicted by FAST at the nominal wind speed (Froude similarity) in the cases of a land wind turbine [1]. Therefore, an alternative numerical simulation was made by directly inputting the measured wind loads to COUPLE instead of the ones predicted by FAST. The related simulated results are much improved and in satisfactory agreement with the measurements. Â© Copyright 2016 by ASME.

TI  - Power flow calculation of hybrid AC/DC power systems
AB  - Multi-terminal HVDC systems have recently become an attractive option for interconnection of isolated AC systems such as offshore wind farms and oil platforms to asynchronous large AC systems. This paper deals with power flow calculation (PFC) of hybrid AC/DC power systems where several asynchronous AC systems are interconnected via a common multiterminal VSC-HVDC system. This paper proposes a unified AC-DC approach for PFC of a hybrid AC/DC power system. The proposed approach is then employed for two different analyses, namely a) the separated analysis where the entire hybrid AC/DC system is divided into two groups. The first group (named external AC system) comprises all asynchronous AC systems which are not directly connected to the slack convertor of the DC network, and the second group comprises an AC/DC system where the selected AC system is directly connected to the slack convertor. In this method, a PFC is firstly performed for the the first group, and its relevant obtained results will be used for PFC of the second group. b) the integrated analysis where the entire hybrid system is considered as a unit. Both a) and b) can be used in the practical analysis of the real-size power systems. However, due to practical issues and computational costs the separated analysis may be a more acceptable method. The simulations have been performed using MATLAB, and the obtained results have been compared with those obtained in SIMPOW. Â© 2012 IEEE.

TI  - Irregular wave validation of a coupling methodology for numerical modelling of near and far field effects of wave energy converter arrays
AB  - Between the Wave Energy Converters (WECs) of a farm, hydrodynamic interactions occur and have an impact on the surrounding wave field, both close to the WECs (â€œnear fieldâ€ effects) and at large distances from their location (â€œfar fieldâ€ effects). To simulate this â€œfar fieldâ€ impact in a fast and accurate way, a generic coupling methodology between hydrodynamic models has been developed by the Coastal Engineering Research Group of Ghent University in Belgium. This coupling methodology has been widely used for regular waves. However, it has not been developed yet for realistic irregular sea states. The objective of this paper is to present a validation of the novel coupling methodology for the test case of irregular waves, which is demonstrated here for coupling between the mild slope wave propagation model, MILDwave, and the â€˜Boundary Element Methodâ€™-based waveâ€“structure interaction solver, NEMOH. MILDwave is used to model WEC farm â€œfar fieldâ€ effects, while NEMOH is used to model â€œnear fieldâ€ effects. The results of the MILDwave-NEMOH coupled model are validated against numerical results from NEMOH, and against the WECwakes experimental data for a single WEC, and for WEC arrays of five and nine WECs. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between disturbance coefficient (Kd) values in the entire numerical domain (RMSE Kd ,D ) are used for evaluating the performed validation. The RMSE Kd ,D between results from the MILDwave-NEMOH coupled model and NEMOH is lower than 2.0% for the performed test cases, and between the MILDwave-NEMOH coupled model and the WECwakes experimental data RMSE Kd ,D remains below 10%. Consequently, the efficiency is demonstrated of the coupling methodology validated here which is used to simulate WEC farm impact on the wave field under the action of irregular waves.

TI  - A novel methodology for effective short-circuit calculation in offshore wind power plants considering converter limitations
AB  - This paper deals with the short-circuit calculation of offshore wind power plants (OWPPs). The short-circuit calculation presented in this paper assumes the studied system achieves a new equilibrium state during the fault. The studied system is modeled with an element-based steady-state formulation where the grid-support control and potential current-saturated operation of wind turbine (WT) converters are included. In particular, the current-saturation modifies the converter control and represents various potential operation states of the converter. Then, an iterative methodology is proposed to identify the short-circuit equilibrium point that satisfies convertersâ€™ limitations and to obtain the current-saturation states of all power converters with a specific fault scenario in the studied system. The numerical case studies indicate that the WT converters operation has a significant influence to the system equilibrium point during the fault. In addition, the presented methodology is efficient for short-circuit calculation of a large-scale OWPP. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Renewable energy power reverse osmosis system for seawater desalination plant
AB  - This project focused on the latest developments in the renewable energy to power a small reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plant which provided a small group of people with freshwater in a remote area in Egypt. The aim of this work is to estimate an optimum energy system required for a water treatment plant that produces 125 L/h (3 m3/d) at constant daily load profile using one of the renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. First of all, the power required for the reverse osmosis plant to produce 3 m3 of freshwater per day had been calculated manually and the total plant design had been performed using water application value engine (WAVE) software presented by DOW water and process solutions company. Secondly, for solar and wind energy, PVSyst V6.75 software and manual calculations were used to estimate the daily energy production. Of course solar and wind energy are clean, free, and renewable sources of energy, it depends on the site loca-tion. As Egypt has its long coastline, it is highly recommended as a perfect location for desalination plants powered by renewable energy sources. Mersa Matruh governorate was assumed in this study to be the location of the plant. Â© 2020 Desalination Publications. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessing the impact of electricity interconnections to achieve the EU targets for CO2 emissions reduction
AB  - The low interconnection capacities between EU countries has been identified as one of the main issues with the development of an electricity system relying mainly on renewable energy sources. This research work explores the impacts of investing in new interconnection capacity through the application of a TIMES model of Europe considering 18 regions. The modeling approach considers a temporal resolution able to account for the electricity supply and demand dynamics, which exist within and across the different regions. Four different scenarios of increasing interconnection capacities were considered. The results show that high interconnection capacities enable the European countries to better utilize their potential for onshore wind energy, which is cheaper than wind offshore and solar energy. Reductions of up to 10% on the investment in new generation capacity, fixed costs and operation costs, can be achieved, when compared to a business as usual scenario. Â© 2015 IEEE.

TI  - Numerical simulation of wave energy converter with hydrofoil blades under various wave conditions
AB  - Ocean wave is a rich source of renewable energy with much higher power density than winds. Various WEC technologies have been proposed or are under development. In this study, we developed a 2-dimensional (2D) model and analyzed the rotational motion of the lift-type rotor's blade under steady flow and unsteady flow. The numerical model was validated by experiments under steady flow. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis was performed to identify the major contribution of frequency in terms of vortexes generated in the flow field. A comparative study was also performed by comparing all the cases in terms of energy conversion efficiency under different wave conditions. It turns out that the efficiency of energy conversion has a maximum value in the steady flow, while the efficiency for unsteady flow keeps decreasing, therefore this is highly due to the increased dissipation because of the oscillating. When the flow is oscillating, the rotational speed of the rotor under periodic condition is lower than the rotational velocity with steady flow, and a curve fitting was performed in this study to predict the periodic average rotational speed. We conclude that for oscillating flow a minimum of 1.6% energy conversion efficiency can be expected, but it may vary for the actual ocean waves. It is expected the current 2D simulation results can contribute to the wave energy community, especially when the rotor design and optimization is required. Copyright Â© 2019 ASME

TI  - Pile driving noise induces transient gait disruptions in the longfin squid (Doryteuthis pealeii)
AB  - Anthropogenic noise is now a prominent pollutant increasing in both terrestrial and marine environments. In the ocean, proliferating offshore windfarms, a key renewable energy source, are a prominent noise concern, as their pile driving construction is among the most intense anthropogenic sound sources. Yet, across taxa, there is little information of pile driving noise impacts on organismal fine-scale movement despite its key link to individual fitness. Here, we experimentally quantified the swimming behavior of an abundant squid species (Doryteuthis pealeii) of vital commercial and ecological importance in response to in situ pile driving activity on multiple temporal and spatial scales (thus exposed to differing received levels, or noise-doses). Pile driving induced energetically costly alarm-jetting behaviors in most (69\%) individuals at received sound levels (in zero to peak) of 112-123 dB re 1 mu m s(-2), levels similar to those measured at the kilometer scale from some wind farm construction areas. No responses were found at a comparison site with lower received sound levels. Persistence of swimming pattern changes during noise-induced alarm responses, a key metric addressing energetic effects, lasted up to 14 s and were significantly shorter in duration than similar movement changes caused by natural conspecific interactions. Despite observing dramatic behavioral changes in response to initial pile driving noise, there was no evidence of gait changes over an experiment day. These results demonstrate that pile driving disrupts squid fine-scale movements, but impacts are short-lived suggesting that offshore windfarm construction may minimally impact the energetics of this ecologically key taxon. However, further work is needed to assess potential behavioral and physiological impacts at higher noise levels.

TI  - Wave Energy Resource Analysis for Use in Wave Energy Conversion
AB  - In order to correctly predict and evaluate the response of wave energy converters (WECs), an accurate representation of wave climate resource is crucial. This paper gives an overview of wave resource modeling techniques and applies a methodology to estimate the naturally available and technically recoverable resource in a given deployment site. The methodology was initially developed by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), which uses a modified Gamma spectrum to interpret sea state hindcast parameter data produced by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations (NOAA's) Wave-watch III. This Gamma spectrum is dependent on the calibration of two variables relating to the spectral width parameter and spectral peakedness parameter. In this study, this methodology was revised by the authors to increase its accuracy in formulating wave length. The revised methodology shows how to assess a given geographic area's wave resource based on its wave power density and total annual wave energy flux.

TI  - Offshore wind farm layout optimization regarding wake effects and electrical losses
AB  - A major development of the offshore wind energy market is being witnessed. Since the implicated costs are considerably high, it is extremely important to ensure that the energy production is maximum, so that the costs per energy unit are minimized. Thus, the turbines should be strategically positioned to extract as much energy as possible from the wind, considering wake effect losses, as well as internal grid electrical losses. In order to avoid turbines to be placed in unrealistic positions, they should be distributed according to a grid of rectangular shaped cells; each of these is divided in multiple sub-cells. The problem of finding the turbines optimal position among the pre-defined sub-cells so that maximum annual energy is produced could be addressed using a deterministic approach. However, the problem becomes unfeasible when the number of turbines and/or the number of sub-cells increase. To overcome this difficulty, optimization techniques should be used. Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization are approached in this paper. This paper deals with the wind park layout optimization problem. A methodology to position the turbines inside a wind park so that the annual energy production is maximum is proposed. The results proved that the meta-heuristic method is much more CPU time efficient in providing the maximum annual year production as compared to the traditional deterministic approach.

TI  - Deployment characterization of a floatable tidal energy converter on a tidal channel, Ria Formosa, Portugal
AB  - This paper presents the results of a pilot experiment with an existing tidal energy converter (TEC), Evopod 1 kW floatable prototype, in a real test case scenario (Faro Channel, Ria Formosa, Portugal). A baseline marine geophysical, hydrodynamic and ecological study based on the experience collected on the test site is presented. The collected data was used to validate a hydro-morphodynamic model, allowing the selection of the installation area based on both operational and environmental constraints. Operational results related to the description of power generation capacity, energy capture area and proportion of energy flux are presented and discussed, including the failures occurring during the experimental setup. The data is now available to the scientific community and to TEC industry developers, enhancing the operational knowledge of TEC technology concerning efficiency, environmental effects, and interactions (i.e. device/environment). The results can be used by developers on the licensing process, on overcoming the commercial deployment barriers, on offering extra assurance and confidence to investors, who traditionally have seen environmental concerns as a barrier, and on providing the foundations whereupon similar deployment areas can be considered around the world for marine tidal energy extraction.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Prediction of Wind Power for Multi-turbines in a Wind Farm
AB  - The prediction of wind power plays an indispensable role in maintaining the stability of the entire power grid. In this paper, a deep learning approach is proposed for the power prediction of multiple wind turbines. Starting from the time series of wind power, it is present a two-stage modeling strategy, in which a deep neural network combines spatiotemporal correlation to simultaneously predict the power of multiple wind turbines. Specifically, the network is a joint model composed of Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Herein, the LSTM captures the temporal dependence of the historical power sequence, while the CNN extracts the spatial features among the data, thereby achieving the power prediction for multiple wind turbines. The proposed approach is validated by using the wind power data from an offshore wind farm in China, and the results in comparison with other approaches shows the high prediction preciseness achieved by the proposed approach.

TI  - An empirical model as a supporting tool to optimize the main design parameters of a stationary oscillating water column wave energy converter
AB  - An empirical model, to be used as a tool to aid in the definition of the optimal values of the main design parameters of oscillating water column wave energy converter devices, is proposed. An extensive dataset of capture width ratio of the device, obtained from both experimental tests and Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations, is used to formulate the model. The model has been developed by applying the dimensional analysis to select the non-dimensional independent variables of the functional form. A multiple non-linear regression method is used to compute the model power coefficients and empirical constants. The model can predict the capture width ratio of the oscillating water column device given the wave conditions, the water depth, the geometrical parameters of the device and the turbine damping as input variables. It can be used in the preliminary stage of the device design, allowing to comparatively test a considerable number of design alternatives with reduced computational efforts. Though based on regression analysis, the model implicitly includes all the non-linear effects observed experimentally and numerically. The relevance of the proposed model is demonstrated by an example application to a selected installation site in the Mediterranean Sea. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Retiring environmental risks of marine renewable energy devices: The â€œhabitat changeâ€ case
AB  - The installation, presence, operation, and decommissioning of marine renewable energy (MRE) devices inevitably alters the surrounding ocean habitats. These changes may include direct effects on the benthos from the installation or removal of foundations and anchors, changes in community composition on and near devices, artificial reef effects, and indirect effects such as alteration of the food web or facilitation of non-native, invasive species dispersal. Although there is no expectation that MRE devices affect marine environments differently than other anthropogenic ocean uses, regulators and stakeholders continue to have questions about potential negative impacts to species and habitats from development. The objective here was to lay a path to advance toward risk retirement for potential habitat changes caused by MRE devices. Research studies and survey reports that inform our understanding of habitat changes were compiled into an evidence base, sorted into categories of effects, and evaluated by a group of international experts to assess potential risk to habitats and biota from small numbers of MRE devices, as well as to identify knowledge gaps. These gaps were organized by category and divided up by relevance to consenting, research, or project development and monitoring responsibilities. Identifying these â€œknown unknownsâ€ allows for study design and collaboration from various perspectives to fill the knowledge gaps. Distribution of the evidence base and remaining uncertainties and knowledge gaps to the MRE community, coupled with new research, will help advance the MRE industry while resolving concerns about the potential risks of habitat change for small numbers of devices.

TI  - Coping with the obstacles in harvesting the energy of sea waves
AB  - This paper discusses the major obstacles in harvesting the energy of sea waves. These natural phenomena offer a huge source of pollution-free energy. The energy from this source might be capable of replacing all the energy presently supplied by the existing fossil burning plants. This means, that the harvest from this source of energy is capable of drastically reducing the amount of polluting gases which are presently being emitted into the atmosphere. In addition to the above, this source does not pose such colossal potential dangers to humans, as the use of nuclear energy. Nor does it cause the often so unpleasant noise pollution generated by wind farms. However, to the best of the author's knowledge, this source of energy still remains unexploited. This paper discusses five of the major obstacles which, till now, have prevented this objective from becoming a reality. These are: a. The random nature of the variations in the occurrence and the intensity of the sea waves, makes the supply of energy from that source very irregular and unreliable. b. The corrosive activity of the sea water and of secretions from certain forms of sea life, creates a need of frequent replacements of the wetted parts, respectively the need to make them of exotic and often very expensive materials. c. The blocking, clogging and jamming of the equipment by seaweeds and other matter which is being carried by the waves, may cause frequent interruptions in the operations of the power plant and extra expenses on cleaning the affected parts of the equipment. d. The destructive nature of the sea waves, like the abrasion of parts by particles of sand which are carried by the waves, or the impact of floating logs of fallen trees etc. may require frequent shutdowns of the plant and costly repairs. e. The economic aspects of such a power plant. The cost of constructing and of running such a plant has to be adequately low. To allow an affordable supply of power. This paper present the outline of a design, which is capable of reducing the severity of all the obstacles listed above, to tolerable limits. Copyright Â© 2008 by ASME.

TI  - Interference Model for an Array of Wave-Energy-Absorbing Flexible Structures
AB  - Considerable work has been undertaken for the improvement of wave-energy converters and array design. It has recently been suggested that by extracting wave energy, these farms could also serve to protect shorelines from wave damage. The present work focuses on the local effects of wave-structure interactions within an array of oscillating absorbers to optimize global effects, such as reflection, damping, and energy absorption. We use a model system of flexible blades, subjected to monochromatic waves, and develop a simplified one-dimensional model to predict optimal configurations, depending on various parameters, which include the number of blades, their spacing, and their flexibility. Optimal configurations are found to be close to regular patterns, and the impact of array configurations is shown to be limited regarding wave dissipation, mainly due to a competition between reflection and absorption.

TI  - Bridge pier geometry effects on local scour potential: A comparative study
AB  - Scour, or the localized loss of soil around the foundation, is a dominant factor contributing to failure. Scour at bridge piers, columns of elevated buildings, and wind turbines with monopile foundations can cause damage after flooding and natural hazards. However, due to the lack of sophisticated modeling, scour is not fully understood. This study utilizes computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations to understand the performance of different flow countermeasures in reducing the scour potential. We look at altering the flow around the pier and thereby alleviating the horseshoe vortices and downflow issues. CFD models are developed and validated with available experimental data. The recommended models, with turbulence closures, are employed to predict the bed shear stress for different pier configurations: streamlined shape, tapered sheath, delta vane, and guide wall with slanting vanes. Reductions in the maximum bed shear stress are 30\% for both the angled plate and the delta vane, 20\% for the tapered sheath, and 15\% for the guide wall with slanting vanes. By reducing the bed shear stress, these countermeasures demonstrate their capability to mitigate scour. The proposed solutions have a potential to minimize the accelerated deterioration and protect bridges, elevated buildings, wind turbines, and coastal and offshore infrastructure against scour-induced failures.

TI  - Wave energy potential assessment in the central and southern regions of the South China Sea
AB  - Wave energy potential in the South China Sea was assesed and analysed based on a 31-year simulation of wave characteristics using the third generation spectral WAVEWATCH III (TM) model. The model was forced by Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) winds and ETOPO2 bathymetry data. The highest annual wave power can be found in the northern region of the study area with amplitudes exceeding 20 kW/m. The values decrease gradually towards the Sunda Shelf and reach to their minimum at coastal regions due to bathymetry complekity, shadowing and island obstruction effects. However, the wave power is strongly influenced by seasonality and inter-annual fluctuation. Nine sites representing different sub-regions were selected for further analysis on eligibility of wave farming. Various wave energy statistics including estimated electric power for a number of Wave Energy Converter (WEC) devices showed some stations (Hameau Mo in Vietnamese east coast, Spratly Island, Palawan and Cape Bolinao in west coast of Luzon) have greater eligibility for wave power farming. The estimated electric power that can be produced from these sites using Wave Dragon, an intermediate depth WEC device, ranges from 712 to 1211 kW and 935-1680 kW for annual and a six-month period from September to February, respectively.

TI  - Conflicts between Fisheries and Offshore Wind Power in Taiwan: Legal and Administrative Prospects
AB  - Offshore wind power (OWP) has become a new emerging favorable renewable energy in Taiwan. Despite the fact that its development in Taiwan seems promising in the near future, it is facing some unwanted challenges recently, particularly the protests from fishers. The purpose of this paper is to understand jurisdiction over offshore areas in Taiwan via analyzing conflicts between OWP developers and fishers in Taiwan and finds that existing jurisdiction over the offshore areas in Taiwan seems to be not supportive to the development OWP. Jurisdiction among different acts is not consistent, and it is not administered by a specific agency. Most importantly, the Fisheries Act allows some specific people or groups to enjoy fishing rights as their property in rem in Taiwan's offshore areas. To this end, the revision of the current Fisheries Act to set such rights as a privilege should be a must, but the government will need to pay a vast amount of money for doing so. Further, if a ``one-shop{''} mechanism such as the Ocean Affairs Council would be adopted, the development of OWP and the addressing of disputes among different users, particularly with fishers, fishers' associations, and cooperatives, would be more effective and promising.

TI  - 3-D shear-layer model for the simulation of multiple wind turbine wakes: description and first assessment
AB  - The number of turbines installed in offshore wind farms has strongly increased in the last years and at the same time the need for more precise estimations of the wind farm efficiency too. In this sense, the interaction between wakes has become a relevant aspect for the definition of a wind farm layout, for the assessment of its annual energy yield and for the evaluation of wind turbine fatigue loads. For this reason, accurate models for multiple overlapping wakes are a main concern of the wind energy community. Existing engineering models can only simulate single wakes, which are superimposed when they are interacting in a wind farm. This method is a practical solution, but it is not fully supported by a physical background. The limitation to single wakes is given by the assumption that the wake is axisymmetric. As an alternative, we propose a new shear-layer model that is based on the existing engineering wake models but is extended to also simulate non-axisymmetric wakes. In this paper, we present the theoretical background of the model and four application cases. We evaluate the new model for the simulation of single and multiple wakes using large-eddy simulations as reference. In particular, we report the improvements of the new model predictions in comparison to a sum-of-squares superposition approach for the simulation of three interacting wakes. The lower deviation from the reference considering single and multiple wakes encourages the further development of the model and promises a successful application for the simulation of wind farm flows.

TI  - Impact of different weather years on the design of hydrogen supply pathways for transport needs
AB  - Renewable energy sources (RES) will play a crucial role in future sustainable energy systems. In scenarios analyzing future energy system designs, a detailed spatial and temporal representation of renewable-based electricity generation is essential. For this, sufficiently representative weather data are required. Most analyses performed in this context use the historical data of either one specific reference year or an aggregation of multiple years. In contrast, this study analyzes the impact of different weather years based on historical weather data from 1980 through 2016 in accordance with the design of an exemplary future energy system. This exemplary energy system consists of on- and offshore wind energy for power-to-hydrogen via electrolysis, including hydrogen pipeline transport for most southwestern European countries. The assumed hydrogen demand for transportation needs represents a hypothetical future market penetration for fuel cell-electric vehicles of 75\%. An optimization framework is used in order to evaluate the resulting system design with the objective function of minimizing the total annual cost (TAC) of the system. For each historical weather year, the applied optimization model determines the required capacities and operation of wind power plants, electrolyzers, storage technologies and hydrogen pipelines to meet the assumed future hydrogen demand in a highly spatially-and temporally-detailed manner, as well as the TAC of the system. Following that, the results of every individual year are compared in terms of installed capacities, overall electricity generation and connection to the transmission network, as well as the cost of these components within each region. The results reveal how sensitive the final design of the exemplary system is to the choice of the weather year. For example, the TAC of the system changes by up to 20\% across two consecutive weather years. Furthermore, significant variation in the optimization results regarding installed capacities per region with respect to the choice of weather years can be observed.

TI  - Investigation of the potential of wind-waves as a renewable energy resource: by the example of Cesme-Turkey
AB  - There are opinions claiming that 70\% of the world energy consumption could be provided from renewable resources by the year 2050. These resources are needed, because fossil fuels both cause pollution of the environment and will be depleted in the near future. In this regard, the objective of this study was to determine the wave energy potential and the costs associated with its application to Turkish waters. To this goal, the wave energy potential in Cesme-lzmir was investigated. Cesme is known to have abundant wind, which plays the primary role in the formation of sea waves. For this purpose, the Solar Energy Institute of Ege University carried out wind velocity measurements within the period from 05.11.1998 to 05.11.1999 at an altitude of 10 m in Cesme. The measured values were regarded as if they were taken at an altitude of 19.5 m from seawater level. With this approach, the Pierson-Moskowitz wave energy spectrum was constructed. Through this wave energy spectrum, wave energy that is to be obtained at the measurement area within one year was determined. The variation of wave energy according to each month was evaluated. Hence, the unit cost of electricity to be produced by a turbine (with a width of 1 m), assumed to be installed at the area of measurements, was calculated. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It's generally very difficult to consider both balances and to judge which is important. Inclusive Impact Index (III), proposed by Marine Environmental Committee in JASNAOE, includes environment factor which is obtained by the method of Ecological Footprint (EF) and economical factor which is converted to global hectare. We can objectively discuss the social importance of the development by using this index.

TI  - Type-2 neutrosophic number based multi-attributive border approximation area comparison (MABAC) approach for offshore wind farm site selection in USA
AB  - The technical, logistical, and ecological challenges associated with offshore wind development necessitate an extensive site selection analysis. Technical parameters such as wind resource, logistical concerns such as distance to shore, and ecological considerations such as fisheries all must be evaluated and weighted, in many cases with incomplete or uncertain data. Making such a critical decision with severe potential economic and ecologic consequences requires a strong decision-making approach to ultimately guide the site selection process. This paper proposes a type-2 neutrosophic number (T2NN) fuzzy based multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model for offshore wind farm (OWF) site selection. This approach combines the advantages of neutrosophic numbers sets, which can utilize uncertain and incomplete information, with a multi-attributive border approximation area comparison that provides formulation flexibility and easy calculation. Further, this study develops and integrates a techno-economic model for OWFs in the decision-making. A case study is performed to evaluate and rank five proposed OWF sites off the coast of New Jersey. To validate the proposed model, a comparison against three alternative T2NN fuzzy based models is performed. It is demonstrated that the implemented model yields the same ranking order as the alternative approaches. Sensitivity analysis reveals that changing criteria weightings does not affect the ranking order.

TI  - Potential impacts of hydrokinetic and wave energy conversion technologies on aquatic environments
AB  - A new generation of hydropower technologies, the kinetic hydro and wave energy conversion devices, offers the possibility of generating electricity from the movements of water, without the need for dams and diversions. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 encouraged the development of these sources of renewable energy in the United States, and there is growing interest in deploying them globally. The technologies that would extract electricity from free-flowing streams, estuaries, and oceans have not been widely tested. Consequently, the U.S. Department of Energy convened a workshop to (1) identify the varieties of hydrokinetic energy and wave energy conversion devices and their stages of development, (2) identify where these technologies can best operate, (3) identify the potential environmental issues associated with these technologies and possible mitigation measures, and (4) develop a list of research needs and/or practical solutions to address unresolved environmental issues. We review the results of that workshop, focusing on potential effects on freshwater, estuarine, and marine ecosystems, and we describe recent national and international developments.

TI  - Evaluation of the wave energy resources in the Cape Verde Islands
AB  - The Cape Verde Islands form an archipelago off the African coast in the Atlantic Ocean. Since it is highly dependent on fossil fuels, Cape Verde decision makers have started to take into account also the potential of renewable energies, especially wind and solar. In particular, wind power has already 26 MW' installed. From this perspective, the present work aims to be a first step in the evaluation of a different source of renewable energy, the wave energy. Using reanalysis data from ECMWF, the SWAN model was run for a 10-year period, covering the time interval 2004-2013, using a methodology already implemented in other island environments. Moreover, three years of this high resolution data are compared with the available altimetry data. In this way, a dataset of the sea state conditions around Cape Verde Islands was produced. This dataset is further used for wave climate analyses and wave energy resource assessments. This study indicates that the coastal environment of the Cape Verde Islands, and especially some particular areas, present considerable wave energy resources that should be taken in consideration for extraction in the near future.

TI  - Construction of non-grid-connected wind power industrial bases in Jiangsu coastal areas
AB  - With the increasing energy prices and discharge of greenhouse gas, the current energy consumption calls for large-scale application of renewable energies. Among all new types of energy, the development of wind power is so fast, only second to water energy. Jiangsu lies in an area where wind energy is abundant, especially in the Jiangsu coastal areas, which provides a large space for wind power development. Application of large scale non-grid-connected wind power is one of the methods to multi-directional developing wind power. According to non-grid-connected wind power theory, non-grid-connected wind power can be applied to a series of high energy consumption industries. In this paper, the authors study the industrial chain of "applying non-gridconnected wind power to high energy consumption industries" under the instruction of non-grid-connected wind power theory, and put forward some suggestions for constructing industrial bases in Jiangsu coastal areas.

TI  - Novel Configuration and Transient Management Control Strategy for VSC-HVDC
AB  - This paper presents a novel system configuration for voltage source converter (VSC)-based high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission connected to a large-scale offshore wind power plant (WPP). The proposed scheme is reconfigured at the onshore end to achieve shunt and series compensation, which is named as `Unified-VSC-HVDC' (U-VSC-HVDC). A mathematical model of the proposed configuration is derived to determine the rating of the employed series and shunt converters. To achieve a flexible control strategy for balanced and unbalanced fault conditions, the proposed transient management scheme employs positive and negative sequence controllers for the series compensation. The negative sequence voltage components are determined in such a way as to minimize power oscillations caused by asymmetrical faults, and hence to reduce DC link voltage overshoots. A test system comprised of a detailed representation of the proposed configuration is simulated and evaluated using PSCAD/EMTDC. A comprehensive study validates the capability of the proposed configuration and transient management scheme for achieving smooth power transfer and superior transient performance of the electrical grid. Also, it minimizes the possibilities of electrical network propagations in response to symmetrical and asymmetrical grid faults.

AB  - The master of Renewable Energy in the Marine Environment (REM) is an Erasmus Mundus program funded by the European Union that has had its first intake during the 2018-2019 course. Erasmus Mundus Masters are organized by a set of partner institutions -typically universities- from different countries of the European Union. The REM leader is the University of the Basque Country in Spain. Students come from all over the world and are selected under very competitive and strict conditions based on their previous academic performance. Once they have been selected they can follow two academic tracks and spend one semester at each of the countries corresponding to the different partners of the consortium: Spain, UK (Scotland), Norway and France. The focus of this master is the oceans, but considered as a source of renewable energy. Recently, the Commission's Blue Growth Strategy identified the ocean energy sector as one of the emerging areas in the blue economy. Offshore wind and waves-along with other renewables- will play an important role at helping the European Union (EU) meet its environmental goal This requires highly qualified staff for the companies and institutions inspiring and driving the transition to a climate-friendly economy. In this context, a master like REM plays an important role at providing high-level academic contents while closely interacting with the private sector in different cutting-edge technological challenges. In this work, an educational experience corresponding to one subject in the REM Erasmus Mundus Master is shown. This subject is called Ocean wave energy and offshore wind energy assessment, has 4.5 ECTS (45h in the classroom), belongs to the first module of REM called Resource and marine environment and is connected with a follow-up subject in Nantes (France). It deals with ocean waves and offshore wind which are analyzed as geophysical fluids holding an energetic potential. The focus of the subject is practical, under the Project Based Learning approach. The four teachers of the subject belong to the EOLO research group www.ehu.es/eolo with a lengthy experience in offshore wind and waves studies. In the classroom, after a short theoretical introduction, real-world exercises connected to the scientific activities of EOLO, are proposed to students which must be solved using different types of open-source software like Octave and R. The educational experience in this first edition, encourages us to follow this path in next editions since all the educational objectives have been met. Students have reached to understand a scientific description of reanalyses, wind and ocean waves and evaluate the energetic potential of ocean waves and offshore wind. The conclusion is that the practical focus of the subject based on real-world, hands-on exercises proposed in the classroom, has proven to be highly successful for students coming from all over the world and with many different backgrounds.

TI  - A New Stand-Alone Hybrid Power System with Wind Turbine Generator and Photovoltaic Modules for a Small-Scale Radio Base Station
AB  - This paper proposes a new stand-alone hybrid power system with a wind turbine generator and photovoltaic modules for a small-scale radio base station. We studied the system characteristics by simulation of operation on Yonaguni Island, where wind speed exceeds 4.0 m/s throughout the year, and average annual wind speed is about 7.0 m/s. The results of simulation show that, to attain a system operation rate of 100%, the base station equipment requires a wind turbine generator output power of 8 kW, a photovoltaic output power of 7.6 kW, and 3-day backup storage batteries.

TI  - The energy capture efficiency increased by choosing the optimal layout of turbines in tidal power farm
AB  - In recent years, with the development of global economy, many environmental issues, such as energy shortage and global warming are becoming more and more serious all over the world, and more attention was paid on the better use of marine renewable energy. Among all the variety of marine renewable energy, tidal power generation technology is relatively mature. In order to gain more tidal energy for the purpose of commercial application, one of the best ways is to make turbine arrays in tidal power farm. Because of the wake effects on tidal steam turbines in tidal power farm, the performance of the flow field around the turbines was changed and has impact on the capture efficiency of electric power. Therefore, study on the interaction effects on tidal stream turbines and the optimization of the layout of the tidal stream turbine array becomes one of the key problems in the construction of tidal power farm, which directly influences the economic benefits of tidal power farm. There are many parameters that have impact on turbines in tidal farms, such as the distance between turbines, the longitudinal and lateral layout, the rotation direction of rotors, and so on. In this paper, different approaches (such as numerical calculating and simulation, model test, etc.) to study on the optimizing the layout of the horizontal axis tidal steam turbines in tidal power farm were introduced. These research works will provide theoretical basis for the construction of tidal power farms in the future. Optimized layout of turbines in tidal power farm can increase the capture efficiency of tidal turbines, and it has great sense to relieve energy shortage and global warming problem by obtaining more marine renewable energy.

TI  - Upper-bound analysis of laterally loaded rigid monopiles in clay with linearly increasing strength
AB  - Monopiles supporting offshore wind farms are often subject to severe lateral environmental loads due to wind, waves, and currents. Previous studies have reported various failure patterns for such rigid monopiles in clay; hence predicting lateral pile capacity of widely different magnitudes. In this study, both a single-sided wedge failure mechanism involving passive soil failure only and a two-sided wedge failure mechanism with simultaneous active and passive soil failures are proposed. The single wedge mechanism is found to be applicable if the soil behind the pile does not move together with the pile, resulting in a gap between the soil and the pile upon loading. In contrast, the two-sided wedge is found appropriate for the soil behind the pile that moves together with the pile upon loading. Two formulations are then derived from the two upper-bound failure mechanisms. The lateral pile capacity can be determined and the corresponding failure mechanism identified based on the formulation that yields the lower capacity magnitude. In addition, the reliability of the formulations is verified against reported finite element methods as well as existing experimental and field test results. Â© Canadian Science Publishing.

TI  - Experimental study of the shear flow effect on tidal turbine blade loading variation
AB  - Tidal turbine arrays are planed to be installed in areas with strong currents where the flow can often be sheared throughout the water column. To study the shear flow effects on tidal turbine, four vertical velocity profiles are generated in a flume tank and are imposed to a three-bladed horizontal axis turbine model. Results show that the sheared velocity profiles do not impact the turbine average performance but are responsible for an increase of blade root streamwise load variations. Blade root streamwise load is moreover linked to the turbine rotational frequency and its harmonics. The velocity perceived by the blades during their rotation is estimated over the rotor area and is compared to the angular phase average of the streamwise load measured on the blades. The phase average of the load and the velocity perceived by the blades are highly correlated even if a varying phase lag has been noticed between these two quantities. This phase lag is dependent on the rotational speed of the turbine, on the incoming flow shear, and is probably caused by the turbine induction effects. This experimental study is a first step to understand the effect of shear velocity profiles on tidal turbines better. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - The simulation of oscillating wave surge converters using a Boussinesq model; Wave disturbances around an array
AB  - A new method for simulating a frequency independent absorption within DHI's Mike 21 Boussinesq wave (BW) model is presented. This provides an increase in the accuracy of the simulation of wave processes around a hypothetical WEC array. Multiple monochromatic wave simulations are combined to represent a wave spectrum. Wave device characteristics are then simulated using porosity layers. A frequency dependent porosity for each device is then applied based on data taken from an experimental study. This method is tested for nearshore shallow water devices where the wave energy disturbance is quantified for flat and varying domain gradients.

TI  - Regime-based supervisory control to reduce power fluctuations from offshore wind power plants
AB  - Wind power fluctuations, especially offshore, can pose challenges in the secure and stable operation of the power system. In modern large offshore wind farms, there are supervisory controls designed to reduce the power fluctuations. Their operation is limited due to the fact that they imply loss of production, hence revenue for the wind farm operator. On the other hand, progresses in short term forecasting, together with the increasing use of probabilistic forecasting can help in achieving efficient power fluctuations reduction with minimum lost production. Here we present supervisory control concepts that consider different wind power regimes to derive control setpoints by using a Markov-Switching AutoRegressive model. We evaluate the performance versus measured data in terms of power ramp characteristics and energy efficiency. Â© 2013 IEEE.

TI  - Full-scale prototype of an overtopping breakwater for wave energy conversion
AB  - The Overtopping BReakwater for Energy Conversion (OBREC) is a new typology of overtopping wave energy converter (OTD) integrated into a traditional rubble mound breakwater. The device can be considered as an innovative non-conventional breakwater that has the same functions as the traditional structures with the addedvalued of the energy production. The paper presents a comprehensive overview of the OBREC, offering a synthesis of the complete design process, from the results of the two complementary test campaigns in small scale carried out in 2012 and 2014 at Aalborg University, to the description of the full-scale device installed in Naples in 2016. The device represents the first OTD device in full-scale integrated into an existing rubble mound breakwater and it has been equipped by an instrumental apparatus to measure its response to the wave interaction. The monitoring of the full-scale device in the port of Naples, particularly during storm conditions, is aimed to study the scaling effects in wave loading and the overall performance of this breakwater-integrated OTD, included performance in terms of the energy production.

TI  - Offshore wind: The next steps (Abstract only)
AB  - Summary form only given. The UK is now a world leader in offshore wind generation, with 584 MW of operational capacity installed offshore. The next 12 years will see a significant increase in this capacity, with further Round 1 and 2 wind farms becoming operational, and the advent of Round 3. This scale of activity will bring both great challenges but also great opportunities for a still young, but fast maturing industry. This session will examine the contribution offshore wind can make to the EU targets, progress so far and the engineering and technological demands of the escalation in offshore wind deployment required to meet these targets.

AB  - A 10-year hindcast system was developed to characterize the wave conditions and to assess the wave energy potential in the western coast of France. WAVEWATCH III is used to generate waves for the entire North Atlantic basin and a transformation model, SWAN, is used to study the evolution of the waves in the French coast, as a result of wind forcing. In a previous study the hindcast system was validated with buoy measurements, good agreement was observed between the measurements and the calculated parameters, therefore in the present study an evaluation of the variability of wave energy resource in the coast of France and in particular in the pilot area of Le Croisic was performed.

TI  - Flexible operation optimisation of tidal lagoons
AB  - This paper focuses on facilitating the development of Tidal Range Structures (TRSs), including tidal lagoons by using an improved Genetic Algorithm (GA) model to optimise the operation schemes over a Spring-Neap tidal cycle. The GA model splits the operation into a single tidal cycle to optimise the operation of TRSs through the process of mutation, recombination and selection, which creates the new schemes. The combined operation of two prospective tidal lagoon projects: West Somerset Lagoon (WSL) and North Wales Tidal Lagoon (NWTL) are used as case studies to demonstrate the potential of the flexible operation optimisation of TRSs for multiple objectives. For one of the scenarios, the operation of two schemes could be optimised so that both schemes generate electricity over 95% of the simulation period.

AB  - A technique has been developed for imaging the wind field over offshore areas being considered for wind farming. This is accomplished with an eye-safe 2-Î¼m wavelength coherent Doppler lidar installed in an aircraft. By raster scanning the aircraft over the wind energy area (WEA), a three-dimensional map of the wind vector can be made. This technique was evaluated in 11 flights over the Virginia and Maryland offshore WEAs. Heights above the ocean surface planned for wind turbines are shown to be within the marine boundary layer, and the wind vector is seen to show variation across the geographical area of interest at turbine heights.

AB  - As an equatorial country, Indonesian archipelago is suitable for SPS receiving site. This paper describes rectenna development aspects in Indonesia to get a picture that can be used in determining policy in the field of electrical energy supply in the future. It is recommended that to maximize the land utilization, the rectenna structure must be made at least 60\% translucent. It could be built in the area of barren, or desert land that is widely available in Eastern Indonesia. Rectenna should be built with the concept of greening, in which the presence of electrical energy can be greened barren areas. Another alternative for rectenna site is in uninhabited coral islands, which are widely scattered throughout the Indonesian archipelago.

TI  - Modification of tidal resonance in the Severn Estuary by a barrage and lagoon
AB  - The Bristol Channel/Severn Estuary has some of the largest tides in the world with a mean spring tidal range of 12.2 m. Numerous proposals have been made to exploit this for energy extraction. However, the large tidal range is partially driven by tidal resonance and such systems can be sensitive to small changes. Thus, it is important to understand the impact of a barrage on the resonance of the system which in turn leads to an understanding of the environmental impact of building a barrage. In this paper, we examine the resonant response of the Bristol Channel system, with and without a barrage structure deployed, using a depth-averaged numerical model. We find that the barrage can alter the response of the Bristol Channel to excitation with higher frequencies than 12 h. However, the barrage causes very little change to the resonant response for longer periods including for the semi-diurnal periods which dominate the tides in the region. We also briefly examine the Swansea Lagoon scheme and find that this is too small to have a significant impact on the resonant response of the channel. Â© 2020, The Author(s).

TI  - Downscaling of future national capacity scenarios of the French electricity system to the regional level
AB  - In order to respond to the COP21 targets in terms of carbon mitigation, the participant governments have set pledges and roadmaps for renewable energy penetration in order to decarbonize the different energy sectors (electricity, transport, industry, etc.). This paper raises the question of the regional distribution of the targeted renewable capacities and their precise locations across twelve regions in France. To do so, land and ocean eligibility for renewable penetration is studied taking into account the different environmental, techno-economic, social and political criteria constraining the implementation of renewable generation facilities. Onshore and offshore wind as well as solar photovoltaics (open field) are investigated. The maximum integration capacities are then evaluated for each region in France, and total 306, 33, and 1,626 GW respectively. According to a review of French capacity scenarios from in the literature, these potentials are clearly far beyond the renewable capacities suggested for 2035. Therefore, the eligible spots for renewable integration are subjected to a multi-criteria analysis in order to select the most propitious spots in response to the suggested capacities.

TI  - A new protection system of linear generators used for converting oceanic wave energy into electricity
AB  - Almost all of the linear generator used for oceanic wave energy conversion need a protection system against the natural disaster. This paper presents a new protection system for those linear generators for safe operation installed in the ocean. The protection system involves a complete standalone unit, a transmitter, and a receiver unit with a controller. The standalone unit placed in the ocean transmits a set of signals to a receiver situated at a suitable place. A display board is connected to the receiver from which the condition of the oceanic wave can be monitored. Another part of this protection system is the decision making unit which is connected to a motor through a driver. The motor is connected to a pulley with a rope which is further connected to the linear generator to be protected by pulling it in downward direction. Thus, the linear generator can be placed at a safe distance so that it can avoid natural adversity which often causes damages. A prototype is designed and fabricated which is also tested in a water reservoir. The experimental results exhibit excellent features of the proposed protection system. Â© 2017 IEEE.

TI  - Willingness to pay for green electricity in Korea: A contingent valuation study
AB  - Green electricity is energy that is generated from renewable energy sources such as solar power, wind power, small-scale hydroelectric power, tidal power, and biomass power. These sources mostly do not produce pollutants and are considered environmentally friendly. However, considering the current state of technology, they are more costly. Government should take visible actions to compensate for the increased production costs. This paper attempts to apply a contingent valuation (CV) method to obtain at least a preliminary evaluation of the benefits that ensue from the introduction of the policy that raises the percentage of green electricity consumption from 0.2% of the total electricity supply to 7% by 2011. Overall, the CV survey was successful in eliciting the willingness to pay (WTP) for green electricity considering that the CV method operated within respondents' abilities to answer and the WTP estimates were statistically significant. The monthly mean WTP estimates from parametric and non-parametric methods were KRW 1681 (USD 1.8) and KRW 2072 (USD 2.2), respectively. The estimates of the annual benefits to relevant residents amounted to KRW 150.5 billion (USD 157.5 million) and KRW 185.6 billion (USD 194.2 million), respectively. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Assessment of long-term extreme response of a floating support structure using the environmental contour method
AB  - This paper analyses the extreme response of a semi-submersible floating support structure for a wind turbine installed in the northern North Sea. The environmental contour method is used to directly estimate the extreme sea states that are used thereafter to calculate the long-term extreme response of the semi-submersible. This study focuses on the 1D and 2D environmental contours model based on the inverse first-order reliability method (IFORM). The significant wave height and peak period are the two environmental random variables used to estimate the contour. The response amplitude opera-tor of the heave, surge, and pitch in head waves are estimated using the 3D panel method. A full long-term analysis is performed and compared with that estimated by adopting the 1D and 2D model. The results show a remarkable deviation between the full long-term analysis and the long-term obtained by the environmental contour method except in the heave response.

With the proposed coordination control of VSCs in the WT-PMSGs and VSCHVDC system, the dynamic stability of the whole offshore wind energy system can be maintained under large disturbances. Then the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) method is proposed for tuning controller parameters of VSCs to improve the dynamic performances of the whole energy system. Finally, case studies for transient stability analysis are carried out to validate the proposed coordinated control strategy and parameters tuning by PSO method. In the testing system, two offshore wind farms and one AC power grid are interconnected as the meshed structure via the 3-terminal VSC-HVDC transmission system.

TI  - Coupled Dynamic Analysis of Hybrid Offshore Wind Turbine and Wave Energy Converter
AB  - The combined offshore wind and wave energy on an integrated platform is an economical solution for the offshore energy industry as they share the infrastructure and ocean space. The study presents the dynamic analysis of the Submerged Tension-Leg Platform (STLP) combined with a heaving-type point absorber wave energy converter (WEC). The feasibility study of the hybrid concept is performed using the aero-servo-hydro-elastic simulation tool FAST. The study analyzes the responses of the combined system to understand the influence of the WECs on the STLP platform for various operating conditions of the wind turbine under regular and irregular waves. Positive synergy is observed between the platform and the WECs, and the study also focuses on the forces and moments developed at the interface of the tower and platform to understand the effect of wind energy on the turbine tower and the importance of motion amplitudes on the performance of the combined platform system. The mean and standard deviation for the translation and rotational motions of combined wind and wave energy converters are determined for different sea states under both regular and irregular waves to analyze the change in responses of the structure. The study observed a reduction in motion amplitudes of the hybrid floating system with the addition of the wave energy converters around the STLP floater to improve the energy efficiency of the hybrid system. The study helps in understanding the best possible arrangement of point absorber-type wave energy converters at the conceptual stage of the design process. Copyright Â© 2021 by ASME

The power electronic equipment based on grid-forming control has the ability of frequency dynamic regulation, reactive power voltage regulation, weak current network operation stability and island operation similar to the conventional synchronous generator, however, the problem of strong electromagnetic stress faced by power electronic equipment under grid-forming control will be the key factor restricting the wide application and promotion of grid-forming technology. In particular, the fault ride through problem of the wind turbine under the grid-forming control will face more severe challenges. This paper is based on a switched fault ride through strategy, that is, in case of power grid fault, it is quickly converted from grid-forming control under normal working conditions to the conventional current vector control, so as to facilitate fault current limiting and realize fast dynamic reactive power support. In this paper, a fault ride through optimization control strategy of grid-forming wind turbine is proposed. During the fault, the threshold setting of entering/ exiting the fault ride through control is optimized to form hysteresis control, so as to improve the switching misoperation of control strategy caused by the large fluctuation of grid voltage in the process of fault. Finally, simulation results show that the earlier switching back to the grid-forming control is not the more conducive to the stability of the system, and there is an optimal switching time. The results verify the proposed strategy can effectively improve the transient stability of power system with grid-forming mode of the wind turbine. Â© 2022

TI  - Wave Extraction and Attenuation Performance of An Edinburgh Duck Wave Energy Converter
AB  - Edinburgh Duck wave energy converter (ED WEC) has excellent energy extraction performance and shows a great potential to integrate with other marine structures. This paper aims to investigate its wave energy extraction performance as a WEC and wave attenuation performance as a protection method for shoreline or marine structures. The wave and ED WEC interactions in regular waves are modeled using the Star-CCM+ software and verified by comparisons with published experimental results. The motion response, energy conversion efficiency, and transmission coefficient of the ED WEC with different attack angles, rotation center, and incident wave heights are investigated. Results indicate that the ED WEC with an attack angle of 42 degrees and a rotation center of 0.55 m below the mean water line can achieve both good wave energy extraction and wave attenuation performances. The wave energy extraction and wave attenuation performance of the ED WEC decrease significantly with the increase of wave nonlinearity characterized by the wave steepness. This paper can guide the practical application of the ED WEC at the early stage of design.

TI  - CO2 reduction strategies for the Northern Netherlands
AB  - The concern about global warming initiated ambitious CO2 reduction goals in cities and regions in the Netherlands. This article describes a study of such a local initiative for the Northern Netherlands. The research aimed to develop CO2 reduction scenarios for 2035 with national and international politics, and regional goals and opportunities being integrated. The scenarios were calculated using a bottom-up model. Four scenarios were developed with a defined goal of a 50\% CO2 reduction on the starting year (2000). The four scenarios were developed along two axes: centralized versus decentralized energy supply systems, and international climate policy versus a European-oriented energy policy. Primary energy consumption varied between 273 and 443PJ. Although 50\% CO2 reduction is possible in all scenarios, an enormous effort would be required to reach this goal. Depending on the scenario: an almost 50\% reduction of the primary energy demand, the installation of 4 GW of offshore wind or the shift to a bio based economy is needed.

TI  - Variable speed control of series-connected DC wind turbines based on generalized dynamic model
AB  - DC wind farm with series-connected wind turbines is proved to be a promising solution to collect large-scale wind power, especially for offshore application. This paper proposes a novel variable speed control strategy of the DC wind turbine to reduce wind energy curtailment during the voltage limitation period. A generalized model is also presented to realize the DC wind turbine modelling with electromechanical transients and all control function. Based on PSCAD/EMTDC, dynamic simulation cases under varying wind conditions have been conducted with two seriesconnected wind turbines to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

TI  - Modeling a robust wind-speed forecasting to apply to wind-energy production
AB  - To obtain green energy, it is important to know, in advance, an estimation of the weather conditions. In case of wind energy, another important factor is to determine the right moment to stop the turbine in case of strong winds to avoid its damage. This research introduces a tool, not only to increase green energy generation from wind, reducing CO2 emissions, but also to prevent failures in turbines that is especially interesting for manufacturers. Using Artificial Neural Networks and data from meteorological stations located in Gran Canaria airport and Tenerife Sur airport (both in Canary Islands, Spain), a robust prediction system able to determine wind speed with a mean absolute error of 0.29 m per second is presented.

TI  - Control Strategy of Cascaded Multilevel Converter based on Dual Active Bridge for Wind Energy Conversion System
AB  - Low voltage high power wind energy conversion system (WECS) requires heavy cables and large step-up grid interfacing transformers. In recent years, power and voltage rating of offshore wind turbines have already reached 10MW and 10kV respectively, and medium voltage converters have become strongly demanded. Some scholars proposed a cascaded multilevel converter based on dual active bridge (DAB) to avoid the multi-phase generator, multi-windings transformer or large bridge inductors in traditional multilevel cascaded converter, which is suitable for medium voltage applications. However, there is little research on the strategies of current control, DC-Link voltage stability control and balance control for this topology. Thus, in this paper, the current side-split control and the voltage hierarchical control is proposed for the topology applied to medium voltage WECS. The control strategy is verified by simulation.

TI  - Dedicated large-scale floating offshore wind to hydrogen: Assessing design variables in proposed typologies
AB  - To achieve the Net-Zero Emissions goal by 2050, a major upscale in green hydrogen needs to be achieved; this will also facilitate use of renewable electricity as a source of decarbonised fuel in hard-to-abate sectors such as industry and transport. Nearly 80\% of the world's offshore wind resource is in waters deeper than 60 m, where bottom-fixed wind turbines are not feasible. This creates a significant opportunity to couple the high capacity factor floating offshore wind and green hydrogen.In this paper we consider dedicated large-scale floating offshore wind farms for hydrogen production with three coupling typologies; (i) centralised onshore electrolysis, (ii) decentralised offshore electrolysis, and (iii) centralised offshore electrolysis. The typology design is based on variables including for: electrolyser technology; floating wind platform; and energy transmission vector (electrical power or offshore hydrogen pipelines).Offshore hydrogen pipelines are assessed as economical for large and distant farms. The decentralised offshore typology, employing a semi-submersible platform could accommodate a proton exchange membrane electrolyser on deck; this would negate the need for an additional separate structure or hydrogen export compression and enhance dynamic operational ability. It is flexible; if one electrolyser (or turbine) fails, hydrogen production can easily continue on the other turbines. It also facilities flexibility in further expansion as it is very much a modular system.Alternatively, less complexity is associated with the centralised offshore typology, which may employ the electrolysis facility on a separate offshore platform and be associated with a farm of spar-buoy platforms in significant water depth locations.

TI  - The challenges of offshore wind farm installation in the 10km zone
AB  - Wind turbine technology has matured to allow large scale offshore wind farms to be feasible. The offshore wind farms to be installed before the year 2002 will be located in the near-shore region less than 10km from the coastline and in water depths less than 10 m. This paper considers the installation requirements for the present phase of offshore developments. With improvements in turbine technology, larger and consequently heavier generating nacelles have been developed. Larger and heavier nacelle units require taller supporting towers and larger foundations. This results in more onerous installation requirements. For the latest generation of wind turbines this paper examines the floating and jackup construction vessels required for the installation of the foundation, support tower and nacelle units. It discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these vessels when operating in shallow water. Budget estimates for typical installations are provided.

TI  - Physical and numerical analysis of a concept offshore wind farm service vessel hull design
AB  - Wind turbine maintenance and access during high sea states is a key issue for the successful operation of an offshore wind farm. Currently there is a 1.5m significant wave height (Hs) limit for the standard 'step over' method of transferring personnel to an offshore wind turbine. Increasing the Hs that offshore wind turbines can be accessed at would reduce the lifetime, levelised cost of energy and address a health and safety issue. The paper addresses this issue by examining a concept hull design for an offshore wind farm service vessel. The proposed design reduces the vessel's heave and motion by dampening its response to the wave motion. The design underwent both numerical and physical methods of testing. The numerical modelling was carried out in a 3-D wave basin built in ANSYS CFX and is based on symmetry across the hull which allows for three degrees of freedom. Physical modelling at 1:25 scale took place in the wave basin at Beaufort Research in University College Cork. A number of variations of the concept were tested and the results showed the aspects of the concept that could be beneficial to personnel transfer, through reduced response amplitude operators at zero forward speed.

TI  - Designing short term wave traces to assess wave power devices
AB  - In recent years modern numerical methods have been employed in the design of Wave Energy Converters (WECs), however the high computational costs associated with their use makes it prohibitive to undertake simulations involving statistically relevant numbers of wave cycles. Experimental tests in wave tanks could also be performed more efficiently and economically if short time traces, consisting of only a few wave cycles, could be used to evaluate the hydrodynamic characteristics of a particular device or design modification. Ideally, accurate estimations of device performance could be made utilizing results obtained from investigations with a relatively small number of wave cycles. However the difficulty here is that many WECs, such as the Oscillating Wave Surge Converter (OWSC), exhibit significant non-linearity in their response. Thus it is challenging to make accurate predictions of annual energy yield for a given spectral sea state using short duration realisations of that sea. This is because the non-linear device response to particular phase couplings of sinusoidal components within those time traces might influence the estimate of mean power capture obtained. As a result it is generally accepted that the most appropriate estimate of mean power capture for a sea state be obtained over many hundreds (or thousands) of wave cycles. This ensures that the potential influence of phase locking is negligible in comparison to the predictions made. In this paper, potential methods of providing reasonable estimates of relative variations in device performance using short duration sea states are introduced. The aim of the work is to establish the shortness of sea state required to provide statistically significant estimations of the mean power capture of a particular type of Wave Energy Converter. The results show that carefully selected wave traces can be used to reliably assess variations in power output due to changes in the hydrodynamic design or wave climate.

TI  - Nanomaterials in Protection of Buildings and Infrastructure Elements in Highly Aggressive Marine Environments
AB  - The 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) are both an engineering challenge and an opportunity. Clean energy (SDG 7), sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), and climate action (SDG 13) represent an effort to manage, plan, and develop our buildings and infrastructure. The purpose of this study is to contribute to this challenge by analysing nanomaterials in marine environment structures, both urban and maritime. To do this, we have analyzed different regulations of concrete properties in various countries, defining the characteristics of the cement, coating, water/cement rating, and chloride effect; the difference in durability based on conventional reinforcements and nanomaterials; and use on highly sensitive elements, buildings in marine environments, rubble mound structures, crown walls, and gravity-based foundations for wind power facilities. Division into overhead, underwater, or splash zones entails the use of epoxy resins or silica fume matrices in percentages far below ten percent. Using the most exposed and unfavorable structures, conclusions of application to buildings are established based on the recommendations in maritime engineering most exposed to the actions of the waves. The study concludes with recommendations regarding the durability, increased lifespan, and use of new materials in infrastructure elements in highly adverse marine environments.

TI  - Conceptual design and hydrodynamic performance of a modular hybrid floating foundation
AB  - The comprehensive utilization of offshore renewable energies is an effective way to solve the intermittency and variability of power supply. This paper aims to present a hybrid floating system (HFS) based on a modular buoyancy-distributed floating foundation (BDFF) that can be equipped with a horizontal-axis wind turbine, solar panels, and wave energy converters (WEC). A simplified test model with a Froude scale ratio of 1/10 is employed to perform the experiments in a deep-water basin to validate the numerical results computed from the code program ANSYS AQWA based on the potential flow theory. The Response Amplitude Operators (RAOs) under regular waves are compared to evaluate the hydrodynamic performance. There is a good agreement in the surge, pitch, and heave RAOs for experiments and the numerical simulation, with a maximum of 6.45 degrees per meter for the pitch motion. Furthermore, the mooring tensions in the time domain are analyzed under different wave conditions.The tension RAOs from simulations are slightly higher than those from measurements with a maximum value at the period of 3.416 s. The mooring line on the windward side has a more considerable mooring tension that is far less than the allowable tensile strength, especially under the wave height of 2 m and the wave period of 2.873 s. The influence of loaded weight representing solar panels is weak, and the impact of winds is acceptable, as the platform deviates 1.3 degrees from the equilibrium state under the test wind speed. Eventually, the effect of irregular waves on the HFS is presented with the critical parameters of mooring tension and pitch motion. The results show that the HFS has a good motion performance.

TI  - The importance of wave climate forecasting on the decision-making process for nearshore wave energy exploitation
AB  - This work presents a new methodology for the medium to long-term stochastic forecasting of the main variables and indexes related to the wave climate that are involved in the decision-making process to allocate, operate and maintain individual nearshore wave energy converters (WECs) and/or wave farms. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, this methodology includes the assessment of the uncertainty by means of Monte Carlo simulations, constituting a valuable step forward. The methodology is based on the simulation of Ny-year time series of wave climate variables that maintain the same statistical descriptors and seasonal and year-to-years variations of a hindcasted time series. This step is repeated Ne times to provide a sample size large enough to assess the uncertainty of the predictions. Because the wave energy resource is obtained from the nearshore, a large amount of wave propagations would be required. However, our methodology incorporates downscaling techniques that significantly improve the computational efficiency, and only a reduced number of Nw sea states should be propagated using an advanced numerical model. The methodology was applied to Playa Granada beach (southern Spain), obtaining the wave energy resource at 24 locations in the nearshore for 25-year time series repeated 1000 times. The selection of the most promising location for WECs on the basis of hindcasted or forecasted data provides different results. This highlights the importance of the proposed methodology for the advanced planning and design of any prospective energy extraction project. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Perceptions of offshore wind farms and community development: Case study of fangyuan township, chunghua county, Taiwan
AB  - Surrounded by the ocean, Taiwan has many rich marine cultural resources that have benefited its coastal communities and led to the development of diverse traditional marine industries. A typical example is the unique tradition of "Sea Buffalos Working in the Oyster Field", which has been practiced for over a century in Fangyuan Township of Changhua County. The cultural landscape of buffalos and workers cultivating oyster fields has been recognized as a precious cultural heritage by both local and international parties. However, Fangyuan Township is facing a turning point due to the installation of offshore wind turbines. Development-promoting public agencies and the private sectors are both in need of a new vision of communities in which a viable combination of new, green-energy-based industries and traditional, culture- based industries is allowed to take shape. With that in mind, we reviewed several other localities' experience of green-energy development and its effect on the community. We also analyzed how traditional cultural properties have been incorporated into the tourism industry in Fangyuan Township while also investigating the potential impact of the development of offshore wind farms (OWF) on traditional oyster cultivation there. A series of interviews and meetings with key stakeholders were held to examine, from different points of view, the benefits offered to the community by OWF developers and governmental decision-makers. Our normative case of Fangyuan for providing community benefits by reviving the local culture and encouraging tourism based on both traditional activities and OWF appeared to be received favorably by all involved.

TI  - Optimal control and performance evaluation of an inerter-based point absorber wave energy converter
AB  - This paper deals with optimal tuning, control and performance evaluation of an inerter-based point absorber (IPA) wave energy converter (WEC), which is a first step towards establishing an integrated offshore wind-wave energy system. An inerterâ€“spring system is introduced into a conventional WEC, which can improve the system performance when properly tuned and controlled. Analytical expressions of the optimal IPA parameters have been derived under regular waves. Closed-form solution of the capture width ratio of the IPA under optimal control is obtained and verified by the theoretically optimal solution of a point absorber. Next, hybrid and passive control strategies for the IPA are also investigated, demonstrating superior energy absorption performance than the conventional point absorber under the same control strategy, due to the existence of an extra resonance and amplified motion of the inerter. Furthermore, the performance of passive IPA is evaluated under irregular waves, where parametric optimization has been performed with constraints on system modal frequencies. Single-mode and double-mode resonances have been observed for wave peak frequencies away from and close to the float natural frequency, respectively. This facilitates the frequency adaption of the IPA and the resulting superior performance in terms of more energy absorption and broader operational bandwidth. Â© 2022 The Author(s)

TI  - Flight leader concept for wind farm load counting and performance assessment
AB  - ECN is developing the Flight Leader model, which is based on a concept with which the accumulated mechanical loading of all turbines in an offshore wind farm can be estimated at acceptable costs. This information can be used to optimise and lower the cost of Operation & Maintenance (O&M), for example by prioritising inspections and replacements. In this paper the background and general concept of the Flight Leader model are presented. Key to the application of the Flight Leader concept are the relations between standard (SCADA) signals and load indicators. The more accurate these relations, the more reliable are the calculations of accumulated loading. Using measurements from ECN's EWTW wind farm it will be shown how artificial neural network (ANN) techniques can be used for accurately estimating load indicators using only 10-minute statistics of standard SCADA parameters.

TI  - Contested Spaces in the New Blue Economy: Competing for Connecticutâ€™s Thames River Working Waterfront
AB  - Working waterfront space is limited, leading to competition for coastal space among different waterfront-dependent industries as well as non-waterfront dependent users. Coastal margins will be shrinking as sea levels rise due to climate change, squeezing already scarce port resources, exacerbating competition for these spaces, and generating conflicts. This paper focuses on the competition for waterfront space on the Thames River of Connecticut bordered by the municipalities of New London, Groton, Norwich, Ledyard, and Montville. Emerging wind power in the new Blue Economy looks to reshape port usage in the Thames River. The recent focus on wind generation by the State of Connecticut, coupled with several competitive bidding events for wind-generated electricity, has augmented demand for port space that will serve as a staging area for this offshore development. Although the development of wind power will occur offshore, Connecticut ports are anticipating port use by wind companies with winning bids. This paper explores the processes by which port space has been (re)allocated and contested, and examines the nature of the ensuing conflicts and outcomes.

TI  - Study of a bi-vertical axis turbines farm using the actuator cylinder method
AB  - Vertical axis turbines, which extract kinetic energy from currents, can produce electricity independently from a currentâ€™s direction. Hence, this type of turbines raises interest for harvesting energy from tidal currents, where flow changes direction during flood and ebb tides, and where currents present large variation of direction during tide. Methods for representing vertical axis turbines in tidal farms should be implemented in order to predict correctly power production with an acceptable time cost. The Actuator Cylinder (AC) is one of them. Numerical results in terms of wakes, with the study of velocity profiles, and efforts are compared to experiences, as well as showed that the method is sufficiently accurate and for a reasonable computing time, which is of prime importance for tidal turbines farms studies. The Actuator Cylinder method is implemented in ANSYS Fluent in a 2D stationary resolution. The method is then applied to a double levels of two counter-rotating rotors marine turbine designed by Hydroquest. Wake and power production of a single turbine and several farm configurations are studied under different current conditions (magnitude and direction). Â© 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Exploring the Effect of Length and Angle on NACA 0010 for Diffuser Design in Tidal Current Turbines
AB  - Tidal energy is one of the most predictable forms of renewable energy. Tides posses both potential and kinetic energy. Tidal energy can be utilized by capturing potential energy i.e. by means of tidal barrage and tidal fence or by capturing kinetic energy i.e. by menas of tidal current technologies. This study is focused on diffuser augmented tidal turbines that capture the kinetic energy. The power generated by a tidal turbine is directly proportional to the cube of velocity of current flow. The role of the diffuser in diffuser augmented tidal turbines is to help accelerate the incoming current velocity. Consequently, the efficiency of the turbine is significantly increased by using a diffuser. The research community is investing considerable time and financial resources in this growing domain. The diffuser augmented tidal turbines research data is rather scarce due to their emerging nature, large and costly research \& development setup, startup cost and proprietary issues. The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of length and angle on NACA 0010 airfoil for diffuser design. Numerical simulation is carried out to investigate velocity and mass flow rate at the throat. The drag force due to diffuser installation is also calculated.

AB  - Because of the bad environment of wind farms in the far-reaching sea, the cost of power collector system is high. The contradiction between economy and reliability of the power collector system planning is particularly prominent. According to the particularity of the wind farm in the far-reaching sea and the demand of the power collector system on higher reliability, this paper proposes the definition of topological redundancy of the power collector system and develops a multi-objective optimization model based on the topological redundancy. Thus, the contradictory variables of economy and reliability are optimized. Taking a large-scale offshore wind farm as an example, based on the topological redundancy assessment, the topology of its power collector system is optimized from the perspective of life cycle cost. The results show that, although the initial cost of the optimal redundancy topology is slightly higher than that of the radial structure, the advantage of life cycle cost after 8 years of operation is obvious, which can meet the actual engineering requirements of the power collector system for the wind farm in the far-reaching sea.

AB  - Suction bucket installation in pure clay or pure sand is well established. However, in layered soils, particularly in sand over clay soils, the soil plug uplift is considered a major installation risk and feasibility of installation is often questioned. In this paper, the experience from installation of two suction bucket jackets at two offshore wind farms in layered soils is reported. The installation at both sites was successful and no excess plug uplift was observed. The transfer of suction to the clay-sand interface is believed to have contributed to the success of the installations. The two cases presented in this paper provides confidence in suction bucket foundation installation in similar soil conditions.

TI  - The operational assessment of a floating tidal farm with hydrogen production capabilities
AB  - 1 As the tidal sector progresses, more devices are proposed to harness the energy of water currents. However, the technical and economical viability of these new concepts needs to be assessed in order to support their development. In this paper, following from the previous simulationaided development of a tidal concept, the authors provide an updated assessment considering a floating version of the tidal device. The typical issues encountered by offshore contractors are described, and guidelines for costs and risk minimisation provided. Lifecycle O&M costs are used as a top driver for the development of the project and considerations for the integration of another energy vector, i.e. hydrogen, are provided. The operational assessment is achieved by means of a verified and calibrated modelling tool, based on Monte Carlo simulation able to support the decision-making process and management of the assets. The role of computational tools to improve the profitability of the project while ensuring satisfactory levels of availability and reliability is highlighted, and the specific adjustments implemented to capture the dynamics of floating tidal devices with energy production capabilities discussed.

TI  - Setting an agenda for biofouling research for the marine renewable energy industry
AB  - Extensive marine growth on man-made structures in the ocean is commonplace, yet there has been limited discussion about the potential implications of marine growth for the wave and tidal energy industry. In response, the Environmental Interactions of Marine Renewables (EIMR) Biofouling Expert Workshop was convened. Discussions involved participants from the marine renewable energy (MRE) industry, anti-fouling industry, academic institutions and regulatory bodies. The workshop aimed to consider both the benefits and negative effects of biofouling from engineering and ecological perspectives. In order to form an agenda for future research in the area of biofouling and the marine renewable energy industry, 119 topics were generated, categorised and prioritised. Identified areas for future focus fell within four overarching categories: operation and maintenance; structured design and engineering; ecology; and knowledge exchange. It is clear that understanding and minimising biofouling impacts on MRE infrastructure will be vital to the successful development of a reliable and cost effective MRE industry.
