TI  - Oysters and eelgrass: potential partners in a high pCO(2) ocean
AB  - Climate change is affecting the health and physiology of marine organisms and altering species interactions. Ocean acidification (OA) threatens calcifying organisms such as the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. In contrast, seagrasses, such as the eelgrass Zostera marina, can benefit from the increase in available carbon for photosynthesis found at a lower seawater pH. Seagrasses can remove dissolved inorganic carbon from OA environments, creating local daytime pH refugia. Pacific oysters may improve the health of eelgrass by filtering out pathogens such as Labyrinthula zosterae (LZ), which causes eelgrass wasting disease (EWD). We examined how co-culture of eelgrass ramets and juvenile oysters affected the health and growth of eelgrass and the mass of oysters under different pCO(2) exposures. In Phase I, each species was cultured alone or in co-culture at 12 degrees C across ambient, medium, and high pCO(2) conditions, (656, 1,158 and 1,606 mu atm pCO(2), respectively). Under high pCO(2), eelgrass grew faster and had less severe EWD (contracted in the field prior to the experiment). Co-culture with oysters also reduced the severity of EWD. While the presence of eelgrass decreased daytime pCO(2), this reduction was not substantial enough to ameliorate the negative impact of high pCO(2) on oyster mass. In Phase II, eelgrass alone or oysters and eelgrass in co-culture were held at 15 degrees C under ambient and high pCO(2) conditions, (488 and 2,013atm pCO(2), respectively). Half of the replicates were challenged with cultured LZ. Concentrations of defensive compounds in eelgrass (total phenolics and tannins), were altered by LZ exposure and pCO(2) treatments. Greater pathogen loads and increased EWD severity were detected in LZ exposed eelgrass ramets; EWD severity was reduced at high relative to low pCO(2). Oyster presence did not influence pathogen load or EWD severity; high LZ concentrations in experimental treatments may have masked the effect of this treatment. Collectively, these results indicate that, when exposed to natural concentrations of LZ under high pCO(2) conditions, eelgrass can benefit from co-culture with oysters. Further experimentation is necessary to quantify how oysters may benefit from co-culture with eelgrass, examine these interactions in the field and quantify context-dependency.

TI  - Self-organized sulfide-driven traveling pulses shape seagrass meadows
AB  - Seagrasses provide multiple ecosystem services and act as intense carbon sinks in coastal regions around the globe but are threatened by multiple anthropogenic pressures, leading to enhanced seagrass mortality that reflects in the spatial self-organization of the meadows. Spontaneous spatial vegetation patterns appear in such different ecosystems as drylands, peatlands, salt marshes, or seagrass meadows, and the mechanisms behind this phenomenon are still an open question in many cases. Here, we report on the formation of vegetation traveling pulses creating complex spatiotemporal patterns and rings in Mediterranean seagrass meadows. We show that these structures emerge due to an excitable behavior resulting from the coupled dynamics of vegetation and porewater hydrogen sulfide, toxic to seagrass, in the sediment. The resulting spatiotemporal patterns resemble those formed in other physical, chemical, and biological excitable media, but on a much larger scale. Based on theory, we derive a model that reproduces the observed seascapes and predicts the annihilation of these circular structures as they collide, a distinctive feature of excitable pulses. We show also that the patterns in field images and the empirically resolved radial profiles of vegetation density and sediment sulfide concentration across the structures are consistent with predictions from the theoretical model, which shows these structures to have diagnostic value, acting as a harbinger of the terminal state of the seagrass meadows prior to their collapse.

TI  - Net uptake of atmospheric CO2 by coastal submerged aquatic vegetation
AB  - 'Blue Carbon', which is carbon captured by marine living organisms, has recently been highlighted as a new option for climate change mitigation initiatives. In particular, coastal ecosystems have been recognized as significant carbon stocks because of their high burial rates and long-term sequestration of carbon. However, the direct contribution of Blue Carbon to the uptake of atmospheric CO2 through air-sea gas exchange remains unclear. We performed in situ measurements of carbon flows, including air-sea CO2 fluxes, dissolved inorganic carbon changes, net ecosystem production, and carbon burial rates in the boreal (Furen), temperate (Kurihama), and subtropical (Fukido) seagrass meadows of Japan from 2010 to 2013. In particular, the air-sea CO2 flux was measured using three methods: the bulk formula method, the floating chamber method, and the eddy covariance method. Our empirical results show that submerged autotrophic vegetation in shallow coastal waters can be functionally a sink for atmospheric CO2. This finding is contrary to the conventional perception that most near-shore ecosystems are sources of atmospheric CO2. The key factor determining whether or not coastal ecosystems directly decrease the concentration of atmospheric CO2 may be net ecosystem production. This study thus identifies a new ecosystem function of coastal vegetated systems; they are direct sinks of atmospheric CO2.

TI  - INTEGRATED CARBON BUDGET MODELS FOR THE EVERGLADES TERRESTRIAL-COASTAL-OCEANIC GRADIENT Current Status and Needs for Inter-Site Comparisons
AB  - Recent studies suggest that coastal ecosystems can bury significantly more C than tropical forests, indicating that continued coastal development and exposure to sea level rise and storms will have global biogeochemical consequences. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) site provides an excellent subtropical system for examining carbon (C) balance because of its exposure to historical changes in freshwater distribution and sea level rise and its history of significant long-term carbon-cycling studies. FCE LTER scientists used net ecosystem C balance and net ecosystem exchange data to estimate C budgets for riverine mangrove, freshwater marsh, and seagrass meadows, providing insights into the magnitude of C accumulation and lateral aquatic C transport. Rates of net C production in the riverine mangrove forest exceeded those reported for many tropical systems, including terrestrial forests, but there are considerable uncertainties around those estimates due to the high potential for gain and loss of C through aquatic fluxes. C production was approximately balanced between gain and loss in Everglades marshes; however, the contribution of periphyton increases uncertainty in these estimates. Moreover, while the approaches used for these initial estimates were informative, a resolved approach for addressing areas of uncertainty is critically needed for coastal wetland ecosystems. Once resolved, these C balance estimates, in conjunction with an understanding of drivers and key ecosystem feedbacks, can inform cross-system studies of ecosystem response to long-term changes in climate, hydrologic management, and other land use along coastlines.

TI  - Decline in seagrass carbon uptake on Bonebatang Island, Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia during the period of 2001-2017
AB  - The activities of coastal and small islands communities can have an impact on the condition of the adjacent aquatic ecosystems. The magnitude of the impact depends on the type and intensity of the activities carried out. One ecosystem that is prone to be affected is the seagrass ecosystem due to its presence in shallow waters and proximity to the coast. The study was conducted to examine changes in seagrass carbon uptake on Bonebatang Island over a period of 16 years from 2001 to 2017. Estimation of carbon uptake of seven species of seagrasses, i.e., Enhalus acoroides, Thalassia hemprichii, Cymodocea rotundata, Halodule uninervis. Halophila ovalis, Halophila minor, and Syringodium isoetifolium were carried out using the oxygen change method that utilized clear bottles. The percentage of seagrass coverage was calculated using a 50cm x 50cm plot. The average composition of seagrass species from all plots and the capability of each seagrass species to uptake carbon was used as a basis to estimate the capability of seagrass to uptake the carbon per unit area. Changes in carbon uptake were determined using an approach that estimates changes in the seagrass bed areas. Landsat image analysis was used to estimate the area of seagrass in 2001, 2009, and 2017. The results showed that the area of seagrass beds in the period of 2001-2017 decreased by 8.62 ha, from 37.08 ha in 2001 to 28.46 ha in 2017 or decreased by approximately 1.54\% per year. As a result of this diminishing in the area, carbon uptake by seagrasses was estimated to decrease by 19.67 MgCO2 per year from 79.62 MgCO2 per year in 2001 to 59.95 MgCO2 per year in 2017. The average decrease in a year reached 1.23 MgCO2.

TI  - Shading and simulated grazing increase the sulphide pool and methane emission in a tropical seagrass meadow
AB  - Though seagrass meadows are among the most productive habitats in the world, contributing substantially to long-term carbon storage, studies of the effects of critical disturbances on the fate of carbon sequestered in the sediment and biomass of these meadows are scarce. In a manipulative in situ experiment, we studied the effects of successive loss of seagrass biomass as a result of shading and simulated grazing at two intensity levels on sulphide (H2S) content and methane (CH4) emission in a tropical seagrass meadow in Zanzibar (Tanzania). In all disturbed treatments, we found a several-fold increase in both the sulphide concentration of the sediment pore-water and the methane emissions from the sediment surface (except for CH4 emissions in the low-shading treatment). This could be due to the ongoing degradation of belowground biomass shed by the seagrass plants, supporting the production of both sulphate-reducing bacteria and methanogens, possibly exacerbated by the loss of downwards oxygen transport via seagrass plants. The worldwide rapid loss of seagrass areas due to anthropogenic activities may therefore have significant effects on carbon sink-source relationships within coastal seas.

TI  - Carbon budgets for Caribbean mangrove forests of varying structure and with phosphorus enrichment
AB  - There are few detailed carbon (C) budgets of mangrove forests, yet these are important for understanding C sequestration in mangrove forests, how they support the productivity of the coast and their vulnerability to environmental change. Here, we develop C budgets for mangroves on the islands of Twin Cays, Belize. We consider seaward fringing forests and interior scrub forests that have been fertilized with phosphorus (P), which severely limits growth of trees in the scrub forests. We found that respiration of the aboveground biomass accounted for 60%-80% of the fixed C and that respiration of the canopy and aboveground roots were important components of respiration. Soil respiration accounted for only 7%-11% of total gross primary production (GPP) while burial of C in soils was ~4% of GPP. Respiration by roots can account for the majority of soil respiration in fringing forests, while microbial processes may account 80% of respiration in scrub forests. Fertilization of scrub forests with P enhanced GPP but the proportion of C buried declined to ~2% of GPP. Net ecosystem production was 17%-27% of GPP similar to that reported for other mangrove forests. Carbon isotope signatures of adjacent seagrass suggest that dissolved C from mangroves is exported into the adjacent ecosystems. Our data indicate that C budgets can vary among mangrove forest types and with nutrient enrichment and that low productivity mangroves provide a disproportionate share of exported C.

TI  - Incorporating coastal blue carbon into subnational greenhouse gas inventories
AB  - The climate mitigation potential of coastal blue carbon including mangroves, seagrasses and tidal marshes have been widely recognized, and guidelines for incorporating coastal wetlands into greenhouse gas inventories released by IPCC in 2014 make it possible to bring coastal blue carbon into multilevel climate governance regimes. However, the intricate guidelines and inadequate data block governments from accounting and reporting their coastal blue carbon in inventories. In this research, we integrated and simplified the equations and assumptions of IPCC inventory guidance on coastal wetlands, and took Hainan province of China as a case study by (1) formulating a land use change matrix from high resolution satellite imagery for the years of 2010 to 2020, (2) compiling dataset of emission factors for coastal wetlands of Hainan, and (3) estimating CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from coastal wetlands in Hainan. We reveal that the mangroves' area increased from 4,190.7 ha in 2010 to 4,644.1 ha in 2020, with a net increase of 483.9 ha from tidal flats and aquaculture ponds. The weighted average EFAGB and EFsoil of Hainan is 61.7 MgC ha(-1) and 227.4 MgC ha(-1), respectively,estimated from peer-reviewed literature in both Chinese and English. The annual average net CO2 emission of mangroves of Hainan is -26974.3 MgCO(2)e yr(-1). CO2 emission from mangrove deforestation and N2O emission from shrimp aquaculture in coastal aeras may offset the efforts of coastal wetlands conservation and restoration. Countries and sub-country regions are encouraged to bring coastal blue carbon into greenhouse gases inventories as soon as possible, and to take a bottom-up strategy to initiate the task at a local level.

TI  - Changes to the structure of tropical seagrass meadows (Halophila decipiens) in the warm-temperate waters of the southwest Atlantic
AB  - Keystone species are on the move globally and understanding how these new arrivals integrate into their new environments will become increasingly important. We monitored the development of range-expanded seagrass meadows (Halophila decipiens) in the warm temperate waters of the Sao Sebastido channel (SSC), Brazil. Following its first description in the summer of 2014, the meadows formed by this species have increased in terms of average patch size (3.6 x greater), biomass (3.8 x greater and 4.6 x greater, respectively for above and below ground biomass) and have been associated with increases in sediment organic carbon (C-org) stocks (2.6 x greater). We conclude that this traditionally pan-tropical species will play an increasingly important role in the structure (e.g., providing habitat for fauna), productivity (e.g., food resources) and carbon storage potential of shallow coastal waters in the southwest Atlantic.

TI  - Ecosystem type drives tea litter decomposition and associated prokaryotic microbiome communities in freshwater and coastal wetlands at a continental scale
AB  - Wetland ecosystems are critical to the regulation of the global carbon cycle, and there is a high demand for data to improve carbon sequestration and emission models and predictions. Decomposition of plant litter is an important component of ecosystem carbon cycling, yet a lack of knowledge on decay rates in wetlands is an impediment to predicting carbon preservation. Here, we aim to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying the decomposition of standardised green and rooibos tea litter over one year within freshwater and coastal wetland soils across four climates in Australia. We also captured changes in the prokaryotic members of the tea-associated microbiome during this process. Ecosystem type drove differences in tea decay rates and prokaryotic microbiome community composition. Decomposition rates were up to 2-fold higher in mangrove and seagrass soils compared to freshwater wetlands and tidal marshes, in part due to greater leaching-related mass loss. For tidal marshes and freshwater wetlands, the warmer climates had 7â€“16% less mass remaining compared to temperate climates after a year of decomposition. The prokaryotic microbiome community composition was significantly different between substrate types and sampling times within and across ecosystem types. Microbial indicator analyses suggested putative metabolic pathways common across ecosystems were used to breakdown the tea litter, including increased presence of putative methylotrophs and sulphur oxidisers linked to the introduction of oxygen by root in-growth over the incubation period. Structural equation modelling analyses further highlighted the importance of incubation time on tea decomposition and prokaryotic microbiome community succession, particularly for rooibos tea that experienced a greater proportion of mass loss between three and twelve months compared to green tea. These results provide insights into ecosystem-level attributes that affect both the abiotic and biotic controls of belowground wetland carbon turnover at a continental scale, while also highlighting new decay dynamics for tea litter decomposing under longer incubations.

TI  - Seagrass Ecosystem and Climate Change: An Indian Perspective
AB  - The significance of the seagrass ecosystem as global carbon sinks has been well studied worldwide; however, studies in India are sparse. Most research in India focuses on the distribution and ecology of seagrass and biogeochemistry has often been less studied. This paper describes the potential carbon sequestration, particularly carbon burial and uptake by seagrass ecosystems of India. The results reported the higher dissolved carbon uptake rates by seagrass ecosystem followed by high net ecosystem productivity. Below ground biomass dominated in the seagrass ecosystem which is a storehouse of buried carbon. High storage capacity of seagrass ecosystem is described through a case study of Chilika lagoon where the carbon pool in the biomass and sediments were observed to range from 2.3 to 2.5 Gg C and 4.5 to 5.7 Gg C respectively. The study emphasized on the need of focused research, particularly, on the role of carbon in seagrass ecosystems in India.

TI  - Seagrass diversity and carbon sequestration: Case study on Pari Island, Jakarta Bay, Indonesia
AB  - Pari Island is located in Kepulauan Seribu chain. As a tourist destination, the seagrass ecosystem at the island is constantly under pressure from time to time. An effort to prevent widespread damage is to designate parts of the coastline as a limited access research centre. Efforts to study seagrass ecosystem on Pari Island are ongoing, including studies on seagrass' ability to sequestrate carbon. This quantitative study was conducted in December 2014. Surveys are done on the abundance and density of seagrass in 122 plots (area = 50 Ã— 50 cm2) which spread in 6 research stations. Biomass measurements were performed by extractive method on 4 types of seagrass (Cymodocea serrulata, Halophila ovalis, Halodule uninervis and Syringodium isoetifolium). The assessment of seagrass capability in storing carbon has been done by measuring the primary productivity of above ground and below ground, while the amount of carbon released is measured from littered leaves and the leaves eaten by herbivores.The findings show that there are 7 of 12 species of seagrass identified in Indonesia, i.e. Cymodoceae rotundata, Cymodoceae serrulata, Thalassia hemprichii, Enhalus acoroides, Syringodium isoetifolium, Halodule uninervis and Halophila ovalis. The dominant species is Thalassia hemprichii (density 200Â±153, 261Â±107 and 117Â±52 stands/m2) and Halodule uninervis (82Â±59 stands/m2).Seagrassâ€™ carbon sequestration capacity in the waters surrounding Pari Island, Jakarta Bay, is approximately 0.006-1.048 gC/m2/day whereas carbon reserves are between 0.24-346.10 gC/m2.

TI  - Seagrass and macrophyte mediated CO2 and CH4 dynamics in shallow coastal waters
AB  - Seagrass meadows are among the most important coastal/ marine ecosystems for longterm carbon storage and conditioning of coastal waters. A combined air-water flux of CO2 and CH4 from the seagrass meadows was studied for the first time from Asia's largest brackish-water lagoon, Chilika, India. Ecosystem-based comparisons were carried out during two hydrologically different conditions of dry and wet seasons in the seagrass dominated southern sector (SS); macrophyte-dominated northern sector (NS); the largely un-vegetated central sector (CS) and the tidally active outer channel (OC) of the lagoon. The mean fluxes of CO2 from SS, NS, CS and OC were 9.8, 146.6, 48.4 and 33.0mM m-2d-1, and that of CH4 were 0.12, 0.11, 0.05 and 0.07mM m-2d-1, respectively. The net emissions (in terms of CO2 equivalents), considering the global warming potential of CO2 (GWP: 1) and CH4 (GWP: 28) from seagrass meadows were over 14 times lower compared to the macrophyte-dominated sector of the lagoon. Contrasting emissivity characteristics of CO2 and CH4 were observed between macrophytes and seagrass, with the former being a persistent source of CO2. It is inferred that although seagrass meadows act as a weak source of CH4, they could be effective sinks of CO2 if land-based pollution sources are minimized. Copyright: Â© 2018 Banerjee et al.

TI  - The influence of seagrass and its associated sediment on organic carbon storage: A case of Halodule uninervis and Syringodium isoetifolium meadows of Western India Ocean, Tanzania
AB  - Seagrass meadows are considered crucial natural carbon stocks. However, in Tanzania, few species have been assessed for their potential carbon stocks and variability in percentage organic carbon (%Corg) stocks. The study reports the contributions of seagrasses Halodule uninervis and Syringodium isoetifolium in carbon storage in WIO region. Findings revealed a significantly higher %Corg in seagrass meadows compared to unvegetated, confirming that seagrass heightens organic carbon storage. The seagrass carbon storage varied significantly among sites ranging from 4.05 Â± 0.7% in Kaole to 0.62 Â± 0.05% in Kunduchi. Syringodium isoetifolium meadows had higher organic carbon (p = 0.002) than H. uninervis. The partial least square analysis showed that below- and aboveground biomass and canopy height were positively correlated to %Corg. Sediment density and porosity were the vital predictor but negatively correlated with %Corg. The study showed a higher %Corg in the marine protected area, which could be linked to seagrass structural complexities and sediment porosity. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - The potential of seagrass beds on the coast of Putri Menjangan as a carbon sequestration ecosystem on Bali Island
AB  - Seagrass beds are one of the coastal ecosystems with high productivity. Seagrass beds have also an ability to absorb carbon then store it as carbon stock. One of the potential seagrass beds located on the coast of Putri Menjangan, Regency of Buleleng, Province of Bali. This research aims to assess 1) the value of carbon sequestration, 2) the potential of carbon stock, and 3) carbon stocks value differences between below ground (Blg) and above ground (Abg). Collecting data includes measuring seagrass density, leaves productivity, dry biomass, and carbon content. There were 5 species of seagrasses, i.e., Thalassia hemprichii, Cymodocea rotundata, Halodule pinifolia, Halodule uninervis, Halophila ovalis, which exists in the area. Species of Cymodocea rotundata and Thalassia hemprichii dominate the seagrass beds on the field. Carbon sequestration by seagrass on the coast of Putri Menjangan was 1.45 gC/m2/day. Total carbon stocks (Abg+Blg) was 52.06 gC/m2 which the Blg carbon stocks was twice greater (67\%) than the Abg carbon stocks (33\%). These results suggested that the potential of seagrass beds in absorbing and storing carbon on the coast of Putri Menjangan was quite vast; therefore it is necessary to protect and preserve seagrass vegetation following the land use change and local development.

TI  - Salt Marsh: Ecologically Important, Yet Least Studied Blue Carbon Ecosystems in India
AB  - Salt marshes are intertidal halophytic vegetations, distributed in mid to lower latitudes. They provide important ecosystem services, including transportation and remineralization of nutrients, habitat for coastal biota, coastal bioshield, biofilters and recreation and cultural benefits. In India, 15 salt marsh species so far have been reported, spread over 1600 km(2). Salt marshes are known to adapt themselves to the changing environmental conditions fairly quickly by maintaining a balance between the existing pressures and the prevailing state. Thus, they tend to retain a long-term ecosystem sustainability under changing environmental conditions. Recent studies have recognized them for their extraordinary capacity of carbon sequestration, which gives them edge amongst the coastal ecosystems, but the carbon stock is comparatively low due to their alarming decline in global areal extent. In the Indian context, salt marshes occupy a significant share of the coastline along with the other blue carbon ecosystems like mangroves and seagrasses. This provides India with a very promising alternative for achieving its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution towards climate change mitigation through enhancing additional carbon sinks (INDC goal \# 5). But, despite its rich salt marsh diversity and distribution along the entire coastline, Indian salt marshes are one of the most overlooked coastal ecosystems. The documented studies on the Indian marshes are relatively scarce and studies addressing their carbon storage and climate change mitigation potential are totally non-existent. There is an urgent need for targeted scientific studies to be taken up on the Indian salt marsh ecosystems to develop a holistic and updated database, which can support resource management, decisionmaking and facilitate to estimate Blue carbon economy of India.

TI  - The sediment carbon stocks of intertidal seagrass meadows in Scotland
AB  - Seagrasses are highly productive ecosystems and hotspots for biodiversity, providing a plethora of benefits to the environment and to people. Their value in sequestering and storing carbon is increasingly being recognised, as the world searches for ways to mitigate the effects and slow the pace of climate change. However, many uncertainties remain, with basic information such as average carbon stocks, variability and species-specific differences missing for many regions. This study evaluates, for the first time, the carbon storage capacity of Zostera noltii and Zostera marina from intertidal seagrass meadows in Scotland. Sediment carbon stocks in the top 50 cm from vegetated and reference unvegetated plots were quantified at 10 estuaries distributed along the Scottish east and west coasts. The organic carbon stocks in the top 50 cm of the seagrass sediment ranged from a minimum of 14.94 Mg C ha-1 at the Moray Firth to a maximum of 105.72 Mg C ha-1 at the Firth of Forth, with a mean (+/- SD) of 54.79 +/- 35.02 Mg C ha-1 across the 10 estuaries sampled. Moreover, seagrass areas showed enhanced carbon storage compared to reference unvegetated ones, however this was highly variable across depth, and among sites and estuaries. This paper addresses key gaps in knowledge concerning the role of intertidal Scottish seagrass meadows as carbon sinks and discusses the implication of this emerging information for their effective management and conservation.

TI  - Iron additions reduce sulfide intrusion and reverse seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) decline in carbonate sediments
AB  - We conducted a 2-year in situ experiment to test the capacity of iron additions to reverse the decline experienced by a Posidonia oceanica meadow colonizing carbonate, iron poor sediment. Iron additions improved the sediment conditions that support seagrass growth by decreasing the sediment sulfide concentration and sulfate reduction rates, and decreased sulfide intrusion into the plants. Iron additions for 2 years did not significantly change survivorship of shoots present at the onset of the experiment, but significantly increased shoot recruitment and survivorship of shoots recruited during the experiment. After 2 years, iron additions reversed seagrass decline and yielded positive growth rates of shoots relative to control populations where seagrass continued to decline. This research demonstrates that seagrass decline in carbonate sediments may be reversed by targeting critical processes such are sediment sulfide pools and seagrass nutritional status, controlling the functioning of the ecosystem.

TI  - Community metabolism and carbon budget along a gradient of seagrass (Cymodocea nodosa) colonization
AB  - We studied the effect of seagrass (Cymodocea nodosa) colonization on community metabolism and sediment conditions. The biomass of C nodosa increased with time after seagrass colonization. The biomass increased steadily during the 6.1 yr of colonization to 9.1 mol C m(-2). Gross primary production increased from 7 to 49.3 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) during the first stages of the colonization and then decreased to 20 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) at a time when the biomass was in excess of 6 Mol C m(-2). Net dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes increased with time after colonization, shifting from a net uptake in patches younger than 2 yr to a net release in older patches. Community respiration (R) increased with the seagrass colonization, leading to a shift from net autotrophy in the unvegetated sediment community to net heterotrophy after C. nodosa colonization. The increase in net heterotrophy with seagrass colonization was reflected in the development of reducing conditions in the sediment. To maintain a net heterotrophic benthic metabolism and net DOC release, the C. nodosa community must receive an input of organic matter (OM) from an allochthonous source. OM inputs from sestonic material trapped by the seagrass canopy exceed 157 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) in developed C. nodosa communities. Thus, the seagrass community acts as an important link between the pelagic and benthic communities by trapping sestonic organic carbon.

TI  - Total ecosystem carbon stocks at the marine-terrestrial interface: Blue carbon of the Pacific Northwest Coast, United States

Yet, little data exist for the carbon stocks of major tidal wetland types in the Pacific Northwest, United States. We quantified the total ecosystem carbon stocks (TECS) in seagrass, emergent marshes, and forested tidal wetlands, occurring along increasing elevation and decreasing salinity gradients. The TECS included the total aboveground carbon stocks and the entire soil profile (to as deep as 3Â m). TECS significantly increased along the elevation and salinity gradients: 217Â Â±Â 60Â MgÂ C/ha for seagrass (low elevation/high salinity), 417Â Â±Â 70Â MgÂ C/ha for low marsh, 551Â Â±Â 47Â MgÂ C/ha for high marsh, and 1,064Â Â±Â 38Â MgÂ C/ha for tidal forest (high elevation/low salinity). Soil carbon stocks accounted for >98% of TECS in the seagrass and marsh communities and 78% in the tidal forest. Soils in the 0â€“100Â cm portion of the profile accounted for only 48%â€“53% of the TECS in seagrasses and marshes and 34% of the TECS in tidal forests. Thus, the commonly applied limit defining TECS to a 100Â cm depth would greatly underestimate both carbon stocks and potential greenhouse gas emissions from land-use conversion. The large carbon stocks coupled with other ecosystem services suggest value in the conservation and restoration of temperate zone tidal wetlands through climate change mitigation strategies. However, the findings suggest that long-term sea-level rise effects such as tidal inundation and increased porewater salinity will likely decrease ecosystem carbon stocks in the absence of upslope wetland migration buffer zones.

TI  - The potential and constraints of wind farm development at nearshore sites in the Maltese Islands
AB  - The electrical energy requirements of the Maltese Islands are met in their entirety by two oil-fired electrical generation plants. In view of this complete dependence upon fossil fuels, investigations into the prospects of diversifying electrical generation by resorting to renewable energy technologies are particularly relevant. The archipelago has peculiar characteristics such as high population density, comparatively deep coastal waters and an economy based on tourism, manufacturing, marine-sector activities and services that make the integration of wind power generation projects challenging. Local government authorities commissioned the authors to assess the constraints related to wind farm development in a shallow water coastal area, known as is-Sikka l-Bajda, which could present a wind potential worth exploiting, and to recommend adequate mitigation measures to minimize any impacts and conflicts with stakeholders. These constraints include marine navigational aspects, fishing and aquaculture, tourism and other site-specific activities. Environmental constraints exist including the fact that the site is characterized by extensive seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) meadows, that it is a priority habitat under the EU Habitats Directive, and that the site itself is a reef - another priority habitat within the same directive. The proposed near-shore site is also in the vicinity of a protected coastal bird rafting and bird nesting site for the Yelkouan Shearwater species. Submarine noise generation - particularly during the construction phase - is also of concern in view of the regular sighting of marine mammals in Maltese coastal waters. In the site evaluation exercise, another secondary site in the Maltese Islands, located off the north Gozo coast, was also assessed. Mitigation measures specific to the Sikka l-Bajda site proposed by the authors include the deployment of silt curtains, bubble screens and unobtrusive turbine lighting devices and avoiding utilisation of the reef area closest to the protected bird colony. Such measures also relate to the choice of the array design to minimise visual impact and to the period of the year when wind plant construction and deployment should take place to minimize impact on avifaunal populations. By declaring the marine area contiguous to the proposed nearshore wind facility development as off-limits to fishing vessels, a de facto 'No-take' Marine Protected Area can also be effectively instituted. One also expects submerged components of the nearshore wind facility to be colonized within a brief period by a diverse fouling community and that the same components act as Fish Aggregating Devices (FAD's), greatly enhancing fish populations in the area. In view of the current paucity in Mediterranean nearshore wind power facilities, the proposed project could potentially serve as a pilot project for the whole region, and also become a tourist attraction.

TI  - The Bloom-Forming Macroalgae, Ulva, Outcompetes the Seagrass, Zostera marina, Under High CO2 Conditions
AB  - While multiple species of macroalgae and seagrass can benefit from elevated CO2 concentrations, competition between such organisms may influence their ultimate responses. This study reports on experiments performed with a Northwest Atlantic species of the macroalgae, Ulva, and the seagrass, Zostera marina, grown under ambient and elevated levels of pCO(2), and subjected to competition with each other. When grown individually, elevated pCO(2) significantly increased growth rates and productivity of Ulva and Zostera, respectively, beyond control treatments (by threefold and 27\%, respectively). For both primary producers, significant declines in tissue C-13 signatures suggested that increased growth and productivity were associated with a shift from use of HCO3- toward CO2 use. When grown under higher pCO(2), Zostera experienced significant increases in leaf and rhizome carbon content as well as significant increases in leaf carbon-to-nitrogen ratios, while sediments within which high CO(2)Zostera were grown had a significantly higher organic carbon content. When grown in the presence of Ulva; however, above- and below-ground productivity and tissue nitrogen content of Zostera were significantly lower, revealing an antagonistic interaction between elevated CO2 and the presence of Ulva. The presence of Zostera had no significant effect on the growth of Ulva. Collectively, this study demonstrates that while Ulva and Zostera can each individually benefit from elevated pCO(2) levels, the ability of Ulva to grow more rapidly and inhibit seagrass productivity under elevated pCO(2), coupled with accumulation of organic C in sediments, may offset the potential benefits for Zostera within high CO2 environments.

TI  - Seagrasses, the Unique Adaptation of Angiosperms to the Marine Environment: Effect of High Carbon and Ocean Acidification on Energetics and Ion Homeostasis
AB  - As a functional group, seagrasses form highly productive ecosystems present along the coasts of all continents (except Antarctica), where they rival tropical rainforests and coral reefs in ecosystem services (Costanza et al., 1997; Fourqurean et al., 2012). Unfortunately, seagrasses are diminishing worldwide and several studies confirm a lack of appreciation for the value of these systems (Cullen-Unsworth et al., 2014). Since the last century, the effects of climate change on natural and agricultural terrestrial plant communities have already received significant attention, but relatively little emphasis has been given to aquatic plant communities, including seagrasses (Koch et al., 2013). Here we analyse the potential impact of global atmospheric CO2 increase on the adaptation mechanisms of these vascular plants to marine environments, highlighting the effects on membrane energization, nutrient uptake and cytosolic ion homeostasis.

TI  - Tracing organic matter sources and carbon burial in mangrove sediments over the past 160 years
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems may be a source of organic carbon and nutrients to adjacent coastal systems on one hand and provide a sedimentary sink for organic carbon on the other. The balance between these two functions may be sensitive to both natural and anthropogenically induced variability, yet these effects have not been thoroughly evaluated in mangrove ecosystems. We determine organic matter sources and carbon burial rates over the past 160 years in three lagoons on the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Carbon isotopes and C/N elemental ratios are utilized to trace the three sources contributing to sedimentary organic matter, mangroves, seagrasses and phytoplankton, while nitrogen isotopes are used to elucidate potential post-depositional biogeochemical transformations in mangrove lagoon sediments. All three organic matter sources contribute to organic carbon burial. Phytoplankton and mangroves are the dominant sources of organic matter in lagoon bank sediments and seagrasses are a significant source to central lagoon sediments. Organic carbon burial rates are higher at the lagoon fringes, where mangrove vegetation dominates, than in seagrass-dominated mid-lagoon areas. A reduction in mangrove contribution to the sedimentary organic matter pool concurrent with reduced total organic carbon burial rates is observed in the recent past at all three lagoons studied. Natural cycles in sediment organic matter source over the past 160 years are observed in a high-resolution core. These fluctuations correspond to climatic variability in this region, as recorded in deep-sea foraminiferal assemblages. Additional work is required in order to differentiate between recent anthropogenic perturbations and natural variability in organic carbon sources and burial rates within these ecosystems.

TI  - Seagrass Restoration Enhances ``Blue Carbon{''} Sequestration in Coastal Waters
AB  - Seagrass meadows are highly productive habitats that provide important ecosystem services in the coastal zone, including carbon and nutrient sequestration. Organic carbon in seagrass sediment, known as ``blue carbon,{''} accumulates from both in situ production and sedimentation of particulate carbon from the water column. Using a large-scale restoration (>1700 ha) in the Virginia coastal bays as a model system, we evaluated the role of seagrass, Zostera marina, restoration in carbon storage in sediments of shallow coastal ecosystems. Sediments of replicate seagrass meadows representing different age treatments (as time since seeding: 0, 4, and 10 years), were analyzed for \% carbon, \% nitrogen, bulk density, organic matter content, and Pb-210 for dating at 1-cm increments to a depth of 10 cm. Sediment nutrient and organic content, and carbon accumulation rates were higher in 10-year seagrass meadows relative to 4-year and bare sediment. These differences were consistent with higher shoot density in the older meadow. Carbon accumulation rates determined for the 10-year restored seagrass meadows were 36.68 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Within 12 years of seeding, the restored seagrass meadows are expected to accumulate carbon at a rate that is comparable to measured ranges in natural seagrass meadows. This the first study to provide evidence of the potential of seagrass habitat restoration to enhance carbon sequestration in the coastal zone.

TI  - The Sources of Organic Matter in Seagrass Sediments and Their Contribution to Carbon Stocks in the Spermonde Islands, Indonesia
AB  - Seagrass ecosystems have a potential role in climate change mitigation due to their ability to store high amount of carbon, particularly in the sediment. Studying the factors and mechanisms responsible for this storing capacity is essential to understand seagrass carbon sink function. Therefore, in this study, we identified the sources of organic carbon (Corg) in seagrass sediments and the implication to Corg stocks from four islands in the Spermonde Islands that located at different zones. We used the Bayesian stable isotope mixing modelÂ to estimate the proportional contribution of different sources to sediment carbon. Seagrass meadows that located in adjacent to high anthropogenic activities (deforestation and aquacultures) with direct exposure to wave actions, such as on the Bauluang Island, accumulated organic carbon that derived from multiple sources, where phytoplankton contributed the highest, while on the other three islands that are relatively protected from wave actions, the highest contribution (~ 75%) was from autochthonous production (seagrass-derived). Sediment Corg stocks vary spatially, ranging from 11.9 to 32.1Â Mg C haâˆ’1 (based on the obtained depth of 20â€“55Â cm), or 40.5 to 83.5Â Mg C haâˆ’1 if extrapolated to 1Â m depth. The variability of sediment properties and Corg stocks in this study is not solely determined by the geographical differences (inshore, nearshore and offshore islands), but also influenced by other local factors such as hydrodynamics that control the distribution of carbon sources, anthropogenic pressures and species composition. These factors should be taken into account when developing coastal management strategies, as efforts are being undertaken to include coastal ecosystems (including seagrass ecosystems) on the National Green House Gasses Reduction Strategy.

TI  - Carbon-concentrating mechanisms in seagrasses
AB  - Seagrasses are unique angiosperms that carry out growth and reproduction submerged in seawater. They occur in at least three families of the Alismatales. All have chloroplasts mainly in the cells of the epidermis. Living in seawater, the supply of inorganic carbon (Ci) to the chloroplasts is diffusion limited, especially under unstirred conditions. Therefore, the supply of CO2 and bicarbonate across the diffusive boundary layer on the outer side of the epidermis is often a limiting factor. Here we discuss the evidence for mechanisms that enhance the uptake of Ci into the epidermal cells. Since bicarbonate is plentiful in seawater, a bicarbonate pump might be expected; however, the evidence for such a pump is not strongly supported. There is evidence for a carbonic anhydrase outside the outer plasmalemma. This, together with evidence for an outward proton pump, suggests the possibility that local acidification leads to enhanced concentrations of CO2 adjacent to the outer tangential epidermal walls, which enhances the uptake of CO2, and this could be followed by a carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM) in the cytoplasm and/or chloroplasts. The lines of evidence for such an epidermal CCM are discussed, including evidence for special 'transfer cells' in some but not all seagrass leaves in the tangential inner walls of the epidermal cells. It is concluded that seagrasses have a CCM but that the case for concentration of CO2 at the site of Rubisco carboxylation is not proven. Â© The Author 2017.

TI  - Seagrass ecosystem response to long-term high CO2 in a Mediterranean volcanic vent
AB  - We examined the long-term effect of naturally acidified water on a Cymodocea nodosa meadow growing at a shallow volcanic CO2 vent in Vulcano Island (Italy). Seagrass and adjacent unvegetated habitats growing at a low pH station (pH = 7.65 Â± 0.02) were compared with corresponding habitats at a control station (pH = 8.01 Â± 0.01). Density and biomass showed a clear decreasing trend at the low pH station and the below- to above-ground biomass ratio was more than 10 times lower compared to the control. C content and Î´13C of leaves and epiphytes were significantly lower at the low pH station. Photosynthetic activity of C. nodosa was stimulated by low pH as seen by the significant increase in Chla content of leaves, maximum electron transport rate and compensation irradiance. Seagrass community metabolism was intense at the low pH station, with significantly higher net community production, respiration and gross primary production than the control community, whereas metabolism of the unvegetated community did not differ between stations. Productivity was promoted by the low pH, but this was not translated into biomass, probably due to nutrient limitation, grazing or poor environmental conditions. The results indicate that seagrass response in naturally acidified conditions is dependable upon species and geochemical characteristics of the site and highlight the need for a better understanding of complex interactions in these environments.

TI  - Rapid monitoring of seagrass biomass using a simple linear modelling approach, in the field and from space
AB  - Seagrass meadows are globally significant carbon sinks and increasingly threatened; and seagrass habitat provides critical ecosystem services, for which above-ground biomass is a key indicator. The capacity to quantify biomass in seagrass ecosystems is both critical and urgent, yet no methods exist to perform this at the large spatial scale required for management (e.g. regional/continental). We built linear model relationships between in situ above-ground biomass and seagrass percentage cover per seagrass species to esti mate biomass from both point-based and landscape scale (>100 km(2)) seagrass data. First we used a set of linear models to estimate the biomass component of each seagrass species in over 20 000 benthic photos. We then adapted this approach to estimate biomass from a time-series of remote sensing derived seagrass percentage cover and dominant species maps. We demonstrate accurate estimation of above-ground biomass using a set of methods that is not only more time and resource efficient than existing methods, but is sufficiently robust and generalisable for application at large spatial or temporal scales. Our method allows for quantification of above-ground biomass in seagrass ecosystems over spatial scales larger than can be tractably assessed using current site-and point-based measurement approaches, and at scales that are required to understand and manage seagrass systems to tackle anthropogenic climate change and other impacts.

TI  - Ocean Acidification and the Loss of Phenolic Substances in Marine Plants
AB  - Rising atmospheric CO2 often triggers the production of plant phenolics, including many that serve as herbivore deterrents, digestion reducers, antimicrobials, or ultraviolet sunscreens. Such responses are predicted by popular models of plant defense, especially resource availability models which link carbon availability to phenolic biosynthesis. CO2 availability is also increasing in the oceans, where anthropogenic emissions cause ocean acidification, decreasing seawater pH and shifting the carbonate system towards further CO2 enrichment. Such conditions tend to increase seagrass productivity but may also increase rates of grazing on these marine plants. Here we show that high CO2 / low pH conditions of OA decrease, rather than increase, concentrations of phenolic protective substances in seagrasses and eurysaline marine plants. We observed a loss of simple and polymeric phenolics in the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa near a volcanic CO2 vent on the Island of Vulcano, Italy, where pH values decreased from 8.1 to 7.3 and pCO(2) concentrations increased ten-fold. We observed similar responses in two estuarine species, Ruppia maritima and Potamogeton perfoliatus, in in situ Free-Ocean-Carbon-Enrichment experiments conducted in tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay, USA. These responses are strikingly different than those exhibited by terrestrial plants. The loss of phenolic substances may explain the higher-than-usual rates of grazing observed near undersea CO2 vents and suggests that ocean acidification may alter coastal carbon fluxes by affecting rates of decomposition, grazing, and disease. Our observations temper recent predictions that seagrasses would necessarily be ``winners{''} in a high CO2 world.

TI  - The role of seagrass ecosystem in small islands as a blue carbon in climate change mitigation in Indonesia (case study: Lembeh Island, Bitung Regency)
AB  - Climate change phenomenon has occurred equally and globally all over the world during the last century, including Indonesia, which known as an archipelagic country with more than 17.000 islands, where most of the island considered as small islands. Lembeh Island known by its high biodiversity in marine resources, especially coral reef which associated with other coastal ecosystems such as mangrove and seagrasses and create a healthy environment. Seagrasses as a blue carbon ecosystem can be functioned as a carbon absorber from the atmosphere and storage in the sediment, and supported the climate change mitigation act in Indonesia. Based on field observation, Lembeh Island region has seven species from possible twelve seagrass species found in Indonesia. Enhalus acoroides and Thalassia Hemprichii dominated the seagrass existence in Lembeh Island with certain characteristics live in a sandy substrate, muddy area or coral reefs. Seagrass in Lembeh Island has potency on biomass carbon as much as 0.96 Â± 1.327 MgCha-1 (mostly autochthonous), which lower than the potency of carbon stored in sediment reached more than 40 MgCha-1 (mostly allochthonous). Seagrass ecosystem play an important role in climate change mitigation act and should be supported, developed and collaborated with other coastal ecosystems sucha as coral reefs and mangroves.

TI  - Dynamics of methane in mangrove forest: Will it worsen with decreasing mangrove forests?
AB  - Mangrove forests sequester a significant amount of organic matter in their sediment and are recognized as an important carbon storage source (i.e., blue carbon, including in seagrass ecosystems and other coastal wetlands). The methane-producing archaea in anaerobic sediments releases methane, a greenhouse gas species. The contribution to total greenhouse gas emissions from mangrove ecosystems remains controversial. However, the intensity CH4 emissions from anaerobic mangrove sediment is known to be sensitive to environmental changes, and the sediment is exposed to oxygen by methanotrophic (CH4-oxidizing) bacteria as well as to anthropogenic impacts and climate change in mangrove forests. This review discusses the major factors decreasing the effect of mangroves on CH4 emissions from sediment, the significance of ecosystem protection regarding forest biomass and the hydrosphere/soil environment, and how to evaluate emission status geospatially. An innovative â€œdigital-twinâ€ system overcoming the difficulty of field observation is required for suggesting sustainable mitigation in mangrove ecosystems, such as a locally/regionally/globally heterogenous environment with various random factors.

TI  - Role of carbonate burial in Blue Carbon budgets
AB  - Calcium carbonates (CaCO3) often accumulate in mangrove and seagrass sediments. As CaCO3 production emits CO2, there is concern that this may partially offset the role of Blue Carbon ecosystems as CO2 sinks through the burial of organic carbon (C-org). A global collection of data on inorganic carbon burial rates (C-inorg, 12\% of CaCO3 mass) revealed global rates of 0.8 TgC(inorg) yr(-1) and 15-62 TgC(inorg) yr(-1) in mangrove and seagrass ecosystems, respectively. In seagrass, CaCO3 burial may correspond to an offset of 30\% of the net CO2 sequestration. However, a mass balance assessment highlights that the C-inorg burial is mainly supported by inputs from adjacent ecosystems rather than by local calcification, and that Blue Carbon ecosystems are sites of net CaCO3 dissolution. Hence, CaCO3 burial in Blue Carbon ecosystems contribute to seabed elevation and therefore buffers sea-level rise, without undermining their role as CO2 sinks.

TI  - Role of vegetated coastal ecosystems as nitrogen and phosphorous filters and sinks in the coasts of Saudi Arabia
AB  - Vegetated coastal ecosystems along the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf coasts of Saudi Arabia thrive in an extremely arid and oligotrophic environment, with high seawater temperatures and salinity. Mangrove, seagrass and saltmarsh ecosystems have been shown to act as efficient sinks of sediment organic carbon, earning these vegetated ecosystems the moniker 'blue carbon' ecosystems. However, their role as nitrogen and phosphorus (N and P) sinks remains poorly understood. In this study, we examine the capacity of blue carbon ecosystems to trap and store nitrogen and phosphorous in their sediments in the central Red Sea and Arabian Gulf. We estimated the N and P stocks (in 0.2 m thick-sediments) and accumulation rates (for the last century based on 210Pb and for the last millennia based on 14C) in mangrove, seagrass and saltmarsh sediments from eight locations along the coast of Saudi Arabia (81 cores in total). The N and P stocks contained in the top 20 cm sediments ranged from 61 g N m-2 in Red Sea seagrass to 265 g N m-2 in the Gulf saltmarshes and from 70 g P m-2 in Red Sea seagrass meadows and mangroves to 58 g P m-2 in the Gulf saltmarshes. The short-term N and P accumulation rates ranged from 0.09 mg N cm-2 yr-1 in Red Sea seagrass to 0.38 mg N cm-2 yr-1 in Gulf mangrove, and from 0.027 mg P cm-2 yr-1 in the Gulf seagrass to 0.092 mg P cm-2 yr-1 in Red Sea mangroves. Short-term N and P accumulation rates were up to 10-fold higher than long-term accumulation rates, highlighting increasing sequestration of N and P over the past century, likely due to anthropogenic activities such as coastal development and wastewater inputs.

TI  - Communities and blue carbon: the role of traditional management systems in providing benefits for carbon storage, biodiversity conservation and livelihoods
AB  - Blue carbon refers to the considerable amounts of carbon sequestered by mangroves, seagrass beds, tidal marshes and other coastal and marine vegetated ecosystems. At the present time, carbon market mechanisms to compensate those conserving blue carbon ecosystems, and thus reducing carbon emissions, are not yet in place. The ecosystem services provided by coastal vegetated ecosystems extend beyond their carbon storage capacity, and include their contribution to fishery production; shoreline protection; provision of habitat for wildlife and migratory species; flood water attenuation; nutrient cycling, pollution buffering; as well as their cultural, spiritual, subsistence and recreational uses. Because these services are of high economic, social and cultural value, the management and protection of blue carbon ecosystems could build collaboration between climate change and biodiversity practitioners on the national and international level. Such collaboration would also allow for the transfer of lessons learned from coastal management and conservation activities to carbon mitigation projects, and would include the need to work closely together with indigenous peoples and local communities. Resulting management activities on the local level could utilize and strengthen traditional knowledge and management systems related to blue carbon ecosystems, and increase both the resilience of biodiversity and that of coastal communities, as well as provide for long-term storage of blue carbon. While the challenge of scaling up local initiatives remains, some concrete examples already exist, such as the network of locally-managed marine areas (LMMAs) in the Pacific and beyond.

TI  - Gulf of Mexico estuarine blue carbon stock, extent and flux: Mangroves, marshes, and seagrasses: A North American hotspot
AB  - The Gulf of Mexico blue carbon habitats (mangroves, seagrass, and salt marshes) form an important North American blue carbon hot spot. These habitats cover 2,161,446 ha and grow profusely in estuaries that occupy 38,000 km 2 to store substantial sedimentary organic carbon of 480.48 Tg C. New investigations around GoM for Mexican mangroves, Louisiana salt marshes and seagrasses motivated our integration of buried organic carbon to elucidate a new estimate of GoM blue carbon stocks. Factors creating this include: large GoM watersheds enriching carbon slowly flowing through shallow estuarine habitats with long residence times; fewer SE Mexican hurricanes allowing enhanced carbon storage; mangrove carbon productivity enhanced by warm southern basin winter temperatures; large Preservation reserves amongst high anthropogenic development. The dominant total GoM mangrove blue carbon stock 196.88 Tg from total mangrove extent 650,482 ha is highlighted from new Mexican data. Mexican mangrove organic carbon stock is 112.74 Tg (1st sediment meter) plus USA 84.14 Tg. Mexican mangroves vary greatly in storage, total carbon depositional depths and in sediment age (to 3500 y). We report Mexican mangrove's conservative storage fraction for the normally-compared top meter, whereas the full storage depth estimates ranging above 366.78 Tg (high productivity in very deep sediment along the central Veracruz/Tabasco coast) are not reflected in our reported estimates. Seagrasses stock of 184.1 Tg C organic is derived from 972,327 ha areal extent (in 1st meter). The Louisiana marshes form the heart of GoM salt marsh carbon storage 99.5 Tg (in 1st meter), followed by lesser stocks in Florida, Texas, finally Mexico derived from salt marsh extent totaling 650,482 ha.

TI  - Ocean Acidification Alleviates Dwarf Eelgrass (Zostera noltii) Lipid Landscape Remodeling under Warming Stress
AB  - Simple Summary Expected climate change scenarios will have inevitable and important impacts on key foundation marine species such as seagrasses. This study was aimed to understand how the dwarf eelgrass Zostera noltii leaf lipid landscapes are altered under predicted ocean warming (+4 degrees C) and acidification (Delta pH 0.4) conditions. A severe reduction in the leaf total fatty acid (FA) content was observed in seagrasses individually exposed to hypercapnic or warming conditions, and this depletion was ameliorated under combined exposure to ocean warming and acidification conditions. The tested treatments also impacted the FA composition of all lipid classes, with warming exposure leading to decreases in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Galactolipid remodeling seems to have key roles in the physiological changes observed in seagrasses under these tested conditions, highlighting the higher impact of warming and that the proposed stress alleviation effect induced by increased water-dissolved CO2 availability. Neutral lipids were substantially increased under warming conditions, mainly with increases in C18 FA, impairing their use as substrates to maintain the osmotic balance of the cells. Nonetheless, the pace at which ocean warming is occurring can overcome the ameliorative capacity induced by higher CO2 availability, leaving seagrasses under severe heat stress beyond their lipid-remodeling capacity. Coastal seagrass meadows provide a variety of essential ecological and economic services, including nursery grounds, sediment stabilization, nutrient cycling, coastal protection, and blue carbon sequestration. However, these ecosystems are highly threatened by ongoing climatic change. This study was aimed to understand how the dwarf eelgrass Zostera noltii leaf lipid landscapes are altered under predicted ocean warming (+4 degrees C) and hypercapnic (Delta pH 0.4) conditions. Warming and hypercapnic conditions were found to induce a severe reduction in the leaf total fatty acid, though the combined treatment substantially alleviated this depletion. The lipid discrimination revealed a significant increase in the relative monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) content in both hypercapnic and warming conditions, allied to plastidial membrane stabilization mechanisms. Hypercapnia also promoted enhanced phosphatidylglycerol (PG) leaf contents, a mechanism often associated with thylakoid reinvigoration. In addition to changing the proportion of storage, galacto- and phospholipids, the tested treatments also impacted the FA composition of all lipid classes, with warming exposure leading to decreases in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs); however, the combination of both stress conditions alleviated this effect. The observed galactolipid and phospholipid PUFA decreases are compatible with a homeoviscous adaptation, allowing for the maintenance of membrane stability by counteracting excessive membrane fluidity. Neutral lipid contents were substantially increased under warming conditions, especially in C18 fatty acids (C18), impairing their use as substrates for fatty acylated derivatives essential for maintaining the osmotic balance of cells. An analysis of the phospholipid and galactolipid fatty acid profiles as a whole revealed a higher degree of discrimination, highlighting the higher impact of warming and the proposed stress alleviation effect induced by increased water-dissolved CO2 availability. Still, it is essential to remember that the pace at which the ocean is warming can overcome the ameliorative capacity induced by higher CO2 availability, leaving seagrasses under severe heat stress beyond their lipid remodeling capacity.

TI  - Environmental drivers of sediment carbon storage in temperate seagrass meadows
AB  - Seagrass meadows are productive ecosystems that contribute to climate change mitigation by accumulating `Blue Carbon' in their plant biomass and sediments. However, there is wide variation in reported sediment carbon stocks (C-stocks) across different global regions and between meadows composed of different seagrass species. Therefore, understanding the drivers for sediment C-stocks variation is crucial to developing effective conservation and restoration projects for seagrass ecosystems. This study analyses the influence of environmental factors on the variation in sediment C-stocks for six intertidal seagrass meadows within the Solent region, in southern England. There were significant differences between sites for all variables, except leaf density, and concentrations of the sediment pore water nutrients. Sediment dry bulk density, mean grain size, sorting coefficient, \% mud, elevation above sea level, and pore water salinity showed high levels of association with C-stocks when assessed individually. Multivariate analyses showed that sediment dry bulk density, sorting coefficient, \% mud, and pore water pH and concentration of nutrients greatly influenced C-stock. Moreover, sediment characteristics acted in conjunction to explain most of the variation in C-stock among sites. Therefore, sediment characteristics should be considered as important indicators for carbon storage potential in intertidal temperate seagrass meadows.

TI  - CARBON OUTWELLING FROM A MANGROVE FOREST WITH ADJACENT SEAGRASS BEDS AND CORAL-REEFS (GAZI BAY, KENYA)
AB  - Carbon fluxes from a mangrove creek with adjacent seagrass meadows and coral reefs (at 4 km from the creek) were investigated in Gazi Bay (Kenya). Analysis of the stable isotope signature of sediment carbon in the seagrass zone and data on the sediment carbon content indicate that outwelling of particulate organic matter (POM) from the mangrove forest occurs, but that deposition of this POM rapidly decreases away from the forest. No evidence for any input of mangrove POM in the seagrass zone was found at a distance of 3 km from the mangrove creek, near the reefs. The gradient in sediment deltaC-13 values in the seagrass zone was paralleled by a similar gradient of deltaC-13 values in Thalassodendron ciliatum, the dominant subtidal seagrass. This gradient probably reflects the availability of respiratory CO2 derived from mangrove POM as a carbon source for the seagrass. Analysis of C:N ratios of particulate material (< 1 mm) collected with sediment traps in the seagrass zone yielded values ranging from 8.5 to 11.2. This range is remarkably low compared to C:N ratios of plant material produced in the mangrove forest, and suggests that some of the mangrove-derived organic particles deposited in the seagrass zone have gone through a phase of intensive processing. During flood tides conspicuous decreases were found in deltaC-13 values of seston flowing over the seagrass zone, coinciding with significant increases in the carbon content of the seston. These findings point to a reversed flux of organic particles from the seagrass zone to the mangrove forest. Our data indicate that, as far as POM fluxes are concerned, the mangrove forest and adjacent seagrass meadows are tightly coupled, but that the nearby coral reefs may exist in relative isolation.

TI  - Keys to successful blue carbon projects: Lessons learned from global case studies
AB  - Ecosystem services such as protection from storms and erosion, tourism benefits, and climate adaptation and mitigation have been increasingly recognized as important considerations for environmental policymalcing. Recent research has shown that coastal ecosystems such as seagrasses, salt marshes, and mangroves provide climate mitigation services because they are particularly effective at sequestering and storing carbon dioxide, referred to as ``coastal blue carbon{''}. Unfortunately, degradation of blue carbon ecosystems due to anthropogenic impacts contributes to anthropogenic carbon emissions from land use impacts and prevents these ecosystems from continuing to sequester and store carbon. Given the impressive carbon sequestration and storage in coastal ecosystems, many countries with blue carbon resources are beginning to implement blue carbon restoration projects using carbon financing mechanisms. This study analyzed four case studies of projects in Kenya, India, Vietnam, and Madagascar, evaluating the individual carbon financing mechanisms, the project outcomes, and the policy implications of each. Strengths and challenges of implementing blue carbon projects are discussed and considerations that all projects should address are examined in order to develop long-term sustainable climate mitigation or adaptation policies. This analysis can help to inform future project design considerations as well as policy opportunities. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Variability of UK seagrass sediment carbon: Implications for blue carbon estimates and marine conservation management
AB  - Seagrass meadows provide a multitude of ecosystem services, including a capacity to sequester carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) within their sediments. Seagrass research in the UK is lacking and there is no published data on sediment carbon (C) within UK seagrass meadows. We sampled 13 Zostera marina meadows along the southwest coast of the UK to assess the variability in their sedimentary organic carbon (OC) stocks. The study sites were considered representative of sub-tidal Z. marina meadows in the UK, spanning a gradient of sheltered to exposed sites, varying in formation, size and density, but found along the same latitudinal gradient. OC stocks (Cstocks) integrated across 100cm depth profiles were similar among all sites (98.01 Â± 2.15 to 140.24 Â± 10.27 Mg C ha -1 ), apart from at Drakes Island, which recorded an unusually high Cstock (380.07 Â± 17.51 Mg C ha -1 ) compared to the rest of the region. The total standing stock of C in the top 100cm of the surveyed seagrass meadows was 66,337 t C, or the equivalent of 10,512 individual UK people's CO2 emissions per year. This figure is particularly significant relative to the seagrass area, which totalled 549.79 ha. Using estimates of seagrass cover throughout the UK and recent UK C trading values we approximate that the monetary value of the UK's seagrass standing C stock is between Â£2.6 million and Â£5.3 million. The C stock of the UK's seagrass meadows represent one of the largest documented C stocks within Europe and are, therefore, of important ecosystem service value. The research raises questions concerning the reliability of using global or regional data as a proxy for local seagrass C stock estimates and adds to a growing body of literature that is looking to understand the mechanisms of seagrass C storage. When taken with the fact that seagrass meadows are an important habitat for commercially important and endangered species in the UK, along with their declining health and cover, this research supports the need for more robust conservation strategies for UK seagrass habitats.

TI  - Blue carbon in the Indian Ocean: a review and research agenda
AB  - The Indian Ocean is home to some of the most extensive coastal blue carbon ecosystems on the planet. Together, the nations within and surrounding this ocean basin contain approximately 50\% (an estimated 76,275 km(2)) of the world's mangrove forests and a large, but unknown, proportion of its seagrass meadows. The nations of the Indian Ocean have an opportunity to be world leaders in restoration and protection of these ecosystems, which can help mitigate climate change, enhance livelihoods and protect shorelines from erosion and storm damage. Already, Indian Ocean nations are showing leadership by acknowledging blue carbon ecosystems in their Nationally Determined Contributions, and by championing efforts to establish some of the largest blue carbon restoration projects globally. However, more can be done. We outline a research agenda that will pave the way for effective evidence-based policy in the Indian Ocean, by reducing uncertainty and providing the tools and knowledge needed.

TI  - Porewater Carbonate Chemistry Dynamics in a Temperate and a Subtropical Seagrass System
AB  - Seagrass systems are integral components of both local and global carbon cycles and can substantially modify seawater biogeochemistry, which has ecological ramifications. However, the influence of seagrass on porewater biogeochemistry has not been fully described, and the exact role of this marine macrophyte and associated microbial communities in the modification of porewater chemistry remains equivocal. In the present study, carbonate chemistry in the water column and porewater was investigated over diel timescales in contrasting, tidally influenced seagrass systems in Southern California and Bermuda, including vegetated (Zostera marina) and unvegetated biomes (0-16 cm) in Mission Bay, San Diego, USA and a vegetated system (Thallasia testudinium) in Mangrove Bay, Ferry Reach, Bermuda. In Mission Bay, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA) exhibited strong increasing gradients with sediment depth. Vertical porewater profiles differed between the sites, with almost twice as high concentrations of DIC and TA observed in the vegetated compared to the unvegetated sediments. In Mangrove Bay, both the range and vertical profiles of porewater carbonate parameters such as DIC and TA were much lower and, in contrast to Mission Bay where no distinct temporal signal was observed, biogeochemical parameters followed the semi-diurnal tidal signal in the water column. The observed differences between the study sites most likely reflect a differential influence of biological (biomass, detritus and infauna) and physical processes (e.g., sediment permeability, residence time and mixing) on porewater carbonate chemistry in the different settings.

TI  - Latitudinal Patterns in European Seagrass Carbon Reserves: Influence of Seasonal Fluctuations versus Short-Term Stress and Disturbance Events
AB  - Seagrass meadows form highly productive and valuable ecosystems in the marine environment. Throughout the year, seagrass meadows are exposed to abiotic and biotic variations linked to (i) seasonal fluctuations, (ii) short-term stress events such as, e.g., local nutrient enrichment, and (iii) small-scale disturbances such as, e.g., biomass removal by grazing. We hypothesized that short-term stress events and small-scale disturbances may affect seagrass chance for survival in temperate latitudes. To test this hypothesis we focused on seagrass carbon reserves in the form of starch stored seasonally in rhizomes, as these have been defined as a good indicator for winter survival. Twelve Zostera noltei meadows were monitored along a latitudinal gradient in Western Europe to firstly assess the seasonal change of their rhizomal starch content. Secondly, we tested the effects of nutrient enrichment and/or biomass removal on the corresponding starch content by using a short-term manipulative field experiment at a single latitude in the Netherlands. At the end of the growing season, we observed a weak but significant linear increase of starch content along the latitudinal gradient from south to north. This agrees with the contention that such reserves are essential for regrowth after winter, which is more severe in the north. In addition, we also observed a weak but significant positive relationship between starch content at the beginning of the growing season and past winter temperatures. This implies a lower regrowth potential after severe winters, due to diminished starch content at the beginning of the growing season. Short-term stress and disturbances may intensify these patterns, because our manipulative experiments show that when nutrient enrichment and biomass loss co-occurred at the end of the growing season, Z. noltei starch content declined. In temperate zones, the capacity of seagrasses to accumulate carbon reserves is expected to determine carbon-based regrowth after winter. Therefore, processes affecting those reserves might affect seagrass resilience. With increasing human pressure on coastal systems, short- and small-scale stress events are expected to become more frequent, threatening the resilience of seagrass ecosystems, particularly at higher latitudes, where populations tend to have an annual cycle highly dependent on their storage capacity.

TI  - The effects of long-term in situ CO2 enrichment on tropical seagrass communities at volcanic vents
AB  - The effects of long-term exposure to elevated levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) on seagrass communities are still poorly understood. This study investigates the tropical subtidal seagrass communities at three shallow volcanic CO2 vents in Papua New Guinea. Seagrass cover and biomass increased threefold and fivefold, respectively, from control to medium and high pCO(2) sites (average pH = 7.9, 7.7, and 7.5, respectively). The seagrass community composition differed significantly between the pCO(2) sites: Cymodocea serrulata, Cymodocea rotundata, and Halodule uninervis were more abundant at high pCO(2) sites, whereas Halophila ovalis, Thalassia hemprichii, and Syringodium isoetifolium occurred only at low and mid pCO(2) sites. Cymodocea rotundata was the only species common among all pCO(2) sites and locations. The delta C-13 in its leaves significantly declined with increasing pCO(2), indicating that additional CO2 influenced seagrass carbon uptake, and specifically, that there was discrimination against the heavier isotope (C-13) when carbon was more abundant. Size-specific leaf growth rates (i.e. leaf turnover) also significantly declined with increasing pCO(2); however, leaf growth rates showed no consistent difference in response to elevated pCO(2) in two of four surveys. Our study suggests that progressive ocean acidification may lead to higher cover and above- and below-ground biomass, but lower size-specific growth and altered species composition in tropical seagrass communities. The effects of co-limiting factors, such as light and nutrient availability, on early-responding parameters, such as growth rates, require further attention to improve projections.

TI  - How organic carbon derived from multiple sources contributes to carbon sequestration processes in a shallow coastal system?
AB  - Carbon captured by marine organisms helps sequester atmospheric CO2, especially in shallow coastal ecosystems, where rates of primary production and burial of organic carbon (OC) from multiple sources are high. However, linkages between the dynamics of OC derived from multiple sources and carbon sequestration are poorly understood. We investigated the origin (terrestrial, phytobenthos derived, and phytoplankton derived) of particulate OC (POC) and dissolved OC (DOC) in the water column and sedimentary OC using elemental, isotopic, and optical signatures in Furen Lagoon, Japan. Based on these data analysis, we explored how OC from multiple sources contributes to sequestration via storage in sediments, water column sequestration, and air-sea CO2 exchanges, and analyzed how the contributions vary with salinity in a shallow seagrass meadow as well. The relative contribution of terrestrial POC in the water column decreased with increasing salinity, whereas autochthonous POC increased in the salinity range 10-30. Phytoplankton-derived POC dominated the water column POC (65-95\%) within this salinity range; however, it was minor in the sediments (3-29\%). In contrast, terrestrial and phytobenthos-derived POC were relatively minor contributors in the water column but were major contributors in the sediments (49-78\% and 19-36\%, respectively), indicating that terrestrial and phytobenthos-derived POC were selectively stored in the sediments. Autochthonous DOC, part of which can contribute to long-term carbon sequestration in the water column, accounted for >25\% of the total water column DOC pool in the salinity range 15-30. Autochthonous OC production decreased the concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon in the water column and thereby contributed to atmospheric CO2 uptake, except in the low-salinity zone. Our results indicate that shallow coastal ecosystems function not only as transition zones between land and ocean but also as carbon sequestration filters. They function at different timescales, depending on the salinity, and OC sources.

TI  - Response of Posidonia oceanica seagrass and its epibiont communities to ocean acidification
AB  - The unprecedented rate of CO2 increase in our atmosphere and subsequent ocean acidification (OA) threatens coastal ecosystems. To forecast the functioning of coastal seagrass ecosystems in acidified oceans, more knowledge on the long-term adaptive capacities of seagrass species and their epibionts is needed. Therefore we studied morphological characteristics of Posidonia oceanica and the structure of its epibiont communities at a Mediterranean volcanic CO2 vent off Panarea Island (Italy) and performed a laboratory experiment to test the effect of OA on P. oceanica photosynthesis and its potential buffering capacity. At the study site east of Basiluzzo Islet, venting of CO2 gas was controlled by tides, resulting in an average pH difference of 0.1 between the vent and reference site. P. oceanica shoot and leaf density was unaffected by these levels of OA, although shorter leaves at the vent site suggest increased susceptibility to erosion, potentially by herbivores. The community of sessile epibionts differed in composition and was characterized by a higher species richness at the vent site, though net epiphytic calcium carbonate concentration was similar. These findings suggest a higher ecosystem complexity at the vent site, which may have facilitated the higher diversity of copepods in the otherwise unaffected motile epibiont community. In the laboratory experiment, P. oceanica photosynthesis increased with decreasing pH(T) (7.6, 6.6, 5.5), which induced an elevated pH at the leaf surfaces of up to 0.5 units compared to the ambient seawater pH(T) of 6.6. This suggests a temporary pH buffering in the diffusive boundary layer of leaves, which could be favorable for epibiont organisms. The results of this multispecies study contribute to understanding community-level responses and underlying processes in long-term acidified conditions. Increased replication and monitoring of physico-chemical parameters on an annual scale are, however, recommended to assure that the biological responses observed during a short period reflect long-term dynamics of these parameters.

TI  - A marine heatwave drives massive losses from the world's largest seagrass carbon stocks
AB  - Seagrass ecosystems contain globally significant organic carbon (C) stocks. However, climate change and increasing frequency of extreme events threaten their preservation. Shark Bay, Western Australia, has the largest C stock reported for a seagrass ecosystem, containing up to 1.3\% of the total C stored within the top metre of seagrass sediments worldwide. On the basis of field studies and satellite imagery, we estimate that 36\% of Shark Bay's seagrass meadows were damaged following a marine heatwave in 2010/2011. Assuming that 10 to 50\% of the seagrass sediment C stock was exposed to oxic conditions after disturbance, between 2 and 9 Tg CO2 could have been released to the atmosphere during the following three years, increasing emissions from land-use change in Australia by 4-21\% per annum. With heatwaves predicted to increase with further climate warming, conservation of seagrass ecosystems is essential to avoid adverse feedbacks on the climate system.

TI  - The super typhoon Lekima (2019) resulted in massive losses in large seagrass (Zostera japonica) meadows, soil organic carbon and nitrogen pools in the intertidal Yellow River Delta, China
AB  - Seagrass meadows are key ecosystems, and they are among the most threatened habitats on the planet. Increased numbers of extreme climate events, such as hurricanes and marine heatwaves have caused severe damage to global seagrass meadows. The largest Zostera japonica meadows in China are located in the Yellow River Delta. It had a distribution area of 1031.8 ha prior to August 2019 when the Yellow River Delta was severely impacted by the passage of typhoon Lekima. In this study, we compared field data collected before and after the typhoon to determine its impact on seagrass beds in the Yellow River Delta. The super typhoon caused dramatic changes in Z. japonica in the Yellow River Delta, resulting in a greater than 100-fold decrease in distribution area, a greater than 35\% loss of soil organic carbon, and a greater than 65\% loss of soil total nitrogen in the top 35 cm sediments. Owing to the lack of seeds and overwintering shoots, as well as the small remaining distribution area, recovery was impossible, even though environmental factors were still suitable for species growth. Thus, restoration efforts are required for seagrass meadow recovery. Additionally, the long-term monitoring of this meadow will provide new information on the ecosystem's status and will be useful for future protection. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A blue carbon ecosystems qualitative assessment applying the DPSIR framework: Local perspective of global benefits and contributions
AB  - Mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes or collectively known as blue carbon ecosystems are gaining salience because of their essential roles in reducing the risks and impacts of climate change through carbon sequestration and other beneficial services. Despite this, they are globally declining because of their vulnerability to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Similar trends are also observed in Busuanga Island, Palawan province in the Philippines, where blue carbon ecosystems along with other coastal environments are perceived to be threatened by a number of factors. To better understand the state changes of blue carbon ecosystems, we collected the drivers and pressures and their impact on the whole coastal ecosystem as well as existing management responses by interviewing 26 stakeholders representing community organizations, non-government organizations, and municipal level government units from two municipalities (Busuanga and Coron) in the island. We used the Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework to analyze the information gathered from the interviews. The results of this study show that lack of institutional capacities (indirect driver) is the leading factor that hinders the progress or efficacy of the management. Most pronounced pressures caused by direct drivers to blue carbon ecosystems include overexploitation and coastal developments. The responses collected in the interviews can be grouped into policies and implementation, capacity building development, welfare and livelihood development, ecosystems management, and tourism measures. The information gathered in this study can be used to improve or change existing responses into more precise and contextualized measures in addressing specific impacts observed in the local areas.

TI  - Aspects of environmental impacts of seawater desalination: Cyprus as a case study
AB  - Cyprus relies on seawater desalination for a large part of its drinking water supply, with reverse osmosis providing more than 95\% of the total desalination capacity in the country. Nevertheless, the environmental impacts of desalination for the Cypriot environment remain poorly understood. Using a combination of mining existing governmental and corporate survey data and reports, this study explores the scale of desalination in Cyprus, the impacts on the coastal marine environment and its overall carbon footprint. Surveys of Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadows show strongly reduced density of shoots and leaf surface area, respectively. Analysis of the available data relating to the overall production of desalinated water and energy consumption reveals that 68.7 million m(3) of desalinated water were produced in Cyprus in 2017, resulting in the release of 160 ktons of CO2 equivalent, representing around 2\% of the total carbon emissions in Cyprus. The results are directly applicable for understanding the impacts of brine discharge on seagrass meadows, one of the most common types of Mediterranean seabed ecosystems and useful for providing guidance to decision makers as they are striving to achieve a zero-carbon economy. strategies for achieving greater sustainability in terms of reduced CO2 emissions and less brine discharge are discussed.

TI  - Seagrass beds store less carbon but support more macrobenthos than mangrove forests
AB  - Seagrass beds (SG) have powerful ecosystem functions, but some seagrasses, e.g., Halophila beccarii, have been neglected because of their tiny plant structure and narrow and restricted distribution in the intertidal zone. In this study, we compared ecosystem structure and function between H. beccarii SG and adjacent coastal habitats through: (i) vegetation composition, (ii) carbon storage, and (iii) macrobenthic community. The vegetation carbon storage was only 0.1\% of that in mangrove forests (MG). The sediment carbon storage (0-60 cm) of SG (67.4 +/- 20.2 MgCorg.ha(-1)) was 74.31\% of MG (90.7 +/- 12.9 MgCorg.ha(-1)) and 13.51\% higher than unvegetated flats (UnV) (55.1 +/- 17.7 MgCorg.ha(-1)). The macrobenthic abundance, biomass and secondary productivity in SG were significantly higher than those in MG, indicating that SG support more macrobenthos than MG. However, SG experienced more disturbances than MG and UnV. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the protection of H. beccarii SG to preserve their essential functions and services.

TI  - Earth observation for ecosystem accounting: spatially explicit national seagrass extent and carbon stock in Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and Madagascar
AB  - Seagrass ecosystems are globally significant hot spots of blue carbon storage, coastal biodiversity and coastal protection, rendering them a so-called natural climate solution. Their potential as a natural climate solution has been largely overlooked in national and international climate strategies and financing. This stems mainly from the lack of standardized, spatially explicit mapping and region-specific carbon inventories. Here, we introduce a novel seagrass ecosystem accounting framework that harnesses machine learning, big satellite data analytics and open region-specific reference data within the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. Leveraging a biennial percentile composite, assembled from 16 453 Sentinel-2 surface reflectance image tiles at 10-m spatial resolution, and 20 820 reference data points, we applied the cloud-native framework to produce the first national inventories of seagrass extent and total seagrass carbon stocks in Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and Madagascar. We estimated 4316 km(2) of regional seagrass extent (mean F1-score of 59.3\% and overall accuracy of 84.3\%) up to 23 m of depth. Pairing country-specific in situ carbon data and our spatially explicit seagrass extents, we calculated total regional seagrass blue carbon stocks between 11.2-40.2 million MgC, with the largest national carbon pool in Kenya (8-29.2 million MgC). We envisage that improvements in the remote sensing components of the framework guided by a necessary influx of region-specific data on seagrass stocks and fluxes could reduce uncertainties in our current spatially explicit ecosystem extent and carbon accounts, enhancing the incorporation of seagrasses into Multilateral Environmental Agreements for future resilient ecosystems, societies and economies.

TI  - Challenges to select suitable habitats and demonstrate â€˜additionalityâ€™ in Blue Carbon projects: A seagrass case study
AB  - Seagrass restoration has been suggested as a Blue Carbon (BC) strategy for climate change mitigation. For Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) and carbon crediting schemes, BC projects need to demonstrate â€˜additionalityâ€™, that is enhanced CO2 sequestration and/or avoided greenhouse gas emissions following management actions. This typically requires determining soil carbon accumulation rates (CAR), which is often done using radionuclides or surface elevation tables to estimate sedimentation rates. Here we undertook a case study, using 210Pb and 14C dating, to detect possible changes in Corg stocks and CAR following the loss and partial recovery of Posidonia seagrass meadows in South Australia since 1980â€“90s. The 210Pb data revealed a lack of accumulation of excess 210Pb in most sites, suggesting negligible accumulation of sediments, intense mixing of the upper layers, or accumulation of reworked sediments, precluding the estimation of reliable CAR at decadal time scales. This limitation was also encountered with 14C. The inability to compare sites over analogous periods of time prevented quantifying differences in soil Corg sequestration, thereby to demonstrate additionality. The lack of significant differences in soil Corg stocks among sites which never suffered seagrass loss, those showing recovery and those with no recovery (5.7 Â± 1.2, 4.5 Â± 0.7 and 3.3 Â± 0.3 kg Corg m-2 within the top meter, respectively) also precluded estimates of soil Corg gains or losses. Our findings demonstrate that, while 210Pb and 14C provide important information on sediment deposition dynamics, it is not straightforward to demonstrate additionality using radionuclides in low depositional seagrass habitats exposed to hydrodynamic energy, features which may be encountered in seagrass sites. We provide insights for the selection of suitable habitats for seagrass BC projects, suggest possible alternative methods for estimating additionality, and discuss the implications of the findings for the implementation of seagrass BC strategies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Seagrass sediments as a global carbon sink: Isotopic constraints
AB  - Seagrass meadows are highly productive habitats found along many of the world's coastline, providing important services that support the overall functioning of the coastal zone. The organic carbon that accumulates in seagrass meadows is derived not only from seagrass production but from the trapping of other particles, as the seagrass canopies facilitate sedimentation and reduce resuspension. Here we provide a comprehensive synthesis of the available data to obtain a better understanding of the relative contribution of seagrass and other possible sources of organic matter that accumulate in the sediments of seagrass meadows. The data set includes 219 paired analyses of the carbon isotopic composition of seagrass leaves and sediments from 207 seagrass sites at 88 locations worldwide. Using a three source mixing model and literature values for putative sources, we calculate that the average proportional contribution of seagrass to the surface sediment organic carbon pool is similar to 50\%. When using the best available estimates of carbon burial rates in seagrass meadows, our data indicate that between 41 and 66 gC m(-2) yr(-1) originates from seagrass production. Using our global average for allochthonous carbon trapped in seagrass sediments together with a recent estimate of global average net community production, we estimate that carbon burial in seagrass meadows is between 48 and 112 Tg yr(-1), showing that seagrass meadows are natural hot spots for carbon sequestration.

TI  - Natural seagrass tribopositive material based spray coatable triboelectric nanogenerator
AB  - For the first time, this paper proposes natural seagrass based prominent ocean flowering and bio-friendly material for triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) through a simple spray coating technique. Herein, two different seagrass species (Zostera marina and Phyllospadix japonicus) are effectively applied as a tribopositive material. Furthermore, spray coatable Phyllospadix japonicus seagrass film/PET TENG yields a higher power density of 70.42 mu W/cm2 compared to Zostera marina seagrass film/PET TENG of 50.42 mu W/cm2 because of the higher oxygen functional groups, which enables the device to offer increased electron-donating capability. Moreover, the output performance of the proposed spray coatable TENG device improved by about 31\% compared to powder-based seagrass film. Furthermore, the Phyllospadix japonicus based TENG presents the extraordinary working stability up to 72,000 cycles (2 h), which confirms the excellent robustness of the fabricated device. It is further demonstrated that the proposed Phyllospadix japonicus based TENG can easily charge various commercial capacitors and capable of driving about 150 light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and other microelectronic devices. We anticipate that by applying seagrass as a tribopositive layer, the proposed spray coatable TENG device will serve its promising role for energy generation with extremely low fabrication cost. Furthermore, in addition to the economic use of seagrass as a TENG, this work can favorably contribute to sustainable seagrass management.

TI  - CO2 sequestration and fate of organic matters within seagrass (Zostera marina) ecosystem
AB  - The purpose of our current study was to clear the fate of organic carbon and nitrogen in seawater and sediment, especially the difference between organic carbon and nitrogen in dissolved and particulate forms and to determine carbon sequestration by seagrass ecosystem. We had carried out four types experiments: the diel variation for 24 hour, and seasonal changes of DOC (Dissolved Organic Carbon)/DON (Dissolved Organic Nitrogen) and POC (Particulate Organic Carbon)/PON (Particulate Organic Nitrogen) in outside and inside of seagrass communities, and the enclosed chamber experiment for evaluation of release of organic matters from seagrass exuadation and the sediment, decomposition experiments in laboratory and in situ. POM (Particulate Organic Matter) of seagrass leaf litter is resistance to the biological degradation under 25degreesC. (The rate constant of decomposition is 0.0083 d(-1), namely remineralization time is about 120 days.) While POM in water column shows POC is more rapidly consumed to PON, and POC/PON ratio decresed with time of decomposition. DOM in water column shows DON is more rapidly consumed to DOC and DOC/DON ratio increased with time of decomposition. This suggests that rate of solubilization of DON from PON may dominate a rate of remineralization of nutrients in seagrass communities. We developed a kinetic model of the seagrass decomposition process (SDP) changes in POC/PON ratio with time as well as phytoplankton decomposition model (Fujii et al., 2002). The SDP model was adapted to the results of three kinds of decomposition experiments where the initial C/N ratio and the volume ratio of POM and DOM differed by more than a factor of three. The apparent zeroth-order decrease in POC and the constant PON in the first labile decomposition process are well expressed by the SD model, and consequently, the calculated POC/PON ratio shows good agreement with the experimental result. A realistic model for CO2 sequestration was also developed using net organic production (net organic production=gross organic production-respiration), sedimentation inside seagrass bed and sedimentation at the open ocean (=export flux). We calculated net sequestration of carbon into deep water after 100 years under two different sinking velocities which are for 6 m.d(-1) and 24 m.d(-1). These results showed that 120 t-C for 6 m.d(-1) and 150 t-C for 24 m.d(-1) during 100 years were accumulated into deepwater, suggesting that 1.2 to 1.5 t-C-year(-1) for 31 t-C of gross production of seagrass km(-2) are accumulating into deep water. Seagrass ecosystem is very effective as one of the CO2 sequestration.

TI  - Reply to Oreska et al 'Comment on Geoengineering with seagrasses: Is credit due where credit is given?'
AB  - In their comment on the review paper, 'Geoengineering with seagrasses: is credit due where credit is given?,' Oreska et al 2018 state that some of the concerns raised in the review 'warrant serious consideration by the seagrass research community,' but they argue that these concerns are either not relevant to the Voluntary Carbon Standard protocol, VM0033, or are already addressed by specific provisions in the protocol. The VM0033 protocol is a strong and detailed document that includes much of merit, but the methodology for determining carbon sequestration in sediment is flawed, both in the carbon stock change method and in the carbon burial method. The main problem with the carbon stock change method is that the labile carbon in the surface layer of sediments is vulnerable to remineralization and resuspension; it is not sequestered on the 100 year timescale required for carbon credits. The problem with the carbon burial method is chiefly in its application. The protocol does not explain how to apply 210Pb-dating to a core, leaving project proponents to apply the inappropriate methods frequently reported in the blue carbon literature, which result in overestimated sediment accumulation rates. Finally, the default emission factors permitted by the protocol are based on literature values that are themselves too high. All of these problems can be addressed, which should result in clearer, more rigorous guidelines for awarding carbon credits for the protection or restoration of seagrass meadows.

TI  - Megaherbivore exclusion led to more complex seagrass canopies and increased biomass and sediment C-org pools in a tropical meadow
AB  - In some regions of the Caribbean Sea, seagrasses have been negatively affected by sea turtle overgrazing. Seagrass canopy complexity has declined at a long-term monitoring site in Costa Rica. We deployed megaherbivore exclosures for 13 months and found an increase over time in seagrass cover and maximum canopy height to similar to 75\% and 20 cm respectively in the exclosures; while they remained steady in controls at < 25\% and similar to 5 cm. Following exclusion, above ground biomass was higher in exclosures (320 +/- 58 g DW m(-2)) compared to controls (171 +/- 60 g DW m(-2)). Leaves were longer and wider in the exclosures (8 +/- 5 cm and 0.8 +/- 0.2 cm) compared to controls (2 +/- 2 cm and 0.5 +/- 0.1 cm). Above ground biomass C(org )pools in exclosures (1.2 +/- 0.2 Mg ha(-1)) were two-times higher than in controls (0.6 +/- 0.2 Mg ha(-1)). Meanwhile, there was no variation between treatments in seagrass shoot density (1,692 +/- 803 shoots m(-2)), below ground biomass (246 +/- 103 g DW m(-2)) and its C-org pool (0.8 +/- 0.4 Mg ha(-1)). Relative sediment level increased up to 4.4 cm within exclosures revealing a net increase in sediment C-org, while surficial sediment C-org percentage was similar between exclosures and controls. Releasing these meadows from megaherbivore grazing therefore led to a clear increase within exclosures of seagrass cover, canopy complexity, above ground biomass, and C-org pools in above ground biomass and sediment. Our study reveals that the decline in canopy complexity over time at this meadow is linked to megaherbivore grazing and has most likely led to a decrease in blue carbon pools. Excessive megaherbivore grazing at this site could lead to a continued decline or potential loss of the meadow, and seagrass conservation and restoration initiatives should include consideration of trophic dynamics.

TI  - Metabolic Profiling Reveals Biochemical Pathways Responsible for Eelgrass Response to Elevated CO2 and Temperature
AB  - As CO2 levels in Earth's atmosphere and oceans steadily rise, varying organismal responses may produce ecological losers and winners. Increased ocean CO2 can enhance seagrass productivity and thermal tolerance, providing some compensation for climate warming. However, the metabolic shifts driving the positive response to elevated CO2 by these important ecosystem engineers remain unknown. We analyzed whole-plant performance and metabolic profiles of two geographically distinct eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) populations in response to CO2 enrichment. In addition to enhancing overall plant size, growth and survival, CO2 enrichment increased the abundance of Calvin Cycle and nitrogen assimilation metabolites while suppressing the abundance of stress-related metabolites. Overall metabolome differences between populations suggest that some eelgrass phenotypes may be better suited than others to cope with an increasingly hot and sour sea. Our results suggest that seagrass populations will respond variably, but overall positively, to increasing CO2 concentrations, generating negative feedbacks to climate change.

TI  - The Evolution of Blue Carbon Science
AB  - `Blue carbon' was coined over a decade ago to describe the contribution of mangroves, seagrasses, and tidal marshes to carbon drawdown in coasts and oceans, concomitantly attracting attention of policy-makers and resource managers to their potential as a natural climate solution. Here, we explore the emergence and evolution of this relatively new research field through bibliometrics approaches to investigate patterns and trends in scientific publications through time. Our aim was to understand the evolution of blue carbon science, from where we came from and where we are now. We analysed 1,729 papers from 5,763 authors. Overall, the carbon-sink capacity of these ecosystems has been recognised long before the term `blue carbon' was coined; with an annual percentage growth rate of 20\% y(-1). Research attention was highest for mangroves (similar to 38\% of publications), followed by saltmarshes (similar to 22\%), and seagrasses (similar to 18\%); while similar to 16\% of the studies included two or more blue carbon ecosystems and 5\% of the studies focused on other ecosystems. The citation burst analysis showed that, in the 1990s, the hot topic (i.e., fast-growing topic) was related to the overall flux and dynamics of carbon, with a recent transition to the role of coastal vegetation to climate change mitigation from 2009. The term `blue carbon' became a hot topic in 2017, with the strongest citation burst between 2017 and 2020. This bibliometric study draws the patterns and trends of blue carbon science and indicate that this field is evolving through time to focus more on the blue carbon role as nature climate solutions.

TI  - Photosynthetic response to globally increasing CO2 of co-occurring temperate seagrass species
AB  - Photosynthesis of most seagrass species seems to be limited by present concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Therefore, the ongoing increase in atmospheric CO2 could enhance seagrass photosynthesis and internal O2 supply, and potentially change species competition through differential responses to increasing CO2 availability among species. We used short-term photosynthetic responses of nine seagrass species from the south-west of Australia to test species-specific responses to enhanced CO2 and changes in HCO3-. Net photosynthesis of all species except Zostera polychlamys were limited at pre-industrial compared to saturating CO2 levels at light saturation, suggesting that enhanced CO2 availability will enhance seagrass performance. Seven out of the nine species were efficient HCO3- users through acidification of diffusive boundary layers, production of extracellular carbonic anhydrase, or uptake and internal conversion of HCO3-. Species responded differently to near saturating CO2 implying that increasing atmospheric CO2 may change competition among seagrass species if co-occurring in mixed beds. Increasing CO2 availability also enhanced internal aeration in the one species assessed. We expect that future increases in atmospheric CO2 will have the strongest impact on seagrass recruits and sparsely vegetated beds, because densely vegetated seagrass beds are most often limited by light and not by inorganic carbon.

TI  - High Seasonal Variability in Sediment Carbon Stocks of Cold-Temperate Seagrass Meadows
AB  - Seagrass meadows have a high ability to capture and store atmospheric CO2 in the plant biomass and underlying sediment and thereby function as efficient carbon sinks. The seagrass Zostera marina is a common species in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, a region with strong seasonal variations in climate. How seasonality affects carbon storage capacity in seagrass meadows is largely unknown, and therefore, in this study, we aimed to assess variations in sedimentary total organic carbon (TOC) content over a 1-year cycle in seagrass meadows on the Swedish west coast. The TOC was measured in two Z. marina sites, one wave exposed and one sheltered, and at two depths (1.5 and 4 m) within each site, every second month from August 2015 to June 2016. We found a strong seasonal variation in carbon density, with a peak in early summer (June), and that the TOC was negatively correlated to the net community production of the meadows, presumably related to organic matter degradation. There was seasonal variation in TOC content at all sediment sections, indicating that the carbon content down to 30 cm is unstable on a seasonal scale and therefore likely not a long-term carbon sink. The yearly mean carbon stocks were substantially higher in the sheltered meadow (3,965 and 3,465 g mâˆ’2) compared to the exposed one (2,712 and 1,054 g mâˆ’2) with similar seasonal variation. Due to the large intra-annual variability in TOC content, seasonal variation should be considered in carbon stock assessments and management for cold-temperate seagrass meadows. Â©2020.

TI  - Assessment of Carbon Sequestration in Posidonia Meadow
AB  - The coastal vegetation, in particular the seagrasses, plays a major role in the fixation of carbon. Posidonia oceanica, a species endemic to the Mediterranean Sea, is of particular interest because of the constitution of a particular structure, the matte, which enables the sequestration of carbon over long periods of time (carbon sink). This significant long-term carbon stock, accumulated by the Posidonia oceanica ecosystem, is of great interest with regard to the mitigation of global climate change. An initial assessment of the stocks of carbon sequestrated within the matte has been undertaken in two sectors of the NATURA 2000 site, Grand Herbier de la Plaine Orientale (Corsica, North-Western Mediterranean). The surface area of the meadow has been measured by means of the combined use of aerial remote sensing (shallow zone) and side-scan sonar (deep zone). The thickness of the matte has been assessed by means of seismic reflection using a 2.5 KHz sediment probe and a sparker. The calibration of the seismic data was performed by scuba diving at the level of intermatte cliffs, clearly visible on the seismic profiles. The seagrass meadow at the NATURA 2000 site extends from 3 to 41 m depth and covers an estimated total area of 22 667 ha, or 52.4\% of the bottom between 0 and 50 m depth. The speed of propagation within the matte (celerity), estimated by comparison of the field data (intermatte) and the seismic profiles, generally ranges from 1 600 to 1 700 m.s(-1). The thickness of the matte, estimated on the basis of the mean celerity, is on average 2.7 m for the northern sector (Biguglia) where it may locally exceed 8 m; it is on average 3.2 m for the southern sector (Aleria) where it may exceed 13 m, in particular off the mouth of a coastal lagoon (Diana). The presence of matte beneath the sediment should also be noted in patches of sand within the meadow and also beyond the lower limit. The quantity of carbon sequestered at this NATURA 2000 site may exceed 60 million tons. However, it would be necessary to determine the thickness of the matte for the whole site and to carry out coring within the matte, in several representative sectors, in order to assess more accurately the amounts of carbon sequestered.

TI  - A Re-evaluation of Wetland Carbon Sink Mitigation Concepts and Measurements: A Diagenetic Solution
AB  - The capacity of wetlands to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is the sum of two services: the protection of vulnerable organic stocks from remineralisation, and the capacity to sequester GHGs relative to their anthropogenic replacements. Organic carbon accumulation (CA) down through the sediment column is often taken as the measure of sequestration because of its capacity to record long-term variability and trends. However, we demonstrate that: i) CA is not equivalent to sequestration as net ecosystem production (NEP) for open systems; it requires the subtraction of the initial deposition rate of labile allochthonous carbon sources; ii) CA also requires subtraction of intrinsically allochthonous recalcitrants down through the sediment column, and together with subtraction of autochthonous recalcitrants from organic stock services; iii) CA as a climatic mitigation service also requires a diagenetic correction, as the annual deposition of labile organic carbon continues to remineralise over the long-term; and iv) preserving of a wetland has a significantly greater mitigation potential than restoring one. To address the above concerns, a global diagenetic solution is proposed, applied and tested for a tropical seagrass and mangrove. As expected, traditional CA estimates were disproportionately larger than their respective diagenetically modelled NEPs, and together with stocks fell within the ranges reported in the literature, with a final carbon accreditation highly dependent on the choice of their anthropogenic replacements. The review demonstrates that mitigation concepts and measurements for natural carbon sequestration solutions require re-evaluation to avoid GHG emissions above their capacity or reduce the ability to fulfil emission targets.

TI  - Beyond burial: Lateral exchange is a significant atmospheric carbon sink in mangrove forests
AB  - The blue carbon paradigm has evolved in recognition of the high carbon storage and sequestration potential of mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass ecosystems. However, fluxes of the potent greenhouse gases CH4 and N2O, and lateral export of carbon are often overlooked within the blue carbon framework. Here, we show that the export of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and alkalinity is approximately 1.7 times higher than burial as a long-term carbon sink in a subtropical mangrove system. Fluxes of methane offset burial by approximately 6%, while the nitrous oxide sink was approximately 0.5% of burial. Export of dissolved organic carbon and particulate organic carbon to the coastal zone is also significant and combined may account for an atmospheric carbon sink similar to burial. Our results indicate that the export of DIC and alkalinity results in a long-term atmospheric carbon sink and should be incorporated into the blue carbon paradigm when assessing the role of these habitats in sequestering carbon and mitigating climate change.

TI  - Geophysical constraints for organic carbon sequestration capacity of Zostera marina seagrass meadows and surrounding habitats
AB  - To elucidate the factors determining the organic carbon (OC) sequestration capacity of seagrass meadows, the distribution of OC and the fraction of seagrass-derived OC in sediments of the temperate cosmopolitan seagrass Zostera marina meadows and surrounding habitats were investigated in relation to physical properties of sedimentary materials. On average, seagrass meadow sediments showed OC levels twofold higher than other shallow nearshore habitats. However, offshore sediments often showed greater OC concentrations than average seagrass meadow sediments. According to estimations of OC sources based on carbon isotope ratios, 8-55\% and 14-24\% of OC in nonestuarine seagrass meadow sediments and < 30 m deep offshore sediments, respectively, were assigned to seagrass origin. The OC concentration in seagrass meadow and offshore sediments closely correlated to the specific surface area (SSA) of sediment (r(2) = 0.816 and 0.755, respectively; p< 0.0001), with an average OC loading per sediment surface area of approximately 60 mu mol m(-2). In seagrass meadow sediments, the fraction of seagrass- derived OC was also greater in samples with a larger SSA, and the seagrass-derived OC occurred preferentially in sediment grains that had a specific gravity exceeding 2.0, namely, in a form closely associated with sediment minerals. The OC concentration, the fraction of seagrass- derived OC, and the SSA were positively correlated to the logarithm of areal extent of individual seagrass meadows (p< 0.01). These findings suggest that the OC sequestration capacity of nearshore vegetated habitats is under the primary control of geophysical constraints such as sediment supply rate and depositional conditions.

TI  - Modelling blue carbon farming opportunities at different spatial scales
AB  - There is a growing interest in including blue carbon ecosystems (i.e., mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses) in climate mitigation programs in national and sub-national policies, with restoration and conservation of these ecosystems identified as potential activities to increase carbon accumulation through time. However, there is still a gap on the spatial scales needed to produce carbon offsets comparable with terrestrial or agricultural ecosystems. Here, we used the Coastal Blue Carbon InVEST 3.7.0 model to estimate future net carbon sequestration in blue carbon ecosystems along Australia's Great Barrier Reef (hereafter GBR) catchments, considering different management scenarios (i.e., reintroduction of tidal exchange through the removal of barriers, sea level rise, restoring low lying land) at three different spatial scales: whole GBR coastline, regional (14,000-16,300 ha), and local (335-370 ha) scales. The focus of the restoration (i.e., tidal marshes and/or mangroves) was dependent on data availability for each scenario. Furthermore, we also estimated the monetary value of carbon sequestration under each management scenario and spatial scale assessed in the study. We found that large scale restoration of tidal marshes could potentially sequester an additional similar to 800,000 tonnes of CO(2)e by 2045 (potentially generating AU\$12 million based on the average Australia carbon price), with greater opportunities when sea level rise is accounted for in the modelling. Also, we found that regional and local projects would generate up to 23 tonnes CO(2)e ha(-1) by the end of the crediting period. Our results can guide future decisions in the blue carbon market and financing schemes, however, the return on investment is dependent on the carbon price and funding scheme available for project implementation.

TI  - Large variability in organic carbon and CaCO3 burial in seagrass meadows: a case study from three Australian estuaries
AB  - Blue carbon refers to the carbon accumulation capacity of vegetated coastal habitats, including salt marshes, mangroves forests and seagrass meadows. Here we present estimates of organic carbon (C-org) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) burial rates from 4 seagrass species (Halophila ovalis, Posidonia australis, Ruppia megacarpa, Zostera muelleri) in 3 temperate estuaries on the east coast of Australia. The C-org burial rates (mean +/- SE) varied by an order of magnitude across the seagrass communities (16 +/- 3 to 130 +/- 40 g m(-2) yr(-1)). The delta C-13(org) and C-org:N ratios suggest that the seagrass communities buried variable mixtures of seagrass, algal and mangrove/terrestrial material. CaCO3 burial rates ranged from 15 +/- 11 to 188 +/- 122 g m(-2) yr(-1), which, if precipitated by calcifying organisms in these or nearby habitats, may offset up to 89\% of the C-org burial across the 8 seagrass communities. Our results highlight a large range in both C-org and CaCO3 burial rates, and the provenance of the carbon sequestered in seagrasses, factors that need to be considered when assessing the role of seagrasses in blue carbon and climate change mitigation strategies.

TI  - Oxygen Consumption and Sulfate Reduction in Vegetated Coastal Habitats: Effects of Physical Disturbance
AB  - Vegetated coastal habitats (VCHs), such as mangrove forests, salt marshes and seagrass meadows, have the ability to capture and store carbon in the sediment for millennia, and thus have high potential for mitigating global carbon emissions. Carbon sequestration and storage is inherently linked to the geochemical conditions created by a variety of microbial metabolisms, where physical disturbance of sediments may expose previously anoxic sediment layers to oxygen (O-2), which could turn them into carbon sources instead of carbon sinks. Here, we used O-2, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and pH microsensors to determine how biogeochemical conditions, and thus aerobic and anaerobic metabolic pathways, vary across mangrove, salt marsh and seagrass sediments (case study from the Sydney area, Australia). We measured the biogeochemical conditions in the top 2.5 cm of surface (0-10 cm depth) and experimentally exposed deep sediments (>50 cm depth) to simulate undisturbed and physically exposed sediments, respectively, and how these conditions may affect carbon cycling processes. Mangrove surface sediment exhibited the highest rates of O-2 consumption and sulfate (SO42-) reduction based on detailed microsensor measurements, with a diffusive O-2 uptake rate of 102 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1) and estimated sulfate reduction rate of 57 mmol S-tot(2-) m(-2) d(-1). Surface sediments (0-10 cm) across all the VCHs generally had higher O-2 consumption and estimated sulfate reduction rates than deeper layers (> 50 cm depth). O-2 penetration was <4 mm for most sediments and only down to similar to 1 mm depth in mangrove surface sediments, which correlated with a significantly higher percent organic carbon content (\%C-org) within sediments originating from mangrove forests as compared to those from seagrass and salt marsh ecosystems. Additionally, pH dropped from 8.2 at the sediment/water interface to <7-7.5 within the first 20 mm of sediment within all ecosystems. Prevailing anoxic conditions, especially in mangrove and seagrass sediments, as well as sediment acidification with depth, likely decreased microbial remineralisation rates of sedimentary carbon. However, physical disturbance of sediments and thereby exposure of deeper sediments to O-2 seemed to stimulate aerobic metabolism in the exposed surface layers, likely reducing carbon stocks in VCHs.

TI  - Carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus storage in subtropical seagrass meadows: examples from Florida Bay and Shark Bay
AB  - Seagrass meadows in Florida Bay and Shark Bay contain substantial stores of both organic carbon and nutrients. Soils from both systems are predominantly calcium carbonate, with an average of 82.1\% CaCO3 in Florida Bay compared with 71.3\% in Shark Bay. Soils from Shark Bay had, on average, 21\% higher organic carbon content and 35\% higher phosphorus content than Florida Bay. Further, soils from Shark Bay had lower mean dry bulk density (0.78 +/- 0.01 g mL(-1)) than those from Florida Bay (0.84 +/- 0.02 mg mL(-1)). The most hypersaline regions of both bays had higher organic carbon content in surficial soils. Profiles of organic carbon and phosphorus from Florida Bay indicate that this system has experienced an increase in P delivery and primary productivity over the last century; in contrast, decreasing organic carbon and phosphorus with depth in the soil profiles in Shark Bay point to a decrease in phosphorus delivery and primary productivity over the last 1000 y. The total ecosystem stocks of stored organic C in Florida Bay averages 163.5 MgCorg ha(-1), lower than the average of 243.0 MgCorg ha(-1) for Shark Bay; but these values place Shark and Florida Bays among the global hotspots for organic C storage in coastal ecosystems.

TI  - Reduction of wave energy due to monotypic coastal vegetation using response surface methodology (RSM)
AB  - Information of interactions between waves and aquatic vegetation is becoming increasingly important, in particular, due to the trend of plant-induced wave attenuation towards sustainable coastal management systems. This study aims to understand monotypic vegetation-wave interactions through three-level, four factors, response surface methodology (RSM) using laboratory wave flume under controlled conditions. Cymodocea Serrulata is one of the prevalent monotypic seagrass species found in the Gulf of Mannar, Tamilnadu, South India. It was physically simulated using synthetic plant imitations to create a relationship between wave attenuation (E%) and four direct control factors, i.e., water depth (h), wave period (T), plant density (N) and bed roughness factor (f) using an empiric model. The model developed was tested using the analysis of variance technique (ANOVA) and evaluated for the main and interaction effects of the studied parameters. The findings showed that both individually and in combination, all of the parameters considered were significantly effective on E%. All model-based findings were compared with a new collection of experimental data and validation tests were performed. The comparison of experimental results with model predictions was at a good agreement with a high coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.98 (with p-value &lt; 0.05).

TI  - New Insights into the Microplastic Enrichment in the Blue Carbon Ecosystem: Evidence from Seagrass Meadows and Mangrove Forests in Coastal South China Sea
AB  - Microplastics were recently found to aggregate in the blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), which are known for their ability to store carbon by slowing down the water flow. However, evidence is largely lacking on how the accumulation of microplastics is related to carbon sequestration in BCEs and if this trap effect is driven by its biological characteristics. In this study, the trap effect of microplastics by BCEs was evaluated for various seagrasses (Zostera japonica, Halophila ovalis, and Halophila beccarii) and mangroves (Aegiceras corniculatum and Avicennia marina). Significant accumulation was found in the seagrass meadow dominated by H. beccarii and the mangrove forest dominated by A. marina, with microplastics enriched by 1.3 to 17.6 times compared to their corresponding unvegetated sites. The abundance of microplastics varied greatly from 17.68 +/- 8.10 to 611.75 +/- 81.52 particles per kg of dry sediment, with the highest abundance in A. marina mangrove sediments. A strong positive correlation was found between the abundance of microplastics and the particulate organic carbon content at all study sites (Pearson, R = 0.86, p < 0.01). Higher diversity of microplastic colors and size was found in the H. beccarii meadow, and higher diversity of shapes was found in the A. marina forest. Our results added new insights to the understanding of the mechanism of microplastic trapping by BCEs and coupled the behavior of microplastics with the organic carbon in the sediment.

TI  - Changes in carbon storage and macrobenthic communities in a mangrove-seagrass ecosystem after the invasion of smooth cordgrass in southern China
AB  - The exotic smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) has invaded intertidal wetlands near the Ronggenshan tidal flats of Beihai, Guangxi, China, where historically seagrasses and mangroves coexisted. We investigated sediment organic carbon (SOC) storage and macrobenthic community structure in the existing mangroves (MG), S. alterniflora (SA), seagrass bed (SG), and unvegetated flat (UnV) habitats following the S. alterniflora invasion. SOC storage increased after S. alternifolia invasion in the SG and UnV habitats. Spartina alterniflora invasion changed the dominant species of the macrobenthos in the original habitats and reduced the diversity of macrobenthos in SG and UnV habitats. Clearly, S. alternifolia invasion can change the ecological functioning of south China's coastal ecosystems by altering carbon sequestration and affecting biodiversity. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Perspective: Increasing blue carbon around Antarctica is an ecosystem service of considerable societal and economic value worth protecting
AB  - Precautionary conservation and cooperative global governance are needed to protect Antarctic blue carbon: the world's largest increasing natural form of carbon storage with high sequestration potential. As patterns of ice loss around Antarctica become more uniform, there is an underlying increase in carbon capture-to-storage-to-sequestration on the seafloor. The amount of carbon captured per unit area is increasing and the area available to blue carbon is also increasing. Carbon sequestration could further increase under moderate (+1 degrees C) ocean warming, contrary to decreasing global blue carbon stocks elsewhere. For example, in warmer waters, mangroves and seagrasses are in decline and benthic organisms are close to their physiological limits, so a 1 degrees C increase in water temperature could push them above their thermal tolerance (e.g. bleaching of coral reefs). In contrast, on the basis of past change and current research, we expect that Antarctic blue carbon could increase by orders of magnitude. The Antarctic seafloor is biophysically unique and the site of carbon sequestration, the benthos, faces less anthropogenic disturbance than any other ocean continental shelf environment. This isolation imparts both vulnerability to change, and an avenue to conserve one of the world's last biodiversity refuges. In economic terms, the value of Antarctic blue carbon is estimated at between 0.65 pound and 1.76 pound billion (similar to 2.27 billion USD) for sequestered carbon in the benthos around the continental shelf. To balance biodiversity protection against society's economic objectives, this paper builds on a proposal incentivising protection by building a `non-market framework' via the 2015 Paris Agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This could be connected and coordinated through the Antarctic Treaty System to promote and motivate member states to value Antarctic blue carbon and maintain scientific integrity and conservation for the positive societal values ingrained in the Antarctic Treaty System.

TI  - Inorganic Nutrient Supplements Constrain Restoration Potential of Seedlings of the Seagrass, Posidonia australis
AB  - Seed represents a potentially ecologically sustainable source of planting units for restoring seagrasses, particularly for seagrasses where transplanting negatively impacts donor beds. However, newly germinated seeds may be nutrient limited as their underdeveloped root systems may constrain capacity to access sediment-based resources. We conducted a study in land-based aquaculture tanks to determine whether early growth of newly germinated Posidonia australis seedlings could be enhanced by adding inorganic nutrients to the sediment. Sediments were supplemented with nitrogen and phosphorus in a factorial design (no nutrients, N, P, N+P). Shoot survival, whole shoot biomass, root morphology, root architecture, and nutrient concentration of seedlings were assessed monthly for the first 4months after germination. More than 90\% of seedlings survived during the 4months of the experiment, irrespective of nutrient treatment. Growth of P. australis seedlings was not enhanced by addition of N or P to the sediment despite nutrient uptake occurring. Seedling growth was found to be more dependent on seed nutrient reserves rather than external nutrient sources for at least the first 4months after germination. Adding inorganic nutrients to the sediment also significantly reduced the development of the seedling root system in terms of biomass, length, and density of lateral root branches. This study demonstrated that inorganic nutrient supplements constrain root development and therefore capacity for successful anchorage of seagrass seedlings, and pose a significant limitation on seedling establishment when transferred to the field, as well as potentially limiting natural and transplanted seedling establishment in eutrophic sediments.

TI  - Mechanisms of solidification and subsequent embrittlement of dephosphorization slag used in a subtidal zone as an alternative to sea sand and prevention of solidification by adding dredged soil
AB  - In the recent years, steelmaking slag is attracting attention as suitable materials for restoration of estuary ecosystems. However, there is concern about solidification when the material is applied to create seagrass beds. In this study, dephosphorization slag (DePS) was immersed into seawater for 10 months to examine the solidification processes and its mechanisms to control the strength of solidification. The hypothesis in this study is that solidification could be alleviated by adding dredged soil to the DePS. After 5 months of immersion, the shear strength of the DePS increased from 1.8 to 5.0 kN/m(2); however, its shear strength decreased significantly to 3 kN/m(2) after 10 months. Furthermore, after 5 months, reddish color was observed on the surface of the DePS, whereas the color of the surface of the DePS turned black at 7 months under reducing condition with covering by mud. To validate the results, we carried out an additional study, in which the DePS was immersed in seawater, and the solidified DePS was subsequently treated with Na2S; the increase and decrease of the shear stress of DePS were reproduced. The solidified DePS before and after exposure to reducing conditions was also analyzed using a combination of microanalysis with an electron probe and Mossbauer spectroscopy. These analyses showed that the solidification was caused by the formation of bridges that composed of iron oxyhydroxides, whereas the subsequent embrittlement of the solidified DePS was attributed to changing in the chemical species of iron.

TI  - Organic carbon in seagrass sediments is influenced by seagrass canopy complexity, turbidity, wave height, and water depth
AB  - Seagrass meadows are important marine carbon sinks, yet they are threatened and declining worldwide. Seagrass management and conservation requires adequate understanding of the physical and biological factors determining carbon content in seagrass sediments. Here, we identified key factors that influence carbon content in seagrass meadows across several environmental gradients in Moreton Bay, SE Queensland. Sampling was conducted in two regions: (1) Canopy Complexity, 98 sites on the Eastern Banks, where seagrass canopy structure and species composition varied while turbidity was consistently low; and (2) Turbidity Gradient, 11 locations across the entire bay, where turbidity varied among sampling locations. Sediment organic carbon content and seagrass structural complexity (shoot density, leaf area, and species specific characteristics) were measured from shallow sediment and seagrass biomass cores at each location, respectively. Environmental data were obtained from empirical measurements (water quality) and models (wave height). The key factors influencing carbon content in seagrass sediments were seagrass structural complexity, turbidity, water depth, and wave height. In the Canopy Complexity region, carbon content was higher for shallower sites and those with higher seagrass structural complexity. When turbidity varied along the Turbidity Gradient, carbon content was higher at sites with high turbidity. In both regions carbon content was consistently higher in sheltered areas with lower wave height. Seagrass canopy structure, water depth, turbidity, and hydrodynamic setting of seagrass meadows should therefore be considered in conservation and management strategies that aim to maximize sediment carbon content.

TI  - Estuarine submerged aquatic vegetation habitat provides organic carbon storage across a shifting landscape
AB  - Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) thrives across the estuarine salinity gradient providing valuable ecosystem services. Within the saline portion of estuaries, seagrass areas are frequently cited as hotspots for their role in capturing and retaining organic carbon (C-org). Non-seagrass SAV, located in the fresh to brackish estuarine areas, may also retain significant soil C-org, yet their role remains unquantified. Given rapidly occurring landscape and salinity changes due to human and natural disturbances, landscape level carbon pool estimates from estuarine SAV habitat blue carbon estimates are needed. We assessed C-org stocks in SAV habitat soils from estuarine freshwater to saline habitats (interior deltaic) to saline barrier islands (Chandeleur Island) within the Mississippi River Delta Plain (MRDP), Louisiana, USA. SAV habitats contain C-org stocks equivalent to those reported for other estuarine vegetation types (seagrass, salt marsh, mangrove). Interior deltaic SAV C-org stocks (231.6 +/- 19.5 Mg C-org ha(-1)) were similar across the salinity gradient, and significantly higher than at barrier island sites (56.6 +/- 10.4 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Within the MRDP, shallow water SAV habitat covers up to an estimated 28,000 ha, indicating that soil C-org storage is potentially 6.4 +/- 0.1 Tg representing an unaccounted C-org pool. Extrapolated across Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico, this represents a major unaccounted pool of soil C-org. As marshes continue to erode, the ability of coastal SAV habitat to offset someof the lost carbon sequestration may be valuable. Our estimates of C-org sequestration rates indicated that conversion of eroding marsh to potential SAV habitat may help to offset the reduction of C-org sequestration rates. Across Louisiana, we estimated SAV to offset this loss by as much as 79,000Mg C yr(-1) between the 1960s and 2000s. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - SATELLITE-BASED MAPPING of ABOVE-GROUND BLUE CARBON STORAGE in SEAGRASS HABITAT WITHIN the SHALLOW COASTAL WATER
AB  - These Mapping and estimation of seagrass total above-ground carbon (STAGC) using satellite-based techniques are required to fast-track the achievement of the 2020 agenda on Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 14th. This attainment is possible as seagrass habitats provide a critical coastal ecosystem for storing blue carbon stock, sediment accumulation, fisheries production and stabilisation of coastal environment. However, seagrasses are generally declining across the globe due to anthropogenic disturbance, resulting in a prolonged growth rate of seagrasses that varies according to the species compositions. Therefore, this study aims at mapping and estimation of seagrass total above-ground carbon (STAGC) using Landsat ETM+ in the coastline of Penang. These satellite images were calibrated with Bottom Reflected Index (BRI) and Depth Invariant Index (DII) to compare the estimate of the STAGC for more accuracy. The leaving radiances of the seagrass were correlated with the corresponding in-situ measurements to predict seagrass carbon. This established relationship with BRI image shown a healthy correlation with STAGB (R2&thinsp;Combining double low line&thinsp;0.992, p&thinsp;&leq;&thinsp;0.001). Whereas the STAGB versus DII relationship has less accuracy (R2&thinsp;Combining double low line&thinsp;0.955, p&thinsp;&leq;&thinsp;0.01), adjusted R2&thinsp;Combining double low line&thinsp;0.980 and 0.978 were recorded for both BRI and DII STAGC estimate using the logistic model. Therefore, careful management of blue carbon stock is essential, as this study shall contribute to achieving targets 14.2 and 14.5 of SDG 14th by the United Nations. Â© 2019 D. A. Sani.

TI  - Conservation of blue carbon ecosystems for climate change mitigation and adaptation
AB  - Emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), has been the main cause of climate change and global warming since the mid-20th century. Blue carbon (BC) ecosystems, which include tidal marshes, mangroves, and seagrass meadows, play a key role in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Despite occupying only 0.2% of the ocean surface, they contribute 50% of carbon burial in marine sediments, equivalent to the sequestration of 1%-2% of current global CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Conversely, damage to these ecosystems risks the release of that carbon back to the atmosphere. Conserving and restoring BC ecosystems not only maintains CO2 sequestration capacity but also services essential for climate change adaptation along coasts, including prevention of shoreline erosion. However, BC ecosystems rank among the most threatened ecosystems on earth. Urgent action is needed to prevent further degradation, to avoid additional greenhouse emissions, as well as restoring degraded habitats to recover their climate change mitigation potential.

TI  - No detectable impact of small-scale disturbances on â€˜blue carbonâ€™ within seagrass beds
AB  - Seagrass meadows are among the most efficient and long-term carbon sinks on earth, but disturbances could threaten this capacity, so understanding the impacts of disturbance on carbon stored within seagrass meadowsâ€”â€˜blue carbonâ€™â€”is of prime importance. To date, there have been no published studies on the impacts of seagrass loss on â€˜blue carbonâ€™ stocks. We experimentally created several kinds of small-scale disturbances, representative of common grazer and boating impacts, within seagrass (Zostera nigracaulis) meadows in Port Phillip Bay (Australia) and measured the impacts on sediment organic carbon stocks (â€˜Corgâ€™, and other geochemical variablesâ€”%N, Î´13C, Î´15N). Disturbance had no detectable effect on Corg levels within seagrass sediments, even for high-intensity disturbance treatments, which remained bare (i.e. no seagrass recovery) for 2Â years after the disturbance. These findings challenge the widely held assumption that disturbance and concomitant loss of seagrass habitat cause release of carbon, at least for small-scale disturbances. We suggest that larger (e.g. meadow scale) disturbances may be required to trigger losses of â€˜blue carbonâ€™ from seagrass meadows.

TI  - Multitemporal seagrass carbon assimilation and aboveground carbon stock mapping using Sentinel-2 in Labuan Bajo 2019-2020
AB  - Seagrass is considered one of the most effective and efficient natural carbon sinks. In order to fully understand how it can help to adapt and mitigate climate change, information on the variability of the extent of its area, carbon stock, assimilation, sequestration, and potential emission is critical. However, details on spatially and temporally explicit seagrass biomass carbon stock, assimilation and sequestration are lacking in many parts of the world, including Indonesia as the seagrass biodiversity hot spot. To address this issue, this research aims to develop a remote sensing model to map aboveground seagrass carbon stock (AGC) and seagrass carbon assimilation rates (CA) based on multitemporal Sentinel-2 image analysis that can be used to assess the variability of seagrass over times and assess the potential carbon loss and emission reduction by seagrass. Sentinel-2 images with ideal conditions (cloud, haze, sunglint-free) and less ideal ones (cloud and haze-free, but with sunglint) were both used as the basis to develop the model. The research used two regression models, the random forest (RF) regression and stepwise regression (SW), and four input types, i.e., the reflectance bands, deglint bands, Principal Component (PC) bands, and co-occurrence texture bands. Field AGC and CA data estimated from percent cover were used to train and assess the accuracy of each model. Cross-validation was also performed to determine the model consistency when applied to images with different conditions. The results showed that the SW regression model using reflectance and deglint bands produced the most accurate and consistent AGC and CA maps. Applied to a 24-month Sentinel-2 image, from 2019 until 2020, the model showed a consistent pattern where the AGC and CA were lower from September to February and higher in March to August for both 2019 and 2020. Based on the twoyear seagrass AGC and CA maps, the monthly average AGCs for 2019 and 2020 were estimated at 28.4 +/- 2.7 and 28.4 +/- 1.3 g C/m2, respectively, while the monthly average CAs were 6.7 +/- 1.4 and 6.6 +/- 0.7 Mg C/ha/year. The total AGCs in 2019 and 2020 were 113.8 +/- 10.9 and 113.9 +/- 5.2 Mg C, and the total CAs were 2648.3 +/- 623.4 and 2636.9 +/- 281.4 Mg C/year. All these values were from 400.71 ha of seagrass meadows. Finally, the availability of such remote sensing models helps to solve the time and cost-effectiveness challenges in acquiring spatially and temporally extensive seagrass AGC and CA information. Moreover, the research was able to produce the first map of multitemporal seagrass AGC and CA in specific seagrass meadow environments in Indonesia, which can be further improved to map these data rapidly at the national level and will

AB  - Mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds are important components of coastal blue carbon, with much higher carbon burials in sediment than those in terrestrial ecosystems. Carbon accumulation rate (CAR) is a key index to evaluate the carbon sequestration capacity of coastal blue carbon ecosystems. This review introduced the principle of a long-term monitoring system, the surface elevation table-marker horizon (SET-MH), and its application in CAR evaluation in coastal wetlands. The SET-MH methods have been globally used in blue carbon sequestration capacity assessment. The establishment of the SET monitoring systems in the coasts of China will obtain in situ data set of surface elevation change and CAR, which will serve for the blue carbon assessments and provide basic information for the national carbon neutrality strategy.

TI  - Density, coverage and biomass of seagrass ecosystem in the Lobam Island, Bintan Regency - Indonesia
AB  - Seagrass ecosystem is a sea plant that can store carbon in the form of biomass and in sediments known as blue carbon. This research conducted in around coastal waters of Lobam island, Seri Kuala Lobam sub-district, Bintan regency that has seagrass community type Thalassia hemprichii and Enhalus acoroides which has an important role as a carbon sink. This research aims to determine differences of density, coverage and differences in biomass based on a seagrass tissue at the Above ground (leaf Abg.) and Below ground (rhizoma and root Blg.) of each station and the relationship between the density towards seagrass biomass. The research results show that the seagrass density in station 2 was higher than in station 1. While the difference in the seagrass biomass there is in the section of Abg (leaf) and Blg (rhizoma and root) in station 1 and conversely there is no significant difference in station 2.

TI  - Expected limits on the ocean acidification buffering potential of a temperate seagrass meadow
AB  - Ocean acidification threatens many marine organisms, especially marine calcifiers. The only global-scale solution to ocean acidification remains rapid reduction in CO2 emissions. Nevertheless, interest in localized mitigation strategies has grown rapidly because of the recognized threat ocean acidification imposes on natural communities, including ones important to humans. Protection of seagrass meadows has been considered as a possible approach for localized mitigation of ocean acidification due to their large standing stocks of organic carbon and high productivity. Yet much work remains to constrain the magnitudes and timescales of potential buffering effects from seagrasses. We developed a biogeochemical box model to better understand the potential for a temperate seagrass meadow to locally mitigate the effects of ocean acidification. Then we parameterized the model using data from Tomales Bay, an inlet on the coast of California, USA which supports a major oyster farming industry. We conducted a series of month-long model simulations to characterize processes that occur during summer and winter. We found that average pH in the seagrass meadows was typically within 0.04 units of the pH of the primary source waters into the meadow, although we did find occasional periods (hours) when seagrass metabolism may modify the pH by up to +/- 0.2 units. Tidal phasing relative to the diel cycle modulates localized pH buffering within the seagrass meadow such that maximum buffering occurs during periods of the year with midday low tides. Our model results suggest that seagrass metabolism in Tomales Bay would not provide long-term ocean acidification mitigation. However, we emphasize that our model results may not hold in meadows where assumptions about depth-averaged net production and seawater residence time within the seagrass meadow differ from our model assumptions. Our modeling approach provides a framework that is easily adaptable to other seagrass meadows in order to evaluate the extent of their individual buffering capacities. Regardless of their ability to buffer ocean acidification, seagrass meadows maintain many critically important ecosystem goods and services that will be increasingly important as humans increasingly affect coastal ecosystems.

TI  - Blue carbon stores in tropical seagrass meadows maintained under green turtle grazing
AB  - Seagrass meadows are important sites for carbon storage. Green turtles (Chelonia mydas) are marine megaherbivores that consume seagrass throughout much of their global range. With successful conservation efforts, turtle abundance will increase, leading to more meadows being returned to their natural grazed state. There is concern this may lead to a loss of carbon stored in these systems, but the effects of green turtle grazing on seagrass ecosystem carbon dynamics have not been investigated. Here we experimentally show that despite 79\% lower net ecosystem production (NEP) following grazing (24.7 vs. 119.5 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)) in a Caribbean Thalassia testudinum seagrass meadow, grazed areas maintained net positive metabolic carbon uptake. Additionally, grazing did not change the meadow production to respiration ratio, indicating it did not stimulate remineralization of sediment carbon stores. Compared to other published estimates of seagrass NEP (median: 20.6 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)), NEP in grazed Caribbean T. testudinum meadows is similar to that in many other ungrazed systems. Our results demonstrate that while grazing does decrease potential future carbon sequestration as a result of lower NEP, it does not promote a metabolic release of current carbon stocks.

TI  - Restoring coastal plants to improve global carbon storage: Reaping what we sow
AB  - Long-term carbon capture and storage (CCS) is currently considered a viable strategy for mitigating rising levels of atmospheric CO2 and associated impacts of global climate change. Until recently, the significant below-ground CCS capacity of coastal vegetation such as seagrasses, salt marshes, and mangroves has largely gone unrecognized in models of global carbon transfer. However, this reservoir of natural, free, and sustainable carbon storage potential is increasingly jeopardized by alarming trends in coastal habitat loss, totalling 30-50% of global abundance over the last century alone. Human intervention to restore lost habitats is a potentially powerful solution to improve natural rates of global CCS, but data suggest this approach is unlikely to substantially improve long-term CCS unless current restoration efforts are increased to an industrial scale. Failure to do so raises the question of whether resources currently used for expensive and time-consuming restoration projects would be more wisely invested in arresting further habitat loss and encouraging natural recovery.

TI  - Modelling predictive changes of blue carbon due to sea-level rise using InVEST model in Chilaw Lagoon, Sri Lanka
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems such as mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds, are vital for mitigating climate change owing to their high capacity for carbon capture and storage. Sea-level rise (SLR), as a result of climate change, poses a severe threat to these ecosystems due to the proximity of these ecosystems to coastal margins and, thus, modelling how blue carbon within these ecosystems will respond to SLR scenarios will prove vital to the effective management and conservation of these ecosystems. The Chilaw lagoon in Sri Lanka is home to considerably small and highly disturbed mangrove forests (422.92 ha) where the blue carbon dynamics of the lagoon are poorly studied. The primary objective of this study was to model and predict the possible changes to blue carbon in the Chilaw lagoon owing to the impact of SLR, making use of the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST 3.11.0) Coastal Blue Carbon Model. Carbon storage, carbon accumulation, carbon emissions, net carbon sequestration, and valuation of net carbon sequestration were modelled considering four SLR scenarios relating to Shared Socioeconomic Pathways indicated in the 6th assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for years 2100 and 2150. The only blue carbon land-use land cover (LULC) identified was the mangrove forest. The present blue carbon stock in the ecosystem was found to be 991.52 MgC and it is predicted to be 2049.93 MgC in the year 2100. In the year 2150, the influence of SLR is evident and carbon stocks are predicted to decrease with increasing extents of inundation. Total carbon sequestration (2021-2150), the monetary value of carbon sequestration in 2150, and carbon accumulation (2100-2150) were all predicted to decrease with rising sea levels. Emissions of carbon were found to increase with the increasing level of disturbance owing to SLR. The study represents the first time the InVEST model was utilized to model blue carbon dynamics in Sri Lanka and indicates the possible changes to blue carbon in the Chilaw lagoon and quantifies it as well.

TI  - Blue carbon storage in Fijian seagrass meadows: First insights into carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content from a tropical southwest Pacific Island
AB  - Seagrasses provide vital ecosystem services which include the accumulation and storage of carbon and nutrients in sediments and biomass. Despite their importance in climate change mitigation and adaptation, seagrass ecosystems have been poorly studied, particularly in the Pacific. Therefore, the present study assessed variability in sedimentary and vegetative C, N and P storage in three monospecific seagrass meadows (Halophila ovalis, Halodule pinifolia and Halodule uninervis), reporting baseline data for the first time. Sediment Corg stocks ranged from 31 to 47 Mg C haâˆ’1 and varied (p &lt; 0.001) between seagrass meadows, unvegetated areas and locations. Comparison of N and P storage between vegetated meadows and unvegetated areas revealed differences (p &lt; 0.05); implying seagrass meadows function as C, N and P sinks. Differences in species composition and environmental conditions, may play a key role in estimating C, N and P stocks, which are valuable data for conservation and monitoring of seagrass ecosystems.

TI  - Nutrient dynamics in core sediments of an artificial basal medium prepared with steelmaking slag and dredged materials
AB  - The availability of steelmaking slag, an industrial by-product, was examined as a component of a basal medium for the creation and regeneration of shallow habitats in coastal ecosystems. We investigated nutrient dynamics in sediments prepared with slag and dredged materials by conducting a core incubation experiment for 379 days. Silica sand was used as the reference material. Although slag caused alkalization of pore water, the pH in the surface layer recovered within a few days. The use of slag had limited influence on the dissolved inorganic nitrogen content, but pore water phosphate concentrations were considerably suppressed in slag-based media, especially when the pH was high. Nutrient diffusion fluxes from slag- and sand-based sediment cores were comparable to those in natural coastal environments. After 379 days, more than 90 \% of the nutrients remained in the top 5 cm of the cores. Moreover, the sustained release of nutrients from basal media prepared with slag may play an important role in sustaining the productivity of macrophytobenthic ecosystems, including seagrass meadows. The mesocosm-scale experiment we proposed could evaluate long-term variations of nutrient dynamics in the artificial basal media. Because of wide variations in chemical properties among the different types of slag and dredged materials, approaches similar to this study may be essential before any large-scale application to marine environments.

TI  - The influence of hydrodynamic exposure on carbon storage and nutrient retention in eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) meadows on the Swedish Skagerrak coast
AB  - Cold-temperate seagrass (Zostera marina) meadows provide several important ecosystem services, including trapping and storage of sedimentary organic carbon and nutrients. However, seagrass meadows are rapidly decreasing worldwide and there is a pressing need for protective management of the meadows and the organic matter sinks they create. Their carbon and nutrient storage potential must be properly evaluated, both at present situation and under future climate change impacts. In this study, we assessed the effect of wave exposure on sedimentary carbon and nitrogen accumulation using existing data from 53 Z. marina meadows at the Swedish west coast. We found that meadows with higher hydrodynamic exposure had larger absolute organic carbon and nitrogen stocks (at 0â€“25Â cm depth). This can be explained by a hydrodynamically induced sediment compaction in more exposed sites, resulting in increased sediment density and higher accumulation (per unit volume) of sedimentary organic carbon and nitrogen. With higher sediment density, the erosion threshold is assumed to increase, and as climate change-induced storms are predicted to be more common, we suggest that wave exposed meadows can be more resilient toward storms and might therefore be even more important as carbon- and nutrient sinks in the future.

TI  - Tiger sharks support the characterization of the world's largest seagrass ecosystem
AB  - Seagrass conservation is critical for mitigating climate change due to the large stocks of carbon they sequester in the seafloor. However, effective conservation and its potential to provide nature-based solutions to climate change is hindered by major uncertainties regarding seagrass extent and distribution. Here, we describe the characterization of the world's largest seagrass ecosystem, located in The Bahamas. We integrate existing spatial estimates with an updated empirical remote sensing product and perform extensive ground-truthing of seafloor with 2,542 diver surveys across remote sensing tiles. We also leverage seafloor assessments and movement data obtained from instrument-equipped tiger sharks, which have strong fidelity to seagrass ecosystems, to augment and further validate predictions. We report a consensus area of at least 66,000 km(2) and up to 92,000 km(2) of seagrass habitat across The Bahamas Banks. Sediment core analysis of stored organic carbon further confirmed the global relevance of the blue carbon stock in this ecosystem. Data from tiger sharks proved important in supporting mapping and ground-truthing remote sensing estimates. This work provides evidence of major knowledge gaps in the ocean ecosystem, the benefits in partnering with marine animals to address these gaps, and underscores support for rapid protection of oceanic carbon sinks. This study characterizes the world's largest seagrass ecosystem in The Bahamas by integrating spatial estimates with remote sensing and performing extensive ground-truthing of benthic habitat with 2,542 diver surveys, as well as data obtained from instrument-equipped tiger sharks, which have strong fidelity to seagrass ecosystems.

TI  - Coastal and estuarine blue carbon stocks in the greater Southeast Asia region: Seagrasses and mangroves per nation and sum of total
AB  - Climate Change solutions include CO2 extraction from atmosphere and water with burial by living habitats in sediment/soil. Nowhere on the planet are blue carbon plants which carry out massive carbon extraction and permanent burial more intensely concentrated than in SE Asia. For the first time we make a national and total inventory of data to date for â€œblue carbonâ€ buried from mangroves and seagrass and delineate the constraints. For an area across Southeast Asia of approximately 12,000,000 km2, supporting mangrove forests (5,116,032 ha) and seagrass meadows (6,744,529 ha), we analyzed the region's current blue carbon stocks. This estimate was achieved by integrating the sum of estuarine in situ carbon stock measurements with the extent of mangroves and seagrass across each nation, then summed for the region. We found that mangroves ecosystems regionally supported the greater amount of organic carbon (3095.19Tg Corg in 1st meter) over that of seagrass (1683.97 Tg Corg in 1st meter), with corresponding stock densities ranging from 15 to 2205 Mg haâˆ’1 and 31.3 to 2450 Mg haâˆ’1 respectively, a likely underestimate for entire carbon including sediment depths. The largest carbon stocks are found within Indonesia, followed by the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Myanmar, Malaysia, Thailand, Tropical China, Viet-Nam, and Cambodia. Compared to the blue carbon hotspot of tropical/subtropical Gulf of Mexico's total carbon stock (480.48 Tg Corg), Southeast Asia's greater mangroveâ€“seagrass stock density appears a more intense Blue Carbon hotspot (4778.66 Tg Corg). All regional Southeast Asian nation states should assist in superior preservation and habitat restoration plus similar measures in the USA &amp; Mexico for the Gulf of Mexico, as apparently these form two of the largest tropical carbon sinks within coastal waters. We hypothesize it is SE Asia's regionally unique oceanicâ€“geologic conditions, placed squarely within the tropics, which are largely responsible for this blue carbon hotspot, that is, consistently high ambient light levels and year-long warm temperatures, together with consistently strong inflow of dissolved carbon dioxide and upwelling of nutrients across the shallow geological plates.

TI  - Seagrass meadows improve inflowing water quality in aquaculture ponds
AB  - Water quality is critical for fish health in aquaculture production. In flow-through systems, the inflowing water normally requires quality controls and treatments for being supplied from coastal water bodies that can be polluted by nutrients, suspended solids, and microorganisms. Here we assess how seagrass meadows benefit aquaculture systems through the provision of ecosystem services (water filtration, biological control, and regulation of dissolved gasses) in the water reservoir that supplies earthen ponds in an aquaculture system in southern Portugal. In the 1.45-ha reservoir, seagrasses retained daily an estimate of 0.8-1.8 kg d(-1) of nitrogen, 0.04-0.07 kg d(-1) of phosphorus in their biomass, and 0.7-1.1 kg dw d(-1) of suspended total particulate matter, bringing benefits in terms of nutrient and particle removal from the water column. Diel and spatial variation in faecal coliforms levels (Escherichia coli) in the reservoir suggested that seagrasses, in combination with light exposure, may reduce the levels of this pathogen. Furthermore, the seagrass-dominated system oxygenated the water through photosynthesis at a faster rate than the respiratory oxygen consumption, maintaining the system above the aquaculture minimum oxygen. This study demonstrates that seagrasses can be used as a nature-based solution to overcome water quality challenges in flow-through aquaculture ponds.

TI  - Effect of nutrient enrichment on the source and composition of sediment organic carbon in tropical seagrass beds in the South China Sea
AB  - To assess the effect of nutrient enrichment on the source and composition of sediment organic carbon (SOC) beneath Thalassia hemprichii and Enhalus acoroides in tropical seagrass beds, Xincun Bay, South China Sea, intertidal sediment, primary producers, and seawater samples were collected. No significant differences on sediment delta C-13, SOC, and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) were observed between T. hemprichii and E. acoroides. SOC was mainly of autochthonous origin, while the contribution of seagrass to SOC was less than that of suspended particulate organic matter, macroalgae and epiphytes. High nutrient concentrations contributed substantially to SOC of seagrass, macroalgae, and epiphytes. The SOC, MBC, and MBC/SOC ratio in the nearest transect to fish farming were the highest This suggested a more labile composition of SOC and shorter turnover times in higher nutrient regions. Therefore, the research indicates that nutrient enrichment could enhance plant-derived contributions to SOC and microbial use efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Public perceptions of blue carbon in South Korea: Findings from a choice experiment
AB  - Blue carbon has been recently recognized worldwide as one of the various carbon reduction measures. There are three types of blue carbon in the South Korean Ocean: salt marsh, seagrass meadow, and tidal flat. This article strives to assess the economic value of blue carbon judged by the public by the use of a choice experiment (CE). Chosen attributes for the CE application were the area of salt marsh, the area of seagrass meadow, and the number of tidal flats. A CE survey of 1000 households was successfully implemented throughout the country. All the estimates for the three attributes and price held statistical significance. The yearly household economic values arising from one unit (1 km(2)) increase in each attribute were computed to be KRW 202 (USD 0.18), KRW 238 (USD 0.21), and KRW 331 (USD 0.30), respectively. This quantitative information can be used in calculating the economic benefits of a blue carbon restoration project and performing cost-benefits analysis on the project. The results demonstrate that for all three types of blue carbon, the economic benefit of restoring 1 km (2) of each blue carbon type was at least five times greater than the cost of restoring it. In other words, the restoration of blue carbon is socially profitable.

TI  - Coastal Sediment Nutrient Enrichment Alters Seagrass Blue Carbon Sink Capacity
AB  - The seagrass ecosystem is among the most efficient natural carbon sinks that can contribute to climate change mitigation. However, little is known about the effects of coastal nutrient enrichment caused by anthropogenic activities and/or climate change on the capacity of the seagrass blue carbon sink. Our experimental manipulations of sediment nutrient enrichment shifted the blue carbon sink capabilities of seagrass meadows. Sediment nutrient enrichment significantly increased the nutrient content of seagrass litter, stimulating the decomposition of rhizome + root litter by âˆ¼10% while retarding the decomposition of leaf litter by âˆ¼5%. Sediment N + P enrichment increased seagrass growth and litter production, while enrichment of N or P alone did not. Organic carbon (Corg) stocks in the surface sediments (0-5 cm) were 34% higher than those in the control with N + P enrichment due to high litter production and the low decomposition rate of nutrient-enriched leaf litter. However, Corg stocks in the subsurface sediments (5-20 cm) did not increase with sediment nutrient enrichment, which is likely due to accelerated decomposition of rhizome + root litter. Our findings suggest that nutrient loading in coastal sediments alters the blue carbon sink and storage capacities in seagrass meadows by changing the rates of carbon sequestration and decomposition.

TI  - Effects of ocean acidification and hydrodynamic conditions on carbon metabolism and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes in seagrass populations
AB  - Global change has been acknowledged as one of the main threats to the biosphere and its provision of ecosystem services, especially in marine ecosystems. Seagrasses play a critical ecological role in coastal ecosystems, but their responses to ocean acidification (OA) and climate change are not well understood. There have been previous studies focused on the effects of OA, but the outcome of interactions with co-factors predicted to alter during climate change still needs to be addressed. For example, the impact of higher CO2 and different hydrodynamic regimes on seagrass performance remains unknown. We studied the effects of OA under different current velocities on productivity of the seagrass Zostera noltei, using changes in dissolved oxygen as a proxy for the seagrass carbon metabolism, and release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in a four-week experiment using an open-water outdoor mesocosm. Under current pH conditions, increasing current velocity had a positive effect on productivity, but this depended on shoot density. However, this positive effect of current velocity disappeared under OA conditions. OA conditions led to a significant increase in gross production rate and respiration, suggesting that Z. noltei is carbon-limited under the current inorganic carbon concentration of seawater. In addition, an increase in non-structural carbohydrates was found, which may lead to better growing conditions and higher resilience in seagrasses subjected to environmental stress. Regarding DOC flux, a direct and positive relationship was found between current velocity and DOC release, both under current pH and OA conditions. We conclude that OA and high current velocity may lead to favourable growth scenarios for Z. noltei populations, increasing their productivity, non-structural carbohydrate concentrations and DOC release. Our results add new dimensions to predictions on how seagrass ecosystems will respond to climate change, with important implications for the resilience and conservation of these threatened ecosystems.

TI  - Ocean acidification as a driver of community simplification via the collapse of higher-order and rise of lower-order consumers
AB  - Increasing oceanic uptake of CO2 is predicted to drive ecological change as both a resource (i.e. CO2 enrichment on primary producers) and stressor (i.e. lower pH on consumers). We use the natural ecological complexity of a CO(2)vent (i.e. a seagrass system) to assess the potential validity of conceptual models developed from laboratory and mesocosm research. Our observations suggest that the stressor-effect of CO2 enrichment combined with its resource-effect drives simplified food web structure of lower trophic diversity and shorter length. The transfer of CO2 enrichment from plants to herbivores through consumption (apparent resource-effect) was not compensated by predation, because carnivores failed to contain herbivore outbreaks. Instead, these higher-order consumers collapsed (apparent stressor-effect on carnivores) suggesting limited trophic propagation to predator populations. The dominance of primary producers and their lower-order consumers along with the loss of carnivores reflects the duality of intensifying ocean acidification acting both as resource-effect (i.e. bottom-up control) and stressor-effect (i.e. top-down control) to simplify community and trophic structure and function. This shifting balance between the propagation of resource enrichment and its consumption across trophic levels provides new insights into how the trophic dynamics might stabilize against or propagate future environmental change.

TI  - Modelling predictive changes of blue carbon due to sea-level rise using InVEST model in Chilaw Lagoon, Sri Lanka
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems such as mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds, are vital for mitigating climate change owing to their high capacity for carbon capture and storage. Sea-level rise (SLR), as a result of climate change, poses a severe threat to these ecosystems due to the proximity of these ecosystems to coastal margins and, thus, modelling how blue carbon within these ecosystems will respond to SLR scenarios will prove vital to the effective management and conservation of these ecosystems. The Chilaw lagoon in Sri Lanka is home to considerably small and highly disturbed mangrove forests (422.92Â ha) where the blue carbon dynamics of the lagoon are poorly studied. The primary objective of this study was to model and predict the possible changes to blue carbon in the Chilaw lagoon owing to the impact of SLR, making use of the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST 3.11.0) Coastal Blue Carbon Model. Carbon storage, carbon accumulation, carbon emissions, net carbon sequestration, and valuation of net carbon sequestration were modelled considering four SLR scenarios relating to Shared Socioeconomic Pathways indicated in the 6th assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for years 2100 and 2150. The only blue carbon land-use land cover (LULC) identified was the mangrove forest. The present blue carbon stock in the ecosystem was found to be 991.52Â MgC and it is predicted to be 2049.93Â MgC in the year 2100. In the year 2150, the influence of SLR is evident and carbon stocks are predicted to decrease with increasing extents of inundation. Total carbon sequestration (2021â€“2150), the monetary value of carbon sequestration in 2150, and carbon accumulation (2100â€“2150) were all predicted to decrease with rising sea levels. Emissions of carbon were found to increase with the increasing level of disturbance owing to SLR. The study represents the first time the InVEST model was utilized to model blue carbon dynamics in Sri Lanka and indicates the possible changes to blue carbon in the Chilaw lagoon and quantifies it as well.

TI  - The thin(ning) green line? Investigating changes in Kenyaâ€™s seagrass coverage
AB  - Knowledge of seagrass distribution is limited to a few well-studied sites and poor where resources are scant (e.g. Africa), hence global estimates of seagrass carbon storage are inaccurate. Here, we analysed freely available Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery to quantify contemporary coverage and change in seagrass between 1986 and 2016 on Kenyaâ€™s coast. Using field surveys and independent estimates of historical seagrass, we estimate total cover of Kenyaâ€™s seagrass to be 317.1 + 27.2 km2, following losses of 0.85% yr21 since 1986. Losses increased from 0.29% yr21 in 2000 to 1.59% yr21 in 2016, releasing up to 2.17 Tg carbon since 1986. Anecdotal evidence suggests fishing pressure is an important cause of loss and is likely to intensify in the near future. If these results are representative for Africa, global estimates of seagrass extent and loss need reconsidering. & 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.

TI  - Groundwater-derived dissolved inorganic and organic carbon exports from a mangrove tidal creek: The missing mangrove carbon sink?
AB  - A majority of the global net primary production of mangroves is unaccounted for by current carbon budgets. It has been hypothesized that this ``missing carbon{''} is exported as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from subsurface respiration and groundwater (or pore-water) exchange driven by tidal pumping. We tested this hypothesis by measuring concentrations and delta C-13 values of DIC, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and particulate organic carbon (POC), along with radon (Rn-222, a natural submarine groundwater discharge tracer), in a tidal creek in Moreton Bay, Australia. Concentrations and delta C-13 values displayed consistent tidal variations, and mirrored the trend in Rn-222 in summer and winter. DIC and DOC were exported from, and POC was imported to, the mangroves during all tidal cycles. The exported DOC had a similar delta C-13 value in summer and winter (similar to -30 parts per thousand). The exported delta C-13-DIC showed no difference between summer and winter and had a delta C-13 value slightly more enriched (similar to -22.5 parts per thousand) than the exported DOC. The imported POC had differing values in summer (similar to -16 parts per thousand) and winter (similar to -22 parts per thousand), reflecting a combination of seagrass and estuarine particulate organic matter (POM) in summer and most likely a dominance of estuarine POM in winter. A coupled Rn-222 and carbon model showed that 93-99\% of the DIC and 89-92\% of the DOC exports were driven by groundwater advection. DIC export averaged 3 g C m(-2) d(-1) and was an order of magnitude higher than DOC export, and similar to global estimates of the mangrove missing carbon (i.e., similar to 1.9-2.7 g C m(-2) d(-1)).

TI  - Feeding on the edge: delta C-13 analysis of a macrofauna food web from disappearing seagrass beds in a polluted urban harbour - implications for biomonitoring and restoration efforts
AB  - 1. Thirty-five macrofaunal species were collected from several eelgrass (Zostera marina) beds in Boston Harbour to determine whether food provenance and carbon flow as measured by C-13 analysis differed for a seagrass community exposed to dense urbanization compared with those documented for populations distant from cities, and whether such isotopic determinations might be used for purposes of biomonitoring such disturbance. 2. In support of other studies and a previous global synthesis, the majority of benthic and epibenthic fauna inhabiting Boston Harbour eelgrass beds were found to have C-13 values within the range, -20 to -17 , indicative of epiphytic algae being the most important food source. However, the proportional abundance-weighted assessment of the distribution of individual C-13 measurements was found to be quite different from that revealed by non-quantitative, species-only assessments. 3. Because the chink shell, Lacuna vincta, which was the only species to demonstrate primary assimilation of eelgrass C-13, numerically dominated the benthic food web in Boston Harbour, over three-quarters of the total abundance of macroinvertebrates were likely to be directly dependent upon eelgrass carbon. Nevertheless, food web transfer, as measured through N-15 analysis, was extremely limited as no direct mechanism appeared to presently exist by which eelgrass carbon could be exclusively passed from chink shells to animals of higher trophic positions. 4. The dietary fidelity of these animals while experiencing severe habitat loss due to anthropogenic pollution - neither a shift toward increased vascular plant detritivory nor toward increased planktonic algivory occurred - indicates that pathways of carbon flow may offer little use as an early warning biomonitor for gauging either individual stress or community-level disturbance from coastal development. 5. Because epiphytic algae are the major food source for most macrobenthos species rather than the vascular plants themselves, the possibility exists that seagrass simulacra might be used as interim installations in order to sustain communities until such time as the aquatic conditions improve to such a degree as to enable the successful restoration of the degraded beds.

TI  - Millennial-scale changes in the molecular composition of Posidonia australis seagrass deposits: Implications for Blue Carbon sequestration
AB  - Seagrass ecosystems are recognised for their role in climate change mitigation, due to their capacity to form organic-rich sediments. The chemical recalcitrance of seagrass organs is one characteristic driving carbon storage, but the molecular background of this feature is poorly understood. We assessed molecular composition changes of Posidonia australis sheaths (SH) and roots plus rhizomes (RR) along a sediment core, encompassing 3200 cal. yr BP, by means of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C NMR), conventional analytical pyrolysis (Py-GCâ€“MS) and thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM-GCâ€“MS). Significant trends with depth (age) in the composition of both SH and RR remains of P. australis were observed from all methods. In general terms, polysaccharides become depleted (degraded) and lignin enriched (selectively preserved) as age increases, and the minor constituents cutin, suberin and condensed tannin are also preferentially depleted during ageing in both fractions. Molecular changes with ageing were smaller in SH, especially regarding polysaccharides, indicative of a superior stability compared to RR. The molecular changes observed are most pronounced within the first 75 cm of the record, which reflects the recalcitrance of P. australis detritus once it is buried below that depth (corresponding to approximately 700 cal. yr BP). The capacity of P. australis to act as a long-term carbon sink seems to be mainly related to the resistance of buried lignocellulose materials to decomposition. The results on diagenetic effects on the molecular fingerprint of seagrass detritus contribute to our understanding of carbon sequestration in Blue Carbon ecosystems. Furthermore, data comparison of the methods applied using principal component analysis (PCA) allowed us to identify consistencies, discrepancies and complementarities. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Reviews and syntheses: Spatial and temporal patterns in seagrass metabolic fluxes
AB  - Seagrass meadow metabolism has been measured for decades to gain insight into ecosystem energy, biomass production, food web dynamics, and, more recently, to inform its potential in ameliorating ocean acidification (OA). This extensive body of literature can be used to infer trends and drivers of seagrass meadow metabolism. Here, we synthesize the results from 56 studies reporting in situ rates of seagrass gross primary productivity, respiration, and/or net community productivity to highlight spatial and temporal variability in oxygen (O-2) fluxes. We illustrate that daytime net community production (NCP) is positive overall and similar across seasons and geographies. Full-day NCP rates, which illustrate the potential cumulative effect of seagrass beds on seawater biogeochemistry integrated over day and night, were also positive overall but were higher in summer months in both tropical and temperate ecosystems. Although our analyses suggest seagrass meadows are generally autotrophic, the effects on seawater oxygen are relatively small in magnitude. We also find positive correlations between gross primary production and temperature, although this effect may vary between temperate and tropical geographies and may change under future climate scenarios if seagrasses approach thermal tolerance thresholds. In addition, we illustrate that periods when full-day NCP is highest could be associated with lower nighttime O-2 and increased diurnal variability in seawater O-2. These results can serve as first-order estimates of when and where OA amelioration by seagrasses may be likely. However, improved understanding of variations in NCPDIC : NCPO2 ratios and increased work directly measuring metabolically driven alterations in seawater pH will further inform the potential for seagrass meadows to serve in this context.

TI  - Carbon stocks of coastal seagrass in Southeast Asia may be far lower than anticipated when accounting for black carbon
AB  - Valuing sedimentary `blue carbon' stocks of seagrass meadows requires exclusion of allochthonous recalcitrant forms of carbon, such as black carbon (BC). Regression models constructed across a Southeast Asian tropical estuary predicted that carbon stocks within the sandy meadows of coastal embayments would support a modest but not insignificant amount of BC. We tested the prediction across three coastal meadows of the same region: one patchy meadow located close to a major urban centre and two continuous meadows contained in separate open embayments of a rural marine park; all differed in fetch and species. The BC/total organic carbon (TOC) fractions in the urban and rural meadows with small canopies were more than double the predicted amounts, 28 +/- 1.6\% and 36 +/- 1.5\% (+/- 95\% confidence intervals), respectively. The fraction in the rural large-canopy meadow remained comparable to the other two meadows, 26 +/- 4.9\% (+/- 95\% confidence intervals) but was half the amount predicted, likely owing to confounding of the model. The relatively high BC/TOC fractions were explained by variability across sites of BC atmospheric supply, an increase in loss of seagrass litter close to the exposed edges of meadows and sediment resuspension across the dispersed patchy meadow.

TI  - Ecosystem carbon stocks of micronesian mangrove forests
AB  - Among the least studied ecosystem services of mangroves is their value as global carbon (C) stocks. This is significant as mangroves are subject to rapid rates of deforestation and therefore could be significant sources of atmospheric emissions. Mangroves could be key ecosystems in strategies addressing the mitigation of climate change though reduced deforestation. We quantified ecosystem C stocks at the seaward, interior, and upland edges of mangroves in the Republic of Palau and Yap, Federated States of Micronesia. The relatively high aboveground biomass coupled with carbon-rich soils resulted in the presence of large ecosystem carbon stocks compared to other tropical forests. Ecosystem C storage at the Palau site ranged from 479Mg/ha in the seaward zone to 1,068Mg/ha in the landward zone; in the Yap site C storage ranged from 853 to 1,385 Mg/ha along this gradient. Soils contained ~70% of the ecosystem C stocks. The elevation range of mangroves was <146 cm, suggesting that projected sea-level rise can influence a large portion of existing stands. Declines in ecosystem carbon stocks will be pronounced if mangroves are replaced by communities adapted to greater inundation such as seagrass communities, where C pools were =7% of that of mangroves (48 Mg C/ha).

TI  - Sea ice increases benthic community heterogeneity in a seagrass landscape
AB  - Sea ice plays an important role in subpolar seagrass meadows. It protects meadows against wave action and extreme temperatures. On the other hand, sea ice destroys seagrass leaves and removes plots of sediments and organics debris, leaving long-lasting ice-made tidal pools of various shapes and sizes within the meadow. The present study aimed at investigating the effect of sea ice on benthic community structure and biogeochemical processes in a subpolar seagrass meadow. Vegetated areas (V), artificially-created (aTP), and natural (nTP) tidal pools were sampled from April to October 2018 in a seagrass meadow located at Manicouagan Peninsula (Quebec; 49 degrees 5'36 `' N, 68 degrees 12'44 `' W). aTP and nTP showed similar sediment characteristics with coarser sediment and lower particulate organic carbon and total nitrogen content but also lower NOx and higher NH4+ and PO43- porewater concentrations as compared to V. Benthic macrofauna communities showed a strong seasonality with very reduced total density, biomass and species richness during wintertime (from December to April) relatively to summertime (from June to September). Benthic macrofauna communities were also more diversified and abundant in V than in aTP and nTP. Species assemblages in aTP and nTP represented a subset of species assemblages in V with any species found exclusively in tidal pools. However, total biomass was similar among treatments, suggesting that tidal pools sheltered larger individuals than vegetated areas. These results underline the importance of considering the spatial heterogeneity of seagrass meadows when assessing the functioning of these ecosystems.

TI  - Fossilized diatoms as indirect indicators of the origin of carbon stored in intertidal flats
AB  - Coastal systems store enormous carbon quantities in their sediment, which originates from various autochthonous and allochthonous sources. Carbon fluxes in coastal ecosystems have a strong effect on the recipient food-webs and carbon emission offsets. Yet, the relative importance of autochthonous vs. allochthonous C inputs to coastal carbon budget is still challenging to identify. Here, we combine diatoms preserved in the sediment with geochemical analyses to identify the sources of carbon stored in Africa's largest intertidal seagrass beds at Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania. The area lies between an active ocean upwelling and the `Sahara-dust hotspot' systems. The extensive seagrass beds of the area are thus expected to receive C from these neighboring systems in addition to producing C in-situ. Three sediment cores (50 cm) were collected at three intertidal sites with different hydrodynamic regimes, and analyzed for diatom composition, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and carbon isotopic signatures (delta C-13). Diatom taxa are grouped into three guilds: (1) benthic (epiphyte, epipelon, and epipsammon), (2) planktonic, and (3) freshwater. Benthic diatoms are considered to be autochthonous, while typical oceanic and freshwater diatoms are considered to be allochthonous. Benthic diatoms are the most diverse and abundant group, while allochthonous freshwater (i.e., dust imported) and typical upwelling (i.e., tidal imported) taxa ranked last in both abundance and species' richness. Structure equation modelling shows that variation in the stored carbon is best explained by the total abundance of diatoms and guild composition. We conclude that the C stored in the intertidal seagrass beds of Banc d'Arguin is predominantly autochthonous. Our method provides an effective way to identify historical carbon sources in coastal systems.

TI  - Mediterranean seagrasses as carbon sinks: methodological and regional differences
AB  - The increasing rates of CO2 due to anthropogenic activities are causing important potential climate threats for the Mediterranean Sea: ocean acidification and warming. In this region, two seagrass species, Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa, can play a crucial role in climate change mitigation. Seagrasses can act as carbon sinks, buffer lowering pH values during the day and storing carbon in the sediment underneath their meadows. However, available data documenting these processes are scattered and collected using different methodologies, which makes its interpretation and generalization very challenging. In this study, we analyzed published and unpublished data (collected for this study) on seagrass community metabolism to compare two methodologies, benthic chambers and multiparametric sensors, and evaluate trends through time for these two species. Furthermore, we analyzed seasonal trends of both seagrass species' metabolic rates and their variation between the eastern and western Mediterranean basins. Most evaluated meadows, 80.9 \%, were autotrophic. Calculated metabolic rates differ between methodologies, with multiparametric sensors estimating rates almost an order of magnitude higher, 143.22 +/- 28.21 (SE) mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1) for net community production (NCP) compared to an average of 18.75 +/- 3.80 (SE) mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1) for measurements with benthic chambers. However, sensors are not able to differentiate between habitats and only useful to assess seagrass metabolism at a broader community level, whereas benthic chambers are capable of evaluating rates at the species level and confirm that P. oceanica is more productive compared to C. nodosa. We found similar metabolic rates in the eastern and western Mediterranean regions for P. oceanica with the benthic-chamber technique and higher NCP in the west based on sensor measurements.

TI  - Buffer sensitivity of photosynthetic carbon utilisation in eight tropical seagrasses
AB  - Some of the mechanisms involved in inorganic carbon (Ci) acquisition by tropical seagrasses from the western Indian Ocean were described by BjÃ¶rk et al. (Mar Biol 129:363-366, 1997). However, since then, it has been found that an additional, buffer-sensitive, system of Ci utilisation may operate in some temperate seagrasses (Hellblom et al. in Aquat Bot 69:55-62, 2001, Hellblom and Axelsson in Photos Res 77:173-191, 2003); this buffer sensitivity indicates a mechanism in which electrogenic H+ extrusion may form acidic diffusion boundary layers, in which either HCO 3 - -H + is co-transported into the cells, or where HCO 3 - is converted to CO2 (as catalysed by carbonic anhydrase) prior to uptake of the latter Ci form. Because a buffer was used in the 1997 study, we found it important to reinvestigate those same eight species, taking into account the direct effect of buffers on this potential mode of Ci acquisition in these plants. In doing so, it was found that all seagrass species investigated except Cymodocea serrulata were sensitive to 50 mM TRIS buffer of the same pH as the natural seawater in which they grew (pH 8.0). Especially sensitive were Halophila ovalis, Halodule wrightii and Cymodocea rotundata, which grow high up in the intertidal zone (only ca. 50-65% of the net photosynthetic activity remained after the buffer additions), followed by the submerged Enhalus acoroides and Syringodium isoetifolium (ca. 75% activity remaining), while Thalassia hemprichii and Thalassodendron ciliatum, which grow in-between the two zones, were less sensitive to buffer additions (ca. 80-85% activity remaining). In addition to buffer sensitivity, all species were also sensitive to acetazolamide (AZ, an inhibitor of extracellular carbonic anhydrase activity) such that ca. 45-80% (but 90% for H. ovalis) of the net photosynthetic activity remained after adding this inhibitor. Raising the pH to 8.8 (in the presence of AZ) drastically reduced net photosynthetic rates (0-14% remaining in all species); it is assumed that this reduction in rates was due to the decreased CO2 concentration at the higher pH. These results indicate that part of the 1997 results for the same species were due to a buffer effect on net photosynthesis. Based on the present results, it is concluded that (1) photosynthetic Ci acquisition in six of the eight investigated species is based on carbonic anhydrase catalysed HCO 3 - to CO2 conversions within an acidified diffusion boundary layer, (2) C. serrulata appears to support its photosynthesis by extracellular carbonic anhydrase catalysed CO2 formation from HCO 3 - without the need for acidic zones, (3) H. ovalis features a system in which H+ extrusion may be followed by HCO 3 - -H + co-transport into the cells, and (4) direct, non-H +-mediated, uptake of HCO 3 - is improbable for any of the species.

TI  - Impact of seagrass loss and subsequent revegetation on carbon sequestration and stocks
AB  - Seagrass meadows are sites of high rates of carbon sequestration and they potentially support blue carbon' strategies to mitigate anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Current uncertainties on the fate of carbon stocks following the loss or revegetation of seagrass meadows prevent the deployment of blue carbon' strategies. Here, we reconstruct the trajectories of carbon stocks associated with one of the longest monitored seagrass restoration projects globally. We demonstrate that sediment carbon stocks erode following seagrass loss and that revegetation projects effectively restore seagrass carbon sequestration capacity. We combine carbon chronosequences with Pb-210 dating of seagrass sediments in a meadow that experienced losses until the end of 1980s and subsequent serial revegetation efforts. Inventories of excess Pb-210 in seagrass sediments revealed that its accumulation, and thus sediments, coincided with the presence of seagrass vegetation. They also showed that the upper sediments eroded in areas that remained devoid of vegetation after seagrass loss. Seagrass revegetation enhanced autochthonous and allochthonous carbon deposition and burial. Carbon burial rates increased with the age of the restored sites, and 18years after planting, they were similar to that in continuously vegetated meadows (26.40.8 gC(org) m(-2)year(-1)).Synthesis. The results presented here demonstrate that loss of seagrass triggers the erosion of historic carbon deposits and that revegetation effectively restores seagrass carbon sequestration capacity. Thus, conservation and restoration of seagrass meadows are effective strategies for climate change mitigation.

TI  - Carbon storage variability in seagrass meadows of Marine Poton Bako, East Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia
AB  - The increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration in the last decades leads to global warming, having an adverse effect on the environment condition on the Earth. One of the natural mechanism as an effort to reduce the impact of global warming is carbon absorption and storage through photosynthesis mechanism of seagrass vegetation. Research conducted at Poton Bako, a district in East Lombok was aimed to reveal the composition of seagrass species, density, seagrass coverage, the biomass of seagrass tissue, content of carbon storage in seagrass tissue (above and below substrates), carbon content in seagrass sediments, and estimation of carbon stock in the area. The research included observation of species composition, and the sample was collected from 0.5 m Ã— 0.5 m plot area. The total plot area was 36 on six lanes with the space between plots 25 m and between lanes 100 m. Six species from two families were found in the seagrass meadows, i.e., Cymodocea rotundata, Enhalus acoroides, Halophila minor, Holodule uninervis, Thalassia hemprichii and Thalassodendron ciliatum. The three highest total densities were C. rotundata 214.67Â±110.469 stands m-2, T. hemprichii 85.11Â±41.471 stands m-2, and H. minor 42.22Â±44.204 stands m-2. Species with the highest coverage value at all observation plots was C. rotundata (33.47Â±26.748 %), and T. ciliatum had the lowest value (2.12Â±5.071 %). The total biomass was 676.32 g DW m-2 with biomass above substrate 329.94Â±57.725 g DW m-2 and below substrate 654.88Â±81.199 g DW m-2. The carbon content of substrate ranged from 0.11% to 0.51% with the average of 0.35Â±0.081%, which was categorized low. The total average of carbon storage in seagrass was 447.92 g C m-2 comprising 142.77 g C m-2 of their tissue above substrate and 305.15 g C m-2 below substrate. Regarding the area, the total carbon stored in seagrass meadows with 56.65 ha area was 249.27 t C ha-1. Â© 2018, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

TI  - Carbon budgets of multispecies seagrass beds at Dongsha Island in the South China Sea
AB  - Biomass, production, consumption, and detrital export and decomposition of four dominant seagrass species were determined in tropical multispecies beds as a means of constructing carbon budgets. These processes varied among seagrass species. The living biomass held a high carbon stock. The leaf production of multispecies beds was also higher than that of monospecific beds. However, the sediment organic carbon stock was much lower than the global median stock, which was likely due to decomposition of most of the detritus and export to nearshore waters. Reliable measurements of decomposition and export are particularly needed to estimate the organic carbon storage rate. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Biomonitoring environmental status in semi-enclosed coastal ecosystems using Zostera noltei meadows
AB  - Semi enclosed waters, such as estuaries and lagoons, are vulnerable ecosystems that are experiencing persistent trace element (TE) contamination. Seagrasses have been reported worldwide as valuable bioindicator species for coastal contamination monitoring purpose. This is, to our knowledge, the first time the TE contamination of semi-enclosed ecosystems has been monitored along the full latitudinal gradient of the Moroccan Atlantic coast. In these ecosystems, the dominant seagrass species is Zostera noltei. 23 TEs (Fe, Al, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, V, Cu, Zn, Sr, Li, As, Ag, Cd, Sn, Sb, Mo, Ba, Ti, Pb, U, Bi and Hg) and four major elements (Na, Mg, K, Ca) were measured in sediments and seagrass leaf samples were collected upstream and downstream of five semi-enclosed areas. They contrasted in both climatic conditions and levels of environmental contamination. The Trace Element Pollution Index (TEPI) and the Trace Element Spatial Variation Index (TESVI) were calculated from chemical element concentrations in the samples. Of the five semi-enclosed areas, Sidi Moussa lagoon's sediments were the most contaminated (TEPI=1.18). The TESVI differed highly between chemical elements among the five water bodies for sediments and seagrass leaves, the highest spatial variability being for Ag (TESVI=72.01 and 21.05 respectively). For Z. noltei leaves, a latitudinal gradient of TE accumulation was recorded. A high bioconcentration factor (BCF > 1) for Cd, Mo, Sb, Ag, Zn and U indicated that the sediments were efficiently uptaken by the seagrass. Significant correlations (p < 0.05) between levels of Cd, Ag, Fe, Al, Ba, Hg, Mn and Zn in sediments and in Z. noltei leaves indicated similar contamination occurrences in both environmental matrices and their bioavailability for seagrasses. Overall, leaf TE bioconcentration among and within the study sites resulted from differences in element bioavailability and environmental conditions (climatic context, hydrological conditions and human impact). Ultimately, Z. noltei is a useful bioindicator of Cd, Mo, Sb, Ag, Zn, U, Al, Fe, Mn, Ba and Hg contamination in sediments.

TI  - Temporal Stability of Seagrass Extent, Leaf Area, and Carbon Storage in St. Joseph Bay, Florida: a Semi-automated Remote Sensing Analysis
AB  - Seagrasses are globally recognized for their contribution to blue carbon sequestration. However, accurate quantification of their carbon storage capacity remains uncertain due, in part, to an incomplete inventory of global seagrass extent and assessment of its temporal variability. Furthermore, seagrasses are undergoing significant decline globally, which highlights the urgent need to develop change detection techniques applicable to both the scale of loss and the spatial complexity of coastal environments. This study applied a deep learning algorithm to a 30-year time series of Landsat 5 through 8 imagery to quantify seagrass extent, leaf area index (LAI), and belowground organic carbon (BGC) in St. Joseph Bay, Florida, between 1990 and 2020. Consistent with previous field-based observations regarding stability of seagrass extent throughout St. Joseph Bay, there was no temporal trend in seagrass extent (23 +/- 3 km(2), tau = 0.09, p = 0.59, n = 31), LAI (1.6 +/- 0.2, tau = -0.13, p = 0.42, n = 31), or BGC (165 +/- 19 g C m(-2), tau = - 0.01, p = 0.1, n = 31) over the 30-year study period. There were, however, six brief declines in seagrass extent between the years 2004 and 2019 following tropical cyclones, from which seagrasses recovered rapidly. Fine-scale interannual variability in seagrass extent, LAI, and BGC was unrelated to sea surface temperature or to climate variability associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation or the North Atlantic Oscillation. Although our temporal assessment showed that seagrass and its belowground carbon were stable in St. Joseph Bay from 1990 to 2020, forecasts suggest that environmental and climate pressures are ongoing, which highlights the importance of the method and time series presented here as a valuable tool to quantify decadal-scale variability in seagrass dynamics. Perhaps more importantly, our results can serve as a baseline against which we can monitor future change in seagrass communities and their blue carbon.

TI  - Significance of belowground production to the long-term carbon sequestration of intertidal seagrass beds
AB  - The high biomass and sediment features of seagrass beds can make their belowground portions critical sources of blue carbon sinks. However, seagrass belowground production and decomposition have rarely been quantified in the field. To assess the significance of seagrass belowground production to carbon sequestration, belowground carbon budgets were constructed in intertidal seagrass beds of the late-successional species Thalassia hemprichii and the early-successional species Halodule uninervis in southern Taiwan. For both species, the turnover rates of the belowground portions were much longer than that of the aboveground portion, so the belowground biomass was much higher than the aboveground biomass. The leaf productivity of both species was significantly higher than the belowground productivity, but most of the leaf production decomposed within a year. The lower turnover and slower decomposition rates of the belowground portions allowed the late-successional seagrass T. hemprichii to store more carbon in the sediments than the early-successional seagrass H. uninervis. Long-term changes for the past 20 years in the sediment depth showed that the sediments of seagrass beds were increasing in the habitats at low elevation but were decreasing or had no clear trends in the habitats at high elevation or on the windward side. The carbon storage rates according to the belowground production of T. hemprichii and H. uninervis were 0.3â€“4.7 and 1.5â€“2.3 g C mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1, respectively, which can potentially contribute 53% of the long-term organic carbon storage in the low-elevation sediments.

TI  - Methane and Nitrous Oxide Emissions Complicate Coastal Blue Carbon Assessments
AB  - The role of coastal wetlands as natural `blue carbon' sinks may be counter-acted by emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Site-specific fluxes of these two potent greenhouse gases from coastal wetlands show high spatial and temporal variability , making global estimates sensitive to statistical assumptions and uncertainties. Here, we review the magnitude of CH4 and N2O fluxes from mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrasses and identify direct and indirect drivers that can control production and consumption pathways. Significant research is required to better quantify fluxes and to understand factors causing flux variability from different transport pathways before restoration of coastal blue carbon ecosystems can be reliably used for climate mitigation. Plain Language Summary Mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrass meadows are `blue carbon' ecosystems that provide a wide range of societal benefits, including carbon storage in their sediments and biomass in the case of mangroves. Yet they can also be a source-and sometimes a sink-of two powerful greenhouse gases, methane and nitrous oxide. Many processes are involved in the release and uptake of these gases; as a result, the local variability of coastal wetland emissions is high and global budgets are uncertain. The restoration of coastal blue carbon ecosystems is worthwhile for many reasons, and their existing carbon stores need to be kept intact. Nevertheless, their potential as a natural climate solution needs further attention, since it may have been over-stated.

TI  - The spatial distribution of blue carbon in the coastal wetlands of China
AB  - Coastal wetland losses in China are globally-relevant issues, as formerly sequestered soil organic carbon is released as CO2 into the atmosphere. Wetland losses also reduce the primary production by plants that would otherwise bury carbon in the future. More than 50\% of these ecosystems have been lost globally over the last half century, with this number approaching 58\% in China. The negotiation of international accords such as the Paris Climate Agreement rely on the accurate assessment of ecosystem-held carbon quantities. Our objective was to provide the first national scale survey of coastal wetland-based carbon in China. The average soil organic carbon stock (Mg SOC ha(-1)) across all three types of ecosystems was 236.91, with an average of 344.67 for mangroves, 175.14 for seagrass, and 134.37 for salt marshes. The SOC stock was greatest at 30-60 cm of depth in the case of mangroves, as opposed to 0-20 cm of depth for salt marshes. In terms of the carbon content of the standing aboveground and belowground biomass (Mg C ha(-1)), mangroves contained by far the most with an average of 253.98 and 83.96, respectively. Carbon burial rates, or the annual flux of SOC into the soil column (Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)), were 2.26 +/- 0.39 for mangroves, 1.38 +/- 0.38 for seagrass, and 2.18 +/- 0.24 for salt marshes. Through our work, we found a total of 48.12-123.95 Tg of C in China's coastal wetlands (down to 1 m of soil column depth), with an annual burial of 0.84 Tg yr(-1). We estimate the average annual emissions of CO2 to be on the order of 6.83 Tg CO2 yr(-1), due to ongoing and extensive wetland loss and conversion.

TI  - Contribution of seagrass plants to CO2 capture in a tropical seagrass meadow under experimental disturbance
AB  - Coastal vegetative habitats are known to be highly productive environments with a high ability to capture and store carbon. During disturbance this important function could be compromised as plant photosynthetic capacity, biomass, and/or growth are reduced. To evaluate effects of disturbance on CO2 capture in plants we performed a five-month manipulative experiment in a tropical seagrass (Thalassia hemprichii) meadow exposed to two intensity levels of shading and simulated grazing. We assessed CO2 capture potential (as net CO2 fixation) using areal productivity calculated from continuous measurements of diel photosynthetic rates, and estimates of plant morphology, biomass and productivity/respiration (P/R) ratios (from the literature). To better understand the plant capacity to coping with level of disturbance we also measured plant growth and resource allocation. We observed substantial reductions in seagrass areal productivity, biomass, and leaf area that together resulted in a negative daily carbon balance in the two shading treatments as well as in the high-intensity simulated grazing treatment. Additionally, based on the concentrations of soluble carbohydrates and starch in the rhizomes, we found that the main reserve sources for plant growth were reduced in all treatments except for the low-intensity simulated grazing treatment. If permanent, these combined adverse effects will reduce the plants' resilience and capacity to recover after disturbance. This might in turn have long-lasting and devastating effects on important ecosystem functions, including the carbon sequestration capacity of the seagrass system. Â© 2017 Deyanova et al.

TI  - Long-term trends and resilience of seagrass metabolism: A decadal aquatic eddy covariance study
AB  - Seagrass meadows are valued for their ecosystem services, including their role in mitigating anthropogenic CO2 emissions through `blue carbon' sequestration and storage. This study quantifies the dynamics of whole ecosystem metabolism on daily to interannual timescales for an eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadow using in situ benthic O-2 flux measurements by aquatic eddy covariance over a period of 11 yr. The measurements were part of the Virginia Coast Reserve Long-Term Ecological Research study, and covered a relatively stable period of seagrass ecosystem metabolism 6-13 yr after restoration by seeding (2007-2014), a die-off event likely related to persistently high temperatures during peak growing season in 2015, and a partial recovery from 2016 to 2018. This unique sequence provides an unprecedented opportunity to study seagrass resilience to temperature stress. With this extensive data set covering 115 full diel cycles, we constructed an average annual oxygen budget that indicated the meadow was in metabolic balance when averaged over the entire period, with gross primary production and respiration equal to 95 and -94 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1), respectively. On an interannual scale, there was a shift in trophic status from balanced to net heterotrophy during the die-off event in 2015, then to net autotrophy as the meadow recovered. The highly dynamic and variable nature of seagrass metabolism captured by our aquatic eddy covariance data emphasizes the importance of using frequent measurements throughout the year to correctly estimate trophic status of seagrass meadows.

TI  - Fate of production of the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa in different stages of meadow formation
AB  - Many seagrass species can be found in different stages of meadow formation, from recently established patches to fully developed meadows. However, Little is known about how the fate of seagrass production (i.e. herbivory, decomposition, export and carbon storage), and its ecological implications, vary across meadow development. Here we examine the fate of production of the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa (Ucria) Ascherson across increasing stages of meadow formation in a Spanish Mediterranean coastal lagoon, Alfacs Bay. Differences in time elapsed since seagrass establishment explained only a modest fraction of the variability in the fate of production, with most production routes ranging over 1 order of magnitude for any given time. However, on the whole, leaf consumption by herbivores increased by 5-fold, and decomposition and export of detrital leaves by almost 2-fold from young (i.e. 0 to 2 yr since seagrass establishment) to old (i.e. 5 to 7 yr since establishment) stages of meadow formation. Below-ground decomposition also increased by almost 1 order of magnitude from young to old stages. These results indicate that longer-established C. nodosa patches transfer greater fluxes of production to consumers, and should thus support greater levels of secondary production. Moreover, seagrass biomass and detritus increased by 3-fold from young to old stages, showing that longer-established patches may act as greater sinks of organic carbon. These results suggest that generalizations about the extent of carbon storage and secondary production maintained by seagrasses must consider the stage of meadow formation typically exhibited by the species concerned.

TI  - Methane Emissions From Nordic Seagrass Meadow Sediments
AB  - Shallow coastal soft bottoms are important carbon sinks. Submerged vegetation has been shown to sequester carbon, increase sedimentary organic carbon (C-org) and thus suppress greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The ongoing regression of seagrass cover in many areas of the world can therefore lead to accelerated emission of GHGs. In Nordic waters, seagrass meadows have a high capacity for carbon storage, with some areas being recognized as blue carbon hotspots. To what extent these carbon stocks lead to emission of methane (CH4) is not yet known. We investigated benthic CH4 emission (i.e., net release from the sediment) in relation to seagrass (i.e. Zostera marina) cover and sedimentary C-org content (\%) during the warm summer period (when emissions are likely to be highest). Methane exchange was measured in situ with benthic chambers at nine sites distributed in three regions along a salinity gradient from similar to 6 in the Baltic Sea (Finland) to similar to 20 in Kattegat (Denmark) and similar to 26 in Skagerrak (Sweden). The net release of CH4 from seagrass sediments and adjacent unvegetated areas was generally low compared to other coastal habitats in the region (such as mussel banks and wetlands) and to other seagrass areas worldwide. The lowest net release was found in Finland. We found a positive relationship between CH4 net release and sedimentary C-org content in both seagrass meadows and unvegetated areas, whereas no clear relationship between seagrass cover and CH4 net release was observed. Overall, the data suggest that Nordic Zostera marina meadows release average levels of CH4 ranging from 0.3 to 3.0 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1), which is at least 12-78 times lower (CO2 equivalents) than their carbon accumulation rates previously estimated from seagrass meadows in the region, thereby not hampering their role as carbon sinks. Thus, the relatively weak CH4 emissions from Nordic Z. marina meadows will not outweigh their importance as carbon sinks under present environmental conditions.

TI  - Bioturbator-stimulated loss of seagrass sediment carbon stocks
AB  - Seagrass ecosystems are highly productive, and are sites of significant carbon sequestration. Sediment-held carbon stocks can be many thousands of years old, and persist largely due to sediment anoxia and because microbial activity is decreasing with depth. However, the carbon sequestered in seagrass ecosystems may be susceptible to remineralization via the activity of bioturbating fauna. Microbial priming is a process whereby remineralization of sediment carbon (recalcitrant organic matter) is stimulated by disturbance, i.e., burial of a labile source of organic matter (seagrass). We investigated the hypothesis that bioturbation could mediate remineralization of sediment carbon stocks through burial of seagrass leaf detritus. We carried out a 2-month laboratory study to compare the remineralization (measured as CO 2 release) of buried seagrass leaves (Zostera muelleri) to the total rate of sediment organic matter remineralization in sediment with and without the common Australian bioturbating shrimp Trypaea australiensis (Decapoda: Axiidea). In control sediment containing seagrass but no bioturbators, we observed a negative microbial priming effect, whereby seagrass remineralization was favored over sediment remineralization (and thus preserving sediment stocks). Bioturbation treatments led to a two- to five-fold increase in total CO 2 release compared to controls. The estimated bioturbator-stimulated microbial priming effect was equivalent to 15% of the total daily sediment-derived CO 2 releases. We propose that these results indicate that bioturbation is a potential mechanism that converts these sediments from carbon sinks to sources through stimulation of priming-enhanced sediment carbon remineralization. We further hypothesized that significant changes to seagrass faunal communities may influence seagrass sediment carbon stocks. Â© 2018 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography

TI  - Organic carbon sources to SE Asian coastal sediments
AB  - The carbon, nitrogen and the stable carbon isotopic composition, Î´13C, of organic matter has been used to elucidate the source(s) of this material to coastal sediments. Sediments were collected at 15 coastal locations in the Philippines and Vietnam, which broadly represented different depositional environments ranging from seagrass meadows, through seagrass meadows located near mangroves and to mangrove stands. In addition, short-term sediment traps were deployed at 12 of the sites where seagrass was present. Mean sediment organic carbon concentration and C/N increased and Î´13C of organic matter decreased from seagrass to mangrove dominated settings. The organic carbon flux measured by the sediment trap deployments was very variable (32 Â± 3 to âˆ¼ 700 mmol m-2 d-1) and represented only a small fraction of the total particle flux. The importance of seagrass as a source of organic matter to the sediments was assessed by using a simple mixing model and the average Î´ 13C values for seagrass, their epiphytic community and surface water particulate matter (seston). A positive correlation between seagrass leaf biomass and sediment Î´13C in seagrass dominated settings suggests that these macrophytes do significantly influence the composition of sedimentary organic matter. Seagrass was however rarely found to be the dominant source of organic matter to the underlying sediments. Both sediment trap and sediment data suggest that material of planktonic origin was the dominant source of sedimentary organic matter in these settings. At the sites dominated by mangroves the concentration of organic matter (âˆ¼ 1-13 Ã— 103 mmol g-1) in the sediment is generally higher than at seagrass dominated sites due to the outwelling of organic matter from the mangrove stands. Mangrove organic matter often dominates the sedimentary input but other sources of organic matter must contribute to cause the observed range in sediment Î´13C. Â© 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Seagrass community-level controls over organic carbon storage are constrained by geophysical attributes within meadows of Zanzibar, Tanzania
AB  - The aim of this work was to explore the feasibility of using plant functional traits to identify differences in sediment organic carbon (OC) storage within seagrass meadows. At 19 sites within three seagrass meadows in the coastal waters of Zanzibar, Tanzania, species cover was estimated along with three community traits hypothesized to influence sediment OC storage (above and belowground biomass, seagrass tissue nitrogen content, and shoot density). Sediments within four biogeographic zones (fore reef, reef flat, tidal channel, and seagrass meadow) of the landscape were characterized, and sediment cores were collected within seagrass meadows to quantify OC storage in the top 25 cm and top meter of the sediment. We identified five distinct seagrass communities that had notable differences in the plant traits, which were all residing within a thin veneer (ranging from 19 to 78 cm thick) of poorly sorted, medium to coarsely grained carbonate sands on top of carbonate rock. One community (B), dominated by Thalassodendron ciliatum, contained high amounts of above (972 +/- 74 g DW m(-2)) and belowground (682 +/- 392 g DW m(-2)) biomass composed of low-elemental-quality tissues (leaf C: N = 24.5; rhizome C: N = 97). While another community (C), dominated by small-bodied ephemeral seagrass species, had significantly higher shoot density (4178 shoots m(-2)). However, these traits did not translate into differences in sediment OC storage and across all communities the percentage of OC within sediments was similar and low (ranging from 0.15\% to 0.75 \%), as was the estimated OC storage in the top 25 cm (14.1 +/- 2.2 Mg C ha(-1)) and top meter (33.9 +/- 7.7 Mg C ha(-1)) of sediment. These stock estimates are considerably lower than the global average (194.2 +/- 20.2Mg C ha(-1)) reported for other seagrass ecosystems and are on the lower end of the range of estimates reported for the tropical Indo-Pacific bioregion (1.9 to 293Mg C ha(-1)). The uniformly low OC storage across communities, despite large inputs of low-quality belowground tissues in community B, indicates that the geophysical conditions of the coarse, shallow sediments at our sites were not conducive to OC stabilization and outweighed any variation in the quantity or quality of seagrass litter inputs. These results add to a growing body of evidence showing that geophysical conditions of the sediment modulate the importance of plant traits in regards to retention of OC within blue carbon ecosystems and cautions against the use of plant traits as a proxy for sediment OC storage across all seagrass ecosystems.

TI  - Measurement method of blue carbon sink and its potential assessment
AB  - Climate change is an important issue facing the world today, which restricts the sustainable development of human economy and society. As the richest and most active carbon source sink on the planet, the blue ocean plays a decisive role in the global ecosystem. This paper discusses the blue carbon measurement method and monitoring system for mangroves, tidal flat wetlands, fisheries, salt marshes and seagrass restoration from the perspective of methodology. It evaluates the blue carbon potential in China's oceans so as to promote the integration of blue carbon into climate change governance mechanisms in the direction of internationalization, standardization, and specialization. It provides reference for the implementation of blue carbon measurement standards and their methodological applications. Â© 8th International Symposium on Project Management, ISPM 2020.

TI  - Constraints and opportunities for market-based finance for the restoration and protection of blue carbon ecosystems
AB  - The restoration and protection of ``blue carbon{''} ecosystems - mangroves, seagrasses, and tidal marshes - has potential to offset greenhouse gas emissions and improve coastal livelihoods. However, realisation of this potential relies on global investment in restoration and protection, which in turn relies on appropriate funding mechanisms that are currently impeded by multiple constraints. Constraints include commercial considerations by private investors (including reliable estimates of financial returns, risk quantification and management, and supply chain impacts), regulatory and legal uncertainty (such as the complexity of property rights in coastal areas, policy coordination across jurisdictions, and stable policy consistent with the duration of blue carbon projects). There are, however, opportunities to improve on current practices, including better stakeholder engagement (including social license to operate, and knowledge transfer to promote best practices), and targeted use of public and philanthropic funding (to subsidise demonstration projects, reduce financial risk through collaterals, and promote low-profit but high co-benefit projects). In this paper, a strategy for the realisation of potential benefits through commercially viable and scientifically robust blue carbon initiatives is presented alongside insights and guidance for the policy, research, civil society, and private sectors to achieve these important long-term outcomes.

TI  - Country-specific emission factor for developing a tier 3 system of Indonesia's seagrass carbon inventory
AB  - Climate action regarding carbon inventory requires baseline assessment, data regarding annual changes, and evaluation of reductions in carbon emissions. However, many studies of seagrass ecosystems have focused only on carbon stock and sequestration, neglecting the importance of the carbon emission factor. It is known that emission factors for land-use change, including those in seagrass ecosystems, can be derived from biomass and sediment carbon stock. Since currently Indonesia only has data for biomass carbon stock, we propose the measurement of province-based emission factors. This study combines the available carbon stock data reported in national or international publications and conducts a meta-analysis to obtain emission factor values. The results show that the biomass standing carbon stock of Indonesia's seagrass meadows ranges from 0.30 tC/ha (i.e., Special Region of Yogyakarta) to 16.51 tC/ha (i.e., Gorontalo province), while emission factor ranges from 0.012 tC/ha/yr to 0.661 tC/ha/yr (equal to 0.05 t CO2/ha/yr to 2.42 t CO2/ha/yr). These findings will be beneficial for developing Tier 3 carbon inventory since they allow country-specific emission factor for the seagrass ecosystem to be measured.

TI  - Plant size metrics and organic carbon content of Florida salt marsh vegetation
AB  - Carbon stored in soil and vegetative biomass in mangrove swamps, salt marshes, and seagrass flats (â€œcoastal blue carbonâ€) is a significant component of the coastal carbon budget due to the ability of these ecosystems to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide as plant biomass and peat. Growing interest in the protection of these essential yet vulnerable coastal ecosystems, as well as recognition of their capacity to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide, has led to the need for rapid and accurate quantification of location-specific coastal blue carbon stocks. This study provides allometric equations for the calculation of aboveground dry biomass based on plant height for 18 salt marsh species from Tampa Bay, Florida, USA. The 18 plant species were also analyzed for carbon and nitrogen content to determine the appropriate carbon conversion factor to use for blue carbon calculations. The salt marsh plants had an average of 1.2Â Â±Â 0.4% nitrogen and 41.1Â Â±Â 5.5% carbon. With the exception of Batis maritima, which had a carbon content of only 23.4%, carbon content for all other species ranged from 33.4â€“47.1%. The four most succulent plant species in this study contained an average of 33.3Â Â±Â 7.0% carbon, while the nine graminoid species contained 44.4Â Â±Â 2.0% carbon. These species-specific equations and carbon data provide non-destructive methods to rapidly quantify vegetative biomass and carbon stocks for monitoring efforts and blue carbon stock assessments.

TI  - Seagrass blue carbon dynamics in the Gulf of Mexico: Stocks, losses from anthropogenic disturbance, and gains through seagrass restoration
AB  - Seagrasses comprise a substantive North American and Caribbean Sea blue carbon sink. Yet fine-scale estimates of seagrass carbon stocks, fluxes from anthropogenic disturbances, and potential gains in sedimentary carbon from seagrass restoration are lacking for most of the Western Hemisphere. To begin to fill this knowledge gap in the subtropics and tropics, we quantified organic carbon (Corg) stocks, losses, and gains from restorations at 8 previously-disturbed seagrass sites around the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) (nÂ =Â 128 cores). Mean natural seagrass Corg stocks were 25.7Â Â±Â 6.7Â MgÂ CorgÂ haâˆ’Â 1 around the GoM, while mean Corg stocks at adjacent barren sites that had previously hosted seagrass were 17.8Â MgÂ CorgÂ haâˆ’Â 1. Restored seagrass beds contained a mean of 38.7Â Â±Â 13.1Â MgÂ CorgÂ haâˆ’Â 1. Mean Corg losses differed by anthropogenic impact type, but averaged 20.98Â Â±Â 7.14Â MgÂ CorgÂ haâˆ’Â 1. Corg gains from seagrass restoration averaged 20.96Â Â±Â 8.59Â MgÂ haâˆ’Â 1. These results, when combined with the similarity between natural and restored Corg content, highlight the potential of seagrass restoration for mitigating seagrass Corg losses from prior impact events. Our GoM basin-wide estimates of natural Corg totaled ~Â 36.4Â Tg for the 947,327Â ha for the USA-GoM. Including Mexico, the total basin contained an estimated 37.2â€“37.5Â Tg Corg. Regional US-GoM losses totaled 21.69Â Tg Corg. Corg losses differed significantly among anthropogenic impacts. Yet, seagrass restoration appears to be an important climate change mitigation strategy that could be implemented elsewhere throughout the tropics and subtropics. Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Blue Carbon Storage Capacity of Temperate Eelgrass (Zostera marina) Meadows
AB  - Despite the importance of coastal ecosystems for the global carbon budgets, knowledge of their carbon storage capacity and the factors driving variability in storage capacity is still limited. Here we provide an estimate on the magnitude and variability of carbon stocks within a widely distributed marine foundation species throughout its distribution area in temperate Northern Hemisphere. We sampled 54 eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows, spread across eight ocean margins and 36 degrees of latitude, to determine abiotic and biotic factors influencing organic carbon (C-org) stocks in Zostera marina sediments. The C-org stocks (integrated over 25-cm depth) showed a large variability and ranged from 318 to 26,523gC/m(2) with an average of 2,721gC/m(2). The projected C-org stocks obtained by extrapolating over the top 1m of sediment ranged between 23.1 and 351.7MgC/ha, which is in line with estimates for other seagrasses and other blue carbon ecosystems. Most of the variation in C-org stocks was explained by five environmental variables (sediment mud content, dry density and degree of sorting, and salinity and water depth), while plant attributes such as biomass and shoot density were less important to C-org stocks. Carbon isotopic signatures indicated that at most sites <50\% of the sediment carbon is derived from seagrass, which is lower than reported previously for seagrass meadows. The high spatial carbon storage variability urges caution in extrapolating carbon storage capacity between geographical areas as well as within and between seagrass species.

TI  - The atmospheric carbon sequestration potential of man-made tidal lagoons
AB  - Understanding sequestration of carbon by coastal ecosystems is central to addressing the role they play in climate change mitigation. To quantify this process, accurate measurements of CO2 fluctuation, coupled with variations in residence time of coastal water-bodies are required. Nearshore ecosystems, including coastal lagoons, may provide an effective sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide, particularly those containing productive biota such as seagrass. However, the rate and pattern of carbon sequestration in seagrass meadows across a range of environmental settings is still poorly constrained. In this study, we utilize a robust physical tidal model, along with biogeochemical dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) assessment, to estimate water residence time and net sequestration of atmospheric CO2 in an intertidal lagoon containing a seagrass (Zostera noltii) meadow. Total alkalinity and pH measurements taken from advected water mass exchanged with the open ocean at inlet boundaries are used to calculate DIC and pCO(2). A predictive model of hydrodynamics provides good approximation of mean water residence time to within 6 h ( +/- 3 s.d). Results indicate that during the daytime study period the lagoon is a sink for carbon, having a mean net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of 3.0 +/- 0.4 mmol C m(-2) hr(-1). An equivalent diel NEP range of between 15.23 and -9.24 mmol C m(-2)d(-1) is calculated based on reported shallow water pelagic respiration rates. Moreover, approximately 4\% of DIC availability occurs from atmospheric CO2 transfer to lagoon water. However, a negative diel rate of -82 +/- 81 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) is found, assuming overnight respiration ascertained from converted Zostera noltii 0 2 utilization. We hypothesize that analogous regional nearshore ecosystems provide baseline study sites suitable to elucidate the carbon capture potential of planned, nearby tidal range energy schemes.

TI  - Major regression of Posidonia oceanica meadows in relation with recreational boat anchoring: A case study from Sant'Amanza bay
AB  - The anchoring of large recreational craft constitutes one of the main threats in shallow marine habitats. In the Mediterranean, this activity has seen constant development during the last decades, causing major physical disturbances in Posidonia oceanica meadows and associated ecosystem services. In this context, the main aims of the present study are to estimate the impact of this anchoring on P. oceanica meadows surface areas and carbon fixation and sequestration capacities, in a particularly highly-frequented area (Sant'Amanza bay, Corsica Island). Accurate benthic marine habitats mapping was performed yearly (2019-2021) using a drone coupled with ground-truthing data. The evaluation of carbon fixation and sequestration by the plant was measured at 12 stations within the bay (-5 m to-30 m). The maps of the marine habitats reveal an extensive regression of P. oceanica meadows (7.5 ha) between 2019 and 2020. This destruction represents a 9\% decline in the total carbon fixation and sequestration performed each year by P. oceanica meadows within the bay. The related ecosystem services loss is estimated at 4.72 million euro yr(-1). Although an overall decline of boat anchoring in the seagrass meadow has been observed (e.g. recent enforcement of anchoring regulations), other solutions should be experimented to manage this major carbon sink.

TI  - Seagrass blue carbon spatial patterns at the meadow-scale
AB  - Most information on seagrass carbon burial derives from point measurements, which are sometimes scaled by meadow area to estimate carbon stocks; however, sediment organic carbon (Corg) concentrations may vary with distance from the meadow edge, resulting in spatial gradients that affect the accuracy of stock estimates. We mapped sediment Corg concentrations throughout a large (6 km2) restored seagrass meadow to determine whether Corg distribution patterns exist at different spatial scales. The meadow originated from â‰¤1-acre plots seeded between 2001 and 2004, so we expected Corg to vary spatially according to the known meadow age at sample sites and with proximity to the meadow edge. Applying spatial autoregressive models allowed us to control for spatial autocorrelation and quantify the relative effects of edge proximity and age on Corg concentrations. We found that edge proximity, not age, significantly predicted the meadow-scale Corg distribution. We also evaluated relationships between Corg and a variety of specific explanatory variables, including site relative exposure, shoot density, sediment grain size, and bathymetry. Factors known to affect carbon burial at the plot-scale, such as meadow age and shoot density, were not significant controls on the meadow-scale Corg distribution. Strong correlations between Corg, grain size, and edge proximity suggest that current attenuation increases fine-sediment deposition and, therefore, carbon burial with distance into the meadow. By mapping the sediment Corg pool, we provide the first accurate quantification of an enhanced carbon stock attributable to seagrass restoration. The top 12 cm of the bed contain 3660 t Corg, approximately 1200 t more Corg than an equal area of bare sediment. Most of that net increase is concentrated in a meadow area with low tidal current velocities. Managers should account for the effects of meadow configuration and current velocity when estimating seagrass blue carbon stocks. Our results suggest that a large, contiguous meadow should store more blue carbon than an equal area of small meadow patches. Â© 2017 Oreska et al.

TI  - Resilient consumers accelerate the plant decomposition in a naturally acidified seagrass ecosystem
AB  - Anthropogenic stressors are predicted to alter biodiversity and ecosystem functioning worldwide. However, scaling up from species to ecosystem responses poses a challenge, as species and functional groups can exhibit different capacities to adapt, acclimate, and compensate under changing environments. We used a naturally acidified seagrass ecosystem (the endemic Mediterranean Posidonia oceanica) as a model system to examine how ocean acidification (OA) modifies the community structure and functioning of plant detritivores, which play vital roles in the coastal nutrient cycling and food web dynamics. In seagrass beds associated with volcanic CO2 vents (Ischia, Italy), we quantified the effects of OA on seagrass decomposition by deploying litterbags in three distinct pH zones (i.e., ambient, low, extreme low pH), which differed in the mean and variability of seawater pH. We replicated the study in two discrete vents for 117 days (litterbags sampled on day 5, 10, 28, 55, and 117). Acidification reduced seagrass detritivore richness and diversity through the loss of less abundant, pH-sensitive species but increased the abundance of the dominant detritivore (amphipod Gammarella fucicola). Such compensatory shifts in species abundance caused more than a threefold increase in the total detritivore abundance in lower pH zones. These community changes were associated with increased consumption (52%â€“112%) and decay of seagrass detritus (up to 67% faster decomposition rate for the slow-decaying, refractory detrital pool) under acidification. Seagrass detritus deployed in acidified zones showed increased N content and decreased C:N ratio, indicating that altered microbial activities under OA may have affected the decay process. The findings suggest that OA could restructure consumer assemblages and modify plant decomposition in blue carbon ecosystems, which may have important implications for carbon sequestration, nutrient recycling, and trophic transfer. Our study highlights the importance of within-community response variability and compensatory processes in modulating ecosystem functions under extreme global change scenarios.

TI  - Consideration of the carbon sequestration potential of seagrass to inform recovery and restoration projects within the Essex Estuaries Special Area of Conservation (SAC), United Kingdom
AB  - A review of available research into the blue carbon potential of seagrass was undertaken. This was then used to inform an analysis of the potential current, historic, and future value of carbon sequestered and stored in the Essex Estuaries Special Area of Conservation (SAC). The assessed status of Zostera in the SAC highlights the extent of historic loss and continued degradation of this designated sub-feature, and current water quality is incompatible with recovery or restoration. Seagrass blue carbon currently stored within the SAC equates to âˆ¼18,350 t C at a sequestration rate of 117.15 t C yrâˆ’1, with a lost/potential of 534,700 t C storage capacity. The calculated financial value of current stocks (Â£4.6Â m) is dwarfed by the lost/potential monetary value of carbon storage, Â£135Â m, and the forfeited sequestration of Â£860,000-worth of carbon annually from degraded habitat. The use of carbon offset credits could help fund the huge potential for restoration that exists within the SAC. Â© 2022, The Author(s).

TI  - Deciphering organic matter sources and ecological shifts in blue carbon ecosystems based on molecular fingerprinting
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (BCE) play an essential role in the global carbon cycle by removing atmospheric carbon dioxide and storing it as organic carbon (OC) in biomass and sediments. However, organic matter (OM) deposition and degradation/preservation processes are poorly understood, especially on the long-term and at molecular scales. We analysed sediment samples from six cores collected in tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrasses (up to 150 cm long cores spanning up to 10,000 yrs of OC accumulation) from Spencer Gulf (South Australia), by pyrolysis (Py-GCâ€“MS and THM-GCâ€“MS), and we compared the results with elemental and stable isotope data, to decipher OM provenance and to assess degradation/preservation dynamics. The results showed that: (1) the major biopolymers preserved were polysaccharides, polyphenolic moieties (lignin and tannin) and polymethylenic moieties (e.g. cutin, suberin, chlorophyll) with smaller apportions of proteins and resins; (2) the OM originates predominantly from vascular plant materials (in particular lignocellulose) that have been well-preserved, even in some of the oldest sediments; (3) mangroves were found to be the most efficient OC sinks, partially explained by syringyl lignin preservation; (4) seagrasses were shown to store polysaccharide-enriched OM; (5) large proportions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in surficial tidal marsh and mangrove sediments probably reflect pyrogenic OM from industrial combustion, and; (6) â€œecosystem shiftsâ€, i.e. mangrove encroachment in tidal marsh and transition from seagrass to mangrove, were detected. Deposition environment and source vegetation control OC sequestration and there is no specific recalcitrant form of OM that is selectively preserved. For the first time, we demonstrate how analytical pyrolysis in combination with stable isotope analysis can be used to reconstruct (palaeo-)ecological shifts between different BCE. This study improves our knowledge on OC accumulation dynamics and the response of BCE to environmental change, which can inform the implementation of strategies for climate change mitigation.

TI  - Carbon sequestration index as a determinant for climate change mitigation: Case study of Bintan Island
AB  - The increase of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) affects the global carbon cycle altering the atmospheric system and initiates the climate changes. There are two ways to mitigate these changes, by maintaining the greenhouse gasses below the carbon budget and by conserving the marine and terrestrial vegetation for carbon sequestration. These two strategies become variable to the carbon sequestration index (CSI) that represents the potential of a region in carbon sequestration, according to its natural capacity. As a study case, we conducted carbon sequestration research in Bintan region (Bintan Island and its surrounding), Riau Archipelago province. This research was aimed to assess the CSI and its possibility for climate change mitigation. We observed carbon sequestration of seagrass meadows and mangrove, greenhouse gas (CO2) emission (correlated to population growth, the increase of vehicles), and CSI. Bintan region has 125,849.9 ha of vegetation area and 14,879.6 ha of terrestrial and marine vegetation area, respectively. Both vegetation areas are able to sequester 0.262 Tg C yr(-1) in total and marine vegetation contributes about 77.1\%. Total CO2 emission in Bintan region is up to 0.273 Tg C yr(-1), produced by transportation, industry and land use sectors. Therefore, CSI of the Bintan region is 0.98, which is above the global average (i.e. 0.58). This value demonstrates that the degree of sequestration is comparable to the total carbon emission. This result suggests that Bintan's vegetation has high potential for reducing greenhouse gas effects.

TI  - Modeled CO2 Emissions from Coastal Wetland Transitions to Other Land Uses: Tidal Marshes, Mangrove Forests, and Seagrass Beds
AB  - The sediments of coastal wetlands contain large stores of carbon which are vulnerable to oxidation once disturbed, resulting in high levels of CO2 emissions that may be avoided if coastal ecosystems are conserved or restored. We used a simple model to estimate CO2 emissions from mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and tidal marshes based on known decomposition rates for organic matter in these ecosystems under either oxic or anoxic conditions combined with assumptions of the proportion of sediment carbon being deposited in either oxic or anoxic environments following a disturbance of the habitat. Our model found that over 40 years after disturbance the cumulative CO2 emitted from tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass beds were 70-80\% of the initial carbon stocks in the top meter of the sediment. Comparison of our estimates of CO2 emissions with empirical studies suggests that (1) assuming 50\% of organic material moves to an oxic environment after disturbance gives rise to estimates that are similar to CO2 emissions reported for tidal marshes; (2) field measurements of CO2 emissions in disturbed mangrove forests were generally higher than our modeled emissions that assumed 50\% of organic matter was deposited in oxic conditions, suggesting higher proportions of organic matter may be exposed to oxic conditions after disturbance in mangrove ecosystems; and (3) the generally low observed rates of CO2 emissions from disturbed seagrasses compared to our estimates, assuming removal of 50\% of the organic matter to oxic environments, suggests that lower proportions may be exposed to oxic conditions in seagrass ecosystems. There are significant gaps in our knowledge of the fate of wetland sediment carbon in the marine environment after disturbance. Greater knowledge of the distribution, form, decomposition, and emission rates of wetland sediment carbon after disturbance would help to improve models.

TI  - Clam harvesting decreases the sedimentary carbon stock of a Zostera marina meadow
AB  - Seagrass meadows provide ecosystem services that contribute to climate mitigation and ecosystem resilience in coastal environments, being recognised among the most effective carbon sink ecosystems on Earth. Although seagrass meadows are declining worldwide at alarming rates, direct measurements of the consequences of habitat degradation on the sedimentary carbon stock remains still scarce. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of the physical disturbance caused by clam harvesting on the capacity of a subtidal Zostera marina meadow to accumulate organic matter and sequester carbon. Biotic (seagrass cover, density and biomass) and abiotic factors (water depth and sediment grain size distribution) of the studied meadow were characterized and carbon stocks in control and impacted areas of vegetated and bare sand zones were compared. The physical disturbance resulted in a significant reduction in shoot density (63\%) and biomass (64\%) in the impacted area with respect to the adjacent zone not affected by the disturbance, whereas the sedimentary carbon stock was reduced by 50\%, reaching similar levels to those recorded in un-vegetated areas. The meadow exposed to the harvesting activity showed a decreasing capacity to sequester carbon by reducing the seagrass standing stock and carbon preservation in the associated sediments. Thus, clam harvesting activity not only eroded the historical carbon stock accumulated over decades but also endangers further potential accumulation. Therefore, sustainable management of the exploited area should take into account not only the durability of dam stocks but also the resilience of the seagrass meadow and its capacity to provide critical ecosystem services.

TI  - Estimating Seagrass Community Metabolism Using Benthic Chambers: The Effect of Incubation Time
AB  - Seagrass meadows are highly productive ecosystems that provide high-value ecosystem services and significantly contribute to carbon sequestration. Net community production (NCP) and community respiration (CR) in seagrass meadows are usually estimated from changes in oxygen concentration during in situ incubations in benthic chambers. Nevertheless, incubation chambers prevent water renovation, thus leading to an increase in pH and O2 and a possible super-saturation inside the chamber, particularly during daytime at high irradiances. We tested the effect of incubation time on seagrass meadows NCP using benthic chambers in a pristine Posidonia oceanica meadow in Corsica, France. Incubations lasting 1.5â€“2, 3â€“5, 12, and 24Â h were conducted along the day. The results showed that NCP closely follows dial irradiance pattern, with maximum NCP values (23.1 Â± 2.8Â mmolÂ O2 mâˆ’2Â hâˆ’1) obtained for 1.5-2 h incubations at solar noon. A significant underestimation of NCP budgets was detected with increasing incubation times. When compared to 1.5-2 h incubations, the daylight NCP values obtained for 3-5 h and 12 h incubations underestimated NCP by 24 and 44Â %, respectively, while 12 h night incubations underestimated CR by 63Â %. When daily budgets were estimated, NCP calculated from 12 and 24 h incubations, the most used incubation times to estimate NCP in P. oceanica, underestimated it by 19 and 76Â %, respectively, when compared to the daily budget obtained from 1.5-2 h incubations. Other factors, such as chamber volume and enclosed biomass, in conjunction with incubation time, are also discussed. We showed here that the values of P. oceanica NCP presently reported in the literature may be considerably underestimated. The role of this community as a key carbon sink in the Mediterranean may thus be underrated. Â© 2015, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.

TI  - Losses and recovery of organic carbon from a seagrass ecosystem following disturbance
AB  - Seagrasses areamong the Earthâ€™smost efficient and long-termcarbon sinks, but coastal development threatens this capacity. We report new evidence that disturbance to seagrass ecosystems causes release of ancient carbon. In a seagrass ecosystem that had been disturbed 50 years ago, we found that soil carbon stocks declined by 72%, which, according to radiocarbon dating, had taken hundreds to thousands of years to accumulate.Disturbed soils harboured different benthic bacterial communities (according to 16S rRNA sequence analysis), with higher proportions of aerobic heterotrophs compared with undisturbed. Fingerprinting of the carbon (via stable isotopes) suggested that the contribution of autochthonous carbon (carbon produced through plant primary production) to the soil carbon pool was less in disturbed areas compared with seagrass and recovered areas. Seagrass areas that had recovered from disturbance had slightly lower (35%) carbon levels than undisturbed, but more than twice as much as the disturbed areas,which is encouraging for restoration efforts. Slow rates of seagrass recovery imply the need to transplant seagrass, rather than waiting for recovery via natural processes. This study empirically demonstrates that disturbance to seagrass ecosystems can cause release of ancient carbon, with potentially major global warming consequences.

TI  - Blue carbon stocks in Baltic Sea eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows
AB  - Although seagrasses cover only a minor fraction of the ocean seafloor, their carbon sink capacity accounts for nearly one-fifth of the total oceanic carbon burial and thus play a critical structural and functional role in many coastal ecosystems. We sampled 10 eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows in Finland and 10 in Denmark to explore seagrass carbon stocks (C-org stock) and carbon accumulation rates (C-org accumulation) in the Baltic Sea area. The study sites represent a gradient from sheltered to exposed locations in both regions to reflect expected minimum and maximum stocks and accumulation. The C-org stock integrated over the top 25 cm of the sediment averaged 627 g C m(-2) in Finland, while in Denmark the average C-org stock was over 6 times higher (4324 g Cm-2). A conservative estimate of the total organic carbon pool in the regions ranged between 6.98 and 44.9 t C ha(-1). Our results suggest that the Finnish eelgrass meadows are minor carbon sinks compared to the Danish meadows, and that majority of the C-org produced in the Finnish meadows is exported. Our analysis further showed that >40\% of the variation in the C-org stocks was explained by sediment characteristics, i.e. dry density, porosity and silt content. In addition, our analysis show that the root : shoot ratio of Z. marina explained >12\% and the contribution of Z. marina detritus to the sediment surface C-org pool explained >10\% of the variation in the C-org stocks. The mean monetary value for the present carbon storage and carbon sink capacity of eelgrass meadows in Finland and Denmark, were 281 and 1809 EUR ha(-1), respectively. For a more comprehensive picture of seagrass carbon storage capacity, we conclude that future blue carbon studies should, in a more integrative way, investigate the interactions between sediment biogeochemistry, seascape structure, plant species architecture and the hydrodynamic regime.

TI  - Beyond habitat boundaries: Organic matter cycling requires a system-wide approach for accurate blue carbon accounting
AB  - As coastal ecosystems become widely recognized for their capacity to sequester carbon (blue carbon), standard accounting methodologies for the generation of carbon credits are being developed. To ensure the applicability of these standards across blue carbon ecosystems, we investigated organic carbon provenance and burial in salt marshes and seagrass meadows of an arid, upwelling-dominated Eastern Pacific lagoon. We found low carbon density in benthic sediments of Bahia de San Quintin (5.9 +/- 0.5 mg C cm(-3)), only marginally higher in Zostera marina beds (6.9 +/- 0.5 mg C cm(-3)), likely due to remineralization and hydrodynamically driven export of seagrass material, resulting in low carbon burial rates (4.5 +/- 2.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Sediment organic carbon is mainly controlled by the fraction of fine sediment and its source is largely allochthonous, although sources differ spatially. Salt marshes at San Quintin derive 40\% of their organic matter from autochthonous material and exhibit higher carbon burial rates (up to 414.7 +/- 28.6 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and sediment carbon densities (32.0 +/- 0.7 mg C cm(-3)) compared to benthic sediments. This study emphasizes the connectivity of blue carbon habitats with marsh plant detritus supplementing benthic carbon burial and incorporation of detrital eelgrass in marsh sediments. Our findings highlight the importance of allochthonous organic matter for carbon sequestration in blue carbon habitats, suggesting standard accounting practices that deduct allochthonous organic matter would miss the full potential for carbon burial.

TI  - Effect of explosive shallow hydrothermal vents on delta C-13 and growth performance in the seagrass Posidonia oceanica
AB  - 1. Explosive volcanic submarine activity is expected to affect seagrass communities due to sudden and dramatic changes in the physical and chemical features of sea water and sediments, with possibly large ecosystem effects. However, seagrass response to the harsh environmental conditions that arise due to explosive volcanism is as yet unexplored as it is not easy to predict when and where an eruption will occur. Here, we investigate the uptake of hydrothermal carbon within the seagrass Posidonia oceanica by the analysis of delta C-13 and growth rates in tissue laid down before and after an exceptional and massive hydrothermal gas release in the Aeolian Islands (Italy, Mediterranean Sea). 2. Hydrothermal submarine activity was recorded by P. oceanica, which showed a large and persistent C-13-depletion in both scales and rhizomes in the site close to the eruption. Both increased CO2 availability and reduced carbon demand, as a consequence of stressful environmental conditions (e.g. light limitation due to turbidity, high temperature), combined to give much lower delta C-13 signatures. Our results suggest that the explosive volcanism caused physiological stress in the seagrass, leading to a reduction in productivity, whereas slower, more diffuse release of hydrothermal CO2 is known to enhance seagrass productivity. 3. Synthesis. We analysed the effect of a sudden and large hydrothermal event on delta C-13 interannual variations and growth of the seagrass P. oceanica. Our results confirm that shallow submarine hydrothermal vents can be used as natural laboratories for exploring biological responses to acute and often extreme environmental conditions. P. oceanica can record geological events by capturing CO2 derived from vent systems, with implications for habitat management to mitigate against raising CO2 levels and ocean acidification. This leads the way to further studies to evaluate the effects of hydrothermal carbon on shallow ecosystems.

TI  - Future seagrass beds: Can increased productivity lead to increased carbon storage?
AB  - While carbon capture and storage (CCS) is increasingly recognised as technologically possible, recent evidence from deep-sea CCS activities suggests that leakage from reservoirs may result in highly CO2 impacted biological communities. In contrast, shallow marine waters have higher primary productivity which may partially mitigate this leakage. We used natural CO2 seeps in shallow marine waters to assess if increased benthic primary productivity could capture and store CO2 leakage in areas targeted for CCS. We found that the productivity of seagrass communities (in situ, using natural CO2 seeps) and two individual species (ex situ, Cymodocea serrulata and Halophila ovalis) increased with CO2 concentration, but only species with dense belowground biomass increased in abundance (e.g. C serrulata). Importantly, the ratio of below:above ground biomass of seagrass communities increased fivefold, making seagrass good candidates to partially mitigate CO2 leakage from sub-seabed reservoirs, since they form carbon sinks that can be buried for millennia.

TI  - Using Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to Map Seagrass Cover from Sentinel-2 Imagery
AB  - Seagrass habitats are ecologically valuable and play an important role in sequestering and storing carbon. There is, thus, a need to estimate seagrass percentage cover in diverse environments in support of climate change mitigation, marine spatial planning and coastal zone management. In situ approaches are accurate but time-consuming, expensive and may not represent the larger spatial units collected by satellite imaging. Hence, there is a need for a consistent methodology that uses accurate point-based field surveys to deliver high-quality mapping of percentage seagrass cover at large spatial scales. Here, we develop a three-step approach that combines in situ (quadrats), aerial (unoccupied aerial vehicle-UAV) and satellite data to map percentage seagrass cover at Turneffe Atoll, Belize, the largest atoll in the northern hemisphere. First, the optical bands of four UAV images were used to calculate seagrass cover, in combination with in situ data. The seagrass cover calculated from the UAV was then used to develop training and validation datasets to estimate seagrass cover in Sentinel-2 pixels. Next, non-seagrass areas were identified in the Sentinel-2 data and removed by object-based classification, followed by a pixel-based regression to calculate seagrass percentage cover. Using this approach, percentage seagrass cover was mapped using UAVs (R-2 = 0.91 between observed and mapped distributions) and using Sentinel-2 data (R-2 = 0.73). This work provides the first openly available and explorable map of seagrass percentage cover across Turneffe Atoll, where we estimate approximately 242 km(2) of seagrass above 10\% cover is located. We estimate that this approach offers 30 times more data for training satellite data than traditional methods, therefore presenting a substantial reduction in cost-per-point for data. Furthermore, the increase in data helps deliver a high-quality seagrass cover map, suitable for resolving trends of deteriorating, stable or recovering seagrass environments at 10 m(2) resolution to underpin evidence-based management and conservation of seagrass.

TI  - Interspecific differences in root exudation for three tropical seagrasses and sediment pore-water dissolved organic carbon beneath them
AB  - Seagrass beds act as blue carbon sinks globally; however, little attention has been given to carbon dynamics in the seagrass rhizosphere. Hence, in this study, the quantity and characteristics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from root exudation of the three dominant tropical seagrasses (Thalassia hemprichii, Enhalus acoroides, and Cymodocea rotundata) and sediment pore water beneath them were compared, to examine their interspecific differences, and to establish a connection between seagrass root exudation and sediment carbon. The rate of root exuded DOC from T. hemprichii (2.15 +/- 1.06 mg g DW root(-1) h(-1)) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that from E. acoroides (0.72 +/- 0.39 mg g DW root(-1) h(-1)) and C. rotundata (0.46 +/- 0.25 mg g DW root(-1) h(-1)). Root exudation rates were more affected by root hair density and root hair length than by root carbon, nitrogen, and soluble sugar content. Simultaneously, DOC concentrations of the sediment pore water beneath T. hemprichii, E. acoroides and C. rotundata were 22.05 +/- 11.61 mg l(-1), 15.55 +/- 2. 66 mg l(-1), and 14.32 +/- 1.82 mg l(-1), respectively. The corresponding absorption coefficients at 254 nm (a(254)) were 30.53 +/- 18.00, 17.31 +/- 2.24, and 14.07 +/- 2.03, respectively, while the relevant specific ultraviolet absorbances at 254 nm (SUVA(254)) were 1.38 +/- 0.29, 1.19 +/- 0.26 and 1.03 +/- 0.28, respectively. Therefore, the roots of T. hemprichii exuded DOC at a higher rate, leading to a higher pore-water DOC pool in the sediment. This suggests that T. hemprichii played a greater role in the sediment carbon pool through root exudation. Thus, it can be considered as the priority species for transplantation to promote the carbon sink function of seagrass beds.

TI  - The Posidonia oceanica Matte: A reservoir of environmental information
AB  - Seagrass meadows have long been recognized for their high ecological and economic value. More recently, a potential role in climate regulation due to their ability to fix and sequester carbon has been the focus of intensive study. In the Mediterranean Sea, the matte, a specific structure constructed by the seagrass Posidonia oceanica is of particular interest because it keeps buried for thousands of years massive amounts of carbon. In order to study construction process of the matte and to quantify the carbon stocks it sequesters, 12 cores (mean: 2.0 m, maximum: 3.6 m height) were taken at the Natura 2000 site of the Grand Herbier de la CÃ´te Orientale in Corsica. Samples were taken at 10 to 40 m water depth using a Kullenberg corer during the CARBONSINK oceanographic cruise aboard R/V Lâ€ŸEurope (August 2018). The actual matte thickness was compared with HR seismic reflection data for calibration and to characterize the organic carbon content. The mean thickness of the matte was estimated to be 2.1 m and 3 626 years BP old, yielding a mean accretion rate of 0.58 mm year-1. However, the average accretion rate, based on steady matte growth, does not always correspond to reality and several interruptions of growth were observed within the matte structure. The matte constitutes a valuable biological archive containing information regarding the evolution of both the terrestrial and the coastal Corsican ecosystems. Charcoal fragments or pollen grains are some examples of proxies stored in the matte that, in these cases, can provide information on fire episodes in Corsica or on long-term changes in the vegetation on the island, respectively.

TI  - Carbon sequestration and storage in Norwegian Arctic coastal wetlands: Impacts of climate change
AB  - Coastal wetlands contain some of the largest stores of pedologic and biotic carbon pools, and climate change is likely to influence the ability of these ecosystems to sequester carbon. Recent studies have attempted to provide data on carbon sequestration in both temperate and tropical coastal wetlands. Alteration of Arctic wetland carbon sequestration rates is also likely where coastal forcing mechanisms interact directly with these coastal systems. At present there are no data available to provide a detailed understanding of present day and historical carbon sequestration rates within Arctic coastal wetlands. In order to address this knowledge gap, rates of carbon sequestration were assessed within five Arctic coastal wetland sites in Norway. This was undertaken using radiometric dating techniques (210Pb and 137Cs) to establish a geochronology for recent wetland development, and soil carbon stocks were estimated from cores. Average carbon sequestration rates were varied, both between sites and over time, ranging between 19 and 603 g C m2 yâˆ’1, and these were correlated with increases in the length of the growing season. Stocks ranged between 3.67 and 13.79 Mg C haâˆ’1, which is very low compared with global average estimations for similar coastal systems, e.g. 250 Mg C haâˆ’1 for temperate salt marshes, 280 Mg C haâˆ’1 for mangroves, and 140 Mg C haâˆ’1 for seagrasses. This is most likely due to isostatic uplift and sediment accretion historically outpacing sea level rise, which results in wetland progradation and thus a continuous formation of new marsh with thin organic soil horizons. However, with increasing rates of sea level rise it is uncertain whether this trend is set to continue or be reversed. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Critical offshore field development projects-why work outside of strict timelines?
AB  - Overcoming environmental challenges to develop offshore oil fields remains daunting for engineers who must balance economic feasibility with environmental protection, often within limited timelines before first oil commitments. A critical examination of Saudi Arabia's field development cases reveals a 56-year timeline (which seems interminable) between offshore field discovery in 1957 and realization of an environmentally friendly field development in 2013. If teams desire to accomplish Aegian projects with the sustenance of core values in perspective (whatever the core values might be), such as to gain the economic advantages of offshore projects while preserving the environment or honoring some other constraint, it is imperative to work with more robust timelines. Whereas strictly time-bounding projects may help with releasing adrenalin for performance, engineers may require adequate time for innovative concept designs to conduct necessary pilots and qualification. Collaboration between cross-functional project teams-construction, drilling, testing, and production-is examined from the economic delivery of several challenging wells under various environmental challenges and constraints. An overarching theme from each team was to apply environmental solutions. Colonization of hard coral species and presence of several fish species were observed on project completion. For example, a 70% increase in growth of Seagrass and artificial coral reefs was observed near the causeway built for the Manifa Field, which could become a hot spot of biodiversity. Water circulation, as measured by an acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) improved from 17 days before the project to 11 days on project completion. When engineers persevere, collaborate and have enough time to plan intensively until they find the technology solutions to advance, society benefits from an environmental return. As the worldwide study cases reveal, several projects are threatened globally because engineers may be unable to find viable solutions under rigid timelines. Often companies must be willing to wait until they acquire the technologies to responsibly advance complex environmentally sensitive projects. If timelines are flexible and sufficiently realistic, management's unwavering support to avail necessary resources would be critical for success. Â© 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Marine habitats in one of the world's busiest harbours
AB  - Singapore's limited marine territory of approximately 600 km2 supports one of the world's busiest harbours. Over 133,000 vessels (above 75 gross tonnes) called at the port in 2004. Thirty-five percent comprised regional ferries linking Singapore with various ports of Indonesia's Riau province. Other vessels were mainly containers and tankers which facilitate movement of 1 billion gross tonnes of cargo through the port. To accommodate such intense shipping activity and provide safe navigation to the heavy vessel traffic, the port waters cover 82% of Singapore territorial waters. Most of the port provisions are located in the seas south of the main island, particularly the south-western sector (Figure 1). Wharf and berthing facilities dominate the southwestern coastline, which have been transformed by coastal reclamation. Fairways, anchorages and vessel manoeuvring areas intermesh between the fifty-odd smaller offshore islands scattered mostly in the southern waters. A spectrum of marine habitats typical of tropical regimes is found in this heavily utilized marine environment. Fringing and patch reefs are present among the southern islands together with seagrass meadows and mangrove stands, all varying in areal extent. A range of seashore types including rocky, sandy and muddy exists. The seafloor is now mostly dominated by mud bottoms as most of the sand deposits have been exhausted for reclamation while the continuous rain of suspended sediment adds more silt. Threats from shipping include vessel movement, grounding and accidental spillage of hazardous materials. Other activities such as land reclamation, seabed dredging and the dumping of dredged spoils contribute to increased suspended sediment, modification of hydrodynamic patterns and changed tidal speeds at different locations. High energy wash from increasing numbers and operating frequency of fast-going vessels such as high-speed passenger ferries scour exposed shores and reef flats. Large tracts of razed corals on reef flats provide evidence of grounding by flat-bottom barges, often connected with a nearby development activity. The spillage of 28,500 tonnes of heavy marine fuel oil into the sea (figure presented) resulting from the collision of two oil tankers, the "Evoikos" and the "Orapin Global" in October 1997, the largest in Singapore's history, firmly emphasised that this ever-present threat can happen at anytime even under fine weather conditions and with sufficient warning given to the approaching vessels. In August 2000 and July 2001, two separate incidents of phenol spills occurred in the Malaysian waters of the east Johor Straits, killing fish and mussels in Singapore waters as well. Both resulted from capsized cargo vessels transporting the toxic chemical from the Malaysian port of Pasir Gudang. Shipping also introduces the problem of invasive species. The exotic Mytilopsis sallei, which is of Caribbean origin, is now the most commonly-occurring bivalve in Singapore (Sachidhanandam and Chou, 1996), dominating walls of intertidal monsoon canals. Tolerant of large salinity fluctuations, they were possibly introduced by ships coming from across the Panama Canal (Tan and Chou, 2000). Imposex in females of muricid gastropods indicate organotin contamination, which is not surprising considering the shipping intensity (Tan, 1999). Exposed to the diversity of impacts, Singapore's marine habitats face three major problems: habitat loss, habitat degradation and habitat modification.

TI  - Global warming enhances sulphide stress in a key seagrass species (NW Mediterranean)
AB  - The build-up of sulphide concentrations in sediments, resulting from high inputs of organic matter and the mineralization through sulphate reduction, can be lethal to the benthos. Sulphate reduction is temperature dependent, thus global warming may contribute to even higher sulphide concentrations and benthos mortality. The seagrass Posidonia oceanica is very sensitive to sulphide stress. Hence, if concentrations build up with global warming, this key Mediterranean species could be seriously endangered. An 8-year monitoring of daily seawater temperature, the sulphur isotopic signatures of water (S-34(water)), sediment (S-34(CRS)) and P. oceanica leaf tissue (S-34(leaves)), along with total sulphur in leaves (TSleaves) and annual net population growth along the coast of the Balearic archipelago (Western Mediterranean) allowed us to determine if warming triggers P. oceanica sulphide stress and constrains seagrass survival. From the isotopic S signatures, we estimated sulphide intrusion into the leaves (F-sulphide) and sulphur incorporation into the leaves from sedimentary sulphides (SSleaves). We observed lower S-34(leaves), higher F-sulphide and SSleaves coinciding with a 6-year period when two heat waves were recorded. Warming triggered sulphide stress as evidenced by the negative temperature dependence of S-34(leaves) and the positive one of F-sulphide, TSleaves and SSleaves. Lower P. oceanica net population growth rates were directly related to higher contents of TSleaves. At equivalent annual maximum sea surface water temperature (SSTmax), deep meadows were less affected by sulphide intrusion than shallow ones. Thus, water depth acts as a protecting mechanism against sulphide intrusion. However, water depth would be insufficient to buffer seagrass sulphide stress triggered by Mediterranean seawater summer temperatures projected for the end of the 21st century even under scenarios of moderate greenhouse gas emissions, A1B. Mediterranean warming, therefore, is expected to enhance P. oceanica sulphide stress, and thus compromise the survival of this key habitat along its entire depth distribution range.

TI  - A national approach to greenhouse gas abatement through blue carbon management
AB  - There is increasing interest in protecting, restoring and creating `blue carbon' ecosystems (BCE; mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses) to sequester atmospheric CO2-C and thereby contribute to climate change mitigation. While a growing number of countries aspire to report greenhouse gas emission and carbon sequestration changes from these ecosystems under voluntary international reporting requirements, few countries have domestic policy frameworks that specifically support the quantification and financing of carbon emission abatement through BCE management. Australia, as home to approximately 5-11\% of global blue carbon stocks, has a substantial interest in the development of blue carbon policy. Here we assess the potential inclusion of blue carbon within Australia's Emissions Reduction Fund, emphasizing issues and approaches that have global relevance. We used a participatory workshop of scientific experts and carbon industry stakeholders to identify blue carbon management actions that would meet the requirements of the Fund. In total, twelve actions were assessed for their greenhouse gas emission abatement potential and the ability to measure abatement reliably, using a combination of available data and qualitative and quantitative methods, including expert knowledge. We identify and discuss the five most relevant and promising activities, encompassing the protection, restoration and creation of mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses. On a per area basis, mean abatement intensity of organic carbon (C-org) was highest for the (re)introduction of tidal flow resulting in establishment of mangrove (13-15 Mg C-org ha(-1) yr(-1)) and tidal marsh (6-8 Mg C-org ha(-1) yr(-1)), followed by land use planning for sea-level rise for the creation of new mangrove habitat (8 Mg C-org ha(-1) yr(-1)). The avoided disturbance of existing mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses has the twofold benefit of avoiding remineralisation of existing stocks, plus the future annual abatement associated with the net sequestration of atmospheric CO2-C as C-org with the continued functioning of these BCE. Our approach offers a template that uses best available information to identify options for carbon abatement through management of coastal landscapes, and details current knowledge gaps and important technical aspects that need to be considered for implementation in carbon crediting schemes.

TI  - Carbon cycling and bacterial carbon sources in pristine and impacted Mediterranean seagrass sediments
AB  - Stable carbon-isotope ratios of bacterial biomarkers were studied in Mediterranean seagrass meadows and macroalgae communities to identify the sources of organic carbon used by the sediment bacteria. Bacteria delta(13)C ratios in pristine sediments vegetated by the seagrass Posidonia oceanica were either similar to the seagrass signal or slightly enriched, suggesting that seagrass detritus was of major importance as a bacterial carbon source. There was a shift in bacterial carbon sources in anthropogenic impacted P. oceanica meadows towards seston and macroalgae. The net primary productivity was reduced in these meadows, whereas the rates of mineralization as measured by sulfate reduction rates were enhanced in the sediments. This effect on mineralization was probably due to the input of less refractory organic matter compared to seagrass detritus, which enhances the bacterial decomposition of organic matter. In the fast growing seagrass Cymodocea nodosa meadow, the bacterial carbon sources consisted of a mixture of seagrass detritus and seston, and the mineralization rates were much higher compared to the P. oceanica meadows, indicating that these carbon sources were more labile and easily decomposed by the bacteria. A similar pattern was found in the macroalgae bed with Caulerpa prolifera, where the rates of mineralization were high, similar to findings in organic impacted fish farm sediments. Here C. prolifera detritus was the most important carbon source and accounted for an increase in sediment organic content. The possible impacts of a shift in bacterial carbon sources due to nutrient loading are discussed in relation to the performance of P. oceanica in carbonate sediments.

TI  - Does Ocean Acidification Benefit Seagrasses in a Mesohaline Environment? A Mesocosm Experiment in the Northern Gulf of Mexico
AB  - Ocean acidification is thought to benefit seagrasses because of increased carbon dioxide (CO2) availability for photosynthesis. However, in order to truly assess ecological responses, effects of ocean acidification need to be investigated in a variety of coastal environments. We tested the hypothesis that ocean acidification would benefit seagrasses in the northern Gulf of Mexico, where the seagrassesHalodule wrightiiandRuppia maritimacoexist in a fluctuating environment. To evaluate if benefits of ocean acidification could alter seagrass bed composition, cores ofH. wrightiiandR. maritimawere placed alone or in combination into aquaria and maintained in an outdoor mesocosm. Half of the aquaria were exposed to either ambient (mean pH of 8.1 +/- 0.04 SD on total scale) or high CO2(mean pH 7.7 +/- 0.05 SD on total scale) conditions. After 54 days of experimental exposure, the delta C-13 values were significantly lower in seagrass tissue in the high CO(2)condition. This integration of a different carbon source (either: preferential use of CO2, gas from cylinder, or both) indicates that plants were not solely relying on stored energy reserves for growth. Yet, after 41 to 54 days, seagrass morphology, biomass, photo-physiology, metabolism, and carbon and nitrogen content in the high CO(2)condition did not differ from those at ambient. There was also no indication of differences in traits between the homospecific or heterospecific beds. Findings support two plausible conclusions: (1) these seagrasses rely heavily on bicarbonate use and growth will not be stimulated by near future acidification conditions or (2) the mesohaline environment limited the beneficial impacts of increased CO(2)availability.

TI  - A Global Assessment of the Chemical Recalcitrance of Seagrass Tissues: Implications for Long-Term Carbon Sequestration
AB  - Seagrass ecosystems have recently been identified for their role in climate change mitigation due to their globally-significant carbon sinks; yet, the capacity of seagrasses to sequester carbon has been shown to vary greatly among seagrass ecosystems. The recalcitrant nature of seagrass tissues, or the resistance to degradation back into carbon dioxide, is one aspect thought to influence sediment carbon stocks. In this study, a global survey investigated how the macromolecular chemistry of seagrass leaves, sheaths/stems, rhizomes and roots varied across 23 species from 16 countries. The goal was to understand how this seagrass chemistry might influence the capacity of seagrasses to contribute to sediment carbon stocks. Three non-destructive analytical chemical analyses were used to investigate seagrass chemistry: thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and solid state C-13-NMR and infrared spectroscopy. A strong latitudinal influence on carbon quality was found, whereby temperate seagrasses contained 5\% relatively more labile carbon, and tropical seagrasses contained 3\% relatively more refractory carbon. Sheath/stem tissues significantly varied across taxa, with larger morphologies typically containing more refractory carbon than smaller morphologies. Rhizomes were characterized by a higher proportion of labile carbon (16\% of total organic matter compared to 8-10\% in other tissues); however, high rhizome biomass production and slower remineralization in anoxic sediments will likely enhance these below-ground tissues' contributions to long-termcarbon stocks. Our study provides a standardized and global dataset on seagrass carbon quality across tissue types, taxa and geography that can be incorporated in carbon sequestration and storage models as well as ecosystem valuation and management strategies.

TI  - The value of information: Realising the economic benefits of mapping seagrass meadows in the British Virgin Islands
AB  - Carbon capturing coastal and marine habitats around the world are decreasing in extent every year, habitats found in abundance in Small Island Developing States' territories. However, these habitats are under threat by increased levels of economic activities and extreme weather events. Consequently, as those ecosystems become scarce their value is expected to increase. In this paper the â€œvalue of informationâ€, the increase in knowledge that renders a system or a function more valuable, from marine habitat mapping is presented through the (monetary) valuation of one regulating service provided by the newly mapped habitats. Mapping a section of a channel with a multibeam echosounder revealed more seagrass resources than in previous studies. Using values for both the Social Cost of Carbon and Abatement Cost methods, from the literature we estimate the value of the carbon sequestration and storage service these seagrass meadows provide. The impacts of hurricanes in the newly mapped seagrasses were also investigated. Despite the costs of mapping, monitoring and of projected losses of ecosystem services provision due to hurricanes, net benefits over a time period of 50 years were considerably larger. The new information provided highlights carbon capturing habitats as more important, enabling the â€œvalue of informationâ€ to inform policymaking. Â© 2018

TI  - Vascular Plants Are Globally Significant Contributors to Marine Carbon Fluxes and Sinks
AB  - More than two-thirds of global biomass consists of vascular plants. A portion of the detritus they generate is carried into the oceans from land and highly productive blue carbon ecosystems-salt marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows. This large detrital input receives scant attention in current models of the global carbon cycle, though for blue carbon ecosystems, increasingly well-constrained estimates of biomass, productivity, and carbon fluxes, reviewed in this article, are now available. We show that the fate of this detritus differs markedly from that of strictly marine origin, because the former contains lignocellulose-an energy-rich polymer complex of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin that is resistant to enzymatic breakdown. This complex can be depolymerized for nutritional purposes by specialized marine prokaryotes, fungi, protists, and invertebrates using enzymes such as glycoside hydrolases and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases to release sugar monomers. The lignin component, however, is less readily depolymerized, and detritus therefore becomes lignin enriched, particularly in anoxic sediments, and forms a major carbon sink in blue carbon ecosystems. Eventual lignin breakdown releases a wide variety of small molecules that may contribute significantly to the oceanic pool of recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon. Marine carbon fluxes and sinks dependent on lignocellulosic detritus are important ecosystem services that are vulnerable to human interventions. These services must be considered when protecting blue carbon ecosystems and planning initiatives aimed at mitigating anthropogenic carbon emissions. Â© 2020 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation of the baseline carbon sequestration rates of Indo-Pacific temperate and tropical seagrass meadow sediments
AB  - Seagrass meadows have great capacity to sequester and store organic carbon (OC) in sediments for the long term and have been considered as a carbon dioxide sink for national greenhouse gas inventories in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines. Therefore, there is an urgent need to determine a reliable, well-constrained estimate of the baseline long-term OC sequestration (burial) rate in seagrass meadows, evaluate its spatial and temporal variability, and understand the mechanisms that control the variability. Here, we report data on OC stocks and long-term sequestration rates for 14 selected sediment cores collected from temperate and tropical seagrass meadows and adjacent bare areas in Japan and Thailand. We also tested several different radiocarbon dating calibration methods to evaluate sedimentation rates and identified potential complicating factors. The estimated OC sequestration rate ranged from 3.7 to 161 kg C ha(-1) year(-1), which is generally lower and less variable than reported global representative values, presumably because of differences in the time scale considered. The OC sequestration rate for temperate seagrass meadows was correlated with the average specific surface area of sediment, implying that geophysical and hydrodynamic factors constrain the long-term OC sequestration rate. The baseline OC sequestration rate may be better constrained by the method used here, focusing on time scales of centuries to millennia, while the evaluation of OC sequestration on shorter time scales may be more suitable for assessing the environmental additionality of climate mitigation efforts based on blue carbon manipulation.

TI  - Carbon sources supporting benthic mineralization in mangrove and adjacent seagrass sediments (Gazi Bay, Kenya)
AB  - The origin of carbon substrates used by in situ sedimentary bacterial communities was investigated in an intertidal mangrove ecosystem and in adjacent seagrass beds in Gazi bay (Kenya) by delta C-13 analysis of bacteria-specific PLFA (phospholipid fatty acids) and bulk organic carbon. Export of mangrove-derived organic matter to the adjacent seagrass-covered bay was evident from sedimentary total organic carbon (TOC) and delta C-13(TOC) data. PLFA delta C-13 data indicate that the substrate used by bacterial communities varied strongly and that exported mangrove carbon was a significant source for bacteria in the adjacent seagrass beds. Within the intertidal mangrove forest, bacterial PLFA at the surface layer (0-1 cm) typically showed more enriched delta C-13 values than deeper (up to 10 cm) sediment layers, suggesting a contribution from microphytobenthos and/or inwelled seagrass material. Under the simplifying assumption that seagrasses and mangroves are the dominant potential end-members, the estimated contribution of mangrove-derived carbon to benthic mineralization in the seagrass beds (16-74\%) corresponds fairly well to the estimated contribution of mangrove C to the sedimentary organic matter pool (21-71\%) across different seagrass sites. Based on the results of this study and a compilation of literature data, we suggest that trapping of allochtonous C is a common feature in seagrass beds and often represents a significant source of C for sediment bacteria - both in cases where seagrass C dominates the sediment TOC pool and in cases where external inputs are significant. Hence, it is likely that data on community respiration rates systematically overestimate the role of in situ mineralization as a fate of seagrass production.

TI  - Variability in the origin of carbon substrates for bacterial communities in mangrove sediments
AB  - Organic carbon in mangrove sediments originates from both local sources (mangroves, microphytobenthos) and tidal inputs (e.g. phytoplankton, seagrass-derived material). The relative inputs of these sources may vary strongly, both within and between different mangrove sites. We combined elemental (TOC/TN) and bulk Î´13C analysis on sediment cores from various mangrove sites with Î´13C data of bacteria-specific phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) in order to identify the dominant carbon substrates used by in situ bacterial communities. Î´13C values of each of these markers showed a range of 10â€° or more across the different sites and sampling depths, but generally followed the Î´13C trend observed in bulk organic carbon. Several sediment cores show a strong vertical gradient in PLFA Î´13C, suggesting a selectivity for algal-derived carbon in the surface layers. Our data demonstrate that the origin of bacterial carbon substrates varies widely across different mangrove sites, and imply that data on mineralization of organic matter cannot be directly incorporated in ecosystem carbon budgets without an estimation of the contribution of various sources.

TI  - Local geomorphological gradients affect sedimentary organic carbon storage: A Blue Carbon case study from sub-tropical Australia
AB  - Coastal blue carbon systems (mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and tidal saltmarshes) are renowned for their efficacy at sequestering large amounts of carbon (C) in sedimentary sinks and effective management action to preserve these C stocks requires an understanding of spatial variability within an estuary. This study analysed 33 coastal blue carbon sediment cores across three subtropical estuaries of Eastern Australia. We measured depth, C content and dry bulk density down the soil profile. Mean C stocks for mangroves, seagrass and saltmarsh, up to a 3 metre depth, were estimated to be 738 +/- 119, 439 +/- 72, and 823 +/- 138 Mg C ha(-1), respectively. Linear regression models showed the relationship between distance from ocean and C stocks was significant in mangroves and saltmarsh (p <= 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively), with the exception of mangroves in an urbanised estuary which displayed the inverse. The differences we observed in C stocks in mangroves and saltmarsh, not seagrass, in relation to location within the estuary may have important implications for management actions and ecological processes.

TI  - Assessing Carbon Stock and Sequestration of the Tropical Seagrass Meadows in Indonesia
AB  - Seagrass meadows provide critical ecosystem services for coastal areas, e.g., as nursery habitats for various fish species, help with water filtration of suspended sediment, and provide food for dugongs (Dugong dugon). Their role as â€œblue carbonâ€ and their capacity to mitigate climate change, by means of Natural mechanism of Carbon Dioxide Removal (NCDR) from the atmosphere, has recently gained increased attention. However, available scientific methods such as guidelines and manuals to measure carbon stock and sequestration still rely heavily on field sampling activities and laboratory analyses. Despite their accuracy, neither of these methods are applicable for large-scale carbon inventories nor are they practical in areas with limited carbon-related data and laboratory resources. Thus, it is necessary to determine whether any of the seagrass-related variables (e.g., coverage, density and biomass) may be treated as a proxy that are both robust and practical to assess the capacity of seagrass to store and sequester carbon. We developed formulas, assessed their robustness, and used both the formulas and the proxy to estimate carbon stock and the sequestration potential of the seagrasses. Furthermore, this study aims to elucidate the carbon stock and sequestration potential capacity of the seagrass ecosystems in Indonesia. We used the data of seagrass- and carbon-related variables obtained from eleven study sites and developed several candidate formulas using the Robust Linear Mixed Models (rL MMs). We found that the best formulas are comprised of multiple seagrass-related variables that consistently include biomass and coverage. This suggests that a combination of biomass and coverage is the best proxy to estimate carbon stock; however, a single proxy of seagrass coverage is recommended for practical seagrass monitoring purposes by the local government. Estimations of carbon stock and sequestration subsequently follow the formulas in the present study. Here we estimated, using a single proxy of seagrass coverage, that the above- and below-ground carbon stock, and carbon sequestration capacity of seagrass ecosystems in Indonesia reached 80â€“314 ktC, 196â€“696 ktC, and 1.6â€“7.4 MtC/year, respectively.

TI  - Muddy Waters: Unintentional Consequences of Blue Carbon Research Obscure Our Understanding of Organic Carbon Dynamics in Seagrass Ecosystems
AB  - The recent surge in research on organic carbon sequestration by seagrass ecosystems has begun to reveal the complexity of the carbon cycle within these ecosystems. In this prospective we discuss two areas of investigation that require further scrutiny: (1) why organic carbon is stabilized in seagrass sediments, and (2) how long organic carbon resides within these sediments. By delving into these topics, pointing out current pitfalls, and highlighting methodological advances, our motive is to focus future efforts and provide a frame work to manage the complexity found within the diverse seagrass bioregions. The high rate of seagrass degradation and loss, coupled with increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations gives precedence to these lines of research, which require rigorous reevaluation if we are to substantially advance our understanding of OC dynamics in seagrass ecosystems.

TI  - Pathways for Understanding Blue Carbon Microbiomes with Amplicon Sequencing
AB  - The capacity of Blue Carbon Ecosystems to act as carbon sinks is strongly influenced by the metabolism of soil-associated microbes, which ultimately determine how much carbon is accumulated or returned to the atmosphere. The rapid evolution of sequencing technologies has facilitated the generation of tremendous amounts of data on what taxa comprise belowground microbial assemblages, largely available as isolated datasets, offering an opportunity for synthesis research that informs progress on understanding Blue Carbon microbiomes. We identified questions that can be addressed with a synthesis approach, including the high variability across datasets, space, and time due to differing sampling techniques, ecosystem or vegetation specificity, and the relationship between microbiome community and edaphic properties, particularly soil carbon. To address these questions, we collated 34 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing datasets, including bulk soil or rhizosphere from seagrass, mangroves, and saltmarshes within publicly available repositories. We identified technical and theoretical challenges that precluded a synthesis of multiple studies with currently available data, and opportunities for addressing the knowledge gaps within Blue Carbon microbial ecology going forward. Here, we provide a standardisation toolbox that supports enacting tasks for the acquisition, management, and integration of Blue Carbon-associated sequencing data and metadata to potentially elucidate novel mechanisms behind Blue Carbon dynamics.

TI  - Estimating the Potential Blue Carbon Gains From Tidal Marsh Rehabilitation: A Case Study From South Eastern Australia
AB  - Historically, coastal ``blue carbon{''} ecosystems (tidal marshes, mangrove forests, seagrass meadows) have been impacted and degraded by human intervention, mainly in the form of land acquisition. With increasing recognition of the role of blue carbon ecosystems in climate mitigation, protecting and rehabilitating these ecosystems becomes increasingly more important. This study evaluated the potential carbon gains from rehabilitating a degraded coastal tidal marsh site in south-eastern Australia. Tidal exchange at the study site had been restricted by the construction of earthen barriers for the purpose of reclaiming land for commercial salt production. Analysis of sediment cores (elemental carbon and Pb-210 dating) revealed that the site had stopped accumulating carbon since it had been converted to salt ponds 65 years earlier. In contrast, nearby recovered ({''}control{''}) tidal marsh areas are still accumulating carbon at relatively high rates (0.54 tons C ha(-1) year(-1)). Using elevation and sea level rise (SLR) data, we estimated the potential future distribution of tidal marsh vegetation if the earthen barrier were removed and tidal exchange was restored to the degraded site. We estimated that the sediment-based carbon gains over the next 50 years after restoring this small site (360 ha) would be 9,000 tons C, which could offset the annual emissions of similar to 7,000 passenger cars at present time (at 4.6 metric tons pa.) or similar to 1,400 Australians. Overall, we recommend that this site is a promising prospect for rehabilitation based on the opportunity for blue carbon additionality, and that the business case for rehabilitation could be bolstered through valuation of other co-benefits, such as nitrogen removal, support to fisheries, sediment stabilization, and enhanced biodiversity.

TI  - Blue carbon of Mexico, carbon stocks and fluxes: a systematic review
AB  - Mexico has more than 750,000 ha of mangroves and more than 400,000 ha of seagrasses. However, approximately 200,000 ha of mangroves and an unknown area of seagrass have been lost due to coastal development associated with urban, industrial and tourist purposes. In 2018, the approved reforms to the General Law on Climate Change (LGCC) aligned the Mexican law with the international objectives established in the 2nd Article of the Paris Agreement. This action proves Mexico's commitment to contributing to the global target of stabilizing the greenhouse gas emissions concentration in the planet. Thus, restoring and conserving mangrove and seagrass habitats could contribute to fulfilling this commitment. Therefore, as a first step in establishing a mitigation and adaptation plan against climate change with respect to conservation and restoration actions of these ecosystems, we evaluated Mexican blue carbon ecosystems through a systematic review of the carbon stock using the standardized method of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). We used the data from 126 eligible studies for both ecosystems (n = 1220). The results indicated that information is missing at the regional level. However, the average above and below ground organic carbon stocks from mangroves in Mexico is 113.6 +/- 5.5 (95\% CI {[}99.3-118.4]) Mg C-org ha(-1) and 385.1 +/- 22 (95\% CI {[}344.5 431.9]) Mg C-org ha(-1), respectively. The variability in the C-org stocks for both blue carbon ecosystems in Mexico is related to variations in climate, hydrology and geomorphology observed along the country's coasts in addition to the size and number of plots evaluated with respect to the spatial cover. The highest values for mangroves were related to humid climate conditions, although in the case of seagrasses, they were related to low levels of hydrodynamic stress. Based on the official extent of mangrove and seagrass area in Mexico, we estimate a total carbon stock of 237.7 Tg C-org from mangroves and 48.1 Tg C-org from seagrasses. However, mangroves and seagrasses are still being lost due to land use change despite Mexican laws meant to incorporate environmental compensation. Such losses are largely due to loopholes in the legal framework that dilute the laws' effectiveness and thus ability to protect the ecosystem. The estimated emissions from land use change under a conservative approach in mangroves of Mexico were approximately 24 Tg CO(2)e in the last 20 years. Therefore, the incorporation of blue carbon into the carbon market as a viable source of supplemental finance for mangrove and seagrass protection is an attractive win-win opportunity.

TI  - Variability in Carbon Availability and Eelgrass (Zostera marina) Biometrics Along an Estuarine Gradient in Willapa Bay, WA, USA
AB  - Because photosynthesis requires CO2, carbon limitation in aquatic environments could restrict primary production and provide signals in tissue chemistry. We took advantage of spatial variability of aqueous [}CO2] in estuaries to examine within-estuary variation in biometrics of intertidal eelgrass (Zostera marina) during peak summer production. As expected from the sensitivity of carbonate equilibria to pH, aqueous [}CO2] increased along an ocean-to-river gradient in Willapa Bay, WA, USA. The scale of pH variability also changed, reflecting weather-driven upwelling near the ocean, tidal advection near rivers, and reduced diel fluctuation up-estuary. Z. marina studied at eight sites in the bay integrated across these different temporal fluctuations in water chemistry to exhibit increased tissue carbon and depleted delta C-13 up-estuary. However, seagrass production did not change as expected from aqueous {[}CO2]. Instead, small standing biomass occurred at sites with organic-rich sediments or high wave energy, investment in branching showed trends along the estuarine gradient that changed seasonally, and specific growth rates based on leaf extension did not shift with the estuarine gradient or with standing biomass. These results reinforce that estuarine seagrasses are likely to experience modified mean pH and variability due not only to ocean acidification in the strict sense (anthropogenic CO2 absorbed from the atmosphere) but also from land use, upwelling, and feedbacks from biological processes. However, responses via productivity may be less evident than in tissue chemistry.

TI  - Environmental management of shellsand dredging Owen Anchorage, Western Australia
AB  - Marine carbonate sediments (shellsand) off the coast of Perth, Western Australia are presently being dredged for use in the manufacture of lime and cement. The increase in water depth modifies the wave climate in the adjacent area. In addition, seagrasses occur in some of the areas proposed for dredging. A comprehensive Environmental Management Programme (EMP) has shown that dredging is not adversely affecting shipping and navigation, and that the adjacent shoreline continues to accrete. Further, seagrasses of the area have shown a significant natural increase in density and cover. A major successful development has been transplantation of seagrass in the area.

TI  - Decade of change in Enhalus acoroides seagrass meadows in Guam, Mariana Islands
AB  - Seagrasses provide important ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration. However, there are significant gaps in our estimates of seagrass coverage, particularly in the western tropical Pacific. In the present study we assessed the status and extent of seagrass meadows, dominated by Enhalus acoroides, around Guam, the largest and most populated island in the Marianas. The combined above-and belowground biomass of E. acoroides (similar to 2300 g dry weight m(-2)) is the highest reported for this species and among the highest for all seagrass species. Elemental analysis of C, N and P revealed variations across site and plant part (i.e. above-v. belowground); N:P ratios suggested N limitation. Between 2004 and 2015, seagrass meadows in Guam decreased in total size by 22\%, although it is unclear whether this change was part of a long-term trend and whether it was caused by natural or human factors. The high standing stock of E. acoroides suggests that further examination of this species and this region will be needed to better estimate global seagrass carbon stocks.

TI  - A multiscale approach to seagrass recovery in Tampa Bay, Florida
AB  - Recovery of seagrass coverage in Tampa Bay, Florida, to levels observed in 1950 (15,380 ha) is a long-term goal adopted by local, state, federal, and private partners participating in the Tampa Bay Estuary Program. Nitrogen controls initiated in 1980 and continuing through present (from wastewater treatment facilities, stormwater treatment, fertilizer manufacturers, and power plants) resulted in a 60% total nitrogen load reduction compared to the mid-1970s. As a result, annual water clarity targets (measured as light attenuation and chlorophyll-a concentrations) are being met, and seagrass coverage in 2008 was the highest recorded since 1950 (but still 3,380 ha lower than 1950 coverage). However, seagrass coverage in all areas of the bay is not increasing at the same rate. Wave energy and tidal scour affect longshore sandbars, and in turn seagrass recovery in some areas. Localized water quality factors, including colored dissolved organic matter and turbidity may have impacts on seagrass growth in other areas. Have we had an effect on seagrass recovery in Tampa Bay? Yes, but it will take more than maintaining a successful nutrient management strategy to reach the recovery goal. A multiscale adaptive research and application approach is currently underway to ensure continuation of the upward trend in Tampa Bay seagrass coverage.

TI  - Seagrass organic matter transfer in Posidonia oceanica macrophytodetritus accumulations
AB  - Seagrass ecosystems are net autotrophic systems which contribute to organic carbon burial in marine sediment. Dead seagrass leaves are often exported outside the seagrass beds and may form accumulations (exported macrophytodetritus accumulations, hereafter EMAs) from littoral zones to deepest canyons. Understanding how seagrass organic matter is channeled in its associated trophic web is necessary to assess the role of the seagrass ecosystem as blue carbon service providers. We used gut content and stable isotope analyses to delineate the Posidonia oceanica EMA food web structure and to determine the importance of detrital material in the diets of macrofauna. Evidence from gut contents and stable isotopes showed that this food web is fuelled mainly by two food sources found in the detritus accumulations: 1) P. oceanica detritus itself and 2) epiphytes and drift macroalgae. Dead leaves of P. oceanica enter the diet of dominant species, representing more than 60% of animal abundance. The food web is structured in five trophic levels with a numerical dominance of detritivore/herbivore species at the first consumer level. Animals act as a vector for seagrass organic matter transfer to upper trophic levels and this â€œdead seagrass signalâ€ is followed through the entire food web. Seagrass primary production and seagrass organic matter processing by animals are spatially decoupled and this should be taken into account in assessments of seagrass ecosystems as key actors in C cycles in coastal areas.

TI  - Effects of seagrass overgrazing on sediment erosion and carbon sink capacity: Current understanding and future priorities
AB  - We searched the literature for experimental and observational studies assessing the effects of seagrass overgrazing on erosion of sediment and sedimentary organic carbon (SOC) and found that most studies reported a significant impact, likely caused by a cascading effect (i.e., seagrass shoot loss â†’ belowground biomass degradation â†’ sediment destabilization or SOC erosion). However, there appears to be a clear lack of knowledge on the extent and mechanisms behind SOC erosion in seagrass meadows and we highlight the need for research to (1) define spatial and temporal scales of occurrence; (2) assess the influence of belowground biomass degradation, sediment characteristics, and hydrodynamic exposure on sediment stabilization; and (3) estimate the greenhouse gas emission after a disturbance. Such information would help coastal resource managers to address the causes and effects of SOC loss and sediment erosion when evaluating impacts of global change on coastal ecosystems.

TI  - Uptake and resource allocation of inorganic carbon by the temperate seagrasses Posidonia and Amphibolis
AB  - Productivity measurements from carbon uptake have been suggested as good indicators of the physiological health of seagrasses. As seagrasses acquire carbon from the surrounding water, the rate of uptake often provide a good measure of the efficiency at which seagrasses meet their resource demands for growth. This rate is often used to assess the photosynthetic efficiency of the plants, a proxy for the physiological status of seagrass. This has special relevance to the Adelaide region as over 5000Â ha of seagrasses have been lost from Adelaide coastal waters over the last 70Â years, with much of this loss attributed to nutrient inputs from wastewater, industrial and stormwater discharges. This study used an in-situ inorganic carbon isotope-labelling and spike approach to obtain ecologically relevant estimates of seasonal variability in carbon uptake and its allocation in two species of temperate seagrass common to this coast (Amphibolis antarctica and Posidonia angustifolia). Uptake of carbon by the seagrass complex (leaves, roots, phytoplankton and epiphytes) was affected by both season and species. Carbon uptake rates of phytoplankton were generally higher than other components of the system. Uptake rates ranged from 0.01Â mg C g- 1 DW h- 1 (summer) to 0.61Â mg C g- 1 DW h- 1 (spring) in Posidonia and 0.02Â mg C g- 1 DW h- 1 (summer) to 0.93Â mg C g- 1 DW h- 1 (winter) in Amphibolis. Carbon uptake by the Amphibolis complex was higher than in the Posidonia complex. The Amphibolis complex had higher uptake rates in summer whereas the Posidonia complex was higher in spring. Fine sediments probably from a nearby dredging operation, are likely to have resulted in lower carbon uptake and a reduction in the above-ground and below-ground biomass in summer.

TI  - The economic feasibility of Blue Carbon cooperation in the South China Sea region
AB  - Coastal Blue Carbon is the carbon stored in mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass meadows. There is an urgent need to protect the coastal ecosystem by developing Blue Carbon economy. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility and mechanism of the Blue Carbon cooperation in the South China Sea Region (SCSR) from an economic angle. We utilize the paradigm of Cobb-Douglas production to stimulate Blue Carbon development and mathematically prove the feasibility of such a cooperation strategy. The Shapley value in game theory is further applied, which not only confirms the reality of this cooperation but also provides an allocation mechanism of the cooperation benefits. The results suggest that there exists a profitable opportunity for the Blue Carbon cooperation in the SCSR. Further discussion and suggestions are provided in promotion of research focus on the Blue Carbon cooperation. Â© 2019

TI  - Blue Carbon Ecosystems and Their Role in Climate Change Mitigation-An Overview
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems include mangroves and other tidal wetlands such as seagrasses and salt marshes. Coastal blue carbon is thought to provide climate change mitigation benefits in view of their ability to store carbon under adverse conditions and this in the recent times has garnered the attention of the scientific community at large. Mangroves are one of the most productive ecosystems and their carbon storage potential is much greater as compared to sea grasses and salt marshes. Mangroves sequester carbon in their living biomass as well as the sediments. The tropical Asian mangroves show the greatest mangrove diversity and the highest biomass accumulation. But, the carbon storage potential of their living biomass is outcompeted by their sedimentary carbon storage. Mangrove sediments play a special and quantitatively important role in carbon storage than previously thought. They store both autochthonous and allochthonous organic matter due to their strategic location at the interface between land and sea and prevailing reducing conditions. Indian mangrove ecosystems which also comprises one of the largest mangrove forest of the world may offer a possible opportunity for the development of blue carbon market economy. But there exist a large number of gaps in the available blue carbon literature. The available studies largely focus on the living biomass storage and sedimentary storage is un-surveyed. Mangrove research in India have shown significant growth in the past few decades but the targeted approach towards delineating the ecosystems' carbon stocks and the factors controlling them are still lacking. The need of the hour is to correctly map and document the mangroves in India for their carbon storage in order to build a better and reliable picture of the role of these ecosystems in climate change mitigation.

TI  - The present state-of-the-art of blue carbon repository in India: a meta-analysis
AB  - The present study collated data on the Indian blue carbon repository (mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes) from peer-reviewed literature on carbon stock assessment. This meta-analysis indicated that the blue carbon ecosystems of India could have a collective carbon stock of 67.35 Tg C (mangroves, seagrass, and salt marsh accounting for 67 Tg C, 0.0630 Tg C, and 0.0049 Tg C, respectively). Several studies have ubiquitously measured the spatial extent of mangroves (~ 4991 km2) and seagrasses (~ 517 km2) in India; however, the salt marshes (290â€“1398 km2) have contradictions in estimates. The green payments against the blue carbon ecosystems of India can be as high as ~ 9.6 billion US $, whereas the social cost of carbon sequestered by these ecosystems can vary between 0.47 and 5.43 billion US $. The present study also identified the key research areas that require priority to minimize the uncertainties in blue carbon stock assessment to foster a robust ecosystem-based approach for climate change adaptation in the country. The study identified that less than half of the total mangrove habitats of India are yet to be sampled leaving a scope of substantial uncertainty in nationwide blue carbon estimates. The spatial extent of Indiaâ€™s salt marshes is another aspect that needs to be delineated with a higher confidence level.

TI  - Effects of upwelling, tides and biological processes on the inorganic carbon system of a coastal lagoon in Baja California
AB  - The role of coastal lagoons and estuaries as sources or sinks of inorganic carbon in upwelling areas has not been fully understood. During the months of May-July, 2005, we studied the dissolved inorganic carbon system in a coastal lagoon of northwestern Mexico during the strongest period of upwelling events. Along the bay, different scenarios were observed for the distributions of pH, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) as a result of different combinations of upwelling intensity and tidal amplitude. DIC concentrations in the outer part of the bay were controlled by mixing processes. At the inner part of the bay DIC was as low as 1800 mu mol kg(-1), most likely due to high water residence times and seagrass CO2 uptake. It is estimated that 85\% of San Quintin Bay, at the oceanic end, acted as a source of CO2 to the atmosphere due to the inflow of CO2-rich upwelled waters from the neighboring ocean with high positive fluxes higher than 30 mmol C m(-2) d(-1). In contrast, there was a net uptake of CO2 and HCO3- by the seagrass bed Zostera marina in the inner part of the bay, so the pCO(2) in this zone was below the equilibrium value and slightly negative CO2 fluxes of -6 mmol C m(-2) d(-1). Our positive NEP and Delta DIC values indicate that Bahia San Quintin was a net autotrophic system during the upwelling season during 2005. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Zostera marina L.: Supercritical CO2-Extraction and Mass Spectrometric Characterization of Chemical Constituents Recovered from Seagrass
AB  - Three types of Zostera marina L. collection were extracted using the supercritical CO2-extraction method. For the purposes of supercritical CO2-extraction, old seagrass ejection on the surf edge, fresh seagrass ejection on the surf edge and seagrass collected in water were used. Several experimental conditions were investigated in the pressure range 50-350 bar, with the used volume of co-solvent ethanol in the amount of 1\% in the liquid phase at a temperature in the range of 31-70 degrees C. The most effective extraction conditions are: pressure 250 Bar and temperature 60 degrees C for Z. marina collected in sea water. Z. marina contain various phenolic compounds and sulfated polyphenols with valuable biological activity. Tandem mass-spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-ion trap) was applied to detect target analytes. 77 different biologically active components have been identified in Z. marina supercritical CO2-extracts. 38 polyphenols were identified for the first time in Z. marina.

TI  - Contribution of Seagrass Blue Carbon Toward Carbon Neutral Policies in a Touristic and Environmentally-Friendly Island
AB  - Estimates of organic carbon (C-org) storage by seagrass meadows which consider inter-habitat variability are essential to understand their potential to sequester carbon dioxide (CO2) and derive robust global and regional estimates of blue carbon storage. In this study, we provide baseline estimates of seagrass extent, and soil C-org stocks and accumulation rates from different seagrass habitats at Rottnest Island (in Amphibolis spp., Posidonia spp., Halophila ovalis, and mixed Posidonia/Amphibolis spp. meadows). The C-org stocks in 0.5 m thick seagrass soil deposits, derived from 24 cores, were 5.1 +/- 0.7 kg C-org m(-2) (mean +/- SE, ranging from 0.05 to 12.9 kg C-org m(-2)), accumulating at 23.2 +/- 3.2 g C-org m(-2) year(-1) (ranging from 0.22 to 58.9 g C-org m(-2) year(-1)) over the last decades. There were significant differences in C-org content (\%) and stocks (mg C-org cm(-3)), stable carbon isotope composition of the soil organic matter (delta C-13), and soil grain size among the seagrass meadows studied, highlighting that biotic and abiotic factors influence seagrass soil C-org storage. Mixed meadows of Posidonia/Amphibolis spp. and monospecific meadows of Posidonia spp. and Amphibolis spp. had the highest C-org stocks (ranging from 6.2 to 6.4 kg C-org m(-2)), while Halophila spp. meadows had the lowest C-org stocks (1.2 +/- 0.6 kg C-org m(-2)). We estimated a total soil C-org stock of 48.1 +/- 8.5 Gg C-org beneath the 755 ha of Rottnest Island's seagrasses, and a C-org sequestration capacity of 0.81 +/- 0.06 Gg C-org year(-1), which is equivalent to the sequestration of similar to 22\% of the island's current annual CO2 emissions. Our results contribute to the existing global dataset on seagrass soil C-org storage and show a significant potential of seagrass to sequester CO2, which are particularly relevant in the context of achieving carbon neutrality through conservation actions in environmentally-marketed, tourist destinations such as Rottnest Island.

TI  - A Review of Remote Sensing Approaches for Monitoring Blue Carbon Ecosystems: Mangroves, Seagrasses and Salt Marshes during 2010-2018
AB  - Blue carbon (BC) ecosystems are an important coastal resource, as they provide a range of goods and services to the environment. They play a vital role in the global carbon cycle by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impacts of climate change. However, there has been a large reduction in the global BC ecosystems due to their conversion to agriculture and aquaculture, overexploitation, and removal for human settlements. Effectively monitoring BC ecosystems at large scales remains a challenge owing to practical difficulties in monitoring and the time-consuming field measurement approaches used. As a result, sensible policies and actions for the sustainability and conservation of BC ecosystems can be hard to implement. In this context, remote sensing provides a useful tool for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems faster and at larger scales. Numerous studies have been carried out on various sensors based on optical imagery, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), aerial photographs (APs), and multispectral data. Remote sensing-based approaches have been proven effective for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems by a large number of studies. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review on the applications of remote sensing techniques for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems. The main goal of this review is to provide an overview and summary of the key studies undertaken from 2010 onwards on remote sensing applications for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems. Our review showed that optical imagery, such as multispectral and hyper-spectral data, is the most common for mapping BC ecosystems, while the Landsat time-series are the most widely-used data for monitoring their changes on larger scales. We investigate the limitations of current studies and suggest several key aspects for future applications of remote sensing combined with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for mapping coastal vegetation and monitoring their extents and changes.

TI  - Sedimentary organic carbon and nitrogen stocks of intertidal seagrass meadows in a dynamic and impacted wetland: Effects of coastal infrastructure constructions and meadow establishment time
AB  - Seagrass meadows, through their large capacity to sequester and store organic carbon in their sediments, contribute to mitigate climatic change. However, these ecosystems have experienced large losses and degrada-tion worldwide due to anthropogenic and natural impacts and they are among the most threatened ecosystems on Earth. When a meadow is impacted, the vegetation is partial-or completely lost, and the sediment is exposed to the atmosphere or water column, resulting in the erosion and remineralisation of the carbon stored. This paper addresses the effects of the construction of coastal infrastructures on sediment properties, organic carbon, and total nitrogen stocks of intertidal seagrass meadows, as well as the size of such stocks in relation to meadow establishing time (recently and old established meadows). Three intertidal seagrass meadows impacted by coastal constructions (with 0\% seagrass cover at present) and three adjacent non-impacted old-established meadows (with 100\% seagrass cover at present) were studied along with an area of bare sediment and two recent-established seagrass meadows. We observed that the non-impacted areas presented 3-fold higher per-centage of mud and 1.5 times higher sedimentary organic carbon stock than impacted areas. Although the impacted area was relatively small (0.05-0.07 ha), coastal infrastructures caused a significant reduction of the sedimentary carbon stock, between 1.1 and 2.2 Mg OC, and a total loss of the carbon sequestration capacity of the impacted meadow. We also found that the organic carbon stock and total nitrogen stock of the recent -established meadow were 30\% lower than those of the old-established ones, indicating that OC and TN accu-mulation within the meadows is a continuous process, which has important consequences for conservation and restoration actions. These results contribute to understanding the spatial variability of blue carbon and nitrogen stocks in coastal systems highly impacted by urban development.

TI  - Alkalinity Production Coupled to Pyrite Formation Represents an Unaccounted Blue Carbon Sink
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems, including mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses, mitigate climate change by storing atmospheric carbon. Previous blue carbon research has focused on organic carbon stocks. However, recent studies suggest that lateral inorganic carbon export might be equally important. Lateral export is a long-term carbon sink if carbon is exported as alkalinity (TAlk) produced via sulfate reduction coupled to pyrite formation. This study evaluates drivers of pyrite formation in blue carbon ecosystems, compares pyrite production to TAlk outwelling rates, and estimates global pyrite stocks in mangroves. We quantified pyrite stocks in mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses along a latitudinal gradient on the Australian East Coast, including a mangrove dieback area, and in the Everglades (Florida, USA). Our results indicate that pyrite stocks were driven by a combination of biomass, tidal amplitude, sediment organic carbon, sediment accumulation rates, rainfall, latitude, temperature, and iron availability. Pyrite stocks were three-times higher in mangroves (103Â Â±Â 61Â Mg/ha) than in saltmarshes (30Â Â±Â 30Â Mg/ha) and seagrasses (32Â Â±Â 1Â Mg/ha). Mangrove pyrite stocks were linearly correlated to TAlk export at sites where sulfate reduction was the dominant TAlk producing process. However, pyrite generation could not explain all TAlk outwelling. We present the first global model estimating pyrite stocks in mangroves, giving a first-order estimate of 197Â Mg/ha (RMSEÂ =Â 24Â Mg/ha). In mangroves, estimated global TAlk production coupled to pyrite formation (âˆ¼3Â mol/m2/y) is equal to âˆ¼24% of their global carbon burial rate, highlighting the importance of including TAlk export in future blue carbon budgets.

TI  - Effects of naturally acidified seawater on seagrass calcareous epibionts
AB  - Surface ocean pH is likely to decrease by up to 0.4 units by 2100 due to the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere. Short-term experiments have revealed that this degree of seawater acidification can alter calcification rates in certain planktonic and benthic organisms, although the effects recorded may be shock responses and the long-term ecological effects are unknown. Here, we show the response of calcareous seagrass epibionts to elevated CO2 partial pressure in aquaria and at a volcanic vent area where seagrass habitat has been exposed to high CO2 levels for decades. Coralline algae were the dominant contributors to calcium carbonate mass on seagrass blades at normal pH but were absent from the system at mean pH 7.7 and were dissolved in aquaria enriched with CO2. In the field, bryozoans were the only calcifiers present on seagrass blades at mean pH 7.7 where the total mass of epiphytic calcium carbonate was 90 per cent lower than that at pH 8.2. These findings suggest that ocean acidification may have dramatic effects on the diversity of seagrass habitats and lead to a shift in the biogeochemical cycling of both carbon and carbonate in coastal ecosystems dominated by seagrass beds.

TI  - Drivers and modelling of blue carbon stock variability in sediments of southeastern Australia
AB  - Tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows are important global carbon (C) sinks, commonly referred to as coastal ``blue carbon{''}. However, these ecosystems are rapidly declining with little understanding of what drives the magnitude and variability of C associated with them, making strategic and effective management of blue C stocks challenging. In this study, our aims were threefold: (1) identify ecological, geomorphological, and anthropogenic variables associated with 30 cm deep sediment C stock variability in blue C ecosystems in southeastern Australia, (2) create a predictive model of 30 cm deep sediment blue C stocks in southeastern Australia, and (3) map regional 30 cm deep sediment blue C stock magnitude and variability. We had the unique opportunity to use a high-spatial-density C stock dataset of sediments to 30 cm deep from 96 blue C ecosystems across the state of Victoria, Australia, integrated with spatially explicit environmental data to reach these aims. We used an information theoretic approach to create, average, validate, and select the best averaged general linear mixed effects model for predicting C stocks across the state. Ecological drivers (i.e. ecosystem type or ecological vegetation class) best explained variability in C stocks, relative to geomorphological and anthropogenic drivers. Of the geomorphological variables, distance to coast, distance to freshwater, and slope best explained C stock variability. Anthropogenic variables were of least importance. Our model explained 46\% of the variability in 30 cm deep sediment C stocks, and we estimated over 2.31 million Mg C stored in the top 30 cm of sediments in coastal blue C ecosystems in Victoria, 88\% of which was contained within four major coastal areas due to the extent of blue C ecosystems (similar to 87\% of total blue C ecosystem area). Regionally, these data can inform conservation management, paired with assessment of other ecosystem services, by enabling identification of hotspots for protection and key locations for restoration efforts. We recommend these methods be tested for applicability to other regions of the globe for identifying drivers of sediment C stock variability and producing predictive C stock models at scales relevant for resource management.

TI  - Blue carbon stock in sediments of mangroves and seagrass ecosystems at Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia
AB  - Coastal ecosystems store approximately 80% of carbon in sediments, which could be emitted due to degradation and deforestation. Therefore, protecting and managing these ecosystems are crucial for climate change mitigation. This study aims to determine sediment bulk density (SBD), sediment organic carbon (SOC) concentration, and sediment carbon stocks (SCS) in mangroves and seagrasses, and to elucidate how the protection scheme impacts them. We collected four sediment cores of 100 cm each from protected and unprotected mangrove areas and three sediment cores of 80 cm each from unprotected and protected seagrass areas. The average SBD in mangroves was 0.48 g cmâˆ’3 in protected areas and 0.55 g cmâˆ’3 in unprotected areas, while the average SBD in seagrass was 0.79 g cmâˆ’3 in protected areas and 0.85 g cmâˆ’3 in unprotected areas. The average SOC in mangroves was 8.65% in protected areas and 8.63% in unprotected areas, while the average SOC in seagrass was 5.89% and 6.25% in protected and unprotected areas, respectively. The average SCS in the protected area was 381 and 363 Mg C haâˆ’1 in the mangrove and seagrass ecosystems, respectively. On the other hand, the average SCS in the unprotected areas was 449 and 422 Mg C haâˆ’1 in mangroves and seagrass ecosystems, respectively. Although we did not find any significant differences in SCS between protected and unprotected ecosystems regardless of ecosystem types, the conservation management of blue carbon ecosystems is still needed to avoid future carbon emissions.

TI  - Highly productive tropical seagrass beds support diverse consumers and a large organic carbon pool in the sediments
AB  - Tropical seagrass beds are productive coastal ecosystems that are important blue carbon sinks and crucial habitats and feeding grounds for consumers at high trophic levels. To understand how energy sustains the ecosystem from seagrass production, we constructed an Ecopath trophic model to reveal the possible pathways of energy flow in the tropical seagrass beds around Dongsha Island, South China Sea. The model indicates that Dongsha seagrass beds were developing but well-structured ecosystems. The productive seagrasses were rarely directly consumed by herbivores and, ultimately, flowed into detrital pools. Detritus was the main food source used to support diverse consumers in the food web. Nevertheless, the low cycling rate (2.74%) suggests that most detritus was not reused or exported and was stored as a large organic carbon pool in the sediments. The detritus-feeding invertebrates are keystone groups in the Dongsha seagrass beds, as they recycle energy from detritus and transfer to top predators such as sharks. The predation of top predators affected the biomasses of other compartments, leading to strong top-down control via a trophic cascade effect. Â© 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Significant Organic Carbon Accumulation in Two Coastal Acid Sulfate Soil Wetlands
AB  - Restoring degraded freshwater wetlands may help to maximize soil carbon sequestration. In this study, we use 18 Pb-210-dated sediment cores to determine the organic carbon (OC) accumulation rates from two hydrologically restored freshwater coastal acid sulfate soil (CASS) wetlands. Recent OC accumulation rates (from similar to 1980 to present) were estimated to be 251 +/- 26 g.m(-2).year(-1) in the seasonally inundated CASS and 227 +/- 50 g.m(-2).year(-1) in the permanently inundated CASS. The average OC accumulation during the previous century (190 +/- 20 g.m(-2).year(-1)) was within the range of blue carbon ecosystems (saltmarshes, mangroves, and seagrasses). Considering their large area and carbon accumulation rate, we estimate that Australian CASS wetlands sequester approximately 7.8 +/- 0.8 Tg of carbon annually, which is equivalent to similar to 8\% of the CO2 emission from fossil fuels in Australia. Hence, preserving or restoring CASS may be a good climate change mitigation strategy. Plain Language Summary Coastal freshwater wetlands are highly productive and can sequester large amounts of carbon. The carbon accumulation rates here suggest that coastal acid sulfate soils (CASS) are also a substantial sink of CO2. By extrapolating our observations, we show that approximately 7.79 Tg of carbon is sequestered in Australian CASS wetlands annually which is equivalent to similar to 8\% of the CO2 emission from fossil fuels in Australia. Hence, managing CASS wetlands to protect their soil carbon store function may help offset anthropogenic sources of greenhouse gasses and their hydrological remediation could be an important component to the global carbon cycle.

TI  - Estimation of Seagrass Biomass by In Situ Measurement and Remote Sensing Technology on Small Islands, Indonesia
AB  - As one of the major blue carbon ecosystems, studying, conserving, and monitoring seagrass meadows, especially on small populated islands, has become very important due to their vulnerability to anthropogenic and global environmental factors. In this study, we used satellite image analysis and biological data to map seagrass percent cover (SPC), above-ground biomass (AGB), and below-ground biomass (BGB) on the three most populated islands of the Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia, i.e., Kodingareng Lompo, Barrang Lompo, and Barrang Caddi. Reflectance and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values of Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery were used to classify and calculate SPC and AGB. In situ biological data measurements were carried out from 3 to 14 of June, 2020, on the three islands to measure AGB and BGB. The result from image classification shows a total area of 126.37 Ha of seagrass, which was divided into three SPC categories: medium (30-59.9\%) with a total area of 78.38 Ha; low (0-29.9\%) with a total area of 13.1 Ha; and high (60-100\%) with a total area of 34.89 Ha. The highest SPC area was observed on Kodingareng Lompo Island with 61.07Ha, followed by Barrang Lompo Island with 53.18Ha, and Barrangcaddi Island with 12.12Ha. The total AGB on Barrang Lompo, Kodingareng Lompo, and Barrangcaddi in tons of dry weight/ha were 1.83, 1.05, and 2.38, respectively. The highest BGB was reported on Barrangcaddi Island with 8.61 tons of dry weight/ha, followed by Barrang Lompo Island with 6.78 tons of dry weight/ha, and Kodingareng Lompo Island with 2.78 tons of dry weight/ha. Regression analysis showed a linear correlation between NDVI value and in situ SPC with R-2 = 0.8255. The framework of this study can be applied to monitor temporal changes of seagrass meadows distribution on small islands to promote a more sustainable ecosystem.

TI  - The greenhouse gas offset potential from seagrass restoration
AB  - Awarding CO2 offset credits may incentivize seagrass restoration projects and help reverse greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from global seagrass loss. However, no study has quantified net GHG removal from the atmosphere from a seagrass restoration project, which would require coupled C-org stock and GHG flux enhancement measurements, or determined whether the creditable offset benefit can finance the restoration. We measured all of the necessary GHG accounting parameters in the 7-km(2) Zostera marina (eelgrass) meadow in Virginia, U.S.A., part of the largest, most cost-effective meadow restoration to date, to provide the first seagrass offset finance test-of-concept. Restoring seagrass removed 9,600 tCO(2) from the atmosphere over 15 years but also enhanced both CH4 and N2O production, releasing 950 tCO(2)e. Despite tripling the N2O flux to 0.06gm(-2) yr(-1) and increasing CH4 8-fold to 0.8gm(-2) yr(-1), the meadow now offsets 0.42 tCO(2)e ha(-1) yr(-1), which is roughly equivalent to the seagrass sequestration rate for GHG inventory accounting but lower than the rates for temperate and tropical forests. The financial benefit for this highly successful project, \$87K at \$10 MtCO(2)e(-1), defrays similar to 10\% of the restoration cost. Managers should also consider seagrass co-benefits, which provide additional incentives for seagrass restoration.

TI  - Mechanisms of bicarbonate use influence the photosynthetic carbon dioxide sensitivity of tropical seagrasses
AB  - The photosynthetic bicarbonate (HCO3-) use properties of three widely distributed tropical seagrasses were compared using a series of laboratory experiments. Photosynthetic rates of Thalassia testudinum, Halodule wrightii, and Syringodium filiforme were monitored in an enclosed chamber while being subjected to shifts in pH and dissolved inorganic carbon. Specific mechanisms of seagrass HCO3- use were compared by examining the photosynthetic effects of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide (AZ). All seagrasses increased photosynthetic rates with reduced pH, suggesting a large effect of dissolved aqueous carbon dioxide (CO2(aq)). However, there was considerable interspecific variation in pH response. T. testudinum was highly sensitive, increasing photosynthetic rates by 100\% as the pH was reduced from 8.2 to 7.4, whereas rates in H. wrightii and S. filiforme increased by only 20\% over a similar range, and displayed prominent photosynthetic plateaus, indicating an increased capacity for HCO3- use. Additional incubations that manipulated {[}HCO3-] under constant [}CO2(aq)] support these findings, as only H. wrightii and S. filiforme increased photosynthetic rates with increasing {[}HCO3-]. T. testudinum responded to AZ addition, indicating that carbonic anhydrase enzymes facilitate limited HCO3- use. H. wrightii and S. filiforme showed no response to AZ, suggesting alternate, more efficient mechanisms of HCO3- use. Estimated kinetic parameters, K-s(CO2) and V-max, revealed interspecific variation and further support these conclusions. Variation in photosynthetic pH responses and AZ sensitivity indicate distinctions in the carbon use properties of seagrasses exposed to similar environmental conditions. These results suggest that not all seagrasses will similarly respond to future increases in CO2(aq) availability. Attention towards potential shifts in competitive interactions within multispecific seagrass beds is warranted.

TI  - Rhizome starch as indicator for temperate seagrass winter survival
AB  - Key-ecosystems such as seagrass beds are disappearing on a global scale. In order to counter-act local loss of seagrass beds, seagrass restoration projects have been carried out with varying degrees of success. As seagrass biomass peaks in summer, most restoration projects are monitored during this period, while wintering processes are largely ignored. We here attempted to elucidate some important bottlenecks for wintering survival in temperate areas of the intertidal model species Zostera noltii, using a three-year transplant-monitoring dataset and a field experiment. We found that next year's transplant success could not be predicted based on the preceding year's growth success, emphasizing the winter as a crucial period for survival of seagrass transplants. In addition, transplant success was neither determined by abiotic site characteristics. Low autumn rhizome starch concentrations in unsuccessful transplants, compared to successful transplants and natural beds, hinted at the importance of starch for winter survival. Hence, we tested the importance of starch, accumulated in autumn, versus the importance of the presence of sparse aboveground photosynthetic winter biomass for winter survival of seagrass transplants in a field experiment. We clipped the overwintering-leaves of three natural beds that naturally varied in their autumn rhizome starch concentrations. Decreased leaf densities in winter did not affect seagrass biomass in June, nor did this treatment affect rhizome starch concentration in June. Autumn rhizome starch reserves did however provide a good indication of next year's growth success, confirming the importance of starch reserves for winter survival. We thus conclude that autumn rhizome starch can be a good predictor of next year's growth success, whereas the preceding growing season shoot density and the presence of leaves during the winter were bad indicators of next year's growth success.

TI  - Reply to Macreadie et al Comment on `Geoengineering with seagrasses: is credit due where credit is given?'
AB  - Macreadie et al (this issue; M2017 Environ. Res. Lett.) challenged the conclusion presented by Johannessen and Macdonald (2016 Environ. Res. Lett.) that global estimates of carbon sequestration by seagrass meadows were too high. Here we clarify our global calculation, respond to M2017's criticisms and explain how the persistent misunderstandings about sediment dynamics within the Blue Carbon community continue to lead to overestimates of carbon sequestration in seagrass meadows. We point out that, although seagrasses appear to have a local effect on carbon sequestration compared with nearby barren sediments, their preferred substrate (slowly-accumulating, coarse sediment) makes them among the least effective coastal environments for burying carbon. We conclude with a proposal for the development of robust international protocols to quantify carbon burial in seagrass meadows that account for sediment accumulation, sediment mixing and carbon remineralization.

TI  - The effect of storage condition on viability of Enhalus acoroides seedlings
AB  - Using nursery stock grown from seeds rather than transplants could improve success of seagrass restoration. In Indonesia, Enhalus acoroides is the climax seagrass species and the target species for restoration. However, optimal conditions for seed storage are not known. The aim of this study was to determine optimal storage conditions for E. acoroides seeds to maximize germination and growth. Seed germination was examined under different lengths of storage and storage temperatures (room and refrigerator) for Enhalus fruits (with the seed inside). Enhalus seeds did not survive well and turned black after 2 days in the refrigerator (4 degrees C). Seeds held in room temperature (similar to 30 degrees C) for 2-11 days survived and grew to seedlings. Survival of the seedlings in the field was also correlated with the performance of the seedling when raised for 10 weeks in the laboratory. Seedlings stored in refrigerator had reduced survival (87.5\%) in the field compared to seedlings stored 2-5 days in room temperature (100\% survival). However, seeds stored up to 8 days, even at room temperature, produced seedlings that did not survive well either in the laboratory or in the field (survival was less than 20\%). Our results indicate that long-term seed storage in the laboratory will not be feasible for restoration. Because using seeds for restoration is important for maintaining genetic diversity, the establishment of a seedling nursery in the field provides a viable alternative for Enhalus restoration, although it will be logistically more challenging than a seed storage bank.

TI  - Carbon Content in Different Seagrass Species in Andaman Coast of Thailand
AB  - Seagrass meadows have one of the highest carbon sequestration and storage capacities than any other ecosystems. Carbon that is stored in the ecosystem is accumulated in the deposited sediment as well as in the living, above and below ground biomass, with a different rate of carbon sequestration and storage between the species. The objective of this research was to investigate carbon storage in the living plants and in the sediment among species of different size in tropical waters. The samples were collected from Phuket province, Thailand, in the high density monospecific patches of different size species (Enhalus acoroides as a big, Thalassia hemprhicii as a medium and Halophila ovalis as a small size species). Total carbon and carbon stored in above and below ground, was significantly different between the species (p<0.05), with the highest values in below ground parts of E. acoroides and T. hemprichii 238.10 +/- 85.07 and 134 +/- 21.55 g Dw m(-2), respectively. Average organic carbon in the sediment was significantly different (p<0.05) as well, with E. acoroides having highest organic carbon content in the deeper layers of the sediment 1.14 +/- 0.25 \% C-org, while the other two species had higher organic carbon in the top and medium layers of sediment. The results of this preliminary research propose that big size species have higher carbon content than smaller species, which reflects in higher sequestration rates of carbon from the ocean, thus reducing the ocean carbon budget. Moreover, it provides necessary information on size of the species which is the key for the future carbon storage studies in the region.

TI  - Carbon storage and mineralization in coastal wetlands
AB  - This synthesis and conclusion chapter aims to compare the processes and drivers of carbon mineralization in different coastal wetlands and provide recommendations on â€œblue carbon managementâ€ in relation to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and/or litter decomposition of different coast wetlands. Ecosystem carbon stocks in coastal wetlands almost double those of boreal, temperate, and tropical terrestrial ecosystems. Coastal wetlands are net carbon sinks as indicated by net ecosystem exchange (NEE) (output-input) ranging from âˆ’589.3 to âˆ’122.3g C mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1. We reiterate that coastal wetlands play a disproportionately important role in ameliorating climate change. Carbon use (i.e., ecosystem respiration/gross primary production) is higher in tree-dominated mangroves (0.7) than herb-dominated seagrasses (0.85) and tidal marshes (0.93). Carbon mineralization will partly counteract the potential of coastal wetlands for mitigating climate change. We synthesize knowledge on how carbon mineralization in coastal wetlands may be affected by climate change and anthropogenic activities. This knowledge will enhance understanding on the vulnerability of carbon stocks to negative global environmental changes and facilitate carbon management by reducing carbon emissions. We highlight the lessons learnt from past and current management of coastal wetland carbon budgets, to inform future research and management initiatives and practices. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc.
