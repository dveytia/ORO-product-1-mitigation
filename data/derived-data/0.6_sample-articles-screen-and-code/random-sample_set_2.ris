TI  - Preliminary investigations into the hydrodynamic performance of lift-based wave energy converters
AB  - The majority of devices designed to extract energy from ocean waves operate through exploitation of the buoyancy (Froude-Krylov) and/or diffraction force regimes. Such devices extract energy through interaction with the displacement and/or acceleration of fluid particle motions respectively. By comparison, very little consideration has been given to systems which extract wave energy through coupling with fluid particle velocities. This paper performs a preliminary investigation into the hydrodynamics of a Wave Energy Converter (WEC) that is driven through interaction with the wave-induced fluid particle velocity. In particular, the work focuses on liftbased WECs consisting of a number of wave-driven, rotating hydrofoils. The paper develops a mathematical framework for such a system operating in regular, linear waves in 2D. It is noted that despite the unique nature of the device, it is possible to represent its operation using mathematics which are already familiar to the wave energy sector. The mathematical framework is subsequently used to investigate the performance of a pair of wave-driven, rotating hydrofoils. Results show that power capture efficiencies up to approximately 80% are potentially possible for the particular system considered under the constraints assumed. It is also found that the system is relatively insensitive to variations in design and control conditions. This suggests that further investigation is warranted to determine if lift-based WECs might represent a reasonable means of wave energy extraction. Â© European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference 2021.

TI  - Supercritical CO2 Brayton power cycles for DEMO (demonstration power plant) fusion reactor based on dual coolant lithium lead blanket
AB  - This paper presents an exploratory analysis of the suitability of supercritical CO2 Brayton power cycles as alternative energy conversion systems for a future fusion reactor based on a DCLL (dual coolant lithium-lead) blanket, as prescribed by EUROfusion. The main issue dealt is the optimization of the integration of the different thermal sources with the power cycle in order to achieve the highest electricity production. The analysis includes the assessment of the pumping consumption in the heating and cooling loops, taking into account additional considerations as control issues and integration of thermal energy storage systems. An exergy analysis has been performed in order to understand the behavior of each layout.Up to ten scenarios have been analyzed assessing different locations for thermal sources heat exchangers. Neglecting the worst four scenarios, it is observed less than 2% of variation among the other six ones. One of the best six scenarios clearly stands out over the others due to the location of the thermal sources in a unique island, being this scenario compatible with the control criteria. In this proposal 34.6% of electric efficiency (before the self-consumptions of the reactor but including pumping consumptions and generator efficiency) is achieved. Â© 2016 EURATOM.

TI  - Numerical Analysis of Horizontal Bearing Capacity of Composite Pile Foundation for Offshore Wind Turbine
AB  - In recent years, with the rapid development of offshore wind power, the installed capacity is increasing, and the traditional single pile foundation is under heavy load. Therefore, the composite pile foundation composed of single pile foundation and bucket foundation (friction wheel) installed outside the pile body is gradually adopted to ensure the safety and stability of the fan during its service. In order to study the bearing capacity of composite pile foundation, the ABAQUS finite element software is used to study the horizontal bearing capacity of composite pile foundation, analyze its bearing capacity advantages compared with the traditional single pile foundation, and further optimize the design. The results show that: under the same load, the displacement and bending moment of composite pile foundation are greatly reduced due to the existence of friction wheel, and the horizontal bearing capacity of composite pile foundation is significantly better than that of single pile foundation; the diameter and height of friction wheel in composite pile foundation have obvious influence on its horizontal bearing capacity, but its thickness has limited influence on the horizontal bearing capacity of composite pile foundation. It can be seen that the bearing capacity of composite pile foundation is significantly better than that of single pile. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Application of an offshore wind farm layout optimization methodology at Middelgrunden wind farm
AB  - This article explores the application of a wind farm layout evaluation function and layout optimization framework to Middelgrunden wind farm in Denmark. This framework has been built considering the interests of wind farm developers in order to aid in the planning of future offshore wind farms using the UK Round 3 wind farms as a point of reference to calibrate the model. The present work applies the developed evaluation tool to estimate the cost, energy production, and the levelized cost of energy for the existing as-built layout at Middelgrunden wind farm; comparing these against the cost and energy production reported by the wind farm operator. From here, new layouts have then been designed using either a genetic algorithm or a particle swarm optimizer. This study has found that both optimization algorithms are capable of identifying layouts with reduced levelized cost of energy compared to the existing layout while still considering the specific conditions and constraints at this site and those typical of future projects. Reductions in levelized cost of energy such as this can result in significant savings over the lifetime of the project thereby highlighting the need for including new advanced methods to wind farm layout design.

TI  - Distribution of black carbon in sediments from mangrove wetlands in China
AB  - Black carbon (BC) is a carbonaceous residue generated by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass. It forms an important component of the mangrove carbon pool. Although coastal and marine sediments have long been recognized as important sinks for BC, there are few reports on its distribution in mangrove sediments. This study investigated BC distribution and the associated environmental implications in sediments of various size fractions. Mangrove sediments were collected from 44 sites in the Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, and Fujian Provinces of China. Sediments from the Hainan Province were found to have much higher organic carbon (OC) and BC content than those from other provinces. Sediment OC and the BC content showed a significant positive relationship. Sediments from the Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan provinces showed significant BC accumulation with an enrichment factor > 1, especially in the size fractions 0.053-0.25 mm and 0.25-2 mm. Sediments from different sampling sites did not show significantly different BC distribution between the various size fractions. A higher mass loading of BC was observed among fine particles in samples from the Fujian Province, and among the larger particles in samples from the Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan provinces. Among all the samples, the BC/OC ratio ranged from 0.21 to 0.29, indicating that BC originates from a combination of biomass and mineral combustion. The average delta C-13 values in the sediments varied between the sampling plots. The highest delta C-13 values were recorded in the Fujian province, which indicates the proportion of BC from biomass combustion in mangroves in Fujian Province is higher than that in other Provinces.

TI  - STUDY ON ROUGH-SEA PERFORMANCE OF LOWER-POWERED LARGE FULL SHIPS.
AB  - Model experiments and full-scale measurements were carried out to investigate operational performance of lower-powered large and full ships in rough seas. Further, prediction of speed loss and course keeping ability was made to get better understanding of the performance of the lower- and higher-powered ships in a seaway. The results indicate that in higher sea and wind the lower-powered ship will suffer from larger speed loss and show poorer course keeping capability than the higher-powered one. Therefore, the need is emphasized for careful consideration on propulsive performance and course keeping ability under the current trend for energy saving design. A tentative powering guidance is shown for the design of lower-powered energy-saving ships from the viewpoint of ship's operational performance in rough seas.

TI  - Plant- and microbe-assisted biochar amendment technology for petroleum hydrocarbon remediation in saline-sodic soils: A review
AB  - Soil degradation through salinization and pollution by toxic compounds such as petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs) in the coastal wetlands has become a significant threat to ecosystem health, biodiversity, and food security. However, traditional remediation technologies can generate secondary pollutants, incur high operating costs, and consume significant quantities of energy. Bioremediation, using plants, biochar, and microbes, is an innovative and cost-effective option to remediate contaminated soils. Biochar, as a plant/microbe growth enhancer, is a promising green approach for the sustainable phytoremediation of PHCs in salinized soils. This review therefore summarizes the effect of plant-and microbe-assisted biochar amendment technology for the remediation of PHCs and salinization. Plant-microbe interactions mediated rhizodegradation despite increasing hydrocarbon sorption. Overall, microbial respiration is more active in biochar amendments, due to faster biodegradation of PHCs and improved soil properties. The use of biochar, plants, and microbes is recommended, as it offers a practical and sustainable option, both ecologically and economically, for the remediation of PHCs and excess salinity. Further development of new green technologies is to be encouraged.

TI  - Continuous spatial modelling to analyse planning and economic consequences of offshore wind energy
AB  - Offshore wind resources appear abundant, but technological, economic and planning issues significantly reduce the theoretical potential. While massive investments are anticipated and planners and developers are scouting for viable locations and consider risk and impact, few studies simultaneously address potentials and costs together with the consequences of proposed planning in an analytical and continuous manner and for larger areas at once. Consequences may be investments short of efficiency and equity, and failed planning routines. A spatial resource economic model for the Danish offshore waters is presented, used to analyse area constraints, technological risks, priorities for development and opportunity costs of maintaining competing area uses. The SCREAM-offshore wind model (Spatially Continuous Resource Economic Analysis Model) uses raster-based geographical information systems (GIS) and considers numerous geographical factors, technology and cost data as well as planning information. Novel elements are weighted visibility analysis and geographically recorded shipping movements as variable constraints. A number of scenarios have been described, which include restrictions of using offshore areas, as well as alternative uses such as conservation and tourism. The results comprise maps, tables and cost-supply curves for further resource economic assessment and policy analysis. A discussion of parameter variations exposes uncertainties of technology development, environmental protection as well as competing area uses and illustrates how such models might assist in ameliorating public planning, while procuring decision bases for the political process. The method can be adapted to different research questions, and is largely applicable in other parts of the world. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Analysis of an offshore medium voltage DC Microgrid environment - Part I: Power sharing controller design
AB  - The AC microgrid is proposed as a plug-and-play interface for various types of renewable generation resources. The fundamental microgrid requirements include the capability of operating in islanding mode and/or grid connected modes. The high-level technical challenges associated with microgrids include (1) operation modes and transitions that comply with IEEE1547 and (2) control architecture and communication. Proposed control layers and respective functions have been defined in the microgrid literature. These layers include the primary, secondary and tertiary control. In this work, the focus is on the design of a power management secondary control for an offshore DC microgrid serving induction motor drives. The power is managed through a secondary controller to adjust the power delivered through bidirectional DC/DC converters, which intertie with the inverters connected to the machine loads. Simulations in Matlab/Simulink demonstrate the system performance under a mechanical torque step change for one motor drive unit with other conditions fixed. Part I of the concept emphasizes the electrical layout and part II, a communication layout of the offshore platform is described. Â© 2014 IEEE.

TI  - Modelling seabed ploughing using the material point method
AB  - Ploughing of the seabed is needed for the installation of cables and pipelines and is an area of construction likely to increase given plans in the UK and elsewhere for offshore marine energy (wind and tidal). Seabed ploughing is an expensive and sometimes risky operation for which there are limited guidelines as to what the tow force and speed is for an expected trenching profile within a specified ground condition. Most ploughing schemes are designed using semi-empirical approaches, with very few computational tools able to take into account the geometric and material nonlinearity inherited by the ploughing problem. In this paper we describe how the Material Point Method (MPM) is being used as a numerical tool to model seabed ploughing with the aim of providing an improved predictive tool for the future, via an EPSRC-funded research project at Durham and Dundee Universities. Various issues are discussed in the paper including the means of modelling moving essential boundaries and the choice of basis functions, and this new method in MPM is demonstrated on a simple ploughing problem.

TI  - Ocean iron fertilization and international law
AB  - Intentional ocean fertilization and the commercial sale of associated carbon offsets raise a number of issues in international law. On the one hand, states are obliged to adopt adaptation and mitigation measures to prevent dangerous climate change. On the other hand, international law obliges states to protect and preserve the marine environment and to act in a precautionary manner in the face of scientific uncertainty. In this article, we examine the application of the international Law of the Sea to ocean fertilization, with particular reference to the law's dumping regime, which prohibits the dumping of wastes or other materials from vessels into the ocean. We then examine the application of the international legal regime on climate change to ocean fertilization and assess the international legal basis for the sale of carbon offsets or carbon credits associated with ocean fertilization. We conclude that ocean fertilization is governed by the dumping regime and that its commercialization is inconsistent with international law unless and until independent, internationally peer-reviewed scientific research and assessment demonstrates that it is effective and that its benefits outweigh the risks to the marine environment.

TI  - A techno-economic assessment of offshore wind energy in Chile
AB  - Offshore wind energy potential and its technical and economic feasibility were determined in Chile. Wind speed data from ERA-Interim reanalysis 10 m above the sea surface between 1979 and 2014 was used. The capacity factor and performance of the V164-8.0 MW wind generator was also determined. Using this information along with data from other studies, the following economic indicators were calculated: Levelized Cost Of Energy (LCOE), Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Pay-Back (PB). The results show that the area between 45 and 56 degrees S has the highest values in terms of both power density (similar to 3190 W/m(2)) and capacity factor (similar to 70\%), as well as the lowest LCOE values (72-100 USD \$/MWh). The area between 30 and 32 degrees S was estimated to be the most suitable area for implementing an offshore wind project because of its wind power density (between 700 W/m2 and 900 W/m2), capacity factors between 40\% and 60\%, LCOE between 100 and 114 USD\$/MWh. This work shows how important studying Chile's offshore wind power is for to be used and for removing barriers to current knowledge about this renewable energy and the benefits it would bring to Chile's power array.

TI  - Further observations of a decreasing atmospheric CO2 uptake capacity in the Canada Basin (Arctic Ocean) due to sea ice loss
AB  - Using data collected in 2009, we evaluated the potential for the southeastern Canada Basin (Arctic Ocean) to act as an atmospheric CO2 sink under the summertime ice-free conditions expected in the near future. Beneath a heavily decayed ice cover, we found surprisingly high pCO 2sw (~290-320 Î¼atm), considering that surface water temperatures were low and the influence of ice melt was strong. A simple model simulating melt of the remaining ice and exposure of the surface water for 100 days revealed a weak capacity for atmospheric CO2 uptake (mean flux: -2.4 mmol m-2 d-1), due largely to warming of the shallow mixed layer. Our results confirm a previous finding that the Canada Basin is not a significant sink of atmospheric CO2 under summertime ice-free conditions and that increased ventilation of the surface mixed layer due to sea ice loss is weakening the sink even further. Key Points The southeastern Canada Basin has a weak capacity to absorb atmospheric CO2 A shallow mixed layer that warms rapidly after ice loss inhibits CO2 uptake Ice-free summers in the Canada Basin will not create a significant new CO2 sink.

TI  - The potential of cross-stream aligned sub-arrays to increase tidal turbine efficiency
AB  - A theoretical model is proposed for a row of sub-arrays of tidal turbines aligned in a cross-stream fashion across part of a wide channel. This model builds on previous work investigating the behaviour of a single partial row array that split the problem into two flow scales; device and channel. In the present work, three flow scales are proposed: device, sub-array and channel flow, allowing the mass, energy and momentum conservation balance to be assessed separately at each scale. The power potential of a row of sub-arrays with varying blockage ratios at each flow scale is investigated, and it is found that increasing device local blockage has the greatest potential to increase power yield. It is also found that, for such a single row tidal farm with a sufficient number of devices in a very wide channel, splitting the long fence array into multiple smaller co-linear sub-fences can increase the overall energy extraction potential. A new maximum power coefficient is found in infinitely wide flow, increasing from the Lanchester-Betz limit of 0.593 for turbines in unblocked flow, past the partial row array limit of 0.798, to a new limiting value of 0.865 for a row of multiple sub-arrays.

TI  - A modified production possibility frontier for efficient forestry management under the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
AB  - Carbon sequestered through increased forest biomass provides a low cost means to curb emissions and has become a major focus of New Zealand's Emissions Trading Scheme. We present a forest planning optimisation model where land use is governed by forest owners maximising the returns to both timber harvest and carbon sequestration. By varying carbon prices, we model efficient trade-offs between the two forest activities along a modified production possibility frontier for four distinct wood supply regions in New Zealand. Results show that while more productive regions such as the Central North Island (CNI) and Northland have a greater capacity as a carbon sink, it is the less productive regions that have a comparative advantage in carbon sequestration in terms of a lower cost of wood production revenue foregone. However, moderate increases in carbon uptake can be achieved in the CNI at low opportunity cost by subtle changes in forestry management. The implication for policy-makers is that initial increases in carbon sequestration will be achieved at the lowest cost to society by favouring high volume timber production in some productive woodland areas and/or by more carbon farming in less productive areas.

TI  - Tidal turbines
AB  - Tidal energy is still a developing renewable energy source with only a few commercial projects having been commissioned to date. Although there are several different device designs that have been proposed and investigated for harvesting tidal energy, most of them have only been tested either at model or small scale. A handful of designs have managed to gather sufficient financial support to be tested at sea at full scale. There are currently plans for significant utility-sized tidal energy plants in the short-to-medium term. Nonetheless, these still face uncertainty regarding their eventual implementation due to financing issues that have not been entirely resolved yet. Types of damage that can affect the drive-train of a tidal turbine include misalignment, imbalance, looseness, broken gear teeth, bearing defects, lubrication variability resulting in dry contact of the rotating surfaces, and excessive wear. It is very important to be able to detect accidental impacts on the rotor and damage evolution in the drive-train. Certain commercial tidal turbines make use of vibration condition monitoring systems in the same way as most multi-MW wind turbines. This chapter presents the main tidal power generator components: rotor blades, drive train, power convertors, low-voltage consumable power, control and management systems, support structure, and power transmission. The main condition monitoring system for each component are discussed. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Selection of trading tankers for FPSO conversion projects
AB  - Review of single and double hull tanker designs has been conducted to identify the relevant aspects of the hull structure in the context of conversion into future FPSO systems. Typical designs have been selected and structural analyzes procedures for verification of the hull girder strength and the primary and secondary structures have been reviewed regarding yielding, buckling and fatigue strength. The typical defects and the main degradation modes based on the return of experience with tankers are also identified and a set of hull design parameters are described in order to evaluate the hulls candidates to conversion. The paper provides guidelines to assist the selection of trading tankers for conversion into FPSO. Based on a set of hull design parameters, different hull configurations are evaluated and the respective advantages and disadvantages assessed in order to identify the best candidates for conversion. Reserve of strength and corrosion margins have to be analyzed for each hull and compared with the FPSO project requirements, including field design life, environmental conditions and corrosion rates. Lists of typical defects and hazards based on the return of experience with tankers are also discussed. The paper also discuss the different designs based on the several parameters analyzed in order to provide guidelines to assess the hull structure condition, estimate the repair work at conversion and the inspection effort along the FPSO life. FPSO conversion projects based on existing trading tankers are still alternatives to new constructions for developments in areas like West Africa, Brazil and South East Asia. Nevertheless there are few tankers built before 1985 still available for conversion. Consequently single hull tankers built after mid 80s and double hulls built after early 90s became natural candidates to conversion into FPSO. Nevertheless, the decision making process regarding the selection of such hulls faces the higher cost of refurbishment of single hulls during the conversion and the high cost of purchase of more recent double hulls.

TI  - Role of terrestrial ecosystems in determining CO2 stabilization and recovery behaviour
AB  - Terrestrial ecosystems are sensitive to climate and can also influence it through both biophysical and biogeochemical feedbacks. Natural carbon uptake by ecosystems will control future evolution of CO2 and climate, but the ecosystems themselves may be committed to long-term changes. Here we use a coupled climate-carbon cycle GCM with dynamic vegetation to investigate the policy-relevance of these feedbacks in several idealized scenarios. Our results show that the natural carbon cycle in the ocean and on land controls the recovery of atmospheric CO2 following emissions reductions at three action points during the 21st century. Initial rates of recovery are similar but for different reasons. Ocean carbon uptake exceeds terrestrial uptake, with higher CO2 levels leading to increased ocean uptake whereas on land greater climate change at higher CO2 leads to decreased carbon storage. There are long-term committed changes to terrestrial ecosystems which vary in sign regionally and create a complex dynamic response of terrestrial carbon storage as it slowly approaches a new steady state. Neither stabilization nor CO2 recovery allows ecosystems to recover back to their initial state and the ecosystems continue to respond for decades or even centuries following emissions reductions. These long-term committed changes, in addition to realized, transient changes, must be considered when defining dangerous climate change and identifying emission-pathways to avoid it.

TI  - Compact systems for power generation and nitrogen injection
AB  - A 50 year old power system has merit offshore. Featuring a semi-combined 44% thermal efficiency, the power density exceeds gas turbines by a factor of two. A 625 MW version has been proposed installed at Halten, Norway. The 4600 ton plant, using associated gas as fuel, transfers the power ashore as 400 kV DC. Combustion at 14.3 barg, 207 psig, reduces size and heat transfer surfaces. The concept competes with pipelining and power stations ashore. Electrical component developments and the elimination of the bulk of the oil process compressors give offshore an edge. A slightly smaller version of this power plant is the basis for a 600 million SCFD nitrogen injection plant, proposed for the North Sea. The plant simply compresses its own flue gas. Residual O2 is removed to 1 ppm through catalytic combustion with fuel gas at 500Â°C. Water is removed to 25Â°C dew point by condensation. CO2 is removed by absorption to 2%, all as the flue gas is being compressed to 500 barg. Additional drying may be warranted. Â© 1988 Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Flow through a very porous obstacle in a shallow channel
AB  - A theoretical model, informed by numerical simulations based on the shallow water equations, is developed to predict the flow passing through and around a uniform porous obstacle in a shallow channel, where background friction is important. This problem is relevant to a number of practical situations, including flow through aquatic vegetation, the performance of arrays of turbines in tidal channels and hydrodynamic forces on offshore structures. To demonstrate this relevance, the theoretical model is used to (i) reinterpret core flow velocities in existing laboratory-based data for an array of emergent cylinders in shallow water emulating aquatic vegetation and (ii) reassess the optimum arrangement of tidal turbines to generate power in a tidal channel. Comparison with laboratory-based data indicates a maximum obstacle resistance (or minimum porosity) for which the present theoretical model is valid. When the obstacle resistance is above this threshold the shallow water equations do not provide an adequate representation of the flow, and the theoretical model over-predicts the core flow passing through the obstacle. The second application of the model confirms that natural bed resistance increases the power extraction potential for a partial tidal fence in a shallow channel and alters the optimum arrangement of turbines within the fence. 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

TI  - Modeling a Carbon Capture, Transport, and Storage Infrastructure for Europe
AB  - In this paper, we develop a model to analyze the economics of carbon capture, transport, and storage (CCTS) in the wake of expected rising CO2 prices. We present a scalable mixed integer, multiperiod, welfare-optimizing network model for Europe, called CCTS-Mod. The model incorporates endogenous decisions on carbon capture, pipeline and storage investments, as well as capture, flow and injection quantities based on given costs, CO2 prices, storage capacities, and point source emissions. Given full information about future costs of CCTS-technology, and CO2 prices, the model determines a cost minimizing strategy on whether to purchase CO2 certificates, or to abate the CO2 through investments into a CCTS-chain on a site by site basis. We apply the model to analyze different scenarios for the deployment of CCTS in Europe, e.g., under high and low CO2 prices, respectively. We find that beyond CO2 prices of â‚¬50 per t, CCTS can contribute to the decarbonization of Europeâ€™s industry sectors, as long as one assumes sufficient storage capacities (onshore and/or offshore). We find that CCTS is only viable for the power sector if the CO2 certificate price exceeds â‚¬75 per t. Â© 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

TI  - Hybridizing waterborne transport: Modeling and simulation of low-emissions hybrid waterbuses for the city of Venice
AB  - Hybrid-electric powertrains are among the most promising technologies for abating emissions from marine vessels in sensitive areas. However, their effectiveness strongly depends on the context they operate into. This paper attempts to evaluate the potential impact on air quality of hybridizing the diesel-powered waterbuses that currently operate in the city of Venice as part of the local public transportation network. Simulation models for conventional, series hybrid and parallel hybrid marine powertrains were developed and applied to the typical operational mission of one of these waterbuses. For the hybrid powertrains, an Energy Management Strategy is also obtained using a Dynamic Programming -based optimization algorithm. The results show that both hybrid architectures have high emission-reducing potential, with the series hybrid offering the greatest benefits. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the view of the future need of the exploitation of deep-water rich wind and wave energy resources in China, one novel tension leg platform (TLP) wind turbine (WT) and heave-type wave energy converter (WEC) combined system (TWWC)is proposed. Firstly, the NREL 5 MW wind turbine model has been selected as the research object. The aerodynamic performance is investigated based on the BEM method, and the hydrodynamic loads of both TLP platform and the WEC device is simulated based on the potential theory. The coupled aerodynamic and hydrodynamic numerical model of the TLP WT and heave-type WEC combined (TWWC) system has been established, with the consideration of the multi-body dynamic coupling effect of the power-take off system (PTO) of the WEC device. Secondly, the effect of different PTO parameters of the WEC device on the performance of the wave energy output power has been clarified. Finally, the characteristics of both dynamic coupling responses and the wind-wave output power of the novel TWWC system have been mainly investigated under typical maximum operational sea cases, and the safety of the TWWC system under representative extreme sea case has been verified.

AB  - In this article, we performed numerical simulations to investigate dissolution and dilution processes of releasing CO2 in the ocean with the advanced CO2 dilution technology, in which enhancement of horizontal dilution of released CO2 can be expected by using arrayed cylinders behind the CO2 releasing pipe. Numerical analysis in which turbulent properties based on our experimental investigations were taken into account showed that no distinct increase Of Delta pCO(2) was observed 120min later after liquid CO2 release. It was also shown that less biological impact with the proposed CO2 dilution technology was expected because increase of Delta pCO(2) was suppressed.

TI  - The role of women in seaweed aquaculture in the Western Indian Ocean and South-East Asia
AB  - In most developing countries, the majority of people involved with seaweed farming are women. Their immense contribution to the industry has been widely demonstrated and evaluated in successful examples/case studies. These `seaweed women' have made significant advances in the sustainability of seaweed farming for more than four decades and their dedication, patience and resilience illustrate tenacity in the face of crises. The roles of women are complex, including hands-on farming activities as well as small-scale processing to produce value-added products based on the seaweed biomass cultivated. We detail the role of women in seaweed aquaculture in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO, including Africa and India) and South-East Asia. In Africa, there are significantly more women than men employed, and their roles are more varied, whilst in South-East Asia, men and women are involved in almost equal numbers at the various levels of the seaweed industry. Seaweed farming in SE Asia is carried out by family-owned businesses which involve all working age members of the family, be it nuclear or extended family members, as compared with the WIO region. Five case studies of individual women are provided to show how they have been and continue to be the pillars of the seaweed farming industry. Economic gains from seaweed farming in both regions have provided positive and favourable changes in the quality of life (e.g. food, shelter, clothing, health care and social acceptance) of the family members involved. The case studies point to the commitment of women as the driving force of the seaweed industry, adding value to seaweeds, especially in the WIO. With such women spearheading the seaweed industry, the benefits will continue to be shared with whole families as well as other community members, as mothers are strong anchors of the families in many communities in developing countries.

TI  - North Atlantic right whale occurrence near wind energy areas along the mid-Atlantic US coast: implications for management
AB  - The distribution and seasonal patterns of the North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis, inform management decisions that mitigate anthropogenic threats. Based on data from visual surveys, much of the population migrates between winter calving grounds in coastal waters adjacent to the southeast USA and summer feeding and nursery grounds adjacent to the northeast USA. However, little is known about right whale occurrence along the mid-Atlantic US migratory corridor. A better understanding of right whale occurrence in this region is needed prior to offshore wind energy development activities, which may increase mortality risks and chronic impacts on the population. We conducted an 11 mo passive acoustic survey along coastal North Carolina and Georgia near several wind energy areas to document the acoustic occurrence of right whales in the southern region of the mid-Atlantic US coast. Right whales were acoustically detected across all seasons, with peak seasonal presence occurring during autumn in the Georgia site and during winter in the North Carolina site. A secondary peak in presence also occurred during June and July in the Georgia site, when right whales were not expected to be in the area. Given the nearly year-round presence of right whales in the survey areas, these results may warrant an evaluation of current management protocols in order to provide adequate protection to the population in the face of offshore energy development activities.

TI  - Wind energy on the shore coast: Study case on galiciÃ¡s coast, Spain
AB  - The necessity to protect the environment is pushing harder to develop and use new energy sources less aggressive. Idea that we can read in very well know works like the in the Emission Scenario B1 or B2 of the Special Report of Emission Scenarios of the report of working group I of IPPC (2001), B1: ...introduction of clean and resource-efficient technologies, and B2:... and more diverse technology changes. In this way the wind energy can help to minimize the quantity of greenhouse gases sent to the atmosphere to help to fight against the climate change. But this source of energy is not completely clean and has some visual and environmental negative effect. Now offshore wind farm are beginning to get developed and the new impacts are under study. Here we present two pilot projects offshore sea energy wind farm in Galicia's Coast in North West of Spain. These projects can save littoral space and be environmentally sustainable.

TI  - Nuclear grout monitoring on offshore platforms
AB  - The stability of structures in deep waters offshore is of particular concern to the oil and gas industry and to registering authorities. Over the last four years, Harwell has developed nuclear instrumentation and tracer techniques to measure the density and movement of grout used in the installation of steel jackets to the sea bed. These methods have been applied to a number of steel jackets in the North and Celtic Seas where weather conditions can greatly affect the application of traditional methods of visual inspection. This paper describes the development of these activities from the laboratory to their applica tion on the largest steel structures in the North Sea and gives details of some of the results obtained. Extensive laboratory tests have been carried out on the installed equipment to determine their response to prolonged immersion, variations in temperatures between installation and operation conditions, vibrations and shock loadings experienced during hammering of the piles. Nuclear grout density gauges have been used also for the control of grout mixers resulting in considerable improvement in the quality of grouts used for platform installations. The development of radioisotope gauges and tracer techniques has reduced the dependence of installation operations on the use of divers, thus making the operation inherently safer and reducing the effects of weather conditions on operational programmes. In addition, registering authorities are now able to have direct confirmation of the presence of grout in pile sleeves, information on seawater/grout interfaces, and in-situ measurements of grout densities during and after completion of the grouting activities.

TI  - An increasing CO2 sink in the Arctic Ocean due to sea-ice loss
AB  - The Arctic Ocean and adjacent continental shelf seas such as the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas are particularly sensitive to long-term change and low-frequency modes of atmosphere-ocean-sea-ice forcing. The cold, low salinity surface waters of the Canada Basin of the Arctic Ocean are undersaturated with respect to CO2 in the atmosphere and the region has the potential to take up atmospheric CO2, although presently suppressed by sea-ice cover. Undersaturated seawater CO2 conditions of the Arctic Ocean are maintained by export of water with low dissolved inorganic carbon content and modified by intense seasonal shelf primary production. Sea-ice extent and volume in the Arctic Ocean has decreased over the last few decades, and we estimate that the Arctic Ocean sink for CO2 has tripled over the last 3 decades (24 Tg yr-1 to 66 Tg yr-1) due to sea-ice retreat with future sea-ice melting enhancing air-to-sea CO2 flux by âˆ¼28% per decade.

TI  - A decision framework of offshore wind power station site selection using a PROMETHEE method under intuitionistic fuzzy environment: A case in China
AB  - Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method has a widely application in management and energy field. Considering the broad development prospects of offshore wind power and deficiency of integrated coastal management, a decision framework combining triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (TIFNs), Analytic Network Process (ANP) and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE) is proposed and applied in site selection of offshore wind power station (OWPS). The aim of this study is to provide theoretical and methodological support for the site selection decision-making of coastal wind power projects and to improve the benefits of integrated coastal management. Taking six criteria (wind resources, construction, economic, environment, society, risk) and the related sub-criteria into consideration, an evaluation system of OWPS site selection is established. The optimal location scheme is determined by the decision framework in current paper. After a sensitivity analysis and a comparative analysis, the result shows that decision framework has strong robustness and feasibility. Thus, the evaluation criteria and methodology in this paper can provide a theoretical reference for the development of coastal management and offshore wind power.

TI  - Economic evaluation of offshore wind farm operation and maintenance considering opportunity maintenance
AB  - In this paper, we present a simulation method approach to the economic benefits of offshore wind farm operation and maintenance. The method takes into account the meteorological accessibility. The emphasis of this study lies in reducing operation and maintenance costs and improving the economic benefits of wind farms. We propose the method of calculating economic evaluation indexes including downtime, power loss, wind farms availability, and operation and maintenance cost. The benefit simulation model of offshore wind power operation and maintenance is established based on Anylogic platform. The real-time status of wind turbines, ships and personnel and the statistics of various economic evaluation indexes are simulated to evaluate the economic benefits of operation and maintenance of offshore wind power farms. Finally, the case results show that the proposed simulation method can describe the real-time status of wind turbines and operation and maintenance resources, and calculate economic evaluation indicators. The impact of offshore meteorological conditions on the economic effect is truthfully reflected, which provides technical reference for the operation and maintenance of offshore wind power farms.

TI  - New artificial intelligence technology improving fuel efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions of ships through use of operational big data
AB  - Fuel cost and CO2 emissions in operating ships are major challenges for the maritime industry. A large marine transport company spends more than 2.6 billion U.S. dollars on fuel every year. In order to reduce fuel consumption as well as CO2 emissions from ships, it is crucial to be able to accurately calculate the impact of winds and waves on ship speed and fuel efficiency. Normally, existing ship performance estimation technologies rely on experiments with model ships in tanks of water, or on physics model simulations. However, they do not take into account the complicated interactions of winds, waves, and sea currents that influence the state of ships at real sea waters, resulting in large margins of error. Against this background, Fujitsu Laboratories has developed a technology to visualize ship performance. In addition to weather and sea conditions including winds, waves, and sea currents during actual ship operation, it collects engine log data and ship operation data such as location and ship speed, and posts it to the cloud, and then analyzes these data using high-dimensional statistical analysis that we developed. Applying this technology to a university-owned test ship and some merchant ships resulted in highly accurate estimation of ship speed and fuel consumption for each of the ships, with error of 5% or less. We also evaluated this technology through simulation and verified that it can improve fuel efficiency significantly. This paper describes this technology to predict ship performance in real sea waters, which is key to reducing ship fuel consumption, with some examples of system configurations.

TI  - Organic biomarkers to describe the major carbon inputs and cycling of organic matter in the central Great Barrier Reef region
AB  - Controversy surrounds the sources and transport of land derived pollutants in the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem because there is insufficient knowledge of the mechanism of movement of organic contaminants and the cycling of organic matter in this dynamic system. Thus a sediment and sediment trap study was used to describe the composition of resuspended and surface sediments in the south central Great Barrier Reef and its lagoon. This region is characterised by strong tides (6-8 m at Mackay) and trade winds regularly about 15-20 knots. A series of organic biomarkers detailed the cyclical processes of sediment resuspension, recolonising with marine algae and bacteria, packaging into zooplankton faecal pellets and resettlement to sediments where the organics undergo further diagenesis. With each cycle the inshore sediments are diluted with CaCO3 reef sediments and moved further offshore with the strong ebb tide currents. This results in transport of land derived materials offshore and little storage of organic materials in the lagoon or reef sediments. These processes were detailed by inorganic measurements such as \%CaCO3 and Al/Ca ratios, and by the compositions of hydrocarbon, sterol, alcohol, and fatty acid lipid fractions. Persistent contaminants such as coal dust from a coastal loading facility can be detected in high concentration inshore and decreasing out to the shelf break at 180 m approximately 40 nautical miles offshore. The normal processes would likely be amplified during cyclonic and other storms. The lipids show the sources of carbon to include diatoms and other phytoplankton, creanaerchaeota, sulfate reducing and other bacteria, land plants including mangrove leaves, plus coal dust and other petroleum contaminants.

TI  - Development and application of a multiple-attribute decision-analysis methodology for site selection of floating offshore wind farms on the UK Continental Shelf
AB  - This research presents the development of a methodology for determining the most suitable floating offshore wind farm locations for the northern coast of Scotland, through the application of multi-attribute decision-analysis. A large area off the northern coast of Scotland is defined and separated into coordinate grids. The environmental, logistical and facilities factors are first analysed in order to remove sites that fall within restricted areas. Following this, data is gathered for the remaining sites in terms of a set of Logistics, Facilities & Environmental, and Met-Ocean criteria. The logistical criterion consists of such factors as, depth, distance to ports and distance to substations. The Met-ocean criterion provides a data analysis of the wind, wave, tidal and current conditions of each site between 2011 and 2016, and the Facilities & Environmental criterion analyses the proximity of the sites to such criteria as Marine Protection Areas, Special Areas of Conservation, military training areas and subsea facilities. The compiled data is then applied to a Multiple Attribute Decision Analysis (MADA) algorithm which aggregates the data for each site and produces a utility ranking in order to determine the most suitable site for floating offshore wind. Validation is conducted through benchmark testing and correlation with government survey sites. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Offshore winds and wind energy production estimates derived from ASCAT, OSCAT, numerical weather prediction models and buoys - A comparative study for the Iberian Peninsula Atlantic coast
AB  - Different offshore wind datasets were compared with buoys measurements in the Iberian Peninsula Atlantic coast, aiming to assess the best alternatives to ocean surface measured winds for offshore wind energy assessment and other applications. Results: show that although ASCAT (Advanced SCATterometer) high-resolution product showed the lowest wind speed temporal variability and wind power flux estimations errors, a WRF (Weather Research and Forecast) model high-resolution simulation can be considered as the best alternative for offshore wind energy applications. WRF's simulation showed wind power flux estimations errors very similar to ASCAT, the best representation of the wind speed mean state and Weibull probability density functions, and provide offshore wind data at typical turbines hub heights. CCMP (Cross-Calibrated Multi Platform Ocean Surface Wind Vectors) can also be seen as a valid and readily available alternative of offshore wind data. The findings presented here can be of great value for offshore wind energy applications that focus on ocean areas where measured wind data are not available, or are insufficient for the desired purposes. An informed choice of the most accurate offshore wind databases will provide more realistic wind energy production estimates that will positively impact the preliminary planning stages of offshore wind energy exploration projects.

TI  - A transformerless series reactive/harmonic compensator for line-commutated HVDC for grid integration of offshore wind power
AB  - This paper introduces, explains, and investigates the application of a transformerless series-connected reactive/harmonic compensator. The proposed compensator is applied to compensate the high reactive-power/harmonic demand of a 12-pulse line-commutated HVDC rectifier terminal. Simulation results reveal that the proposed strategy compensates the reactive power and harmonics of the HVDC converter satisfactorily. All of this is achieved using significantly smaller capacitance at the compensator dc link than the capacitance required in the state-of-the-art shunt compensators employing passive components. The compensator thus would eliminate the need of fundamental-frequency reactive power supply and minimize (or eliminate altogether) the requirement of passive shunt harmonic compensation. This would result into smaller shunt passive filters, smaller or no shunt capacitor banks, and smaller converter transformers, leading to a more compact HVDC terminal, the current size of which is considered to be the main hurdle in its application for integration of large-scale offshore wind energy. Experimental results from a small-scale setup validate the effectiveness observed in the simulations. Â© 2012 IEEE.

TI  - Reduction of particulate matter and gaseous emission from marine diesel engines using a catalyzed particulate filter
AB  - Diesel engines are used widely as the power sources of coastal ships and international vessels primarily due to their high thermal efficiency, high fuel economy and durable performance. However, the gaseous and solid substances exhausted from diesel engines during the combustion process cause air pollution, in particular around harbor regions. In order to effectively reduce particulate matter and gaseous pollution emissions, a catalyzed particulate filter was equipped in the tail pipe of a marine diesel engine. The engine's performance and emission characteristics under various engine speeds and torques were measured using a computerized engine data control and acquisition system accompanied with an engine dynamometer. The effectiveness of installing a catalyzed particulate filter on the reduction of pollutant emissions was examined. The experimental results show that the exhaust gas temperature, carbon monoxide and smoke opacity were reduced significantly upon installation of the particulate filter. In particular, larger conversion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide - and thus larger CO2 and lower CO emissions - were observed for the marine diesel engine equipped with a catalyzed particulate filter and operated at higher engine speeds. This is presumably due to enhancement of the catalytic oxidation reaction that results from an exhaust gas with stronger stirring motion passing through the filter. The absorption of partial heating energy from the exhaust gas by the-physical structure of the particulate filter resulted in a reduction in the exhaust gas temperature. The particulate matter could be burnt to a greater extent due to the effect of the catalyst coated on the surface of the particulate filter. Moreover, the fuel consumption rate was increased slightly while the excess oxygen emission was somewhat decreased with the particulate filter. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Numerical simulation of floating offshore wind turbines including aero-elasticity and active blade pitch control
AB  - A new numerical methodology is presented for simulation of dynamic behavior of floating offshore wind turbines. Wind forces are computed in the time domain through application of blade element momentum theory using the instantaneous wind velocities, blade pitch angles, and resulting rotor speed. Equations of motion are developed and solved in Euler-space, such that no small-angle assumptions are required in the solution; vessel motions are included in wind and wave force calculations. Aero-elastic effects are quantified using the industry-standard subroutine AeroDyn, with blade pitch-angles computed by the "DISCON" subroutine, both open-source and publicly available from the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL). Effectiveness is demonstrated through a series of examples, first a case for small-angle motion is compared with results from an industry standard simulation tool for the spar-based NREL OC3-Hywind with constant wind speed and no waves; next, the same environmental conditions are applied to a smaller spar-based floater for which standard simulation tools would not be applicable. Finally, a case is presented including irregular winds and waves. Copyright Â© 2014, Offshore Technology Conference.

The adverse effects of its complex fault current characteristics on power grid protection are highlighted. According to the topological structure and control strategies of OWPP, a theoretical calculation method for OWPP's fault current under symmetric and asymmetric faults is proposed. On this basis, this paper comprehensively studies the applicability of distance protection on the tie line of OWPP, analyzes the existing problems, and gives corresponding engineering solutions.

TI  - Optimizing alternative backup power supplies with wind generator to supply isolated loads
AB  - The energy output of a wind generator (WG) is variable due to the variation of wind speed at the installation site through the day hours and year months. Therefore, a back-up power supply (BUPS) is necessary for operating WG to supply isolated loads. These BUPS may be diesel generator (DG) and /or alternative sources of renewable energy system (RES) which is available at the installation site. In this work, these BUPSS are optimized and assessed for operating with WG to supply isolated loads. The alternatives of RESs used here are photovoltaic power system (PVPS) and /or battery storage (BS). So, a hybrid model is presented here incorporates the added futures of dynamic modeling and graphic user interface in the power system block set and matlap program to assess the capacity of these BUPSs for operating with WG to supply isolated loads. Also, an economical model has been introduced to optimize the considered BUPSs from economical point of view. These models are applied numerically to estimate the capacity of alternative of WG/ DG, WG/PVPS/BS and WG/ PVPS/DG generation systems to supply an isolated load of a tourist village on the Egyptian coast of Red Sea. Also, these alternatives are optimized economically to supply the studied load.

Special equipment and procedures were required to handle and place 6-foot diameter anchor piles, 200-ton clump weights, and both 5-inch and 5 3/8-inch diameter guyline segments in 1000 feet of water. Many procedural alternatives were evaluated for each discrete step of the guying system installation. Various equipment concepts were studied for each alternative. The cost of each option was determined and the compatibility with all other options was assessed. The most reliable and cost-effective alternatives were selected for the final installation plan, which will be discussed in this paper. The effectiveness of the installation planning was verified by the success of the Lena installation. The unique equipment proved to be reliable and the efficiency of the newly developed offshore construction methods was demonstrated. Â© 1984 Offshore Technology Conference. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ocean wave energy is one of the most promising clean and renewable energy, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) can be seen as a promising technology by harvesting blue energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This work utilized a novel process to fabricate porous foam-shaped PDMS vibrator combined with aluminium metal electrode film and polyimide (Kapton) film to form a contact separation single electrode vibrating friction nanogenerator. The vibratory TENG with porous PDMS spherule (P-TENG) as vibrator enhanced the output performance with facile manufacturing process. The results show that the output voltage of the vibratory friction nanogenerator with porous spherules as the vibratory friction nanogenerator is 38.89% higher than that with solid ones and the charge accumulation and release period is eight times higher. Given the features of exceptional output performance, unprecedented robustness and universal applicability resulting from porous structure, the P-TENG is promising candidate for ocean wave energy harvesting in our water-wave experiment.

TI  - INFLUENCE OF BLADE SOLIDITY ON MARINE HYDROKINETIC TURBINES
AB  - Marine hydrokinetic (MHK) devices are currently being considered for the generation of electrical power in marine tidal regions. Turbulence generated in the boundary layers of these channels interacts with a turbine to excite the blades into low-to mid-frequency vibration. Additionally, the self-generated turbulent boundary layer on the turbine blade excites its trailing edge into vibration. Both of these hydrodynamic sources generate radiated noise. Being installed in a marine ecosystem, the noise generated by these MHK devices may affect the fish and marine mammal well-being. Since this MHK technology is relatively new, much of the design practice follows that from conventional horizontal axis wind turbines. In contrast to other underwater turbomachines like conventional merchant ships that have solid blades, wind turbine blades are made of hollow fiberglass composites. This paper systematically investigates the contrast of this design detail on the blade vibration and radiated noise for a particular MHK turbine design.

TI  - Wind field effect on the power generation and aerodynamic performance of offshore floating wind turbines
AB  - This study is aimed at investigating wind field effect on the power generation and the aerodynamic performance of offshore floating wind turbines. For this purpose, three comparative wind fields are generated: a uniform wind field, a steady wind field with wind shear, and a turbulent wind field. Aero-hydro-servo coupled analysis is performed in time-domain to estimate how a referenced semisubmersible offshore floating wind turbine behaves in the three wind fields. The results reveal the importance of wind shear and inflow turbulence to the performance of the floating wind turbine. Thrust force and power generation become very unstable in the presence of inflow turbulence. Due to the control strategy of the wind turbine, the power generation is also correlated with operational state and turbulence frequency. Although wind shear has a tiny effect on the rotor performance, the local aerodynamic load applied at a single blade experiences fluctuation with the presence of wind shear. It is also shown that the ultimate structural and fatigue damage loads at blade root are augmented by inflow turbulence and wind shear. Â© 2018

TI  - Numerical design and analysis of ocean wave energy generator
AB  - Ocean energy is the utmost economically realistic solution for providing energy to the inshore areas. Wave energy generation by the simultaneous model of wave energy generator (WEG) and numerical analysis is being discussed. The concept of renewable energy is to convert various energy into electrical energy. Ocean wave energy is one of them which convert mechanical stress into electric energy. Installing WEG at inshore areas can be generated power, without consuming fuel and other resources. To analyze the mechanical system of WEG transform into the electrical circuit and enhance the accuracy and analysis method for wave energy. The floaters are forced to oscillate when ocean waves pass by, thus translator oscillates at the stator field converting the power of ocean waves into electrical energy. Â© 2019 IEEE.

TI  - Deep learning for wave height classification in satellite images for offshore wind access
AB  - Measuring wave heights has traditionally been associated with physical buoy tools that aim to measure and average multiple wave heights over a period of time. With our method, we demonstrate a process of utilizing large-scale satellite images to classify a wave height with a continuous regressive output using a corresponding input for close shore sea. We generated and trained a convolutional neural network model that achieved an average loss of 0.17 m (Fig. 8). Providing an inexpensive and scalable approach for uses in multiple sectors, with practical applications for offshore wind farms. Â© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

TI  - Evaluating a novel control strategy to improve the performance of hydraulic power take-offs in wave energy converters
AB  - The aim of this paper is to present a solution for oil-hydraulic Power Take-Offs (PTOs) employed in Wave Energy Converters (WECs) in order to increase the average pressure produced by cylinders in various incident wave groups. Hydraulic cylinders must be handled in order to operate near or above 210 bar while they are attached to axial piston pumps and their efficiency drops significantly for pressure levels below this one. The main design argument is to find a solution for increasing the average pressure produced by the cylinder when operating with lower sea states and decrease it when running at the higher ones. A control strategy based on time series prediction of pressure in the cylinder is employed to switch between operation modes of the cylinder in different situations. The controller takes the advantage of neural networks to predict the pressure inside chambers and switch the modes to keep the average pressure in an optimum level.

TI  - Sea-level change: The expected economic cost of protection or abandonment in the United States
AB  - Three distinct models from earlier work are combined to: (1) produce probabilistically weighted scenarios of greenhouse-gas-induced sea-level rise; (2) support estimates of the expected discounted value of the cost of sea-level rise to the developed coastline of the United States, and (3) develop reduced-form estimates of the functional relationship between those costs to anticipated sea-level rise, the cost of protection, and the anticipated rate of property-value appreciation, Four alternative representations of future sulfate emissions, each tied consistently to the forces that drive the initial trajectories of the greenhouse gases, are considered. Sea-level rise has a nonlinear effect on expected cost in all cases, bur the estimated sensitivity falls short of being quadratic. The mean estimate for the expected discounted cost across the United States is approximately \$2 billion (with a 3\% real discount rate), but the range of uncertainty around that estimate is enormous; indeed, the 10th and 90th percentile estimates run from less than \$0.2 billion up to more than \$4.6 billion, In addition, the mean estimate is very sensitive to associated sulfate emissions; it is, specifically, diminished by nearly 25\% when base-case sulfate emission trajectories are considered and by more than 55\% when high-sulfate trajectories are allowed.

TI  - Optimization Planning for Large-Scale Offshore Wind Farms using Multi-terminal HVDC Transmission System
AB  - In this paper, a new approach has been proposed to determinant the optimum transmission plan and selection criteria of high potential onshore wind farm using multi-terminal HVDC network. The technique tests different configuration of the system that includes selecting of wind farms location, MT-HVDC network to transmit the wind energy and compare their corresponding power transmission, harvested energy and investment cost. This approach provide very flexible solution depend on the specified requirement such as number of wind farms, total installed power, number of connected onshore stations and many other selection criteria and it sufficient to be used for long term wind energy planning to make an investment decision. A study case has been show where five offshore wind speed data are available and optimum three locations will be selected considering the most efficient MT-HVDC transmission topology.

TI  - A Natural-Artificial Power-Industrial system based on wave energy conversion
AB  - Lately, because of limitedness of organic power resources and requirements to ecological purity, the solution of a problem of power production growth is more often connected with the use of renewable power resources. Among renewable power sources the ocean waves is a very promising power carrier since they manifest the highest specific power. The functioning of a Natural-Artificial Power-Industrial system is examined. The main elements of it are: - A nature's heat machine, creating the ocean waves; - A Float Wave Electric Power Station, converting wave's energy into electricity; - An electrolyzer, utilizing electricity and sea water, as a means of hydrogen production; - Energy storage and energy consumers. The system is treated from energetic, ecological and economic viewpoints. Copyright Â© 1999 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.

TI  - Membrane-Permeation Modeling for Carbon Capture from CO2-Rich Natural Gas
AB  - This chapter contemplates two topics committed to steady-state modeling of membrane-permeation units for decarbonation of CO2-rich natural gas at high-pressure. The first topic presents a steady-state, phenomenological, and one-dimensional distributed membrane-permeation simulation modelâ€”SPM2010â€”which was developed in MATLAB 2010 for rigorous simulation of CO2 removal and natural gas purification flowsheets using membrane-permeation batteries operating with hollow-fiber membranes and parallel retentate/permeate flows. SPM2010 solves mass/momentum/energy balances of permeate and retentate non-isothermal, non-isobaric compressible flows rendering several graphical results. The second topic comprehends simulation models of membrane-permeation units appropriate for insertion in gas processing flowsheets solved by professional process simulators, such as HYSYS 10.0. These HYSYS extension models are grouped into two types, both solving mass/energy balances of permeate/retentate for hollow-fiber and spiral-wound membranes: (i) Lumped models for parallel and counter-current permeate/retentate flows using average driving forces and lumped balances; (ii) one-dimensional distributed models for parallel permeate/retentate flows using distributed driving forces and balances. The major findings of this chapter correspond to the development of two categories of membrane-permeation models (respectively, in Sects. 2 and 3), respectively, appropriate for two computing platformsâ€”MATLAB and HYSYSâ€”and sufficiently accurate for designing real permeation systems for CO2 removal from CO2-rich natural gas at high pressure. Both categories of models were calibrated with real data of CO2 permeation batteries belonging to offshore rigs operating in the pre-salt basin in the southeast coast of Brazil.

TI  - Distribution characteristics of active organic carbon components in sediments of typical community types of mangrove wetland in Qinglan Port [æ¸…æ¾œæ¸¯çº¢æ ‘æž—æ¹¿åœ°å…¸åž‹ç¾¤è½ç±»åž‹æ²‰ç§¯ç‰©æ´»æ€§æœ‰æœºç¢³ç»„åˆ†åˆ†å¸ƒç‰¹å¾]
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems in tidal flats usually contain a large proportion of soil nutrients, especially organic carbon content in sediments. The basic research on organic carbon components of the sediments in the large variety of luxuriant mangrove forests in Hainan Island can help more accurately evaluate the carbon sequestration capacity of mangrove wetlands and improve the knowledge about marine blue carbon. This paper comparatively analyzes the different contents of total organic carbon (TOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), easily oxidized organic carbon (EOC), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the topsoil (0â€”10 cm) in five typical populations of mangrove in Qinglan Port and their correlation with soil factors. The result shows that (1) the average contents of TOC, MBC, DOC and EOC in the surface soils in different populations of mangrove are 66.76 g/ kg, 177.08 mg/ kg, 25.49 mg/ kg, and 2.34 g/ kg, respectively. According to the comparative analysis, the content of TOC is the highest in the soil in the Ceriops tagal community, but it is not significantly different among all the communities;The content of MBC in the soil is significantly different among all flora communities, where the content of MBC in the soil in Ceriops tagal community and Sonneratia alba community is much higher than that in Lumnitzera racemosa community. The content of DOC in the soil in all communities is significantly different, where the content of DOC in the soil in Bruguiera sexangula community and Ceriops tagal community is much higher than that in other communities. The content of EOC in the soil in all communities is significantly different, where the content of EOC in the soil in Ceriops tagal community is much higher than that in Bruguiera sexangula community and Rhizophora Apiculata community. (2) The average ratio of active organic carbon components to total organic carbon in MBC is higher than in DOC, and that in EOC is the highest. The distribution ratios of EOC, MBC and DOC in soil are between 3.23% and 4.02%, 0.22% and 0.36%, and 0.02% and 0.08% respectively. (3) Redundancy analysis shows that total nitrogen (TN) in soil is more justified to exclusively prove organic carbon components in the soil. Soil pH is less justified to exclusively prove the organic carbon component in the soil. (4) TOC, MBC, DOC and EOC in soil are positively correlated with soil TN and soil water content (SWC). In conclusion, tidal level soil physical and chemical properties caused by different biotic communities jointly affect the concentration of soil active organic carbon components.

TI  - Control and protection sequence for recovery and reconfiguration of an offshore integrated MMC multi-terminal HVDC system under DC faults
AB  - A comprehensive process of the control and protection against a DC fault in a voltage source converter (VSC) based high-voltage direct current (HVDC) system typically includes fault detection, fault isolation and system recovery. Regarding an offshore wind farm (OWF) integrated modular multilevel converter (MMC) based multi-terminal HVDC (MTDC) system with two control paradigms, i.e. master-slave control and droop control under DC faults, this paper presents the fault isolation, including the isolation of the faulted line section, with detailed control and protection sequence, which would be useful for practical engineering. The control and protection sequence at the system recovery/reconfiguration phase is comprehensively investigated, which includes: (1) when to start the recovery/reconfiguration control; (2) the sequence between deblocking the MMCs and reclosing the AC circuit breakers (AC CBs); and (3) the recovery sequence of each HVDC terminal. Based on the analysis of the system characteristics, a preferred recovery/reconfiguration scheme is proposed. Simulation results on the real-time digital simulator (RTDS) validate the proposed scheme and demonstrate the advantages through comparison with a different recovery sequence. The impact of transient and permanent DC faults on the system recovery/reconfiguration control is discussed. In addition, the recovery/reconfiguration control of the MTDC in radial and meshed topologies is compared and demonstrated. Based on the analytical and simulation studies, a general guideline on the recovery/reconfiguration control of MMC MTDC systems is proposed. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Solar Hybrid Power System for Marine Diesel Engine: UMT Vessel Experience
AB  - Like all modes of transportation that use fossil fuels, ships produce carbon dioxide emissions that significantly contribute to global climate change and ocean acidification. Additionally, ships release other pollutants that also contribute to the problem and exacerbate climate change. Considering the large volume of ships on the high seas, ship emissions pose a significant threat to human health. The ocean is exposed to vast amounts of sunrays and has a great potential to be explored by the maritime sector and green power industry. Solar energy hybrid assisted power to support auxiliary power for the instruments on board the vessel is explored in a UMT vessel. The vessel that is used in this case study is Discovery XI, which is a 16.50 meter diving boat owned by University Malaysia Terengganu. The study explores the feasibility of using solar energy as a supporting power for marine vessel auxiliaries. The reduction of fuel usage after installing the solar PV system on the boat is determined, as well as an economic analysis. The power requirement for the vessel's electrical system is estimated. The fuel and money saved is also estimated for comparison purposes of the vessel using the solar PV system and the vessel without the PV system. Economic analyses are performed, the Annual Average Cost (AAC) between a vessel using solar PV system and a vessel without solar PV system is estimated, and the period of the return of investment for the vessel with solar PV system is also estimated. The use of a photovoltaic solar system to assist the boat power requirement will benefit the environment through Green House Gas (GHG) reduction, and the use of solar as a supporting alternative energy could cut the cost of boat operation through fuel savings.

TI  - CCS Acceptability: Social Site Characterization and Advancing Awareness at Prospective Storage Sites in Poland and Scotland
AB  - This paper summarizes the work on the social dimension conducted within the EU FP7 SiteChar project. The most important aim of the research was to advance public awareness and draw lessons for successful public engagement activities when developing a CO2 storage permit application. To this end, social site characterization (e.g. representative surveys) and public participation activities (focus conference) were conducted at two prospective Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) sites: an onshore site in Poland and an offshore site in Scotland. The research consisted of four steps over a time period of 1.5 year, from early 2011 to mid-2012. The first step consisted of four related qualitative and quantitative research activities to provide a social characterization of the areas: desk research, stakeholder interviews, media analyses, and a survey among representative samples of the local community. The aim was to identify: stakeholders or interested parties; factors that may drive their perceptions of and attitudes towards CCS. Results were used to as input for the second step, in which a new format for public engagement named `focus conferences' was tested at both sites involving a small sample of the local community. The third step consisted of making available generic as well as site-specific information to the general and local public, by: setting up a bilingual set of information pages on the project website suitable for a lay audience; organizing information meetings at both sites that were open to all who took interest. The fourth step consisted of a second survey among a new representative sample of the local community. The survey was largely identical to the survey in step 1 to enable the monitoring of changes in awareness, knowledge and opinions over time. Results provide insight in the way local CCS plans may be perceived by the local stakeholders, how this can be reliably assessed at early stage without raising unnecessary concerns, and how results of this inventory can be used to develop effective local communication and participation strategies. In future project development, if any, these results can be used to start up and inform the process of information provision and public engagement.

TI  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND PROCEDURAL ASPECTS OF THE SEVERN BARRAGE.
AB  - This paper reviews developments in the Severn Barrage project in the Cardiff-Weston location concerned with environmental and planning issues. The environment of the Severn Estuary may be viewed inter alia as a combination of physical and social considerations. The physical environment has marine and terrestrial aspcts, and the social environment reflects the regional nature of the project. Both physical and social aspects must be considered to provide information to permit decisions to be taken. Planning of the project in this context covers those matters which are needed to provide this legislation and framework to permit construction.

TI  - Resolving community metabolism of eelgrass Zostera marina meadows by benthic flume-chambers and eddy covariance in dynamic coastal environments
AB  - Sediment resuspension is a common process in dynamic coastal settings, but its implications for remineralization and carbon turnover in seagrass meadows are poorly understood. Here, we assessed eelgrass Zostera marina metabolism in the Baltic Sea (SW Finland) using benthic flume-chambers and aquatic eddy covariance to critically evaluate the drivers of benthic O-2 exchange during dynamic flow conditions. During quiescent weather conditions, the 2 methods resolved similar metabolic rates and net ecosystem autotrophy (+/- 11\% of each other). However, elevated flow speeds and sediment resuspension halfway through the study induced a 5-fold increase in the O-2 uptake rates measured by eddy covariance, whereas chamber fluxes remained relatively unchanged. Following particle resettlement, instruments were redeployed and the benthic O-2 uptake resolved by both techniques was just similar to 30\% of the values measured before resuspension. Laboratory investigations revealed sediment resuspension could potentially increase benthic O-2 uptake up to 6-fold, mainly due to the reoxidation of reduced compounds (e.g. FeSx). This process was fully captured by the eddy O-2 fluxes, but not by the chamber incubation. Consequently, the chamber and eddy net ecosystem metabolism amounted to - 17 and -824 mmol C m(-2), respectively, throughout the study period. The rapid reoxidation and long-term effects of resuspension on benthic O-2 dynamics highlight the importance of fully capturing dynamic conditions when assessing the overall carbon turnover in coastal habitats. Future studies on the biogeochemical functioning of coastal environments should aim to capture the natural frequency and duration of resuspension events.

TI  - Increased energy efficiency in short sea shipping through decreased time in port
AB  - According to a range of assessments, there exists a large cost-effective potential to increase energy efficiency in shipping through reduced speed at sea enabled by shorter time in port. This means that the energy needed can be reduced whilst maintaining the same transport service. However, the fact that a large cost-effective potential has been identified that is not being harnessed by decision-makers in practice suggests that there is more to this potential to understand. In this paper, the possibilities for increasing energy efficiency by reducing waiting time in port are explored and problematised through a case study of a short sea bulk shipping company transporting dry bulk goods mainly in the North and Baltic seas. Operational data from two ships in the company's fleet for one year showed that the ships spent more than 40\% of their time in ports and that half of the time in port was not productive. The two most important reasons for the large share of unproductive time were that ports were closed on nights and weekends and that ships arrived too early before the stevedores were ready to load or unload the cargo. Reducing all of the unproductive time may be difficult, but the results also show that even a conservative estimate of one to four hours of reduced time per port call would lead to a reduction in energy use of 2-8\%. From in-depth interviews with employees of the shipping company, ports and ship agencies, a complex picture is painted when attempting to understand how this potential arises. Aspects such as a lack of effective ship-shore-port communication, little time for ship operators, an absence of means for accurately predicting energy use of voyages as a function of speed, perceived risk of arriving too late, and relationships with third-party technical management may all play a role.

TI  - SPOWTT: Improving the safety and productivity of offshore wind technician transit
AB  - This paper describes the SPOWTT project. The intention of this project was to understand how sailing by crew transfer vessel (CTVs) to offshore wind farms affects the mental and physical wellbeing of individuals on board. The focus was on quantifying this impact, understanding the key drivers, with an aim to ensuring personnel can arrive to the wind turbines in a fit state to work safely and effectively. Impacts looked at subjective state beyond simply vomiting. Key results include the ability now to predict vessel motions from given Metocean conditions and vessel designs. We also discovered that the impact of vessel motions on seasickness is different for different symptoms and is driven not only by vertical z-axis accelerations but also by certain frequencies of motion in the y-axis. Frequencies other than 0.16 Hz were found to be impactful, and x-axis movements appeared to have a longer-lasting effect on the day's work. Through the formulation of a new, evidence-based understanding of seasickness, we have created an operational planning tool, designed to have a direct benefit on the safety and productivity of offshore wind farm operations.

TI  - The Impact of Life on Climate Stabilization Over Different Timescales
AB  - Surface life has been argued to be crucial in keeping a planet habitable in the long term. Biologically enhanced weathering compensates for increasing solar luminosity, and temperature-dependent plant productivity weakens climate perturbations. Furthermore, a reduced calcification rate of marine organisms provides a negative feedback to rising atmospheric CO2. Here, I present a model of the long-term carbon cycle including biological enhancement of weathering and marine calcification. Climate oscillations of periods from thousands to millions of years arise from a simple model of mountain uplift and erosion. I systematically study the influence of the biologically driven feedbacks on damping these oscillations. For oscillations of periods<2 Myr, the marine calcification feedback yields surface temperature amplitudes that are approximately 1/3 lower compared to a model that ignores this feedback. Abiotic oceans, however, would not necessarily imply a less stable climate on short timescales, due to a higher pH and thereby a higher buffer capacity. On longer timescales, the higher ocean pH would reduce climate stability, since the seafloor weathering feedback would work less efficiently. Biological enhancement of weathering helps stabilizing the climate against oscillations of periods>0.5 Myr. These findings are sensitive to the ratio of land to oceans, however. Furthermore, the mantle carbon degassing rate plays a role, since the temperature dependence of biological primary productivity may be smaller at higher temperatures. Altogether, life can be argued to stabilize the climate on timescales longer than some 100 kyr, while details depend on the geological state of the planet.

TI  - Evaluation of power generation system utilizing ocean methane hydrate and chemical carbon capture and storage system
AB  - A power generation system with low CO2 emission utilizing methane hydrate (MH) is proposed in this study. Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technique is employed to reduce the CO2 emission. The performance of this system was evaluated by using a static process simulator. The power generation system is based on the Brayton cycle and is comprised of a compressor, gas turbine, and combustor, all of which can fit in the limited space available on the vessel which is anchored over the MH reservoir. In CCS, the emitted CO2 was absorbed by amine which is typical chemical absorbent of CO2. The performance of the amine was evaluated in this study. The calculation result shows that the thermal efficiency of the system is decreased with the increment of the pressure because of the mechanical work of the compressor. The thermal efficiency of the system using the amine absorption system was increased about 15% than that of the system with the direct dissolving system. When the flow rate of CH4 was 5,000 kg/h, the output power of the system was 30,000 kW that was the feasible value for energy supplying system.

TI  - A Multi-Disciplinary Approach to select the optimum infill-well location for efficient Reservoir Management of a mature field
AB  - A Multi-Disciplinary Approach (MDA), combining geological characterization, various reservoir property data and production behavior of offset wells, was applied to an unconsolidated sand reservoir to review proposed drilling locations and recommend an optimal well location for improved recovery and effective Reservoir Management (RM). This paper presents a case study where integrated subsurface analysis saved reservoir damage and multi-million dollars in drilling expense, by avoiding a previously approved horizontal well location and selecting an appropriate drilling location. Seismic amplitude anomalies were investigated by integrating with well-cross-sections along the neighboring wells. Geological and petrophysical information, such as, structure maps, log character, reservoir thickness, sand distribution, NTG, porosity, hydrocarbon pore volume, proximity to gas cap or water zone, and fluid-flow conduits, were analyzed to characterize the reservoir zone, which is contributing to well production. Interference among the wells was studied in detail for an optimal development strategy. Bubble maps (based on cumulative production plot), well performance analysis, distance between wells and reserve evaluation based on field data were investigated to arrive at an informed decision regarding infill location. In addition, the well history and reservoir characterization were reviewed in detail and integrated with the production analysis. Integrated analyses using the geological maps and production data showed that higher production correlates directly to the higher pore volume and permeability areas of the maps. The results included show that rock quality is as important as the hydrocarbon saturations in contributing to the production of the field. The reservoir quality maps, fluid contacts, and fault framework helped significantly to identify the higher risks associated with the proposed location. It was recommended to not drill at this high-risk location, contributing to a significant saving of multi-million dollars in Capex. The significant savings in Capex made from the recommendation to not drill the high risk location was helpful to plan a replacement drilling location based on integrated subsurface analysis.

TI  - Small scale standalone solar and tidal hybrid power system in isolated area
AB  - The source of electricity supply in isolated areas is commonly from diesel or other fossil fuel-based generation systems. However, the increasing cost and harmful emissions of these fuels have led researchers to seek alternative solutions in providing electricity. Hence, harnessing renewable resources can be a favourable solution in lowering the dependency on fossil fuels. The Strait of Malacca is blessed with tidal current energy, a research was conducted to design a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) that consists of tidal current and solar energy as its sources along with backup power such as generators to support the electrical demand of a lighthouse. A simulation method is used to determine and compare the optimal configuration of the HRES with the diesel generator-based system. An evaluation of all possible scenarios of standalone systems was carried out by considering the amount of fuel consumption and pollutant emittance, capacity shortage, excess electricity production, unmet energy and renewable fraction parameters of each system scenario. From the findings, the hybrid energy system of Scenario A that consists of tidal turbines, PVs, generator, battery, and converter produces better results where the diesel fuel consumption can be reduced up to 84% in comparison with the standalone generator-based system.

TI  - Forty years wind wave power assessment in the high-energy region of Persian Gulf
AB  - The high-energy region of Persian Gulf is investigated due to wave energy level, distribution direction, and stability over 40Â years. For this purpose, 40-year ECMWF (ERA-Interim) wind data and GEBCO hydrographic data were used as the inputs for SWAN numerical model, and the wave characteristics and wave power were obtained. For detailed investigations, 15 points were considered to investigate in the high-energy area of the region which was introduced in previous research projects. A linear fit method between Buoy data and modeled data was used to increase the accuracy of the results. Finally, concluded that the northwest part of the middle region of Persian Gulf has had the highest average energy and power level, the southeast part is more sustainable and Optimum Hotspot Identifier and Sustainability Index for Wave Power parameters of this region have a higher value. Results showed that the wave power in the study region has an increasing trend by approximately a mean change rate of 0.03 (kW/mÂ year), and there was an increase in energy level in the western and central parts of region during these 40Â years. It was also found that the autumn and winter seasons had the lowest and highest level of power, respectively, and the amount of power in the autumn is approximately half that in the winter. The coefficient of determination (R2) is calculated and concluded that the wave power change rate correlates with a significant wave height change rate than the peak period change rate.

Marine Current Turbines has developed the SeaGen turbines that can generate almost as much electricity as the Severn dam but with less capital investment, power variation, and environmental impact. Ocean Power Delivery will soon begin reaping 2.25 MW off the coast of Portugal from three of its 120-meter long Pelamis machines. The machine works much like an underwater windmill, with two rotors sharing a single mast cemented into the seabed. Tide farm planned by Marine Current Turbines would use an array of turbines spaced more closely than wind generators. The rotors, each up to 20 meters in diameter, drop to sap energy from tidal currents but can surface for servicing.

TI  - Improved accuracy of laser-assisted airgap surveys offshore
AB  - Phillips Petroleum Company Norway (PPCoN) regularly monitors the airgap of all subsiding offshore platforms in the Ekofisk field, located in the central North Sea. Subsidence causes the elevation of the platform decks to decrease with respect to the Mean Sea Level. This if of great concern. Expensive platform remedial work may become necessary if the amount of subsidence becomes too large and the platform airgap too small. The airgap is the distance between the crest of the design wave (related to the Mean Sea Level) and the lowest point of the main cellar deck beams. Short term Laser water level measurements are used in combination with seabed pressure gauge measurements to obtain an accurate platform elevation with respect to the Mean Sea Level, from which the airgap can be computed. Actual data are presented and interpreted to obtain specifications for airgap surveys to obtain dated airgap values of known and optimum accuracy. In particular, recent improvements to the laser measurement system and the interpretation procedures will be discussed, which reduce the R.M.S (Root Mean Square) Error levels of the survey results to approximately +/-7 cm. The airgap measurements are also used to confirm reservoir subsidence predictions which predict when airgap closure occurs-and expensive remedial work such as a jackup operation must be completed.

TI  - Investigation of the possibilities to improve hydrodynamic performances of micro-hydrokinetic turbines
AB  - Horizontal axis turbines are commonly used for harnessing renewable hydrokinetic energy, contained in marine and river currents. In order to encourage the expansion of electricity generation using micro-hydrokinetic turbines, several design improvements are investigated. Firstly, optimization-based design of rotor blade is used to get as close as possible to the efficiency limit of 59.3% (known as Betz limit), that counts for bare turbine rotors, placed in the free flow. Additional diffuser elements are further added to examine the potential to overcome the theoretical efficiency limit by accelerating water at the axial direction. Various diffuser geometrical configurations are investigated using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to obtain insight into hydrodynamics of augmented micro-hydrokinetic turbines. Moreover, the turbines are compared from the energy conversion efficiency point of view. The highest maximum power coefficient increase of 81% is obtained with brimmed (flanged) diffuser. Diffusers with foil-shaped cross-sections have also been analyzed but power augmentation is not significantly greater than in the case of simple cross-section designs of the same dimensions. The power coefficients' comparison indicate that considerable power augmentation is achievable using brimmed diffuser with higher value of length-to-diameter ratio. However, the impact of diffuser length increase on the power coefficient enhancement becomes weaker as the length-to-diameter ratio reaches a value of 1. Â© 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Current status and perspectives of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant design
AB  - Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is attracting great interest as a clean energy alternative to other fossil fuels, mainly due to its ease of transport and low carbon dioxide emissions, a primary factor in air pollution and global warming. It is expected that this trend in the use of LNG will lead to steady increases in demand over the next few decades. To meet the growing demand for LNG, natural gas liquefaction plants have been constructed across the globe. Furthermore, single train capacity has been increased to strengthen price competitiveness. To achieve greater capacity, more complex refrigeration cycle designs that combine two or more different conventional single refrigeration cycles are being developed to obtain synergistic effects in the liquefaction process. At the same time, a variety of recent studies have focused on designing suitable processes for offshore and small-scale plants to improve the profitability of stranded gas fields. LNG plants are known to be energy/cost-intensive, as they require a large amount of power for the processes of compression and refrigeration, and need special equipment such as cryogenic heat exchangers, compressors, and drivers. Therefore, one of the primary challenges in the LNG industry is to improve the efficiency of the current natural gas liquefaction processes in combination with cost savings. In this paper, we review recent developments in LNG processes, with an emphasis on commercially available refrigeration cycles. We also discuss recent research and suggest future directions for natural gas liquefaction processes. Up to this point, most studies have focused on operating cost. To achieve better results, future studies that investigate optimal design and operation of LNG technologies should consider both capital cost and operating cost. Â© 2012 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Transient Protection Schemes for Transmission Lines Used in Offshore Wind Farm: A State-of-the-Art Review
AB  - The weak feeder and high harmonic characteristics of wind farms connected to the grid have an impact on the safe operation of the system, especially on the action selectivity and reliability of the traditional work-frequency quantity protection, which makes the transient protection of wind farms become a hot direction of wind power development and research. In this article, the key technologies of transient protection for offshore wind farm transmission lines are reviewed, including the analysis of the fault characteristics of wind farm transmission lines based on two types of wind turbines (i.e., doubly fed asynchronous wind turbines and direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous generators), while the comparison with the characteristics of ground faults and short-circuit faults in traditional synchronous power systems as well as the current status of research on transient protection for offshore wind farm transmission lines, upon which the protection of wind farm transmission lines is also discussed.

TI  - Potential use of the Caribbean spider crab Maguimithrax spinosissimus for biofouling removal on marine aquaculture cages
AB  - Biofouling is a significant issue on marine aquaculture pens and is conservatively estimated to contribute to 15\% of production costs. With a global increase in the demand for sustainable aquaculture products a search for sustainable non-toxic alternatives to chemical treatment and manual removal of biofouling organisms, such as biological control, are becoming more sought after. In the laboratory experiments Caribbean spider crabs (Maguimithrax spinosissimus) exhibited nocturnal patterns of activity. They consumed between 3.3 and 4.16\% bodyweight (BW) of algae in 22-24 degrees C water, and between 5.61 and 8.55\% BW in 26-28 degrees C water. Although this species is primarily herbivorous they also readily consumed whole fish (Lutjanus apodus). The spider crabs were placed on a heavily fouled, unoccupied SeaStation 3000 cage offshore of Eleuthera, The Bahamas, to determine their ability to remove fouling organisms. Large crabs (382 g - 1344 g) confined in mesh cages on the outside of the pen effectively removed between 40\% (after two weeks), and 90\% (after four weeks) of fouling organisms. Crabs were more effective at removing growth than manual scrubbing by a diver. Grazing by the crabs was nondiscriminatory, with no significant change in the proportional makeup of epibionts at the end of the trial. The survival rates of crabs inside the cage varied between 50\% and 55\% when not including escapees, and between 66\% and 94\% when including escapees during 3 to 6 month trials, with no significant decline in health status (blood protein levels). The Caribbean spider crab is a good candidate both economically and environmentally for controlling biofouling on aquaculture cages, could be used in multi-trophic aquaculture systems, and marketed as an environmentally friendly seafood.

TI  - Assessing fatigue life of corroded mooring chains through advanced analysis
AB  - Evaluation of corroded chain link for continued use or life extension is a challenging task for the industry. ABS, together with fifteen (15) participating organizations, initiated the Fatigue of Corroded Chains (FoCCs) Joint Industry Project (JIP) in 2016. The objective of the FoCCs JIP is to investigate methodologies for assessing remaining fatigue life of the corroded mooring chain used for floating production systems. The JIP scope includes fatigue testing in labs and finite element analysis (FEA) of corroded chain samples retrieved from six floating production facilities in West Africa and the North Sea. The participating organizations include oil majors, chain manufactures, consulting firms, and classification societies, which represent a pool of broad range of mooring knowledge and experience. Knowledge gained from the JIP will be summarized and used toward the development of guidance notes for assessing fatigue life of corroded mooring chain for the industry. Six sets of mooring chain samples with different corrosion conditions have been collected, cleaned and digitally scanned for fatigue testing and FEA. Procedures for testing and analysis have been developed with the objective of establishing commonly accepted methods. Different FEA procedures have been studied for making a better prediction of stress ranges of the corroded chain links. The findings from the fatigue testing and FEA will be utilized as basis for further development of the methods for fatigue assessment of corroded mooring chain. This paper summarizes the tests and FE analysis work for the selected chain samples. The JIP research work has found that corrosion, either general corrosion or local/pitting corrosion, can significantly reduce the chain fatigue capacity. The location and the geometry of corrosion pits have more impact on fatigue lives than the pit size. The JIP study has shown that FE analysis is an effective tool to capture the hot spot of corroded chain links and can provide insight in their fatigue performance. Different methods on the assessment of the stress range of a hot spot are compared and discussed. Copyright Â© 2019, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - Fractional-Order PI Controller for DFIG-Based Marine Tidal Current Applications
AB  - This paper deals with the current and speed control of a Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG)-based marine tidal current applications. DFIG has been already considered for similar applications, particularly wind turbine systems using mainly Integer-Order PI (IOPI) controller. However, such kinds of controllers do not adequately handle DFIG parameter variations under the harsh marine environment and decrease the system performances. As a result, to increase the generated power and the efficiency of the system, Fractional-Order PI (FOPI) controller, which is developed from the conventional IOPI controller and fractional calculus theory, is proposed in this paper. This FOPI controller has the outstanding advantages in terms of stability, robustness and dynamic performance. The proposed control strategy is inserted into a global simulation tool that accounts for the resource and the marine turbine models. The simulation comparisons between IOPI and FOPI controllers are presented and analyzed. Â© 2018 IEEE.

TI  - MODEL TESTS FOR A FLOATING WINDTURBINE ON THREE DIFFERENT FLOATERS
AB  - Wind energy is a promising alternate energy resource. However, the on-land wind farms are limited by space, noise, and visual pollution, and therefore many countries build wind farms near shore. Up to now, most of offshore wind farms have been built in relatively shallow water (less than 30m) with fixed tower type wind turbines. Recently, several countries plan to move wind farms to deep water offshore locations to find stronger and steadier wind fields as compared to near shore locations. For the wind farms in deeper water, floating platforms have been proposed to support the wind turbine. The model tests described in this paper were performed at MARIN (Maritime Research Institute Netherlands) with a model set-up corresponding to a 1:50 Froude scaling. The wind turbine was a scaled model of the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) 5MW, horizontal axis reference wind turbine supported by three different generic floating platforms: a spar, a semi-submersible and a tension-leg platform (TLP). The wave environment used in the tests is representative of the offshore in the state of Maine. In order to capture coupling between the floating platform and the wind turbine, the 1st bending mode of the turbine tower was also modeled. The main purpose of the model tests was to generate data on coupled motions and loads between the three floating platforms and the same wind turbine for the operational, design, and survival seas states. The data are to be used for calibration and improvement of existing design analysis and performance numerical codes. An additional objective of the model tests was to establish advantages and disadvantages among the three floating platform concepts on the basis of test data. The paper gives details of the scaled model wind turbine and floating platforms, the set-up configurations, and the instrumentation to measure motions, accelerations and loads as well as wind turbine rpm, torque and thrust for the three floating wind turbines. The data and data analysis results are the subject of another paper in this conference {[}1].

TI  - Tripod suction caisson foundations for offshore wind energy and their monotonic and cyclic responses in silty sand: Numerical predictions for centrifuge model tests
AB  - Bucket foundations have been increasingly used to support offshore wind turbines as alternatives to monopiles and can be classified into two types: monopod and tripod/jacket supported on multiple shallow foundations. Despite the recent research on the bearing capacity and stiffness of skirted foundations, knowledge regarding the monotonic and cyclic responses of multiple bucket foundation systems in saturated sand is scarce. In this study, the angular rotation of mono-bucket and tripod foundation systems in dense sand due to drained monotonic and cyclic loading was analyzed by performing a series of three-dimensional finite element (FE) analyses. The Hardening Soil Model with Small Strain Stiffness (HS small) and the UBC3D-PLM soil model were employed to analyze the moment response of offshore foundations subjected to wind and wave loading. The procedures were validated against a database of well-documented centrifuge tests. Calibration was carried out based on the monotonic and cyclic model tests, in-situ shear wave velocity measurements, and empirical relationships for shear moduli. Long-term deformations and the resulting decreasing trend in accumulated rotation, which is a unique feature of tripod suction caisson foundations (the so-called â€œself-healingâ€™â€™ mechanism), uncertainties, and nonlinearities in centrifuge tests and numerical predictions involving different alternative calibration scenarios of the models are discussed. Based on the numerical results, a closed-form expression is proposed that enables the prediction of drained bearing capacity of multiple caissons under combined loading. This expression was validated for a range of embedment ratios. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Iron enrichment stimulates toxic diatom production in high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll areas
AB  - Oceanic high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll environments have been highlighted for potential large-scale iron fertilizations to help mitigate global climate change. Controversy surrounds these initiatives, both in the degree of carbon removal and magnitude of ecosystem impacts. Previous open ocean enrichment experiments have shown that iron additions stimulate growth of the toxigenic diatom genus Pseudonitzschia. Most Pseudonitzschia species in coastal waters produce the neurotoxin domoic acid (DA), with their blooms causing detrimental marine ecosystem impacts, but oceanic Pseudonitzschia species are considered nontoxic. Here we demonstrate that the sparse oceanic Pseudonitzschia community at the high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll Ocean Station PAPA( 50 degrees N, 145 degrees W) produces approximately 200 pg DA L-1 in response to iron addition, that DA alters phytoplankton community structure to benefit Pseudonitzschia, and that oceanic cell isolates are toxic. Given the negative effects of DA in coastal food webs, these findings raise serious concern over the net benefit and sustainability of large-scale iron fertilizations.

TI  - Simulation of pressure-maintaining storage isolated generating system based on wave energy
AB  - Adopting a pressure-maintaining storage system in a wave power station is a new idea for converting the unsteady ocean wave energy input into the steady power output. According to the idea, the implemented system consists of an energy input system, a hydraulic pressure system, a generating system and a control system. In this paper, a mathematical model of the system is established and the computer simulation is done according to the mathematical model. Based on the physical mode, the unsteady wave energy input is simulated by the way of the motor driven by a transducer and the differential PID control algorithm is applied to the control system. The computer and physical mode simulation results show that the system can convert the unsteady energy input into the steady electric energy output. The idea is feasible and valuable for the design of actual systems.

TI  - Application of Solid-State Circuit Breaker in Selective Relay Protection of Marine DC Distribution System
AB  - DC distribution electric propulsion is the trend of ship power development in the future. The problem of selective relay protection for bus-connected equipment has not been properly solved, which directly threatens the safety of navigation. Therefore, on the basis of analyzing the short-circuit fault principle of marine DC distribution system and the simulation and experimental verification, a relay protection scheme using solid-state circuit breaker instead of the bus-tie fast fuse is proposed. The scheme uses high-speed interruption to isolate the impact of fault on bus voltage on the normal side to ensure the continuity of power supply and navigation safety. Finally, the realization method of selective relay protection for DC distribution system and the strategy of power supply recovery after fault are put forward, which meet the requirements of marine power engineering application.

TI  - Model Testing of a Series of Counter-Rotating Type Horizontal-Axis Tidal Turbines With 500 mm Diameter
AB  - Tidal current energy shows great attractive as it stores an enormous amount of predictable sustainable resource that can be extracted and used for the purpose of commercial power generation. The horizontal-axis tidal turbine (HATT) has been proposed as the most effective one among many tidal current energy extraction devices. It is well known that the similarities between horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWTs) and tidal turbines suggest that much can be transferred from the design and operation of wind turbines. In the present work, a series of model counter-rotating type HATTs were designed according to the experience of a counter-rotating type HAWT, and a test rig was constructed. Experimental tests of the hydrodynamic performance in terms of power coefficient were carried out in a circulating water tunnel. Three model turbines consisting of different front and rear blades were analyzed. Experimental results of power coefficient for a range of tip speed ratios (TSRs) and setting angle matches between the front and rear blades for various conditions are presented. Such results provide valuable data for validating the hydrodynamic design and numerical simulations of counter-rotating type HATTs.

TI  - Global potential and limits of mangrove blue carbon for climate change mitigation
AB  - Despite the outsized role of mangrove forests in sustaining biodiversity, ecosystem function, and local livelihoods, the protection of these vital habitats through blue carbon financing has been limited.(1,2) Here, we quantify the extent of this missed conservation and financial opportunity, showing that the protection of-20\% of the world's mangrove forests (2.6 Mha) can be funded through carbon financing. Of these investible areas, 1.1-1.3 Mha can be financially sustainable over a 30-year time frame based on carbon prices of US\$5-9.4 t(-1)CO(2)e. This contributes up to 29.8 MtCO(2)e year(-1) and yields a return on investment of similar to US\$3.7 billion per year. Our results point toward a disproportionately large potential of blue carbon finance that can be leveraged to meet national-level climate mitigation goals, particularly if combined with other conservation interventions that further safeguard carbon stocks and biodiversity in these irreplaceable forests. Robust information on return on investment highlights the potential for currently underutilized tropical coastal carbon credit projects.

TI  - Tom Wigley: Why nuclear power may be the only way to avoid geoengineering
AB  - In this interview, climate scientist Tom Wigley says that waiting to take significant action on climate change makes it more likely that geoengineering will be needed to address the problem. He advocates for research on a combination approach: climate engineering together with mitigation efforts aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Wigley says that geoengineering may become necessary to stabilize global sea level rise, because sea level has much greater inertia than temperatures in the atmosphere. He argues that the climate problem cannot be solved with renewable energy alone, and that, without turning to geoengineering, consideration of the nuclear energy pathway-in particular, resuming the development of fast reactors-should be an essential component of attempts to address the climate crisis. Wigley claims that his colleagues in climate science are generally supportive of nuclear engineering and less fearful of it than they are of geoengineering.

TI  - Analysis of a wave-powered, reverse-osmosis system and its economic availability in the United States
AB  - A wave energy converter (WEC) system has the potential to convert the wave energy resource directly into the highpressure flow that is needed by the desalination system to permeate saltwater through the reverse-osmosis membrane to generate clean water. In this study, a wave-to-water numerical model was developed to investigate the potential use of a wavepowered desalination system (WPDS) for water production in the United States. The model was developed by coupling a time-domain radiation-and-diffraction-method-based numerical tool (WEC-Sim) for predicting the hydrodynamic performance of WECs with a solution-diffusion model that was used to simulate the reverse-osmosis process. To evaluate the feasibility of the WPDS, the wave-to-water numerical model was applied to simulate a desalination system that used an oscillating surge WEC device to pump seawater through the system. The annual water production was estimated based on the wave resource at a reference site on the coast of northern California to investigate the potential cost of water in that area, where the cost of water and electricity is high compared to other regions. In the scenario evaluated, for a 100-unit utility-scale array, the estimated levelized cost of energy for these WECs is about 3-6 times the U.S.'s current, unsubsidized electricity rates. However, with clean water as an end product and by directly producing pressurized water with WECs, rather than electricity as an intermediary, it is presently only 12% greater than typical water cost in California. This study suggests that a WEC array that produces water may be a viable, near-term solution to the nation's water supply, and the niche application of the WPDS may also provide developers with new opportunities to further develop technologies that benefit both the electric and drinking water markets.

TI  - Hydraulic efficiency of a pile-supported free surface breakwater subjected to random waves
AB  - Wave transmission, reflection and energy dissipation characteristics of a pile-supported Free Surface H-type Breakwater (FSHB) were experimentally studied under the action of random waves. Large scale laboratory experiments were conducted using a wave flume. The test models of different drafts were subjected to random waves of varying characteristics in different water depths. The experimental results revealed that the fixed FSHB attenuated the incident waves mainly by wave reflection. The wave suppression ability of the fixed FSHB was significantly enhanced when the breakwater was confronted by steeper waves. Most of the wave energy dissipation was associated with wave trapping between arms of the structure during wave overtopping and the eddies generated under keel of the structure during wave-structure interaction. Furthermore, the results indicated that increase in immersion depth of the structure increased its wave attenuation ability. Â© 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

TI  - Blue carbon reservoir of the blue planet
AB  - The ever increasing emission of carbon dioxide due to rapid industrialization, urbanization, unplanned tourism and alteration of land use pattern is causing unprecedented changes to marine biodiversity. Irrespective of political philosophy, nation, caste, sex and religion, mankind is under the appalling shadow of climate change. Today nature-based approaches for the mitigation of climate change are increasingly accepted as part of the low-cost solution. Thrust has been given by several scientific communities to assess the magnitude and viability of carbon sequestering potential of plants. Coastal producer communities like mangroves, salt marsh grass, seagrass beds, and seaweeds absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide during the process of photosynthesis. This carbon known as the blue carbon is thus associated with the marine and estuarine ecosystems. However, a number of gaps in our scientific knowledge on blue carbon domain still exist. Molluscs, coral reefs, phytoplankton, which are amongst the important storehouses of carbon, have not been addressed. Very few scientific studies on the carbon stored in these valuable natural vaults have been performed, and no data bank is available on their carbon sequestering capacity on global basis. The methodologies for assessing blue carbon stock also need further standardization so that credit from blue carbon reservoir is accepted by the International bodies in the form of a concrete policy. It is a matter of great appreciation that Conservation International (CI), the International Union for Conservation of Natural Resources (IUCN), and the Intergovernmental Oceanic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO is collaborating with governments, research institutions, non-governmental and international organizations, and communities around the world to develop management approaches, financial incentives and policy mechanisms for ensuring conservation and restoration of blue carbon ecosystems and implement projects around the world that demonstrate the feasibility of blue carbon accounting, management, and incentive agreements. The present book has critically presented the data bank for each community of blue carbon not merely in the form of text description, but also through case studies that are the outcomes of research projects and pilot programmes."

TI  - Impact of subsea processing power distribution: Subsea switchgear module - A key enabling component in subsea installations
AB  - Subsea high and low voltage switchgear is a key enabling component for subsea process units. Locating the switchgear module at the heart of the subsea load center avoids having to provide any top-side facilities, greatly reduces the operation expenditures and reduces the cost of the power lines. The subsea environment has a very strong influence on the design, fabrication, assembly and testing of the module, both the enclosure itself and the switchgear equipment inside of the enclosure. After the introduction and some general information regarding the subsea switchgear module, the feasibility study and various conceptual design calculations performed during the development of the switchgear portion will be described. Since this is the first time that such a large electrical distribution system has been installed in a subsea environment, the main purpose of these studies was to ensure a very high availability of the switchgear to provide power to the process loads. Reliability studies combined with mechanical and thermal analyses were performed to ensure correct installation and operation in a subsea environment at about 1000m below sea level. Electromagnetic compatibility studies were also performed to avoid any nuisance operations of the switchgear and controlgear which could result in loss of production. After the information about the switchgear portion, the design, fabrication and testing of the enclosure itself will be described. There are two main criteria for the enclosure. The first is the high pressure due to installation on the seabed. The second is the requirement for the installation of the switchgear within the enclosure prior to its submersion, and also access to the switchgear during maintenance operations at the surface. This criterion requires removable enclosure parts that must have adequate sealing to prevent any leakage when submerged. Also very important are the constraints due to the handling of the complete module when installing it and also when it requires servicing. Finally the integration of the switchgear portion within the enclosure will be described. Copyright 2010, Offshore Technology Conference.

First oil from Gryphon occurred only one year from the time agreement was reached to purchase the FPSO. Such fast-track projects often imply high costs in order to meet short delivery times. The Gryphon project management strategy, implemented a contractual philosophy which did not allow costs to escalate or long timescales.

TI  - Dynamic Rating of Three-Core XLPE Submarine Cables for Offshore Wind Farms
AB  - This article aims to determine the most suitable cross-sectional area for a high voltage alternating current (HVAC) submarine cable in the design phase of new projects. A thermal ladder network method (LNM) was used to analyse the thermal behaviour in the centre of the conductor as the hottest spot of the cable. On the basis of the calculated cable parameters and a thermal cable analysis of transient conditions applied by a step function with a time duration greater than 1 h, this article proposes a method for a dynamic rating of submarine cables. The dynamic rating is accomplished through an iterative process. The method was tested with a MATLAB simulation and validated in comparison with a finite element method (FEM)-based approach.

TI  - Optimal Design of the Cable Layout in Offshore Wind Farms using Firefly Algorithm and Minimum Spanning Tree
AB  - More and more, wind energy is gaining interest in the Kingdom of Morocco as a sustainable energy source. All investments in this type of energy source so far have mainly been concentrated on onshore applications, although Morocco in fact is distinguished by two sea fronts stretching over a length of 3500 km along the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. This is due to the high investment costs and the complicated construction process of offshore wind farms at sea. Electrical infrastructure and offshore substation investment cost inside a wind farm can alone reach 15 - 30% of the total investment cost of the whole project, which is therefore regarded as extremely expensive. Hence, aiming to make offshore wind farms more attractive like onshore ones, we have developed an algorithm based on Clustering, Minimum Spanning Tree and Firefly Optimization, which can significantly decrease the total length of cables and thus its costs in the design phase of the project, and consequently minimize the associated power losses. This article introduces the results of the proposed optimization approach on randomly generated wind turbines in an offshore wind farm. Â© 2021 IEEE.

TI  - Modelling and control of a marine current turbine-driven doubly fed induction generator
AB  - This paper deals with the modelling and control of a variable speed doubly fed induction generator-based marine current turbine with and without tidal current speed sensor. The proposed maximum power point tracking control strategy relies on the resource and the marine turbine models that were validated by experimental data. The sensitivity of the proposed control strategy is analysed regarding the swell effect because it is considered as the most disturbing one for the resource model. Tidal current data from the Raz de Sein (Brittany, France) are used to run simulations of a 7.5-kW prototype over various flow regimes. Simulation results are presented and fully analysed.

TI  - Condensing heat transfer enhancement on vertical spiral double fin tubes with drainage gutters
AB  - Spiral double-fin tubes with drainage gutters are proposed for a vertical condenser to achieve high-condensing heat transfer performance for ocean thermal energy conversion application. There aluminum tubes have 5 or JO spiral primary fins per pitch of spiral drainage fin. The condensation occurs mainly on the 0.8-mm-high primary fins; the 2-mm-high drainage fin collects the condensate from the primary fins, and a vertical drainage gutter removes the condensate from the drainage fin. Thus performance degradation due to accumulation of condensate in the vertical direction is avoided. Experiments were carried out using R-22 (chlorodifluromethane) as the working fluid in a shell using seven aluminum tubes (900 mm in effective length and 20 mm in nominal diameter). The drainage fin pitch, the primary fin pitch, shape of primary fin, and number of drainage gutters per tube were selected as parameters. One of the tubes had a 0.2-mm-thick titanium cladding on the inside (water side). The measured working-fluid-side condensing heat transfer coefficients for these tubes were four to six times those for a smooth tube based on the outer surface area. Â© 1985 by ASME.

TI  - A comparison of platform & seabed mounted flow measurement instrumentation for SME PLAT-I
AB  - Tidal resource assessment for the characterisation of turbine performance or Annual Energy Prediction currently uses the method of bins as recommended by international standards. An alternative method is proposed in this paper and applied to the Sustainable Marine Energy PLAT-I deployment in Connel Sound, Scotland. This method may be suitable for tidal turbines which operate from the surface. Three instrumentation types are used in this work, a bed-mounted Acoustic Doppler Profiler (ADP), and platform-mounted Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) and Electromagnetic Current Meter (ECM). By comparing the resource characteristics from these three sources, a comparison of their velocity magnitudes and turbulence characteristics is made, demonstrating the difference between methodologies. It was found that the ADP evaluated using the method of bins produced a more conservative velocity distribution, in comparison to the ADV and ECM. Consequently, a representative AEP showed a difference of 3.8kWh (50% of ADP total) for the month of data collected. When comparing the Turbulence Intensity between devices, the ADP and ECM had similar metrics whilst the ADV had up to 14% higher values. The significance of these differences requires further work comparing them to the SME PLAT-I turbines power output to ascertain which best represents the onset flow experienced by the turbine and if there is a correlation between power performance and turbulence intensity.

TI  - Identifying and quantifying major hazard for platforms deck raising using synchronous hydraulic jacking system
AB  - Lima Flow Station is one of the gathering manned stations of Pertamina Hulu Energy Offshore North West Java (PHEONWJ) which is located in Java Sea, Indonesia. The Lima Flow Station consists of four bridge linked platforms and a bridge linked flare structure. Lima Flow Station had experienced subsidence for about 3 meters since it was built in 1973 to early 2013. The subsidence caused significant reduction in the platform air gaps (distance between cellar deck bottom of steel and maximum wave height) which caused Lima Flow Station to not be reliable for safe operation. The synchronous hydraulic jacking system was selected to raise the platform to 4 meters elevation and remedy the air gap for safe operation. Three platforms, Flare tripods, and interconnecting bridges were raised while one platform was not raised as it was isolated and utilized as a muster point and for personnel transfer purposes only. The same technology has been successfully applied in Gulf of Mexico in 2006. Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) study was conducted for the design of a synchronous hydraulic jacking system to measure whether the design provided tolerable risk or not and identify mitigation of any intolerable risk. The assessment was carried out in two main parts: hazard identification in the form of failure modes, effects and criticality analysis (FMECA) to determine major accident events to be carried forward into the QRA; and determination of the impact of safety risk to personnel and assessment of financial risks in the form of delays to resumption of production. FMECA was used for qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of engineering systems. The reviewed system was divided into system, subsystem, and equipment. Failure mode, cause, safeguard and effectJconsequence for equipment are identified. High consequence was considered as major accident and was further studied in QRA. QRA consisted of Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) to estimate the probability of a major accident event identified by FMECA, Event Tree Analysis (ETA) to estimate the probability of a major accident leading to the ultimate event, Consequence analysis to estimate the impact of the ultimate event, risk estimation by multiplying probability and impact of ultimate event, risk assessment by comparing estimated risk and risk criteria, and identification of mitigation for any major accident having intolerable risk. FMECA has identified some major accident events caused by misalignment and structural failure during deck rising. The results of the QRA determined that the individual risk per annum for the most exposed individual was still within tolerable risk of company's criteria as the deck raising was conducted during shutdown and minimum manning level. While the financial risk was high for platform damage due to structural failure for lifted platforms as there was no detection method for structural failure and sudden movement in case of structural failure may cause major damage. The financial loss was mostly contributed by production loss. The major contributor for structural failure was weld failure. Recommendation was raised to minimize the risk by providing extra quality check for welding and material of structural parts on fabrication and installation. By implementing good project and risk management, Lima Flow Station Deck Raising has completed successfully and started up in 2013 without any accident. Copyright Â© (2014) by AIChE.

TI  - Mangrove removal: Effects on trace metal concentrations in temperate estuarine sediments
AB  - Trace metal accumulation in mangrove sediments is of increasing global concern, as contaminants can easily remobilise to surrounding environments through a range of sediment geochemistry processes. Such processes are driven by various physical or biological disturbances, which tend to remobilise metals profligately. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of mangrove removal activities on trace metal concentrations in temperate mangrove sediments and adjacent mudflats. To understand patterns of trace metal mobilization due to the removal of mangroves, we measured levels of Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd along with other sediment parameters (organic matter, pH, bulk density) during pre- and post-mangrove removal activities. Sediment cores from three different depths down to 30 cm were collected from the mangrove removal location and adjacent mudflats at Mangawhai Harbour Estuary, New Zealand, during pre/post-removal sampling events over a four-year period. Results indicate that levels of OM and trace metals were higher in mangrove sediments than adjacent mudflats, which is consistent with the inherent capacity of mangrove sediments to sequester trace metals. However, after the removal of mangroves, the levels OM and trace metals decreased in removal sites. During this period, we observed a decrease in OM and lower sediment pH levels, indicating an increase in sediment acidity which is associated with a lower sediment sequestering capacity. We also observed increases in trace metal concentrations in adjacent mudflats during the post-removal period, thus highlighting the far-reaching effects of mangrove removal activities. These findings provide important information to assist with future management strategies of temperate mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - Dynamic modeling of hydrokinetic energy extraction
AB  - The world is facing an imminent energy crisis. In order to sustain our energy supply, it is necessary to advance renewable technologies. Despite this urgency, however, it is paramount to consider the larger environmental effects associated with using renewable resources. Hydropower, in the past, has been seen as a viable resource to examine, given that its basics of mechanical to electrical energy conversion seem to have little effect on the environment. Discrete analysis of dams and in-stream diversion set-ups, although, has shown otherwise. Modifications to river flows and changes in temperature (from increased and decreased flows) cause adverse effects to fish and other marine life because of changes in their adaptive habitat. Recent research has focused on kinetic energy extraction in river flows, which may prove to be more sustainable, as this type of extraction does not involve a large reservoir or large flow modification. The field of hydrokinetic energy extraction is immature; little is known about the devices' performance in the river environment and their risk of impingement, fouling, and suspension of sediments. The governing principles of hydrokinetic energy extraction are presented, along with a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the system. Power extraction methods are compared and CFD model validation is presented. It is clear that more research is required in hydrokinetic energy extraction with an emphasis toward lower environmental and ecological impacts. Â© 2010 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

TI  - Bioengineering a system for the direct production of biological hydrocarbons for biofuels
AB  - This project will develop new bio-engineering technology to use biorenewable feedstocks that are at the chemical level identical to gasoline and diesel fuels, namely biologically-generated hydrocarbons. Plants and some algae have the ability to chemically-reduce atmospheric CO2 to simple hydrocarbons (e.g., n-alkanes and n-alkenes), using sunlight as the source of renewable energy. However, the mechanisms and genetic elements that encode the biocatalysts are unknown.

Large Combustion Directive, ways of reducing the emission of sulphur dioxide to the atmosphere during the generation of electricity were investigated by the Central Electricity Generating Board (C.E.G.B.). Various methods for flue gas desulphurisation (F.G.D.) were examined. As part of this programme, a detailed engineering study was commissioned and carried out for the C.E.G.B. by Foster Wheeler Energy Limited and Flakt/Norsk Viftefabrikk to assess the potential of sea water scrubbing as a FGD technique for a power station location on or near to an estuary. This paper reviews the technique and the likely environmental effects of FGD using the sea water washing process.

TI  - A Novel Piecewise Velocity Control Method Using Passivity-Based Controller for Wave Energy Conversion
AB  - By studying the working principle of a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) method called active phase control (APC), we found that not only was the phase difference between the wave excitation force and the velocity reduced, but also the magnitude of the velocity increased. For the direct-drive wave energy converter with a permanent magnet linear generator (PMLG), the velocity of the PMLG in the no-load state is larger than that in any power generation states. According to this characteristic, a novel piecewise velocity control (PVC) method and its trajectory planning scheme for a sealed-buoy wave energy converter (SBWEC) are proposed to obtain the maximum power extraction condition. Considering the irregularity of ocean waves and that the proposed method needs to frequently change the operating state of the PMLG, a passivity-based controller (PBC) is designed. With energy modification and damping injection, rapid convergence and asymptotic stability of the system are guaranteed, so that the proposed MPPT method can be perfectly implemented. The comparative simulation results for regular and irregular waves demonstrate that it is an effective and promising power control method. Â© 2013 IEEE.

TI  - Wave energy resource in the Estaca de Bares area (Spain)
AB  - The area around Cape Estaca de Bares (the northernmost point of Iberia) presents a great potential for wave energy exploitation owing to its prominent position, with average deepwater wave power values exceeding 40 kW/m. The newly available SIMAR-44 dataset, composed of hindcast data spanning 44 years (1958-2001), is used alongside wave buoy data and numerical modelling to assess this substantial energy resource in detail. Most of the energy is provided by waves from the IV quadrant, generated by the prevailing westerlies blowing over the long Atlantic fetch. Combined scatter and energy diagrams are used to characterise the wave energy available in an average year in terms of the sea states involved. The lion's share is shown to correspond to significant wave heights between 2 and 5 m and energy periods between 11 and 14 s. The nearshore energy patterns are then examined using a coastal wave model (SWAN) with reference to four situations: average wave energy, growing wave energy (at the approach of a storm), extreme wave energy (at the peak of the storm) and decaying wave energy (as the storm recedes). The irregular bathymetry is found to produce local concentrations of wave energy in the nearshore between Cape Prior and Cape Ortegal and in front of Cape Estaca de Bares, with similar patterns (but varying wave power) in the four cases. These nearshore areas of enhanced wave energy are of the highest interest as prospective sites for a wave energy operation. The largest of them is directly in the lee of a large underwater mount west of Cape Ortegal. In sum, the Estaca de Bares area emerges as one of the most promising for wave energy exploitation in Europe. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Carbon capture and storage and the London Protocol: recent efforts to enable transboundary CO2 transfer
AB  - In the absence of new energy policies or supply constraints, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in 2050 will be twice 2007 levels. However, the ETP 2012 2DG Scenario provides a technically achievable, low-cost strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to a level consistent with a 2 degrees C temperature increase. Under the 2DG Scenario, carbon capture and storage (CCS) would contribute just under one-fifth of total emissions reductions by 2050. To enable CCS to contribute at the levels in the 2DG Scenario, rapid growth in the number CCS projects is needed between today and 2020, and then the number of projects must grow steadily through 2050. As well as being a major financial, technical and logistical challenge, this is a significant regulatory challenge. Legal obstacles associated with global CCS deployment must be removed today including the prohibition on transboundary CO2 transfer under the 1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972 (London Protocol). This paper reviews recent international actions to remove this prohibition; undertakes a legal analysis to identify possible options available to contracting parties under international law to allow transborder movement, pending entry into force of a formal, 2009 amendment enabling cross-border transportation of CO2; and makes clear recommendations on the next best approach. It then looks at efforts undertaken by contracting parties and other organisations in 2011 and 2012 to update the 2007 Specific Guidelines for Assessment of Carbon Dioxide Streams for Disposal into Sub-seabed Geological Formations (2007 CO2 Storage Guidelines) in light of the 2009 amendment.

TI  - Conversion of coastal wetlands, riparian wetlands, and peatlands increases greenhouse gas emissions: A global meta-analysis
AB  - Land-use/land-cover change (LULCC) often results in degradation of natural wetlands and affects the dynamics of greenhouse gases (GHGs). However, the magnitude of changes in GHG emissions from wetlands undergoing various LULCC types remains unclear. We conducted a global meta-analysis with a database of 209 sites to examine the effects of LULCC types of constructed wetlands (CWs), croplands (CLs), aquaculture ponds (APs), drained wetlands (DWs), and pastures (PASs) on the variability in CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from the natural coastal wetlands, riparian wetlands, and peatlands. Our results showed that the natural wetlands were net sinks of atmospheric CO2 and net sources of CH4 and N2O, exhibiting the capacity to mitigate greenhouse effects due to negative comprehensive global warming potentials (GWPs; -0.9 to -8.7 t CO2-eq ha(-1) year(-1)). Relative to the natural wetlands, all LULCC types (except CWs from coastal wetlands) decreased the net CO2 uptake by 69.7\%-456.6\%, due to a higher increase in ecosystem respiration relative to slight changes in gross primary production. The CWs and APs significantly increased the CH4 emissions compared to those of the coastal wetlands. All LULCC types associated with the riparian wetlands significantly decreased the CH4 emissions. When the peatlands were converted to the PASs, the CH4 emissions significantly increased. The CLs, as well as DWs from peatlands, significantly increased the N2O emissions in the natural wetlands. As a result, all LULCC types (except PASs from riparian wetlands) led to remarkably higher GWPs by 65.4\%-2,948.8\%, compared to those of the natural wetlands. The variability in GHG fluxes with LULCC was mainly sensitive to changes in soil water content, water table, salinity, soil nitrogen content, soil pH, and bulk density. This study highlights the significant role of LULCC in increasing comprehensive GHG emissions from global natural wetlands, and our results are useful for improving future models and manipulative experiments.

TI  - Wind-driven changes in Southern Ocean residual circulation, ocean carbon reservoirs and atmospheric CO2
AB  - The effect of idealized wind-driven circulation changes in the Southern Ocean on atmospheric CO2 and the ocean carbon inventory is investigated using a suite of coarse-resolution, global coupled ocean circulation and biogeochemistry experiments with parameterized eddy activity and only modest changes in surface buoyancy forcing, each experiment integrated for 5,000 years. A positive correlation is obtained between the meridional overturning or residual circulation in the Southern Ocean and atmospheric CO2: stronger or northward-shifted westerly winds in the Southern Hemisphere result in increased residual circulation, greater upwelling of carbon-rich deep waters and oceanic outgassing, which increases atmospheric pCO2 by âˆ¼20 Î¼atm; weaker or southward-shifted winds lead to the opposing result. The ocean carbon inventory in our model varies through contrasting changes in the saturated, disequilibrium and biogenic (soft-tissue and carbonate) reservoirs, each varying by O(10-100) PgC, all of which contribute to the net anomaly in atmospheric CO2. Increased residual overturning deepens the global pycnocline, warming the upper ocean and decreasing the saturated carbon reservoir. Increased upwelling of carbon- and nutrient-rich deep waters and inefficient biological activity results in subduction of unutilized nutrients into the ocean interior, decreasing the biogenic carbon reservoir of intermediate and mode waters ventilating the Northern Hemisphere, and making the disequilibrium carbon reservoir more positive in the mode waters due to the reduced residence time at the surface. Wind-induced changes in the model carbon inventory are dominated by the response of the global pycnocline, although there is an additional abyssal response when the peak westerly winds change their latitude, altering their proximity to Drake Passage and changing the depth extent of the southward return flow of the overturning: a northward shift of the westerly winds isolates dense isopycnals, allowing biogenic carbon to accumulate in the deep ocean of the Southern Hemisphere, while a southward shift shoals dense isopycnals that outcrop in the Southern Ocean and reduces the biogenic carbon store in the deep ocean.

TI  - Including the reefer chain into genuine beef cold chain architecture based on blockchain technology
AB  - Improving the cold chain system for perishable foods would both increase food safety by maintaining quality and reduce business operation costs by minimizing food loss from inappropriate management. This has led to various attempts to apply blockchain technology (BCT) to the food cold chain, such as IBM's FoodTrust and Alibaba's Food Trust Frameworks. This system is expected to guarantee food traceability and sustainability. In this research, we focused on the importance of maritime and aviation transportation in the entire supply chain, and we established the BCT-based beef cold chain system, which includes the reefer chain. Specifically, we raised the monitoring and physical infrastructure issues at the port (or airport) and maritime (aviation) transportation node and took these into consideration. Additionally, we conducted scenario analysis to investigate the effects of the suggested system. The amount of food losses and the associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are calculated by different scenarios in accordance with the recall recovery time and node where a recall occurrence is recognized. For both import and export models, when the proposed BCT-based beef cold chain platform is applied, the number of discarded reefer containers and the associated GHG emissions go down by 42.1\% and 21.8\%, respectively. Interestingly, when we assumed the recall recognition stage was right after the defects occur, the largest effects of improving performance of the proposed platform were 48.3\% in import (IM) node of the port level. These results will provide a needed solution for cold chain management at the government level and affirms the essential role of the port/airport in the cold chain.

TI  - Seasonal and diurnal variations of greenhouse gas emissions from a saline mangrove constructed wetland by using an in situ continuous GHG monitoring system
AB  - Wetland systems play important roles in the issues of global warming. That is because wetlands can not only intake carbon and nitrogen in the plants and sediments, but could also release carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) to the atmosphere during the microbial decomposition processes in the water. In the past, greenhouse gases (GHGs) were measured mostly by using the manual sampling technique; however, it is difficult to measure the diurnal variation of greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, a floating chamber used to collect GHGs, which were then in-site monitored with a continuous GHG analyzer, through a Teflon tube connected to the top of the chamber was designed. The data for seasonal and diurnal variations of GHGs, emission fluxes of GHGs, and equivalent carbon dioxide emissions (CO2-e) were measured to explore the extent of a saline mangrove constructed wetland contributing to global warming. In addition, the correlation and regression analysis among greenhouse gas emissions, water quality, and other environmental factors were analyzed statistically. The results of continuous monitoring of GHGs showed that the concentrations of CO2 emitted from a saline mangrove constructed wetland ranged from 383.5 Â± 25.9 to 476.8 Â± 24.2Â ppm. The diurnal variation of GHG concentrations was significant, which showed that the GHG concentrations in the daytime were generally lower than those at nighttime. The emissions of methane (CH4) from the wetland were monitored in a range between 3.7 Â± 1.4 and 28.6 Â± 7.6Â ppm, while the concentrations of nitrous oxide (N2O) emitted from the wetlands ranged from 3.1 Â± 2.6 to 0.9 Â± 0.6Â ppm. Hence, the diurnal variations of CH4 and N2O concentrations showed higher values in the daytime than those at nighttime. The correlation analytical results among GHG emissions, water quality, and other environmental factors presented that the emission fluxes of CO2 and BOD5 were positively correlated, but a negative correlation was shown for global solar radiation (GSR). Moreover, the concentrations of CH4 and N2O had moderately positive correlation with both air temperature and water temperature. Â© 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Accelerating ocean-based renewable energy educational opportunities to achieve a clean energy future
AB  - The United Nations has named 2021-2030 the Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development with goals to 'strengthen the international cooperation needed to develop the scientific research and innovative technologies that can connect ocean science with the needs of society' (IOC 2019 The science we need for the ocean we want: The United Nations decade of ocean science for sustainable development (2021-2030) (Paris) p 24). Important actions that have been identified in support of sustainable development goals include capacity-building, training, and education. This includes educational opportunities for ocean-based renewable energy development in support of a healthy planet and ocean. Offshore wind is experiencing rapid development globally and, while the U.S. offshore wind market is still nascent, it is on the brink of exponential growth based on large cost reductions driven largely by European development and technology advances. Growth is also expected in wave and tidal energy with significant opportunities identified for various distributed markets through the Powering the Blue Economyâ„¢ initiative, with longer-term implications for expansion at the utility scale (LiVecchi et al 2019 Powering the blue economy; exploring opportunities for marine renewable energy in maritime markets p 207). In order to expedite progress and maximize benefits to the national, state, and local economies, these development actions will require a broad, diverse, and appropriately trained workforce. The ocean-based renewable energy workforce needs engineers and scientists to develop cost-effective technologies, as well as trade and maritime workers to eventually deploy the technologies at scale. In the United States, educational institutions, state governments, and private developers are taking action to understand job skills and capability requirements and to develop educational and training programs to meet offshore workforce needs; most are focused on offshore wind power, with gaining interest in marine energy. This article explores the workforce requirements of the growing ocean-based renewable energy industry and the current state of education and training programs to meet those requirements in order to identify gaps and make recommendations for further workforce development activities and initiatives. An international view needs to be adopted that incorporates the education and skill needs of early-stage marine energy technologies and evolving offshore wind technologies together with more market-ready offshore renewable energy markets. By accelerating educational development opportunities in ocean-based renewable energy, these growing blue economy markets can deliver significant economic and social benefits.

TI  - Innovative alternatives for repowering offshore wind farms
AB  - To deliver a climate neutral Europe by 2050 there is an unprecedented urgency to decarbonise Europe's electricity supply. The offshore wind industry is gearing up to this challenge with an increase in the rate at which high generating capacity offshore wind farms (OWFs) are deployed. Innovative repowering integrates early decommissioning and repowering of OWFs by using future large wind turbines (WTs, e.g. 20 MW WT). First-of-its-kind case studies have been presented to quantify the increased power generation capacity and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of repowering two OWFs with fixed and floating foundations. The repowering alternatives have been compared with the base case scenario (which involves decommissioning after the design life of 20 years) and the lifetime extension scenario (decommissioning in 25th year). The case studies show that a significant increase in energy output could be coupled with a reduction in the LCOE using the same OWF sites. The capacities of the OWF with fixed and floating foundations have been increased by 2.5 times (317 MW to 800 MW) and 2 times (400 MW to 800 MW) by repowering, respectively. Compared with developing an OWF on a new site, repowering has the potential to significantly accelerate the current installation capacity. Repowering has the potential to provide a competitive alternative to the lifetime extension of OWFs. Furthermore, the OWF with floating foundations has greater LCOE reductions compared with the OWFs with fixed foundations. This study has also provided evidence that enabling technologies and collaboration with other sectors would reduce the environmental impacts and costs of decommissioning of OWFs. This paper has suggested a way forward for research and development to overcome both technological and non-technological barriers to unlock the potential benefits of innovative alternatives of repowering OWFs.

TI  - Research on the Field-Modulated Tubular Linear Generator with Quasi-Halbach Magnetization for Ocean Wave Energy Conversion
AB  - A field-modulated tubular linear generator (FMTLG) with quasi-Halbach magnetization is proposed for ocean wave energy conversion. The FMTLG, which is equipped with field-modulated technology and quasi-Halbach arrays, can overcome the disadvantages of heavy weight and inefficiency caused by low-speed ocean waves to some extent. To design and optimize the FMTLG in a short time, the open-circuit magnetic field distribution is established with an analytical method. Results of a finite-element method show that the back EMF of the FMTLG is 43% higher than that of a tubular linear permanent magnet generator (TLPMG) with quasi-Halbach magnetization. A novel assistant tooth of the FMTLG makes the cogging force eight times smaller than that generated by the TLPMG. Finally, a prototype is manufactured to verify the simulation results by experiments. Â© 2018 IEEE.

Hence, deleterious effects of OA on fisheries and aquaculture are likely to have significant economic and social consequences, with regard to both economic losses and the need to identify appropriate adaptation strategies. Such regional assessments of the possible socio-economic impacts of OA on seafood are also relevant to the formulation of governmental policy, in relation to addressing the full social costs of carbon emissions and potentially strengthening the economic arguments for the mitigation of carbon emissions. Here we give a summary report on the status of following sets of data required to evaluate the likely scales of future economic losses to Mediterranean fisheries and aquaculture, a) direct and indirect effects of reduced pH Mediterranean species of socio-economic significance, b) effects of different global atmospheric carbon emission rates on future acidity of Mediterranean seawater, and c) the economic values of shellfish from both wild fisheries and aquaculture industries. The areas of uncertainty that warrant further investigation are also identified.

TI  - Assessment of Blue Carbon Stock of Coringa Mangroves: Climate Change Perspective
AB  - Blue carbon' has recently seized the attention of the scientific communities as they are believed to provide the benefits of climate change mitigation given its high potential to store carbon under unfavourable conditions. Keeping in mind the importance of the carbon storage capacity of mangroves, the present study has been carried out to determine the sedimentary organic carbon stock in Coringa mangroves. The value of total organic carbon (TOC) ranges from 0.63 to 2.76\% with a mean value of 1.30 +/- 4.3\%. The value of total nitrogen (TN) varies from 0.04 to 0.19\% with an average value of 0.08 +/- 0.03\%. Dry Bulk Density (DBD) ranges from 0.63 to 2.58 gm cm(-3) with a mean value of 1.33 +/- 0.19 gm cm(-3). The mean value of sedimentary carbon stock (SCS) in Coringa mangrove is 158 +/- 32.60 Mg C ha(-1). This amounts to the below-ground sedimentary carbon stock being 1.86 Tg C and represents the equivalent CO2 emission of 579.9 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1). The TOC, TN, DBD, and SCS show significant spatial variation among the different sites. The maximum carbon stock is found in densely vegetated Coringa mangroves, followed by moderately vegetated Gaderu mangroves and the least is found in the degraded forest of Matlapalem mangroves. Grain size parameters signify that there is no definite relationship between the organic carbon content and the abundance of finer sediments fractions in the Coringa mangrove. The higher carbon stock in Coringa mangroves reveals their importance in storing carbon and hence could have relevance on a national scale too and play an important role in climate change mitigation

TI  - Effects of wave excitation force prediction deviations on the discrete control performance of an oscillating wave energy converter
AB  - Oscillating-body converters are widely used in offshore engineering, to capture wave energies. In such a case, discrete control including both latching and declutching controls is adopted to improve the power capture performance of oscillating wave energy converters (WECs). A reliable prediction of wave excitation forces on the WEC is essential for the discrete control strategy. In this study, a time domain model is developed to calculate the hydrodynamic responses of a hemispherical oscillating WEC with discrete control in regular waves. A state space model is used to deal with the convolution term in the time domain equation, taking into account the memory effects of wave surface. Based on the developed numerical model, the effects of prediction deviations, such as the amplitude and phase of wave excitation force, have been studied. It is observed that the amplitude prediction deviation exhibits very few effects on the control performance. However, the phase prediction deviation performances significantly influence on the control performance. In some conditions, the phase prediction deviation will reduce the efficiency of the discrete control.

TI  - Pile driving of open-ended steel piles in offshore wind industry - Comparison of prognosis and measurements [Schlagrammung von StahlrohrpfÃ¤hlen fÃ¼r die Offshore-Windindustrie: GegenÃ¼berstellung von Prognose und Messung]
AB  - Pile driving of open-ended steel piles in offshore wind industry â€“ comparison of prognosis and measurements. Today popular foundation methods of offshore wind turbines (Jackets, Tripods or Monopiles) are mainly realised with steel pipe piles. Against the background of cost effectiveness, the selection of a driving system as well as design fatigue calculations it is of importance to run driveability analysis prior to the installation process. Results and criteria for that are amongst others (e.g. propagation of underwater sound, not discussed here) blow count and duration of a driving process as well as the soil resistance at the moment of driving (with or without driving stops) being the so-called static resistance to driving (SRD) and compressive and tensile stresses within the pile. At real pile driving usually dynamic pile tests are performed in order to record real blow counts und stresses in the pile and furthermore, to verify pile capacity. In the present paper theoretical driveability analyses and thus SRD models will be compared with results of dynamic pile tests in certain offshore wind farms in the North and Baltic Seas in order to check their applicability based on sand or chalk dominated soils.

TI  - A novel approach to evaluate potential risk of organic enrichment in marine aquaculture farms: a case study in Sanggou Bay
AB  - A novel approach was proposed to evaluate the potential risk of organic enrichment in marine aquaculture farms without obvious environmental degradation. The approach was based on historical environmental records preserved in sediment cores, and potential risk of organic enrichment can be effectively evaluated by comparing burial fluxes of marine organic carbon (OCM) during times before and after large-scale aquaculture. A case study was conducted in Sanggou Bay. The change trends on burial fluxes of organic carbon in sediment over the past 150 years were rebuilt. OCM burial fluxes have greatly increased since the beginning of large-scale aquaculture in 1980s, reaching 16.0 similar to 16.5 times higher than that before large-scale aquaculture. The results indicate that aquaculture activities have resulted in obvious accumulation of aquacultural organic matters, although sedimental environment has not degraded seriously. Besides, if the OCM burial fluxes further increase to 3.5 similar to 7.0 times higher than that in present, sedimental environment may degrade obviously. Therefore, potential risks of organic enrichment still exist with aquaculture development in Sanggou Bay.

TI  - MECHANICS AND MATERIALS IN THE DESIGN OF SYMBIOTIC OFFSHORE ENERGY HARVESTING SYSTEMS
AB  - A single type of energy harvesting device may be too expensive to deploy, but if it can operate symbiotically (Slocum, 2014) with another, the combined cost of energy might be acceptable. As an example, consider offshore wind turbines, which hope to use their greater capacity factors to compete with land-based turbines; however the structures can become prohibitively expensive if they must be placed further offshore to avoid opposition from shoreline residents. To reduce overall costs of energy, this paper will explore adding wave energy and uranium-from-seawater harvesting devices to offshore wind turbine structures.

TI  - Marine current energy extraction through buffeting
AB  - The research is an experimental study on the feasibility of marine current energy extraction through the phenomenon of buffeting. This phenomenon is a type of flow-induced oscillation of an elastic structure that is caused by the unsteadiness of the incoming flow. In order to prove the concept, a preliminary unit turbine model is designed working based on the buffeting phenomenon. The turbine model is an elastic structure, consisting of a rectangular flat plate located in a current flume. The elasticity is provided by attachment of four linear springs with equal rates (k) at the edges of the flat plate, to give an equivalent torsion spring rate. The unsteadiness is due to the wake of a bluff body located for this purpose in the upstream of the flat plate. The von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n street in the wake formed behind the bluff body induces oscillating moments in the flat plate which makes it to yaw with small angles of attack. The results demonstrate that one such system has the ability to extract hydrokinetic energy with efficiencies of up to 60%. The model tests results then are used to estimate the performance of the array of turbines, through the similarity analysis. Finally, a rough estimate of the manufacturing, installation and operation cost of the buffeting turbine subsea farm is presented. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Subsea blowout source control technologies utilized at the Macondo accident and developments in the Post-Macondo era
AB  - The publication generally and briefly describes what circumstances governed the petroleum industry and the connected regulatory organizations before the Macondo blowout. The paper shortly describes utilized classic containment and control efforts such as actuation attempts of the BOP, top kill with junk shot, relief wells. The publication's main focus is to describe and graphically present in detail the Cofferdam, the Riser Insertion Tube Tool, Top Hat, Capping Stack and choke and kill line collection method which were utilized to seal off the flow of hydrocarbons at the Macondo blowout. An extended literature review has been completed to fully cover and understand the technologies which were utilized and newly developed in the efforts to stop the outflow and abrogate the accident. The assessment of critical properties, problems are also presented next to the description of the specific source control technology. The blowout has triggered efforts never seen before both in short- and long-term not only from the side of affected regulatory and company side but industry wide. Short-term, the main effort was to contain the blowout as soon as possible, long-term it triggered strong determination from companies, and connected businesses to create proper contingency planning, containment technologies and strategies also through newly established consortiums. The non-profit oriented consortiums, containment systems and established HSE regulations need to be maintained properly even in a low oil price environment, so deeper understanding, recurrent inspection of the development ways of containment technologies in offshore environment can be crucial for sustaining the high HSE standards. The paper also aims to summarize knowledge to be able to make proper decisions in case of deepwater projects. Copyright 2016, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - SHIP PROPULSIVE PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT AND GHG EMISSIONS REQUIREMENTS
AB  - Maritime transport represents a considerable source of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions, with negative impact on environment and climate change. As a technical measure to quantify and reduce CO2 emissions from ships, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has introduced Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI). After a brief overview of the issues related to shipping GHG emissions, the paper presents an assessment of propulsion performances for different type of merchant ships, taking into considerations EEDI requirements. Alternative combinations between diesel engines and optimal efficiency propellers have been analysed. For every ship type, size and speed, different diesel engines have been selected and propellers have been redesigned to absorb delivered power and to give maximum efficiency at the required speed. For every study case, an attained EEDI has been computed and compared with required IMO EEDI. The impact of two parameters from EEDI formula: power and speed has been assessed to find solutions for EEDI reduction.

TI  - Organic chemistry insights for the exceptional soil carbon storage of the seagrass Posidonia australis
AB  - The high organic carbon (OC) stores in seagrass meadows have led to their recognition as significant Blue Carbon sinks, though the diagenetic conditions that enable OC retention in seagrass soils remain poorly understood. In this study, seagrass soils were sampled from a Posidonia australis meadow in Oyster Harbour (Albany; southwestern Australia) to investigate the preservation of sedimentary OC. We analysed soil characteristics (colour, grain size and redox potential), radiocarbon age, and characterised the soil organic matter (OM) using solid state CP/MAS C-13 NMR spectroscopy to examine the preservation of OM down the soil profile. There was minimal change in organic composition over 1,700 years of accumulation, indicating long-term OM preservation. Primarily, this preservation appears to be driven by the recalcitrance of seagrass detritus buried in anoxic soils. The majority (70-83\%) of total sedimentary OM comprised components directly attributable to seagrass origins (lignin, carbohydrate and black carbon-like matter), while the remainder consisted mostly of protein, some of which may have been present in seagrass biomass, along with likely contributions from algae and microbes. Although black carbon originates from organic matter combustion, here we provide evidence that the C-13 NMR signal identified as black carbon-like matter in our soils is possibly associated with seagrass-derived organic matter consisting of degraded lignin products or other non-pyrogenic aromatics. The increase in the relative abundance of this black carbon-like matter with aging suggests its selective preservation. The relative abundances of carbohydrates significantly decreased with age down core (i.e. they appeared to be selectively decomposed), while lignin and protein did not show any quantitative changes in relative abundance (non-selective preservation). These findings demonstrate the exceptional preservation of P. australis derived OC, which contributes to our understanding of the higher OC storage capacity of Posidonia compared to other seagrass species.

TI  - A real options optimization model to meet availability requirements for offshore wind turbines
AB  - This paper provides an optimization model based on Real Options (RO) and stochastic dynamic programming for the availability maximization of an offshore wind farm with prognostic capabilities. Alternative energy sources such as offshore wind turbines are promising technologies, but they are capital intensive projects, and the economics of the project depend heavily on the wind resources, and the availability of the turbines. Prognostics and health management (PHM) is an enabling technology that potentially allows for reduced life cycle cost through a transition from cycle or time based to demand-based maintenance, performance based logistics, and condition-based maintenance. This is especially important for offshore wind farms that require non-traditional resources for maintenance, and are often located in sites that are not always accessible. The proposed model uses information from the PHM system in order to allocate appropriate investments in maintenance while maintaining a specified availability requirement. The RO theory provides promising means to address the economic aspects of PHM after prognostic indication, and assessing the cost required for meeting availability requirements.

TI  - Method for calculating the horizontal bearing capacity of segmentally-tapered bucket foundation of offshore wind turbines
AB  - Because large construction ships cannot enter the shallow sea, traditional configuration foundations, such as gravity-type foundation and pile foundation, are not suited for offshore wind power project in shallow seas. Therefore, a new type of foundation-segmentally-tapered bucket foundation is proposed. Based on the limit equilibrium method, a systematic method is proposed to calculate the horizontal bearing capacity of the segmentally-tapered bucket foundation. The influences of obliquity of wall, foundation height, top diameter of bucket and soil parameters on the horizontal bearing capacity of the segmentally-tapered bucket foundation are analyzed. It is found that the horizontal bearing capacity increases with the increase of the wall obliquity, soil resistance, top diameter of bucket and foundation height, while decreases with the increase of the depth of seabed. Based on the concept of volume compression ratio, the bucket foundation with inclined upper section wall and vertical lower section wall is recommended and demonstrated. An accurate method is proposed to determine the proportional coefficient of soil resistance. The results are helpful in the optimization design of traditional bucket foundation.

TI  - Tomorrow's energy: Wave and tidal
AB  - Currently, the need has never been greater for technologies that capture marine energy for conversion into a clean, dependable, and sustainable source of power. The Carbon Trust, set up by the UK government to accelerate the move towards a low carbon economy, estimates that a fifth of Britain's electricity needs could come from marine sources. Wave power devices absorb energy from waves for generators to convert into electricity. Tidal stream devices act like submerged wind generators, capturing kinetic energy from fast-flowing currents. Earlier in 2008, Irish company Open Hydro became the first to connect a tidal turbine to the UK's energy grid. In addition to developing efficient and dependable technologies, innovative energy storage systems close to the point of generation are also needed.

TI  - Integrated subsea production system: An overview on energy distribution and remote control
AB  - In 2012, Brasil had a proved reserve of 15.3 billions of BOE (barrel of oil equivalent). The offshore reserve corresponds to more 94% of this amount. Petrobras, the Brasilian E&P company, leads the offshore production in ultra-deep water (deeper than 1500 m of water depth) worldwide. The current offshore production in ultra-deep waters deploys a Floating Production Unit (FPU), and some subsea equipments, such as, wet Christmas trees, manifolds, separation & booster systems, risers and pipelines. However, on board of the FPU, there are several other systems, namely, power generators, separators, gas treatment system, water treatment system, artificial lift system, injection system, etc. A future paradigm shift in the offshore petroleum production shall be the installation of all necessary systems on the sea floor. This article addresses to two challenges that raise with this new integrated operations with subsea oilfield production: the 'remote operation and monitoring', and the 'power generation and distribution'. Remote operation and monitoring come from the need to transfer the process operators to shore and optimize the number of operators, to improve the processes availability by reducing the operator response time to a specific task, to provide continuous and predictive monitoring of vital processes, among other factors. Within the context of integrated operations, a remote operating center provides a broad and integrated overview of several processes in the asset, by using modern supervisory software (3D and 4D), database, remote sensoring, among others technologies. Part of this article also provides a comparative discussion between some technologies used in the implementation of remote operation and monitoring. Due to the substantial amount of electrical power required by subsea process units and their relatively long life cycle, typical aspects related to power generation and distribution have been changing. Alternatives, which were not cost effective before, are considered as new trends in the development of new process units due to political aspects and advances in the technology involved. Subsea high-voltage power distribution systems have become an alternative to supply the total load of subsea process units. According to this approach, electrical power distribution is located near the load center, as on shore installations. Normally, such installations are supplied from shore through long power umbilicals, as the supply of individual loads is not economically interesting. The advances in the use of renewable sources have also promoted new alternatives in power generation. These approaches become more interesting due to the possibility of installing large power generation plants using renewable sources on shallow water and transmitting the power to a set of subsea process units. Thus, new alternatives arise, such as the possibility of power transmission in high voltage direct current systems (HVDC), avoiding common problems faced in power transfer capacity using high voltage alternate current systems (HVAC), as large amount of reactive power needed to compensate cable's capacitance. This paper discusses these issues aroused due to power supply of subsea process units. Â© 2014 IEEE.

AB  - For ultra-high-power offshore wind turbines of 5 MW or above, the current medium and low-voltage technology solutions make generators and converters withstand large currents, which causes the low efficiency of wind power systems. A structure of a high-voltage permanent magnet multi-phase generator with reactive power feed windings is briefly described. This new structure can directly realize high-voltage direct current (HVDC) by using series unipolar converters with simple topology. Besides, the injection of reactive power into the generator with reactive feed windings can realize the decoupling control of the generator excitation and torque. In addition, the new technical solution can also be used to inhibition the peak short-circuit current when the HVDC transmission line is short-circuit. The paper focuses on the steady state characteristics of the generator. Firstly, the mathematical model of the stator multi-winding synchronous generator is deduced, and then the steady-state characteristics of the generator in the new technical scheme are analyzed by numerical calculation method using related parameters of a 6.7 MVA wind turbine.

TI  - Ice loading on Danish wind turbines. Part 1: Dynamic model tests
AB  - An extensive model test program has been carried out to investigate the key ice load issues on offshore wind turbines in Danish waters. Tests were performed using a compliant structure that had scaled structural characteristics. The test program investigated seven configurations of model structures and dynamic characteristics. Both first- and second-mode vibration issues were investigated. Forty-one ice sheets were used giving information on 144 different experimental set-ups. The parameters that were changed in the tests included the ice velocity, ice thickness, shape of the structure, water level on the structure, structure stiffness and the natural frequency of the structure. Measurements were made of forces, accelerations and displacement of the model during the interaction with ice. Four different ice failure modes were identified-flexure, crushing, mixed mode, and lock-in. The results gave information on the anticipated ice loads and the likelihood of ice-induced vibrations for both the first-mode and second-mode vibration frequencies. They also provided guidance on the optimum angle and cone-size for a protective ice collar for the wind turbines. This paper provides the results of the model tests. A companion paper [Cold Reg. Sci. Technol., (2004)], provides information on the application of the results to the design of an offshore wind turbine farm. Â© 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Emerging atmospheric carbon dioxide removal and utilisation techniques
AB  - The increasing carbon emissions from fossil fuel combustion and land use change will lead to disastrous global warming in the near future, so it is widely recognised as one of the most challenges facing human societies. In this paper, we will assess the atmospheric carbon dioxide removal and recycling utilisation which can turn anthropogenic carbon emissions from carbon pollution into valuable resource and then satisfy the needs of sustainable development goals (SDGs). The direct removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide is mainly through direct air capture, sustainable biochar, desert geoengineering, and ocean fertilisation. Captured atmospheric carbon dioxide can further be utilised in the synthesis of various fuels or enhance of traditional energy production. This novel approach can bring the atmospheric carbon dioxide back to the energy cycle, converse fossil energy into carbon-neutral energy, and then achieve the recycle of carbon dioxide resource.

TI  - Small-Scale Renewable Energy Converters for Battery Charging
AB  - This paper presents two wave energy concepts for small-scale electricity generation. In the presented case, these concepts are installed on the buoy of a heaving, point-absorbing wave energy converter (WEC) for large scale electricity production. In the studied WEC, developed by Uppsala University, small-scale electricity generation in the buoy is needed to power a tidal compensating system designed to increase the performance of the WEC in areas with high tides. The two considered and modeled concepts are an oscillating water column (OWC) and a heaving point absorber. The results indicate that the OWC is too small for the task and does not produce enough energy. On the other hand, the results show that a hybrid system composed of a small heaving point absorber combined with a solar energy system would be able to provide a requested minimum power of around 37.7W on average year around. The WEC and solar panel complement each other, as the WEC produces enough energy by itself during wintertime (but not in the summer), while the solar panel produces enough energy in the summer (but not in the winter).

TI  - The life-cycle energy and environmental emissions of a typical offshore wind farm in China
AB  - China's vast untapped offshore wind energy and the concentration of electricity consumers in coastal regions make offshore wind power a promising solution to the country's cleaner power transition. However, the potential energy and environmental emissions of offshore wind farms have not been thoroughly investigated. Thus, this study employed a process-based life cycle inventory (LCI) model to calculate the life-cycle energy and emissions of offshore wind power in China based on the country's first offshore wind energy project. Results showed that the life-cycle energy of the studied wind farm was 2.28E+09 MJ or 0.39 MJ/kwh, with emission intensities of 25.5 g CO2-eq/kWh for GHG, 0.02 g/kWh for PM2.5, 0.06 g/kWh for SO2 and 0.09 g/kWh for NOx. The life-cycle footprints are dominated by the manufacture of wind turbines and foundation materials production. Compared to onshore wind farms, offshore wind power plants usually have greater life-cycle electricity yields, but their levelized energy and environmental footprints are less favorable. The green manufacturing of China's steel sector, and scientific operation and maintenance programs of wind facilities contribute to greening offshore wind power. Results of this study facilitate robust policy making of government authorities and contribute to the green deployment of offshore wind technologies in China. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The project is projected to cost about $600 million, of which Ormats share will be about $200 million. The Sarulla project is expected to be built over the next 5 yr in three phases of 110-120 Mw each.

TI  - Modelling of a wave-to-wire system for a wave farm and its response analysis against power quality and grid codes
AB  - A single wave energy converter (WEC) produces a low and fluctuating power, and the use of a permanent magnet linear generator (PMLG) as an electric power take-off unit can make the situation worse because the power produced from a PMLG varies with each incident wave. The use of a short-term energy storage unit as an energy buffer will become necessary to mitigate the fluctuating power. However, the addition of the energy storage system will further increase the cost of the WEC. This paper proposes a modelling strategy for the wave-to-wire system of WEC arrays, consisting of Archimedes wave swings coupled with PMLGs, to analyze its power output quality and grid compliance without the integration of any energy storage system. The measured hydrodynamics of ocean waves are used for the analysis of the system. The developed model for the wave-to-wire system is tested under various scenarios for its power output quality while maintaining grid code compliance. The flicker level at the point of common coupling for the wave farm is evaluated for grids of varying strength. The simulation results show that the proposed configuration of the wave-to-wire system can be integrated with the grids of sufficient strength, without the need for expensive energy storage units, while complying with the grid code in the respective countries, such as Ireland, UK and Nordic countries. The main contributions of this paper are (i) a new modelling strategy to analyze a wave-to-wire system, (ii) simulation studies to analyze the power quality and grid code compliance of a wave-to-wire system, (iii) recommendations for the required grid strength to integrate wave farms to the grid.

TI  - Integrated polygeneration system for coastal areas
AB  - Polygeneration is a sustainable energy concept, which could deliver multiple energy vectors (power, heat and cooling) and other useful products (desalinated water, hydrogen, etc.) by possible integration of suitable technologies. In this study, a polygeneration system for coastal area applications is driven by a hybrid solar/bio-oil boiler to produce the energy intensive products of cooling, power, desalinated water and hot air for drying. Solar thermal is the primary energy source to drive the polygeneration system, whereas the bio-oil boiler is the auxiliary source to drive it at non-sunshine hours. The performance characteristics of the hybrid system is investigated to identify the effects of various key parameters such as temperatures of heat source, sink and evaporator along with expander Built in Volume ratio. The obtained results at a typical operating condition show that the parabolic trough collector aperture area is 130 m(2), the system produces net power output of 47 kW, desalinated water of 1.205 m(3)/h, 92 kW of hot air for drying and 141 kW of cooling. The overall energy and exergy efficiencies of the proposed system are found to be 22\% and 87\%, respectively.

TI  - A novel entrainment wind farm flow model for power prediction
AB  - The wind farm flow (WFF) models, which are enabled to predict the power output of downstream, located turbines within a wind farm. A WFF model consists of two main model components: a single wake model and a superposition model. Two WFF models, the Root Sum Square (RSS) superposition model incorporated into the single wake models (e.g. Bastankah and PortÃ©-Agel wake (BPA) model and Jensen wake model), have been extensively applied in engineering. But the WFF models above-mentioned tend to overestimate the power deficit of the whole wind farm. Hence, a novel entrainment wind farm flow (NEWFF) model is proposed in this paper, which is a combination of a modified linear entrainment wake (MLEW) model and the RSS superposition model. Different from the previous linear entrainment wake (LEW) model, the MLEW model developed in this paper considers the impacts of terrain roughness variables on the wake distribution of downstream wind turbines. The MLEW model significantly improves the accuracy of the wake simulation over the advanced BPAW model and JW model, as well as the LEW model, as shown in two cases from the TNO wind tunnel. Finally, several cases of Horns Rev offshore wind farm and Lillgrund offshore wind farm are utilized to validate the NEWFF model. Compared with the latest advanced Zong and Agel superposition wake (ZASW) model and BPA wind farm flow (BPAWFF) model, it has been demonstrated that the prediction results obtained with the NEWFF model exhibit the best agreements with measured power data under full and partial wake conditions.

AB  - This work focuses on the initial performance assessment of an array of coaxial-duct (CD) oscillating-water-columns (owc's) with potential to be used as multipurpose platform for the creation of value in a diverse range of offshore economic activities. The coaxial-duct owc (CD-owc) is an axisymmetric oscillating water -column wave energy converter that has been studied for both small-size and large-size applications. This work focuses on buoys of 12 meter diameter distributed in an array of five devices, rigidly attached to each other, to form a cluster of owc's. The objective of the study is to assess the performance of the array with this configuration and estimate the effect of parameters such as distance between devices, various modes of movements, and other constraints on the overall power output of the array. Results of different cases are compared to the performance of an isolated device to determine the interference effect of other devices.

TI  - An abrupt CO2-mediated decrease in pH affects growth rates, cellular features and the interspecific interaction of Scenedesmus (Acutodesmus) obliquus and Cryptomonas pyrenoidifera
AB  - The technologies of anthropogenic CO2 mitigation, such as carbon capture and sequestration, may pose an environmental threat to aquatic systems. In a scenario of CO2 leakage from a carbon capture and sequestration process, very low-pH values might be reached and could remain over time. The main objective of this study was to detect how an abrupt lowermg of pH would affect the microalgae Scenedesmus (Acutodesmus) obliquus and Cryptomonas pyrenoidifera at physiological, morphological and population levels, and also see how these effects could lead to ecological consequences. Monospecific and mixed culture experiments were run according to this purpose over 14 days and at a pH of 6.5, controlled by CO2 injection. An increased CO2 concentration significantly enhanced the growth rate of both species and especially affected the cell size of C. pyrenoidifera in the monoculture. The total biovolume of C. pyrenoidifera was higher than the total biovolume of S. obliquus in the control treatment, although neither of the two species were dominant in the culture experiments. Granularity responded in different ways for the species studied, being statistically different within subjects in monospecific and mixed culture experiments. Only chlorophyll and granularity have been significantly correlated in the low pH of C. pyrenoidifera monoculture. Due to its ecological relevance, the decreased colony formation ability of S. obliquus under a high CO2 concentration is highlighted.

TI  - SEA-KEEPING ANALYSIS OF AN OFFSHORE WIND FARM INSTALLATION VESSEL DURING THE JACK-UP PROCESS
AB  - Offshore wind farms are not planned in sheltered and shallow waters any longer. Especially in the North Sea there exist many approved offshore wind farm projects at water depth between 30 and 50 meters. In particular the installation process of these projects is strongly influenced by weather conditions and the sea-keeping capabilities of the installation vessels. For reliable planning of the entire project, not only the weather statistics, but also the vessel's sea-keeping capabilities need to be known accurately. For this purpose different kinds of sea-keeping analyses can be conducted. In this paper a sea-keeping analysis is presented, where the focus is upon the jack-up process. For the numerical computation the sea-keeping code E4ROLLS is applied. The results of this sea-keeping analysis are operational limitations for the jack-up process, caused by two different criteria derived from jack-up classification requirements.

The model is derived from the first principles, and therefore, can be manipulated by its real physical parameters while maintaining accuracy across the highly nonlinear operating range of floating wind turbine systems (WTSs). Forces and torques generated by wind and wave disturbances are derived for a baseline 5-MW wind turbine on a semisubmersible platform. The proposed model is validated against advanced simulation software FAST, and shown to be accurate at predicting major dynamics of the floating WTS.

TI  - Assessing the need for flexibility technologies in decarbonized power systems: A new model applied to Central Europe
AB  - The increasing use of renewable energy leads to a higher share of intermittent and volatile electricity generation. In this paper, we develop FLEXIES, a new open-source power system optimization model to determine the cost-efficient deployment of renewable electricity generation technologies and flexibility technologies. We apply FLEXIES in a case study of power systems in Central Europe (Switzerland, Austria, France, Germany, and Italy) in 2030, 2040, and 2050. The case study indicates that low-carbon electricity generation, batteries, and power-to-gas, consisting of multiple gas storages, are cost-efficient in 2050 â€“ rather than burning natural gas in gas turbines. Such decarbonized power systems could be cost-efficient earlier assuming sufficiently high carbon prices. Furthermore, we find that onshore wind is prioritized over highly volatile solar generation due to a lower need for electricity storage. Interconnections enable higher shares of uniform generation technologies (onâ€“ and offshore wind, nuclear, biomass-waste) and reduce the need for solar and storage. Hence, compared to a case in which countries are isolated, interconnections reduce total electricity generation by up to 8.2%, system costs by up to 16.3%, and carbon equivalent emissions by up to 9.0%. Finally, we observe that decarbonized power systems entail a cost shift from the operational to the investment phase and total normalized costs could be higher than power market prices. Thus, new mechanisms may be needed to incentivize decarbonized power systems. Â© 2020 The Author(s)

TI  - Numerical studies on hydrodynamics of a floating oscillating water column
AB  - The oscillating water column (OWC) is one of the more successful wave energy converters so far due to its mechanical and structural simplicity; there are no components for power take-off in seawater. Though there are some successful practical developments in bottom-fixed OWCs, floating OWCs are still in different stages of development. A specific oscillating water column, the OE Buoy (i.e. backward-bent duct device, 'B2D2'), developed by OceanEnergy (Ireland), has recently attracted much attention. A 1:2.5 scale device has finished a sea-trial in Galway Bay (Ireland) for a period over two years during which period the device has gone through a severe storm. Thus its survivability has been confirmed to some extent. In this research, numerical simulations to the floating wave energy device are performed using a boundary element method code WAMIT. To consider the motions of the internal water in the column for energy extraction, a "numerical lid" is placed on the free surface in the column. In WAMIT, the motions of the "numerical lid" can be calculated by introducing relevant generalized modes to the conventional 6-DOF motions of the floating structure. For wave energy extraction, the "piston effect" of the internal water must be considered. To include the effect of the mooring system to the motions of floating structure, the mooring forces have been linearised, and their equivalent spring coefficients have been input to WAMIT for analysis of the moored floating structure. For the numerical simulation, the first case is to tune the damping coefficients based on wave tank results since in WAMIT, only hydrodynamic damping is included in calculation. In reality, larger damping may be needed to limit the large responses in heave of floating structure and the motion of the internal water surface. The tuned damping coefficients are then applied to the modified OWCs of different duct length, in which it is hoping that the corresponding responses of the internal free surface structure are used to assess the performance of the floating OWC. The aim of the research is to explore the relation between the OWC size and its performance so that it may provide a reference for optimizing the design of a floating OWC in the future.

TI  - Undersea pumped storage for load leveling
AB  - The demand for electrical energy varies substantially over a 24 hour period. The supply of energy must be exactly matched to these changing demands.. Taking generating facilities on and off line and operating them at less than optimum performance levels is uneconomical. Therefore, when it is feasible, pumped storage is used to achieve load leveling. Water is pumped uphill and stored in a reservoir during low demand periods and allowed to flow down through turbogenerators when demand is high. In Southern California there are no locations where demand, water supply and environmentally acceptable reservoir sites coexist. Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) is a potential candidate for electrical energy load leveling in the absence of conventional pumped storage capability. In CAES, air is mechanically pressurized using surplus electrical power into man-made subterranean caverns. It is released during peak demand periods and either powers a turbine directly. or is mixed with natural gas and the mixture burned in the turbine. None of the suitable sites identified for CAES exist in coastal areas within the United States: Offshore Compressed Air Energy Storage (OCAES) is a conceptual modification of CAES in which the very high ambient pressures at depth in the ocean serves to reduce the storage vessel structural requirements.. Air is pumped into the system, displacing the seawater, until the storage section is filled. This air is maintained at the water pressure appropriate to the depth. Air can be withdrawn from the storage vessel at a constant pressure until water starts to fill the outfall. There are several sites along the California coast that offer close proximity to deep water and existing access to grid transmission lines, transformers, switching and other infrastructure. The paper discusses a 230 MW OCAES system sited at Carlsbad as an example.

TI  - Sustainability and place: How emerging mega-trends of the 21st century will affect humans and nature at the landscape level
AB  - We discuss the sustainability of natural and human systems in the United States in relation to 21st century threats associated with energy scarcity, climate change, the loss of ecosystem services, the limitations of neoclassical economics, and human settlement patterns. Increasing scarcity and the decreasing return on investment for existing conventional energy reserves are expected to significantly reduce the amount of affordable energy for societal needs and demands. This will also make dealing with the predicted impacts of climate change more difficult and expensive. Climate change will threaten the present sustainability of natural environments, agriculture, and urban areas but these impacts will manifest themselves differentially across the landscape. The impacts of projected climate change will make living in arid regions of the southern Great Plains, the Southwest, and the southern half of California increasingly difficult. Accelerated sea-level rise and increased frequency of strong hurricanes will increase the vulnerability of natural and human systems along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts while making them less sustainable. Ecosystem services provided by natural environments form the basis for the human economy everywhere and are also at risk from climate change impacts and overuse. Decreasing energy availability, climate change, and continued degradation of ecosystem services are likely to make continued economic growth difficult if not impossible. The capacity of neoclassical economics to effectively deal with these growing threats is limited. The areas of the country most compromised by these 21st century trends are likely to be the southern Great Plains, Southwest, southern California, the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, and densely populated areas everywhere, but especially in the northeast, Midwest, and southern California.

TI  - Nitrogen self-recuperation expansion-based process for offshore coproduction of liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, and pentane plus
AB  - In the current scenario of energy challenges, natural gas (NG) and associated liquids such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) are considered to be clean energy sources compared with coal and oil. Liquefaction is one of the most feasible and safe approaches for transporting NG from the site of production to the site of consumption. However, NG processing to produce liquefied natural gas (LNG) and LPG is extremely costly in terms of both operating and capital expenses because it requires a tremendous amount of energy, particularly at offshore sites. We have developed a new liquefaction process that uses N-2 self-recuperation rather than external precooling with 80\% less energy consumption than that required by existing single N-2 expander processes. In this work, we evaluate the use of an innovative self-recuperative expander-based integrated process to produce LNG LPG pentane plus (condensate) at an offshore site in an energy-efficient manner with minimal capital expenditure. Thermodynamic and economic analyses were performed to evaluate the commercial feasibility of the proposed process. Furthermore, the environmental impact in terms of CO2 emissions was calculated. This study reveals that LNG LPG can be produced at a specific energy expense of 0.2362 kW with a payback period of 1.38 years.

TI  - Global CO2 storage potential of self-sealing marine sedimentary strata
AB  - One potential way to geologically sequester captured CO2 emissions is to inject them below the seafloor into marine sedimentary strata where pressures and temperatures would trap the CO2 through "self-sealing" gravitational and hydrate-formation mechanisms. Here we map out the worldwide distribution and thicknesses of such self-sealing strata using a comprehensive, global dataset of deep-sea sediment cores in combination with digital grids of ocean floor heat flow, bathymetry, and sediment thickness. Based on our mapping, we estimate that the total bulk sediment volume of self-sealing strata is 63 million cubic kilometers, 0.8-1.4 km3 (or âˆ¼1.3-2.7%) of which are sands with intrinsic permeability suitable for storing CO2. This is enough storage capacity to hold between 1,260-28,500 gigatonnes of CO2, or about 40-1,000 y of total global CO2 emissions. However, the storage capacity is unevenly distributed where it lies within the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) of the world's largest CO2 emitting economies. The United States and India respectively release 16% and 62% of their annual CO2 emissions (or 1 Bt/y and 800 Mt/y) within 500 km of self-sealing sands located in their EEZs, while only 6% of the annual emissions from China and the European Union (or 330 Mt/y and 250 Mt/y, respectively) occur within this distance.

TI  - Rapid Estimation of Carbon Dioxide Stored in CO2 EOR Operations for Screening Purposes
AB  - We describe the development, testing, and first application of a rapid method for estimating the CO2 storage potential associated with CO2 enhanced oil recovery in both secondary and tertiary modes. The new method builds on various published empirical models for predicting incremental oil recovery (and hence CO2storage) in solvent floods. It improves the representation of reservoir heterogeneity caused by de positional layering and fracturing. This is then combined with material balance to make site-specific estimates of theCO2 storage potential. We cross-checked predictions from the new method against historical field data for major onshore CO2floods with satisfactory results considering the very approximate nature of the estimation. We then applied the method to a selection of offshore oil reservoirs and found that, generally, the larger the remaining oil, which is a function of initial size and current recovery factor, the greater the CO2 storage potential. We also modelled the case of continued injection after ceasing oil production at, or after, CO2 break through and observed that, as expected, the amount of CO2 stored at breakthrough depends on how early this occurs, which is affected by reservoir heterogeneity, whereas continued injection is limited by the head room between current reservoir pressure and fracture pressure. The overall storage is the result of the interplay between these two mechanisms. In the studied fields/reservoirs, we demonstrated that large amounts ofCO2 can be stored in terms of absolute mass and that storage of these quantities would represent significant abatement of the emissions generated by burning the incremental oil. The new method can be used as a screening tool to identify and rank candidate oil fields for combinedCO2 enhanced oil recovery and storage in regional, national, or corporate portfolios.

TI  - Composite Repair in Wind Turbine Blades: An Overview
AB  - Renewable energy sources such as wind energy-together with energy-efficient technologies-are essential to meet global energy demands and address climate change. Fiber-reinforced polymer composites, with their superior structural properties (e.g., high stiffness-to-weight) that allow lightweight and robust designs, play a significant part in the design and manufacture of modern wind turbines, especially turbine blades, for demanding service conditions. However, with the current global growth in onshore/offshore wind farm installations (with total global capacity of similar to 282GW by the end of 2012) and trend in wind turbine design (similar to 7-8MW turbine capacity with similar to 70-80m blade length for offshore installations), one of the challenges that the wind energy industry faces with composite turbine blades is the aspect of structural maintenance and repair. Although wind turbines are typically designed for a service life of about 20 years, robust structural maintenance and repair procedures are essential to ensure the structural integrity of wind turbines and prevent catastrophic failures. Wind blades are damaged due to demanding mechanical loads (e.g., static and fatigue), environmental conditions (e.g., temperature and humidity) and also manufacturing defects. If material damage is not extensive, structural repair is the only viable option to restore strength since replacing the entire blade is not cost-effective, especially for larger blades. Composite repairs (e.g., external and scarf patches) can be used to restore damaged laminate/sandwich regions in wind blades. With composite materials in the spar (similar to 30-80mm thick glass/carbon fiber laminates) and aerodynamic shells (sandwich sections with thin glass fiber skins and thick foam/wood as core), it is important to have reliable and cost-effective structural repair procedures to restore damaged wind blades. However, compared to aerospace bonded repairs, structural repair procedures in wind blades are not as well developed and thus face several challenges. In this regard, the area of composite repair in wind blades is broadly reviewed to provide an overview as well as identify associated challenges.

TI  - Linking Plankton Size Spectra and Community Composition to Carbon Export and Its Efficiency
AB  - The magnitude and efficiency of particulate carbon export from the ocean surface depends not only on net primary production (NPP) but also on how carbon is consumed, respired, and repackaged by organisms. We contend that several of these processes can be captured by the size spectrum of the plankton community. However, most global models have relatively simple food-web structures that are unable to generate plankton size spectra. Moreover, the life-cycles of multicellular zooplankton are typically not resolved, restricting the ability of models to represent time-lags that are known to impact carbon export and its efficiency (pe-ratio). Here, we use a global mechanistic size-spectrum model of the marine plankton community to investigate how particulate export and pe-ratio relate to the community size spectrum, community composition, and time-lags between predators and prey. The model generates emergent food-webs with associated size distributions for organisms and detrital particles. To resolve time-lags between phytoplankton and zooplankton, we implement the life-cycle of multicellular zooplankton (here represented by copepods). We find that carbon export correlates best with copepod biomass and trophic level, whereas the pe-ratio correlates best with the exponent of the size spectrum and sea surface temperature (SST). Community metrics performed better than NPP or SST for both deep export and pe-ratio. Time-lags between phytoplankton and copepods did not strongly affect export or pe-ratio. We conclude by discussing how can we reconcile size spectrum theory with field sampling.

TI  - Electromagnetic Fault Analysis of Superconducting Wind Generator with Different Topologies
AB  - Superconducting (SC) direct-drive wind generators are one of the best candidates for the offshore wind energy applications. The gearbox that exists in the traditional wind generators can be removed. Using superconductors in the armature and excitation windings will largely increase the machine torque density. However, the synchronous reactance in a traditional superconducting synchronous machine is usually low due to its large air gap. Consequently, operating faults will largely threat the machine itself. Also, the superconductor needs to work in the low temperature, usually around 30 K. The magnetic field around it and the current flows in it are also limited. Thus, to improve the machine reliability, the superconducting system needs to be taken care. In this paper, a double stator superconducting flux modulation machine (DSSFMM) is studied and its fault performances are analyzed. From the results, both fault current and fault torque in this kind of machine are low. It is also indicated that the AC loss of the SC coils during fault condition is low. Â© 2002-2011 IEEE.

TI  - Improved evaluation of the wind power potential of a large offshore wind farm using four analytical wake models
AB  - The objective of this paper is to investigate the ability of analytical wake models to estimate the wake effects between wind turbines (WTs). The interaction of multiple wakes reduces the total power output produced by a large offshore wind farm (LOFWF). This power loss is due to the effect of turbine spacing (WTS), if the WTs are too close, the power loss is very significant. Therefore, the optimization of turbine positions within the offshore wind farm requires an understanding of the interaction of wakes inside the wind farm. To better understand the wake effect, the Horns Rev 1 offshore wind farm has been studied with four wake models, Jensen, Larsen, Ishihara, and Frandsen. A comparative study of the wake models has been performed in several situations and configurations, single and multiple wakes are taken into consideration. Results from the Horns Rev1 offshore wind farm case have been evaluated and compared to observational data, and also with the previous studies. The power output of a row of WTs is sensitive to the wind direction. For example, if a row of ten turbines is aligned with the 270Â° wind direction, the full wake condition of WTs is reached and the power deficit limit predicted by Jensen model exceeds 70%. When a wind direction changes only of 10Â° (260Â° and 280Â°), the deficit limit reduces to 30%. The obtained results show that a significant power deficit occurs when the turbines are arranged in an aligned manner. The findings also showed that all four models gave acceptable predictions of the total power output. The comparison between the calculated and reported power output of Horns Revs 1 showed that the differences ranged from-8.27 MW (12.49%) to 15.27 MW (23.06%) for the Larsen and Frandsen models, respectively.

TI  - Potential on-shore and off-shore reservoirs for CO2 sequestration in Central Atlantic magmatic province basalts
AB  - Identifying locations for secure sequestration of CO2 in geological formations is one of our most pressing global scientific problems. Injection into basalt formations provides unique and significant advantages over other potential geological storage options, including large potential storage volumes and permanent fixation of carbon by mineralization. The Central Atlantic Magmatic Province basalt flows along the eastern seaboard of the United States may provide large and secure storage reservoirs both onshore and offshore. Sites in the South Georgia basin, the New York Bight basin, and the Sandy Hook basin offer promising basalt-hosted reservoirs with considerable potential for CO2 sequestration due to their proximity to major metropolitan centers, and thus to large industrial sources for CO2. Onshore sites are suggested for cost-effective characterization studies of these reservoirs, although offshore sites may offer larger potential capacity and additional long-term advantages for safe and secure CO2 sequestration.

TI  - Close-proximity tidal phasing for â€˜firmâ€™ electricity supply
AB  - Tidal generation is highly predictable and thus an attractive renewable energy source to develop; however, output varies over short time scales. This can be mitigated through phasing of output between sites, as different locations have different timings of output. Phasing can be increased by geographical diversity; unfortunately areas with tidal resources suitable for generation are few, so the opportunity for this is limited. The Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters (PFOW) contain the World's first leased sites for tidal stream generation. This paper focuses on close-proximity phasing between these leases and their ability to provide firm power, i.e. a guaranteed level of output. Results show phasing across individual leases and over the PFOW; combined output from all the lease areas exceeds 1% of nameplate capacity for 97.9% of the study, compared to 83.4%â€“94.5% for the individual leases. Relatively little storage makes significant levels of firm capacity obtainable; 255Â MWh of storage means electricity demand of the two counties the developments fall within would be met âˆ¼94% of the time. The methodology identifies lease suitability, high energy locations within leases, and quantifies the complementary characteristics of different tidal sites. This could inform strategic development of tidal sites, to maximise firm capacity. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Modelling tidal current turbine wakes using a coupled RANS-BEMT approach as a tool for analysing power capture of arrays of turbines
AB  - An improved method is developed to couple an inner domain solution of the blade element momentum theory with an outer domain solution of the Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes equations for evaluating performance of tidal current turbines. A mesh sensitivity study shows that a mesh of at least 6 M cells with at least 40% of these within the turbine wake is required to ensure satisfactory convergence of the velocity deficit. In addition to the usually applied axial momentum source terms, angular momentum and turbulence intensity source terms are shown to be required to model the near wake evolution. Three different lateral turbine spacing of 2, 4 and 6 turbine diameters are used to demonstrate the influence of the effective channel blockage on the velocity distribution in the turbine bypass region, the rate of spread of the wake and the recovery of velocity distribution. A final study shows that for a fixed number of turbines minimising the lateral spacing within each row, with a small number of staggered rows spaced as longitudinally as far apart as practical, is the most effective strategy for energy capture.

TI  - Design of a multi-use marine area off-shore the Mediterranean Sea
AB  - The existing pressures on coastal areas are prompting the off-shore transfer of economic activities such as aquaculture, transportation, tourism, energy, leading to new challenges for the sustainable use of the sea and calling for integration of different activities in the same area. This paper conceptually designs a multi-use off-shore area in a mild sea, whose purpose is the setup of an energetically self-sustained fish farm. The climate conditions for aquaculture and renewable energy production are assessed first. The features and production of the fish farm are then designed, as well as the renewable energy system offering the power support. A new dedicated tool is presented and adopted for the set-up and sizing of the electrical system required for the power stabilisation and energy supply in case the multi-use area is not grid-connected. The layout and payback time of the multi-use are finally examined, showing that wave energy systems are still far to make such installation economically competitive. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - The Optical Measurement of CO2 Clathrate Hydrate Membrane Thickness
AB  - The technology of the deep-ocean CO2 storage is expected to directly mitigate the source of the global warming. At deep-ocean condition above 4.45 MPa and below 283 K, the CO2 clathrate hydrate crystals are formed as membrane at the interface between the liquid-water phase and the liquid-CO2 phase. Since the strength and the thickness of the hydrate membrane are crucial to the storage period, it is important to experimentally measure the mechanical characteristics of the CO2 hydrate membrane and the hydrate droplet. In the present study, the CO2 hydrate membrane thickness is measured by using the laser-light interference method. It is clarified that the present method by using the beam light interference method is applicable to measure the CO2 hydrate membrane. The hydrate membrane thickness is estimated to be about 7 mu m similar to 12 mu m at 10MPa and 275 K similar to 283 K. It is also clarified that thickness of the CO2 hydrate membrane is in proportion to the temperature.

TI  - Layout optimization of heaving Wave Energy Converters linear arrays in front of a vertical wall
AB  - The present paper focuses on the determination of optimum layouts for linear arrays of heaving Wave Energy Converters (WECs) in front of a vertical wall. Optimum layouts maximize the annual averaged absorbed energy at a given marine site and satisfy spatial constraints. For achieving this goal, we developed an efficient optimization numerical framework, where a genetic algorithm solver is appropriately coupled with a frequency-domain hydrodynamic model, while, furthermore, a numerical wave model is utilized to determine the local wave climate conditions at the site of interest. The context is applied for an array of five semi-immersed, oblate spheroidal heaving WECs deployed at five near-shore sites of mild wave environments in the Aegean Sea, Greece. For each site, different optimization cases are solved, facilitating the investigation of different aspects of the examined problem. The largest annual energy absorption ability is observed for optimum layouts, characterized by the placement of the array close to the wall and the formation of clusters of closely-positioned WECs near the wall edges. Compared to arrays employed at sites in south-eastern Aegean, optimally-arranged arrays at central Aegean locations showed reduced energy absorption ability due to milder local wave conditions and/or the existence of quite limited water depths.

TI  - Optimization of reliable cyclic cable layouts in offshore wind farms
AB  - A novel approach for optimizing reliable cable layouts in offshore wind farms is presented. While optimization models traditionally are designed to suggest acyclic cable routes, those developed in this work recognize that cyclic layouts reduce the consequences of cable failures. The models under study take into account that cables cannot cross each other, which, particularly in instances with restrictive cable capacity, can make it attractive to let cables follow a joint trajectory, and visit turbines without connecting to them. A two-layered optimization process is developed. The outer layer is associated with an integer programming problem, which is subject to simultaneous generation of rows and columns representing cable paths. In the inner layer, a problem identifying feasible low cost paths is solved, guided by optimal dual variable values in the continuous relaxation of the former problem. Results from experimental applications to existing wind farms show good promise of the method. Â© 2020 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - SYSTEM SIMULATION-BASED FEASIBILITY and PERFORMANCE STUDY of ALTERNATIVE FUEL CONCEPTS for AQUACULTURE WELLBOATS
AB  - Climate change and population growth are increasing the need for sustainable food production. The ocean covers around 70% of the earth's surface area and there is a great potential in utilizing this for ocean farming. However, the maritime traffic needs to decrease the emissions per transported mass with 50% by 2030 to meet the Paris Agreement. With an increased ocean space utilization, the vessel fleet will increase due to operational demands. Hence, with increased energy consumption, the need for decarbonization will increase further. Wellboats are one of the main contributors to the CO2-emission related to traditional fish farming production of Atlantic Salmon, not counting the actual feed production. Within the wellboat the fuel system has the highest potential to reduce the carbon footprint. However, one of the major challenges with the renewable fuels are their low energy density compared to fossil fuels. New, promising energy concepts have emerged, but they lack a quantifiable performance evaluation within the complete aquaculture supply chain. Further, the choice of the vessel's engine, generator and consumer modules affect each other. For example, changing to a fuel with lower energy density may lead to a larger fuel storage tank which then limits the available space for the fish tank. The main objective of this study is to use graphical system simulation to model and evaluate the performance of new concepts for low-and zero-carbon fuels. Based on these simula-tions, new fuel concepts can be compared with conventional marine diesel systems. The simulation model can be used to detect operational limitations with respect to range, transported mass (fish), vessel size, weight, and refueling possibilities. Further, it can also be used to identify bottlenecks in terms of size, weight, and voyage limitations. Based on the outcome of the wellboat system simulation model, the feasibility of fuel systems can be evaluated and used as recommendation for the design of new wellboats. The industry needs feasible solutions which are sustainable in terms of reliability and cost. The insights gained from using the simulation model aim to assist the industry to reach their emissions reduction goals by 2030, and to provide decision support for retrofitting the fuel and energy system of wellboats.

TI  - Carbon dioxide sequestration technologies
AB  - Among global environmental problems, particular attention of the world has been focused on the global warming by CO 2 because it has direct linkage to energy consumption which our economic development depends on so far. The proposed scenarios to cope with the problem include : 1) reduction of CO 2 emission through efficiency improvements in energy supply, conversion and end use; 2) fuel substitution by energy sources having lower CO 2 emissions, which includes not only utilization of natural gas instead of coal but also acceleration of introducing carbon free nuclear and renewable energy technologies. Capture and sequestering of CO 2 from thermal power plant is a technological option to reduce greenhouse gas release to atmosphere while using conventional fossil fuels. The paper summarizes the present status of R&amp;D on CO 2 sequestration technologies as well as discusses its economical feasibility and technological potential. One of the essential task is to evaluate a social aspects of the technologies through detailed and prudent examination of the safety and the environmental impact of injecting a large amount of CO 2 into the underground or the ocean. In 1977, MITI has launched a project called "Study on Environmental Assessment for CO 2 Ocean Sequestration for Mitigation of Climate Change" , considering this aspects.

TI  - Design of a solar photovoltaic system for a Ro-Ro ship and estimation of performance analysis: A case study
AB  - Maritime transportation has a remarkable contribution to the increase of pollutant gases in the atmosphere, and adapting alternative energy systems to ship's main power grid is an effective method to both save energy and reduce the amount of emission gases. For this reason, the contribution of solar power, which is one of the effective alternative energy sources, to the marine vessels as a result of adaptation to the ship's power system and the environmental impacts of application is evaluated within the scope of the study. A novel approach is demonstrated for the layout of solar arrays within a Ro-Ro type marine vessel navigated between Pendik/Turkey and Trieste/Italy during 2018, and the performance of the designed system is theoretically evaluated. According to followed methodology, 7.76% of energy efficiency is carried out and 7.38% of the fuel requirement of the stated vessel is met by the designed solar system. 0.312 tons of SOx, 3.942 tons of NOx, 232.393 tons of CO2, and 0.114 tons of PM are prevented from releasing to the atmosphere. Besides, the investment of the solar system is analyzed under three different economic indicators and is found to be economically profitable to implement on the ship.

Using gatekeeping theory as a framework, this research analyzes local and regional/national newspaper coverage of the BIWF paying particular attention to the use of sources. The data suggest that the differences between newspaper source usage from 1 January 2008 to 1 July 2017 is minimal. However, business sources appeared more than any other group, including government sources, which is a new finding. The prevalence of business sources leads to important questions about the role of businesses in shaping narratives about community transitions to renewable energy systems.

TI  - Development of heat storage and delivery system using wasted hot water
AB  - This paper mainly concerns about the heat storage and delivery(HSD) of wasted hot water and the purpose of this proposed system are to reduce the cost and save the wasted thermal energy. It is eco-friendly which is new to the world, and it is known as vertical aquarium energy management system (VAEMS). The main concept of this project is to recycle the wasted hot water, which is produced from the power plants. This hot water after delivered from power plants to the aquarium which is filled in the vertical aquarium for aquaculture. It can be achieved by the thermal energy management system and it is a solution to utilize various energy systems more effectively. The process of hot water is to maintain constant thermal equilibrium temperature of water in the aquarium that is suitable to live fish. These days, aqua industries are spending more money to heat the water as well as it produces pollution and other end thermal power plants discharge the wasted hot water directly into the ocean, it causes thermal pollution. The basic components of this system are heat delivery system made with phase change material (PCM), cylindrical tank and fin type tube. From this, the phase change material is used to keep the thermal energy until reach the destination from power plants through fin tube. The experimental result of heat storage and delivery system has been satisfied to install on the site. Â© 2017 IEEE.

TI  - Variational modelling of waveâ€“structure interactions with an offshore wind-turbine mast
AB  - We consider the development of aÂ mathematical model of water waves interacting with the mast of an offshore wind turbine. AÂ variational approach is used for which the starting point is an action functional describing a dual system comprising aÂ potential-flow fluid, aÂ solid structure modelled with nonlinear elasticity, and the coupling between them. We develop aÂ linearized model of the fluidâ€“structure or waveâ€“mast coupling, which is a linearization of the variational principle for the fully coupled nonlinear model. Our numerical results for the linear case indicate that our variational approach yields a stable numerical discretization of a fully coupled model of water waves and an elastic beam. The energy exchange between the subsystems is seen to be in balance, yielding aÂ total energy that shows only small and bounded oscillations amplitude of which tends to zero with the second-order convergence as the timestep approaches zero. Similar second-order convergence is observed for spatial mesh refinement. The linearized model so far developed can be extended to aÂ nonlinear regime. Â© 2017, The Author(s).

TI  - Towards Population-Based Structural Health Monitoring, Part VII: EOV Fields â€“ Environmental Mapping
AB  - In a population-based structural health monitoring setting, data from one structure in a population, where the health state is known, may be used to make inferences about the health state in any nominally-identical structure. Any deviation from the learned â€˜healthy responseâ€™ potentially indicates damage. However, as in standard applications of structural health monitoring, the healthy response from different structures also varies with the changes in environmental conditions across the population. This paper investigates the modelling of the change in environment across a population of structures located in one geographical region, such as a wind turbine farm. A data-driven mapping method (based on Gaussian process regression) will be introduced that aims to quantify and normalise variation stemming from the environment, such that the remaining response is only sensitive to damage or performance anomalies. The way in which environmental maps are constructed and implemented is demonstrated via a case study from an offshore wind farm. The ideas introduced here will constitute a field in the framework of population-based structural health monitoring presented elsewhere in the conference.

TI  - Parque das Conchas (BC-10) steel lazy wave riser installation, preabandonment, recovery and transfer challenges
AB  - The Parque das Conchas (BC-10) project is located in deepwater, in block BC-10, off the coast of Brazil. It comprises a number of subsea fields tied back to a centrally located turret moored Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) host in some 1800 meters of water. This paper describes the installation engineering challenges for the 7 Steel Lazy Wave Risers (SLWR) and the dynamic sections of the 3 umbilicals that are part of the Phase 1 scope of the project. To decouple the schedule risk of the installation of the subsea systems from the FPSO arrival schedule, a pre-abandonment, recovery and transfer method of the SLWR and umbilical in lazy wave configuration was chosen. Successful installation of SLWR by this method to the FPSO turret required the design of a suitable pre-abandonment layout taking into consideration the instillation sequence and careful assessment of the risks involved particularly in terms of clearance and interference issues with FPSO mooring lines and the already transferred SLWRs/ umbilicals. Pre-abardonment, recovery and transfer by keel haul of this "worlds first" SLWR system had a number of challenges that had to be overcome. These include determining the pre-abandonment route of SLWR, lay tension to balance curve stability, lazy wave 'hump' stability while on seabed, lay stresses on flex joint, etc. The recovery and transfer operations had challenges associated with clearance monitoring with mooring lines and already installed risers as well as maintaining the design touch down points. The pre-abandonment layout was developed using Shell's in-house design tool for high level assessment followed by detailed engineering installation analysis by Subsea7 using Orcaflex. This enabled the development of analytical procedures to assess and mitigate the risks involved in pre-abandonment, recovery and transfer operation of SLWR. Subsea7's construction vessel 'Seven Oceans' performed the SLWR and dynamic umbilical installation activities. This paper describes how this complex riser operation was modeled and successfully executed. Copyright 2010, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - LIMITING FUTURE ATMOSPHERIC CARBON-DIOXIDE
AB  - We estimate anthropogenic carbon emissions required to stabilize future atmospheric CO2 at various levels ranging from 350 ppm to 750 ppm. Over the next three centuries, uptake by the ocean and terrestrial biosphere would permit emissions to be 3 to 6 times greater than the total atmospheric increase, with each of them contributing approximately equal amounts. Owing to the nonlinear dependence of oceanic and terrestrial biospheric uptake on CO2 concentration, the uptake by these two sinks decreases substantially at higher atmospheric CO2 levels. The uptake also decreases with increased atmospheric CO2 growth rate. All the stabilization scenarios require a substantial future reduction in emissions.

TI  - Introducing offshore wind energy in the sea space: Canary Islands case study developed under Maritime Spatial Planning principles
AB  - In this study, we define a novel methodological approach for introducing Offshore Wind Energy (OWE) facilities into sea space, determining the most suitable locations with regard to the five clusters: oceanographic potential; environmental sensibility; restrictions related to marine conservation; Land-Sea interactions; and avoiding potential conflict with current maritime and coastal activities. The methodology was tested along 1.583 km of the Canary Islands coastline and across more than 50 000 km(2) of related offshore areas. We have identified marine areas that have significant wind\&depth potential, minimal impact on the marine environment, compatibility with marine conservation and conflict avoidance with operative economic maritime and coastal sectors (such as coastal tourism, fisheries, aquaculture, maritime transport, etc.). Suitability maps were developed with Decision Support System INDIMAR, a novel tool that analyses the OWE facilities' relationship with each cluster parameter, introducing weights calculated by an Analytical Hierarchy Process. OWE development needs to find a balance of all five clusters reflecting on Ecosystem-Based Management components that should be mirrored in the Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) strategy, including options with tradeoffs among sectorial growth, conflict prevention and environmental protection \& conservation.

TI  - Enhanced carbon dioxide uptake by the world's oceans
AB  - The growth of phytoplankton over much of the ocean is limited by the availability of nitrogen in the upper sunlit region of the ocean. It is through photosynthesis that upper ocean carbon is exported to the deep ocean and replaced with carbon dioxide fluxed by physical processes from the atmosphere. The addition of nitrogen to the ocean surface waters has the potential to recycle the carbon released by burning fossil fuels. It is possible to predict the nitrogen needed by phytoplankton to absorb the carbon dioxide for, say, the IPCC emission scenario B. We have used a Redfield ratio of C:N:P of 130:16:1 and an efficiency of 70\%. It is of interest to compare the increase of carbon uptake due to the nitrogen nourishment required for greenhouse gas mitigation with the new primary production of the world's oceans. Not until the year 2100 would the primary production need to be doubled under such a carbon dioxide stabilisation scheme. This is in contrast with terrestrial regions where some modellers estimate that, in order to feed the population increases predicted by the United Nations, the new primary production on land will need to double by 2020. The addition of nitrogen to the upper ocean, as well as sequestering CO2 can be expected to increase the fish landings. If one assumes that the fisheries production rises in proportion to new primary production of the oceans, then each tonne of nitrogen taken up in the upper ocean would increase the fish landings by order 260 Kg.

TI  - Correlations of power output fluctuations in an offshore wind farm using high-resolution SCADA data
AB  - Space-time correlations of power output fluctuations of wind turbine pairs provide information on the flow conditions within a wind farm and the interactions of wind turbines. Such information can play an essential role in controlling wind turbines and short-term load or power forecasting. However, the challenges of analysing correlations of power output fluctuations in a wind farm are the highly varying flow conditions. Here, we present an approach to investigate space-time correlations of power output fluctuations of streamwise-aligned wind turbine pairs based on high-resolution supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data. The proposed approach overcomes the challenge of spatially variable and temporally variable flow conditions within the wind farm. We analyse the influences of the different statistics of the power output of wind turbines on the correlations of power output fluctuations based on 8 months of measurements from an offshore wind farm with 80 wind turbines. First, we assess the effect of the wind direction on the correlations of power output fluctuations of wind turbine pairs. We show that the correlations are highest for the streamwise-aligned wind turbine pairs and decrease when the mean wind direction changes its angle to be more perpendicular to the pair. Further, we show that the correlations for streamwise-aligned wind turbine pairs depend on the location of the wind turbines within the wind farm and on their inflow conditions (free stream or wake). Our primary result is that the standard deviations of the power output fluctuations and the normalised power difference of the wind turbines in a pair can characterise the correlations of power output fluctuations of streamwise-aligned wind turbine pairs. Further, we show that clustering can be used to identify different correlation curves. For this, we employ the data-driven k-means clustering algorithm to cluster the standard deviations of the power output fluctuations of the wind turbines and the normalised power difference of the wind turbines in a pair. Thereby, wind turbine pairs with similar power output fluctuation correlations are clustered independently from their location. With this, we account for the highly variable flow conditions inside a wind farm, which unpredictably influence the correlations. Â© 2021 Janna Kristina Seifert et al.

TI  - Review on carbon capture in ice driven transport
AB  - The transport sector powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) requires novel ap-proaches to achieve near-zero CO2 emissions. In this direction, using CO2 capture and storage (CCS) systems onboard could be a good option. However, CO2 capture in mobile sources is currently challenging due to the operational and space requirements to install a CCS system onboard. This paper presents a systematic review of the CO2 capture in ICE driven transport to know the methods, techniques, and results of the different studies published so far. Subsequently, a case study of a CCS system working in an ICE is presented, where the energy and space needs are evaluated. The review reveals that the most suitable technique for CO2 capture is temperature swing adsorption (TSA). Moreover, the sorbents with better properties for this task are PPN-6-CH2-DETA and MOF-74-Mg. Finally, it shows that it is necessary to supply the energy demand of the CCS system and the option is to take advantage of the waste heat in the flue gas. The case study shows that it is possible to have a carbon capture rate above 68% without affecting engine performance. It was also found that the total volume required by the CCS system and fuel tank is 3.75 times smaller than buses operating with hydrogen fuel cells. According to the review and the case study, it is possible to run a CCS system in the maritime sector and road freight transport. Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Unravelling historical cost developments of offshore wind energy in Europe
AB  - This paper aims to provide insights in the cost developments of offshore wind energy in Europe. This is done by analysing 46 operational offshore wind farms commissioned after 2000. An increase of the Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) is found that is linked to the distance to shore and depth of more recent wind farms and commodity prices. Analysis results indicate that these two factors are only responsible for about half of the observed CAPEX increase, suggesting other factors such as turbine market with limited competition also led to an increasing CAPEX. Using CAPEX, Annual Energy Production, Financings costs and Operational Expenditures, the development of average Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCoE) is shown to increase from 120 (sic)/MWh in 2000 towards 190 (sic)/MWh in 2014, which is a direct result of the CAPEX increase. The results indicate very different LCoE values among European countries, from currently about 100 Euro/MWh in Denmark and Sweden to 150-220 Euro/MWh in all other countries investigated suggesting an effect of national policy frameworks on the LCoE of offshore wind energy.

TI  - Hydrogen storage to boost offshore wind
AB  - The ability to store and transport energy as hydrogen means that far more locations in the North Sea and elsewhere will become viable for wind generation. The development of offshore hydrogen production could hold the key to a substantial expansion of power generation in the North Sea while providing greater stability for power prices. However, the main problem associated with expanding offshore wind is that the further the turbine is from land, the greater the electricity connection costs become. Still, the emergence of green hydrogen storage is likely to provide a large boost to the wind and solar energy industry. The European Hydrogen Strategy targets 40 GW of electrolyzer capacity by 2030 and this would need 80-120 GW of renewable power.

TI  - Performance Analysis of a Hybrid Electric Ship by Real-Time Verification
AB  - International maritime transport organizations are proposing regulatory actions and strategies aimed at decarbonizing the sector to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which currently constitute around 3% of the global total. Hybrid propulsion systems have significant potential in this respect, as a means of power-saving in ships. This paper describes a high-fidelity benchmark for hybrid-electric vessels, combining diesel generators and batteries. The benchmark consists of detailed models, the parameters of which are provided so that the models can be reproduced. The proposed hybrid-electric ship topology and control system was validated using real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations on a Typhoon HIL402 platform. The results provide a detailed analysis of the operation of the different components under varying conditions, which should be useful in prototyping these kinds of systems. In addition, the response of the system was evaluated with regard to potential disturbances resulting from the control systemâ€™s operation. The results show the system performed correctly during these transitory events, with no undesirable responses. Â© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - The cost of delaying action to stem climate change
AB  - The signs of climate change are all around us. The average temperature in the United States during the past decade was 0.8Â° Celsius (1.5Â° Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1901-1960 average, and the last decade was the warmest on record both in the United States and globally. Global sea levels are currently rising at approximately 1.25 inches per decade, and the rate of increase appears to be accelerating. Climate change is having different impacts across regions within the United States. In the West, heat waves have become more frequent and more intense, while heavy downpours are increasing throughout the lower 48 States and Alaska, especially in the Midwest and Northeast.1 The scientific consensus is that these changes, and many others, are largely consequences of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases.2 The emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) harms others in a way that is not reflected in the price of carbon-based energy, that is, CO2 emissions create a negative externality. Because the price of carbon-based energy does not reflect the full costs, or economic damages, of CO2 emissions, market forces result in a level of CO2 emissions that is too high. Because of this market failure, public policies are needed to reduce CO2 emissions and thereby to limit the damage to economies and the natural world from further climate change. There is a vigorous public debate over whether to act now to stem climate change or instead to delay implementing mitigation policies until a future date. This report examines the economic consequences of delaying implementing such policies and reaches two main conclusions, both of which point to the benefits of implementing mitigation policies now and to the net costs of delaying taking such actions. First, although delaying action can reduce costs in the short run, on net, delaying action to limit the effects of climate change is costly. Because CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere, delaying action increases CO2 concentrations. Thus, if a policy delay leads to higher ultimate CO2 concentrations, that delay produces persistent economic damages that arise from higher temperatures and higher CO2 concentrations. Alternatively, if a delayed policy still aims to hit a given climate target, such as limiting CO2 concentration to given level, then that delay means that the policy, when implemented, must be more stringent and thus more costly in subsequent years. In either case, delay is costly. These costs will take the form of either greater damages from climate change or higher costs associated with implementing more rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. In practice, delay could result in both types of costs. These costs can be large: Based on a leading aggregate damage estimate in the climate economics literature, a delay that results in warming of 3Â° Celsius above preindustrial levels, instead of 2Â°, could increase economic damages by approximately 0.9 percent of global output. To put this percentage in perspective, 0.9 percent of estimated 2014 U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is approximately $150 billion. The incremental cost of an additional degree of warming beyond 3Â° Celsius would be even greater. Moreover, these costs are not onetime, but are rather incurred year after year because of the permanent damage caused by increased climate change resulting from the delay. An analysis of research on the cost of delay for hitting a specified climate target (typically, a given concentration of greenhouse gases) suggests that net mitigation costs increase, on average, by approximately 40 percent for each decade of delay. These costs are higher for more aggressive climate goals: each year of delay means more CO2 emissions, so it becomes increasingly difficult, or even infeasible, to hit a climate target that is likely to yield only moderate temperature increases. Second, climate policy can be thought of as "climate insurance" taken out against the most severe and irreversible potential consequences of climate change. Events such as the rapid melting of ice sheets and the consequent increase of global sea levels, or temperature increases on the higher end of the range of scientific uncertainty, could pose such severe economic consequences as reasonably to be thought of as climate catastrophes. Confronting the possibility of climate catastrophes means taking prudent steps now to reduce the future chances of the most severe consequences of climate change. The longer that action is postponed, the greater will be the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere and the greater is the risk. Just as businesses and individuals guard against severe financial risks by purchasing various forms of insurance, policymakers can take actions now that reduce the chances of triggering the most severe climate events. And, unlike conventional insurance policies, climate policy that serves as climate insurance is an investment that also leads to cleaner air, energy security, and benefits that are difficult to monetize like biological diversity.

TI  - Technical feasibility study of an onshore ballast water treatment system
AB  - To fulfill the requirements of Guidelines for approval of ballast water management system (G8), a set of onshore ballast water treatment equipment utilizing micro-pore ceramic filtration (MPCF) and UV radiation (MPCF\&UV) system was designed and set up with a maximum flow rate of 80 m(3)center dot h(-1). Technical feasibilities of MPCF\&UV system were evaluated in three areas: removal efficiencies of indicator organism and oceanic bacteria, perdurability of a ceramic filter, and application on native seawater. The results showed that no indicator organism (Dunaliella) or oceanic bacteria was detected after treatment of 20 L MPCF and UV radiation at 1.3x10(4) mu W center dot s center dot cm(-2). A 20 L ceramic filter can run continuously for 5.3 h at the flow rate of 15 m(3)center dot h(-1) before its pressure drop up to 0.195 MPa. The removal percentage of total plankton amounts were 91.9\% at a flow rate of 70 m(3)center dot h(-1) by 80 L MPCF and UV radiation at 1.3x10(4) mu W center dot s center dot cm(-2).

TI  - Modeling, analysis, and control for the rectifier of hybrid HVdc systems for DFIG-based wind farms
AB  - In order to improve the dynamic performance of the hybrid HVdc system for doubly fed induction generator wind farms, this paper presents the modeling, analysis, and control methods for its line-commutated rectifier. First, the state variable model of the rectifier subsystem on the dq reference frame is derived considering different control modes of the current source inverter subsystem. Then, the ac current dynamic of the rectifier subsystem is quantitatively analyzed based on the eigenvalue analysis method. According to the analysis results, a double loop control scheme is designed: the inner loop utilizes the inverse system control technique plus a switchable phase-lead compensator, and the outer loop implements an ordinary propotionalintegral controller. Finally, the validity of the quantitative analysis method and the superiority of the proposed control scheme are verified by Simulink/ SimPowerSystems simulations. Â© 2010 IEEE.

TI  - Analysis of the potential for wind and solar energy systems in Antarctica
AB  - As renewable energy generation devices become more efficient and less expensive, the market for providing power to remote communities is expanding. Power for these sites is usually provided by diesel generator sets although, with high winds or solar radiation levels, wind-turbines and solar arrays could prove an ideal alternative. This is especially true for Antarctica. The Australian Antarctic Division currently ships approximately 750,000 litres of diesel fuel annually to each of three continental stations located on the coastline of East Antarctica. These operations are expensive and savings could be expected from the introduction of a renewable energy generation capability. These stations experience strong winds with gusts recorded at up to 81 m/s, together with temperatures often plunging below -30 degrees C in winter. This, while providing adequate meteorological conditions for power generation by wind-turbines, also imposes harsh design criteria. Solar also remains an extremely promising alternative during the summer, but is not viable for the winter. As part of a project investigating `Alternative Energy for Antarctic Stations', analysis of meteorological data has given wind energy capacity factors estimates of up to 0.7, and summer solar energy capacity factors estimates of up to 0.3. These, combined with station load measurements, have been used to determine the optimal sizing of the number and ratio of wind/solar to storage devices. Results indicate that installation of a 110 kW wind turbine capacity at Mawson would result in a 25\% fuel saving, while a 55 kW wind turbine capacity at Macquarie Island would reduce fuel consumption by 30\%.

TI  - Fermentative hydrogen production from Laminaria japonica and optimization of thermal pretreatment conditions
AB  - As a sustainable biofuel feedstock, marine algae have superior aspects to terrestrial biomass such as less energy and water requirement for cultivation, higher CO2 capture capacity, and negligible lignin content. In this study, various marine algae were tested for fermentative hydrogen production (FHP). Among them, Laminaria japonica exhibited the best performance, showing the highest H2 yield of 69.1mL H2/g CODadded. It was attributed to its high carbohydrate content and main constituents of polysaccharides, laminarin and alginate, which were found to posses higher H2 production potential than agar and carrageenan. To enhance the H2 production from L. japonica, thermal pretreatment was applied at various conditions. At 170Â°C and 20min, H2 yield was maximized to 109.6mL H2/g CODadded. The experimental results suggested that marine algae, especially L. japonica, could be used for FHP, and future works would be focused on gaining more energy from the H2 fermentation effluent.

TI  - The role of PFAS in unsettling ocean carbon sequestration
AB  - Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and global climate change have attracted worldwide attention. PFAS have been found all across the planet, from the polar regions to the global ocean. Global oceans have emerged as a substantial sink for the carbon in the environment due to their remarkable capacity to absorb atmospheric carbon. Oceans absorb around 24% of the world's CO2 emissions. Thus, the ocean plays a prominent role in the earth's carbon cycle. However, the widespread application of PFAS in a wide range of products and the inefficient management of PFAS-containing wastes made them ubiquitous pollutants, which are increasingly getting as a pollutant of emerging concern. Marine PFAS pollutants can produce harmful effects on gas exchange and the ocean's carbon cycle. Thus, it leads to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, which eventually adversely affects global warming and climate change. Consequently, threats of marine PFAS to oceans carbon sequestration are discussed in this paper. Marine PFAS pollutants adversely affect the following sectors: (1) The growth and photosynthesis of phytoplankton, (2) development and reproduction of zooplankton by causing toxicity in zooplankton, (3) marine biological pomp, and (4) carbon stock of oceans. In this way, marine PFAS can pose a threat to ocean carbon sequestration. It is expected that this study can develop knowledge about the potential impact of PFAS on ocean carbon sequestration. However, the need for further research to investigate the hidden dimensions of this issue, including the potential scope and scale of this impact, should not be overlooked. Â© 2023.

TI  - CO2-driven ocean acidification repressed the growth of adult sea urchin Strongylocentrotus intermedius by impairing intestine function
AB  - Strongylocentrotus intermedius cultured in the northern Yellow Sea in China was utilized to evaluate the effects of chronic CO2-driven ocean acidification (OA) on adult sea urchins. Based on the projection of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), present natural seawater conditions (pHNBS = 8.10 Â± 0.03) and three laboratory-controlled OA conditions (OA1, Î”pHNBS = âˆ’ 0.3 units; OA2, Î”pHNBS = âˆ’ 0.4 units; OA3, Î”pHNBS = âˆ’ 0.5 units) were employed. After 60-day incubation, our results showed that (1) OA significantly repressed the growth of adult S. intermedius; (2) food consumption tended to be decreased with pH decline; (3) intestinal morphology was changed, and activities of intestinal cellulase and lipase were decreased under acidified conditions; (4) expression levels of two immune-related genes (SiTNF14 and SiTGF-Î²) were altered; (5) rate-limiting enzyme activities of the glycolytic pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TAC) were changed in all OA treatments compared to those of controls.

TI  - A pre-feasibility study of wind resources in Kutubdia Island, Bangladesh
AB  - Kutubdia is one of the coastal islands in Bangladesh. The wind speed data at the wind monitoring station of Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD), Kutubdia, located in a built-up area, appears to be low, but at another location, near the seashore, Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCAS) finds that the wind energy availability should be reasonably high. Considering the surface roughness, obstacle condition and terrain information of the island, a micro-scale prediction has been done using (100 x 100 m(2)) grid cells in the Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program (WAsP) to develop monthly and annual wind atlas and also a wind resource map which shows that at 50 m height, the annual wind speed over Kutubdia coast varies from 5.1 to 5.8 m/s. Southern and Eastern sides of Kutubdia appear to be promising for wind electricity generation using large turbines where wind power density at a height of 50 m or higher is found to be above 200 W/m(2) annually over the year September 1996 to August 1997. It is found that at 30 m height, the coast side of Kutubdia should be sustainable for small turbines. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Storing carbon in earth
AB  - The dilemma is rather straightforward. We are finding more evidence that fossil fuel consumption has produced global warming and climate change, and that continued burning of fossil fuels will make things worse. The most compelling write-up of this sentiment comes from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2001 document, which not only outlines the astonishing depth and variety of evidence to this effect, but also presents simple yet grim predictions about the likeliest changes to sea level, surface temperature and rainfall patterns. At the same time, it seems equally clear that fossil fuel is a vital fixture for our future. The abundance and high energy content of fossil fuels make them unparalleled in terms of cost, convenience and ease of use. Moreover, the rapid growth in energy demand in the United States and abroad makes fossil fuels essential for continued economic growth and human well being. Unfortunately, consumption of these energy sources produces carbon dioxide, the longest lived and most problematic of greenhouse emissions. The way forward will require a reduction of carbon emissions, continued or increased fossil fuel consumption, and economic and population growth for 50 to 100 years. This combination leads us to three options: efficiency improvements, emissions reduction engineering or carbon sequestration. The third option is where geoscientists can have the largest impact. Carbon sequestration is capturing carbon dioxide, either from the atmosphere or emission streams, and storing it in reservoirs, such as plants or soils. Carbon dioxide could be converted to solid chemicals or injected into the deep ocean. All of these approaches come with costs and risks, but the potential pay-off is enormous - a decarbonized energy future that does not involve total overhaul of our carbon-based energy.

TI  - Ballistic transport deep water pipe
AB  - Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) power plants, mariculture, and other large users of deep ocean water need an efficient and economical method of bringing this water to the surface. The ballistic transport deep water pipe is a new concept for raising large amounts of deep-ocean water at low capital and energy cost. Pipe wall friction is avoided by projecting the water upward from a nozzle at the pipe bottom as a free jet appreciably separated from the pipe wall. The naturally imposed pressure difference across the nozzle implies a high speed (approximately 100 m/s) for the jet, so that the pipe diameter for large flows is modest, the pipe cost is low, and the deployability is easy. A 670-m deep pipe of average diam .7 m operating at 15 cubic meters/sec flow, will have less than 4 m gravity head loss, and a weight of the order of 300,000 lbs.
