TI  - Sustained power output from an algal biophotovoltaic (BPV) platform using selected marine and freshwater microalgae
AB  - The global community has begun tackling the grave repercussions of excessive use of fossil fuels by strategizing co-usage of renewable and non-renewable energy sources as major energy providers. Recently, biomass feedstocks including microalgae are gaining recognition as crucial energy providers to cope with the demands of the fast expanding economic and social sectors. Algae, known as one of the most photosynthetically efficient organisms, are amenable to growth on a variety of substrates, and are tolerant towards extreme conditions. The integration of microalgae into photovoltaic platforms is an innovative energy provisioning technique for low-power appliances and circuits. Our algal biophotovoltaic (BPV) platforms have undergone multiple refinements, advancing from an ITO-based anode with biofilm grown on its surface prototype to the current integrated, multi-functional device that produces bioelectricity, bioremediates wastewater and assimilates carbon dioxide (CO2). This study explores the ability of our algal BPV platforms in sustaining power output as well as their performance after nutrient replenishment. Our BPV prototype devices generated up to 32.83Â Î¼WÂ mâˆ’2 from the freshwater cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus UMACC 105 and 0.11Â Î¼WÂ mâˆ’2 from the marine alga Chlorella vulgaris UMACC 258. Power output was maintained by both freshwater and marine microalgal strains for 50Â days, thus demonstrating their high potential as long-term low power generators throughout an extended duration in a minimal stress environment.

TI  - Parametric study of blade shape to enhance performance of a turbine used in OWC
AB  - The Oscillating Water Column (OWC) wave energy converter with impulse turbine is widely used for wave energy conversion because of its wide operating range. To improve the starting characteristics and conversion efficiency of the turbine, several studies have been conducted. This paper investigates the effect of blade shape numerically on the performance of the turbine under steady flow conditions using Ansys CFX V 14.5. A constant chord length is used and the thickness of the blade is increased with radius from hub to tip. The main objective is to minimize the flow separation on the suction side of the blade near the trailing edge. The results are validated with the experimental results available in the literature. The performance of blades with various thickness has been compared with that of the original blade. It was found that the blade thickness influences the turbine performance considerably.

TI  - Inhibiting wax deposition using palm oil additives
AB  - Among the various flow assurance problems that the petroleum industry faces, the deposition of paraffin waxes on to the wall of the pipeline is the most challenging. The challenge arises when the crude oil temperature decreases below the wax appearance temperature (WAT) which leads to the wax crystal in the crude oil to crystallize. An efficient method in remedying paraffin wax deposition is the utilization of chemical inhibitors. However, currently used chemical inhibitors are costly and environmentally harmful if a spillage occurs. Therefore, the use of biodegradable or environmently friendly inhibitors as potential chemical inhibitors are being studied by various researchers. This study investigated oleic acid, poly (ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA) and triethanolamine (TEA) as inhibitors that perform based on the van der Waals intermolecular interaction between the main wax component molecule eicosane C20H42 using the molecular dynamics simulation (MD) procedure via Material Studio 8.0 software package. In order to analyse the desired structural property which is the Radial Distribution Function (RDF), COMPASS force field was used. The RDF and g(r) function portrayed the functional atoms which aid in inhibiting the agglomeration and crystallization of the wax crystal formation. The presence of a carbonyl oxygen in oleic acid plays a vital role to inhibit the wax formation through the van der Waals interaction between active hydrogen atoms in eicosane molecule. Therefore, the chances of wax inhibition in eicosane is higher by introducing oleic acid as an inhibitor as compared to EVA and TEA. The results were then validated experimentally utilizing a cold finger technique under static condition. Copyright Â© 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Self-powered metal surface anti-corrosion protection using energy harvested from rain drops and wind
AB  - Corrosion of metal surfaces, especially ships and cultural relics, is one of the most concerns in asset protection, which costs billions of dollars worldwide each year. For the protection of metal surfaces, cathodic protection (CP) has been widely used as a primary technology. However, the application of the technology results in high energy cost and more serious environmental pollutions. In this work, a self-powered CP system for metal surface protection was designed by utilizing the energy harvested from natural rain drops and wind using a flexible triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). The TENG power-supplying system can provide a practical energy source for sustainably driving the CP process without using an external power source. Stereoscopic microscopy, AC impedance measurements, polarization test and surface tension testing were used to verify the feasibility of self-powered CP process. Our results indicate that the flexible TENG can produce highly efficient CP system for almost all metallic structures. This work not only demonstrates a highly-simple-fabrication, great-performance and cost-effect approach to protect metal surfaces from corrosion, but also develops a new self-powered electrochemical technique for CP that can be widely used in metal cultural relics, ocean engineering, industry, transportation, and so on.

TI  - Wind Profiles and Wave Spectra for Potential Wind Farms in South China Sea. Part II: Wave Spectrum Model
AB  - Along with the commercialization of offshore wind energy in China, the South China Sea has been identified as ideal for constructing offshore wind farms, especially for farms consisting of floating wind turbines over deep waters. Since the wind profiles and wave spectra are somewhat primitive for the design of an offshore wind turbine, engineering models describing the wind and wave characteristics in the South China Sea area are necessary for the offshore wind energy exploitation given the meteorological, hydrological, and geographical differences between the South China Sea and the North/Norwegian Sea, where the commonly used wind profile and wave spectrum models were designated. In the present study; a series of numerical simulations were conducted to reveal the wave characteristics in the South China Sea under both typhoon and non-typhoon conditions. By analyzing the simulation results; the applicability of the Joint North Sea Wave Project (JONSWAP) spectrum model; in terms of characterizing the wind-induced wave fields in the South China Sea; was discussed. In detail; the key parameters of the JONSWAP spectrum model; such as the Phillips constant; spectral width parameter; peak-enhancement factor, and high frequency tail decay; were investigated in the context of finding suitable values.

TI  - Feedforward control for wave disturbance rejection on floating offshore wind turbines
AB  - Floating offshore wind turbines allow wind energy to be harvested in deep waters. However, additional dynamics and structural loads may result when the floating platform is being excited by wind and waves. In this work, the conventional wind turbine controller is complemented with a novel linear feedforward controller based on wave measurements. The objective of the feedforward controller is to attenuate rotor speed variations caused by wave forcing. To design this controller, a linear model is developed that describes the system response to incident waves. The performance of the feedback-feedforward controller is assessed by a high-fidelity numerical tool using the DTU 10MW turbine and the INNWIND.EU TripleSpar platform as references. Simulations in the presence of irregular waves and turbulent wind show that the feedforward controller effectively compensates the wave-induced rotor oscillations. The novel controller is able to reduce the rotor speed variance by 26\%. As a result, the remaining rotor speed variance is only 4\% higher compared to operation in still water.

TI  - A reliability evaluation method for independent small offshore electric systems
AB  - As an independent power system, the reliability of offshore electric system is closely related to the smooth progress of offshore oil production. There are two major characteristics of this type of power system. One is that it includes a generation system, transmission system, as well as a distribution system, and the other is that the load shedding measures in the event of a fault are different from that of the onshore power grid. Therefore, traditional reliability assessment models and algorithms cannot be used directly. Based on the theory of overall reliability evaluation, a reliability evaluation method suitable for offshore electric systems and the corresponding reliability indicators are proposed in this paper. In state sampling, the overall system sampling is divided into generation system sampling, transmission system sampling, and distribution system sampling based on the hybrid sampling theory. In state assessment, the priority decoupling load shedding model and the cascade fault model are established considering the actual production. At the end of this paper, the power system of an offshore oil platform is taken as an actual example to calculate the reliability index. Based on the failure analysis, relevant measures to improve the reliability of the system are proposed. Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Simulation of an offshore wind farm using fluid power for centralized electricity generation
AB  - A centralized approach for electricity generation within a wind farm is explored through the use of fluid power technology. This concept considers a new way of generation, collection and transmission of wind energy inside a wind farm, in which electrical conversion does not occur during any intermediate conversion step before the energy has reached the offshore central platform. A numerical model was developed to capture the relevant physics from the dynamic interaction between different turbines coupled to a common hydraulic network and controller. This paper presents a few examples of the time domain simulation results for a hypothetical hydraulic wind farm subject to turbulent wind conditions. The performance and operational parameters of individual turbines are compared with those of a reference wind farm based on conventional wind turbine generator technology using the same wind farm layout and environmental conditions. For the presented case studies, results indicate that the individual wind turbines are able to operate within operational limits. Despite the stochastic turbulent wind conditions and wake effects, the hydraulic wind farm is able to produce electricity with reasonable performance in both below and above rated conditions. With the current pressure control concept, a continuous operation of the hydraulic wind farm is shown including the full stop of one or more turbines. Â© 2017 Author(s).

TI  - Mapping geological hydrogen storage capacity and regional heating demands: An applied UK case study
AB  - Hydrogen is considered as a low-carbon substitute for natural gas in the otherwise difficult to decarbonise domestic heating sector. This study presents for the first time, a globally applicable source to sink methodology and analysis that matches geological storage capacity with energy demand. As a case study, it is applied to the domestic heating system in the UK, with a focus on maintaining the existing gas distribution network. To balance the significant annual cyclicity in energy demand for heating, hydrogen could be stored in gas fields offshore and transported via offshore pipelines to the existing gas terminals into the gas network. The hydrogen energy storage demand in the UK is estimated to be ~77.9 terawatt-hour (TWh), which is approximately 25% of the total energy from natural gas used for domestic heating. The total estimated storage capacity of the gas fields included in this study is 2661.9 TWh. The study reveals that only a few offshore gas fields are required to store enough energy as hydrogen to balance the entire seasonal demand for UK domestic heating. It also demonstrates that as so few fields are required, hydrogen storage will not compete for the subsurface space required for other low-carbon subsurface applications, such as carbon storage or compressed air energy storage.

TI  - SECURING ENERGY SUPPLY AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL THE CASE OF WIND FARMING IN GERMANY A COMPARISON OF TWO CASE STUDIES FROM NORTH HESSE AND WEST SAXONY
AB  - Wind power is one way we can reduce our dependency on fossil fuel imports and mitigate climate change However, wind power can play this important role only if sufficient space for wind farming is made available off-shore as well as on-shore including sites far away from the seashores Against this background this paper presents a comparative analysis of two hinterland case studies from Germany Applying GIS and official wind speed data we evaluate the effectiveness of designated wind farming areas in the regions of West Saxony and North Hesse in terms of their expected wind energy yields and potential for repowering We show that, in this respect, the current spatial allocation for wind power generation in both study regions is not as effective as it could be, but for different reasons We contrast this finding with an alternative proposal which not only meets the legal requirements for wind power generation but also yields better results in terms of expected energy output This proposal takes into account the availability of different turbine types and a spatial re-allocation of wind farming areas within the study regions

TI  - Experimental validation of the energy ship concept for far-offshore wind energy conversion
AB  - The energy ship is a new concept for offshore wind energy capture. It consists of a wind-propelled ship that generates electricity using water turbines attached underneath its hull. Since it is not grid-connected, the generated energy is stored aboard the ship (for instance, using batteries or through conversion to hydrogen using an electrolyzer). This concept has received little attention until today. Particularly, there had not been yet an experimental proof-of-concept. In order to bridge this gap, an experimental platform has been developed at Centrale Nantes. It consists of a 5.5 m long catamaran equipped with a 240 mm diameter water turbine. The platform was tested in July 2019 on the river Erdre (France). Results show that a full-scale energy ship could deliver high levels of power production (megawatts); and that it is essential to optimize the water turbine induced drag in order to maximize energy production.

TI  - A review of offshore wind farm layout optimization and electrical system design methods
AB  - There is more wind with less turbulence offshore compared with an onshore case, which drives the development of the offshore wind farm worldwide. Since a huge amount of money is required for constructing an offshore wind farm, many types of research have been done on the optimization of the offshore wind farm with the purpose of either minimizing the cost of energy or maximizing the total energy production. There are several factors that have an impact on the performance of the wind farm, mainly energy production of wind farm which is highly decided by the wind condition of construction area and micro-siting of wind turbines (WTs), as well as initial investment which is influenced by both the placement of WTs and the electrical system design, especially the scheme of cable connection layout. In this paper, a review of the state-of-art researches related to the wind farm layout optimization as well as electrical system design including cable connection scheme optimization is presented. The most significant factors that should be considered in the offshore wind farm optimization work is highlighted after reviewing the latest works, and the future needs have been specified.

TI  - The Carbon Stock and Sequestration Rate in Tidal Flats From Coastal China
AB  - Tidal flats form around the estuarine and coastal zone by continuous terrigenous sediment transport and deposition processes. Now a large body of published carbon research work frame within the vegetated area (mangrove forests, sea grass bed, and salt marshes). Nonvegetated tidal flats, which are characterized by predominantly silts and clays sediment, were generally impressed with low carbon stock due to their meager primary productivity. However, these regions may be a potentially important carbon sink, given their high burial rate, expanding areal coverage, and detrial organic carbon derived from watershed and adjacent vegetated area. Low carbon densities (<0.01 g cm(-3)) were found in Chinese tidal flat sediments by the study, but the carbon sequestration rates ranged from 35 to 361 g C m(-2) yr(-1), which were comparable to rates of worldwide vegetated coastal areas. The high rates can be ascribed to rapid sedimentation rates (1-2 cm yr(-1)) during the past several decades. The highest areal carbon stocks were located at tidal flat sites proximal to mangrove forests. The majority of carbon stocks (100 cm) was found in the unvegetated tidal flats instead of in the vegetated tidal flats. The former occupied 87\% of the entire tidal area, 6.7 times larger than the latter. Tidal flats in coastal China store 78.07 Tg C (100 cm), accounting for nearly 80\% of the C deposited in entire coastal tidal area. The future carbon sequestration rates of Chinese tidal flats are facing uncertainties under the pressures of reduced fluvial sediment loads from major rivers.

TI  - Techno economic evaluation of cold energy from Malaysian liquefied natural gas regasification terminals
AB  - In order to cater for increased demand for natural gas (NG) by the industry, Malaysia is required to import liquid natural gas (LNG). This is done through PETRONAS GAS Sdn Bhd. For LNG regasification, two regasification terminals have been set up, one in Sungai Udang Melaka (RGTSU) and another at Pengerang Johor (RGTPJ). RGTSU started operation in 2013 while RGTPJ began operation in 2017. The capacities of RGTSU and RGTPJ are 3.8 (500 mmscfd) and 3.5 (490 mmscfd) MTPA, respectively. RGTSU is an offshore plant and uses an intermediate-fluid-vaporization (IFV) process for regasification. RGTPJ is an onshore plant and employs open-rack vaporization (ORV). It is known that a substantial amount of cold energy is released during the regasification process. However, neither plant captures the cold energy released during regasification. This techno economic study serves to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of the cold energy available during regasification. It was estimated that approximately 47,214 and 88,383 kWh of cold energy could be generated daily at RGTPJ and RGTSU, respectively, during regasification processes. Converting this energy into RTh at 70% thermal eficiency, and taking the commercial rate of 0.549 Sen per RTh, for the 20-year project life, an internal rate of return (IRR) of up to 33% and 17% was estimated for RGTPJ and for RGTSU, respectively.

TI  - Understanding developing country stances on post-2012 climate change negotiations: Comparative analysis of Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and South Africa
AB  - An essential issue in future climate negotiations is how to bring developing countries on board. This paper proposes and applies the two-level interest-based model to analyze the factors that affect the likely stances of the "Plus Five" countries (Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and South Africa) on international climate negotiations. This study finds mitigation capability to be a crucial factor which consists of at least such sub-factors as per capita income, energy endowment, and economic structure, while ecological vulnerability does not seem to play an important role which includes reductions in agricultural outputs, sea-level rise, climate-related natural disasters, and others. The paper proposes six options in an ascending order of stringency that the Plus Five are likely to adopt. The paper suggests that the "Basic Four" (the Plus Five excluding Mexico), particularly China and India, are less likely to adopt a voluntary commitment to an emissions cap on the national economy in the near future than Mexico, which has the highest mitigation capability among all five. The Basic Four are likely to adopt more stringent climate polices with increasing mitigation capabilities, suggesting the importance of effective international financial and technology transfer mechanisms and further tighten emission reduction targets from developed countries.

TI  - Preface and brief synthesis for the FOODBANCS volume
AB  - In this volume we present results from the FOODBANCS Project, which examined the fate and benthic community impact of summer bloom material on the West Antarctic Peninsula shelf floor. The project involved a 5-cruise, 15-month time-series program in which sediment-trap moorings, core sampling, radiochemical profiling, sediment respirometry, bottom photography, and bottom trawling were used to evaluate: (1) seafloor deposition and lability of POC, (2) patterns of labile POC consumption and sediment mixing by benthos, and (3) seasonal and inter-annual variations in biotic abundance, biomass, reproductive condition, recruitment, and sediment community respiration. We find that the seafloor flux and accumulation of particulate organic carbon on the West Antarctic Peninsula shelf exhibit intense seasonal and interannual variability. Nonetheless, many key benthic processes, including organic-matter degradation, bioturbation, deposit feeding, and faunal abundance, reproduction and recruitment, show relatively muted response to this intense seasonal and inter-annual variability in export flux. We thus hypothesize that benthic ecosystems on the Antarctic shelf act as "low-pass" filters, and may be extremely useful in resolving the impacts of climatic change over periods of years to decades in Antarctic Peninsula region.

TI  - Tidal energy and main resources in the persian gulf
AB  - Due to increasing concern over global climate change, many policy makers worldwide have accepted the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, in particular from the electricity industry. Tidal generation has a significant advantage over many other forms of renewable generation as it is almost perfectly forecastable over long time horizons. Thus, incorporating tidal generation into an electricity system should be less challenging than other forms of renewable generation which are relatively unpredictable. In this article, we discussed about the capacity benefit of tidal generation, especially in Iran.

TI  - Potential of electricity generation by the salinity gradient energy conversion technologies in the system of Urmia lake-Gadar Chay River
AB  - Energy production from salinity gradients is one of the developing renewable energy sources, and has significant potential for satisfying electrical demands. Urmia Lake is the second hyper-saline lake in the world and there is a significant salinity gradient between the lake's water and the waters of those rivers that flow into the lake. A methodology for determining the feasibility for electrical production using Salinity Gradient Power (SGP) is developed for two different types of systems using this location as an example. Reverse Electrodialysis (RED) and Pressure Retarded Osmosis (PRO), The Gadar Chay River is one of thirteen rivers that run into Urmia Lake; it supports about 10% of the lake's water. In this study, important parameters such as river discharge and the salinity content of river and lake's waters for several years were investigated. The theoretical and technical potential of salinity gradient energy was also determined. These calculations indicate that 206.08 MW of electrical power could be produced at this location when the river flow is approximately 29.82 m3/s and they illustrates the potential for salinity gradient energy extraction between Urmia Lake and The Gadar Chay River.

TI  - Specification design of renewable energy management system for recovery planning of Japanese coastal community after tsunami disaster
AB  - The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and associated tsunami destroyed cities along the Pacific coast of northeast Japan. Large areas, including the city centers, of many cities were completely destroyed. Recovery planning for those cities is one of the most important issues facing Japan. However, recovery plans should not merely rebuild the cities as they were before the disaster, but instead should attempt to add value to the cities. Our team created a conceptual recovery plan for a coastal community in Iwate Prefecture, Japan, introducing a photovoltaic (PV) power plant and storage battery system. Moreover, we proposed the optimal scale of the required PV power plant and energy storage system by using an energy management simulation. Finally, we demonstrated that a PV power plant with a battery storage system can supply the coastal community with electric power stably and can smooth the fluctuations in power supplied by a system power supplier.

TI  - Emission abatement cost analysis of hybrid marine current/photovoltaic/diesel system operation
AB  - The rising of utilization of diesel generators in remote areas of archipelago lead to the increase of CO2 emission on earth. Therefore it is necessary to use renewable energy to reduce the emission. The role of hybrid power generation of marine currents (MC), photovoltaics (PV) and diesel is needed to control power and reduce CO2 emission. This paper aims to analyze the cost of emission abatement by operating the marine current turbin/photovoltaic/diesel generator system. To determine the amount of energy reduction in hybrid usage, it is necessary to know the load, the potential of marine currents and solar radiation to generate electricity and the regulation of the use of diesel generators. Using linear equations, the amount of emission abatement is obtained. The total load requirement (peak load) is 132.24 kW, the power from the marine current is 35 kW while the power from the photovoltaic is 55 kW, the rest is supplied by the diesel generator. There are three types of rated diesel power generators used are 20 kW, 40 kW and 100 kW. The emission generated when the total load requirement of the three generator operations is 36.79 kgCO2/h, whereas if using MC/PV/Diesel hybrid system is 10.98 kgCO2/h or the average daily emission reduction percentage is 70.16%. While the cost of emission reduction from MC/PV/Diesel hybrid system is 8.6 US/day. This suggests that MC/PV/Diesel hybrid energy generation can be applied to meet load requirements and reduce CO2 emissions. Â© 2017 IEEE.

TI  - Temporal and spatial dynamics of tropical macroalgal contributions to blue carbon
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems are a vital part of nature-based climate solutions due to their capacity to store and sequester carbon, but often exclude macroalgal beds even though they can form highly productive coastal ecosystems. Recent estimates of macroalgal contributions to global carbon sequestration are derived primarily from temperate kelp forests, while tropical macroalgal carbon stock in living biomass is still unclear. Here, using Singapore as a case study, we integrate field surveys and remote sensing data to estimate living macroalgal carbon stock. Results show that macroalgae in Singapore account for up to 650 Mg C biomass stock, which is greater than the aboveground carbon found in seagrass meadows but lower than that in mangrove forests. Ulva and Sargassum dominate macroalgal assemblages and biomass along the coast, with both genera exhibiting distinct spatio-temporal variation. The annual range of macroalgal biomass carbon is estimated to be 450 Mg C yrâˆ’1, or 0.77 Mg C haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1. Noting the uncertainties of the fate of macroalgal biomass carbon, we estimate the potential sequestration rate and find that it is comparable to mature terrestrial ecosystems such as tropical grasslands and temperate forests. This study demonstrates that macroalgal seasonality allows for a consistent amount of biomass carbon to either be exported and eventually sequestered, or harvested for utilization on an annual basis. These findings on macroalgal growth patterns and their considerable contributions to tropical coastal carbon pool add to the growing support for macroalgae to be formally included in blue carbon assessments.

TI  - The effects of yawing motion with different frequencies on the hydrodynamic performance of floating vertical-axis tidal current turbines
AB  - Under real sea conditions, the hydrodynamic performance of floating vertical-axis tidal current turbines is affected by waves and currents. The wave circular frequency is a significant factor in determining the frequencies of the wave-induced motion responses of turbines. In this study, the ANSYS-CFX software (manufacturer: ANSYS Inc., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States) is used to analyse the hydrodynamic performance of a vertical-axis turbine for different yawing frequencies and to study how the yawing frequencies affect the main hydrodynamic coefficients of the turbine, including the power coefficient, thrust coefficient, lateral force coefficient, and yawing moment coefficient. The time-varying curves obtained from the CFX software are fitted using the least-squares method; the damping and added mass coefficients are then calculated to analyse the influence of different yawing frequencies. The simulation results demonstrate that when analysing non-yawing turbines rotating under constant inflow, the main hydrodynamic coefficient time-varying curves of yawing turbines exhibit an additional fluctuation. Furthermore, the amplitude is positively correlated with the yawing frequency, and the oscillation amplitudes also increase with increasing yawing frequency; however, the average values of the hydrodynamic coefficients (except the power coefficient) are only weakly influenced by yawing motion. The power coefficient under yawing motion is lower than that under non-yawing motion, which means that yawing motion will cause the annual energy production of a turbine to decrease. The fitting results show that the damping term and the added mass term exert effects of the same level on the loads and moments of vertical-axis turbines under yawing motion. The results of this study can facilitate the study of the motion response of floating vertical-axis tidal current turbine systems in waves. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - IMPACT OF THE SWANSEA BAY LAGOON ON STORM SURGES IN THE BRISTOL CHANNEL
AB  - The proposed Swansea Bay tidal energy lagoon is an example of a relatively small-scale tidal barrage demonstrator project. A key concern with this technology is that such structures may exacerbate other environmental problems. However, such structures might also create beneficial environmental effects in some areas, such as mitigating the impact of storm surges. In this paper we model the hydrodynamics of the Swansea lagoon and surrounding area using a depth-averaged numerical model. We simulate a number of storm surge events from the past 40 years and analyse how the presence of the Swansea Lagoon (under various operating strategies) modifies the resulting water levels.

TI  - Planning of CCS development in the Netherlands offshore
AB  - The offshore gas fields in The Netherlands provide a storage capacity of about 1 Gt, which will become available over the next few decades. Existing production facilities may be re-used for injection. Uncertainties in storage capacity, injection rates and time of availability require an analysis of the feasibility of storing CO2 at the rates currently projected for the period 2015 - 2050. This paper investigates the availability of storage capacity and the feasibility of injecting CO2 at the rate that current capture scenarios foresee. The cost of storage in depleted gas fields is estimated, assuming either re-use of existing installations or the construction of new platforms and wells. Unit cost of storage, non-discounted, in the range of 10 (sic)/tCO(2) is feasible for larger fields; costs for small fields are estimated to range up to 40 (sic)/tCO(2). Constructing new, dedicated facilities is not always the more expensive option, due to sometimes long hibernation times and higher operational cost of existing facilities. Two capture scenarios are used for the Rotterdam and Amsterdam areas, with captured volumes increasing to 25 Mt/yr or 40 Mt/yr. In both cases, injection rate limitations become apparent when 70 - 75\% of the storage capacity is used, which is around 2055 and 2045, respectively. To ensure continuity of storage, alternatives for storage in offshore gas fields need to be in place by then. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Study and application of a new blockage remover in polymer injection wells
AB  - With the extensive application of polymer flooding technology in offshore oilfields, the plugging in polymer injection wells has become more and more severe, which seriously affects the oil displacement effect and regular production of oilfields. In this paper, a new kind of blockage remover has been developed and evaluated by rheological behavior experiments, dissolution experiments and core flooding experiments. The results reveal that this new blockage remover can effectively reduce the viscosity of polymer and completely degrade the reservoir blockage with low corrosion rate. It is beneficial to long-term production of oil wells in offshore oilfield. Results of core flooding experiments show that this new blockage remover can relieve polymer damage and improve permeability. The agent has been applied in LD10-1 oilfield in 2016, the daily injection rate increased significantly after stimulation. Â© 2018 Southwest Petroleum University

TI  - Multi-objective numerical optimization of the front blade pitch angle distribution in a counter-rotating type horizontal-axis tidal turbine
AB  - In order to exploit renewable energies from tidal stream, tandem propellers of a unique counter-rotating type horizontal-axis tidal turbine was firstly designed based on the blade element momentum (BEM) theory. And then a multi-objective numerical optimization method coupled the response surface method (RSM) with the genetic algorithm (GA) was employed to obtain desirable blade profiles. The front blade pitch angle distribution was taken as optimization variablein this paper, as it plays an important role in affecting the inlet conditions of the rear blade. The numerical results show that both optimization objectives of power coefficient and thrust coefficient can be significantly improved. It was verified that the performance of the power unit with the optimized blades increases obviously by optimizing the pitch angle. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Issues in OTEC commercialization
AB  - The commercialization of a new capital intensive technology requires coordination between government and industry. Government regulation of the energy industry can hinder its commercial development. On the other hand, government financial incentive is essential to induce industry to invest in a new technology such as OTEC. Incentives will be necessary in the early phases of development both for the manufacturers of OTEC systems and components and for the owner/operators of OTEC power plants. The various incentives are analyzed and their impact on manufacturers of, investors in, and users of OTEC technology is discussed. Analysis shows that OTEC is technically and economically ready to enter the electric utility market in tropical islands. For the larger U.S. mainland market, economies of scale are expected to reduce the capital cost to a low enough level where OTEC can be competitive. Â© 1980.

TI  - Settling flux and origin of particulate organic carbon in a macro-tidal semi-enclosed embayment: Luoyuan Bay, Southeast China coast
AB  - Coastal embayments play a vital role in the global carbon cycle either as sources of organic matter to open sea or as carbon sinks due to the accumulation of organic matter in sediments. This paper describes a study of Luoyuan Bay, a typical semi-enclosed embayment with a total area of approximately 227 km2 in a strong tidal environment. The analysed results indicate that the particulate organic carbon (POC) concentration in suspended particulate matter (SPM) varies from 0.57 mg/L to 1.33 mg/L at the bottom layer (0.5 MAB, meters above bed) and from 0.54 mg/L to 1.25 mg/L at the surface layer (0.5 MBS, meters below surface). The Î´13Câ€° ranges from âˆ’25.52â€° to âˆ’23.54â€° and exhibits different variations at the surface and bottom layers in spring and neap tides. The POC content in deposited particulate matter (DPM) varies from 0.62% to 2.95%, increasing from spring to neap tide, and the Î´13C and C/N molar ratio are âˆ’25.29â€° âˆ¼ âˆ’21.41â€° and 4.18â€“8.53, respectively. The settling fluxes of POC obtained by sediment trap decrease from 2.25 g/m2Â·tide during the spring tide to 0.55 g/m2Â·tide during the neap tide with a mean value of 1.41 g/m2Â·tide during the observation, whereas the settling flux of SPM decreases from 456.76 g/m2Â·tide during the spring tide to 37.12 g/m2Â·tide during the neap tide. Combining the Î´13C and C/N molar ratio, three end-members are recognized, i.e., freshwater algae and phytoplankton, marine algae and phytoplankton, and kelp-derived detritus. The mean contribution to POC from these three sources is 57.2%, 31.8% and 11.0% in SPM, and 39.9%, 35.0% and 25.1% in DPM, respectively. The POC from freshwater algae, phytoplankton and kelp-derived detritus is controlled by sediment dynamic processes. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - How Does the Accessibility of Floating Wind Farm Sites Compare to Existing Fixed Bottom Sites?
AB  - Offshore wind is poised for huge growth in the coming years, the UK government has set targets of 40 GW of offshore wind, including 1 GW of floating wind, to be installed in the UK by 2030. Many proposed wind development sites are in deeper waters, farther from shore and will therefore need to be developed as floating wind sites. Developing sites in deeper waters provides access to higher, more consistent wind speeds, however this also means increased wave heights and tougher operating conditions. This makes the challenge of site accessibility critical to the goal of lowering the costs of offshore wind. Accessibility is the amount of time that vessels can safely access a given site. The objective of this study was to make a comparison of the accessibility of potential future floating wind sites to existing fixed bottom wind farm sites. Accessibility was calculated by developing Matlab code using established techniques and definitions found in the literature. A case study was then completed using sites in Scottish waters proposed for development as part of the Scotwind leasing plan. The majority of the Scotwind sites will need to be developed as floating wind sites due to the large water depths. This study assesses the accessibility of the Scotwind leasing sites and compares them to a typical fixed bottom site. The study found that accessibility will be a greater challenge for floating farm wind sites compared to fixed bottom sites. Increased access to vessels that can operate in larger wave heights will likely be necessary to operate and maintain floating wind farm sites. Â© 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Current advancements towards the use of nanofluids in the reduction of CO2 emission to the atmosphere
AB  - Development of novel, efficient and cost-effective strategies to diminish the permanent emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere has been an indisputable concern for scientists. CO2 is known as the most prominent GHG, which its abnormal amount in the atmosphere accelerates the occurrence of unfavorable environmental events such as acid rain, ocean acidification, global warming, and soil degradation. Nowadays, application of various nanofluids for increasing separation efficiency of CO2 has been an attractive subject due to their certain privileges such as chemical compatibility and great specific area. This paper tries to provide an up-to-date overview of the commonly-employed nanofluids accompanying with their properties and applications to enhance the separation efficiency of CO2. Moreover, important mechanisms toward improving the mass transfer rate and the separation proficiency of CO2 through the nanofluids are comprehensively discussed and summarized. Single material nanofluids (SMNFs) and hybrid nanofluids (HNFs) are considered as major categorizations of commonly-employed nanofluids in the scientific scope of membrane-based gas separation process (MGSP), which are aimed to be discussed in this paper. True recognition of nanofluids application in the CO2 separation process leads to finding its advantages/disadvantages in comparison with other conventional procedures. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Linking Improvement of Soil Structure to Soil Carbon Storage Following Invasion by a C-4 Plant Spartina alterniflora
AB  - Coastal wetlands are increasingly recognized as important ecosystems for long-term carbon (C) storage. However, how soil aggregation mediates C accumulation and sequestration in these ecosystems remains unclear. Using the C-13 isotope tracer from the invasion of a C-4 plant, Spartina alterniflora, into the native ecosystem originally covered by C-3 plants across Eastern Chinese coastal wetlands, we investigated a potential C stabilization process via soil structural protection. We quantified changes in soil aggregates, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (STN), and natural C-13 isotope abundance within aggregate fractions across a chronosequence of 0-, 4-, 8-, and 12-year S. alterniflora invasion. Our results showed that soil aggregate stability increased significantly along the chronosequence. Meanwhile, SOC and STN concentrations increased with invasion time in the whole soil and aggregate fractions, which were linked to increasing soil aggregate stability. The contribution of S. alterniflora-derived SOC increased from 18.96 to 40.24\% in the 0-20cm layer and from 4.66 to 32.04\% in the 20-40cm layer across the chronosequence from 4 to 12years with the highest proportion observed in macro-aggregates. Our results indicate that invasion of S. alterniflora to coastal wetlands can sequester more C largely due to formation and stabilization of soil aggregates by soil structural protection.

TI  - Prospective direct use enterprises in Kapoho, Hawaii
AB  - The Puna District of the island of Hawaii encompasses the only Known Geothermal Resource Area (KGRA) in the State of Hawaii. Its Kapoho region is also the location of the state's sole geothermal power plant, the 30 MW Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) facility. Despite significant potential, there is negligible direct utilization of geothermal heat in Kapoho. Direct use development is primarily hampered by a lack of awareness regarding the availability of the resource and its benefits, and by the perceived cost of infrastructure. A regulatory framework for geothermal development has been established, although County regulations do not specifically address direct use. The resources potentially available to direct use enterprises in Puna include thermal groundwater from shallow wells and excess heat from PGV's operations. Water wells in the area with depths less than 230 meters (750 ft) have recorded temperatures ranging up to 89Â°C (193Â°F). PGV is supplied by several deep wells that have encountered fluids at temperatures up to 342Â°C (648Â°F). Hot brine from the separator, at approximately 204Â°C (400Â°F), could be tapped for direct use or additional power generation prior to reinjection. Economic activity in Kapoho is primarily based on agriculture. Direct use offers value-added opportunities for existing enterprises such as papaya farming, nursery operations and commercial fishing, and can also provide the basis for new businesses. Direct use opportunities are especially promising in Hawaii because of the exceptionally high costs of conventional energy supplies, and because they can improve profitability, add value to products, increase productivity and expand job opportunities in an environmentally benign manner.

TI  - An affordable and portable autonomous surface vehicle with obstacle avoidance for coastal ocean monitoring
AB  - Bathymetry measurements are needed in shallow, near-shore environments to estimate the potential distribution of macroalgae and seagrass, which contribute to oceanic carbon sinks in Greenland and other Arctic locations. Additionally, ocean current observations near icebergs and marine-terminating glaciers are necessary to estimate their melt rates. Rocky coastlines, icebergs and glaciers, however, present a significant safety risk to manned vessels. We developed an affordable and portable autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) that can safely obtain bathymetry and ocean current measurements in dangerous environments. The Arctic Research Centre Autonomous Boat (ARCAB) is a student-built ASV that can be transported on a euro-pallet and operated from a small boat and from shore. ARCAB has a minimum battery life of 2 h and accommodates a SonTek M9 RiverSurveyor system for bathymetry and ocean current measurements. ARCAB is controlled by a National Instruments myRIO-1900 and features autonomous waypoint navigation, obstacle avoidance, and return-to-home functionality. We demonstrate the use of ARCAB in Greenland in January 2019. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Prefabricated caissons for tidal power development.
AB  - In recent years, increasing use has been made of prefabricated concrete caissons for marine and underwater construction projects. Progress in these techniques has demonstrated the practability of their application for tidal power developments. The potential advantages in dependability, construction time, and cost can be particularly significant. There are, however, a number of requirements specific to tidal power schemes, and some practical limitations relating to construction of the barrages across estuaries, which must be accommodated if these advantages are to be realised. The nature and magnitude of such requirements and problems are discussed, and ways in which they may be tackled are indicated. Use of caissons at the La Rance and Kislaya Gubu tidal power stations and for the sluice at Volkerak in the Netherlands is described.

We are extremely sorry. Anyway, we hope the presented material will give the reader a first insight in the development process and motivation behind the first ever mono Air Supported Vessel (ASV) with pod propulsion (Volvo Penta IPS).

The vessel is extensively outfitted and instrumented for scientific data collection and proper evaluation of the new concept. Documentation of efficiency, performance and capabilities will be given the highest priority, and the data will be used to compare the new concept with current State of the Art conventional solutions. The estimates to be presented in this paper have been prepared by SSPA Sweden, Volvo Penta and Effect Ships International (ESI) and will indicate the expectations to the new vessel. The final proof will however await the delayed launch of the vessel and subsequent testing. Results will be presented at first possible RINA conference.

TI  - Deep ocean water as a resource for thermostatic control of microclimates for the maximization of natural energy production
AB  - Except for the energy associated with the rotation of the earth, natural energy flows on the planet derive from a thermodynamic process which involves the sun as solar radiator, the atmosphere and ocean as process fluids and the ground as heat source or sink. Thus the natural generation of energy product (water at high altitude, wind, biomass) through transfer of thermal energy to potential or chemical energy is limited by the efficiency of the Carnot cycle. This productivity limitation is also a limit in microclimates. It has been demonstrated that deep ocean water can be raised from the deep ocean to the surface with a net liberation of thermal energy. The deep ocean water which is used for cooling purposes in an energy cycle none the less leaves the heat exchanger at a reduced temperature and is thus available for other thermal energy uses. A preliminary examination of the use of deep ocean water on the basis of experiments that only obliquely examined this hypothesis reveals that the natural energy productivity of a coastal desert can be increased by factors of five or more and the natural productivity of a high island can be increased by factors of two or more. The experiments associated with the production of strawberries, lettuce, and alstroemeria are used as examples. In addition, experiments in air conditioning and the use of the water as an industrial process chiller are also described. Speculations as to a systematic approach to the use of deep ocean water as a thermostatic microclimate regulator are made.

TI  - Large-scale model tests of a single pile and two-pile groups for an offshore platform in sand
AB  - Estimating pile group efficiency for open-ended steel piles in small group arrangements is a challenging task for designers. This paper reports on the large-scale experimental campaign performed for the BorWin gamma offshore converter platform, which involved single piles and two-pile group systems on a scale of 1:10. The experimental works included installation, dynamic end-of-driving tests, dynamic restrike tests, and static load tests of a single pile and a pair of two-pile groups in densely compacted, artificially prepared homogeneous sand. The cone penetration test (CPT) profiles and the blow counts confirmed that the foundation systems are comparable to each other. The experimental results of the single pile system were compared with conventional design methods. Such comparison indicated that CPT-based methods and load-transfer methods are applicable at the considered model scale. The bearing capacity prediction obtained via the Case Pile Wave Analysis Program (CAPWAP) method is conservative with respect to the static capacity. A consistent setup effect can be detected by analyzing the complete dynamic loading session. The pile group efficiency for the given foundation system was found to be less than 1.0 at both very small and very large soil strains, while it equaled 1.0 at failure.

TI  - Capillary tubing advancements for enhanced production and reduced environmental impact - A case history review
AB  - Over the past several years the industry has seen significant technology advancements that have supported the new innovative applications for "Capillary Tubing Systems" from basic onshore chemical injection installations to more complex offshore applications. These innovative applications continuously challenge and redefine the boundaries of conventional well intervention methodology. Well interventions in any economically challenging environment can sometimes be difficult to justify. Capillary tubing systems have recently been deployed on challenging new projects in Asia Pacific, Europe and the USA to provide operators with an alternative cost effective method to maintain well bore integrity and enhance production. Typical capillary tubing sizes are 1/4, 3/8, 5/8 and 3/4-inch OD. Capillary tubing systems have three primary applications and functions. The first being semi-permanent installations for the continuous injection of chemicals down hole for production enhancement. Capillary enables effective and cost-efficient delivery of production or stimulation chemicals at precise downhole depths while maintaining full ESD (emergency shutdown) and sub-surface safety valve (SCSSV) functionality. Secondly for reactivating wells that have been shut in due to the loss of SSSV control line integrity. The third being a wide range of work string activities similar to those performed by conventional "Big Coil" units such as: - Scale Removal with Acids - Solids Removal - Gas Lifting - Paraffin Removal with Chemicals - Cementing - Hydrate Removal - Logging Tool Deployment - Perforating A typical capillary equipment package (Figures: 1 and 2) is comparable to but much smaller than a standard coiled tubing spread with a substantially reduced cost, environmental impact and risk exposure. The small light weight foot print is especially beneficial in conditions with crane or deck space limitations. Capillary equipment can be custom designed to suit most land or offshore applications. Capillary tubing can be installed on a semi-permanent basis or deployed as a work-string for well intervention programs. A specially designed SSSV system can enable capillary installation in wells with existing SSSV systems. Installations or well interventions can be safely performed in a matter of hours in most situations. New and innovative capillary technologies allow the equipment to be applied to a broader spectrum of well servicing applications. This has the potential for substantial reductions in operating cost, logistical support and risk exposure that can be applied to operating environments worldwide both onshore and offshore. Wells that were once considered plug and abandon candidates due to cost, technical challenges or accessibility may now be candidates for capillary technology solutions.

AB  - Due to influence of wind, wave, current and other environmental loads, there is large movement of the platform supporting the offshore floating wind turbine which is often in yaw working state, and results in a significant impact on the aerodynamic load and output power of the wind turbine. Based on potential flow and blade element momentum theories, a coupled model of aero-elasticity and hydrodynamics of offshore floating wind turbine is established to analyze the output power and blade load of the wind turbine under the combined actions of turbulent wind and irregular waves. It is found that when the wind turbine yaw is 30 degrees under the rated wind speed condition, the average output power is reduced by 21.8% and the average flap moment on the blade root decreases by 28.58% compared with yaw of zero degree. Output power of the wind turbine can be enhanced by suppressing surge and pitch of the platform. Â© 2022, Editorial Office of Ship Building of China. All right reserved.

TI  - Economic Feasibility of Wave Energy Farms in Portugal
AB  - This paper develops a methodology to determine the economic feasibility of implementing offshore wave energy farms on the Portuguese continental coast. This methodology follows several phases: the geographic phase, the energy phase, the economic phase, and the restrictions phase. First, in the geographic phase, the height and the period of the waves, the bathymetry, the distance from the farm to the shore, from farm to shipyard, and from farm to port, are calculated. In the energy phase the energy produced by each wave energy converter is determined, and in the economic phase, the parameters calculated in the previous phases are used as input to find the economic parameters. Finally, in the restrictions phase, a limitation by the bathymetry will be added to the economic maps, whose value will be different depending on the floating offshore wave energy converter (WEC). In this study, three wave energy converters have been considered, Pelamis, AquaBuOY, and Wave Dragon, and several scenarios for electric tariffs have been taken into account. The results obtained indicate what the best WEC is for this study in terms of its levelized cost of energy (LCOE), internal rate of return (IRR), and net present value (NPV), and where the best area is to install wave energy farms.

TI  - Operational data-driven energy performance assessment of ships: the case study of a naval vessel with hybrid propulsion
AB  - Ship designers hardly ever receive feedback from the actual operation of their designs apart from sea acceptance trials. Similarly, crews operating the vessels do not receive a clear picture of the energy performance and environmental footprint of different options. This paper proposes a methodology based on operational data from continuous monitoring, and applies it to an ocean patrol vessel of the Royal Netherlands Navy in order to identify the impact of diverse operational conditions on energy performance over the whole operating range, but also to examine the decision to equip the vessel with hybrid propulsion. Specifically, it introduces mean energy effectiveness indicator and mean total energy efficiency over discretised vessel speed, as the main tool in quantifying the energy gains and losses to assist in making better-advised design and operational decisions. Moreover, it demonstrates a dataset enrichment procedure, using manufacturers' information, in case not all needed sensors are available. Results suggest that electrical propulsion was 15-25\% less efficient than the best mechanical propulsion mode, and on the overall energy performance of the vessel, increasing speed by 1 knot caused a 7\% and 14\% increase over the minimum CO2/mile emissions between 8 and 14, and above 14 knots respectively.

TI  - Feasibility study of mooring lines design for a floating tidal turbine platform using double hull structure
AB  - The aim of this paper is to study the mooring tension characteristics on a tidal energy converter (TIC) platform considering i) a horizontal and ii) a vertical tidal turbine. The study examines numerically the feasibility of a catenary mooring line for a modular tidal energy platform. A modular platform is designed and modelled with two floating hulls and anchored by studlink catenary mooring chains on the seabed. Vertical and horizontal axis turbines which have similar Cp are selected and modelled separately. The effect of those turbines on the mooring system are compared and the results informs lifetime of the mooring component for each turbine connection. The hydrodynamic model with no turbine is firstly developed and validated against an experiment with 1:12 scale ratio. The starboard fore mooring line tension, platform surge and pitch displacements are validated against the experiment. The model results show identical signal frequency with slightly different magnitude from the experiment. The mooring tension under vertical and horizontal tidal turbine operations in the particular environment is further examined. The result shows that the mooring line using selected vertical axis turbine experiences higher tension. For platform motions, the horizontal turbine generates slightly larger displacement in surge. However the pitch motion record shows equal displacement under both turbine operations. The selected vertical axis tidal turbine also produces longer lifetime mooring components.

TI  - Historical Data Reveal 30-Year Persistence of Benthic Fauna Associations in Heavily Modified Waterbody
AB  - Baseline surveys form the cornerstone of coastal impact studies where altered conditions, for example through new infrastructure development, are assessed against a temporal reference state. They are snapshots taken before construction. Due to scarcity of relevant data prior to baseline surveys long-term trends can often not be taken into account. Particularly in heavily modified waterbodies this would however be desirable to control for changes in anthropogenic use over time as well as natural ecological variation. Here, the benthic environment of an industrialized embayment was investigated (Swansea Bay, Wales, UK) where it is proposed to build a tidal lagoon that would generate marine renewable energy from the tidal range. Since robust long-term baseline data was not available, the value of unpublished historical benthos information from 1984 by a regional water company was assessed with the aim to improve certainty about the persistence of current benthic community patterns. A survey of 101 positions in 2014 identified spatially discrete benthic communities with areas of high and low diversity. Habitat characteristics including sediment properties and the proximity to a sewage outfall explained 17-35\% of the variation in the community structure. Comparing the historical information from 1984 with 2014 revealed striking similarity in the benthic communities between those years, not just in their spatial distribution but also to a large extent in the species composition. The 30-year-old information confirmed spatial boundaries of discrete species associations and pinpointed a similar diversity hotspot. A group of five common species was found to be particularly persistent over time (Nucula nitidosa, Spisula elliptica, Spiophanes bombyx, Nephtys hombergii, Diastylis rathkei). According to the Infauna Quality Index (IQI) linked to the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) the average ecological status for 2014 was ``moderate,{''} but 11 samples showing ``poor{''} and ``bad{''} status indicated possible negative impacts of dredge spoil disposal. Generally the study demonstrated the value of historical information for assessing the persistence of benthic community characteristics, while also highlighting shortcomings if raw data is lost and if the historical baseline does not reflect pristine ecological conditions.

TI  - The supervision and multi-sectoral guarantee mechanism of the global marine sulphur limit-assessment from Chinese shipping industry
AB  - To significantly reduce sulfur oxides emissions from fossil fuel-powered ships, reduce air pollution in ports and slow ocean acidification, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has imposed the new 0.50\%m/m limit (reduced from 3.50\%m/m in the past) on sulphur in ships' fuel oil. This has given rise to a host of issues regarding fuel replenishment operations, safe operation management, maritime regulation, and coordinated governance of air and climate. In response to ocean acidification and climate change, regulations on the use of low-sulfur oil or alternative fuels by ships greatly reduce sulfur oxide emissions, but have no significant impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, the refining process for low-sulfur fuels and the use of the gas cleaning system on ships both increase energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. To ensure the decarbonization process of shipping industry, there is an urgent need for a conceptual change in global ocean governance so as to promote the coordinated governance of air pollution and climate change. China's conception of ``a maritime community with a shared future{''} provides a new model for global ocean governance. The Chinese government has formulated regulations at different levels to promote the coordinated management of atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. Regarding supervision of sulfur oxide emissions from ships, this study proposes to build a multi-department collaborative supervision mechanism from marine fuel life cycle to enhance sulfur oxide monitoring and risk control capabilities. Specific measures of the proposed supervision mechanism include: the joint supervision of compliant fuel supply, the compliant fuel information disclosure platform, a joint law enforcement mechanism for atmospheric pollution, the ability of intelligent ship exhaust monitoring, and the construction of port power infrastructure.

TI  - OCEAN BASED SOLAR-TO-HYDROGEN ENERGY CONVERSION MACRO SYSTEM.
AB  - This paper is an attempt at an initial conceptualization of an ocean based solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion facility. It is proposed to use hydrogen as an energy carrier to be delivered to the spectrum of energy-using sectors, instead of electricity, because of hydrogen's advantages of transportability and storability. These make hydrogen and solar energy natural adjuncts. It is further proposed that the solar-to-hydrogen conversion process be conducted on the open ocean, and not in the traditional desert location.

TI  - Two-magnet energy harvesting device for charging submersable sensors
AB  - Monitoring subsea environment requires sophisticated tools such as Autonomous or Remote Underwater Vehicles, submersible sensors, and very skilled manpower. Power is vital to the success of subsea missions especially in deep-waters where visibility is poor and the travel time from the surface to the seabed and vice versa takes a relatively long time. Therefore, renewable energy sources have been tapped into as a solution to continuously provide power to underwater vehicles, actuators, and sensors used/located in deep waters, such as the Gulf of Mexico or the North Sea. Previously, we designed a one-magnet energy harvester installed at the bottom of the sea to generate electricity for small sensors. In order to increase the electrical power production to provide power for a variety of devices, two kinds of energy harvesters (single-magnet and two-magnet) actuated via a buoy are proposed here. The produced voltage is fed to a signal conditioning rectifier to prep it for usage by sensors/actuators. The performance of the two proposed harvesters using the Genetic Algorithms generated parameter is presented for comparison. The simulation results showed that the electrical power generated by the two-magnet energy harvester using periodic wave motion is double that of the single-magnet energy harvester.

TI  - Determination of the Response Amplitude Operator of a tidal turbine as a spectral transfer function
AB  - A transfer function determination method is proposed in this study to predict the unsteady fluctuations of the performance of a tidal turbine model. This method is derived from the Response Amplitude Operator (RAO) applied in the offshore industry to predict linear wave-induced loads on large structures. It is based on a spectral approach and requires the acquisition of a turbine parameter (e.g. torque, thrust, power or root-blade force) in synchronization with an upstream flow velocity measurement. On the frequency range where the causality between these two signals is proven, the transfer function is established using the ratio between the cross-spectral density and the spectral density of the incoming velocity. The linearity is verified using the coherence function, which shows validity for the turbine power in the lowest frequencies only. This transfer function is then used to reconstruct the power fluctuations which is compared to the recorded one for a particular flow condition with bathymetry generated turbulence. The result shows the dependence on the accurate location of the velocity measurement point used for the reconstruction. This point must exactly correspond to the expected turbine location, i.e. where the turbine response needs to be processed. Bearing in mind its limits, the method can be used to predict the loadings of extreme events on the turbine structure and the performance variations corresponding to the unsteady characteristics of a turbulent flow, for a better grid integration.

TI  - Conditions and costs for renewables electricity grid connection: Examples in Europe
AB  - This paper compares conditions and costs for RES-E grid connection in selected European countries. These are Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Austria, Lithuania and Slovenia. Country specific case studies are presented for wind onshore and offshore, biomass and photovoltaic power systems, as based on literature reviews and stakeholder interviews. It is shown that, especially for wind offshore, the allocation of grid connection costs can form a significant barrier for the installation of new RES-E generation if the developer has to bear all such costs. If energy policy makers want to reduce the barriers for new large-scale RES-E deployment, then it is concluded that the grid connection costs should be covered by the respective grid operator. These costs may then be recouped by increasing consumer tariffs for the use of the grid. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evolution of the Seismic Response of Monopile-Supported Offshore Wind Turbines of Increasing Size from 5 to 15 MW including Dynamic Soil-Structure Interaction
AB  - As a result of wind power's expansion over the globe, offshore wind turbines (OWTs) are being projected in seismic prone areas. In parallel, the industry develops increasingly larger and more powerful generators. Many of the seismic response analyses of wind turbines conducted so far only consider smaller units. In this paper, a finite element substructuring model in frequency domain is used to compute the seismic response of four reference OWTs from 5 to 15 MW founded on monopiles embedded in several homogeneous soil profiles with shear wave velocities from 100 to 300 m/s and subjected to different accelerograms. The foundation behaviour is obtained through a continuum model including kinematic and inertial interaction. The relevance of soil-structure interaction and main trends of the seismic response of OWTs are inferred from the presented results. Although the seismic maximum bending moments increase with the size of the OWT system, their relevance with respect to the ones produced by design loads decreases as the turbine gets bigger. The same effect is observed for the shear forces if the soil is soft enough. The inclusion of SSI effects almost duplicates the seismic response when compared to the rigid base scenario.

TI  - Composites in wind energy
AB  - Two countries, Ireland and the USA feature in this report on the use of composites in wind energy projects. The Irish project is the country's first offshore wind power installation, situated ten miles from shore near the seaside town of Arklow. The project has three 3.6 megawatt turbines, a world first for this level of energy output (above 3 megawatts). The technology was a cooperative development by Airtricity of Ireland and GE Wind Energy of the USA. The use of wind power is spreading across the USA as wind energy costs go lower than those for gas energy. By the end of the year 2003 one forecast is that 1600 megawatts of wind power capacity will be added to existing energy sources in the USA. In Texas alone 300 megawatts of capacity will be added by the end of the year.

TI  - Design optimization of dynamic inter-array cable systems for floating offshore wind turbines
AB  - Despite its huge potential, floating offshore wind technology has not reached commercial maturity yet and numerous problems remain to be investigated. A major knowledge gap exists regarding the dynamic behavior of the freely moving inter-array cables, that link the floating turbines. This work presents a design approach based on a genetic algorithm. No publications on this topic were done before. The hybrid MATLAB-OrcaFlex tool considers fatigue life, performance in extreme weather events and economic evaluation criteria. Starting point for the dynamic analysis are cable configurations from hydrostatic optimization. Based on this hydrostatic optimization, a general design rule for lazy wave cables can be deduced in the depth range from 70 to 200 m. To the best knowledge of the authors, such a generalized design recommendation is unique in literature. The methodology and peculiarities of the fatigue life assessment are discussed. Recommendable parameters for the algorithm and the simulations are presented. The optimization tool is applied on a case study with the OC4-DeepCwind model located at Portugal's Agucadoura test site. In a parametric study, water depth and cable orientation are varied.

TI  - Impact of climate change on dynamic behavior of offshore wind turbine
AB  - Global warming is expected to change the wind and wave patterns at a significant level, which may lead to conditions outside current design criteria of monopile supported offshore wind turbine (OWT). This study examines the impact of climate change on the dynamic behavior and future safety of an OWT founded in clay incorporating dynamic soil-structure interaction. A statistical downscaling model is used to generate the time series of future wind speed and wave height at local level. The responses and fatigue life of OWT are estimated for present and future periods and extent of change in design is investigated at offshore location along the west coast of India. Wind speed, wave height, and wave period data are collected from the buoy deployed by Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services and the future climate for the next 30 years is simulated using the general circulation model corresponding to Special Report on Emission Scenarios A1B scenario. The OWT is modeled as Euler-Bernoulli beam and soil-structure interaction is incorporated using nonlinear p-y springs. This study shows that changes in design of OWT are needed due to increased responses owing to the effect of climate change. Fatigue life is found to be decreased because of climate change.

TI  - Study on shape design and power performance analysis of small horizontal axis tidal turbine with duct using BEM and CFD methods
AB  - In this study, a horizontal-axis tidal turbine using a duct was designed to secure a relatively high annual energy production(AEP). Based on a rated flow velocity of 2m/s, the blade shape design was conducted by applying the BEM theory and the shape optimization of the duct using the HEEDs was completed. In order to compare the power performance of the duct-type tidal turbine, a steady state CFD analysis using STAR-CCM was performed. For the results, 5.4kW of electrical power was generated at the rated flow velocity, and the maximum efficiency was shown as a 45% at 1.6 m/s condition. It has been confirmed that the power curve uses stall controlled characteristics to protect the turbine under the condition of high flow velocity region. Additionally, the annual energy production can be improved to 9% under certain conditions because of the effect of flow velocity enhancement. Â© 2018 The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - Mangrove forests are a unique coastal ecosystem with trees adapted to a constantly fluctuating and sometimes extreme physical environment. Mangrove forests provide important ecosystem services that benefit local people and all of us in terms of climate regulation through the storage of greenhouse gasses in biomass. This research reports carbon stock, wood volume, tree density, and biodiversity indices for two mangrove forest areas in Langsa City Regency, Aceh Province, Indonesia. The two sites represent and inland area and an ocean-exposed area within a large mangrove forest ecosystem complex. The results of the analysis show that these two tracts are quite similar in terms of carbon stock and biodiversity even though they occupy different locations within the larger tract of mangrove habitat. The study confirms these are healthy forest areas with relatively high carbon stocks. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - MMC Based MTDC Grids: A Detailed Review on Issues and Challenges for Operation, Control and Protection Schemes
AB  - For decades high voltage alternating current (HVAC) was considered as most economical solution to transmit and deliver electric power. With the recent developments in power electronic devices, high voltage direct current (HVDC) system becomes most prominent technology. Multi-terminal direct current (MTDC) based system as a promising technology for future power system is the major focus area for researchers and industries these days. A number of MTDC systems have been implemented physically. The major motivation to construct such MTDC systems is the integration of large-scale offshore power sources such as wind turbines and solar systems. This article discusses the most critical challenges and issues related to operation, control and protection schemes for integration of modular multi-level converter (MMC) based MTDC systems. At first detailed literature survey has been presented to show the challenges for MMC based MTDC systems, then an analysis related to those challenges for operation, control and protection schemes for existing MMC based MTDC systems has been provided. Finally, a road map to tackle such challenges has been suggested.

TI  - Climate change mitigation of drop-in biofuels for deep-sea shipping under a prospective life-cycle assessment
AB  - The shipping sector is seeking options to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and achieve ambitious climate change mitigation goals. Unlike short-sea shipping that can rely on electrification of coastal vessels, drop-in biofuels are among the most promising options for deep-sea shipping decarbonization. However, environmental sustainability analyses of marine biofuels are limited, and usually do not include the influence of future changes in the background energy system nor the climatic effects of near-term climate forcers (NTCFs). In our study, we assess the climate change mitigation potential of various marine biofuels produced from forest residues in Norway (a country with ambitious plans for emission reduction from shipping) using a prospective life-cycle assessment (LCA) where the projected trends in the energy and transport sectors are integrated with improvements in the biofuel value chain for the next decades (2030-2050). Relative to fossil-based alternatives, climate mitigation potentials of biofuels range from 65\% to 85\% with short-term (GWP20) and to 78\%-87\% with long-term (GTP100) climate impacts. The inclusion of NTCFs reduces the mitigation benefits of biofuels in the short term, while it slightly increases them in the long term. The explicit modeling of technology and socio-economic changes under future policy scenarios indicates a reduction in the climate impacts of biofuels by up to 54\% in 2050 when compared to the current situation. The amount of residues potentially available in Norway is sufficient to meet the present demand for liquid fuels in deep-sea shipping, thus providing yearly climate mitigation of 0.9-1.1 million tons of CO2-eq (equal to 6-7\% of today's climate impacts from the entire transport sector in the country). Our analysis shows the large climate change mitigation potential of drop-in biofuels, and it provides new quantitative estimates that can help guiding a sustainability shift in the deep-sea shipping sector.

TI  - Soil sealing by algae: An alternative to plastic pond liners for outdoor algal cultivation
AB  - Commercial production of algal biofuels is currently limited by high capital costs, particularly costs of synthetic pond liners that minimize seepage of cultivation fluids, salts, and nutrients into the subsurface beneath outdoor algae cultivation facilities. Even some profitable nutraceutical companies bear the high costs of pond liners. However, studies of animal waste holding ponds and aquaculture facilities have shown that underlying soils can effectively ``self-seal{''}, potentially eliminating the need for plastic liners. Here, we explored the potential for self-sealing with algae to provide an alternative to synthetic pond liners in unlined algae cultivation ponds. Laboratory-scale soil column experiments were used to investigate soil clogging by algae, a topic rarely discussed in the literature. Columns composed of fine sand, loamy sand, and loam soil displayed reductions in saturated hydraulic conductivity of the entire soil column of up to two orders of magnitude in response to infiltration by the alga Scenedesmus dimorphus suspended in algal culture nutrient solution at a density of 5 x 10(8) cells L-1 Scanning electron microscope imaging showed a dense algal layer on the surface of each soil column, thickly coating mineral grains with algal material and filling pore spaces. The algal coating was absent in samples at > 3 cm depth in the soil columns, and measurements of chlorophyll content also confirmed that algal cells were mostly confined to the soil surface. In this study, the application of an algal suspension contributed significantly to soil sealing. This new application of biological sealing technology should be studied further to determine its utility and durability as an alternative to plastic liners, perhaps in conjunction with soil compaction to achieve hydraulic conductivities beneath algal production ponds that are protective of groundwater quality.

TI  - Assessing Global-Scale Synergy Between Adaptation, Mitigation, and Sustainable Development for Projected Climate Change
AB  - The theoretical idea of a â€œgreenhouse effectâ€ hasÂ existed for centuries; however, the human influence via greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is realized post-mid-twentieth century. The resultant â€“ â€œglobal warmingâ€ â€“ has been evidently observed in causing intensified hydrological cycle and recurrent extreme climatic events. Consequently, unprecedented rise in glacier melting at a rate of 3.5â€“4.1% per decade, ocean warming due to &amp;gt;90% energy accumulation, ocean acidification due to falling in pH by 0.1, and mean sea-level rise of ~19Â cm due to aforesaid changes are observed globally, which are further endangering associated livelihoods, ecosystem, biodiversity, and coastal environment. This studyÂ evaluates key drivers of long-term future climate change, risk, and impacts at a global scale. The GCM data (a subset of the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble snapshot) has been used, comprising monthly means of climate variables from 1850 to 2100. The assessment is conducted considering two distinct future periods (2046â€“2065 and 2081â€“2100) under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 scenarios. Major findings indicated irreversible and pervasive impacts of continued GHG emission across all components of the climate system. As projected climate change will largely be driven by CO2 emissions, mere reduction of GHGs to zero will not prevent climate change during and post-twenty-first century. To combat future climate change, substantial and sustained GHG reductions by exploiting co-benefits of adaptation and mitigation are needed. The findings presented here can be useful for decision-making, climate policy drafting, and decentralized governance for enhancing mitigation shifts and adaptive capacity across all spatial scales.

TI  - Comparative experimental study of the survivability of a combined wind and wave energy converter in two testing facilities
AB  - Combining the offshore wind and wave energy on an integrated structure or in a farm configuration is beneficial for cost reduction since they could share the infrastructure and the ocean space. The spar torus combination (STC) is a combined wind and wave energy converter concept, which is composed of a spar floating wind turbine and a torus-shape heaving-body wave energy converter (WEC). Numerical simulations have shown a positive synergy between the WEC and the spar floating wind turbine under operational conditions. However, in extreme sea states, it is challenging to maintain structural integrity due to severe wave loads. Three survival modes have been proposed to study the survivability of the STC, and two of them are selected for further study by model testing. Two model tests were performed to investigate the performance of the STC under the two survival modes in extreme conditions: one test is carried out in the CNR-INSEAN towing tank, and the other one is performed in the MARINTEK towing tank. The two survival modes considered are when the torus is fixed to the spar at the mean water level (the MWL mode) and when the torus is fixed to the spar at a submerged position (the SUB mode). In this paper, the two model tests are described and then the measured responses in the two model tests are compared for each survival mode. In addition, the performance of the STC in the two survival modes for each model test is also compared. The differences in the two model tests are explained in detail. The focus of the model tests was wave-induced loads and responses, and wind was also included to model the mean wind thrust on the wind turbine rotor. In the model tests, the rigid body motions in six degree of freedom, the mooring line tensions, and the forces between the spar and torus in three directions (X, Y and Z) were measured. Finally, validation of a numerical model against the model test measurements is also briefly discussed. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved .

TI  - Composite Material Recycling Technology-State-of-the-Art and Sustainable Development for the 2020s
AB  - Recently, significant events took place that added immensely to the sociotechnical pressure for developing sustainable composite recycling solutions, namely (1) a ban on composite landfilling in Germany in 2009, (2) the first major wave of composite wind turbines reaching their End-of-Life (EoL) and being decommissioned in 2019-2020, (3) the acceleration of aircraft decommissioning due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and (4) the increase of composites in mass production cars, thanks to the development of high volume technologies based on thermoplastic composites. Such sociotechnical pressure will only grow in the upcoming decade of 2020s as other countries are to follow Germany by limiting and banning landfill options, and by the ever-growing number of expired composites EoL waste. The recycling of fiber reinforced composite materials will therefore play an important role in the future, in particular for the wind energy, but also for aerospace, automotive, construction and marine sectors to reduce environmental impacts and to meet the demand. The scope of this manuscript is a clear and condensed yet full state-of-the-art overview of the available recycling technologies for fiber reinforced composites of both low and high Technology Readiness Levels (TRL). TRL is a framework that has been used in many variations across industries to provide a measurement of technology maturity from idea generation (basic principles) to commercialization. In other words, this work should be treated as a technology review providing guidelines for the sustainable development of the industry that will benefit the society. The authors propose that one of the key aspects for the development of sustainable recycling technology is to identify the optimal recycling methods for different types of fiber reinforced composites. Why is that the case can be answered with a simple price comparison of E-glass fibers (similar to 2 \$/kg) versus a typical carbon fiber on the market (similar to 20 \$/kg)-which of the two is more valuable to recover? However, the answer is more complicated than that-the glass fiber constitutes about 90\% of the modern reinforcement market, and it is clear that different technologies are needed. Therefore, this work aims to provide clear guidelines for economically and environmentally sustainable End-of-Life (EoL) solutions and development of the fiber reinforced composite material recycling.

TI  - Modelling the impact of tidal range energy on species communities
AB  - Tidal energy has the potential to form a key component of the energy production in a number of countries, including the UK. Nonetheless, the deployment of tidal energy systems is associated with potential environmental impacts as prime resource sites often coincide with unique ecosystems inhabited by sensitive organisms. Previous studies have generally focused on the hydrodynamic impact of tidal energy schemes, i.e. how schemes alter the flow dynamics and sedimentary transport processes. Whilst these efforts are key in understanding environmental impacts, there is no straightforward step for translating sediment to faunal changes. Species distribution models offer methods to quantitatively predict certain possible impacts of tidal energy extraction. The River Severn is a distinguished candidate region for tidal energy in the UK featuring sites under stringent ecological protection regulations. We examine the impact of a proposed Severn tidal barrage on 14 species via the linking of hydrodynamic modelling to species distribution models. Through a selection of species that are linked via a simple food web system we extrapolate changes in prey species to the respective predator species. We show that species at lower trophic levels would be adversely affected by the barrage, but higher trophic level organisms increase in possible habitable area. Once food web relationships are acknowledged this increase in habitat area decreases, but is still net positive. Overall, all 14 species were affected, with most gaining in distribution area, and only four losing distribution area within the Severn Estuary. We conclude that a large-scale tidal barrage may have detrimental and complex impacts on species distribution, altering food web dynamics and altering food availability in the Severn Estuary. The methodology outlined herein can be transferred to the assessment and optimisation of prospective projects globally to aide in the sustainable introduction of the technology. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Modelling and optimisation of a hybrid PV-wind turbine-pumped hydro storage energy system for mini-grid application in coastline communities
AB  - This study proposes a clean, reliable and affordable hybrid energy conversion technology that is based on sunlight and wind, with a hydro based energy storage system. The proposed system comprises Photovoltaic arrays, wind turbine (WT) and Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES). The study was focused on satisfying energy demand of a typical coastline community, Patani (Lat. 5.23 degrees N and Long. 6.17 degrees E) - a Local Government Area (LGA). Genetic algorithm was adopted to optimise the PHES of the proposed hybrid plant to minimise the difference between energy demand and energy generated. Economic models were developed to ascertain the economic feasibility of the hybrid plant. High fidelity software (HOMER (R), MATLAB (R) and MS Excel (R) spreadsheet) were utilised for the analysis and optimisation. The peak rated power of PV and WT required to satisfy the energy demand of the LGA are 217 kW(p) and 226050 kW, respectively. The minimum storage capacity of the PHES was estimated at about 3,930,615 kWh, with the upper reservoir volume of 43170.06 m(3). The value of 0.27 \$/kWh was obtained for the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE); while the loss of load probability of the proposed energy system was estimated at 0.1086. The proposed energy system supports the Sustainable Development Goal 7 - affordable and clean energy, with climate change mitigation potential. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Global nitrogen deposition and carbon sinks
AB  - Land and ocean uptake of carbon dioxide plays a critical role in determining atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Future increases in nitrogen deposition have been predicted to increase the size of these terrestrial and marine carbon sinks, but although higher rates of nitrogen deposition might enhance carbon uptake in northern and tropical forests, they will probably have less of an impact on ocean sink strength. Combined, the land and ocean sinks may sequester an additional 10\% of anthropogenic cabon emissions by 2030 owing to increased nitrogen inputs, but a more conservative estimate of 1 to 2\% is more likely. Thus nitrogen-induced increases in the strength of land and ocean sinks are unlikely to keep pace with future increases in carbon dioxide.

TI  - Upper bound solution of the horizontal bearing capacity of a composite bucket shallow foundation in sand
AB  - The composite bucket shallow foundation that is proposed by Tianjin University can be better adapted to the offshore soft geological conditions in China for wind power engineering. Wind loading that directly determines the power generation efficiency of wind turbines, waves, currents and ice loading caused by a complex environment directly determines the horizontal displacement of the foundation. Therefore, calculating the horizontal bearing capacity is an important part of the design for the composite bucket shallow foundation. According to the numerical simulation, the failure surface of the soil is formed from the bottom of the rear wall of the bucket foundation, underneath the bucket foundation, to the front of the bucket foundation. Considering the different degrees of bucket foundation constraints on the inner soil, the horizontal soil damage rate is specified as a new empirical parameter in the formula, indicating the range of soil failure inside the bucket under horizontal loading. Upper bound solution of the horizontal bearing capacity of a composite bucket shallow foundation is derived in sand. Â© 2019 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).

TI  - Numerical and thermodynamic study on effects of high and low pressure exhaust gas recirculation on turbocharged marine low-speed engine
AB  - Marine low-speed engines are one of the most favorable power devices for oceangoing vessels. However, their energy consumption reduction is currently limited because of applying the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) to reduce the NOx emission. Consequently, high pressure (HP) and low pressure (LP) EGR are studied in this study to explore the interactive relationship among the EGR, the turbocharger and the engine. The HP EGR reduces the turbine power, causing the deterioration of scavenge air pressure and compressor surge margin. As a solution, the cylinder bypass rate should be kept approximately equivalent to the EGR rate. Moreover, to avoid unfavorable impacts on the NOx emission, it should be decoupled with the exhaust gas receiver. While, the LP EGR has opposite effects on the turbocharger: the turbine power is raised and compressor operating points move to the opposite direction. It could be preliminarily attributed to the better utilization of the increased exhaust gas temperature. From a thermodynamic analysis, the fundamental reason is the difference of compressor inlet composition. Demands of them for the compressor are concluded subsequently: the HP EGR requires a wide high efficiency area at a constant pressure ratio, while the LP EGR needs the high efficiency area as long as possible in its demand direction. Finally, detailed comparisons between them are conducted based on the re-matched turbochargers and optimized engine parameters: the control and the structure of LP EGR are simpler and more effective, but its cost and compactness are inferior to the HP EGR.

TI  - Deliberating enhanced weathering: Public frames, iconic ecosystems and the governance of carbon removal at scale
AB  - Meeting goals for `net zero' emissions may require the removal of previously emitted carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. One proposal, enhanced rock weathering, aims to speed up the weathering processes of rocks by crushing them finely and spreading them on agricultural land. Public perceptions of enhanced rock weathering and its wider social and environmental implications will be a critical factor determining its potential; we use six 2-day deliberative workshops in England, Wales and Illinois to understand public views. Consideration of enhanced rock weathering deployment in tropical countries led participants to frame it from a social justice perspective, which had been much less prevalent when considering Western agricultural contexts, and generated assumptions of increased scale, which heightened concerns about detrimental social and environmental impacts. Risk perceptions relating to `messing with nature' became amplified when participants considered enhanced rock weathering in relation to `iconic' environments such as the oceans and rainforest.

AB  - Because of the energy supply of the offshore oil platforms mainly relies on the supply of gas turbine, the development of renewable energy will become a rich energy supply for offshore oil platforms and a reliable way to improve the stability of the grid of the platforms. This paper developed the simulation model of offshore oil gas turbine platform power grid, simulated the hybrid power grid structure, the energy storage of frequency regulation, high wind power penetration rate, wind power and gas turbine power frequency stability and fault treatment. The method of increasing renewable energy penetration rate was proposed, and the hybrid energy coordinated control strategy of offshore oil platform was also carried out.

TI  - The importance of elemental sulphur, mercury and condensate identification in sour gas field development project: Case study
AB  - The deposition of elemental sulfur has a potential economic risk in gas field production, especially during the early development stage; however, at an advance stage of the field production life cycle, when elemental sulfur is finally deposited, it creates a serious concern during production as it can result in various significant safety, operational, corrosion and integrity problems. Sulfur solubility in gas wells can be affected by a number of conditions, including, but not necessary limited to, their origins, gas composition, pressure, temperature and the amount of condensate present. These include elemental mercury, ammonia, carbon sulfides and mercaptans. It is noticed that sulfur is not only physically soluble in gas or condensate, but also can be chemically bonded to hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The objective of this paper is to explain an integrated work flow of elemental sulfur, mercury and condensate (water and hydrocarbon) identification, bottom-hole sampling process, solubility curves prediction and treatment mitigation during initial gas field development project and present it as a case study, especially during the facilities concept development. The sets of correlation processes are applied as screening to predict elemental sulfur deposition risk. The physical solubility of sulfur in a natural gas increases with pressure and density of the gas phase but is limited by spatial interactions between molecules. Subsequently, it decreases with temperature because the low energy interactions are broken by thermal agitation. The physically dissolved sulfur in a natural gas is sensitive to changes in pressure and temperature; its precipitation will occur as soon as saturation conditions are reached along the production pathway from wells to receiving facilities. In summary, the elemental sulfur deposition for lean (&lt; 1% C2+) sour gas containing H2S, is viable and has higher risks compared to similar sour gas with condensate field, while the elemental sulfur and mercury cannot coexist in the reservoir and in the same time, anhydrites must be present in the formation for elemental sulfur.

TI  - Design and conversion of FPSO mystras
AB  - A recently completed FPSO conversion project shows some novel features in FPSO design. An existing trading tanker was selected for conversion into a 48,000-bopd FPSO unit, for a site offshore Nigeria in a water depth of 70 meters. While engineering of the FPSO was already underway it was discovered that the field production characteristics were underestimated. A crude oil through put of 80,000 bopd was required, which corresponds to a medium size process installation. This happened to be in line with the contractor's g"eneric FPSO" design and left the designers with the challenge of fitting this medium size process installation on a relatively small sized tanker hull. To accommodate the increased size of the production facilities, sponson extensions were fitted over a considerable length of the vessel's side. By the use of sponsons the vessel's main deck area, ballast tank volume and buoyancy were increased considerably. However installation requirements for the spread mooring system, large central pipe rack, separatecable tray supports and marine deck piping still resulted in a congested deck space, which demanded a thoroughly planned lay-out of the main deck arrangement, pushingit beyond existing limits, resultingin an innovative design. This paper addresses and details the design decisions and their backgrounds, also reviewing alternatives considered. Special attention is given to the life extension calculations of the hull structure and the effect on these of adding sponsons and the cantilever supports. And finally, practical experience during vessel conversion and construction from the conversion yard in Dubai is discussed. Copyright 2004, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - DETERMINATION OF CARBON AND NITROGEN IN LITTER FALL OF MANGROVE ECOSYSTEM IN PENINSULAR MALAYSIA
AB  - Mangroves in Peninsular Malaysia are typical of tropical forest setting. Nevertheless, the state of the mangrove forests has led to various classifications; natural and degraded mangroves. The study aimed to utilize litter fall (production and standing crop) potential as a means of evaluating the degree of productivity of the mangrove types across seasons, in addition to determining the abundance of carbon and nitrogen in the Peninsular mangrove forest. Leaf litter accounted for more than 70\% of the total litter production in both natural and degraded mangroves, and the peak month for such production was December; 82.7\% and 82.2\%, for Sungai Haji Dorani and Kuala Selangor Nature Park, respectively. The degraded mangrove recorded higher concentration of total N (6.16 mg/g) than the natural mangrove forest (5.60 mg/g) at significant level. However, the organic carbon (CO) content across the litter parts varied with the three seasons. The CO of leaf litter was at the peak during the dry season, however, analysis on the branch and fruit revealed that during the intermediate and wet seasons CO level could be higher than the concentration observed at dry season. Though, the study concluded that both mangrove types in Peninsular Malaysia showed high similarity in the degree of litter production, yet the identified differences suggest that counter measures need to be adopted in order to protect mangroves from degradation and possible productivity loss.

TI  - The effect of CO2-air mixture compositions on the formation and dissociation of CO2 hydrate
AB  - The disposal of carbon dioxide to the marine and sea bed sediments as CO2 gas hydrate is an innovative technique for solving the global environment issue. Experiments on the formation and dissociation of gas hydrate have been carried out using a pressure vessel to investigate the effect of carbon dioxide concentration in the gas phase. From the experiment results, the following are clarified: (1) There is a strong relationship between the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, concentration, and the temperature of formation and dissociation of gas hydrate. Therefore, the use of this relation enables the estimation of equilibrium conditions of the gas mixture. (2) The initial formation rate varies from 0.1 to 0.5 ml/(min.g). In terms of average values, the initial formation rate increases as the carbon dioxide concentration of the initial gas mixture increases. (3) From the analysis of component gas of gas hydrate and space gas, it can be assumed that nitrogen and oxygen are also incorporated into the hydrate structure cage as guest molecules. Moreover, it can be seen that the carbon dioxide concentration in the initial space gas is higher than that in the space gas at the time of gas hydrate formation. Therefore, this hydrate technology applies to the concentration of carbon dioxide. In future, we will attempt to carry out tests on the formation and dissociation of CO2 hydrate under a low concentration of CO2, Furthermore, we will analyze the structure of gas hydrate using Raman spectroscopy to clarify that nitrogen and oxygen are incorporated into the gas hydrate cage as guest molecules.

TI  - Decarbonizing the energy and industry sectors in Thailand by carbon capture and storage
AB  - In this paper, we evaluate decarbonization opportunities for the power and industry sectors in Thailand by carbon capture and storage (CCS). Stationary CO2 sources from the power sector include coal-fired, natural gas-fired and waste-to-energy power plants. Stationary CO2 sources from the industry sector include cement factories, refineries, iron and steel mills, petrochemical plants, and natural gas processing plants. Potential sites for subsurface CO2 storage include oil fields, gas fields and saline aquifers in four offshore sedimentary basins (Songkhla, Pattani, Chumpon, Malay) and six onshore sedimentary basins (Fang, Phetchabun, Phitsanulok, Suphan Buri, Kamphaeng Saen, and Khorat). Data used in this study come from an extensive review of peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings, and published reports. Results show that stationary CO2 emission from the two sectors is 143 Mtpa consisting of 79 Mtpa from power plants and 64 Mtpa from industrial plants. The biggest CO2 emission in the power sector comes from natural gas-fired power plants whereas that from the industry sector comes from cement factories. There is a total of 79 Gt of subsurface CO2 storage capacity (mid case scenario) in Thailand, which is enough to store 554 years of CO2 emission from stationary sources. Of this, 77.6 Gt (98%) comes from saline aquifers, 1.7 Gt (2%) from gas reservoirs, and only 0.05 Gt (&lt;1%) from oil reservoirs. Therefore, saline aquifers are the most important sites for subsurface CO2 storage. We propose using CCS clusters to reduce the overall project cost by using economies of scale. In a CCS cluster, multiple CO2 sources are mapped to a common CO2 sink by sharing the same CO2 capture, transport, and injection network. A CO2 source-sink mapping exercise results in the identification of six CCS clusters. For Cluster I, we propose a CCS demonstration project by capturing CO2 emitted from cement factories near the city of Saraburi and transporting it to the nearby Sirikit oil field for CO2-enhanced oil recovery. This project can potentially recover 29 MMbbl of incremental oil. For Cluster II, CO2 emitted from natural gas-ired power plants around Bangkok and petrochemical plants in Rayong is captured and stored in saline aquifers in the nearby Khorat Basin. For all other CCS clusters, emitted CO2 can be stored in saline aquifers within a 200 km distance. However, detailed characterization of saline aquifers in Thai sedimentary basins such as caprock integrity, reservoir connectivity, net-to-gross etc., is required to materialize these CCS projects.

TI  - Numerical evaluation of a two-body point absorber wave energy converter with a tuned inerter
AB  - To increase the amount of energy captured from a vibrating buoy in the ocean with a simple mechanism, this paper proposes a two-body point absorber wave energy converter (WEC) with a tuned inerter. The tuned inerter mechanism consists of a spring, a linear damping element, and a component called inerter. This mechanism was originally proposed in the field of civil engineering as a structural control device which can absorb energy from vibrating structures effectively by taking advantage of the resonance effect of the inerter part. In addition to this mechanism where a generator is used as the linear damping element, the current of the generator for the power take-off system is controlled based on the algorithms proposed in literature to achieve further improvement of the power generation capability. In this research, a detailed analytical model of the proposed WEC is introduced and developed. Then the power generation performances of full-scale WEC models are assessed through numerical simulation studies using WAMIT software and it is shown that the current-controlled WEC with the proposed mechanism achieves an 88% increase compared to the conventional one for the JONSWAP spectrum with 6 s peak period and 1 m significant wave height.

AB  - Accurate underwater target tracking during subsea lowering is a complex technological problem in offshore installation and deep ocean mining. It involves the real-time motion compensation of both combined effects from flow-induced vibration on the cable-payload and wave-induced motions on the host vessel. A target tracking mechanism for a planar motion was theoretically derived and simulated in this paper under both regular and irregular wave motions. The simulation results have shown that the proposed target tracking system, by using PID controller integrated with hydrodynamic effects of both surface vessel and subsea payload, has followed the movable subsea target with small vicinity. The findings of this paper can be further implemented in the development of automatizing the subsea operations of the offshore crane system. Â© Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.

TI  - Utilising the flexible generation potential of tidal range power plants to optimise economic value
AB  - Tidal range renewable power plants have the capacity to deliver predictable energy to the electricity grid, subject to the known variability of the tides. Tidal power plants inherently feature advantages that characterise hydro-power more generally, including a lifetime exceeding alternative renewable energy technologies and relatively low Operation & Maintenance costs. Nevertheless, the technology is typically inhibited by the significant upfront investment associated with capital costs. A key aspect that makes the technology stand out relative to other renewable options is the partial flexibility it possesses over the timing of power generation. In this study we provide details on a design methodology targeted at the optimisation of the temporal operation of a tidal range energy structure, specifically the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon that has been proposed within the Bristol Channel, UK. Apart from concentrating on the classical incentive of maximising energy, we formulate an objective functional in a manner that promotes the maximisation of income for the scheme from the Day-Ahead energy market. Simulation results demonstrate that there are opportunities to exploit the predictability of the tides and flexibility over the precise timing of power generation to incur a noticeable reduction in the subsidy costs that are often negotiated with regulators and governments. Additionally, we suggest that this approach should enable tidal range energy to play a more active role in ensuring security of supply in the UK. This is accentuated by the income-based optimisation controls that deliver on average more power over periods when demand is higher. For the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon case study a 23% increase is observed in the income obtained following the optimisation of its operation compared to a non-adaptive operation. Similarly, a 10% increase relative to an energy-maximisation approach over a year's operation suggests that simply maximising energy generation in a setting where power prices vary may not be an optimal strategy.

TI  - Good news, bad news for U.S. offshore wind power johanna knapschaefer
AB  - Statoil, developer of the world's first full-scale floating wind turbine, is reporting good performance on its 2.3- MW test project near the North Sea. The Norwegian company is targeting the Gulf of Maine as a site for a 12- MW floating-turbine test wind farm, despite the tough US environment for wind-energy development. If constructed, this would be the first floating wind turbine farm in the US. In a related development, Seattle-based Principle Power and Energias de Portugal (EDP) recently reported that they successfully have deployed a 2.0-MW deepwater turbine called WindFloat by towing the unit 215 miles and installing it at a site six miles off the coast of Agucadoura, Portugal. The BOEM meeting occurred four days before NRG Energy announced it was closing its Princeton, N.J., office and putting its offshore wind development projects on hold in Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland and Massachusetts due to monumental challenges in developing a new domestic industry.

TI  - Wind farm water area path planning algorithm based on Aâˆ— and reinforcement learning
AB  - In recent years, the scale of offshore wind farms is increasing because of the high efficiency and pollution-free wind power resources. However, the introduction of many facilities in the corresponding wind farm sea area has led to the increasing difficulty of ship navigation. Therefore, it is very important to plan safe and efficient driving path according to the corresponding starting and ending points for the navigation of ships in the increasing wind farm area. In this paper, a path planning algorithm based on the hybrid method of Aâˆ— algorithm and reinforcement learning is proposed, which can plan an effective collision avoidance path for the sea area of wind farm. Then the method is used to simulate the ship's path planning in a wind farm, which proves the feasibility of the method. Finally, it shows that the method has universal reference significance for ship navigation in the wind farm waters. Â© 2019 IEEE.

TI  - Twenty years of marine carbon cycle observations at Devils Hole Bermuda provide insights into seasonal hypoxia, coral reef calcification, and ocean acidification
AB  - Open-ocean observations have revealed gradual changes in seawater carbon dioxide (CO2) chemistry resulting from uptake of atmospheric CO2 and ocean acidification (OA), but, with few long-term records ( &gt; 5 years) of the coastal ocean that can reveal the pace and direction of environmental change. In this paper, observations collected from 1996 to 2016 at Harrington Sound, Bermuda, constitute one of the longest time-series of coastal ocean inorganic carbon chemistry. Uniquely, such changes can be placed into the context of contemporaneous offshore changes observed at the nearby Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site. Onshore, surface dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2; &gt; 10% change per decade) have increased and OA indicators such as pH and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) saturation state (Î©) decreased from 1996 to 2016 at a rate of two to three times that observed offshore at BATS. Such changes, combined with reduction of total alkalinity over time, reveal a complex interplay of biogeochemical processes influencing Bermuda reef metabolism, including net ecosystem production (NEP = gross primary production-autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration) and net ecosystem calcification (NEC = gross calcification-gross CaCO3 dissolution). These long-term data show a seasonal shift between wintertime net heterotrophy and summertime net autotrophy for the entire Bermuda reef system. Over annual time-scales, the Bermuda reef system does not appear to be in trophic balance, but rather slightly net heterotrophic. In addition, the reef system is net accretive (i.e., gross calcification &gt; gross CaCO3 dissolution), but there were occasional periods when the entire reef system appears to transiently shift to net dissolution. A previous 5-year study of the Bermuda reef suggested that net calcification and net heterotrophy have both increased. Over the past 20 years, rates of net calcification and net heterotrophy determined for the Bermuda reef system have increased by ~30%, most likely due to increased coral nutrition occurring in concert with increased offshore productivity in the surrounding subtropical North Atlantic Ocean. Importantly, this long-term study reveals that other environmental factors (such as coral feeding) can mitigate against the effects of ocean acidification on coral reef calcification, at least over the past couple of decades.

TI  - Wave farm planning through high-resolution resource and performance characterization
AB  - Wave farm planning in a coastal region should lead to the selection of: i) the type of technology of wave energy converter (WEC) providing the highest performance at specific sites and ii) the sites for wave farm operation allowing an integrated coastal zone management (ICZM). On these bases, the deployment of a wave farm should be based on an accurate analysis of the performance of different WECs at coastal locations where wave energy exploitation does not interfere with other coastal uses, and the environmental impact is minimised (or positive, e.g. allowing coastal protection). With this in view, in this piece of research the intra-annual performance of various WECs of the same type (buoy-type) is computed at different locations in NW Spain allowing an ICZM perspective. For this purpose, the intra-annual version of WEDGE-p (R) (Wave Energy Diagram Generator - performance) tool is implemented. The results show that, as opposed to previous analysis on WECs with different principle of operation, the level of performance of buoy-type WECs at specific locations may present strong similarities. In this case, an accurate computation of different performance parameters along with their joint analysis emerge as a prerequisite for an informed decision-making. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Techno-economic challenges of tidal energy conversion systems: Current status and trends
AB  - The potential of generating electricity from marine tidal currents is enormous. Tidal energy is a renewable source that has an additional value in a future energy market with regard to other renewable energy sources thanks to its high predictability. Moreover, tidal energy technologies are characterized by CO2 emission-free power, thus enabling energy security and contributing to economic growth and job creation in coastal and remote areas. Substantial progress is currently,being made by the European Union as regards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency, in order to fulfil the target of an installed capacity of 3.6 GW of ocean energy by 2020, and to achieve a future installed capacity of 188 GW of ocean energy in 2050. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the current status of tidal energy conversion technologies and describes the costs incurred in the development of tidal energy projects so as to study their economic viability. The study also identifies the principal current risks and the role of each of the stakeholders involved in the successful development of tidal energy projects. Finally, future challenges in tidal technologies that will influence the increase in their current potential are briefly presented along with the current developments of our research group in the field of tidal energy converters design.

TI  - Online Distributed Voltage Control of an offshore MTdc network using reinforcement learning
AB  - This paper addresses one of the main challenges on the way to an offshore transnational multi-terminal dc (MTdc) network: its control and operation. The main objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to control, in real time, a multi-terminal dc network aimed at integrating offshore wind farms (OWFs). This method of controlling MTdc networks using RL techniques is called Online Distributed Voltage Control (ODVC). The ODVC strategy uses Continuous Action Reinforcement Learning Automata (CARLA) to optimize power flows in real time. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed control method, dynamic simulations are carried out using a MTdc grid model composed of six nodes, interconnecting three offshore wind farms to three European countries. The results obtained demonstrate the advantages of implementing an online distributed voltage control strategy to obtain feasible controlled power flows with low transmission losses. The results obtained demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method to control, in real time, MTdc networks and that the RL techniques are well-suited for this problem due to their inherent advantages of coping with stochastic environments.

TI  - CO2 sequestration in deepwater subseabed formations
AB  - Recent studies have estimated that oceans have naturally sequestrated, by dissolving and mixing with deep waters, about 40% of the anthropogenic CO 2 emitted since the start of the industrial revolution. Moreover, the International Maritime Organization has recently announced that storage of CO2 under the seabed would be allowed starting in 2007. To date, almost all studies, simulations and technical papers concerning carbon sequestration have focused on storing supercritical CO2 in deep saline aquifers or depleted oil and gas reservoirs. However, a critical limiting factor for such carbon sequestration is the need for proper physical trapping and the necessity for monitoring the upward migration due to buoyancy effects and mobility of supercritical CO2. Carbon sequestration in deepwater sub-seabed formations provides an attractive alternative. This paper presents a feasibility study of carbon sequestration in deepwater formations in the Gulf of Mexico with the existing technologies available in the offshore industry. We describe each step of the carbon capture and storage process and discuss the technical limitations when trying to capture CO2 from industrial processes, transport it offshore via tanker, drill a CO2 injector well and then, inject the CO2 from floating facilities such as drill ships or semi-submersible vessels. Due to high pressures and low temperatures reigning at water depths deeper than 9,000 feet, the liquid CO2 injected in the first few hundred feet of deposits will have a higher density than the surrounding formation pore-fluid and therefore will be buoyantly trapped. In addition, CO2 hydrates that may form and fill up pore spaces will act as an additional trapping mechanism. Finally, at these great depths, the CO2 that could leak will dissolve by reacting with ocean waters and forming mainly bicarbonate compounds. Because oceans cover about 70% of the Earth's surface with an average water depth of 12,500 feet, deepwater sub-seabed sequestration provides an enormous storage capacity to mitigate increasing world consumption of fossil fuels. However, large time and space-scale simulations need to be performed to estimate the impact of the change in geochemistry in the deepwater seabed region. Also, the injection of liquid CO2 will force and displace formation fluid into the seabed surface zone, which will change the ocean chemistry. Copyright 2010, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - Development of an Efficient Load Frequency Controller for Pico Hydropower Generation System in Sewage Treatment Plant
AB  - Over the past few decades, with the rapid industrial development and population increase, electricity has become a necessity, and thereby a tremendous rise in demand has been created. However, given the growing concerns about climate change and the depletion of fossil fuels, it is essential to utilise renewable sources of electricity generation. By harnessing electricity through moving water, the Pico Hydropower Generation System (PHPGS) is among the most attractive small-scale hydropower and cost-effective sustainable energy technologies available. Naturally, moving water can be found in rivers and man-made conduits where there is a continuous water flow. The sewage treatment facility has continuous water flow at the effluent pipe that can generate electricity by means of a small hydropower system. According to the literature, a micro hydro turbine system with a maximum power output of 38 kW was installed as a pilot trial in Hong Kong's Stonecutters Island STP, which uses sewage flow hydro energy for in-house use [15]. However, the power generated is based on the higher flow rate and outfall discharge head. Our research focus is on harvesting energy from lower flow rate and outfall discharge head by implementing the PHPGS in IWK's STP and using intelligent efficient controller to maintain voltage and frequency within limits as the incoming STP final effluent flowrate changes under dynamic conditions. Taking the other Pico Hydropower plant research work application as a comparison, the fixed control system from the previous research work does not offer the dynamic response monitoring for Pico Hydropower plants when the water incoming flow rates into the hydro turbine are varied. The purpose of this research was to develop an efficient PHPGS control system for a residential STP's continuous effluent discharge point with a low head and high flow fluctuations. This research proposes a combination of fuzzy and PID controllers for Self-Excitation Induction Generator (SEIG) voltage and frequency control and monitors the voltage quality through the efficient Load Frequency Controller (LFC) system under the final effluent incoming flow rate variation into the turbine. A Pico Hydropower plant has been modelled and simulated using the MATLAB/Simulink software. The operational limitation of this PHPGS model is determined within Â± 20% from the STP average flow rate of 0.194 m3 /s. Through the disturbance which given at 4 (flow rate increased by 20%), the performance comparison between coordinated PID-Fuzzy, Fuzzy and conventional PID controllers in terms of dynamic response has been carried out. The results obtained showed that a coordinated PID-Fuzzy controller is more effective as compared to a Fuzzy or a conventional PID controller in terms of overshoots, rise time, settling time & steady state error with respect to increment of the final effluent incoming flow rate into the turbine. Overall, the outcome of modelling shows that the voltage and frequency remain efficiently within acceptable limits at 400 V and 50 Hz respectively as the incoming STP final effluent flow rate increased by 20% from the STP average flow rate of 0.194 m3/s.

TI  - Hydrokinetic Power Conversion Using Vortex-Induced Oscillation with Cubic Restoring Force
AB  - A cubic-spring restoring function with high-deformation stiffening is introduced to passively improve the harnessed marine hydrokinetic power by using flow-induced oscillations/vibrations (FIO/V) of a cylinder. In these FIO/V experiments, a smooth, rigid, single-cylinder on elastic end-supports is tested at Reynolds numbers ranging from 24,000 < Re < 120,000. The parameters of the tested current energy converter (CEC) are cubic stiffness and linear damping. Using the second generation of digital virtual spring-damping (Vck) controller developed by the Marine Renewable Energy Laboratory (MRELab), the cubic modeling of the oscillator stiffness is tested. Experimental results show the influence of the parameter variation on the amplitude, frequency, energy conversion, energy efficiency, and power of the converter. All experiments are conducted in the low turbulence-free surface water (LTFSW) channel of the MRELab of the University of Michigan. The main conclusions are: (1) The nonlinearity in the cubic oscillator is an effective way to extend the vortex-induced vibration (VIV) upper branch, which results in higher harnessing power and efficiency compared to the linear stiffness cylinder converter. (2) Compared to the linear converter, the overall power increase is substantial. The nonlinear power optimum, occurring at the end of the VIV upper branch, is 63\% higher than its linear counterpart. (3) The cubic stiffness converter with low harnessing damping achieves consistently good performance in all the VIV regions because of the hardening restoring force, especially at higher flow velocity.

The starting mechanism of the turbine is revealed through analyzing the interaction of its motion and dynamics during starting process. The operating hydrodynamic characteristics of the turbine in wave-current condition are also explored by combining with the linear wave theory. According to possible magnification of the cyclic loads in the maximum power tracking control of vertical axis turbine, a novel torque control strategy is put forward, which can improve the structural characteristics significantly without effecting energy efficiency.

TI  - Salt Water Activated Power System (SWAPS) for ocean buoys and related platforms
AB  - Ocean buoys often rely on batteries, solar cells, and wind and wave generated power to drive on-board instrumentation and communications equipment. Power demands are increasing as instrument requirements are added and deployment times extended. Un-tethered, station-keeping buoys also use much more energy and power for propulsion. Mil3, Inc has developed a superior Seawater Activated Power Source (SWAPSâ„¢, patent-applied) which is more portable, safe, and economical for marine buoys and related applications. SWAPS utilizes a metal alloy reacting with saltwater to produce hydrogen as fuel for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells to produce electricity at efficiencies approaching 50%. With an energy density of 1.4 kWh/kg and scalability for power requirements of watts to kilowatts, SWAPS is lighter and less expensive than batteries, and can always produce 100% of its design output power. The only chemical by-product is a metal hydroxide which naturally occurs in seawater. SWAPS stores potential energy in its alloy fuel, provides power on-demand, is inherently self-regulating, and requires no moving parts or external control In contrast, batteries represent low energy density, excessive mass and volume and prohibitive costs for many applications. Bulky solar panels, and wind and wave driven generators do not provide energy storage and are dependent on factors such as time of day, weather conditions, tides, currents, and wind velocity. The best of these technologies may only produce 45% of its design power, which requires over-sizing and energy storage by batteries. Mil3 has proved the operation of an 80 W SWAPS unit on a prototype buoy representing a large meteorological buoy to be deployed for 6 months. Together with Falmouth Scientific Inc., Mil3 has also successfully demonstrated the use of a 35 kWh SWAPS unit to provide 180 W (220 W peak) to a station-keeping spar buoy built for the Navy. In sea states between 3 and 4, SWAPS consistently powered the buoy prop motor against currents greater than 1 knot, all instrumentation and radio telemetry, while additionally charging a Li-ion backup battery. The team is preparing a new SWAPS unit for providing all power for a 40 kW Navy acoustic pulsed power system. Â©2009 MTS.

TI  - Investigation of graphene effect on the anti-corrosion behaviour of polyurethane coatings in sea-water
AB  - Purpose Abundant oil and gas reservoirs in the deep-water are the valuable non-renewable energy sources. However, sea-water could enhance the corrosion of marine equipment such as submarine pipe trees. Various coatings, for example, polyurethane (PU) coatings are sprayed on the steel surfaces to enhance the anti-corrosion performance. Thus, to improve the anti-corrosion behavior of PU coatings in sea-water is imperative. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the corrosion behaviors of 4130 carbon steel with and without PU coatings were discussed by electrochemical mean in sea-water. And the graphene additive in different concentrations (0.1, 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 per cent) were also studied. A series of characterized methods were introduced to identify the anti-corrosion performances of 4130 carbon steel with and without coatings, respectively. Findings The results showed that the anti-corrosion property of 4130 carbon steel can enhance obviously with the PU coatings. The graphene additive can further improve the anti-corrosion behaviour of PU coatings and in the concentration of 0.6 per cent the PU/graphene coatings worked best. Originality/value This is beneficial for enhancing the service life of marine equipment in an eco-friendly method.

TI  - Growth of ocean thermal energy conversion resources under greenhouse warming regulated by oceanic eddies
AB  - Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) resources provide a renewable solution to fuel our future. Here the authors show a significant increase of OTEC resources under greenhouse warming with the increasing rate regulated by oceanic eddies. The concept of utilizing a large temperature difference (>20 degrees C) between the surface and deep seawater to generate electricity, known as the ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), provides a renewable solution to fueling our future. However, it remains poorly assessed how the OTEC resources will respond to future climate change. Here, we find that the global OTEC power potential is projected to increase by 46\% around the end of this century under a high carbon emission scenario, compared to its present-day level. The augmented OTEC power potential due to the rising sea surface temperature is partially offset by the deep ocean warming. The offsetting effect is more evident in the Atlantic Ocean than Pacific and Indian Oceans. This is mainly attributed to the weakening of mesoscale eddy-induced upward heat transport, suggesting an important role of mesoscale eddies in regulating the response of thermal stratification and OTEC power potential to greenhouse warming.

TI  - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS): Risk assessment focused on marine bacteria
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one of the options to mitigate the negative effects of the climate change. However, this strategy may have associated some risks such as CO2 leakages due to an escape from the reservoir. In this context, marine bacteria have been underestimated. In order to figure out the gaps and the lack of knowledge, this work summarizes different studies related to the potential effects on the marine bacteria associated with an acidification caused by a CO2 leak from CSS. An improved integrated model for risk assessment is suggested as a tool based on the rapid responses of bacterial community. Moreover, this contribution proposes a strategy for laboratory protocols using Pseudomona stanieri (CECT7202) as a case of study and analyzes the response of the strain under different CO2 conditions. Results showed significant differences (pâ‰¤0.05) under six diluted enriched medium and differences about the days in the exponential growth phase. Dilution 1:10 (Marine Broth 2216 with seawater) was selected as an appropriate growth medium for CO2 toxicity test in batch cultures. This work provide an essential and a complete tool to understand and develop a management strategy to improve future works related to possible effects produced by potential CO2 leaks.

TI  - The development of the regulatory compliance scheme for the Gulf of Mexico's first ship-shaped DP floating production unit (FPU)
AB  - Between 1995 and 2006, the standard formula for the certification of floating offshore installations in the US regions of the Gulf of Mexico has remained the same. This formula is derived based on a floating offshore installation being US flagged and reviewed to the requirements of Title 33 of the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Subchapter N. The HELIX PRODUCER I began as a German flagged, Germanischer Lloyd Classed, Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) certified train ferry that was built in 1986. Arriving in Rijeka Croatia in June of 2006, the vessel was planned to be converted to a dynamically positioned offshore supply vessel which then turned into a conversion project to a Bahamian flagged ship-shaped dynamically positioned disconnectable floating production unit classed by Lloyd's Register (LR) intended to operate in the Gulf of Mexico. The standard formula for certification had to change, but compliance had to be equivalent to that of the CFR. To accomplish this, a Regulatory Compliance Scheme had to be developed between Helix Energy Solutions Group, Lloyd's Register, and the USCG. The details of this Regulatory Compliance Scheme and execution methodology to achieve LR Class, SOLAS Certification, and USCG Compliance are presented. This is an abstract of a paper presented at the Offshore Technology Conference 2011 (Houston, TX 5/2-5/2011).

TI  - Development of a permanent OBC system for CCS monitoring in shallow marine environments
AB  - In the CCS monitoring, time-lapse 3D seismic survey is necessary and microseismic monitoring is also required to assure the safe CCS operations. In order to fulfill these requirements efficiently, we are developing a permanent Ocean Bottom Cable system (OBC) in shallow marine environments. The system can figure out the extent of CO2 injected area and assure that CO2 is not escaped above seal rocks. The use of the system is advantageous from the long term view of the cost. In this paper, we, firstly, present a simulation study based on the data from the Nagaoka CCS test site. 4D response was evaluated using crossplot of NRMS and PRED indices so that we could estimate the discrimination degree between 4D responses caused by CO2 injection and other 4D noises. Basic test experiments of a permanent OBC system have been conducted in Sites A and B in Japan and repeated seismic surveys using airgun source were shot for evaluating the 4D noise response. Tidal correction is found not to be simple as the wavelet shape itself is modified in the shallow water condition. P-SV reflections are recorded with three-component geophones installed in the OBC which will contribute to the CCS reservoir characterization and monitoring. A microseismic event with the magnitude of 0.6 occurred at the depth of 103 kilometers just below Site A was detected. As the CO2 geological sequestration will be conducted within several thousand meters, detectable limit is estimated down to magnitude minus two in an ideal condition. (C) 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Three configurations of voltage source converter multi-terminal HVDC transmission for large offshore wind farms are studied. The voltage-current characteristics of the converters are shown and the operation of the converters with different power output from the wind farms is discussed. The control system is designed to achieve automatic coordination between the converters without the need of fast communication between them. The operation of the multi-terminal HVDC transmission with the control system is tested through simulations using PSCAD/EMTDC and through experiments on a three-terminal test rig. The simulation and experimental results show good agreement.

TI  - DeepStarÂ® global offshore technology development program 12504: Real-Time monitoring for critical barriers
AB  - In this paper, we will share the results of the collaborative efforts completed during Phase XII of the DeepStar joint industry technology development project; specifically, the results ofCTR 12504. Real-Time Monitoring for Critical Barriers, which was conducted within the X500 Drilling and Completions committee in 2016. We will outline the process used to identify the critical data needed to verify and maintain primary and secondary barriers to flow within deepwater wells, required to conduct safe offshore drilling operations. The objectives of Real-Time Monitoring for Critical Barriers were to identify and define critical data sources required for the real-Time monitoring of both, the drilling margins and physical safety barriers. The use of real-Time data monitoring has now become a regulatory requirement for US deepwater and critical well operations. The scope of this work covered the Drilling, Completion, Well Testing and Well Intervention phases of a well's life cycle. An international perspective was employed by integrating the barrier strategies of API RP 96, NORSOK D-10. lOGP Reports 415 / 544. UKOG Well Life Cycle Integrity Guidelines, 30 CFR Part 250 Final Rule and NAS TRB Report 322. From these documents, the common themes and definitions were examined to produce a matrix that defined the primary and secondary barrier envelopes, identify the rig sensors for their validation, then insure that they are verified and maintained during the various operations conducted over the life of the well. The real-Time data monitoring, considered in this effort, included sensors on the drilling rig's hoisting and mud systems, downhole tools, and to the largely independent sub-sea BOP stack. While the rig and downhole tool sensing equipment is fairly standardized across the industry, the same cannot be said for sub- sea BOP systems. While individual BOP vendor systems share similar overall design structures, the sensors, measurement protocols, system architecture, and data processing are unique to each.

TI  - An analysis of the wind climate at potential UK offshore wind farm sites
AB  - With an increasing number of wind farms being planned offshore, there is a need for a better understanding of the wind climatology at offshore sites and the correlation between onshore and offshore winds for the purposes of resource assessment and for short-term forecasting. This paper presents an analysis of data from five UK offshore masts. The data at two masts have been used to calculate the atmospheric stability statistics at these sites showing that unstable conditions persist for a large amount of the time at these sites. Onshore data from a number of coastal meteorological sites has been used to calculate the observed ratio between offshore and onshore wind when the wind is blowing from onshore to offshore. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model and a semi-empirical formula have been used to calculate the expected offshore to onshore wind speed ratio for different offshore stability conditions. The results indicate that these models under-predict the ratios except very close to the coast. More detailed mesoscale modelling may be required to obtain more accurate estimates of the expected ratio.

TI  - Ocean urea fertilization for carbon credits poses high ecological risks
AB  - The proposed plan for enrichment of the Sulu Sea, Philippines, a region of rich marine biodiversity, with thousands of tonnes of urea in order to stimulate algal blooms and sequester carbon is flawed for multiple reasons. Urea is preferentially used as a nitrogen source by some cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates, many of which are neutrally or positively buoyant. Biological pumps to the deep sea are classically leaky, and the inefficient burial of new biomass makes the estimation of a net loss of carbon from the atmosphere questionable at best. The potential for growth of toxic dinoflagellates is also high, as many grow well on urea and some even increase their toxicity when grown on urea. Many toxic dinoflagellates form cysts which can settle to the sediment and germinate in subsequent years, forming new blooms even without further fertilization. If large-scale blooms do occur, it is likely that they will contribute to hypoxia in the bottom waters upon decomposition. Lastly, urea production requires fossil fuel usage, further limiting the potential for net carbon sequestration. The environmental and economic impacts are potentially great and need to be rigorously assessed. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Technological notes. Technological options for the valorization of offshore natural gas [Apuntes tecnolÃ³gicas. Opciones tecnolÃ³gicas para la valorizaciÃ³n del gas natural costa afuera]
AB  - Venezuela has proven reserves of associated natural gas of 147 bcf, 38 bcf of probable reserves, and 41 bcf of possible reserves. These reserves are illustrated by area, i.e., west, south, east, north of Paria, and the Deltana offshore platform. Of the total Venezuelan natural gas reserves of 256.5 bcf, 88.1% (226 bcf) relate to associated gas and 11.9% (30.5 bcf) to non-associated gas. However, the independence of gas production free of the OPEC quota that restricts the extraction of associated gas, generates a special interest in the production of this small percentage of the gas resource. Of the non associated gas, 17 bcf correspond to the zone north of Paria and the Deltana platform. These are strategic areas for the exterior commerce of gas. It is for this reason that Venezuela starts to initiate the operations of the offshore Mariscal Sucre project in Sucre state and Deltana platform with the proposition to expand the Venezuelan natural gas industry by filling the need for gas in the domestic market, increasing the proven reserves, and participating in the growing markets abroad to generate a maximum added value. The discussion covers the engineering aspects of this development. The problems offshore include a limited formation of hydrates and wear and tear on the piping generated mainly by corrosion (85% at the Deltana platform and 72% in the Mariscal Sucre) and to a less extent erosion by liquids and solids. The rates of corrosion in the pipelines from the offshore installations to the mainland are 1.18 mm/yr from the Deltana platform and 0.90 mm/yr from the Mariscal Sucre. The rate of erosion for this piping from the Deltana platform is 0.21 mm/yr and from the Mariscal Sucre is 0.35 mm/yr. The useful life of this piping without treatment is 9.6 yr for the Deltana platform and 15.65 yr for the Mariscal Sucre piping. The useful life of each piping system with treatment is > 20 yr.

TI  - Tidally driven export of dissolved organic carbon, total mercury, and methylmercury from a mangrove-dominated estuary
AB  - The flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from mangrove swamps accounts for 10% of the global terrestrial flux of DOC to coastal oceans. Recent findings of high concentrations of mercury (Hg) and methylmercury (MeHg) in mangroves, in conjunction with the common co-occurrence of DOC and Hg species, have raised concerns that mercury fluxes may also be large. We used a novel approach to estimate export of DOC, Hg, and MeHg to coastal waters from a mangrove-dominated estuary in Everglades National Park (Florida, USA). Using in situ measurements of fluorescent dissolved organic matter as a proxy for DOC, filtered total Hg, and filtered MeHg, we estimated the DOC yield to be 180 (Â±12.6) g C m -2 yr -1, which is in the range of previously reported values. Although Hg and MeHg yields from tidal mangrove swamps have not been previously measured, our estimated yields of Hg species (28 Â± 4.5 Î¼g total Hg m -2 yr -1 and 3.1 Â± 0.4 Î¼g methyl Hg m -2 yr -1) were five times greater than is typically reported for terrestrial wetlands. These results indicate that in addition to the well documented contributions of DOC, tidally driven export from mangroves represents a significant potential source of Hg and MeHg to nearby coastal waters.

TI  - Effects of calcification on air-water CO2 fluxes in tropical seagrass meadows: A mesocosm experiment
AB  - Seagrass meadows deliver a range of ecosystem services, where one of the more important is the capacity to store carbon and serve as sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide. The capacity of seagrass meadows for carbon storage might, however, be modified and complicated by several factors; one important factor is the possible effects of calcification within the meadows. In tropical areas, seagrass meadows can contain high proportions of calcareous organisms, which through their calcification may cause release of CO2. To study this aspect of the CO2 balance within tropical seagrass systems, we investigated the air-water CO2 flux in seagrass mesocosms with different plant community compositions, i.e. mixtures of seagrass and calcifying macroalgae, having similar overall photosynthetic oxygen evolution rates. The measured CO2 fluxes changed both in rate and direction over the day and were significantly related to plant community composition. Downward fluxes of CO2 were found only over vegetation with high proportion of seagrass and in the afternoon, whereas occurrence of calcifying algae appeared to reverse the flow. A partial least squares (PLS) regression model indicated that pH, pCO2 and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were the primary environmental variables predicting the CO2 fluxes. Our findings show that algal calcification might partly counteract the carbon sequestration in seagrass meadows. Â© 2022 The Authors

TI  - A STUDY OF THE EXTRACTION OF CO2 FROM THE FLUE-GAS OF A 500 MW PULVERIZED COAL FIRED BOILER
AB  - CO2 can be removed from the flue gas of existing pulverised coal fired power stations by retrofitting a new process which recovers the CO2 as a pure liquid by distillation. The boiler is modified to burn the fuel in a CO2 and Oxygen mixture instead of air. Flue gas is partly recycled and mixed with oxygen from an air separation plant for fuel combustion. Excess flue gas is compressed, liquefied and distilled into pure CO2 and SO2 plus NO2 products. Net power generating efficiency and capital cost of the retrofit are given. The economics Of CO2 disposal in an offshore depleted gas reservoir and for enhanced oil recovery are presented.

TI  - The Indian 1 MW demonstration OTEC plant and the pre-commissioning tests
AB  - Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) utilizes the thermal gradient available in the ocean to operate a heat engine to produce work output. Even though the concept is simple and old for almost one century, recently it has gained momentum due to worldwide search for clean continuous energy sources to replace the fossil fuels. There are technological hurdles to overcome to tap the immense potential of OTEC. But still the technology is mature enough to establish commercial power plants. National Institute of Ocean Technology was involved in the design, development and demonstration of a 1 MW OTEC floating plant-the largest of its kind-in the Indian waters. This is to be commissioned 60 km south east of Tuticorin, South India where an ocean depth of 1200m available. The site surveys, computer analysis, model studies were done in 1999. The basic power cycle design was completed within 4 months. The plant was integrated and stage qualification tests were carried out in 2000-02. The project is to be commissioned in January 2003. This paper is projecting the technological and economical aspects of the OTEC with an overview of the various pre-commissioning activities of the project.

TI  - Motions of a 5 MW floating VAWT evaluated by numerical simulations and model tests
AB  - The VAWT (vertical axis wind turbine) has advantages in the development of large-scale offshore wind power. This paper presents a motion study of a 5 MW floating VAWT composed of the {*} type Darrieus wind turbine and the spar type floating foundation with heave plates. A computing code of aerodynamic loads was developed considering the dynamic stall and the floating foundation motions. The motion equations of the floating VAWT were established and solved numerically. Model tests were conducted, and the results of heave and pitch motion in test were compared with that of numerical calculation. The PRAOs (pseudo response amplitude operators) of numerical calculation are found to agree well with the experimental data with wave only conditions, and have some little discrepancies with wave and wind conditions. The surge-heave-pitch motions of the floating VAWT were analyzed. The results show that the aerodynamic forces have minimal influence on the heave motions of the floating VAWT, while they obviously increase the mean values of surge and pitch motions. The surge, heave and pitch frequencies of the floating VAWT are dominated by the wave frequencies, and the 2P (twice-per-revolution) response of pitch motions is not significant.

TI  - Novel two-stage electrical energy generators for highly-variable and low-speed linear or rotary input motions
AB  - A novel class of two-stage, vibration-based electrical energy generators is presented for linear or rotary input motions in applications which the input speed is relatively low and varies significantly over time such as wind mills, turbo-machinery used to harvest tidal flows, devices for harnessing coastal wave energy, and the like. Current technologies use magnet-and-coil based electrical generators in such machinery. However, to make the generation cycle efficient, gearing or other similar mechanisms must be used to increase the input speed. Variable speed-control mechanisms are also usually needed to achieve high energy conversion efficiency. Additionally, in many applications, such as those where energy is to be harvested from very low frequency oscillations of a platform such as a buoy or a ship, the use of speed increasing mechanisms such as gearing or the like is impractical. In this paper, a novel class of two-stage electrical energy generators that could operate with very low speed and highly variable input rotations and/or oscillations is described. The first stage consists of simple linkage mechanisms, which are used to excite vibratory elements. These two-stage generators are designed to convert low-speed and highly variable input rotations and oscillations to relatively high and constant frequency vibratory motions, which are then used to generate electrical energy using mechanical to electrical energy conversion devices such as piezoelectric elements. The design of a number of such two-stage generators together with a discussion of their potential applications is presented. Specifically, the computer simulated output of a small wave energy harvester design is presented. Copyright Â© 2009 by ASME.

TI  - Case study: Optimized field architecture for electrical boosting in deepwater
AB  - Currently the field architecture for most deepwater developments has been dictated by flow assurance constraints due to a reliance on conventional dual flowline loops with riser base gas lifting. Subsea boosting and separation technology will help expand these traditional boundaries and hence facilitate the operation of longer, deeper pipelines transporting fluids with lower temperatures and pressures. Providing power to remote subsea equipment, which consume power measured in mega watts, will result in power distribution becoming a new driver for field architecture. High voltages will not necessarily be compatible with current power and control technology. Contractors will therefore have to engineer and deploy large subsea units and integrated power and control umbilicals to match the new field architecture. The reliability of the power distribution system takes on a greater importance. Simply put, loss of electrical power will equal loss of production. How contractors adapt and qualify new technology during the design and installation phases of a project will be a key to its success. A case study will be presented for boosting a remote deepwater oil field comparing the flowline and umbilical sizes and power requirements for different field layout options. The paper will highlight the implications that the power distribution systems have on the optimization of the field architecture. Copyright 2010, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Comparative evaluation of the HVDC and HVAC links integrated in a large offshore wind farman actual case study in Taiwan
AB  - This paper mainly focuses on the transient voltage and frequency responses of a large offshore wind farm integrated system in Taiwan. It adopts a simulation study by using different submarine cable technologies and wind turbine types, including high-voltage direct current (HVDC) link based on line-commutated converter (LCC), high-voltage alternating current (HVAC) link, and three types of wind turbines. In addition, it utilizes an actual system that connects the Taiwan grid and a 200-MW offshore wind farm in the Penghu area via two submarine cables. The aim of this paper is to analyze the transient characteristics of both the HVDC and the HVAC connected wind power systems. According to the simulation results, it shows that the HVDC link can provide better voltage and frequency responses, which are independent on the types of wind turbines. Moreover, the HVDC link can alleviate the effect of grid faults on the wind farm and provide the wind farm better voltage and frequency stability. Â© 1972-2012 IEEE.

TI  - An Improved Modal Strain Energy Method for Damage Detection in Offshore Platform Structures
AB  - The development of robust damage detection methods for offshore structures is crucial to prevent catastrophes caused by structural failures. In this research, we developed an Improved Modal Strain Energy (IMSE) method for detecting damage in offshore platform structures based on a traditional modal strain energy method (the Stubbs index method). The most significant difference from the Stubbs index method was the application of modal frequencies. The goal was to improve the robustness of the traditional method. To demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed IMSE method, both numerical and experimental studies were conducted for different damage scenarios using a jacket platform structure. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the IMSE method in damage location when only limited, spatially incomplete, and noise-polluted modal data is available. Comparative studies showed that the IMSE index outperformed the Stubbs index and exhibited stronger robustness, confirming the superiority of the proposed approach.

TI  - Characterization of the CO2 System in a Coral Reef, a Seagrass Meadow, and a Mangrove Forest in the Central Red Sea
AB  - The Red Sea is characterized by its high seawater temperature and salinity, and the resilience of its coastal ecosystems to global warming is of growing interest. This high salinity and temperature might also render the Red Sea a favorable ecosystem for calcification and therefore resistant to ocean acidification. However, there is a lack of survey data on the CO2 system of Red Sea coastal ecosystems. A 1-year survey of the CO2 system was performed in a seagrass lagoon, a mangrove forest, and a coral reef in the central Red Sea, including fortnight seawater sampling and high-frequency pH(T) monitoring. In the coral reef, the CO2 system mean and variability over the measurement period are within the range of other world's reefs with pH(T), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity (TA), pCO(2,) and omega(arag) of 8.016 +/- 0.077, 2061 +/- 58 mu mol/kg, 2415 +/- 34 mu mol/kg, 461 +/- 39 mu atm, and 3.9 +/- 0.4, respectively. Here, comparisons with an offshore site highlight dominance of calcification and photosynthesis in summer-autumn, and dissolution and heterotrophy in winter-spring. In the seagrass meadow, the pH(T), DIC, TA, pCO(2), and omega(arag) were 8.00 +/- 0.09, 1986 +/- 68 mu mol/kg, 2352 +/- 49 mu mol/kg, 411 +/- 66 mu atm, and 4.0 +/- 0.3, respectively. The seagrass meadow TA and DIC were consistently lower than offshore water. The mangrove forest showed the highest amplitudes of variation, with pH(T), DIC, TA, pCO(2), and omega(arag), were 7.95 +/- 0.26, 2069 +/- 132 mu mol/kg, 2438 +/- 91 mu mol/kg, 493 +/- 178 mu atm, and 4.1 +/- 0.6, respectively. We highlight the need for more research on sources and sinks of DIC and TA in coastal ecosystems.

TI  - Emergent marine toxins risk assessment using molecular and chemical approaches
AB  - Cyanobacteria harmful blooms represent a deviation to the normal equilibrium in planktonic communities involving a rapid and uncontrolled growth. Owing to the capacity to produce toxins as secondary metabolites, cyanobacteria may cause huge economic losses in the fishing and aquaculture industries and poisoning incidents to humans due to their accumulation in the food chain. The conditions which promote toxic blooms have not yet been fully understood, but climate change and anthropogenic intervention are pointed as significant factors. For the detection of toxins in edible marine organisms, the establishment of international regulations and compulsory surveillance has been probed as exceptionally effective. However, not regulation nor monitoring have been settled concerning emergent marine toxins. In the light of this scenario, it becomes essential to apply fast and reliable surveillance methodologies for the early detection of cyanobacterial blooms as well as the occurrence of emergent marine toxins. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing has potential to become a powerful diagnostic tool in the fields of food safety and One Health surveillance. This culture-independent approach overcomes limitations of traditional microbiological techniques; it allows a quick and accurate assessment of a complex microbial community, including quantitative identification and functional characterisation, in a single experiment. In the framework of the EU-FORA fellowship, with the final goal of evaluate metagenomics as a promising risk assessment tool, the fellow worked on the development of an innovative workflow through state-of-the-art molecular and chemical analytical procedures. This work programme aims to evaluate the occurrence of emergent marine toxins and the producing organisms in Cabo Verde coastal cyanobacteria blooms. Our results show the outstanding potential of a holistic metagenomic approach for the risk assessment of emergent marine toxins and the producing organisms. Additionally, we have also highlighted its value for the identification and evaluation of secondary metabolites as natural bioactive compounds with biotechnological and industrial interest.

TI  - Experimental investigation of breakwater-type WEC composed of both stationary and floating pontoons
AB  - Improving the energy conversion performance, especially in shorter waves, may enhance the competitiveness of wave energy converters (WECs) deployed at sea with medium wave conditions. In this paper, a novel system consisting of a front oscillating buoy type WEC and a rear fixed pontoon is proposed to improve the energy conversion performance of the original single pontoon breakwater -type WEC system by Ning et al. (2016). For the purpose of comparison, the experiments for both single pontoon system and two-pontoon system are conducted. Note that, to avoid the significant increase of the construction cost, the total pontoon volume (i.e., the displacement of the pontoon) of the proposed system remains the same with that of the single pontoon system. The two-pontoon system with different draft ratios d1/d2 (where d1 and d2 are the draft of the front pontoon and rear pontoon) are considered. The experiment shows that the system with smaller draft ratio gives more excellent energy conversion performance. The current controller-magnetic powder brake system is selected and used as the power take-off (PTO) system. The characteristics of the PTO system are investigated, which shows that the approximate Coulomb damping force can be simulated very well. The results also reveal that the proposed breakwater-type WEC with proper configuration improves the capture width ratio (CWR) effectively without compromising the coastal protection performance (i.e., the transmission coefficient KT &lt; 0.5) in comparison with the single pontoon system. And the effective frequency range for the transmission coefficient (KT &lt; 0.5) and CWR (Î· &gt; 20%) can be broadened by improving the CWR in shorter waves. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Modular multilevel converter (MMC) based flexible direct current transmission technology is an important scheme for the power transmission of distant offshore wind farm, but it presents multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) characteristics. The frequency coupling effect of MIMO characteristics poses a new challenge to the stability of the offshore wind farm-MMC interconnection system. Most of the existing MMC models have ignored the frequency coupling effect, and there are few studies on the key mechanism affecting the frequency coupling effect. In view of the above problems, this paper establishes the equivalent sequence impedance model of MMC on the wind field side, including the frequency coupling effect, and analyzes and evaluated the key factors affecting the frequency coupling effect and stability. Meanwhile, an improved MIMO stability criterion based on Gershgorin-circle theorem is proposed to solve the complicated problem of the existing stability criterion, which simplifies the stability judgment process by introducing the distance function. Then, based on the criterion, the influence of the key factors and the frequency coupling effect on the stability of the system is analyzed, and the conservatism of the criterion is analyzed quantitatively. Finally, a simulation example is given to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis. Â© 2021 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.

TI  - Dissolved organic carbon sorption dynamics in tidal marsh soils
AB  - Coastal wetlands are significant sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to adjacent waters and, consequently, exert a strong influence on the quantity and quality of DOC exported to the coastal oceans. Our understanding of the factors that control the exchange of DOC at the tidal marsh-estuarine interface, however, remains limited. We hypothesize that tidal marsh soils act as a regulator and that their physical characteristics, such as organic carbon content and mineral phase composition, are key controls on DOC exchange between soil surfaces and both surface and interstitial waters. To test this hypothesis, we generated traditional Langmuir sorption isotherms using anaerobic batch incubations of four tidal wetland soils, representing a range of soil organic carbon content (1.77\% +/- 0.12\% to 36.2\% +/- 2.2\%) and salinity regimes (freshwater to mixoeuhaline), across four salinity treatments. Results suggest that the maximum soil sorption capacity and DOC binding affinity increase and decrease with greater salinity, respectively, though the enhancement of maximum soil sorption capacity is somewhat mitigated in soils richer in poorly crystalline iron minerals. Initial natively sorbed organic carbon showed a significant positive correlation with soil specific surface area and K showed a moderate yet significant positive correlation with poorly crystalline iron mineral content. Taken together, these results point to a strong mineralogical control on tidal marsh sorption dynamics and a complex physicochemical response of those dynamics to salinity in tidal marsh soils.

TI  - Impacts of land use changes on carbon stocks, greenhouse gas, and carbon economic value of agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector in coastal area of yi san sub-district, Samut Songkhram province, Thailand between 2001 and 2015
AB  - The objectives of this research were to 1) study changes in land use of Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector using GIS application as a tool for accounting land use type area for each given periods, 2) to estimate the amount of carbon stocks, and carbon dioxide emissions and removals from changes of 6 land use types (mangrove forest, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, and aquaculture land) which were evaluated under the standard method of the 2006 IPCC Guideline for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, and 3) to evaluate the economic value of carbon dioxide based on existing carbon price in California Carbon Market. The result showed that between 2001 and 2015 in Yi San Sub-district, Samut Songkhram Province, different types of land use were changed from aquaculture to mangrove forest (974.37 ha), followed by mangrove forest to aquaculture (770.75 ha), respectively. Mangrove forests increased in carbon stocks due to biomass growth of 50,730.63 tC and the large proportions of decrease in carbon stocks in biomass were from aquaculture land as -21,735.14 tC. The estimation of total carbon dioxide emissions was +123,043.83 tCO2 and total carbon dioxide removals were -190,409.73 tCO2. The land use with the highest carbon dioxide emission was the aquaculture land (+81,696.64 tCO2), followed by the grassland (+35,058.26 tCO2) and settlements (+5,509.30 tCO2), respectively. The land use with the highest amount of carbon dioxide removal was the mangrove forest (-186,012.28 tCO2), followed by the cropland (-2,257.41 tCO2) and grassland (-2,140.04 tCO2), respectively. The highest gain of economic value from CO2 removals was the mangrove forest (2,808,785.43 USD) followed by cropland (22,314.48 USD). The highest economic loss from CO2 emissions was the aquaculture land (1,233,619.26 USD) followed by the grassland (497,065.12 USD) and settlements (83,190.43 USD), respectively. As a result, those land use changes can reduce global warming potential (GWP) up to -67,365.90 tCO2e and increase the net total carbon economic value as 1,017,225.09 USD.

TI  - A waste cryogenic energy assisted freshwater generator for marine applications
AB  - The scarcity of freshwater resources in the marine environment drives advancement of conventional desalination technologies. It is appealing to recover waste thermal energy to power desalination process. With the fast expansion of the global fleet of liquefied natural gas (LNG) powered vessels and the number of LNG terminals, it is envisaged that LNG cryogenic energy becomes an important form of waste thermal energy apart from engine exhaust. A freshwater generator assisted by LNG cryogenic energy is proposed and investigated in the paper. A semi-dynamic model of the proposed system is used to predict performance and optimal parameters. Feed-in seawater, cooling medium, and configurations of the evaporator and the condenser are three key factors to influence the freshwater production rate and required cryogenic energy. The optimal design is able to provide 1021.7 kg/h freshwater from feed-in seawater of 1296 kg/h and LNG evaporation of 3150 kg/h. A scenario study on an LNG powered cruise ferry predicted that freshwater of 16,991 kg is generated in the 48-hour voyage with the fluctuating LNG cryogenic energy from evaporation, which varies between 212 kW and 973 kW.

TI  - Variabilities of the carbon storage of mangroves in Gili Meno Lake, North Lombok District, Indonesia
AB  - Mangrove is one of the coastal vegetation that can act as carbon mitigation (carbon sink and carbon storage). This study aims to determine the potential for carbon sinks and storage in the leaves and roots of each type of mangrove found in Gili Meno lake, North Lombok, Indonesia. The research includes the identification of species and sampling (leaves and roots) of mangroves in the research quadrant. The organic carbon content of mangrove leaves and roots was tested using the Wakley and Black method. The results showed that there were 5 (five) types of mangroves in Gili Meno lake, namely: Avicennia marina, Lumnitzera racemosa, Bruguiera cylindrica, Rhizophora apiculata, and Excoecaria agallocha. The highest leaf tissue carbon content value was R. apiculata at 45.85%C or equivalent to 3.19 g.C, while in roots, A. marina was 50.06%C, equivalent to 4.49 g.C. In addition, the potential carbon stock in the leaves of the entire mangrove ecosystem in an area of 3 ha is 762.81 tons.CÂ±199.257 and at the roots is 659.76 tons.CÂ±394.848, while the largest potential carbon stock in leaf organs is the type of mangrove R. apiculata, which is 318.91 tons.C.ha-1. and at the root is the type of mangrove A. marina, amounting to 448.54 tons.C.ha-1. The estimated carbon dioxide uptake by the Gili Meno mangrove leaves is in the range of 130.36 g.CO2-168.27 g.CO2 or with an average of 154.34 g.CO2Â±14.376, while the species with the highest carbon dioxide absorption capacity is R. apiculata (268.27 g.CO2) and the lowest in the species of L. racemosa (130.36 g.CO2).

TI  - Analyzing the performance ofwave-energy generator systems (SSG) for the Southern Coasts of Iran, in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea
AB  - The Sea-wave Slot-cone Generator (SSG) wave-energy device is a type of electric energy converting structure that converts energy from sea waves, and which is designed and installed based on wave-overtopping in areas. Most of the previous studies have evaluated SSG systems based on hypothetical waves, considering the system geometry variations. However, it is important to consider the real wave conditions. This paper presents the results of a numerical study to investigate the performances of an SSG system in the context of the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea, where there is a strong need for renewable energies. The computational fluid dynamic (CFD) code Flow-3D was applied. First of all, available experimental data were applied to calibrate and evaluate the accuracy of the numerical model. Then, the real wave conditions on the coasts of the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea were imposed on the JONSWAP spectrum for the numerical modeling. Results of the study demonstrated that the hydraulic efficiency of the SSG system in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea was low for wave heights lower than 0.5 m. The nominal efficiency of the system was relatively more than 60% for wave heights higher than 1 m; thus, the performance of the SSG system was suitably evaluated. Finally, the numerical results demonstrated that the most optimal conditions, with a nominal efficiency of 97%, were obtained for incident waves that had a height of 2 m and a period of 5.6 s. In this case, the hydraulic performance of the system was maximum. Â© 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Maximum output optimal control of wind farm based on wake effect
AB  - At present, the maximum wind energy capture scheme is widely used in single wind turbine while the whole wind farm fails to realize the maximum output for neglecting the wake effect, so it is necessary to put forward a new optimal control scheme for the maximum output of wind farm with considering wake effect. This paper adopts the Park wake model and mainly studies the power allocation optimization strategy for wind farm, which adjusts wind turbine axial inducer under wake effect by using interior point method, thus can coordinates and optimizes the active power of wind turbine. The corresponding control strategy is set up for the different wind speed region, thus the basic framework of the optimal control scheme is constructed. The concrete idea of the scheme is given, and taking Jiangsu offshore wind farm as example, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified through compared with the traditional maximum wind energy capture scheme.

TI  - Sensitivity to the use of 3DVAR data assimilation in a mesoscale model for estimating offshore wind energy potential. A case study of the Iberian northern coastline
AB  - In this work, the WRF meteorological model is run in three different modes to estimate the wind energy potential in the Bay of Biscay for the 1990â€“2001 period. The first simulation (NODA) involves a typical use of the WRF model and it does not use data assimilation. The second one (12hDA) performs 3DVAR data assimilation at 00 UTC and 12 UTC. Finally, 6hDA uses 3DVAR data assimilation at 00 UTC, 06 UTC, 12 UTC and 18 UTC. Verification for the three simulations has been carried out at a preliminary stage using wind data from buoys, and then a spatially distributed analysis has been conducted of surface wind based on satellite data from the Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform (CCMP). To that purpose, the spatial correlation and error patterns over our study area have been used as statistical indicators. The results indicate that the wind values obtained with data assimilation every six hours (6hDA) yield the best verification scores at a 95% confidence level, thereby being the most accurate at reproducing wind observations in the area. Regarding the estimation of wind energy potential, at a second stage, we tested the calculation's sensitivity to the use of data assimilation. The most reliable simulation with data assimilation (6hDA) estimates 21% less energy potential than the simulation without data assimilation. In the absence of historical wind observation records of the sea with sufficient time and space resolution, meteorological models such as WRF provide an estimation of the wind values in tentative areas for offshore wind farms. In this line, our study highlights the need to use meteorological models with data assimilation, as future wind energy production can then be more realistically estimated beforehand. This may also contribute to a more accurate economic and technical evaluation of the risks and benefits for future investments in offshore wind energy. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Control development and performance evaluation for battery/flywheel hybrid energy storage solutions to mitigate load fluctuations in all-electric ship propulsion systems
AB  - Current trends in both commercial and military ship development have focused on ship electrification. A challenge for electric-ship propulsion systems, however, is large propulsion-load fluctuations. To address this issue, this paper explores a new solution, namely a combined battery and flywheel (B/FW) hybrid energy storage system (HESS) as a buffer to isolate load fluctuations from the shipboard network. Our two main objectives, power-fluctuation compensation and energy saving under various operating constraints, are formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. Pareto fronts, which illustrate the trade-offs between the main objectives, are obtained by using dynamic programming with the weighted sum method. To quantitatively analyze the performance of B/FW HESS, a comparative study is performed under different sea conditions, where a battery/ultra-capacitor (B/UC) HESS configuration is used as a reference in performance evaluation. Simulation results show the feasibility and effectiveness of B/FW to mitigate the load fluctuations for all-electric ships, especially at high sea states. Furthermore, a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is developed to facilitate real-time implementation of the proposed solution. A performance comparison between the proposed MPC energy management strategy and the global dynamic programming is performed, and this comparison demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed MPC strategy.

TI  - Deep offshore slim hole drilling
AB  - This paper describes means of porting the Slim Hole Drilling concept to deep offshore applications. Slim Hole technology is now routinely used onshore. Positive results have been proven in terms of cost reduction, minimisation of the environmental impact of drilling activity, drilling efficiency and safety and quality of geological evaluation. Presently in conventional drilling, offshore units are mostly operating at water depths less than 1,500m. Increasing the water depths for these units is costly and difficult. One alternative is to consider slim Hole drilling. In fact the technological barriers initially raised by Slim Hole drilling for kick detection and kick control, mechanical behaviour of the drillstring and rheological behaviour of the mud are now completely mastered. It is now proven that technology is available today for electric logging and testing in slim hole wells. In addition, onshore experience for more than two years in various countries has shown the clear economical advantages of Slim Hole drilling. The challenge of porting the Slim Hole concept to deep offshore applications is to adapt to floating support, and solve specific problems such as heave compensation, to allow an accurate control of the weight on bit as well as designing a new riser system. This paper reviews different alternatives for drilling equipment to achieve the above challenge, allowing a reduction of the size of the vessels suitable for Slim hole drilling. The ability to adapt Slim Hole drilling to deep offshore drilling will allow oil exploration to 2,000m and beyond, with a significant reduction of costs compared to conventional exploration drilling.

TI  - POWER - a methodology for predicting offshore wind energy resources
AB  - An accurate estimate of the long-term wind speed is essential to site an offshore wind park effectively. Unfortunately measured wind speed data at potential offshore wind farm sites are currently sparse. A major European Commission funded project called `POWER' aims to develop a methodology for predicting the long-term wind resource that does not rely directly on offshore anemometry mast data. Work on the POWER project began in August 1998 and is scheduled to finish in July 2001. This paper presents an overview of POWER and shows how the components of the prediction methodology fit together. It also reports on progress in the project to date and presents some preliminary results.

TI  - Carbon dioxide fluxes of temperate urban wetlands with different restoration history
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange of tidal brackish wetlands and how they may be affected by restoration methods are largely unknown. The New Jersey Meadowlands, a tidal brackish estuary system, have had a long history of pollution, hydrological alterations, multiple restoration and mitigation treatments since the early 1970ies. To understand the effects of restoration, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was measured with the eddy covariance technique in three urban tidal brackish wetland sites over three years: an organic matter amended restored site, a non-amended restored site and a natural (non-restored) wetland site. Our results showed all three sites to be a CO2 source in the wintertime reverting to a weak sink of CO2 in the summer and annually to be sources of CO2 for some of the sites for some of the time. However, the amended restored wetland was found to have the highest release of CO2. Annual destructive harvest of the major species at these wetlands (Spartina ssp and Phragmites australis) did not show significant differences in the aboveground net primary productivity and leaf area over the course of this study. Overall, aboveground biomass production of the three wetlands sites was within the expected range of tidal brackish marshes, but the sites differed in their NEE, ecosystem respiration, and gross ecosystem production. This investigation suggests that CO2 uptake and potential subsequent carbon sequestration may be strongly affected by the management and restoration history of the wetlands, and in our case these wetlands are often acting as a source of CO2, and not as a sink, as may have been expected.

TI  - The coordinated development of offshore energy infrastructure: Legal challenges and possible solutions
AB  - There will be an enormous growth of offshore wind energy generation in the North Sea if current plans are given effect. Standard practice for wind farms constructed to date has been to provide each wind farm with a dedicated cable connection to the onshore transmission system (radial connection). A more efficient approach would be to initiate coordinated projects that involve the clustering of wind farms and consequently allow for shared offshore assets. This could lower the costs and reduce the impacts on the marine environment. However, national regimes currently focus on the installation of radial connections and do not promote the coordinated development of offshore infrastructure. The purpose of this article is to identify the legal barriers to these coordinated projects and to explore what changes could be made to the current regulatory practices of the North Sea states in order to introduce the required coordination between wind energy generation and infrastructure development.

TI  - Assessing the determinants of local acceptability of wind-farm investment: A choice experiment in the Greek Aegean Islands
AB  - This paper aims at analysing the factors, which motivate communities to resist the installation of wind farms in their vicinity. To this end, the choice experiment methodology was employed in communities in two Greek Aegean Islands to assess the determinants of preferences towards different wind-farm projects. Unlike other studies, the willingness to accept welfare measure was adopted. The results of our analysis show that the conservation status of the area where the wind farms are to be installed, along with the governance characteristics of the planning procedure are the most important determinants of local community welfare in relation to wind farms. In contrast to other studies, we find that the physical attributes of wind farms appear to be of less relative importance from a local community welfare point of view. Implications for the EU's future energy policy are drawn. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - CO2 injection into North Sea oil fields will increase oil recovery
AB  - A North Sea Basin Task Force, composed of governments and private and public organizations from the North Sea rim, was established with the aim of developing regulation and management of CO2 storage under the North Sea. Co2 injection potential is being extensively used for UKCS oil fields, for IOR and associated CO2 sequestration, prepared for the UK Department of Trade and Industry. One of the many challenges in the offshore implementation of CO2 injection into oil reservoirs for IOR is the management of Inevitable CO2 back production through producing wells. CO2 credit value is likely to rise in the longer term, while WAG injection costs may fall, if there is more implementation of CO2 injection. The UKCS also has substantial IOR and CO2 sequestration potential from CO2 injection into UKCS oil fields, which is expected to contribute substantially to its value.

TI  - Full size voltage converters for 5MW offshore wind power generators
AB  - Wind turbines equipped with a permanent magnet excited synchronous generator have to be connected to the utility grid via a full-scale converter. They allow windturbines to be utilized at their optimal point of operation and transmit the energy to the grid with a high efficiency. With larger turbine unit sizes, medium-voltage converter systems are most suitable for the corresponding high power. The flexibility of industrial full-scale converter-based systems allows easy adaptation to different operation modes and grid requirements. This paper presents the prototype project of a converter system for the 5 MW class windturbine for the first German offshore wind farm Alpha Ventus,which is located about 60km offshore in the german north sea. It includes a description of the system and measurements during special situations.

TI  - Totora (Schoenoplectus californicus (C.A. Mey.) SojÃ¡k) and its potential as a construction material
AB  - Totora is an emergent macrophyte with properties and historical uses supporting its potential use in contemporary construction and for reducing pressure on conventional forest plantations by diversifying the sources of biomass-based materials. Recent advances in the wood construction field have demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of using wood-based materials in tall building structures and other massive constructive uses, which could lead to a net reduction in COâ‚‚eq emissions from the construction sector by replacing high-energy consuming materials such as concrete or steel with wood and biomass-based materials. Among these biomass-based materials are non-timber forest products. This category includes plants that can provide important contributions to the construction sector by diversifying the sources of biomass-based materials. One of these plants is totora (Schoenoplectus californicus (C.A. Mey.) SojÃ¡k). Totora is a bulrush that grows in lakes and marshes in the Americas, from California to Chile, and some of the Pacific islands. This bulrush has been used by many cultures as medicine, food, forage, and material for building houses, boats, and different handicrafts. Although several people still use totora to make their handicrafts and rafts, the most important current examples of the use of totora are the floating islands of the Uros in Lake Titicaca. The Uros people have developed traditional techniques for building their homes, boats, and even the artificial islands where they live, with methods based almost exclusively on the totora culms. The studies and experimentation conducted on this plant have underscored its fast growth capacity, high yield values, anatomical and physical properties, and potential environmental benefits. This review aims to analyze the available data on this material regarding its potential for construction, which is intended to foster its research and development as an alternative source of a biomass-based building material.

TI  - A Markovian approach to power generation capacity assessment of floating wave energy converters
AB  - The significant cost required for implementation of WEC sites and the uncertainty associated with their performance, due to the randomness of the marine environment, can bring critical challenges to the industry. This paper presents a probabilistic methodology for predicting the long-term power generation of WECs. The developed method can be used by the operators and designers to optimize the performance of WECs by improving the design or in selecting optimum site locations. A Markov Chain model is constructed to estimate the stationary distribution of output power based on the results of hydrodynamic analyses on a point absorber WEC. To illustrate the application of the method, the performance of a point absorber is assessed in three locations in the south of Tasmania by considering their actual long-term sea state data. It is observed that location 3 provides the highest potential for energy extraction with a mean value for absorbed power of approximately 0.54MW, while the value for locations 1 and 2 is 0.33MW and 0.43MW respectively. The model estimated that location 3 has the capacity to satisfy industry requirement with probability 0.72, assuming that the production goal is to generate at least 0.5MW power. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Study on power input model for active blade pitch control of a vertical-axis tidal current turbine
AB  - On the basis of optimization results developed by previous work of variable pitch turbine, this paper studies the influence of power input on the active pitch control turbine performance. A mathematical model is proposed by using the Dâ€™Alembert principle to help solve force equilibrium formula of single blade, then calculation of the power input that make the turbine blade pitch obey certain laws is obtained. The commercial software STAR-CCM+ is used to simulate the net output power of blade pitch turbine. The net power output of the turbine is figured out and the results of different tip speed ratio (TSR) are compared. Results of two models show that for low TSR, the net power coefficient of the active blade pitch turbine obviously lower than power coefficient owing to high angular velocity; for high TSR, the difference between net power coefficient and power coefficients of the active control pitch turbine is dominated by input momentum. It is concluded that the impact of power input on active pitch control turbine should not be ignored in some operating conditions.

TI  - Wavepod a transmission for wave energy converters - set-up and testing
AB  - Marine wave energy is expected to play a significant role in future energy production. A range of converter types has been proposed, some of which have been tested, but none have achieved economic feasibility yet. Partly this is due to transmissions, which are too expensive, not reliable enough or too poor in terms of efficiency. A new system has been developed by a consortium consisting of Bosch Rexroth, Aquamarine Power and the Institute for Fluid Power Drives and Controls (IFAS) of RWTH Aachen University. The consortium aims to solve these problems by developing an off the-shelf standardised hydraulic transmission or power-take-off. It is called WavePOD. WavePOD provides improved flexibility for adjusting to different wave conditions without requiring customised components or fast control response times. An 8\% scaled power test rig was built and commissioned for operation at IFAS in November 2014. In the first step multiple tests will be carried out to show proof of concept, efficiency and reliability until end of March 2015. In this paper basic criteria for the design of WavePOD will be explained, leading to an explanation of the system. The test rig will then be presented together with intended tests and first results.

TI  - Reception on Nantucket Sound? A summary of current offshore wind farm litigation and a federal legislative proposal taking cues from cellular tower legislation
AB  - In 2002, Cape Wind Associates sought to build a temporary scientific measurement tower on Nantucket Sound. The purpose of this tower was to test the feasibility of the area as a site for an offshore wind farm. The proposed farm would contain one hundred and seventy windmills located at least three miles from the shoreline. The projected energy production from the farm is 420 megawatts, approximately the amount of power used by the entirety of Cape Cod and its surrounding islands. Though wind power is an acknowledged clean source of energy, the erecting of the measurement tower and the completion of the project have been opposed at every turn. Multiple rationales are cited by the opposition, and they have already taken Cape Wind to Federal District Court twice. Judge Tauro, who has presided over both issues brought before the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, has predicted a protracted struggle over the erecting of the wind farm in both decisions he has handed down on the matter. This comment will explore those opinions and, in light of the possibility of a long court struggle, make comparisons to the issues and legislation dealing with the erection of cellular towers across the nation. The aim of this comment is to advocate the passage of federal legislation on offshore wind power, resulting in reduced judicial intervention in the conflicts that will inevitably arise.

TI  - Biological processes for mitigation of greenhouse gases
AB  - Biological processes driven by photosynthesis cycle through the atmosphere well over an order of magnitude more CO2 than is currently emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels. Already human activities control and appropriate almost half the primary photosynthetic productivity of the planet. Better management of natural and man-made ecosystems affords many opportunities for mitigation of greenhouse gases, through sink enhancements, source reductions and substitution of fossil fuels with biofuels. Biofuels can be recovered from most organic wastes, from agricultural and forestry residues, and from biomass produced solely for energy use. However, the currently low costs of fossil fuels limits the markets for biofuels. Accounting for the greenhouse gas mitigation value of biofuels would significantly increase their contribution to world fuel supplies, estimated to be currently equivalent to about 15\% of fossil fuel usage. Another limiting factor in expanding the use of biofuels is the relatively low solar energy conversion efficiencies of photosynthesis. Currently well below 1\% of solar energy is converted into biomass energy even by intensive agricultural or forestry systems, with peak conversion efficiencies about 2 to 3 \% for sugar cane or microalgae cultures. One approach to increase photosynthetic efficiencies, being developed at the University of California Berkeley, is to reduce the amount of light-gathering chlorophyll in microalgae and higher plants. This would reduce mutual shading and also increase photosynthetic efficiencies under full sunlight intensities. Estimates of the potential of photosynthetic greenhouse mitigation processes vary widely. However, even conservative estimates for biofuels substituting for fossil fuels project the potential to reduce a large fraction of current increases in atmospheric CO2 levels. Biofuels production will require integration with existing agronomic, forestry and animal husbandry systems, and improved utilization-conversion processes. The diffuse nature of biomass resources requires relatively small-scale processes for their utilization as solid fuels or conversion to liquid and gaseous fuels. Earlier proposals for enormous energy plantations feeding large power plants, or for establishing huge ocean kelp farms, were impractical. As are some recent ``geoengineering{'' proposals, such as ocean fertilization. In biomass utilization, combustion is generally preferable to more complex processes, such as thermal or biochemical conversions to oils and alcohols. The co-firing of biomass in fossil power plants avoids many of the scale, procurement, and efficiency limitations of stand-alone systems and provides significant near-term opportunities for CO2 mitigation. Landfill gas recovery, due to the large greenhouse gas forcing of methane gas, is another currently available technology that can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Wastes and residues provide many opportunities for biofuels production and CO2 mitigation. Mitigating global warming with biological processes requires overcoming many scientific, technological, financial, institutional, regulatory and, perhaps most important, environmental barriers. This necessitates a major, world-wide and long-term, sustained research, development and implementation effort.

TI  - Comparison of Methods for Estimating Short-Term Extreme Response of Wave Energy Converters
AB  - Short-term extreme response statistics are often required to obtain the long-term (deployment life) response for an offshore structure. A number of methods are available to produce these response statistics for data collected from either physical experimentation or numerical modeling. Here, we consider the application of a series of such methods to determine the short-term extreme response statistics for a simple wave energy converter (WEC). Using data created from a frequency-domain model, each method is implemented multiple times to provide an understanding of its accuracy and variance. The results are compared along with an empirical ``truth{''} result that uses all of the available data. Trade-offs between the amount of data required by a given method and its accuracy are presented and discussed.

TI  - Soil greenhouse gas fluxes in tropical mangrove forests and in land uses on deforested mangrove lands
AB  - Mangrove forests are important carbon sinks in the tropics, yet tropical mangrove deforestation and land use conversion still persists. Reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from natural and anthropogenic sources in wetlands are important in regional and national emissions inventories. However, very few studies have been conducted to measure on the GHG fluxes in coastal wetlands, particularly in mangrove forest and non-forest land uses in deforested mangroves. We investigated the soil fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O in mangrove forest and non-forest land uses on deforested mangrove areas (i.e. abandoned aquaculture ponds, coconut plantations, abandoned salt ponds, and cleared mangroves) in the coasts of Honda Bay, Philippines. Results showed that the emissions of CO2 and CH4 were higher by 2.6 and 6.6 times in mangrove forests (110 and 0.6 kg CO2e ha âˆ’ 1 day âˆ’ 1, respectively) while N2O emissions were lower by 34 times compared to the average of non-forest land uses (1.3 kg CO2e ha âˆ’ 1 day âˆ’ 1). CH4 and N2O emissions accounted for 0.59% and 0.04% of the total emissions in mangrove forest as compared to 0.23% and 3.07% for non-forest land uses, respectively. Site-scale soil GHG flux distribution could be mapped with 75% to 83% accuracy using Ordinary Kriging. Unlike mangroves that can offset all GHG emissions through CO2 uptake from photosynthesis, the non-forest land uses cannot offset their emissions on-site as they are usually devoid of vegetation. Our results could be utilised in higher tier national GHG inventories, to refine regional and global estimates of GHG emissions in mangrove wetlands, and improve policy on coastal wetlands conservation.

TI  - Intelligent Wind Turbine Unit with Tandem Wind Rotors Applicable to Offshore Wind Farm (Profiles and Performances as Tandem Wind Rotors)
AB  - The authors invented the superior wind turbine unit, which is composed of the tandem wind rotors and the double rotational armature type peculiar generator without the traditional stator. It was verified experimentally, at the previous ISOPE conferences, that the output of this unit is higher than the output of the conventional wind turbine and that the rear wind rotor plays very important role to improve the performances of the tandem wind rotors. Continuously, this paper discusses the effect of the blade profiles of the wind rotors on the output characteristics and investigates the acoustic noise from the wind rotors. The field tests were also started preliminarily using the proto type unit composed of the front wind rotor of 2 in, the rear wind rotor of 1.33 m, and the double rotational armature type synchronous generator which are boarded on a pickup vehicle.

TI  - A novel hybrid MCDM approach for offshore wind farm site selection: A case study of Iran
AB  - The multi criteria decision making (MCDM) has been applied in Integrated Energy Planning (IEP) and Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) frameworks. In this paper, a novel hybrid MCDM approach based on the fuzzy analytic network process (ANP), fuzzy decision making trail and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and fuzzy elimination and choice expressing the reality (ELECTRE) methodologies is applied to assist in the site selection of offshore wind farm (OWF) as the renewable energy in the IEP and the ICM frameworks. The aim of this study is to find the best site selection of offshore wind farm for four sites (alternatives) in Bandar Deylam on the Persian Gulf in southwest of Iran. Six criteria (depths and heights, environmental issues, proximity to facilities, economic aspects, resource technical levels and culture) and the related sub-criteria are considered to select proper sites for power station of OWF. The fuzzy ANP method is employed for standpoints of the site selection (goal) subject to the criteria and is performed the criteria subject to the sub-criteria. In addition, due to considering the influences of the criterion to another criterion, the fuzzy DEMATEL is employed in criteria and sub-criteria sections. Moreover, the fuzzy ELECTRE is applied to calculate the decision making matrices of sub-criteria to alternatives. The results show that the alternative A3 is the best site of OWF for Bandar Deylam. Then A2, A4 are the best alternatives and finally alternative A1 is the worst site. Also, a sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the robustness of the outcomes of decision making by changing the priorities of the criteria. The results indicate the robustness of this method when the experts' opinions subject to the criteria change. The evaluation criteria and this methodology could be applied to other coastal cities for promoting the progress of ICM towards the goal of sustainability. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Climate change impacts the future offshore wind energy resources in India: Evidence drawn from CORDEX-SA Regional Climate Models
AB  - Harnessing offshore wind energy is a potential solution to meet rising energy demand. Concurrently, exploitable wind energy is susceptible to climate change. In this study, an ensemble of six RCMs derived from Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment - South Asia (CORDEX-SA) regional climate models is created to study future variation of wind speed and wind power density. The variation with respective to the historic time periods is examined for near-future (2020-2046), mid-future (2047-73), and far-future time periods (2074-2099). Two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios, such as RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, are considered for the analysis. The credibility of RCM data is assessed by comparing it with European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) reanalysis dataset which is validated against buoy datasets. Findings reveal that annual mean wind speed in the considered period ranges between 2\% and -8\% in the case of RCP4.5 while it is 7\% and -16\% in the RCP8.5 scenario. Seasonal percentage variation in WPD is between 80\% and -56\% in the RCP4.5 scenario, and it is relatively higher (105\% and -75\%) in the RCP8.5 scenario. By 2099, it is expected that WPD may increase by 10\% and 30\% in the southern coast, whereas 20\% and 40\% decrement is expected near the coast of Gujarat for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. The findings of this study enable stakeholders to harness wind energy in the Indian offshore region. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A novel tri-semicircle shaped submerged breakwater for mitigating wave loads on coastal bridges part I: Efficacy
AB  - Extreme waves generated by hurricanes, together with storm surges, have led to severe damage and even failures in many offshore structures. This paper presents a novel submerged breakwater design suitable for protecting coastal bridges and other infrastructure. The proposed breakwater design is composed of three identical semicircular shells and a rectangular base using the same total volume of construction material as traditional trapezoidal breakwaters. This configuration permits modular construction and quick installation. A high-fidelity numerical wave tank is established to investigate the performance of the new breakwater device under different conditions with varying wave height, water depth, bridge submersion depth, and spacing between the device and the bridge. The extreme wave is simulated using a second-order solitary wave. According to the observation of a typical scenario, based on the numerical simulations, where waves pass over the novel breakwater and then impact the bridge, it is argued that the new design demonstrates an increased effectiveness to dissipate wave energy. Through analysis of the horizontal and vertical wave forces impacting the T-girder bridge deck, the wave loads are shown to be consistently reduced under all parametric studies. Moreover, it is found that the new breakwater offers improved protection when contrasted with the traditional trapezoidal geometry. The work conducted in this study sheds light on the design of high performing submerged breakwater for mitigating wave loads on coastal bridges. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Coping with a Growing Mobility Demand in a Growing City: Hamburg as Pilot Region for Electric Mobility
AB  - Hamburg, Germany's second largest city and economic centre of Northern Germany, features a high level of cargo handling and port-originated surface transport leading to the respective burden for air quality. Both demographic growth as well as common changes in age structure increase and change the associated mobility needs. The resulting demand for new mobility systems, the vicinity to large offshore wind power sources as well as existing technology clusters constitute the ideal test bed for electric transport applications combined with innovative mobility solutions to cope with these challenges. The city was thus selected as a pilot region for the demonstration and market introduction of electric mobility systems from the German federal government, which provides a total of 500 million euros from the Second Economic Stimulus Package to fund the development and commercialization of electric mobility in eight selected German regions. Between 2009 and 2011 players from academia, industry and local authorities were co-operating closely in projects in order to collect real-life data and hands-on experience with the technology, promote the development of infrastructure and to identify links and barriers to the widespread take-up of electric mobility.

TI  - Long-term assessment of onshore and offshore wind energy potentials of Qatar
AB  - Exploitation of conventional energy resources has caused a deliberate increase in the emitted carbon in the atmosphere, which catalyzes global warming trends. This is a matter of concern, especially in Qatar, where fossil fuels (oil and gas) are largely relied upon for power production. The dependency on such resources could be gradually reduced by utilizing clean and renewable energy. Resource characterization is an important step to evaluate the potentiality of available renewable energy sources. Wind energy is one among them, which has not been assessed reliably so far in Qatar. We analyzed the wind energy potential along the onshore and offshore areas of Qatar using 40 years (1979â€“2018) of hourly wind data extracted from the ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) database. Monthly, seasonal, annual, and decadal mean wind power densities have been derived. Reliability tests have been carried out at select onshore and offshore locations. Trends and inter-annual variability have been assessed. The study reveals that the available wind resources are generally moderate but consistent with no intense trends during the 40 year period. An inter-annual variability in wind power has been identified, which has secured links with the El NiÃ±oâ€“Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Offshore processing plant uses membranes for CO2 removal
AB  - An offshore processing facility in Block A 18 of the Malaysia Thailand Joint Development Area in the Gulf of Thailand has installed Cynara semipermeable membranes to lower the CO2 content in its produced gas. The Cakerawala production platform (CKP) was commissioned in December 2004. In the design, the membrane plant was to deliver 425 MMcfd of sales gas containing 15% CO2 from a feed-gas volume of 700MMcfd and feed CO2 concentration of about 37%. Consisting of two 50% gas-pretreatment trains, the membrane CO2-removal system has trains each consisting of inlet cooling, dehydration that uses desiccant beds, dry-gas filters and gas chilling with mechanical refrigeration. The membrane clusters consist of four separate subtrains in each 50% pretreatment train all operating in parallel. However, the original membranes were replaced in 2005, which improved plant performance. Membrane feed-gas temperature has stabilized above -1Â°C. Only about 1/3 of the new clusters will operate in high-pressure permeate mode; the rest will operate in low-pressure mode. The plant is currently doubling capacity of the CKP facility to 870 MMscfd from 425 MMscfd of sales gas.

TI  - A demonstration of the performance of S2G (Ship to Grid) system in a detached fishing island
AB  - We have demonstrated a newly developed S2G two-way electricity transportation system (from ship to grid and from grid to ship) to prove the effective use of renewable energy for ship propulsion and successful reduction of CO2 emission. This research is conducted under the research program of "Empirical study of the independence distribution energy system technology based on DC technology in a detached island and a fishing village" financed by the Ministry of Environment of Japan subsidy 2014-2016. In this paper, the following results are shown. To conduct the research, a plug-in hybrid electric fishing boat (50 kW electric motor, 140 kW diesel engine with a 10kW generator and a 20 kWh Li-ion battery system) was prepared, named PHEB-2, developed under collaboration research between Osaka City University and the Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc. One electric vehicle (total battery of 20 kWh) was also used to transport the electric energy obtained by the solar cell power line (the grid) with the Li-ion 46 kWh battery system to the boat as the normal G2S operation. The PHEB-2 can also generate electricity so that the electric energy can be supplied from the boat to the grid via the electric vehicle when natural disasters happen. It is proved that the newly developed S2G system worked successfully using high efficiency DC-DC converters. It is shown that the transportation efficiency of the S2G system from the ship to the grid and vice versa was kept at 90 %. It is also quantitatively shown that the plug-in hybrid boat (PHEB) provides an outstanding CO2 reduction of more than 80 % compared with the simple diesel engine operation when a professional fixed position fishing pattern at the research island (Nushima, Hyogo, Japan) was conducted. The population of Nushima is 500 and the number of fishing boats is 162. The remarkable reduction of oil consumption is due to the high efficiency of the electric motor and the good performance of the idling stop function of the electric motor propulsion during fixed fishing operation.

TI  - Atmospheric consequences of disruption of the ocean thermocline
AB  - Technologies utilizing vertical ocean pipes have been proposed as a means to avoid global warming, either by providing a source of clean energy, increasing ocean carbon uptake, or storing thermal energy in the deep ocean. However, increased vertical transport of water has the capacity to drastically alter the ocean thermocline. To help bound potential climate consequences of these activities, we perform a set of simulations involving idealized disruption of the ocean thermocline by greatly increasing vertical mixing in the upper ocean. We use an Earth System Model (ESM) to evaluate the likely thermal and hydrological response of the atmosphere to this scenario. In our model, increased vertical transport in the upper ocean decreases upward shortwave and longwave radiation at the top-of-the-atmosphere due primarily to loss of clouds and sea-ice over the ocean. This extreme scenario causes an effective radiative forcing of â‰ˆ15.5-15.9 W m-2, with simulations behaving on multi-decadal time scales as if they are approaching an equilibrium temperature â‰ˆ8.6-8.8 Â°C higher than controls. Within a century, this produces higher global mean surface temperatures than would have occurred in the absence of increased vertical ocean transport. In our simulations, disruption of the thermocline strongly cools the lower atmosphere over the ocean, resulting in high pressure anomalies. The greater land-sea pressure contrast is found to increase water vapour transport from ocean to land in the lower atmosphere and therefore increase global mean precipitation minus evaporation (P-E) over land; however, many high latitude regions and some low latitude regions experience decreased P-E. Any real implementation of ocean pipe technologies would damage the thermal structure of the ocean to a lesser extent than simulated here; nevertheless, our simulations indicate the likely sign and character of unintended atmospheric consequences of such ocean technologies. Prolonged application of ocean pipe technologies, rather than avoiding global warming, could exacerbate long-term warming of the climate system. Â© 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - BACH ARRAY LINEAR GENERATOR FOR WAVE ENERGY CONVERTERS
AB  - linear generators have been proposed as a proper power takeoff system for direct-drive wave energy conversion. Coupled directly to a reciprocating wave energy device, it was declared that linear generators could be a valuable replacement for hydraulic and pneumatic systems. In this paper, the design and performance evaluation of permanent magnet linear generator that implements Halbach array arrangement is established. The designed generator is suitable for direct energy extraction from sea waves at small wave amplitude. The electromagnetic design is performed using finite element method and space harmonic analysis. A comparative study is performed between Halbach array and conventional air-cored linear generators to show the effectiveness of the proposed design. The equivalent circuit based model is utilized to investigate the dynamic performance of the Halbach array generator. The simulated dynamic performance of the designed generator clarifies that the implementation of Halbach array arrangement would improve energy extraction and voltage waveform. Â© 2015.

Bill Cattanach, head of the Pilot secretariat, part of the UK Government's Department of Energy and Climate Change. Wells are starting to lose pressure, water is starting to come in to wells. Consideration of asset management has led Shell to gradually reduce the scale of its assets offshore in the SNS over the years. Shell's strategy is also reducing what is infield. It is called decomplexing. Up-time is better because the more kit there is, the more it breaks down, the more leaks one has. Inspection activity is key to asset integrity, but it is expensive and time consuming, especially when one has to build scaffolding or put people on ropes.

TI  - Integration of solid oxide fuel cells in cruise ship energy systems
AB  - The growing trend of the cruise ship industry, together with increasing concerns over its impact on the environment, makes these ships a much relevant target for the efforts toward increasing ship energy efficiency, thus ultimately reducing fuel consumption and emissions of carbon dioxide and other air pollutants. In a context of rising discussions concerning the use of cleaner fuels such as LNG and methanol in shipping, fuel cells are expected to become an increasingly viable solution for onboard power generation. In particular, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) can offer high electrical efficiency, power density and reliability with the possibility of combined heat, hydrogen and power production, which make them suitable for energy-intensive applications with a diverse demand (e.g., cruise ships) by integrating other complementary technologies. In this paper, we investigate the potential for energy and emission savings in relation to the use of SOFCs on cruise ships. Given the limited ability of SOFCs to deal with fast load changes and start/stop cycles, the SOFCs are expected to tackle the baseload, while a combination of batteries and internal combustion engines are complementary for handling peak loads. The proposed system is tested and optimized for a case study of a cruise ship operating in the Baltic Sea. Based on reference operational profiles for heat and electricity demand, the design of the system is optimized. The system proves particularly performant, with an overall efficiency close to 70% and a potential lifetime economic performance in line with conventional systems powered by Diesel engines.

TI  - Experimental and finite element studies of a 250 kW brushless doubly fed induction generator
AB  - This study studies, using experimentally verified finite element (FE) analysis, various performance measures of the brushless doubly fed induction generator (BDFIG) when magnetic wedges are used for closing stator open slots. The BDFIG is an attractive generator solution for offshore wind power and can replace doubly fed slip-ring induction generators. It is shown in this study that the use of magnetic wedges, commonly used in large induction machines, reduces the stator windings magnetising currents in a BDFIG, reflected in the values of magnetising inductances. They also increase the leakage flux in the stator slots, leading to a larger series inductance in the equivalent circuit. The series inductance significantly affects the BDFIG performance as well as the rating of its converter. The effects of magnetic wedges on BDFIG air-gap flux, synchronous torque, and stator tooth top saturation is also investigated. Two-dimensional FE analysis of an experimental 250 kW BDFIG is used in this study, verified by experimental measurements.

In this study, an innovative microbial reverse-electrodialysis electrolysis cell (MREC), which combines the strengths of reverse electrodialysis (RED) and microbial electrosynthesis technology platforms, was developed to achieve efficient CO2-to-value chemicals bioconversion by using the salinity gradient energy as driven energy sources. In the MREC, maximum acetate and ethanol concentrations of 477.5 Â± 33.2 and 46.2 Â± 8.2 mg Lâˆ’1 were obtained at the cathode, catalyzed by Sporomusa ovata with production rates of 165.79 Â± 11.52 and 25.11 Â± 4.46 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1, respectively. Electron balance analysis indicates that 94.4 Â± 3.9% of the electrons derived from wastewater and salinity gradient were recovered in acetate and ethanol.

TI  - A Composite Permeable Sloping Seawall for Effective Energy Dissipation: A Quasi-Soft Alternative Solution for Shore Protection
AB  - The recent trend in coastal research centers around environmental sustainability, especially in coastal conservation. A seawall typically has three layers, namely core, filter, and hard rubble/concrete armor. In the current study, a two-layered seawall is proposed, comprising a coir geotextile roll from the coastal regions, along with sand encapsulated in a geotextile over an impermeable core. This can be considered as a quasi-soft solution against the traditional, three-layered, hard alternative. The objective of this study is to investigate the combined effect of slope and porosity, of this composite structure, on the wave reflection. The findings show that the composite structure provides less reflection coefficient values compared to traditional rubble mound seawalls. Four orientations and positions of coir rolls with geosynthetic sandbag were tested. The armor layer with coir rolls overlain by geosynthetic sandbags over an impermeable core could be a better alternative, as it increases the hydrodynamic performance by 59\% as compared to sandbags, used alone, over an impermeable core on a slope of 1:2.

TI  - World's first carbon sequestration project in salt caverns built offshore in ultra deep water in Brazil
AB  - In 2006, giant oil fields were discovered in Brazil in a water depth of ~ 2200 m and under a caprock of 2000 m of continues salt rock overlaying the reservoirs, called pre-salt. Currently more than a half of the Brazilian oil and gas production comes from these reservoirs. However, some of these assets have big Oil & Gas ratio with a high level of CO2 contamination, which are currently being reinjected in the reservoirs. This procedure gradually increases the CO2 content associated with the oil extracted, reducing well productivity and leading to high costs of CO2 and CH4 separation by the membrane technology. The Research Center for Gas Innovation (RCGI) located at the State University of SÃ£o Paulo in Brasil, sponsored by Shell Brazil, is developing a technology that uses the thick layer of salt rock overlying the pre-salt reservoirs to build caverns where the contaminated gas will be injected and decontaminated. After 2 years of extensive research, several studies have been carried out to analyze the main critical aspects of the technology in order to evaluate its feasibility, and now it has been decided to advance to the field proof stage. The salt dome studied can accommodate the construction of 15 caverns, thus providing the confinement of approximately 108 million tons of CO2. Before the system be construct in full scale, it was decided to initially build an experimental cavern with smaller size to obtain field parameters of the final design of the caverns. This paper describes this development denominated Offshore Salt Cavern Ultra-deep Water CCS System, that aims to perform the natural gas storage, a natural gravitational separation between CO2 / CH4 inside the caverns, and the confinement of CO2 (CCS). It presents important results related to structural integrity analysis of the giant and experimental caverns, well design using the same methodology applied in more than 200 projects of the pre-salt oil wells, instrumentation plan of the experimental cavern, storage capacities and other relevant data. If the economics proves feasible, this offshore gas storage station will be the first of its kind and possibly the biggest CCS Project in the world. Copyright Â© 2020 ASME

TI  - Analytical Design and Optimization of Flat-Quasi Linear Generator for Sea Wave Power Plant in South Java Ocean
AB  - This paper aimed to find out a model of 1 kW(p) flat-quasi linear permanent magnet generator (LPMG) for ocean wave power plant in South Java Ocean. First, a flat-quasi LPMG is modeled based on the wave characteristic at the placement site. The model was then simulated using finite element software of FEMM 4.2. Next, the model was optimized to find out the optimum output power and cogging force. The optimization was performed by modifying pole's length and number but constant total translator length. The optimized model could generate up to 1,424.65 W-p (6\% higher output power), with 38.85\% lower cogging force than the initial model. The output power was maximum when the load resistance equals 1 Omega. Based on the configuration of the LPMG and wave characteristic, the generator generates power only in certain time. This is due to different size between the wave amplitude and the translation path length. Moreover, the average wave height would be directly proportional to the translation speed, induced voltage, and output power.

TI  - Wave farm layout and coastal impacts
AB  - Understanding the impacts of wave energy exploitation is crucial if it is to develop as a fully-fledged renewable. The objective of this work is to investigate whether the impacts of a wave farm on the nearshore wave conditions change significantly depending on its layout, and if so, in which manner. This investigation is carried out through a wave farm project proposed for NW Spain. The impact resulting from one- and two-row layouts of the farm is compared under different wave conditions representative of the area, leading to twelve case studies. We find that the different layouts do produce substantially different wave conditions immediately behind the farm. The differences in the nearshore for the cases studied are, however, not so large, but could increase if the farm is placed closer to the shoreline.

TI  - Wave energy potential in the north-west of Sardinia (Italy)
AB  - Sardinia (Italy) is the second largest island in the Mediterranean Sea and its economy is penalized by high costs of electricity, which is double compared to the continental Italian regions, and triple compared to the EU average. In this research, the wave energy potential of the north-west of Sardinia has been studied by an analysis of wave measurements carried out in a 20-year period by the Italian Wave Buoys Network (1989-2009) and the corresponding hindcast data by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The annual offshore wave power was found to range between 8.91 kW/m and 10.29 kW/m, the bulk of which is provided by north-westerly waves. The nearshore energetic patterns have been studied by means of a numerical coastal propagation model (Mike21 NSW). The analyses highlight two " hot spots" where the wave power is respectively 9.95 and 10.91 kW/m. For these locations, a Wave Energy Converter with maximum efficiency in the ranges of significant wave heights between 3.5 and 4.5 m (energy periods 9.5-11 s) and 4-6 m (energy periods 9.5-11.5 s) respectively should be selected. In order to find a concrete solution to the problem of harvesting wave energy in this area, the characterization of waves providing energy is considered along with additional considerations, such as installation and operational costs, institutional factors, environmental sensitivity and interferences with others human activities. On the basis of the information available and the identified circumstances, the site of Bosa Marina has been proposed as a prospective wave farm location. For this site in particular, multifunctional structures like harbour or coastal protection breakwaters equipped with a WEC are recommended. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Development of a high-pressure water tunnel facility for ocean CO2 storage experimentation
AB  - Direct introduction of CO2 into the ocean at depths greater than approximately 500 m is a promising storage option for CO2 emitted from energy production and use. A High-Pressure Water Tunnel Facility (HWTF) is being developed at the National Energy Technology Laboratory to permit experimental observations on objects such as CO2 drops, hydrate particles or hydrate-covered CO2 drops to be made without contact with materials other than seawater. The HWTF employs a countercurrent flow of water and special design features that provide for radial and axial stabilization to allow the observation of buoyant objects in a windowed test section. The status of experimental and theoretical efforts associated with the construction of the HWTF are described.

TI  - Sediment microbes mediate the impact of nutrient loading on blue carbon sequestration by mixed seagrass meadows
AB  - Recent studies have reported significant variability in sediment organic carbon (SOC) storage capacity among seagrass species, but the factors driving this variability are poorly understood, limiting our ability to make informed decisions about which seagrass types are optimal for carbon offsetting and why. Here we show that differences in SOC storage capacity among species within the same geomorphic environment can be explained (in part) by below-ground processes in response to nutrient load; specifically, differences in the activity of microbes harboured by morphologically-different seagrass species. We found that increasing nutrient load enhanced the relative contribution of seagrass and algal sources to SOC pools, boosting sediment microbial biomass and extracellular enzyme activity within mixed seagrass meadows composed of Thalassia hemprichii and Enhalus acoroides, and thus possibly weaken the seagrass blue carbon sequestration capacity. The relative contribution of seagrass plant material to sediment bacterial organic carbon (BOC) and the influencing SOC-decomposing enzymes in E. acoroides meadows were half that of T. hemprichii meadows living side-by-side, even though the mixed seagrass meadows received SOC from the same sources. Overall this research suggests that microbial activity can vary significantly among seagrass species, thereby causing fine-scale (within-meadow) variability in SOC sequestration capacity in response to nutrient load.

TI  - Comparison of leaf litter decomposition and microbial decomposer communities in fringe and riverine mangroves in French Guiana
AB  - Mangroves are highly productive and changing forests located in the intertidal zone of tropical regions. Leaf litter decomposition represents a substantial part of their carbon sink abilities. Little is known about the potential effect of climate change on this key process of ecosystem functioning. This study compared leaf litter microbial decay between fringe and riverine Avicennia germinans stands. A direct and reciprocal transplant experiment using litterbags was setup in French Guiana to test 3 hypotheses: (i) the activities and abundance of microbial decomposers are lowest in the fringe mangroves due to exposure to saline water and tidal immersion; (ii) for these reasons, litter decomposes faster in riverine stands; and (iii) according to the home-field advantage hypothesis, litter decomposes more rapidly in the environment from which it originates. Remaining litter masses, abundance of litter microbial community (phospholipid fatty acid signatures (PLFA)), and their functional capability (enzyme activities and Biolog) were assessed. Litter directly transplanted in riverine stands showed higher enzymatic activity (+ 77\%), catabolic diversity (+ 10\%), and microbial biomass (+ 60\%) than litter transplanted directly in fringe stands. In contrast, both riverine and fringe derived litter showed faster decay at the fringe (14\% mass loss) than riverine site (4\% mass loss) between 30 and 45 days. Here, environmental conditions associated with different distances from the sea such as salinity and inundation regimes, rather than microbial features are suggested as main factors affecting decomposition process. Expected sea level rise in the coastal Guianas may therefore modify the mangroves productivity in the coming decades.

TI  - Resilience design method based on meta-structure: A case study of offshore wind farm
AB  - The definition and evaluation of resilience has been widely discussed for various systems to reduce risks in dynamic environments. Despite the existence of numerous studies on the definition and evaluation of resilience, very few has established general approaches to system design with resilience criteria. In this paper, we present general methodologies for resilience design based on meta-structure under internal deterioration and external shocks. First, a resilience metric describing the system additional capacity is proposed. Afterwards, one first-level and two second-level meta-structures are introduced to model homogeneous and heterogeneous system units, respectively. Design factors that directly influence the resilience are formulated, and the evaluation method for resilience of meta-structure is given. Considering the proposed resilience measure and meta-structural properties, we construct an approach to system design with various constraints and two novel criteria. Furthermore, in order to explain the effectiveness of proposed novel methodology, we analyzed the resilience characteristics of first- and two second-level meta-structures under deterministic and random damage. Finally, a case study on an offshore wind farm comprising 30 wind turbines is carried out. The result shows that resilience design can ensure the system recovery after a damage by external shocks arriving according to Poisson distribution with rate 1/720. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - 100% renewable energy in Japan
AB  - Low-cost solar photovoltaics and wind offer a reliable and affordable pathway to deep decarbonization of energy, which accounts for three quarters of global emissions. However, large-scale deployment of solar photovoltaics and wind requires space and may be challenging for countries with dense population and high per capita energy consumption. This study investigates the future role of renewable energy in Japan as a case study. A 40-year hourly energy balance model is presented of a hypothetical 100% renewable Japanese electricity system using representative demand data and historical meteorological data. Pumped hydro energy storage, high voltage interconnection and dispatchable capacity (existing hydro and biomass and hydrogen energy produced from curtailed electricity) are included to balance variable generation and demand. Differential evolution is used to find the least-cost solution under various constraints. This study shows that Japan has 14 times more solar and offshore wind resources than needed to supply 100% renewable electricity and vast capacity for off-river pumped hydro energy storage. Assuming significant cost reductions of solar photovoltaics and offshore wind towards global norms in the coming decades driven by large-scale deployment locally and global convergence of renewable generation costs, the levelized cost of electricity is found to be US$86/Megawatt-hour for a solar-dominated system, and US$110/Megawatt-hour for a wind-dominated system. These costs can be compared with 2020 average system prices on the spot market in Japan of US$102/Megawatt-hour. Cost of balancing 100% renewable electricity in Japan ranges between US$20â€“27/Megawatt-hour for a range of scenarios. In summary, Japan can be self-sufficient for electricity supply at competitive costs, provided that the barriers to the mass deployment of solar photovoltaics and offshore wind in Japan are overcome.

TI  - Hydrate reservoirs - Methane recovery and CO2 disposal
AB  - The world over, energy generation technologies such as gas turbines and fuel cells have initiated a migration towards gaseous fuels. A driving force for this trend is the C:H ratio, with the hydrogen component progressively increasing with time. In the ultimate analysis, it suggests a migration towards hydrogen. Meanwhile, the search for viable hydrocarbons continues since their combustion and utilization characteristics are understood. Gas reservoirs of limited significance have been found within the country, for example, coal bed methane and shale gas. Additionally, the prospect of obtaining gas in the long run, from gas hydrate reservoirs may become a reality. Such reservoirs have an added potential of storing large quantities of CO2 in hydrate form. Consequently, technologies from extraction of gas hydrates, energy conversion to an appropriate form all the way to exhaust gas disposal need to be re-visited and developed in the local context. As a start, this study describes a mathematical model of multi-species multi-phase transport in a porous reservoir, based on principles of conservation of mass, momentum and energy. The model equations are discretized and numerically solved to simulate flow and heat transfer in the hydrate reservoir, bounded by a depressurization and an injection well. As seen in the simulation, depressurization extracts methane from the reservoir while CO2 injection enhances the recovery rate largely due to the displacement of CH4 by CO2. At the same time, hydrate formation of CO2 traps it in the reservoir providing additional structural integrity to the marine geological formation. The model, validated on a laboratory scale, needs to be tested under field-scale conditions. Â© Printed in India.

TI  - Optimal planning of hybrid photovoltaic/battery/diesel generator in ship power system
AB  - In line with the increasing concern on the pollution release by marine ships, renewable energy technologies in ships power system has received so much attention. Recently, photovoltaic (PV) and energy storage system (ESS) are been integrated into conventional diesel generator in ships power system Nevertheless, improper sizing of the overall ship power station will result in a high investment cost and increase CO2 emission. This paper devised a methodology to compute the optimal size of the ESS, PV and diesel generator in a ship power system to minimize CO2 emission, fuel cost, and investment cost. It is a well-known fact that power generation in a sailing ship depend on the time zone, local time, date, latitude, and longitude along ship navigation route and the condition of the ship power system also differs from power systems on land. The devised method in this paper takes into accounts the geographical and season variation of solar insolation along the route from Lagos (Nigeria) to Conakry (Guinea) and accurately model the power output of PV modules is along the route.

TI  - Remedial Measures to Alleviate Carbon Emissions and Environmental Impacts of Desalination Systems in Saudi Arabia
AB  - The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is the biggest oil-producing nation in the Gulf region, besides being the largest contributor to carbon emission due to its reliance on oil-based energy and desalinated water for feeding the citizens, industries, and agriculture. Water and energy demands are closely associated; the former requires intensive energy for desalination and the latter demands huge water resources for energy generation. Urban water supply services exploit about six percent of the Kingdomâ€™s electric power. The supply of desalinated water for industrial and agricultural purposes with existing technologies is not sustainable for the economy and environment in a long run. This chapter presents an elaborate summary of the impacts of desalination processes such as brine discharge, dissolved oxygen, heavy metals, coagulants, discharge of air pollutants, damages on the marine ecosystem, noise pollution, carbon emissions, and land use and planning. Further, efficient remedial measures are summarized especially to alleviate carbon emissions and environmental impacts of desalination systems and these measures include technological enhancement in existing desalination techniques, use of brackish water, atmospheric water generation, atmospheric water harvesting using metal-organic frameworks, renewable energy/solarpowered desalination, replacement of thermal evaporation-based desalination plants with more environment-friendly desalination technologies, emerging innovative desalination technologies. Adopting any of the above-mentioned remedial measures considerably reduces the carbon emissions and environmental impacts of desalination systems. More eco-friendly and energy-efficient reverse osmosis-pressure retarded osmosis (RO-PRO) and bio-electrochemical-based desalination technologies such as microbial desalination processes are also elaborated.

In order to reduce the green-house gas emission, renewable energy (such as wind energy, solar energy, fuel cellâ‹¯) will gradually substitute can be installed the primary energy resource (such as coal, oil, scale gasâ‹¯). Based on GIS technique, wind power turbines in the surrounding area of Japanese coast-line. In the study, 2,000 kW rated wind turbines are considered for further installation.

TI  - Sensing and control challenges for Smart Grids
AB  - Due to the adverse impacts of the consumption of fossil fuels on our environment, the quest for a more sustainable energy supply is increasingly intensifying worldwide. Many renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar and tidal power generate electricity. Therefore, the development towards a sustainable energy supply leads to increasing electrification. The decreasing degree of controllability of electricity production and the high, but rare production peaks caused by distributed generation require involving electricity consumption in balancing supply and demand. To this end, electricity networks must develop into Smart Grids. One of the consequences of this trend is a vastly increased need to acquire, process and communicate data, both for measurement and control purposes. In the contribution, first the background of the development towards Smart Grids will be studied in more detail. Then, the various functionalities and corresponding architectures and sensing and control requirements will be discussed for different Smart Grid concepts. Â© 2011 IEEE.

TI  - The wave and wind power potential in the western Black Sea
AB  - The main target of this work is to evaluate the wave and wind power resources in the western part of the Black Sea, paying special attention to the Romanian nearshore. The time window considered goes thirty years in the past (starting in 2016 and until 1987). The wind fields provided by the US National Centres for Environmental Prediction have been considered to evaluate the wind power potential. Further on, considering these wind fields, simulations with a wave modelling system have been performed in order to obtain the main wave parameters. By analyzing the wind and wave data for the 30-year period considered, the general patterns of the wind and wave energy have been established. Furthermore, some areas near the Romanian and Ukrainian coasts with high wind power potential have been identified. Also, the synergy between the wind and wave power has been evaluated in ten reference points. Thus, it was identified that along the Romanian coast and continuing to the north close to the coastal area of Ukraine (up to Odessa), there are suitable areas for combined wind-wave exploitation. However, no significant trends were found as regards the wind and wave power. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the effects of actuation limitation on the ReaTHM testing setup for a particular platform: numerical simulations are employed to examine the effects of not including some components of the aerodynamic loads (or of inducing error, for example in the direction of the force actuation).

TI  - Geological Heterogeneity of Coastal Unconsolidated Groundwater Systems Worldwide and Its Influence on Offshore Fresh Groundwater Occurrence
AB  - Numerous coastal areas worldwide already experience fresh water shortages due to overexploitation and salt water intrusion. Future climate change and population growth will further intensify this threat in more areas in coming decades. Therefore, it is necessary to explore any potential fresh water source, such as offshore fresh groundwater, that could alleviate this fresh water shortage and provide valuable time for adaptation measures implementation and changes in water management strategies. Recent evidence suggests that a disproportionally large portion of human population living in coastal areas relies on groundwater resources stored in underlying unconsolidated groundwater systems. These systems are often very heterogeneous, combining numerous high permeability aquifers interlaid with low permeability aquitards with varying total thickness. This heterogeneity is a major control on the fresh groundwater volume and groundwater salinity distribution within such systems. Thus, the quantification of geological heterogeneity is often the limiting factor when estimating fresh groundwater volumes, both inland and offshore, along the global coastline. To overcome this obstacle, we combine conceptual geological models with available state-of-the-art global datasets to derive a set of geological heterogeneity parameter distributions quantifying geological heterogeneity of coastal unconsolidated groundwater systems (CUGSs) as formed over last 1 Ma. These are then used in an algorithm designed to build synthetic heterogenic parameterizations of CUGSs along the global coastline. These, in turn, provide key input for modeling variable-density groundwater flow and coupled salt transport to analyze changes in groundwater salinities and offshore fresh groundwater volume (OFGV). Such an analysis is performed over one full glacialâ€“interglacial cycle (the last 0.13 Ma) to account for oscillating sea-level conditions and shifts in coast-line positions and salinity incursions. Our simulation results show a close match between the modeling scenarios and values presented by literature sources demonstrating the potential of the hereby presented methodology to be applied in similar future studies.

TI  - Tidal and Nontidal Marsh Restoration: A Trade-Off Between Carbon Sequestration, Methane Emissions, and Soil Accretion
AB  - Support for coastal wetland restoration projects that consider carbon (C) storage as a climate mitigation benefit is growing as coastal wetlands are sites of substantial C sequestration. However, the climate footprint of wetland restoration remains controversial as wetlands can also be large sources of methane (CH4). We quantify the vertical fluxes of C in restored fresh and oligohaline nontidal wetlands with managed hydrology and a tidal euhaline marsh in California's San Francisco Bay-Delta. We combine the use of eddy covariance atmospheric flux measurements with Pb-210-derived soil C accumulation rates to quantify the C sequestration efficiency of restored wetlands and their associated climate mitigation service. Nontidal managed wetlands were the most efficient in burying C on-site, with soil C accumulation rates as high as their net atmospheric C uptake (-280 +/- 90 and -350 +/- 150 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). In contrast, the restored tidal wetland exhibited lower C burial rates over decadal timescales (70 +/- 19 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) that accounted for similar to 13\%-23\% of its annual C uptake, suggesting that the remaining fraction is exported via lateral hydrologic flux. From an ecosystem radiative balance perspective, the restored tidal wetland showed a > 10 times higher CO2-sequestration to CH4-emission ratio than the nontidal managed wetlands. Thus overall, tidal wetland restoration resulted in a negative radiative forcing (cooling) through increased soil C accumulation, while nontidal wetland restoration led to an early positive forcing (warming) through increased CH4 emissions potentially lasting between 2.1 +/- 2.0 to 8 +/- 4 decades.

TI  - Modelling and simulation of waste heat recovery systems for marine applications
AB  - Waste heat recovery systems have assumed an important role in the last decade as an effective way to improve fuel utilization in thermal engines, since they provide an opportunity to produce eco-friendly electrical power from an otherwise wasted energy source, leading to a reduction of the pollution and an increase of the overall system efficiency. In this scenario, Rankine cycle technology, based on simple Rankine cycle or Organic Rankine cycle (ORC), earned a good market position, thanks to its ability of producing additional electric power from relatively low- Temperature heat sources (80 to 350Â°C); this feature makes these cycles a very suitable solution as bottomers to Internal Combustion Engines (ICE), geothermal sources, solar thermal modules and micro-gas turbines. This paper presents a waste heat recovery system specifically designed as a bottomer to ICE of different power range for marine applications, using a simple Rankine cycle or a Rankine cycle with ORC further bottoming. The particular application considered shows several advantages for the installation of a waste heat recovery system; in particular, the basically infinite availability of the cooling medium represented by the water sea, avoids any issues in the condenser design. A steady state model of the system is developed via the process simulator CAMEL-Proâ„¢, in order to identify the most convenient configuration, from a thermodynamic point of view. A most interesting feature of this study with respect to previous works, is the comparison of the organic fluids R245fa and R600, widely recognized as two of the best candidate ORC fluids, within a configuration analysis that critically and analytically compares the improvements regeneration can possibly bring in the low grade regime. To this scope, different cycle configurations have been modeled, simulated and comparatively assessed, in order to figure out whether the more expensive Rankine bottoming ORC brings substantial improvements over the simpler Rankine cycle configuration and to investigate system behaviors in bottoming applications to atmospheric intake or turbo-charged marine Diesel engines. The paper shows how adding a bottoming ORC to the Rankine cycle improves the WHR system performance both in terms of recovered electric power (up to 8.11% and 2.67% respectively in small and large application size) and heat source utilization rate, since the heat source temperature could reach values as low as 70 Â°C when considering a Sulphur free fuel. In addition, R 245fa is to be preferred over the R 600 since it allows for the production of the same power considering lower values for the ORC top pressures.
