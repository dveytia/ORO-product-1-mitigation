TI  - Trends of digital and intelligent technology development in the shipping industry
AB  - Present day ships incorporate different degrees of automated systems and the tendency is to increase the degree of â€œintelligenceâ€, eventually leading to autonomous ships at least for some specific operations. This presentation discusses the important aspects of energy transition, of automation and of digitalization that the maritime transportation sector is facing. The pressures of transition to carbon free environment leads to pressures for improving the energy efficiency of ship operation and to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions. This will be achieved by improved technologies and alternative forms as will be presented. The evolution of automation is also discussed as well as the impacts and the problems related with the digitalization in the shipping industry. Â© 2023 the Author(s).

TI  - The costs and benefits of sulphur reduction measures: Sulphur scrubbers versus marine gas oil
AB  - This paper examines the costs and benefits of reduction measures for the shipping industry to comply with the forthcoming sulphur emission regulations. Sulphur scrubbers and marine gas oil are two promising alternatives for ship owners. However, their economic comparisons are primarily based on a private perspective. This paper provides a wider viewpoint by integrating the private abatement costs of ship owners and the social environmental benefits from emission reduction. The results showed that the price spread between marine gas oil and heavy fuel oil is a determining factor in making this choice. Marine gas oil tends to have higher net present values than scrubbers when the price spread of fuel is less than 231. Euros per tonne. Furthermore, it is more beneficial to install a scrubber on new ships than retrofits. An old ship is not suitable for a scrubber installation when its remaining lifespan is less than 4. years.

TI  - Alternative fuels versus traditional fuels in shipping - SOME 2018
AB  - The main source of emissions from sea-going vessels is the exhaust gas from burning fuel in the ship's combustion engines. The first regulation of exhaust gas emissions from ships, which came into effect twenty years ago, was not strict. However, the global 2020 cap on maximum 0.5 % sulphur in the exhaust gas from the ships combustion engines, in combination with the required reduction of nitrogen and carbon emissions for new-built vessels, is an economical and technical challenge for the shipping industry. Alternative fuels such as LNG, LPG, Methanol or Hydrogen is one tempting option for meeting these new requirements. Alternatively, traditional fuels can be used in combination with measures such as exhaust gas cleaning, engine and combustion process modifications. The data and literature of the options and their pros and cons tends to be fragmented and not easily available for shipping- lines, designers and builders. For these reasons, the motivation for this study has been to give an overview of options and compare based upon key performance indicators. The comparison includes; Emissions from Combustion; Well to wake emissions; Space and weight requirements; and Cost. Â© SNAME, SOME 2018.All rights reserved.

TI  - Replacement of a diesel generator with a containerised battery system on-board a containership
AB  - The outcomes from the two IMO Greenhouse Gas Studies (2009 & 2014) (IMO, 2008), (IMO, 2016), highlighted the magnitude of shipping's impact on climate change. This, in combination with the rather stringent regulations, which are continuously being adopted, have resulted in the development of innovative and energy efficient technologies aiming at mitigating shipping's impact on the environment. This design project proposes an energy efficient solution aiming at the reduction of air emissions generated by the fleet of one of the largest sections of international shipping, containerships. By designing a containerised battery system capable of providing 10.3MWh of useful energy, the ultimate aim is to replace an existing diesel generator and to operate the battery system on manoeuvring. With the aid of a load planner software it was ensured that such a system can be loaded on-board a specific containership, without a negative impact on the stability and the structural integrity of the employed vessel. The battery system can be charged both by a shore supply (cold ironing) as well as during the seagoing part of the voyage. The energy feasibility of such a system and the emissions reduction were verified by developing several software models, which allowed various case study trips to be investigated. Results from the case studies suggested that with such a system on-board, emissions can be reduced by 19% when the ship carries only normal containers and by 4 % when the ship carries normal and refrigerated containers. However, the performed financial analysis indicated that such an investment would result to a loss, primarily due to the current price of battery systems.

TI  - The REShiP Project: Renewable Energy for Ship Propulsion
AB  - In recent years the acknowledgement of the relations between the emissions of exhaust gas, in particular CO2, and their effects on climate and environment has grown to a wide level. Many countries and international organizations have begun to work to mitigate the problem and drive the society towards more sustainable sources of energy. Shipping is no exception and in 2018 the IMO-International Maritime Organization set the ambitious goal of reducing the CO2 emissions of the shipping industries of at least 50% within 2050, compared to the levels of 2008. This has introduced the need to research and develop new, sustainable energy sources and power systems for ships. The REShiP projects is aimed to identify a type of ship which would be suitable for an early adoption of a carbon free or carbon neutral fuel and a matching power generation system, tailored on specific routes. A small ferry powered by a hybrid combination of liquid hydrogen-fuelled fuel cells and Lithium-ion batteries has thus been identified. A mathematical model was developed to optimize the usage of fuel cell and batteries based on the ship operative profile. A multi objective optimization was implemented to minimize system performance degradation. To support the mathematical model a 7 kW PEMFC power generating unit was assembled and relevant data have been analysed. Following a regulatory framework research and in lack of comprehensive prescriptive rules, the design of the ferry and the prototype was done in accordance with the alternative design approach based on the risk assessment methodology, reaching a level of confidence appropriate to award an approval in principle.

TI  - Performance In-Live of Marine Engines: A Tool for Its Evaluation
AB  - Currently, most ships use internal combustion engines (ICEs) either as propulsion engines or generator sets. The growing concern in environmental protection along with the consequent international rule framework motivated shipowners and designers to replace conventional power systems in order to mitigate pollutant emissions. Therefore, manufacturers have made available on the market many technological solutions to use alternative fuels (Liquefied Natural Gas or LNG, methanol, etc.). However, the main energy source is still fossil fuel, so almost all the ICEs are made up of turbocharged diesel engines (TDEs). TDEs have still the potential to improve their efficiency and reduce fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. In particular, the interpretation of Industry 4.0 given by manufacturers enabled the installation of a robust network of sensors on TDEs, which is able to allow reliable power management systems and make ships much more efficient regarding operating costs (fuel consumption and maintenance) and environmental footprint. In this paper, a software tool that is capable of processing the in-live performance of TDEs is described. The great novelty consists in the ability to process all the information detected by the sensor network in-live and dynamically optimize TDEs' operation, whereas the common practice involves the collection of performance data and their off-line processing.

TI  - Shore power vs low sulfur fuel oil: pricing strategies of carriers and port in a transport chain
AB  - With the increasingly serious pollution from the ships berthing at port and the emergence of low-carbon policies, shore power (SP) and low sulfur fuel oil (LSFO) have become effective means to reduce the emissions from ships berthing in the ports. In order to analyse two emission mitigation strategies, we establish a noncooperative game model in a transport chain consisting of a terminal and two carriers who adopt SP or LSFO strategy and obtain the equilibrium results and pricing strategies under different conditions. We observe that, when the carbon price is lower than a threshold, both carriers will choose LSFO; otherwise, both carriers will adopt SP. However, if the two carriers cooperate to maximize their total profits, they will simultaneously choose LSFO when the carbon price is lower than another threshold or choose SP when the carbon price is higher than the threshold, which will maximize the total profits of the transport chain. If the carbon price is less than the threshold, the consumer surplus will be maximized when two carriers adopt LSFO, otherwise the consumer surplus will be maximized when two carriers use SP. If two carriers cooperate to maximize their total profits, this will maximize the entire transport chain's profits and the consumer surplus. Finally, the validity of model is verified by taking Shenzhen Port as an example.

TI  - Analysis of the economy of fuel cells used in merchant ships
AB  - A shift towards more environmentally sustainable shipping is likely to open up for new technology in the maritime sector that is economically competitive to the current incumbent technology represented by diesel engines/generator sets. Marine fuel cell concepts are a promising new technology, which can offer several technical and operational advantages. This study assesses the competitiveness of marine fuel cell applications operated on Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) relative to diesel generator sets, with focus on economic and environmental performance. With regard to the latter, with a carbon containing fuel such as LNG, fuel cells reduce CO2 emissions by about 30% at maximum continuous rating and even more at partial load levels. NOx and SOx emissions are reduced up to 100%. As to the economics, the current higher investment costs of fuel cells are compensated by lower fuel costs (LNG). The modelled results show that with today's high fuel oil price (2008), an energy efficient technology such as fuel cells, will be economically competitive even with capital expenditures double that of the incumbent technology. CO2 taxation is expected to have less influence on the profitability.

TI  - Improving sustainability of maritime transport through utilization of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) for propulsion
AB  - Today, most of the merchant vessels use Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) for propulsion. These heavy oils are cost effective but they produce significant amounts of noxious emissions. In order to respect International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) as fuel for ships becomes an interesting solution as it allows to reduce nitrogen and sulfur oxides emissions. The study of the potentiality of LNG as fuel for ship propulsion is the aim of NGShiP, a research project carried out in Friuli Venezia Giulia - Italy, where the University of Trieste is a partner involved in the development of statistical model for maritime traffic data and process simulation models. In this paper the results of the maritime traffic statistical analysis are presented. In the analysis, the world ships traffic data for the month of May of three different years (2008, 2009, 2010) have been taken into account. The study allows to identify the vessel segments and routes that can benefit most from LNG installation. Results show that RoRo and tankers ships spend most of their sailing time in Emission Control Areas (ECA) and therefore they appear to be the best candidate for LNG installation. On this basis it has been decided to carry out an energy analysis of a tanker ship. Different energy recovery technologies have been considered and analyzed with the aim to improve ship efficiency and reduce environmental impact. Energy analysis results show that the use of LNG as fuel is interesting but important results can be obtained only if a mixture of energy saving/recovering technologies is considered. The analysis shows that an efficiency improvement as high as 15% can be achieved.

TI  - Experimental investigations of hydrogen-natural gas engines for maritime applications
AB  - A novel ship propulsion concept employs natural gas to reduce ship emissions and improve overall ship propulsion efficiency. This concept proposes a serial integration of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and a natural gas engine, while anode-off gas (gas at the fuel cell exhaust) is used in the natural gas engine. This study focusses on SOFC-gas engine integration by experimentally analyzing the effects of adding hydrogen, which is the main combustible component of the fuel cell anode-off gas, in marine natural gas engines. The overall challenge is to employ the anode-off gas to improve the performance of marine natural gas engines. To study the effects of anode-off gas combustion in natural gas engines, experiments with hydrogen addition in a marine natural gas engine of 500 kW rated power were performed. Natural gas was replaced with 10 % and 20 % of hydrogen, by volume, without any penalties in terms of output power. We found that the high combustion rate of hydrogen improved combustion stability, which allowed for better air-excess ratio control. Thus allowing leaning to higher air-excess ratios and extending the, otherwise, limited operating window. Hydrogen addition also improved brake thermal efficiency by 1.2 %, while keeping NOx emissions below the maritime emission regulations. The improvement in engine efficiency with a larger operating window may help improve the load-taking capabilities of marine natural gas engines. Copyright Â© 2018 ASME.

TI  - Cost competitiveness of alternative maritime fuels in the new regulatory framework
AB  - Shipping emissions are expected to grow together with world trade. For this reason, the European Union is targeting shipping emissions both by penalizing the use of fossil fuels and by creating incentives for the shipping sector to increase the role of alternative fuels. This research presents an estimate of when and with what assumptions low-carbon and carbonâ€“neutral maritime fuels will be competitive against fossil fuels, while also examining what will be the cost impact on an individual vessel. The results show that the prices of low-carbon and carbonâ€“neutral fuels are likely to remain high compared with fossil fuels, here assuming the currently planned regulation. The planned regulation, together with the estimated fuel price developments, will significantly increase fuel costs. The cost-optimal fuel path complying with the planned regulation is from fossil fuels via biofuels to electrofuels. Â© 2022 The Authors

TI  - Hybrid-electric propulsion for the retrofit of a slow-tourism passenger ship
AB  - The increasing interest in air pollutant emissions reduction also influences the shipbuilding industry. In this sense, hybrid-electric propulsion is a promising solution for green navigation, ensuring a Zero Emission Mode navigation close to coastal areas and harbors. Hybrid-electric propulsion is a convenient choice not only for new units but also for the retrofitting of outdated ones. This paper deals with an example concerning the retrofitting of a small passenger vessel, where the study of the application of hybrid-electric systems was possible only thanks to reverse engineering techniques for the identification of the internal spaces. The final hybrid configuration refers to a slow-tourism operative profile in the North Adriatic area. Â© 2020 IEEE.

TI  - Application of Alternative Maritime Power (AMP) Supply to Cruise Port
AB  - The International Maritime Organization, the European Union Council and the US government force ship owners to take necessary measures through international conventions and national legislation to minimize ship-based emissions which damage to the environment and has reached a serious level. Thus, ship operators began to turn towards alternative technologies and fuels that reduce emissions to ensure the maritime trade smoothly. On the other hand, some port operators has started to supply alternative maritime power (AMP) which is electricity from city grid line to the ships at the berth. It is a fact that AMP is one of the best emission reduction alternative technologies for ships during berthing period. This kind of ports providing AMP will be compulsory choice for many ship operators who still use fossil fuel-powered engines in their ships and cannot meet the emission limit requirements at ports, also these ports will contribute to the environmental protection. In this study, AMP application will be examined for the Ege Ports in Kusadast. Purpose of the study is to calculate the amount of emissions and external costs and to compare with marine gas oil (MGO) when the AMP system is applied to a port. According to comparison of AMP technology with MGO (0.1\%S); total air pollutant is reduced by 94\% via decreasing SO2 23\%, NOx 97\%, PM 88\%, CO 99\%, VOC 64\%. On the other hand, it is estimated that total released greenhouse gases are minimized by 41\% via decreasing CO2 41\%, N2O 85\% and CH4 81\%. Finally, total emission reduction was about 43\%. The economic and environmental benefits to the port hinterland and its country has been estimated by finding external cost. Total externality cost of MGO for human health, ecosystem quality and climate change was found as about Euro 3 million while Euro 0,4 million occured from AMP.

TI  - Using a Ship's Propeller for Hull Condition Monitoring
AB  - As a ship's hull condition degrades due to marine fouling, more power and fuel are needed to maintain service speeds. One by-product of this increased fuel consumption is increased greenhouse gas emissions. Rising fuel costs, hull maintenance expenses, and mounting environmental regulations make hull condition monitoring a crucial tool for prudent ship operators, to eliminate energy waste due to hull fouling, to reduce carbon emissions, and to eliminate the carriage of invasive species between ports. Methods for using a ship's propeller as a power absorption dynamometer employ the propeller as a measuring instrument to estimate either speed or power. The calibration is typically performed for clean hull conditions, allowing the resulting propeller model to be used to track ship performance degradation due to hull fouling against a standard ``clean-hull{''} baseline. The propeller power absorption technique is presented, along with the salient results of using it to monitor two U.S. Navy sister ships over a one-year long time period. This information may be useful for U.S. Navy decision makers who are responsible for hull/propeller maintenance and hull paint selection

TI  - Chhalenges & opportunities: What eedi and seemp mean for the reduction of GHG emissions from ships
AB  - IMO has developed the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP), which enables the ship operator to plan for and choose from a large number of reduction measures. The SEEMP seeks to improve a ship's energy efficiency through four steps, planning, implementation, monitoring and self evaluation and improvement. These play a critical role in the continuous cycle of improving ship energy management. Also incorporated is the guidance on best practices for fuel efficient operations, optimized ship handling, optimum ballast, optimum propeller, etc. At the time of adopting the new regulations, the MEPC (Marine Environment Protection Committee) approved a work plan that includes the further development of the EEDI framework to cover the ship types and sizes excluded from the current energy efficiency design index (EEDI) requirements. It also includes the finalization of the guidelines for the application of the EEDI, SEEMP, and EEOI.

TI  - Monitoring systems: A strategic tool to enhance ship energy efficiency
AB  - Public opinion shares a deep concern on the environmental impact of pollutants emitted by transport vectors in the air. Even if ships contribute to only 3.5% of the total CO2 emissions, all the marine stack-holders shall join in the objective of further reducing the emission levels from ships in the next few years. IMO is enforcing this objective via the introduction of new regulations on the energy efficiency of new-buildings and existing ships. The amendments to MARPOL Annex VI Regulations, add a new chapter 4 to Annex VI on Regulations on energy efficiency for ships to make mandatory the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) for all ships. Other amendments to Annex VI add new definitions and the requirements for survey and certification, including the format for the International Energy Efficiency Certificate. The regulations apply to all ships of 400 gross tonnages and above and are expected to enter into force on 1 January 2013. On the other hand there is in this case a virtuous relationship between environmental care and economic convenience, especially as far as operational energy saving measures are concerned, as with the increasing costs of fuel every operational action which may increase the energy efficiency of the ship without any expensive re-fitting is expected to reduce the operational costs. It is recognized that monitoring of performance is the pivot around which the SEEMP is cycling as it provides a concrete basis upon which to set-up the planning and evaluate the results thus leading to the requirement for further improvement. Continuous on-line monitoring and immediate availability of all relevant data to the ship stack-holders is also the cornerstone of any progress towards increased ship autonomy. The ship Automation System is the natural candidate to act as the primary collector of all the data relevant to energy efficiency and as the manager of all the processes / plants which may affect the energy efficiency of the ship.

TI  - A novel method for joint optimization of the sailing route and speed considering multiple environmental factors for more energy efficient shipping
AB  - Energy saving and emission reduction have attracted a great deal of attention in the maritime industry. The optimization of a ship's energy efficiency can reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions effectively. However, most of the available studies only focus on either the sailing speed or route optimization, and the interaction between speed and route under the influence of multiple environmental factors was not accounted properly. In this paper, a novel joint optimization method of the sailing route and speed, which considers the interaction between route and speed as well as multiple environmental factors, is proposed to fully exploit the energy efficiency's potential. Moreover, a joint optimization model of the sailing route and speed, which is based on an energy consumption model that considers multiple environmental factors, is established. Next, a solution algorithm for the joint optimization model is investigated in order to achieve joint decision-making with regard to the sailing route and speed. Finally, a case study is conducted that demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can achieve the optimal sailing route and speed under complex environmental conditions, as well as a reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of about 4\%.

TI  - Green technology for eco-friendly and sustainable shipping using adjustable speed drive
AB  - The revised MARPOL Convention addresses emissions from ships under Annex VI, chapter 4, entered into force since 1st January 2013. It set mandatory measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from international shipping, with the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) made mandatory for new ships, and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) made a requirement for all ships. The major consumption of energy and burning of fuel onboard is generally required for Ballast water management, Sea water cooling, Cargo operation and Propulsion. Energy efficiency plays the most important role in reduction of energy consumption, fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, accounting for up to 53% of total CO2 emission reductions onboard ship. In pumping applications onboard vessels for sea water cooling systems, the use of proposed Variable Frequency Drives (VFD) control can cut the energy consumption by as much as 60%. Here we have developed a model of adjustable speed drives for controlling high power centrifugal pumps onboard ship for energy conservation and eco-friendly sailing. The results of simulation shows that the proposed method of flow control using VFD not only saves energy but also reduces burning of fuel and also results in a reduction of greenhouse gas emission. Therefore by the use of proposed Green, Smart and Intelligent technology, we can save significant energy and reduce emission of GHG, so as to meet stringent norms as per MARPOL ANNEX-VI, Chapter-4.

TI  - Introducing a ship electric power quality monitoring system for green shipping
AB  - This paper presents a methodology for installing an electric power quality monitoring system onboard a ship in order to manage and optimize the power consumption of electric loads which are considered critical for the overall ship efficiency. The aftermath is a system comprises measuring devices for recording both voltage and current. The loggers are interconnected via a local intranet-preferably WiFi - to a computer located in the control room of the ship. This methodology was developed within the framework of a research project and the system was implemented onboard actual oil tanker. Specifically, this monitoring system comprises three devices, for three different motors, measuring both input voltage and current. The motors starting operation and equipment were changed. Thus, voltage and current measurements took place before and after the retrofitting so the corresponding energy consumption and power quality were compared. Â© 2014 IEEE.

TI  - Environmental impact assessment of hydrogen-based auxiliary power system onboard
AB  - The maritime transportation sector globally depends on fossil resources while this option is both diminishing and causing serious environmental and air pollution issues. Recently, hydrogen energy becomes one of the key alternatives addressing these concerns under the increasing press effect of the international community. The use of hydrogen as an energy source in ships is provided by fuel cell technologies. Although there are many types of fuel cells, Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) is the most widely used fuel cell type in the maritime industry. The most important handicap for the use of hydrogen in ships seems to be the production and storage of it. For this reason, fuel cell technology and hydrogen production and storage systems must be developed in order to use hydrogen as the main propulsion system in long-distance transportation in the maritime sector. In this study, Reference Energy System (RES) is established for a chemical tanker ship to determine the current energy flow from various resources to demands. Then the appropriate parameters are assigned and this framework is specified by the respective data. Following this phase; the current situation has been developed as the base scenario and analyzed by using the Low Emission Analysis Programme (LEAP) energy modeling platform. Additionally, two alternative scenarios including the hydrogen-based have been applied against the base scenario to compare the environmental results in the 2017â€“2050 time period. When the results are evaluated, it is predicted that although it is not sufficient for IMO and EMSA targets, implementation of hydrogen contributes to the carbon emission reduction positively and it will be more beneficial to apply to the main drive system with the technological developments to be made in the near future.

TI  - Estimating fuel consumption in maritime transport
AB  - Growth in technology has accelerated in the last few decades, and therefore demand for energy has dramatically increased. This has also brought about a major problem called global warming. The scarcity of resources, indeed, have been compelling us to sustain energy with the adoption of cleaner energy practices and alternative ways that can help us reduce energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. With the pressure due to increasing global environmental consciousness, the international shipping industry has thus been exposed to some challenges and energy-related problems it needs to wisely deal with. To reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gases, ship owners and operators need to find an efficient fuel economy with the control and alteration of some related factors. In this study, several determinants of fuel consumption in maritime transport were considered and alternative models were built employing the Response Surface Methodology using data obtained from the noon reports of a bulk carrier. Since the model building process is relatively tedious in the Response Surface Methodology, a guideline was also provided. The results indicate that as their speed increases up to a certain point, ships consume less fuel; however, after such a threshold, fuel consumption begins to increase. In addition, even though its main effect was found insignificant, revolution per minute's interaction with other inputs was found to affect the output. Thus, adopting the Response Surface Methodology, which allows for quadratic terms and higher order interactions, is critical to build a predictive model that performs well so that ship operators and shipping companies can make economic and environment-friendly decisions better. This study serves the literature by estimating the fuel consumptions of cargo ships using statistical models so that carbon dioxide emissions from fuel consumption can be estimated. Even though specific types of fuel and ships were considered, the approach adopted here can be extended and applied to other cases as long as there is accurate data. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Decarbonizing Maritime Transport: The Importance of Engine Technology and Regulations for LNG to Serve as a Transition Fuel
AB  - Current Greenhous gas emissions (GHG) from maritime transport represent around 3\% of global anthropogenic GHG emissions and will have to be cut in half by 2050 to meet Paris agreement goals. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is by many seen as a potential transition fuel for decarbonizing shipping. Its favorable hydrogen to carbon ratio compared to diesel (marine gas oil, MGO) or bunker fuel (heavy fuel oil, HFO) translates directly into lower carbon emissions per kilowatt produced. However, these gains may be nullified once one includes the higher Well-to-tank emissions (WTT) of the LNG supply chain and the vessel's un-combusted methane slip (CH4) from its combustion engine. Previous studies have tended to focus either on greenhouse gas emissions from LNG in a Well-to-wake (WTW) perspective, or on alternative engine technologies and their impact on the vessel's Tank-to-wake emissions (TTW). This study investigates under what conditions LNG can serve as a transition fuel in the decarbonization of maritime transport, while ensuring the lowest possible additional global warming impact. Transition refers to the process of moving away from fossil fuels towards new and low carbon fuels and engine technologies. Our results show: First, the importance of applying appropriate engine technologies to maximize GHG reductions; Second, that applying best engine technologies is not economically profitable; Third, how regulations could be amended to reward best engine technologies. Importantly, while the GHG reduction of LNG even with best engine technology (dual fuel diesel engine) are limited, ships with these engines can with economically modest modification switch to ammonia produced with renewable energy when it becomes available in sufficient amounts.

TI  - Applying an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm to ship energy saving
AB  - Due to the increasingly competitive maritime market and stringent regulatory requirements, the optimization of ship energy efficiency is attracting more and more attention. The energy efficiency of ship navigation is affected by many factors such as ship structure, crew operation and navigation environment. In this paper, the proposed improved second-order oscillating PSO algorithm is used to study the ship energy efficiency from the viewpoint of route optimization by considering the sea conditions and constraints. Firstly, a nonlinear optimization model for ship FOC (fuel oil consumption) considering the time-varying sea state is established. On this basis, the energy efficiency and economic benefits are analyzed in terms of multiple indicators e.g., FOC and CO2 emissions per unit distance and per unit mass of freight. Finally, the energy saving potential of the method is demonstrated with an example of an oil tanker. The results show that both FOC and emissions are reduced after optimization, and energy efficiency and economy are improved by 1.17% and 2.55%, respectively. This indicated that the considerable effect of the proposed method applied to ship energy saving optimization. Â© 2022

TI  - Analysis of maritime transport activity factors influencing global warming
AB  - Over the last decades, global environmental degradation and climate changes have led to concerns about the continued use of fossil fuels. Maritime transport is not only an important element of the global energy supply chain but by itself is a global consumer of energy, contributing to climate impact. To reduce the impact of shipping on the global environment, the International Maritime Organization has established new regulations on emissions from ships. A large number of potential solutions are announced and developed as a means to minimize emissions onboard ships, such as LNG, LPG, methanol, hydrogen, ammonia or to use electric batteries, etc. The article encloses the main factors of international maritime transport activity contributing to global warming, offers a look at the fuel usage for shipping as a sequential element of energy chain following his particular life cycle.

TI  - Intertanko's energy efficiency guide for tankers
AB  - INTERTANKO's guide to establishing an energy efficiency management plan aims to help oil and product tanker operators make measurable reductions in air emissions. The Tanker Energy Efficiency Management Plan (TEEMP) has been developed from information gathered from companies representing approximately 700 tankers. It expands on the IMO's generic Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) published in August 2009 and covers the implementation of measures encompassing voyage optimisation, propulsion resistance, machinery optimisation, cargo handling and awareness building. INTERTANKO recommends the use of a VOC management plan that can be automated by suitable valve technology. Monitoring systems should be operated and maintained by shore staff with minimal administrative burdens placed on crews. A clear division between ship and shore responsibilities should be established. Another source of emissions, although not specifically related to energy efficiency, is the control of volatile organic compounds (VOC) released from the cargo.

TI  - Scrubber installation and green fuel for inland river ships with non-identical streamflow
AB  - Recently, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and government sectors have enacted several stringent regulations to curb the emissions of ships. Green fuel and scrubber installation are two prevailing adaptation strategies used by ships to reduce emissions. Green fuel leads to a high shipping cost with the consumption of low-sulphur but highly-priced oil, while scrubber installation is a long-term decision, which incurs a high capital cost from the setting up of desulphurization facilities but ensures ships can continue consuming low-priced oil. This paper makes a theoretical and holistic investigation of the strategy choice of a container ship in an inland river by taking into account the impact of streamflow velocity. For the inland shipping service, the sailing speed of a ship is the sum of its engine speed and streamflow velocity. The engine speed determines the fuel consumption, and the sailing speed determines the round-trip time of a ship. We found that the engine speed of a ship increases with respect to the streamflow velocity under both strategies in the sense of cost minimization. Also, the streamflow velocity increases the incentive of a ship to install a scrubber. Finally, numerical experiments based on the Yangtze River are conducted to demonstrate our proposed models.

TI  - In-depth | China ship news: CCS: Energy saving and emission reduction solutions for green ships
AB  - Since the 11th Five-year Plan period (2006-2010), China Classification Society (CCS) has launched a range of technical documents regarding the design, management, verification, and evaluation of ship energy efficiency and green standards. To promote the development of inland green shipping, CCS has combined its analyses on inland waterway vessels and inland shipping to set up an inland green ship standardization framework, which include one set of rules and three sets of guidelines. CCS has also developed application software for ship energy efficiency management and operational management systems, as well as software for the calculation of ship's energy consumption distribution. The classification society has also started research on high energy efficient technologies, e.g., LNG dual-fuel engines, heat pump technology, solar power technology, and shore power technology. All these initiatives have showed CCS technical capability in green shipbuilding and also helped build momentum for the sustainable development of China's shipping and shipbuilding industries.

TI  - Reducing GHG Emissions at Military Vessels
AB  - The shipping industry is responsible for 3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, emissions mainly resulting from the combustion of fuels in naval energy aggregates. The current requirements for a 50% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050 represent a challenge for maritime transport, as there is no effective solution to reduce this emissions from ships. Thus, the current problem is represented by insufficient methods to reduce COx2 emissions on board ships, in particular for ships which are in service for more than 10 years, which are the most affected by these environmental requirements, since their design did not take into account the reduction of ecological parameters. In this context, even if military vessels are not subject to IMO GHG emission reduction requirements, they must be aligned with global emissions reduction efforts. This article presents actually operational and technological solutions to reduce COx2 emissions that can be deployed on board military vessels, until other technical solutions or power supply solutions for non-polluting renewable energy aggregates are identified.

TI  - Multi-objective optimization of hybrid PEMFC/Li-ion battery propulsion systems for small and medium size ferries
AB  - Hybrid Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells/Lithium-ion battery powertrains are a promising solution for zero-local-emissions marine propulsion. The present study aims to optimize the design and operation of such hybrid powertrain for small-size passenger ferries, taking into account the performance degradation of both fuel cells and batteries. A Mixed-Integer Linear-Programming approach and a hierarchical method are adopted to concurrently minimize the fuel cells degradation, the capital expenditure and the operating expenditure, while constraints are included in the model to limit the battery degradation. The results show that the proposed multi-objective optimization can lead to a reduction of fuel cells degradation by up to 65\% compared to a cost-minimization only. However, this can imply an increase in the battery capacity by up to 136\%. The proposed method has general validity, and it is a useful tool for both preliminary design and choice of the optimal energy management strategy for ships energy systems.

TI  - Alternative fuel for sustainable shipping across the Taiwan Strait
AB  - We conducted a total fuel life-cycle inventory for atmospheric emissions for two ships operating between Mainland China and Taiwan, comparing the difference that may result from operating on heavy fuel oil (HFO) and on liquefied natural gas (LNG) as fuels. In addition, we assess the global warming impact from these two fueling alternatives. We use a commercially available life-cycle assessment (LCA) software to conduct a life-cycle inventory of airborne emissions from the ship fuel use. Our findings indicate possible improvement in total fuel-life-cycle GHG emissions from the use of LNG as alternative fuel to power ships. While total GHG and CO2 emission reduced, however, methane emissions increased significantly when LNG is used as alternative fuel to power both of our case ships. Both ships exhibit great reduction in the emissions of NOx (38â€“39%) and CO (42â€“43%). The reduction is much more remarkable in SO2 (99.8%) and PM10 (97.5%). The weight of emissions from operation stage has become relatively smaller in the whole fuel life-cycle total GHG emissions, when the two ships move to operate on LNG. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Evaluation of ship efficiency indexes
AB  - IMO is introducing two different emission indexes for a vessel: The Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI). The former will be used to assess the design of the vessel, the latter would be used to evaluate the vessel in operation. Both indexes represent the ratio between emissions, in mass of CO2, and the transported cargo quantity per sailed distance. At moment an important debate is focusing on the definition of the 'baseline' values for different ship categories. The collaboration between d'Amico Shipping Company, Registro Italiano Navale and Department of Naval Architecture, Marine Engineering, Electric Engineering of Genoa University provided the framework for a study aimed to evaluate the carbon footprint of the vessels of the D'Amico fleet, the analysis of various aspects of factors effecting the carbon dioxide emissions caused by ships and improvements of fleet energy management techniques. The results of the study can be divided into two main aspects: it is a picture of the actual carbon dioxide emission status of a cargo fleet and it gives the technical instruments and measure tools to start an emission control policy with reference to a ship energy efficiency management plan.

TI  - Safety integrity level (SIL) determination for a maritime fuel cell system as electric propulsion in accordance with IEC 61511
AB  - This study investigates the safety integrity levels for an electric propulsion system based on a molten carbonate fuel cell in a liquefied hydrogen tanker. The electric propulsion system necessitates multiple electronic and electric elements; thus, the functional safety of the system should be considered. Additionally, a maritime fuel cell system is nonconventional propulsion machinery. This system should follow a risk based ship design framework, and IEC 61511 is a suitable standard for evaluating the functional safety of the system. Hazardous operability studies provide basic information for determining the safety integrity. In this work, a safety layer matrix and calibrated risk graph are generated, and a layer of protection analysis is conducted for a molten carbonate fuel cell stack. Eight guidewords are used to describe accidental scenarios and compare the results of the three methods in an unbiased manner. The most severe consequences are fire and explosion caused by overflows or a control failure in the stack, and the safety integrity levels are mutually different.

TI  - A NUMERICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF MARINE HYDROGEN-NATURAL GAS-DIESEL TRI-FUEL ENGINES
AB  - Maritime shipping is a key component of the global economy, representing 80-90\% of international trade. To deal with the energy crisis and marine environmental pollution, hydrogen-natural gas-diesel tri-fuel engines have become an attractive option for use in the maritime industry. In this study, numerical simulations and experimental tests were used to evaluate the effects of different hydrogen ratios on the combustion and emissions from these engines. The results show that, in terms of combustion performance, as the hydrogen proportion increases, the combustion ignition delay time in the cylinder decreases and the laminar flame speed increases. The pressure and temperature in the cylinder increase and the temperature field distribution expands more rapidly with a higher hydrogen ratio. This means that the tri-fuel engine (H-2+CH4+Diesel) has a faster response and better power performance than the dual fuel engine (CH4+Diesel). In terms of emission performance, as the hydrogen proportion increases, the NO emissions increase, and CO and CO2 emissions decrease. If factors such as methane escape into the atmosphere from the engine are considered, the contribution of marine tri-fuel engines to reducing ship exhaust emissions will be even more significant. Therefore, this study shows that marine hydrogen-natural gas-diesel tri-fuel engines have significant application and research prospects.

TI  - Ship Main Engine Waste Heat Recovery for an Efficient Energy Management
AB  - The main engine internal combustion and friction of moving parts generate great amount of heat. This heat should be maintained within maker temperature thresholds. This is ensured by main engine fresh water-cooling system which circulate the fresh water in a closed loop and which is cooled in its turn by the seawater cooling system, using seawater as cooling fluid media. Then the hot seawater is thrown overboard ship. The heat generated by friction of the moving parts is absorbed by the lubricating oil system. This cooling process represent a great heat loss that is originally produced by consumption of fuel oil. This leads to the increase of fuel consumption and production of greenhouse gases. This paper proposes one of the design measures, to recover the waste heat, by using the hot main engine fresh water outlet for the heating of the accommodation sanitary water and quantifies the reduction of the greenhouse gases resulting in, for and efficient energy management and to comply with international maritime organization ship energy efficiency plan requirements.

TI  - Ship Power Plant Decarbonisation Using Hybrid Systems and Ammonia Fuelâ€”A Techno-Economicâ€“Environmental Analysis
AB  - The shipping sector decarbonisation has attracted great attention due to the sector contribution to worldwide carbon emissions. This study aims at investigating the techno-economicâ€“environmental performance of different ship power plants to identify sustainable solutions for a case study cargo ship. Four scenarios, considering conventional and hybrid power plants, the latter with installed batteries, both using marine gas oil and ammonia fuels, are analysed to estimate the pertinent lifetime key performance indicators characterising their economic and environmental performance. Additionally, taxation schemes of varying extent are considered, and a sensitivity analysis is carried out on the most uncertain input parameters, namely, fuel prices and capital cost. This study results demonstrate that the hybrid plant using ammonia exhibits the lowest environmental footprint associated with 66% carbon emission reduction, whilst increasing the lifetime cost by 40%. Taxation schemes close to 340 EUR per CO2 tonne are required to render it economically viable whilst meeting the IMO targets for 2050 on CO2 emissions reduction. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the economic parameters is highly sensitive to fuel price and the capital expenditure. Â© 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Control Strategy for Battery/Flywheel Hybrid Energy Storage in Electric Shipboard Microgrids
AB  - Integrated power system combines electrical power for both ship service and electric propulsion loads by forming a microgrid. In this article, a battery/flywheel hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is studied to mitigate load fluctuations in a shipboard microgrid. This article focuses on how to determine the reference operation state of the flywheel, which depends on both future power load and the power split between the battery and flywheel. Two control strategies are proposedx2014;an optimization-based approach and a lookup-table-based approach. Case studies are performed in different sea conditions, and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control strategies outperform baseline control strategies in terms of power fluctuation mitigation and HESS power-loss reduction. A comparison between the two proposed approaches is performed, where their performances are quantified, the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy are analyzed, and the cases where they are most applicable are highlighted.

TI  - Impact of SOFC Power Generation Plant on Carbon Intensity Index (CII) Calculation for Cruise Ships
AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has recently discussed the introduction of a new design index called the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), which is a measure of the total carbon dioxide emissions divided by the amount of cargo carried and by the distance travelled on a one-year basis. In this study, authors have analysed a cruise ship assuming its size, the electrical and thermal power required, and its operative profile. CII is calculated with reference to a 180,000 GRT cruise ship equipped with different possible power plant configurations. Emissions in these scenarios are abated by employing alternative fuels like Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), a shore connection, or innovative technologies like Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC). The analysis affirms that a cruise ship powered only by MGO from 2024 will not comply with the CII regulation. Results highlight the potential of LNG in reducing carbon dioxide emissions and, for the reference vessel, the use of LNG alone can guarantee a maximum CII rating up to 2026. The benefits of the installation of 10 MW of SOFC are relevant and similar to the one archived with a power plant composed of dual-fuel internal combustion engines and a shore connection.

TI  - Fuel Consumption and Emissions of Ocean-Going Cargo Ship with Hybrid Propulsion and Different Fuels over Voyage
AB  - Hybrid propulsion and using liquefied natural gas (LNG) as the alternative fuel have been applied on automobiles and some small ships, but research investigating the fuel consumption and emissions over the total voyage of ocean-going cargo ships with a hybrid propulsion and different fuels is limited. This paper tries to fill the knowledge gap by investigating the influence of the ship mission profile, propulsion modes and effects of different fuels on the fuel consumption and emissions of the ship over the whole voyage, including transit in open sea and manoeuvring in close-to-port areas. Results show that propulsion control and electric power generation modes have a notable influence on the ship's fuel consumption and emissions during the voyage. During close-to-port manoeuvres, propelling the ship in power-take-in (PTI) mode and generating the electric power by auxiliary engines rather than the main engine will reduce the local NOx and HC (hydrocarbons) emissions significantly. Sailing the ship on LNG will reduce the fuel consumption, CO2 and NOx emissions notably while producing higher HC emissions than traditional fuels. The hybridisation of the ship propulsion and using LNG together with ship voyage optimisation, considering the ship mission, ship operations and sea conditions, will improve the ship's fuel consumption and emissions over the whole voyage significantly.

TI  - Approaches to Economic Energy Management in Diesel-Electric Marine Vessels
AB  - Recently, the efficiency of diesel-electric marine vessels has been subject for discussion with focus on improving fuel efficiency, reducing the environmental footprint from emissions, as well as reducing running hours and maintenance costs. This paper presents an analysis of load profiles extracted from three different vessels during operation: 1) a ferry; 2) a platform supply vessel; and 3) a seismic survey vessel. The analysis of the extracted data shows that the loadings of the diesel engines are typically quite low, and do not fall within the optimal loading range of diesel engines' specific fuel oil consumption curves. Furthermore, three different power plant configurations are proposed and compared, which include fixed-speed (diesel engine generators) and variable-speed gensets and the implementation of an energy storage system. Moreover, energy management system (EMS) algorithms based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) are proposed as a suitable strategy for optimal unit commitment in the power generation. The results yielded from the MILP algorithms are compared with those from the EMS algorithms based on logic such as if/ else statements. The results indicate that optimal EMS algorithms in combination with a revised vessel configuration can increase the operational efficiency, in terms of fuel savings and reduction in genset running hours.

TI  - Understanding and optimizing vessel propulsive power and fuel use using duty cycle analysis computations
AB  - The maritime industry is in a mindset to save fuel and reduce emissions. How one achieves this end, however, can be a matter of some debate. While substantial industry effort is being placed on things that can be optimized, to achieve real benefit and financial return one must first understand the details about how the vessel consumes propulsive energy during its mission. This paper discusses a rational, simple, and effective systems engineering approach to identify power and fuel demands via computational propulsion analysis of the individual operating modes of a vesselâ€™s duty cycle. It explains sensible consumption metrics that can be used to evaluate and compare different physical systems, strategic plans, or helm decisions. A duty cycle operating mode analysis calculation for a tugboat in multi-role service (as a harbor tug and in long haul ocean barge towing) is demonstrated using COTS software, including examples of design-side and shipboard decision options and consequences.

TI  - Research of the Effectiveness of Selected Methods of Reducing Toxic Exhaust Emissions of Marine Diesel Engines
AB  - The article's applications are very important, as it is only a dozen or so years since the current issues of protection of the atmosphere against emissions of toxic compounds from ships. The issue was discussed against the background of binding legal norms, including rules introduced by the IMO (International Maritime Organization) in the context of the MARPOL Convention (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships), Annex VI, with the main goal to significantly strengthen the emission limits in light of technological improvements. Taking these standards into account, effective methods should be implemented to reduce toxic compounds' emissions to the atmosphere, including nitrogen oxides NOx and carbon dioxide CO2. The purpose of the article was, based on the results of our own research, to indicate the impact of the effectiveness of selected methods on reducing the level of nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide emitted by the marine engine. The laboratory tests were carried out with the use of the one-cylinder two stroke, cross head supercharged diesel engine. Methods of reducing their emissions in the study were adopted, including supplying the engine with fuel mixtures of marine diesel oil (MDO) and rapeseed oil ester (RME)-(MDO/RME mixtures) and changing the fuel injection parameters and the advance angles of fuel injection. The supply of the engine during the tests and the mixtures of marine diesel oil (MDO) and rape oil esters (RMEs) caused a clear drop in emissions of nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide, particularly for a higher engine load, as has been shown. The decrease of the injection advance angle unambiguously makes the NOx content in exhaust gas lower.

TI  - Simultaneous and Global Optimizations of LNG Fueled Hybrid Electric Ship for Substantial Fuel Cost, CO2 and Methane Emission Reduction
AB  - Natural gas (NG) is a promising low-carbon fuel to replace diesel for heavy-duty marine propulsion with prominent fuel cost and carbon dioxide equivalent (CDE) emissions reduction potential. However, using NG in compression ignition (CI) engines presents several inherent drawbacks. This research addresses the central issue of an NG-diesel CI engine with increased methane emissions, resulting in minor CDE emission reduction. The hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions are minimized in addition to fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emission reduction as in the current practice. The simultaneous optimizations of powertrain component sizes and the NG-engine hybrid electric propulsion control are introduced to minimize NG fuel consumption and CDE emissions globally. The top-level powertrain component sizing and bottom-level optimal power control and energy management are conducted simultaneously to achieve global optimization with balanced fuel cost and CDE emissions reductions. The new method reduced the fuel cost by about 75 percent and well-to-wake CDE emissions by about 40 percent over the traditional diesel-mechanical propulsion for the test ferry running under an actual operation profile. The research opened a new path to the global design and control optimization of the NG-diesel CI engine-powered hybrid electric marine propulsion system. Author

TI  - Analysis of Influencing Factors of Ship Operational Energy Efficiency
AB  - The international shipping industry is facing with increasingly strict emission regulations and depressed market; lowering the cost and increasing the efficiency is becoming a universal practice. For a long time, global community and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) have been closely working together, a list of regulations and solutions are worked out; in the meantime, many energy efficiency improvement methods are proposed. In this study, global efforts in tackling climate change are summarized using a timeline approach, which includes the important outcomes of the United Nations Climate Change Conference and the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting. Then, aiming at the energy efficiency operational indicator proposed by the IMO, the mechanism analysis method is used to summarize the influencing factors of the ship's energy efficiency. Last, these influencing factors are analyzed from different perspectives. This study provides a basis for the requirement analysis of the ship energy efficiency monitoring system and also benefits in working out energy efficiency improvement measures for the operational ships.

TI  - The effects of marine vessel fuel sulfur regulations on ambient PM2.5 at coastal and near coastal monitoring sites in the US
AB  - In August of 2012 the U.S. began implementing fuel sulfur limits on certain large commercial marine vessels within 200 nautical miles (nm) of its coasts as part of a North American Emissions Control Area (NA-ECA). The NA-ECA limited fuel sulfur use in these vessels to below 1\% in 2012 and to below 0.1\% starting in 2015. This work uses ambient PM2.5 monitoring data from the U.S. IMPROVE network and Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) receptor modeling to assess the effectiveness of the NA-ECA at reducing ambient PM2.5 from highsulfur residual fuel oil (RFO) use. RFO combustion emissions of PM2.5 are known to have a fairly unique vanadium (V) and nickel (Ni) trace metal signature. To determine if IMPROVE sites were affected by residual fuel oil combustion, V and Ni data from 65 IMPROVE sites in coastal States of the U.S. were analyzed from 2010 to 2011, the two years prior to NA-ECA implementation. 22 of these IMPROVE sites had a V and Ni correlation coefficient (r(2)) greater than 0.65 and were selected for further analysis by PMF. The slopes of the correlations between V and Ni at these 22 sites ranged from 2.2 to 4.1, consistent with reported V:Ni emission ratios from RFO combustion. Each of the 22 IMPROVE sites was modeled independently with PMF, using the available PM2.5 chemical speciation data from 2010 to 2015. PMF model solutions for the 22 sites contained from 5 to 9 factors, depending on the site. At every site a PMF factor was identified that was associated with RFO combustion, however, 9 sites had PMF factors where RFO combustion was mixed with other aerosol sources. For the remaining 13 sites, PM2,5 from RFO combustion was analyzed for three time periods; 2010-2011 representing the time period prior to the NA-ECA implementation (pre-NA-ECA), 2013-2014 representing the time period where fuel sulfur was limited to 1.0\% (NA-ECA 1.0\% S), and 2015 representing the time period where fuel sulfur was limited to 0.1\% (NA-ECA 0.1\% S). All 13 sites indicated statistically significant reductions in the contribution of RFO combustion to PM2.5 between the pre-NA-ECA period and the two periods of fuel sulfur control. The average decrease in annual average PM2.5 from RFO combustion from the pre-NA-ECA to NA-ECA 1\% S period was 50.2\% (range, 29.0\%-65.4\%) and from the pre-NA-ECA to NA-ECA 0.1\% S period was 74.1\% (range, 33.0\%-90.4\%).

TI  - Improving sustainability of maritime transport through utilization of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) for propulsion
AB  - Today, most merchant vessels use Heavy Fuel Oils (HFOs) for ship propulsion. These fuels are cost effective but they produce significant amounts of noxious emissions. In order to comply with International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is becoming an interesting option for merchant ships. The aim of the research presented in this paper is to analyse the economic upturn that can result from the use of LNG as fuel for merchant ships and to assess the effects of its utilization in terms of environmental impact.In the first part of the study, a statistical analysis of maritime traffic is carried out in order to identify which merchant ship types could most benefit from using LNG as fuel for ship propulsion. Traffic data of world ships related to the months of May 2008, 2009 and 2010 are analysed. Roll-on/Roll-off vessels (RoRo) and tanker ships spend most of their sailing time in Emission Control Areas (ECA) consequently appear to be the best candidates for LNG use. In particular, the use of LNG is most profitable for tanker ships in the range of 10,000-60,000DWT (deadweight).In the second part of the study, operational costs and pollutant emission reduction, following LNG implementation, are calculated for a 33,000DWT tanker ship. Results show that LNG leads to a reduction of 35% of operational costs and 25% of CO2 emissions.The possibility of improving energy efficiency on board is analysed considering that combustion gases, produced by LNG, are cleaner, thus simplifying the introduction of exhaust gas heat recovery. Two options are considered: simple heat recovery and heat recovery to drive a turbine (ORC). The results show that it is possible to achieve a reduction in fuel consumption of up to 15%.

TI  - Energy efficiency design index verification through actual power and speed correlation
AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) mandatory requirement for Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) has been in place since 01 January 2015 to address emission and global warming concerns. This regulation must be satisfied by newly-built ships with 400 gross tonnages and above. In addition, the MEPC-approved 2013 guidance, ISO 15016 and ISO 19019 on EEDI serves the purpose for calculation and verification of attained EEDI value. As such, verification should be carriedout through an acceptable method during sea trial and this demands extensive planning during propulsion power system design stage. Power and speed assessment plays the important factor in EEDI verification. The shaft power can be determined by telemeter system using strain gage while the ship speed can be verified and calibrated by differential ground positioning system (DGPS). An actual measurement was carried-out on a newly-built ship during sea trial to assess the correlation between speed and power. In this paper, the Energy-efficiency Design Index or Operational Indicator Monitoring System (EDiMS) software developed by the Dynamics Laboratory-Mokpo National Maritime University (DL-MMU) and Green Marine Equipment RIS Center (GMERC) of Mokpo National Maritime University was utilized. Mainly, EDiMS software employs four channels - engine speed, ship speed, shaft power and fuel consumption - for the verification process. In addition, the software can continuously monitor air pollution and is a suitable tool for inventory and ship energy management plan. Ships greenhouse gas inventory can likewise be obtained from the base of emission result during the engine shop test trial and the actual monitoring of shaft power and ship speed. It is suggested that an integrated equipment and compact software be used in EEDI verification. It is also perceived that analog signals improve the measurement accuracy compared to digital signal. Other results are presented herein. Â© 2016 The Vietnam Maritime University.

TI  - Microscopic approach to evaluate energy consumption and emissions from ships
AB  - Maritime transport plays a central role in the debate about the sustainability of the transport sector. Analyses suggest that air emissions from shipping account for a significant portion of total emissions, affect air quality, and contribute to climate change and human health problems. The existing trend suggests that the situation will worsen. These results, though affected by obvious uncertainties, highlight the urgent need to take action. Harmful environmental impacts are controlled primarily through legislation prohibiting the use of certain substances, setting limits on emissions, and enforcing certain technical standards. However, the basis for designing effective policy instruments to abate air emissions is finding reliable estimates of those emissions. For the shipping sector, a debate continues about the most appropriate way to achieve its air emissions estimate. This paper contributes to this debate by proposing a new methodology that applies some of the available theories from the naval design scientific field to derive a microscopic analytical formulation of the energy produced and consumed by a ship during its trips. The methodology proposed is applied to evaluations of potential savings in energy and emissions by adjusting the speed-acceleration profile of ships in port. Results achieved confirm the power of the methodology and open its application to other case studies. They also highlight an aspect usually neglected in the literature: the impact of ships' activities in port on the environment. The simple exercises performed show clearly the relevance of the issue. They are also able to show that better management of ships' movements in port may produce significant environmental benefits.

TI  - Technologies to improve ship efficiency and reduce harmful emissions
AB  - Marine transportation is considered as an integral part of the global economy as more than 90 per cent of global trade goods are carried through the sea. The shipping industry underwent a tremendous growth during the last century (from 2.6 billion tons annual shipments in 1970 to 9.2 billion tons annual shipments in 2012). The industrial revolution and unrestricted transcontinental trade have catalyzed the global trade volume. Nowadays; merchant ships, approximately 50,000 in number, are sailing across the globe to deliver cargoes of various kinds. On the other hand, the shipping industry is also responsible for a notable amount of total CO2 emissions and several other harmful air pollutants such as Sulfur Oxides, Nitrogen Oxides and Particulate Matter. It may, however, be noted that shipping continues to remain a better environmental option for commercial transportation compared to other available means due to lowest gCO2/ton.km emissions. There is indeed an unrelenting requirement for further improvements in energy efficiency and emissions reduction in the shipping industry as global shipping volume is predicted to continue growing significantly in future. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has been vigorously seeking for new measures for further improvements in energy efficiency and emissions reduction, and swift implementation of these measures to reduce the harmful emissions from international shipping. A major improvement in fuel efficiency and significant reductions in harmful emissions from ships has been achieved over the past decades through improved powering technologies and increasing energy-efficiency of engine and propulsion systems. These technologies can be divided into three major groups, i.e., machinery options, propeller efficiency options and alternate powering options. In this chapter; a comprehensive overview of these green ship technologies is presented which includes basic concepts, principles and potential, related core issues and possible solutions.

TI  - Assessing Energy Saving and Atmospheric Emission Reduction Opportunities in Marine Shipping Sector: an Empirical Result from Container Liners
AB  - For an industry where fuel accounts for at least 30\% of its operating costs, cutting fuel consumption would achieve a major cost reduction. At the same time, this would reduce the marine shipping industry's impact on the environment through reduced emission of SO(x), NO(x), CO(2) and other fuel-related pollutants. Energy conservation and efficiency, or carried even further, utilization of clean renewable energy to replace fossil fuels, is now the most important challenge in the energy application by the industry. Various energy efficiency improvement measures have been suggested by the industry experts, for both new builds and existing vessels. These measures may require significant capital commitment. On the other hand, a well-managed energy system has the potential to save energy requirement of a ship by at least 10\%. It is therefore very important to determine, in light of economic cost and benefits, which one, or which combination, of management and technology alternatives is most promising and shall be applied first. This study is a systematic three-year study-to assess alternatives of reducing fuel consumption onboard merchant ships, with an analysis of the effects of such changes on the ship owner's costs. Starting from current energy practice on board typical merchant ships, the assessment will be carried on to alternative energy technology as well. As the first-stage result, this report documents an investigation of how operating practices affect fuel consumption on board merchant vessels. Actual data obtained from the abstract logs of ten trans-ocean container liners covering three years are used to develop a multivariate model to estimate the elasticity of various factors related to operating practice on the fuel consumption. An assessment is then carried out on possible fuel consumption reduction and cost savings that may result from changes in operating practices. The result confirms, based on actual voyaging data, fuel saving potentials from ship speed reduction and weather routing, two strategies most often suggested by the ship specialists. The study postulates also possible energy efficiency enhancement via shortening planned maintenance intervals of major energy consumers on board, especially of items such as main engine pistons and turbo chargers. However, this preliminary result fails to provide an empirical support to the postulation.

TI  - Data Driven Fleet Monitoring and Circular Economy
AB  - The maritime industry is intensively embracing green thinking. According to the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) strategy, the total annual GHG emissions from international shipping should be reduced by at least 50\% by 2050 compared to 2008. Shipping adopts policies to comply with the set target, including ship redesign, structural retrofit, use of low-carbon material, and the installation of emission abatement technologies. All these approaches pave the way to circularity in the maritime economy, abandoning the linear model in vessel lifetime and adopting lean management, re-manufacturing, and re-usability of the asset. To this end, in the SmartShip project, we give prominence to data-driven ship monitoring by delivering an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) \& Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled holistic cloud-based maritime performance and monitoring system. This system is considering the entire lifecycle of a ship, aiming to optimize energy efficiency, emissions reduction, fuel consumption, while, at the same time, include circular economy concepts in the maritime field. Our approach supports a cost-effective strategy where data analysis drives decisions in ship operation and maintenance.

TI  - Life-cycle cost assessments of different power system configurations to reduce the carbon footprint in the Croatian short-sea shipping sector
AB  - In order to comply with stringent environmental regulations, shipbuilders and ship-owners are seeking cleaner fuels and the integration of renewable energy sources into ship power systems. Such solutions regularly result in additional costs for ship operators, both in the case of retrofitting existing ships or acquiring completely new vessels. This paper deals with the life-cycle cost assessments (LCCAs) of different power system configurations of a ro-ro passenger vessel operating in the Croatian short-sea shipping sector. Electrification of the ship is considered as an option to reduce the carbon footprint (CF) of the vessel and to achieve economic savings during its lifetime. In this sense, the ship operational profile is analysed and its total power needs are determined. The life-cycle assessments of an existing diesel engine-powered solution and two potential battery-powered ship options (with and without photovoltaic cells) are performed by means of GREET 2018 software. Furthermore, these options are compared from an economical viewpoint, where different carbon credit scenarios are investigated. The results show that a diesel engine-powered vessel has the highest carbon footprint, as expected. However, it is also found that a battery-powered vessel (with or without photovoltaic cells) has a minimum environmental footprint and at the same time represents economically the most favourable solution for all possible carbon allowance scenarios. This indicates that all-electric ships seem to be a promising option for the future development of the Croatian short-sea shipping sector.

TI  - Feasibility and commercial considerations of LNG-fueled ships
AB  - Regulatory initiatives obligate maritime operators to reduce emission via retrofitting propulsion and exhaust treatment systems or by using alternative fuels. Although these initiatives facilitate the emergence of LNG as a marine fuel, the proliferation of LNG technology is dependent on the relationship that defines the competitiveness of conventionally fueled and LNG-fueled ships. This article proposes a methodology to evaluate the commercial incentives that are required to promote LNG as a marine fuel, which can be used to assess policy initiatives that encourage the use of alternative technologies and estimate their market impact. To develop the context and support this methodology, the following areas are discussed: (1) international regulatory frameworks and regional initiatives supporting the use of LNG as a marine fuel; (2) commercial and operational attributes that determine the competitiveness of LNG-fueled ships; and (3) challenges preventing the adoption of LNG as a marine fuel, including the uncertainties and less-quantifiable concerns expressed by the maritime operators.

TI  - Decarbonization of maritime transport: to be or not to be?
AB  - International shipping is at a crossroads as regards decarbonization. The Paris climate change agreement in 2015 (COP21) was hailed by many as a most significant achievement. Others were less enthusiastic, and more recently American President Trump decided to take the U.S. out of the agreement. Four years earlier, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) had adopted the most sweeping piece of regulation pertaining to maritime greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction, in the name of the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI). In addition, one year after COP21, the IMO adopted a mandatory data collection system for fuel consumption of ships and agreed on an initial strategy and roadmap on the reduction of GHG emissions from ships. This paper takes a critical look at the above and other recent developments and focuses on the challenges faced by the industry if a path to significant CO2 reductions is to be successful. Difficulties and opportunities are identified, and the paper conjectures that the main obstacles are neither technical nor economic, but political.

TI  - Diesel engine NOx reduction using charge air water injection
AB  - The Transportation Development Centre of Transport Canada, in collaboration with Environment Canada's Emissions Research and Measurement Division, conducted a series of emissions tests onboard the Oceanex RoRo vessel MV Cabot operating between Montreal, Quebec, and St. John's, Newfoundland. The primary objectives were to verify emissions inventories and demonstrate the feasibility of installing affordable emissions reduction technology on marine vessels as well as compliance with future regulatory emissions limits. The tests also provided an opportunity for Canada to share information on emissions program and technology developments with U.S. regulatory authorities. This may lead to developing joint emissions reduction initiatives for existing marine vessels. This paper describes the field-testing of a water injection system (WIS) to reduce oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions from ocean-going vessels. Tests were conducted on a semi-dedicated basis during voyage and under steady-state conditions. The emissions measurements were taken in accordance with ISO 8178-4-E3 protocol and using both marine diesel oil and intermediate fuel oil, which enabled the evaluation of the impact of different fuel type and quality on emissions. An initial series of tests was carried out on the MV Cabot in March 2004, followed by a second series of tests on the same vessel in March 2005. These tests demonstrated the effectiveness of a low-cost WIS for reducing NOx emissions in marine diesel engines. They also showed that water injection reduces NOx at the expense of an increase in both particulate matter and carbon monoxide when using intermediate fuel oil. NOx reductions varied between 10 and 35 percent, and were most effective at high water injection ratios above 50 percent engine load. The test results showed no negative impact of the WIS on fuel consumption or engine operation and performance. This paper compares the results obtained from the consecutive series of tests in terms of the effectiveness of NOx reduction, and analyses the results in the context of other full-scale test results obtained from emissions control system vendors and engine suppliers. It also investigates the theoretical process and technology of water injection through charge air fumigation, and both direct water and fuel/water emulsion injection. In addition, the effects of water injection on engine emissions, operation and maintenance, and the optimization of water injection from a knowledge-based perspective are discussed. Further testing and development of the WIS are required to realize optimal emissions reduction potential and to determine the impact of water injection on fuel consumption, and engine operational performance as well as the impact of fuel quality on emissions.

TI  - Potential economic and environmental advantages of liquid petroleum gas as a marine fuel through analysis of registered ships in South Korea
AB  - Due to the environmental damage caused by pollutants generated from ships, air pollution regulations are increasingly being strengthened and new technologies are being developed for the use of various eco-friendly fuels. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is an attractive eco-friendly fuel that can bridge the transition to commercialized zero-carbon ships. LPG, as an alternative marine propulsion fuel, has advantageous characteristics and market competitiveness, particularly for fishing vessels as well as small and medium-sized domestic vessels. This study quantitatively analyzed the annual fuel consumption costs and reduction in the air pollutants by using LPG fuel in South Korean registered ships that had a high feasibility for conversion to LPG fuel. For all the ships, the annual fuel consumption was reduced by 7.5â€“10.4% and the fuel cost by 8.8â€“25.9%. Furthermore, compared to conventional fuels, the most harmful pollutants such as SOx, PM10, and PM2.5 could be removed after converting to LPG fuel, and CO2 emissions could be reduced by 10â€“14%. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the use of LPG through government policies and price subsidies, particularly for fishing vessels with a high feasibility for conversion to LPG. These efforts should be based on the effectiveness and competitiveness of LPG, which is widely applicable regardless of ship size and can reduce air pollutants like when using liquefied natural gas fuel.

TI  - Trend analysis of domestic and international regulations for electric propulsion system
AB  - While regulations are being strengthened to prevent air pollution from ships in Korea and other countries, the Korean government has passed the Eco-Friendly Ship Act, which is effective from 1 January 2020. Therefore, for coastal ships constructed in Korea, the emission of air pollutants should be reduced by alternative fuel and improving their propulsion system. Accordingly, the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries in Korea has announced a plan to promote the conversion of all 140 government ships into eco-friendly ships using liquefied natural gas or electric propulsion systems by 2030. To apply these propulsion systems, rules, and regulations of the Korea government must first be reorganized. In this study, the type and development trend of electric propulsion systems are reviewed, and trends in regulations for installing electric propulsion systems on ships in various countries, including the United States and Europe, and institutions, including the IEC, IEEE, and International Maritime Organization, are analyzed. Finally, the standardization of the regulation system is discussed to facilitate the introduction of eco-friendly ships to Korea, and relevant implications will be presented. Â© 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Feature 1: Green ship technology: Triality tanker design interests owner
AB  - The DNV's new Triality tanker design, which incorporates a new hull geometry with existing technology that could reduce CO2 emissions substantially, is presented. The fuel that the new ship should use is LNG. Maersk's manager of the innovations department of Gunnyar Bjornsson, who is a naval architect and master mariner and specializes in the use of LNG as a fuel, was impressed by the hull design and the ballast free elements of the concept vessel. However, although Ms Grimstad Osberg conceded that LNG is not the only answer to the maritime sector's emissions conundrum, the fuel would reduce CO2 by around 34% while particulates and SOx would be reduced by 94%, NOx by 82%, and VOC by 100%. Triality is already fitted with some innovative systems that would improve its energy efficiency, e.g., using the low temperature of the LNG fuel, which is stored under pressure in two 6750 cu m tanks at -163Â°C, to cool the ignition temperature of the main engines, reducing NOx emissions, and improving efficiency.

TI  - The estimation of the pollutant emissions on-board vessels by means of numerical methods
AB  - Protection of the environment, especially within the most recent years, has become a constant problem considered by the states and the governments of the world, which are more and more concerned about the serious problems caused by the continuous deterioration of the environment. The long term effects of pollution on the environment generated by the lack of penalty regulations, have directed the attention of statesmen upon the necessity of the elaboration of normative acts meant to be effective in the continuous fight with it. Maritime transportation generates approximately 4\% of the total of the CO2 emissions produced by human activities. This paper is intended to present two methods of estimation of the gases emissions on-board a vessel, methods that are very useful for the crews which are exploiting them. For the determination and the validation of these methods we are going to use the determinations from the tank ship. This ship has as a main propulsion engine Wartsila DU Sulzer RT Flex 50 - 6 cylinders that develops a maximal power of 9720 kW and has a permanent monitoring system of the pollutant emissions. The methods we develop here are using the values of the polluting elements from the exhaust gases that are determined at the exit of the vessel from the ship yard, in the framework of the acceptance tests. These values have been introduced within the framework of a matrix in the MATHCAD program. This matrix represents the starting point of the two mentioned methods: the analytical method and the graphical method. During the study we are going to evaluate the development and validation of an analytical tool to be used to determine the standard of emissions aimed at thermal machines on ships. One of the main objectives of this article represents an objective assessment of the expediency of using non-fuels for internal combustion engines in vessels.

TI  - Shipping Decarbonization: An Overview of the Different Stern Hydrodynamic Energy Saving Devices
AB  - In recent years, research into ships has focused on reducing emissions, consuming less energy, and being more efficient. As a result, the maritime industry has been continuing in a green and sustainable direction. Improving the fuel efficiency of ships and the decarbonization of shipping are important issues to reduce fuel consumption and emitted Greenhouse Gas (GHG) amounts. Decarbonization in the shipping industry could be achieved through technical and operational strategies such as Energy Saving Devices (ESDs) to reduce the fuel consumption of new and existing ships. According to the makers, ESDs can optimize fuel efficiency by up to 15\%. This paper reviews the current literature on stern hydrodynamic ESDs, which are mainly used on typical merchant vessels, i.e., bulkers, tankers, and carriers. A comprehensive review is carried out analysing the different available solutions for stern hydrodynamic ESDs, the working principles, the methods used for the design, optimization, and evaluation of the performance improvements, and the relevant issues of these specific ESDs.

TI  - Consideration regarding the reduction of pollutions emissions by increasing energy efficiency in ship operations
AB  - The use of experimental investigation techniques in the research of internal combustion engines has contributed substantially to their progress and development over time. The performances obtained in the development of modern engines have been strongly influenced by the emergence and development of the investigation equipment, especially the laser and the modern computing technique. Maritime transport generates about 4% of the total CO2 emissions produced by human activities, which means that its carbon value is almost as large as that of Germany. Emissions from this sector are not yet internationally regulated, but this issue is currently being debated within the IMO and the United Nations Framework Convention on climate change (UNFCCC). Of the strategies to reduce pollutant emissions from ships, identified so far, the technical solutions are the first ones that have been implemented on board. The advantage of using technical solutions onboard ships is the high efficiency of reducing a product or several pollutant products, but the main disadvantage is the high cost of implementing and operating them on board ships.

TI  - Shipping developments and trends: Meeting emission regulations
AB  - According to the IMO, CO2 emissions from shipping will almost triple by 2050. Thus, in July 2011, the IMO made instruments for reducing marine carbon emissions mandatory for all newbuildings and in-service vessels, i.e., the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP). In addition to EEDI and SEEMP, the IMO and regional authorities, e.g., EU, are discussing the introduction of market-based instruments for emissions reduction. These include an emissions trading system, emissions taxation, and greenhouse gas fund coupled with a bunker surcharge.

TI  - Assessment of potentially cutting GHG emissions from shipping in relation to energy consumption trends using Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process
AB  - Maritime shipping is one of the most important activities of the global economy, with outstanding advantages in terms of volume and distance. According to projections by the International Transport Forum, Global demand for marine transportation is expected to grow dramatically over the next three decades. Along with that, maritime activities emit large amounts of greenhouse gases and other harmful emissions, causing negative impacts on the environment. Energy consumption trends (ECT) are formed by the application of potential emission reduction solutions such as technical improvement, use of alternative fuels, efficient and economical use of fuel and optimal vessel operation. However, ECT is, an issue related to various criteria to be assessed. The goal of this study is to make science assessment of ECT which can be developed national ship emission reduction strategy. Availability of energy supply and use, emission reduction potential, economic efficiency were simultaneously considered to evaluating ECT to cut GHG emission from shipping by using Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process combined with opinions of 46 experts. The results show that hydrogen fuel ranks highest in ECT as the future fuel of the maritime industry. The findings of this study are expected as an important platform to develop national ship emission reduction strategy planning. Â© 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Optimal Slow Steaming Speed for Container Ships under the EU Emission Trading System
AB  - Slow steaming is an operational measure in ocean-going vessels sailing at slow speeds. It can help climate mitigation efforts by cutting down marine fuel consumption and consequently reducing CO2 and other Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG). Due to climate change both the European Union (EU) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) are analysing the inclusion of international shipping in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) in the near future or alternatively implementing a carbon tax. The paper proposes a methodology to decide the optimal speed of a vessel taking into account its characteristics and the factors that determine its economic results. The calculated cash flow can be used in valuation models. The methodology is applied for a case study for any container ship in a range from 2000 to 20,000 Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEU) on a leg of a round trip from Shanghai to Rotterdam. We calculate how speed reduction, CO2 emissions and ship owner's earnings per year may vary between a business-as-usual scenario and a scenario in which shipping is included in the ETS. The analysis reveals that the optimal speed varies with the size of the vessel and depends on several variables such as marine fuel prices, cargo freight rates and other voyage costs. Results show that the highest optimal speed is in the range of 5500-13,000 TEUs whether or not the ETS is applied. As the number of TEUs transported in a vessel increases emissions per TEU decrease. In an established freight rate market, the optimal speed fluctuates by 1.8 knots. Finally, the medium- and long-term expectations for slow steaming are analysed based on future market prices.

TI  - Numerical investigation to increase ship efficiency in regular head waves using an alternative engine control strategy
AB  - According to the International Maritime Organization (IMO)â€™s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) strategy whose aim is to reduce the shipping industryâ€™s total carbon emissions by 50% by the year 2050, it is desirable to increase ships energy efficiency to reduce GHG emissions and fuel costs. To do so, a short-term measure is to develop innovative engine control strategies in waves that will reduce shipâ€™s GHG emissions. In this study, a mathematical model is developed to assess two engine control strategies: the standard constant rotational speed mode and an innovative constant fuel rack approach. The coupled model is made of a mean value engine, propeller curves and a ship behavior simulator. Emphasis is placed on the presentation of the engine model and references are given for further details on the ship simulator. After verifying the coupling between the engine model and the ship simulator, the fuel consumption is compared, for the two strategies, at the same average speed and for three head regular waves. This paper presents the basics of a further long time research project and shows that coupling ship simulators with engine simulators leads to promising simulation tools for a shipâ€™s GHG emissions reduction. Results from a first application case show that the constant fuel rack approach reduces fuel consumption (up to 1.6%). Â© IMechE 2022.

TI  - Evaluating the utilisation of clean fuels in maritime applications: A techno-economic supply chain optimization
AB  - Interest in reducing the environmental impact of maritime shipping operations has recently been induced by the International Maritime Organization's latest set of regulations. Consequently, this study involves a macro-level view of the entire supply chain, emphasizing how liquefied natural gas exporters can reduce the environmental impact of shipping activities of energy commodities (LNG, hydrogen, ammonia and their blends) through greater uptake of cleaner fuel alternatives. This study tests the notion that demand for alternative fuels will continue to increase as the transportation sector integrates cleaner fuels to comply with increasing environmental regulations. Using Qatar as a case study, linear programming was used to develop a mathematical model where several scenarios are assessed, and the optimal combination of fuels sold, and bunker fuel consumed is determined. Firstly, by looking for maximum profit given the constraints imposed; secondly, by looking for minimal greenhouse gas emissions under the same constraints; and thirdly, by looking for maximum profit and minimum environmental impact. Results demonstrate that cleaner fuels can reduce emissions of maritime industry. While solving for minimal emissions regardless of profit, outcomes suggest that LNG is the most favourable fuel to sell due to the high demand and high production capacity, whereas NH3 is the most favourable for fuelling ships. This solution yielded a significant reduction of CO2 emissions as opposed to that expected from HFO. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Assessment of a Hydrogen-Fueled Heavy-Duty Yard Truck for Roll-On and Roll-Off Port Operations
AB  - The port-logistic industry has a significant impact on the urban environment nearby ports and on the surrounding coastal areas. This is due to the use of large auxiliary power systems on ships operating during port stays, as well as to the employment of a number of fossil fuel powered road vehicles required for port operations. The environmental impact related to the use of these vehicles is twofold: on one hand, they contribute directly to port emissions by fuel consumption; on the other hand, they require some of the ship auxiliary systems to operate intensively, such as the ventilation system, which must operate to remove the pollutants produced by the vehicle engines inside the ship. The pathway to achieve decarbonization and mitigation of energy use in ports involves therefore the adoption of alternative and cleaner technology solutions for the propulsion systems of such port vehicles. This paper presents the performance analysis of a hydrogen powered cargo-handling vehicle for roll-on and roll-off port operations in a real case scenario. The fuel cell/battery hybrid powertrain of the vehicle has been previously designed by the authors. On the base of real data acquired during an on-field measurement campaign, and by means of a validated numerical model of the vehicle dynamics, different mission profiles are defined, in terms of driving and duty cycles, in order to represent typical port operations. A rule-based energy management strategy is then used to estimate the energy and hydrogen consumptions required by the vehicle and to assess its suitability to accomplish the defined target port operations. Outputs from this study show the potential of the proposed solution to take the place, in a foreseeable future, of conventional Diesel-engine vehicles, today commonly used in port logistics, towards a zero-emission scenario.

TI  - An examination of social factors that impact vessel efficiency
AB  - In this paper, we will investigate social factors that indirectly affect ship energy efficiency, intended or not. These include fleet management, charter party agreements, piracy, regulatory factors such as Emission Control Areas, port congestion and port awareness, economic factors such as cost of fuel and charter rates, and human factors (safety, comfort, attitude, and education). I call them â€œsocial factorsâ€ because they all have the characteristic of being created by our society, rather than being driven by the laws of physics. In comparison, physical factors include such things as hull and propeller design and condition, draft and trim, speed through water, engine state of tune, weather effects such as waves, wind and storms, ocean currents, and fuel quality. While optimizing for physical factors can lead to energy and cost reductions of 5-20%, focusing our attention on social factors can lead to even higher net savings, providing greater return on investment. First, we will review how social factors differ from physical ones. Then we will explore several social factors that affect operating efficiency that are frequently overlooked as having potential for optimization, or at least taken for granted as being unavoidable. Finally, we will examine specific social factors where existing technology, either as is or in modified form, may be applied toward realizing substantial return on investment in terms of operating costs, along with reductions of fuel consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Energy and Emission Quality Ranking of Newly Produced Low-Sulphur Marine Fuels
AB  - The article describes the methodology of engine tests on new types of low-sulphur marine fuels in laboratory conditions in order to conduct a comprehensive assessment of their suitability for powering full-size marine engines. The innovativeness of the proposed solution consists of adapting the laboratory Diesel Engine Test Bed to carry out experimental tests using residual and alternative fuels so that it is possible to imitate the real operating conditions of the ship engine. The main aim of the research program was to assess the energy efficiency of six different low-sulphur marine fuels and their impact on the chemical emissivity of engine exhaust gases and air pollution with toxic and harmful chemical compounds. In order to achieve the research purpose formulated in this way, it was necessary to: (1) equip the constructed laboratory stand with highly specialised measuring equipment and (2) develop a technology for determining diagnostic parameters representing the basis for developing a ranking of the energy and emission quality of the tested marine fuels according to the proposed physical model. The model distinguishes 10 diagnostic parameters that, after normalisation, form two subsets of evaluation parameters - stimulant and destimulant. Determining their values made it possible to estimate a synthetic variable, according to which all the tested fuels were adjusted in the order from the ``best `` to the ``worst ``, in accordance with the adopted qualitative criteria of such an assessment. The results of the laboratory tests show that among the considered fuels, i.e., MDO, MGO, RMD 80/L, RMD 80/S, RME 180, and RMG 380 type, the best solution is to use MDO distillate fuel to power full-size marine engines. However, taking into account its high purchase price, a rational alternative decision is to choose RMG 380 type residual fuel, which ranks second in the ranking of the functional quality of the tested marine fuels.

TI  - The Development of the Ships Shore Power Supply System on the Passenger Port of Riga
AB  - In the world approximately 90\% of freight is provided by maritime transport. Sea vessels provide a relatively large amount of total emissions in the world {[}1]. Nowadays marine pollution, especially air emissions from passenger ships berthing close to the city centers is an important factor making impact to the cities air quality. This problem can be partially solved by the ship's shore power system. This system will also reduce the vessel's fuel consumption, equipment maintenance and crew costs.

TI  - Design for performance: CREATING world's cleanest ship
AB  - Partners from CREATING (Concepts to reduce environmental impact and attain optimal transport performance by inland navigation) project, together with BP, have developed a new vessel, which they claim is virtually emission-free. The Cleanest Ship uses novel technologies for speed control, low sulfur fuel use, SCR, and particulate matter filters. The Victoria, managed by Verenigde Tankrederij, is on long-term charter to BP Marine Lubricants and operates in the Port of Rotterdam and Antwerp areas. The vessel had to undergo various modifications, which are expected to cut down NOx emissions and particulate matter, while SOx emissions will almost be completely eliminated and CO2 emissions are expected to be reduced. Victoria's SOx emissions have been cut by almost 100% by changing the fuel from a fuel oil with 1000 ppm sulfur prior to the project, to using an ultra-low sulfur fuel oil similar to diesel used by trucks with just 10 ppm sulfur.

TI  - A review of waste heat recovery technologies for maritime applications
AB  - A waste heat recovery system produces power by utilizing the heat energy lost to the surroundings from thermal processes, at no additional fuel input. For marine vessels, about 50 percent of the total fuel energy supplied to diesel power-plant aboard is lost to the surroundings. While the total amount of wasted energy is considerable, the quality of this energy is quite low due to its low temperature and has limited potential for power production. Effective waste heat recovery systems use the available low temperature waste heat to produce mechanical/electrical power with high efficiency value. In this study a review of different waste heat recovery systems has been conducted, to lay out the potential recovery efficiencies and suitability for marine applications. This work helps in identifying the most suitable heat recovery technologies for maritime use depending on the properties of shipboard waste heat and achievable recovery efficiencies, whilst discussing the features of each type of system.

TI  - EXPERIMENTAL STUDY ON THE EFFECTS OF ULTRA-LOW SULFUR DIESEL FUEL TO THE EXHAUST EMISSIONS OF A FERRY
AB  - Ship emissions have a significant contribution to the global emissions and have adverse effects to the environment and human health. This study investigates the effects of ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel on the gaseous and PM emissions of a ferry, experimentally. On-board emission measurements were carried out both for the main and auxiliary engines which are four-stroke medium speed diesel engines. The concentrations of NOx, SOx, CO, CO2, O-2, PM and HC were measured for various engine loads. The shaft power measurements were also performed. The weighted emission factors, monthly and annual emissions of the ferry are calculated using the experimental data. The weighted emission factors of NOx, SOx, CO, CO2, HC and PM emissions for the main engine are found to be 11.91 g/kWh, 0.10 g/kWh, 0.67 g/kWh, 611.14 g/kWh, 0.62 g/kWh and 0.079 g/kWh, respectively. For the auxiliary engine, the weighted emission factors of NOx, SOx, CO, CO2 and HC are respectively, 13.01 g/kWh, 0.11 g/kWh, 2.19 g/kWh, 641.69 g/kWh and 1.31 g/kWh. The amount of emissions from the ferry is found to be maximum in the summer season. The results show that the emission factors are the major parameter in the emission inventory studies and should be defined carefully. It is seen that the ship emissions, especially SO2 and PM emissions can be reduced substantially by using the ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel. Therefore, the sustainability of the maritime transport can be improved by utilizing the ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel for the propulsion of ships.

TI  - An innovative study on a hybridized ship powering system with fuel cells using hydrogen and clean fuel blends
AB  - Marine transportation is the main means of transporting massive goods overseas that cannot be transported using rail or aviation. Using fossil fuels has significantly impacted global warming and changed the climate. This paper focuses on the development of a new hybridized powering system that uses environmentally benign hydrogen-based fuels in five different blends. The proposed powering system is uniquely designed and consists of an internal combustion engine (ICE), gas turbine (GT), solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), and thermoelectric generators (TEG). This system is investigated thermodynamically after validating the results with a traditional ICE using marine gas oil (MGO-DMA) fuels. The two traditional ICE engines produce a net power of 21048 kW with a 22.9 % energy efficiency and a 29.0 % exergy efficiency. However, the hybridized GT and ICE system can deliver a maximum power of 27773 kW using a dimethyl-ether and hydrogen fuel blend with a percentage increase of 32 %, while the minimum power is obtained to be 24968 kW (an increase of about 19 %) using methane and hydrogen blend. The addition of SOFC can increase the GT power by double and raise the energy efficiency from 19 % to 32 %. Blending all five fuels, such as hydrogen, methane, dimethyl ether, methanol and ethanol, can drop the specific fuel consumption to 254.5 g/kWh by 21.7 % and raise the total power to 27719.5 by 31.7 %. In addition, the carbon emissions are drastically decreased by about 61 % by utilizing sustainable fuel blends; meanwhile, the overall system performance is increased by more than 35 %.

TI  - Effect of geometry characteristic of oil tankerâ€™s t stiffener profile towards ultimate strength under axial compressive load
AB  - Future LNG field development project in Indonesia will be dominated by local buyer of the country, so that additional LNG tankers are needed for the domestic market in the future. Theoretically Dual Fuel Steam Mechanical (DFSM) or steam propulsion system has a low thermal efficiency, but more reliable than the DFDE propulsion system. On the other hand Dual Fuel Diesel Electric (DFDE) propulsion system has shortcomings in the technology that is the presence of methane slip potential for global warming with a Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 20-25 times greater than CO2 over a period of 100 years or 20 times at intervals of 20 years, thus actually reducing the achievement of the energy efficiency of the propulsion system. In this paper, two LNG ship propulsion system that is DFSM and DFDE which is currently the most widely used by operators in Indonesia were compared technically and economically. Technically, the IMO guidelines on Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and the Energy Efficiency Operational Index (EEOI) were used as a means of comparison, while from the economical side life cycle cost (LCC) CAPEX and OPEX cost-based of the ships were analysed. Based on the technical evaluation using the guidelines EEDI and EEOI of LNG tankers by considering the slip of methane in the DFDE propulsion system, showed that the value of the achievement of EEDI and EEOI the DFSM propulsion system lower (more efficient) than the value of the achievement of the DFDE propulsion system and economics evaluation based on the LNG tankers cost life cycle (LCC) for 20 years by considering the risks of loss and penalty carriage of LNG that may occur due to the failure of the propulsion system and the BOG system, shows the DFSM propulsion system more efficient than DFDE system.

TI  - Energy- and cost-efficiency analysis of greenhouse gas emission reduction using slow steaming of ships: case study RO-RO cargo vessel
AB  - The International Maritime Organization introduced two energy efficiency indexes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships. One of the short-run solutions is to reduce ship speed. The present research calculates the cost-effectiveness of reducing CO2 emissions and the improved Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) corresponded to the reduced Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) due to slow steaming. As a case study, RO-RO cargo vessel has been investigated. Reducing ship speed by 10% and 40% will reduce CO2 emission by 27.05% and 78.39% with cost-effectiveness of 121.2 $/ton CO2 and 287.6 $/ton CO2, respectively. The attained EEDI values will be improved by 2.04% and 35.81% with the reduced EEOI values by 8.76% and 70.65%, respectively. Although ship slow steaming by 40% would comply with the required EEDI for the first and the second phases, the complied EEDI value needs to be further reduced by 7% in the year 2025.

TI  - Estimation of the Efficiency of Vessel Speed Reduction to Mitigate Gas Emission in Busan Port Using the AIS Database
AB  - To mitigate marine atmospheric pollution causing greenhouse gas (GHG) and a threat to coastal residents' health in dense hub port cities, the Vessel Speed Reduction (VSR) programs were implemented in the Republic of Korea. Spatial analysis of the efficiency of the VSR programs is essential to monitor and improve the present programs. In the present study, the efficiency of the VSRs from the Busan Port (BP), including North Port (NP) and Gamcheon Port (GP), were analyzed. A bottom-up activity-based approach using automatic identification system (AIS) data was introduced herein for the estimation of spatial marine gas emission in real time. The BP has implemented the VSR program since 2020; thus, this study spatially analyzed marine gas emissions in the areas in 2019 and 2020 to demonstrate the efficiency of VSR. To demonstrate the VSR programs in the aspect of the comparison of gas emissions in each year, the total annual fuel consumption in each year is divided by the total arrival ships' GT respectively. According to the comparison of the spatial gas emission inventory between two years in the designed area, 19.2\% of the annual marine gas emissions per ships' GT in BP in 2020 were reduced with the implementation of the VSR program. The spatial analysis clearly showed the mitigation of the ships' gas emissions along the passageway to BP. The spatial analysis of the efficiency of the VSR program will be useful basic data to reflect the local gas emission state on the improvement of the VSR program and newly established environmental regulations.

TI  - Environmental Balance of Shipping Emissions Reduction Strategies
AB  - Maritime shipping is regarded as the most efficient mode of transport; however, its contribution to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions and the health issues related to shipping activity near residential centers cannot be neglected. In recent years, the efforts of regulators, ship operators, and port authorities have led to actions for ship emissions reduction to improve shipping's environmental performance. This work builds on an activity-based methodology that allows the estimation of emissions and examines environmental effects of slow steaming, fuel regulations, near-port speed-reduction schemes, and cold ironing. Pollutant emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and black carbon are modeled. A linear programming model minimizes fuel consumption through speed differentiation on a shipping line's routes based on fuel costs and binding regulations in each segment of the journey. Although the examined emissions-reduction actions may have a positive regional environmental effect by cutting emissions, it is possible that additional emissions are generated elsewhere because of increased sailing speeds beyond regulated areas. Trade-offs between pollutants are observed for reduction actions that may have a positive effect on some emission species but at the same time result in additional particulate matter and black carbon emissions. The presented framework allows key actors to conduct comprehensive studies and design improved emissions reduction actions with fewer negative impacts in other areas.

TI  - The potential of LNG as a ship fuel in the mediterranean sea
AB  - The environmental restrictions set by International Maritime Organization Marine Pollution -Annex VI on heavy fuel sulfur (SOx) content in international shipping emissions are already in application. No more than 0.10% of sulfur content in ship exhaust gas is allowed in Sulfur Emission Control Areas, including the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, North America (including most of US and Canadian Coast), and the US Caribbean ECA. To respect environmental restrictions, especially SOx emissions limits, ship owners and operators can still use heavy fuel oil and marine gas oil as bunker fuels as long as the NOx/SOx emissions are limited by using adequate technologies. Another option which fulfills emission regulations is the LNG as a bunker fuel. The use of LNG as a ship fuel offers many advantages mostly the emission regulation respect. LNG is the only fuel that can meet current and future requirements for the major types of emissions. The pollutants reduction depends on the technology used in engines.

TI  - An advanced control method for fuel cells - Metal hydrides thermal management on the first Italian hydrogen propulsion ship
AB  - As International Maritime Organization set 2030 and 2050 targets to reduce CO2 emissions in maritime sector, the investigation of innovative clean solution as hydrogen fuel cells for clean energy generation onboard is gaining more and more value. The present study investigates the thermal integration between PEM fuel cells and metal hydrides (for hydrogen storage) on board the first Italian zero-emissions ship with hydrogen and batteries propulsion, named ZEUS, built by Fincantieri Yard and launched in 2022. A model-based approach is developed to ensure the system's control at different load demands for the vessel, including transient conditions. The study focuses on the most critical conditions for fuel cells during navigation, namely from maximum to minimum power and vice-versa. Load reduction does not imply particular issues, while load maximum increase may cause some problems in terms of stability, negatively affect fuel cell stacks lifetime. Three solutions are investigated and compared to solve the problem to achieve a safe and robust control system: (i) decrease the current ramp for fuel cells from 50 to 10 A/s; (ii) introduce an intermediate load step; (iii) adopt an advanced Model Predictive Control strategy.

TI  - MODELLING THE IMPACTS OF UNCERTAIN CARBON TAX POLICY ON MARITIME FLEET MIX STRATEGY AND CARBON MITIGATION
AB  - The maritime transport industry continues to draw international attention on significant Greenhouse Gas emissions. The introduction of emissions taxes aims to control and reduce emissions. The uncertainty of carbon tax policy affects shipping companies' fleet planning and increases costs. We formulate the fleet planning problem under carbon tax policy uncertainty a multi-stage stochastic integer-programming model for the liner shipping companies. We develop a scenario tree to represent the structure of the carbon tax stochastic dynamics, and seek the optimal planning, which is adaptive to the policy uncertainty. Non-anticipativity constraint is applied to ensure the feasibility of the decisions in the dynamic environment. For the sake of comparison, the Perfect Information (PI) model is introduced as well. Based on a liner shipping application of our model, we find that under the policy uncertainty, companies charter more ships when exposed to high carbon tax risk, and spend more on fleet operation; meanwhile the CO2 emission volume will be reduced.

TI  - Reducing the carbon intensity of international shipping â€“ The impact of energy efficiency measures
AB  - The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has set a target to reduce the carbon intensity of shipping, or CO2 emissions per transport work, by at least 40% by 2030 from 2008 levels. While short-term measures which focus on improving energy efficiency have been implemented, their impact on carbon intensity trends of international shipping over time has not been quantified. This study quantifies and attributes the contribution of various driving factors to the overall change in carbon intensity of international shipping by ship type. The carbon intensity changes of each ship type are quantitatively linked to the overall carbon intensity target of the IMO. The study results highlight that reductions in carbon intensity at the ship-type and global level have been largely a result of decreases in energy intensity from 2012 to 2018 but reductions became smaller in the later period (2015â€“2018), underscoring the limits to energy efficiency measures. Furthermore, this study highlights the additional insights that can be drawn on the transport mode and freight activity profiles from the joint analysis of demand and supply-side indicators, revealing not only the changes in freight activity and capacity utilization, but also the shifts in capacity miles travelled for different shipping modes.

TI  - AIS-Based Scenario Simulation for the Control and Improvement of Ship Emissions in Ports
AB  - Maritime transport is a major mode of transportation. Over 80\% of international freight is carried by this mode. A port is a hub of ships and freight in maritime transport. Because of growing environmental concerns, how to effectively monitor, control, and improve ship emissions in a port has become a challenge for port administrations. This study combines automatic identification systems (AIS), ship emission estimation model (SEEM), geographic information system (GIS) mapping, and a scenario simulation technique to create a ship emission scenario simulation model (SESSM) for mapping and assessing current ship emissions alongside various ``what-if{''} improvement options in a port area. A case study of the Port of Keelung in Taiwan is used to illustrate and verify the proposed model. In this case, the distribution and density of ship carbon emissions are mapped, with the ship berthing status being identified as the primary source of ship emissions. Meanwhile, nine ``what-if{''} scenarios based on various combinations of speed policies and shore power supplies are simulated and analyzed. The results show that the proposed scenario simulation model is an effective tool to assess various ``what-if{''} emission improvement options and to identify key factors for emission reduction. The effect of shore power supply on carbon emission reduction is significantly greater than speed policies. If investment costs are an issue, a balanced emission improvement option is suggested by combining a new speed policy and 50\% shore power supply.

TI  - Relation analysis on emission control and economic cost of SCR system for marine diesels
AB  - In order to meet the IMO Tier III emissions regulations and reduce environmental pollution, many ocean-going vessels have installed the marine SCR system to reduce NOx emissions. However, the investment cost and operation cost of the marine SCR system, as well as the factors affecting the SCR cost are still the problems that need to be studied. In this paper, MAN S46 diesel engine matched SCR system was taken as the research object, and a cost calculation model of Marine SCR system based on cost analysis method has been proposed. The relationship between SCR system cost and some factors such as unit capacity, unit running time and inlet NOx concentration have been analyzed. The research we have done suggests that operating time, NOx inlet concentration, and emission limits are the three main important factors in the operating cost of an SCR system. Among the various secondary costs of operating costs, the reducing agent cost, fuel increase cost, and indirect annual cost account for 60\%, 24\%, and 7\%, respectively. Moreover, the results suggest that the unit denitration cost of the matched SCR system is highly affected by the power of the diesel engine and annual running time. This study demonstrated clearly the relationship between emission control and economic cost of SCR system for marine diesels and was expected to provide a theoretical basis for sustainable development in marine environmental protection policies.

TI  - Ship emissions around China under gradually promoted control policies from 2016 to 2019
AB  - Ship emissions and coastal air pollution around China are expected to be alleviated with the gradual implementation of ship domestic emission control area (DECA) policies. However, a comprehensive post-assessment on the policy's effectiveness is still lacking. This study developed a series of high-spatiotemporal ship emission inventories around China from 2016 to 2019 based on an updated Ship Emission Inventory Model (SEIM v2.0) and analyzed the interannual changes in emissions under the influence of both ship activity increases and gradually promoted policies. In this model, NOx, SO2, PM and HC emissions from ships in China's inland rivers and the 200 Nm (nautical miles) coastal zone were estimated every day with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees based on a combination of automatic identification system (AIS) data and the Ship Technical Specifications Database (STSD). The route restoration technology and classification of ocean-going vessels (OGVs), coastal vessels (CVs) and river vessels (RVs) has greatly improved our model in the spatial distribution of ship emissions. From 2016 to 2019, SO2 and PM emissions from ships decreased by 29.6 \% and 26.4 \%, respectively, while ship NOx emissions increased by 13.0 \%. Although the DECA 1.0 policy was implemented in 2017, it was not until 2019 when DECA 2.0 came into effect that a significant emission reduction was achieved, e.g., a year-on-year decrease of 33.3 \%, regarding SO2. Considering the potential emissions brought by the continuous growth of maritime trade, however, an even larger SO2 emission reduction effect of 39.8 \% was achieved in these 4 years compared with the scenario without switching to cleaner fuel. Containers and bulk carriers are still the dominant contributors to ship emissions, and newly built, large ships and ships using clean fuel oil account for an increasingly large proportion of emission structures. A total of 4 years of consecutive daily ship emissions were presented for major ports, which reflects the influence of the step-by-step DECA policy on emissions in a timely manner and may provide useful references for port observation experiments and local policy making. In addition, the spatial distribution shows that a number of ships detoured outside the scope of DECA 2.0 in 2019, perhaps to save costs on more expensive low-sulfur oil, which would increase emissions in farther maritime areas. The multiyear ship emission inventory provides high-quality datasets for air-quality and dispersion modeling, as well as verifications for in situ observation experiments, which may also guide further ship emission control directions in China.

TI  - Research on energy consumption monitoring and control method of energy saving and emission reduction for hybrid ships

Therefore, effective energy consumption monitoring and emission control methods in the process of ship operation have attracted great attention in related fields. Therefore, this study optimized the structure of the energy consumption monitoring equipment for hybrid ships, and achieved the energy consumption monitoring and control by effectively collecting the energy consumption data of hybrid ships. The application of real-time monitoring system for ship energy consumption can better monitor the energy consumption of hybrid ships and realize the treatment and control of energy conservation and emission reduction according to the monitoring results. At the same time, according to the current situation of ship energy consumption management, through the analysis of the characteristics of ship operation and diesel engine fuel system, this study proposed a low loss, high precision mass flowmeter, to achieve the requirements of energy conservation and emission reduction control. Based on this, strengthening ship basic management, saving Marine fuel and reducing pollution can achieve a win-win situation between economy and environment.

TI  - Safety and Reliability Analysis of an Ammonia-Powered Fuel-Cell System
AB  - Recently, the shipping industry has been under increasing pressure to improve its environmental impact with a target of a 50\% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, compared to the 2008 levels. For this reason, great attention has been placed on alternative zero-carbon fuels, specifically ammonia, which is considered a promising solution for shipping decarbonisation. In this respect, a novel ammonia-powered fuel-cell configuration is proposed as an energy-efficient power generation configuration with excellent environmental performance. However, there are safety and reliability concerns of the proposed ammonia-powered system that need to be addressed prior to its wider acceptance by the maritime community. Therefore, this is the first attempt to holistically examine the safety, operability, and reliability of an ammonia fuel-cell-powered ship, while considering the bunkering and fuel specifications. The proposed methodology includes the novel combination of a systematic preliminary hazard identification process with a functional and model-based approach for simulating the impact of various hazards. Furthermore, the critical faults and functional failures of the proposed system are identified and ranked according to their importance. This work can be beneficial for both shipowners and policymakers by introducing technical innovation and for supporting the future regulatory framework.

TI  - Modeling the interactions among green shipping policies
AB  - Many policies and practical measures have been designed for emission reduction in shipping. Many have studied their contribution to emission reduction and impacts on the shipping industry without considering their interactions. This study analyzes how a change in one policy or measure affect the others using a system pulse model. The results suggest that the factors influencing shipping emissions are inter-dependent, and the developed systematic shipping emission model fluctuates periodically. We find that slow steaming is actually not effective in emission reduction in the long-run as it impacts the implementation of other policies. It poses a high demand for the adoption of the EEDI (Energy Efficiency Design Index) policy so as to promote the application of advanced technologies in the shipbuilding process. It also suggests that although the implementation of the EEDI policy can promote the adoption of the EEOI (Energy Efficiency Operating Index) policy, the EEOI policy actually relieves the demand for the EEDI policy.

TI  - LNG-fuelled fishing vessels: A systems engineering approach
AB  - Air emissions from fishing vessels must be reduced to comply with progressively stringent environmental regulations. Among the available solutions, liquefied natural gas (LNG) fuel may represent a promising solution, particularly from an environmental perspective. However, the use of LNG as a marine fuel creates different types of hazards than those that exist for traditional fuels. In addition, the increased complexity, safety requirements, and space required for LNG installation increase the capital cost. This article uses a systems engineering approach to clarify the technical aspects of LNG-fuelled systems, their potential implementation costs, and the expertise and training required to operate them safely. Ship owners can use such an approach to aid decision-making and trade-off analyses. Naval architects may also benefit from better information management. Finally, crews may better understand the logic behind the safety actions they are instructed to take. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Methanol as a Fuel for Marine Diesel Engines
AB  - Maritime transportation is the most important transportation type since 90% of world trade is carried. There are 96,295 ships in operation all over the world, and more than 300Â million tons of fuel is consumed annually. A significant amount of emissions are emitted when ships are in operation. There are strict emission rules and regulations that are entered into force by the International Maritime Organization. To reduce shipping emissions and comply with the emission rules and regulations, there are various technologies and methods, including engine modifications, after-treatment systems, and alternative fuels. In todayâ€™s maritime transportation, the use of alternative fuels on ships increases its popularity. Methanol is one of the promising alternative fuels for future maritime transportation. Although methanol-fueled ships are low in number now, methanol has the potential to increase in usage on ships in the future. There is a scant amount of study and a lack of knowledge about methanol usage on marine diesel engines since it is the new fuel for maritime transportation. The methanol combustion at marine diesel engines is needed to be discussed because it is a unique fuel that can provide high engine efficiency and low emissions than diesel fuel. This chapter covers information about the status of maritime transportation, international maritime emission rules and regulations, emission mitigation technologies and methods, methanol at maritime transportation, methanol properties, and combustion concepts, and the methanol partially premixed combustion strategy for maritime transportation. Lastly, the summary section comprises the chapter results. One of the main findings of the chapter is using methanol as an alternative fuel can reduce the different types of regulated emissions at maritime transportation at once without applying additional equipment while providing more efficient marine diesel engines. Another finding is the methanol partially premixed combustion (PPC) strategy showed high engine efficiency than the conventional marine gas oil-fueled diesel engine with lower CO2 and NOX emissions. The sulfur-free structure of methanol does not emit SOX emissions and the low-carbon chain structure of the methanol molecule extremely decreases PM emission formation. This chapter confirms that the methanol PPC can be a solution for marine engines to comply with emission regulations and more efficient engine operation from low load to high load.

TI  - Environmental and health consequences of shore power for vessels calling at major ports in India
AB  - To reduce local air pollution, many ports in developed countries require berthed ships to use shore-based electricity instead of burning diesel to meet their electricity requirement for loads such as lights, cargo-handling equipment, and air conditioning. The benefits of this strategy in developing countries remain understudied. Based on government data for all major ports in India, we find that switching from high-sulfur fuel to shore power reduces hoteling emissions of particulate matter (PM2.5) by 88%; SO2 by 39%; NO x by 85%; but increases CO2 emissions by 12%. Switching from low-sulfur fuel reduces hoteling emissions of PM2.5 by 46% and NO x by 84% but increases SO2 emissions by 240% and CO2 emissions by 17%. The lifetime cost savings from the switch to electricity are $73 M for high-sulfur fuel and $370 M for low-sulfur fuel. We estimate that switching from high-sulfur fuel to shore power might avoid at most a couple of dozen premature deaths each year, whereas switching from low-sulfur fuel could lead to a slight increase in premature mortality. Therefore, policymakers must first clean up power generation for shore power to be a viable strategy to improve air quality in Indian port cities. Â© 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Reducing cost and environmental impacts through hybrid power options
AB  - Power solutions for seagoing vessels have typically been designed to enable operation at maximum economic speeds based on hydrodynamic considerations, and to ensure that vessels have the necessary power to be seaworthy and maneuverable in heavy weather and in high sea states. Historically, fuel costs have been low compared to fixed and other variable costs, but more recently, rising fuel prices and environmental concerns have made it more attractive to reduce fuel consumption through lower steaming speeds. Since speed reduction drastically reduces power requirements, it has become common to operate at 15 to 50% of the installed power in calm to moderate sea conditions. When engines operate at low power, fuel consumption per kWh produced power increases slightly, while the emissions of exhaust gases increase rapidly due to incomplete combustion. This study investigates flexible hybrid power solutions, i.e. power take out (PTO), power take in (PTI) and batteries in combination with internal combustion engines. The focus is on the full operational range from being idle at berth to the peak power needed in critical situations in high sea states. Our results indicate that hybrid solutions are cost-competitive with traditional engine setups. They also reduce the environmental impact, including greenhouse gas emissions and cost effectively satisfies IMOâ€™s energy efficiency requirements (EEDI).

TI  - A new strategic approach of energy management onboard ships supported by exergy and economic criteria: A case study of a cargo ship
AB  - The fossil-source energy consumption in maritime transportation is an important input which affects the operating costs. In this market, cargo ships with potentially represents up to 78% of the total global maritime transportation are considered as vessels with a high fossil fuel consumption. These ships need effective energy management to reduce environmental pollution from fossil fuel and to manage sustainable energy-related costs in commerce. In this study, an energy efficiency strategy framework was developed primarily to support efficient energy management as the decision support element in ships. Considering the ship's cruising processes, energy efficiency and economic effectiveness were examined as based on the exergy approach and the economic criteria. In this context, two new criteria were developed: the â€œEnvironmental Cost Index (ECI)" and the â€œEnergy Efficiency Index (EEI)". According to the analyzes results, the energy and exergy efficiencies in the sample ship's cruising processes were found as 38.33% and 35.82% respectively, and the calculated ECI was 0.41. These reference values showed that the fuel-related loss cost of the ship was 19.05%. At the end of the study, some evaluations were made on the implementation of the energy efficiency strategy and its effects. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - The concept of â€œgreen shipâ€: New developments and technologies
AB  - Ocean-borne trade has increased steadily over the past few decades and is expected to continue to play a crucial role in the globalized world economy. This growth has brought with air quality and marine pollution problems and global climate change risks unless ship emissions are controlled. Thus, International Maritime Organization (IMO) aims to guide to the sectors how to reduce carbon footprint by technical and operational measures. IMO also emphasize on the importance of a global approach in advanced improvements to energy efficiency and emission reduction. This approach led to maritime industry to seek for new technological developments to reduce ship-based CO2, NOx and SOx emissions, to improve energy efficiency and to develop propulsion power such as sulphur scrubber system, LNG fuel for propulsion, advanced rudder and propulsion system and etc. The purpose of this paper is to examine aforementioned new technological developments and to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of them.

TI  - Ship Power Plant Decarbonisation Using Hybrid Systems and Ammonia Fuel-A Techno-Economic-Environmental Analysis
AB  - The shipping sector decarbonisation has attracted great attention due to the sector contribution to worldwide carbon emissions. This study aims at investigating the techno-economic- environmental performance of different ship power plants to identify sustainable solutions for a case study cargo ship. Four scenarios, considering conventional and hybrid power plants, the latter with installed batteries, both using marine gas oil and ammonia fuels, are analysed to estimate the pertinent lifetime key performance indicators characterising their economic and environmental performance. Additionally, taxation schemes of varying extent are considered, and a sensitivity analysis is carried out on the most uncertain input parameters, namely, fuel prices and capital cost. This study results demonstrate that the hybrid plant using ammonia exhibits the lowest environmental footprint associated with 66\% carbon emission reduction, whilst increasing the lifetime cost by 40\%. Taxation schemes close to 340 EUR per CO2 tonne are required to render it economically viable whilst meeting the IMO targets for 2050 on CO(2 )emissions reduction. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the economic parameters is highly sensitive to fuel price and the capital expenditure.

TI  - Consideration of Energy Efficiency Operational Index evaluation
AB  - The Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) is a monitoring tool for managing ship and fleet efficiency performance over time. The EEOI enables operators to measure the fuel efficiency of a ship in operation and to gauge the effect of any changes in operation, e.g. improved voyage planning and more frequent propeller cleaning, or the introduction of technical measures such as waste heat recovery systems or a new propeller. The EEDI index implies a minimum acceptable level in terms of ship energy efficiency, quantified by CO 2 emissions and relative to freight and transport distance. Supported values will be reduced depending on the implementation phases. It expects the implementation of this index to drive the deployment of innovative shipboard technologies to influence their energy efficiency. The values of the reduction factors have a decreasing trend during the implementation periods, reaching a minimum of 30% reduction of the pollutant emissions in the years 2025 compared to the levels before the implementation of this index. EEDI has been conceived as the largest and most powerful segments of the maritime industry. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Outlook of future implementation of PEMFC and SOFC onboard cruise ships
AB  - According to third IMO GHG Study shipping is responsible of about 2, 6% of world CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) emissions. The dangerous effect on people is increased because emissions are concentrated in coastal areas. IMO and other bodies are engaged in imposing measures to reduce GHG emissions and improve the overall ship's energy efficiency. There are many technical and operational improvements that can help to reach these goals, but hydrogen and fuel cells remain one of the best candidates to substantially reduce emissions and fuel consumption. This paper gives an outlook of possible fuel cells applications in the marine sector and analyses the potential of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) and Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) for the on-board installation. The analysis shows the advantages that fuel cells can give in terms of emissions reductions and fuel saving, but also highlights some challenges that designers will face when implementing these technologies on a cruise ship. Both PEMFC and SOFC application in the marine sector suffer of the lack of standards and regulations from IMO and Classification Societies and high acquisition cost. While PEMFC are ready for marine application, SOFC are still in a study phase for on-board implementation. Also, the type of fuel used by these generators and the possibility of heat recovery can influence their application on-board cruise ships. Â© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.

TI  - Energy savings by optimization of thrusters allocation during complex ship manoeuvres
AB  - The International Maritime Organization adopted a strategy to reduce the total annual GHG emissions from international shipping by at least 50% by 2050, compared to 2008 levels. The European Union proposed an even farther reaching transformation: the European Commission adopted a set of proposals to make the EUâ€™s transport policies fit for reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. Therefore, all industrial actions in line and consistent with these strategies are essential. One of such activities may be a gradual transition from the most common independent controls of transport shipsâ€™ thrusters, propellers, and rudders to an integrated, power optimized, 3 degrees of freedom joystick control. In this paper, the full mission bridge simulator (FMBS) research on potential energy savings and, consequently, a GHG emission reduction, while steering a RoPax twin-screw ferry equipped with bow thrusters by a joystick control, is presented. The task of navigators engaged in the research was to steer the vessel either via classic engine, rudder, and thruster levers or via a joystick while (1) following the predefined straight track, (2) rotating at the turning area, and (3), finally, crabbing (moving sideways) until stopping at the quay fenders. The conclusions are that energy savings of approximately 10% can be expected for berthing manoeuvres controlled by a joystick, compared to independent actuatorsâ€™ controls. These conclusions have been drawn from a statistical analysis of the shipâ€™s energy consumption during typical manoeuvring phases of 18 berthing operations performed in FMBS. Â© 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Economic analysis of power factor correction for marine vessels
AB  - Application of power factor correction techniques to energy savings in practical ship electric power systems have been studied. From an economic viewpoint, the energy-saving benefits due to introduction of the power factor correction option and investment costs required should be considered in planning of the investment for judging whether the improvement option is economic or not. This paper aims to establish a set of benefit-cost analysis model for power factor correction utilized in ships. The active power, reactive power, power factor, and diesel electric engine's oil consumption for a practical merchant vessel power system during different operating conditions are measured and analyzed. The possible benefits for energy-saving and emission reduction after installing automatic power factor corrector (APFC) devices are identified and a benefit-cost analysis of APFC for a practical bulk carrier is performed by using two standard economic analysis methods. Sensitivity of basic economic parameters to analysis results is also performed to reduce effects of input parameters on the analysis results and to determine the critical parameters. The proposed analysis model developed in this paper can assist ship building corporations and ship owners in assessing performance of the power factor improvement option and building business cases for determining return on investment (ROI).

TI  - Marine Solution for PEM Fuel Cells in AC or DC Grid
AB  - Hydrogen fuel cells are a promising source of energy in shipping, due to its zero carbon and zero pollution operation. This article is focused on the use of PEM fuel cells, which are currently the most common in maritime sector. The often use of PEM fuel cells is also because of international and regional regulations, which require significant reduction of emissions. Operation of PEM fuel cells onboard vessel brings potential risk, however when safety countermeasures are ensured PEM fuel cells are safe to use as well as any other power sources. Vessels are typically equipped with either AC grid or DC grid. Both has different benefits, which are useful in certain applications. Due to that, PEM fuel cells must be able to be integrated into AC and DC grid. Individual examples of integration and their requirements are described in this article.

TI  - Sandfirden's gas-engines: LNG - A viable alternative fuel for reduced emissions on ships
AB  - Sandfirden Technics has developed a gas-powered engine based on the Scania 12 and 16 liter diesel engine series. Compressed natural gas is deemed less suitable for ships, because of the large storage volume. This gas-engine has been adapted for use in marine generator sets and as propulsion engines. An important step in LNG propulsion is the conversion from the liquid in the tanks to the gas at the right pressure and temperature for use in the engines. Besides the ecological advantage, LNG power can result in lower fuel costs, reduced port-tariffs, and even access to certain areas with strict emission norms. Sandfirden is perhaps most known for their generator sets. The company is working on a series of gensets for use onboard superyachts. Contrary to the commonly used gensets in the superyacht industry, the Sandfirden sets will feature a diesel engine with common-rail fuel injection independent of the engine's rpm.

In this paper, we study the sailing speed optimization problem for a ship operating on a route having a specified sequence of calling ports with time windows for calling time. The considered problem can be formulated as a non-linear program. We derive the intrinsic properties of the problem and develop an optimal algorithm based on the properties. Computational experiments show that the developed algorithm in this paper is efficient in finding an optimal solution.

TI  - Development of 1 MW-class HTS motor for podded ship propulsion system
AB  - To reduce fuel consumption and lead to a major reduction of pollution from NOx, SOx and CO2, the electric ship propulsion system is one of the most prospective substitutes for conventional ship propulsion systems. In order to spread it, innovative technologies for the improvement of the power transmission are required. The high temperature superconducting technology has the possibility for a drastic reduction of power transmission loss. Recently, electric podded propulsions have become popular for large cruise vessels, icebreakers and chemical tankers because of the flexibility of the equipment arrangement and the stern hull design, and better maneuverability in harbour, etc. In this paper, a 1 MW-class High temperature superconducting (HTS) motor with high efficiency, smaller size and simple structure, which is designed and manufactured for podded propulsion, is reported. For the case of a coastal ship driven by the optimized podded propulsion in which the 1MW HTS motor is equipped, the reductions of fluid dynamic resistance and power transmission losses are demonstrated. The present research \& development has been supported by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).

TI  - Bunkering: Must measure
AB  - Heavy fuel oil (HFO) is a residual product of the refinery process and is inconsistent in quality. For optimum combustion, some processing is required and many vessels are fitted with viscosity booster units or fuel conditioning units. Emerson?s Micro Motion Viscomaster Viscosity meters accurately measures the viscosity, density, and temperature of the HFO enabling it to be treated as necessary. The Viscomaster meters are tolerant of harsh environments such as onshore and offshore power plants, and provide reliable, accurate control with little or no maintenance or recalibration. Emerson?s Micro Motion Coriolis mass flowmeters have been used for the measurement of fuel oil to provide accurate, mass-based measurement. Using the Modbus communications protocol, the mass flowmeter sends data to a fuel efficiency control system, which collects information from the flowmeter and other onboard systems, optimising ship operations. Emerson?s new Micro Motion Certified Marine Bunker Measurement Solution, which includes the Micro Motion Elite Coriolist meter, Series 3000 transmitter and Marine Bunker Transfer Package, is the first traceable, transparent, mass-based measurement system for HFO bunkering and monitors fuel deliveries, minimizing disputes between barge and ship..

TI  - AN APPROACH FOR SELECTING GREEN ENERGY SYSTEMS FOR NEW GENERATION NAVAL VESSELS
AB  - Ship-borne air emissions have a significant impact on air pollution as well as global warming, especially in coastal areas. CO2 is the major component of the greenhouse gases (GHGs). Naval vessels constitute a notable part of the total fleet of sea going ships and the fuel burnt in the energy systems of naval vessels is strongly proportional to CO2 emissions. Existing fossil fuel reserves are apparently decreasing, so interrelated fuel efficiency and emissions should be handled together. The increasing need for ensuring safety at sea and protecting sea resources, results in an increase in the need to build new vessels that will provide these missions. Offshore patrol vessels (OPVs) are reasonable solutions to perform these missions compared to naval vessels such as frigates and corvettes, in terms of high investment and life cycle costs. Main air emission source of an OPV is energy system which consists of prime movers and auxiliary engines. This system should comply with mission profile assigned to OPV, providing high fuel efficiency and low air emission. This study analyzes fuel efficiency and proposes an approach for estimation of CO2 emissions of four alternative energy systems for a new generation OPV at the conceptual design phase.

TI  - A bond graph approach to improve the energy efficiency of ships
AB  - High fuel consumption coupled with increasing fuel prices, emission regulations and increasing concern about the environment, act as incentives to reduce the energy consumption of ships. However, different barriers hinder the adoption of cost-effective energy saving measures by ship owners and operators. These barriers are the reason for the existence of an 'energy efficiency gap' between the current level of energy efficiency and the potential for development of higher order efficiency. Imperfect information regarding the current level of energy consumption of vessels, availability and application of energy saving measures, and the impact of adopting these measures, form a group of so called 'information barriers'. 1 The main objective of this article is to reduce those information barriers, as faced in shipping and more specifically in the fishing sector. The bond graph methodology is presented as a potential solution to these issues. It is utilized as a modeling and simulation method by which to visualize energy flow in a fishing vessel. The bond graph method is employed to estimate the fuel consumption of the vessel under different operational conditions: Steaming, trawling and hauling of the fishing gear. It is also applied in pinpointing the major energy consuming apparatuses onboard the vessel. In this way knowledge regarding the current levels of energy consumption can be increased. The main energy consumers can then be studied to further improve energy efficiency knowledge and subsequently reduce the energy efficiency gap of the fishing vessel. Finally, the effectiveness of implementing a slow steaming strategy as a possible energy saving mechanism is studied. Copyright Â© 2014 by ASME.

TI  - Optimization-Based Power and Energy Management System in Shipboard Microgrid: A Review
AB  - The increasing demands for reducing greenhouse emissions and improving fuel efficiency of marine transportation have presented opportunities for electric ships. Due to the complexity of multiple power resources coordination, varied propulsion loads, changeable economical, and environmental requirements, power/energy management system (PMS/EMS) becomes essential in both designing and operational processes. The existing literature on PMS/EMS can be categorized into rule-based and optimization-based approaches. Compared to the rule-based PMS/EMS, which relies heavily on human expertise, as well as predefined strategies and priorities, the optimization-based approaches can offer more efficient solutions and are more widely used nowadays. This article provides a comprehensive review of the marine optimization-based power/energy management system and discusses the future trends of PMS/EMS in ship power systems.

TI  - Supporting Predictive Maintenance of a Ship by Analysis of Onboard Measurements
AB  - Ship hull and propeller fouling has a severe impact both on fuel costs and on greenhouse gas emission, thus, it is an important subject to consider when developing a maintenance plan to enhance energy efficiency and reduce gas emissions from ships. This paper presents a two-step approach for evaluating the actual propulsive performance of a ship through analyzing continuous onboard measurement. First, the onboard monitored data are corrected for the wind and wave effects using fast and transparent empirical methods. Second, the corrected data are filtered based on hydrodynamic criteria. A case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology. Subsequently, the processed data are analyzed by mathematical tools to derive an engine power-rpm curve to represent the actual propulsive performance of the ship. By comparing the derived curve against the nominal curve for engine design, it is possible to identify the deterioration of the ship's condition, which is the key task in developing the identification capability that is needed in a proactive maintenance procedure. This methodology is expected to support the maritime sector in combating climate change by reducing the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from ship operations.

TI  - THE FUTURE OF SHIP'S PROPULSION IN MARITIME TRANSPORT
AB  - Due to high fuel prices on the world market and regulations for emission reduction, nowdays many shipping companies are forced to experiment with different types of ship propulsion in order to minimize fuel consumption and meet the criteria for CO2 release into the atmosphere, and thereby to reduce the transportation costs. This article will give an insight into the range of alternative energy sources and various possible alternative solutions for ship propulsion. Some of these projects will enter commercial operation in late 2014. A new generation of ships is a technical concept that is highly advanced and very practical for the environment in the near future. This article will also present the amount of fuel savings and CO2 emission reduction compared to conventional ships, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of different solutions for ship propulsion. In the next few years, we can expect a further major investment in the development of vessels with greater fuel efficiency and reduced CO2 emission by 30\%. That is very useful information that must be taken into account, as the fuel prices on the world market are growing, and requirements for the allowable amount of exhausted CO2 in the atmosphere are becoming more stringent.

TI  - Prediction of the annual performance of marine organic Rankine cycle power systems
AB  - The increasing awareness about the environmental impact of shipping and the increasingly stricter regulations introduced by the International Maritime Organization are driving the development of solutions to reduce the pollutant emissions from ships. While some previous studies focused on the implementation of a specific technology, others considered a wider perspective and investigated the feasibility of the integration of various technologies on board vessels. Among the screened technologies, organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power systems represent a viable solution to utilize the waste heat contained in the main engine exhaust gases to produce additional power for on board use. The installation of ORC power systems on board ships could result in a reduction of the CO2 emissions by 5 â€“ 10 %. Although a number of methods to derive the optimal design of ORC units in marine applications have been proposed, these methods are complex, computationally expensive and require specialist knowledge to be included as part of a general optimization procedure to define the optimal set of technologies to be implemented on board a vessel. This study presents a novel method to predict the performance of ORC units installed on board vessels, based upon the characteristics of the main engine exhaust gases and the ship sailing profile. The method is not computationally intensive, and is therefore suitable to be used in the context of large optimization problems, such as holistic optimization and evaluation of a ship performance given the operational profile, weather and route.

TI  - TOPSIS method implementation on slow steaming alternatives evaluation
AB  - Maritime shipping represents a valuable and economical mode of international cargo transportation. Also maritime transport operates from combustion of fossil fuels which represents a substantial part of the total greenhouse gas emission and contributes significant amounts of greenhouse gases (GHG) associated with global warming. International Maritime Organization has developed technical and operational measures to control the CO2 emissions from ships and additionally vessels today are designed with better energy efficiency. An important operational management aspect is slow steaming where as an action on ship intentionally reduces vessel service speed and results the reduction of fuel costs. This paper investigates the relationship and impact among slow steaming cost reduction and furthermore the carbon emission reduction, shipment delay and dangerous anchoring due to ports limitations, through the evaluation with Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution. This method represents a multi-criteria decision analysis method and is a useful tool for decision makers facing multi criteria processes in order to investigate the value of an alternative compared with the ideal solution. It also evaluates the decisions that should be taken into consideration from the ships managers for the most advantageous operation of the ship. Â© 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

TI  - THE MODELLING AND OPTIMAL CONTROL OF A HYBRID PROPULSION SYSTEM FOR AN ICE -CAPABLE SHIP
AB  - Due to the effect of global warming, navigation on the Northern Sea Route (NSR) has become a more economical and reliable choice for international cargo transportation. In some ways, global warming has increased the opportunity of shipping activities in the Arctic region and hence the need for ice-capable vessels. NSR shipping provides benefits for international trade, but challenges still exist. Although conventional direct drive propulsion system connected to 2 stroke marine engine is normally considered the most efficient approach for long-range transport, for icebreaking operation which requires prime movers to work at partial load, conventional mechanical propulsion systems generally have poor fuel efficiency and high emissions. Moreover, the harmful gases produced by ships trading in NSR have a significant impact on the Arctic climate. Moreover, a traditional mechanical drive icebreaker with a diesel engine is required to operate at high torque, low rpm during icebreaking operation. Thus conventional diesel engine that isn't optimised to operate at this point would be inefficient and would produce black carbon due to incomplete combustion, which has the potential to cause ice, snow, and cloud albedo out of proportion with normal pattern, thus lead to serious impacts on the Arctic environment and eco-system. Arctic ship propulsion systems have been developing since the 19th century, with modifications such as the use of diesel electric propulsion systems and nuclear power propulsion systems which can ideally meet the requirements of ice breaking operation (low speed and high torque), however, drawbacks still exist in these systems, such as poor fuel efficiency at low speeds for diesel electric propulsion and for nuclear power, there are limitations such as high initial cost, management of nuclear waste and the fact that the required deep knowledge of nuclear technology is mastered by few countries. Hybrid propulsion is a new technology for ice-capable ships, which can address the partial loading efficiency problem in diesel-electric propulsion by charging and discharging a battery energy storage unit which can allow the ship to work in zero-emission mode in some sensitive areas. In this paper, detailed modelling, primary control strategies (voltage and frequency stability) and efficiency analysis of system components such as the motor, generator, battery and conversion devices etc. are and implemented in software, and then the whole power system is simulated with a secondary control strategy (load power sharing and battery aging concern) in both ice and open water load conditions. The results from the diesel electric system and hybrid system total fuel consumption within a target journey are compared to investigate the advantage of the hybrid system, which show up to a 40\% fuel consumption reduction for hybrid propulsion arrangement. A tertiary control strategy for energy management is analysed and implemented in the system to further reduce system fuel consumption.

TI  - A semi-empirical ship operational performance prediction model for voyage optimization towards energy efficient shipping
AB  - Voyage optimization is a practice to select the optimum route for the ship operators to increase energy efficiency and reduce Green House Gas emission in the shipping industry. An accurate prediction of ship operational performance is the prerequisite to achieve these targets. In this paper, a modified Kwon's method was developed to predict the added resistance caused by wave and wind for a specific ship type, and an easy-to-use semi-empirical ship operational performance prediction model is proposed. It can accurately predict the ship's operational performance for a specific commercial ship under different drafts, at varying speeds and in varying encounter angles, and then enables the user to investigate the relation between fuel consumption and the various sea states and directions that the ship may encounter during her voyage. Based on the results from the operational performance prediction model and real time climatological information, different options for the ship's navigation course can be evaluated according to a number of objectives, including: maximizing safety and minimizing fuel consumption and voyage time. By incorporating this into a decision support tool, the ship's crew are able to make an informed decision about what is the best course to navigate. In this study the Energy Efficiency of Operation (EEO) is defined as an indicator to illustrate the ratio of main engine fuel consumption per unit of transport work. Two case studies are carried out to perform the prediction of ship operational performance for Suezmax and Aframax Oil Tankers, and the results indicate that the semi-empirical ship operational performance prediction model provides extremely quick calculation with very reasonable accuracy, particularly considering the uncertainties related to the parameters of interest for the case study data. Within the case studies, the additional fuel consumption caused by the combined hull and propeller fouling and engine degradation is included in the model as a time-dependent correction factor. The factor may assist the ship owner/operator to determine the hull coating selection, and/or the dry-docking and main engine maintenance strategy. Â© 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - On the research and development of super eco-ship project
AB  - The global warming problem is concerned in the world. The Japanese Government has formalized the acceptance of Kyoto Protocol on 4th of June 2002. Under the Protocol, Japan has an obligation of greenhouse gas (CO2 etc) emissions reduction of 6% below 1990 levels for the first commitment period of 2008-2012. The restriction concerning the exhaust of NOx and SOx by ships is discussed in the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). Under the Ministry's of Land Infrastructure and Transport (MLIT) national research project named the Super Eco-Ship Project, the National Maritime Research Institute of Japan (NMRI) has been played major role of it since April 2001. Super Eco-Ship would embody a technical breakthrough in meeting certain requirements of coastal shipping such as reducing the burden on the environment and the logistics costs and improving the living and working conditions on board. Super eco-ship has highly efficient electrical propulsion system featuring the podded propulsor with contra-rotating propeller (CRP). Advanced concept and systems are applied in the research and development of the Super Eco-Ship. Flexibility in the arrangement of main engine and in the hull form design is realized by the electric propulsion system. New design tools based advanced concept and methodology are applied. Hull form design method by means of CFD simulation and CAD are performed to design optimum hull form for electric propulsion system. The high propulsive efficiency due to the combination with the optimum hull design and podded propulsor enables the reduction of CO2 compared with the conventional ship. The podded propulsor with CRP enables drastically good maneuverability and flexible control system in ship operation as well as high propulsive efficiency. The pilot becomes easy operation in berthing time by the control system of the podded propulsor. In August 2004, a reliability test run of a prototype of the propulsor including the motors and sealing/bearing was completed in a dock.The practicality of poded propulsor with CRP was confirmed from this result. In this paper, the results of this test and environmental assessment of super eco-ship is reported. Copyright Â© 2005 by The International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers.

TI  - Application Internet of Things (IoT) to calibrate with IMO 2050 Decarbonization Charters and Phase Out Greenhouse Gases from the Shipping Industry of Bangladesh
AB  - With the application of the Internet of Things (IoT ) linking all the ships and other water vessels with different types of sensors and surveillances for reading, observation and monitoring the existing system, Bangladesh Maritime Safety Administration can calibrate with IMO 2050 Decarbonization Charter and phase out the emission of greenhouse gases to a significant level from the ships and vessels operating in the domestic and international waterways. Furthermore, according to the study, the adaptive measures, thriving in the enforcement of the environmental safety regulations, adoption of new technologies, use of alternative fuels, speed and trim optimisation and speed reduction, applications of route planning, upskilling the workforce, etc. in the context of Bangladesh, eventually create a broader and reliable hub to collect specific data from the source of polluters and help Bangladesh Maritime Safety Administration improve energy efficacy performance of the ships, especially in Annual Efficiency Ratio (AER) Energy efficiency Existing Ship index (EEXI), Energy efficiency Design index (EEDI), Carbon Intensity Index (CII) and in Fuel Oil Reduction Strategy (FORS) and thus reducing carbon emission to a significant level.Collecting primary and secondary data, the paper empirically studies the prospects of installing sensor technologies and surveillances in all the ships and water vessels for fuel efficiency, engine efficiency, carbon emission, methane emission, volatile organic compound emission, and other GHG emissions. The paper maintains that being able to holistically connect all the vehicles operating under Bangladesh Maritime Safety Administration to a single network commonly could create a comprehensive way to facilitate operational best practices, enforcing and implementing the regulatory laws effectively, preparing the budget well, and proposing changes in places where they are duly applicable.While assessing the measurements to align with IMO 2050 Decarbonization Charters, the focus has been duly placed on the cost of technologies, shortage of resources, human capital shortage, administrative challenges, policy constraints, operational challenges, and environmental impacts. Again, IMO 2050 Decarbonization parameters were carefully studied before mapping out the integration of IoT into systems. The possible measures categorised as the short-term, middle-term and long-term instruments are proposed to be implemented phase by phase, encouraging the stakeholders to enhance technical cooperation and capacity-building activities. The study also highlights how the application of IoT and augmented intelligence in the shipping industry can be a breakthrough technology, helping the stakeholders to enforce IMO 2050 Decarbonization Charter, formulate policies appropriately, use alternative low carbon and zero-carbon fuels and innovative technologies to enhance further the energy efficacy of the ships and other water vehicles. The paper concludes that giving tax rebates and financial incentives for going green and being aligned with IMO 2050 Decarbonization Charters could inspire the stakeholders. Â© 2022 IEEE.

TI  - LNG COLD ENERGY POTENTIAL FOR CONTAINER SHIP AND FERRY
AB  - WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤â€™s patented cold energy recovery system has demonstrated operational savings on the LNG-fuelled ferry Viking Grace by reducing the amount of electricity consumed in HVAC system cooling compressors. To further improve, a new study from Denmark looks beyond that to the potential of LNG cold energy for vessels with dual-fuel engines. Main engine exhaust gases, jacket cooling water, seawater and an intermediate glycol-water system for HVAC cooling were considered as heat sources for the ORC unit. The maximum power output was obtained using butane as the working fluid for the seawater and glycolwater configurations, iso-pentane for jacket water and n-pentane for engine exhaust gases. The savings attainable when using the LNG cold energy to further cool engine scavenge air (to increase engine efficiency and reduce NOx emissions) were highly dependent on relative air humidity. High humidity meant that up to 39% of the heat was used to condense the water vapor rather than to cool the air in tropical conditions. The estimated fuel savings under ISO conditions (ambient temperature of 25Â°C and relative humidity of 30%) ranged from 0.41% to 0.44%. The system combines thermal energy storage with a waste heat recovery system based on ORC technology, and it was evaluated for a hypothetical ferry requiring 1MW of auxiliary power. The results suggest that the proposed system could reduce CO2 emissions by 8% and could be economically competitive with the installation of battery systems to supply power during port stays, especially for newbuilds.

TI  - Evaluation of ammonia fueled engine for a bulk carrier in marine decarbonization pathways
AB  - This study highlights that in addition to using ammonia in the maritime sector and integrating it into the ship concept, it is a challenging option for shipowners in terms of capital and operational expenditures. In this study, the typical marine-type fuels used in the main engines of a bulk carrier were compared to ammonia in a Techno-Economic Analysis. The bulk carrier features a conventional main engine system, and operational data was acquired to determine how much ammonia was consumed. The ship is classified using the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) and the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII). To determine its economic viability, Monte-Carlo Simulation is utilized. In addition, a cost scenario for in-service bulk carriers was developed, with an emphasis on their application. Ammonia is used to minimize petroleum consumption, but it is not cost-effective for long-term financial sustainability, and the installation cost is more than 5 million USD. MAC calculation was made according to NPV values and CO2 reduction results and 3816.42 $/tCO2e was obtained. According to the article, ammonia is more suitable for newly built marine vessels. With the study, a method that can be used in the feasibility studies of different alternative technologies for the existing ships of the shipping companies is presented in the literature. Â© 2022

TI  - Revised energy efficiency design index parameters for inland cargo ships of Bangladesh
AB  - A generalized CO2 emission benchmark (energy efficiency design index) cannot be established for inland ships in a similar fashion like the one established by International Maritime Organization for seagoing vessels. Difference in environmental, geographical and economic conditions, for example, shallow and restricted water effects, different fuel quality (to reduce operational cost), reduction in speed, increase in engine power, reduction in carrying capacity and cargo availability, forbids the direct use of energy efficiency design index as formulated by International Maritime Organization. These conditions have been addressed at first in this research, and revision of some parameters is presented for calculating energy efficiency design index for inland cargo ships of Bangladesh. Moreover, the ship data stored at different organizations of Bangladesh deviate from the existing ship data. As a result, the collected data have undergone through several verification processes. Based on the verified real data, CO2 emission benchmark for inland cargo ships of Bangladesh was established. This benchmark is one of the world's first CO2 emission benchmark for inland cargo shipping. This benchmark will force ship designers of Bangladesh to design more energy efficient ships that will consume less energy per ton-mile. It is interesting to note that the energy efficiency design index curve for inland cargo ships using revised energy efficiency design index parameters is below the energy efficiency design index curve using International Maritime Organization formulation. The prime reasons behind this fact have also been explained in this research.

TI  - A review of ship energy efficiency research and directions towards emission reduction in the maritime industry
AB  - To improve energy efficiency of ships, initiatives have been taken by the international and regional regulatory bodies, ship owners, shipping lines, and other involved stakeholders. While existing literature has investigated ship energy efficiency from different perspectives, a comprehensive review on measures, practices, policies, feasibility, and alternatives remains absent. This study presents a retrospective review of ship energy efficiency literature by utilizing a hybrid review method that combines bibliometric and content analysis approaches. For bibliometric analysis, the bibliometrix package in the R software was used in combination with the VOSviewer software. The outcomes of bibliometric analysis are the most ranked articles, journals, authors, and institutions related to ship energy efficiency research. The bibliographic coupling analysis identified five research clusters: (1) decarbonization and emission reduction measures, (2) speed management, (3) policy and regulations, (4) economic and organizational factors, and (5) alternative energy sources. Future research directions are proposed for each cluster. Â© 2022 The Author(s)

TI  - Leading companies on propulsion
AB  - Alewijnse Marine Systems is developing low emission propulsion systems and other related innovations. Alewijnse Marine Systems are increasingly taking a leading role in developing and rolling out the new low emission propulsion systems that are becoming a regular part of the maritime landscape. These systems can vary greatly in both size and sophistication. Alewijnse applied its expertise to integrate the relatively untested fuel cell technology with the control, storage and propulsion systems that together make it a viable alternative to conventional engines. A good example of where this thinking is being applied is the E3 tug that Alewijnse is currently developing with Smit Engineering and Damen Shipyards. In fact, automation is seen as the key by integrators like Alewijnse to minimizing emissions from current technologies. The new paradigm in marine propulsion systems remains a varied mix of new and existing technologies, but the use of clean electricity to propel vessels is clearly the way of the future.

TI  - Ship energy management for hybrid propulsion and power supply with shore charging
AB  - Hybrid technology in marine vehicles can significantly reduce fuel consumption and local CO2 emissions. It has been applied successfully to several ship-types, mostly with conventional, rule-based, strategies. To further improve performance, intelligent control strategies are necessary. This work, inspired by automotive research in Energy Management Strategies, applies the Equivalent Consumption Minimisation Strategy (ECMS) to a ship powered by a hybrid propulsion plant with hybrid power supply that can be recharged with renewable shore power. This hybrid configuration has the additional challenge to determine the optimal power-split between three or more different power sources, in real-time, and to optimally deplete the battery packs over the mission profile. To this end, a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear optimisation Problem is formulated and solved by combining Branch &amp; Bound and Convex optimisation. Dynamic Programming (DP) is used to benchmark the real-time strategies, which are also compared to the current rule-based (RB) controller. Simulation results of a case study tugboat with validated models show that, with unknown load demand, 6% additional fuel savings can be achieved with ECMS. Â© 2018

TI  - Machinery matters: Contra-rotating propellers for diesel electric ships
AB  - WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤ and Japan's IHI Marine United Inc (IHIMU) have concluded a cooperation agreement under which the contra-rotating propeller (CRP) systems developed by IHIMU will be incorporated into WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤'s propulsion solutions used on board diesel-electric driven ships. The cooperation agreement mainly covers the European market, where the environmental demands on shipping operations are becoming increasingly stringent. The HIMU CRP system will achieve 10% better propulsion efficiency compared to conventional diesel-electric propulsion systems, and is applicable to all vessels from small ships to large LNG carriers. This efficiency improvement translates into significant fuel savings, thus enabling a short return on investment as well as reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The application of the CRP system could be extended to include hybrid (mechanical driven and electric driven) propulsion systems, and four-stroke mechanical systems, at a future stage.

TI  - Fuel Cell Power Systems for Maritime Applications: Progress and Perspectives
AB  - Fuel cells as clean power sources are very attractive for the maritime sector, which is committed to sustainability and reducing greenhouse gas and atmospheric pollutant emissions from ships. This paper presents a technological review on fuel cell power systems for maritime applications from the past two decades. The available fuels including hydrogen, ammonia, renewable methane and methanol for fuel cells under the context of sustainable maritime transportation and their pre-processing technologies are analyzed. Proton exchange membrane, molten carbonate and solid oxide fuel cells are found to be the most promising options for maritime applications, once energy efficiency, power capacity and sensitivity to fuel impurities are considered. The types, layouts and characteristics of fuel cell modules are summarized based on the existing applications in particular industrial or residential sectors. The various research and demonstration projects of fuel cell power systems in the maritime industry are reviewed and the challenges with regard to power capacity, safety, reliability, durability, operability and costs are analyzed. Currently, power capacity, costs and lifetime of the fuel cell stack are the primary barriers. Coupling with batteries, modularization, mass production and optimized operating and control strategies are all important pathways to improve the performance of fuel cell power systems.

TI  - Numerical Analysis of the Effects of Ship Motion on Hydrogen Release and Dispersion in an Enclosed Area
AB  - Hydrogen is an alternative to conventional heavy marine fuel oil following the initial strategy of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Although hydrogen energy has many advantages (zero-emission, high efficiency, and low noise), it has considerable fire and explosion risks due to its thermal and chemical characteristics (wide flammable concentration range and low ignition energy). Thus, safety is a key concern related to the use of hydrogen. Whereas most previous studies focused on the terrestrial environment, we aim to analyze the effects of the ship's motion on hydrogen dispersion (using commercial FLUENT code) in an enclosed area. When compared to the steady state, our results revealed that hydrogen reached specific sensors in 63\% and 52\% less time depending on vessel motion type and direction. Since ships carry and use a large amount of hydrogen as a power source, the risk of hydrogen leakage from collision or damage necessitates studying the correspondence between leakage, diffusion, and motion characteristics of the ship to position the sensor correctly.

TI  - A dynamic simulation of a cryogenic power generation system on an LNG fuelled vessel based on ORC technology
AB  - With the increasing growth of the LNG market, using LNG as a fuel becomes more appealing to ship owners and operators. More ships of various types on order-book choose LNG fuelled propulsion systems to replace conventional HFO and marine diesel fuelled system. This study proposes a new waste energy power generation system to recover the exhaust heat of marine engines and use the cryogenic energy from LNG fuel evaporation systems. The system is built on a main cycle, i.e. an Organic Rankine cycle (ORC), with a bottom cycle with the LNG direct expansion process. The selected working fluid operates in the temperature range of -104 to 200?. The operating data from a real LNG fuelled case ship is applied as the input data in the dynamic simulation using the software - Siemens LMS Imagine.Lab AMESim. Multiple working conditions are studied in the simulation in terms of the different fuel consumption levels of the case ship. The simulation of the proposed system shows a significant improvement in thermal efficiency and power production in comparison to the existing waste energy power generation system on board the case ship.

TI  - Green routing design in short seas
AB  - In recent years, with the development of shipping industry, the mass of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions originating from ships is also increasing rapidly. To reduce the GHG emissions from ships, designing the optimised routes with higher energy use efficiency is becoming more important for ships navigating in short seas. Based on the innovative application of energy efficiency operational index (EEOI), a route optimisation model is established. To solve the model, we divide one single voyage into several voyage segments and consider the variable speed across voyage segments. Then the navigation strategy is used to find out the sailing route of the minimum EEOI value, this sailing route is called as the green route. Finally, numerical experimental results show that the EEOI values of the experimental groups which used the optimised navigation method are 4.67\%-16.95\% lower than that of the control group. The results demonstrate that the green route designed in this paper can effectively improve the energy use efficiency of ships.

TI  - Scheduling of power generations for energy saving in hybrid AC/DC shipboard microgrids
AB  - Trending in the maritime industry nowadays, is towards an energy efficient and fuel saving. Moreover, concerns regarding global warming issues caused by massive air pollution in sea area by the ship combustion engine and depletion of fossil fuels have attracted attention and opportunities for many parties. The electric propulsion has been used in ship for many years. It has triggered the concept of all electric ship where all electrical equipment including electric propulsion, connected to the electrical networks to achieve better fuel consumption with less emission. However, the main generation in the ship is still diesel generators. Connecting more generator in parallel is normal practice to cater the load. However, due to the nature of non-linear characteristic in thermal unit, such as diesel generator, based on specific fuel consumption (SFC) curve, the generator loading is not efficient when running the generator with low load factor or higher SFC. Thus, the effective energy scheduling is needed among the generators so that the generators is operated in optimum point. The case study in this paper is ferry, with a conversion from traditional diesel mechanical power to electric propulsion powered by diesel generator as a main source and energy storage as secondary source. This paper analyzes how much the operating cost of the scheduled system implemented in this practical electric ferry based on an estimation of SFC curve considering the dynamic load profile.

This sustainability will become a reality by implementation of autonomous ship (AS), which is considered as an alternative and may carry the potential to increase the profitability of shipping company. The elimination of crew, the introduction of innovative technology and adoption of new ship design on board of this kind of ship will participate positively in energy saving and environmental protection. For an insitu study, a hundred of conventional ships (CS) have been visited, their energy consumption and environmental impact are assessed taking into consideration the trading area, navigation scenarios, power capacity and number of crew members. In this paper, we assess and quantify the positive impact on energy saving and environmental pollution prevention resulting from the implementation of AS. For this the facilities related to crew living are enumerated and the impact of their elimination on energy saving and environmental pollution prevention is presented. Other ship design concepts are proposed to enhance the energy-saving and environmental protection are proposed. A benchmarking of CS and AS in term of energy saving and environmental pollution prevention is presented.

TI  - Managing Shipboard Energy: A Stochastic Approach Special Issue on Marine Systems Electrification
AB  - The efficient utilization of energy is of high importance for shipboard applications, for environmental and economic reasons as well as maximized vessel operation. The electrification of marine systems facilitates the storage and generation of energy from multiple sources, offering the potential for energy savings, due to the flexibility associated with electric systems. In this paper, an energy management system (EMS) based on bond graph system models used in conjunction with a stochastic search algorithm is proposed and developed. The EMS optimizes the configuration of the vessel's onboard machinery system based on the current operating condition. The approach is universal, with the system model and optimization routine being separate and distinct. The effectiveness of the proposed EMS is demonstrated using a real operating profile of a roll-on/roll-off vessel fitted with a hybrid machinery configuration including energy storage, onshore power supply, and photovoltaic generation. The results show fuel savings of around 23\% compared with current fuel consumption levels.

TI  - A Preliminary Study on an Alternative Ship Propulsion System Fueled by Ammonia: Environmental and Economic Assessments
AB  - The shipping industry is becoming increasingly aware of its environmental responsibilities in the long-term. In 2018, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) pledged to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 50\% by the year 2050 as compared with a baseline value from 2008. Ammonia has been regarded as one of the potential carbon-free fuels for ships based on these environmental issues. In this paper, we propose four propulsion systems for a 2500 Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit (TEU) container feeder ship. All of the proposed systems are fueled by ammonia; however, different power systems are used: main engine, generators, polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). Further, these systems are compared to the conventional main engine propulsion system that is fueled by heavy fuel oil, with a focus on the economic and environmental perspectives. By comparing the conventional and proposed systems, it is shown that ammonia can be a carbon-free fuel for ships. Moreover, among the proposed systems, the SOFC power system is the most eco-friendly alternative (up to 92.1\%), even though it requires a high lifecycle cost than the others. Although this study has some limitations and assumptions, the results indicate a meaningful approach toward solving GHG problems in the maritime industry.

TI  - Gas engines and LNG shipping: Clean air pressures drive gas engine concepts
AB  - The benefits of gas as a fuel for ships are presented. At present, LNG is the cleanest fuel available for ships, eliminating all SOx emissions, reducing NOx emissions by 80% and CO2 emissions by 20%. There are three aspects why everyone is not burning it, i.e., technical, logistic, and economic. Norway has the LNG to deliver as bunkers and it has the desire to cut both air pollution and marine pollution risk. The move away from steam turbines powered by boil off gas to diesel engines on LNG carriers is the biggest step for a long time. Today, many new LNG carriers on order will be powered either by boil off gas driving a diesel electric installation, with dual fuel arrangements for the passage with no gas on board, or large two-stroke diesel engines burning conventional fuel, with the boil of reliquefied on board.

TI  - Criteria and Decision Support for A Sustainable Choice of Alternative Marine Fuels
AB  - To reach the International Maritime Organization, IMO, vision of a 50\% greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction by 2050, there is a need for action. Good decision support is needed for decisions on fuel and energy conversion systems due to the complexity. This paper aims to get an overview of the criteria types included in present assessments of future marine fuels, to evaluate these and to highlight the most important criteria. This is done using a literature review of selected scientific articles and reports and the authors' own insights from assessing marine fuels. There are different views regarding the goal of fuel change, what fuel names to use as well as regarding the criteria to assess, which therefore vary in the literature. Quite a few articles and reports include a comparison of several alternative fuels. To promote a transition to fuels with significant GHG reduction potential, it is crucial to apply a life cycle perspective and to assess fuel options in a multicriteria perspective. The recommended minimum set of criteria to consider when evaluating future marine fuels differ somewhat between fuels that can be used in existing ships and fuels that can be used in new types of propulsion systems.

TI  - Experimental research on the energy efficiency of a parallel hybrid drive for an inland ship
AB  - The growing requirements for limiting the negative impact of all modes of transport on the natural environment mean that clean technologies are becoming more and more important. The global trend of e-mobility also applies to sea and inland water transport. This article presents the results of experimental tests carried out on a life-size, parallel diesel-electric hybrid propulsion system. The efficiency of the propulsion system was analysed for two modes of operation (electric and diesel) and for different engine speeds and loads. Analysis of the impact of using a hybrid propulsion system on fuel consumption was carried out on a case study vessel and for six actual journeys. The use of hybrid propulsion in zero emission mode enables up to four times higher energy efficiency when compared to a conventional drive, while reducing CO2 emissions and air pollution to zero, as well as a hundred-fold reduction in noise emissions. High flexibility in the operation of such a drive enables the use of intelligent power control technology (smart propulsion).

TI  - Advanced Optimized Weather Routing for an OceanGoing Vessel
AB  - Based on current growth patterns in the global economy, there are projections that there will be an overall increase in the emissions of harmful gases from ships. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) requires the preparation of management plans to improve the efficiency of ship navigation. Moreover, shipping companies should pay careful attention to fuel consumption and environmental conservation. In this paper, we propose a newly developed weather-routing optimization technology that focuses on fuel-consumption minimization and energy-efficiency operational indicator (EEOI) minimization while on voyages. We consider the constant variations in the sea and weather conditions, including wind, wave, and current conditions. This is achieved by performing a cost-function minimization. The cost function is calculated by performing an entire maneuvering simulation from a transoceanic voyage's starting point to its end point by solving horizontal differential equations of motion such as those related to the yaw, sway, and surge. The simulations consider the ship's hull force, propeller thrust, rudder force, wave force, and wind force. Both sets of results obtained in this study for the optimal routes are reasonable because the values of EEOI and FOC are reduced compared with the values for the great circle route, which is the shortest path between the two points. On the other hand, the optimized route in the EEOI minimization calculation does not provide the FOC minimum value.

TI  - Organic Rankine cycle-based waste heat recovery system combined with thermal energy storage for emission-free power generation on ships during harbor stays
AB  - The pollutant emissions from ships in harbor are a pressing concern due to their direct impact on the health of the population. The use of electric-battery propulsion is a viable solution to reduce the emissions in coastal areas, but it is only applicable to small ferries. Large cruise ships commonly utilize shore power connection to provide onboard electricity, avoiding pollution during harbor stays. However, this solution is not applicable during short stays. This paper presents a novel and energy-efficient way to supply zero-emission power during harbor stays of marine vessels. The proposed system combines the use of a thermal energy storage and a waste heat recovery system based on the organic Rankine cycle technology. The objective of this work is to investigate the technical feasibility of the proposed system and to compare its cost-effectiveness with the alternative solution of using batteries during harbor stays. The study is based on a case study of a hypothetical ferry requiring 1 MW of auxiliary power during harbor stays. The results suggest that the proposed system would require the installation of a storage tank of around 82 m3, and that it could be economically competitive with the battery-based solution, especially when considering its installation on newly built ships. Lastly, it is estimated that the installation of the proposed concept would lead to reduction of the ferry's carbon dioxide emissions by 8%. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Analysis and modeling the energy system of a chemical tanker by leap
AB  - Maritime transportation has been a cost-effective option among other transport modes. Meanwhile, this demand has been increasing day by day because of the expanding global economy. The ships are one of the most important transport and trade vehicles in the world; 90% of the world trade is carried out by maritime transport, and this sector plays a crucial role in climate change and global warming because it is one of the key sectors leading to emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas (GHG). In other sectors that lead to CO2 emissions, i.e., energy production, manufacturing industry, and heating in residences, energy efficiency has been improved and emissions have been reduced significantly. However, there has been no net reduction in the transport sector; total CO2 emissions have also increased because of the continuous increase in freight and passenger traffic, although efficiency has increased. Increasing the energy efficiency of a ship allows for fuel consumption reduction and GHG emissions. In this study, the energy system of a chemical tanker ship was analyzed and then modeled by using the long-range energy alternatives planning system, a widely used platform for energy policy analysis and climate change mitigation assessment, including a comprehensive energy flow diagram, namely, reference energy system. A base scenario was developed, and the ship's energy systemwas convenient to be analyzed and evaluated in terms of technical, economic, and environmental aspects, including low-emission development strategies, to comply with marine engine regulations of the International Maritime Organization.

TI  - Indication of the Target Alternative Fuel for Shipping
AB  - The article presents the regulations of the International Maritime Organization aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions from international shipping. One of the main objectives is to search the alternative to fossil fuels. The main problem is the lack of indication of the target fuel for shipping. The current changes, forced by international regulations, are made by the decisions of shipowners who themselves are looking for an alternative fuel that will enable them to continue their activities. Attempts have been made to use fuels considered as transient, which will be used in the perspective of about 10 years. However, this is too short a time compared to the life of the ship (20â€“30 years). This will force another change in the type of fuel used on ships still in operation, which will result in additional costs associated with the adaptation of the shipâ€™s power plant fuel systems to a different type of fuel. The article evaluates the changes that currently taking place. Scenarios of the most likely directions of changes in a perspective of 2050 have been indicated. Â© 2022, Politechnika Lubelska.

TI  - Power System Design Optimization for a Ferry Using Hybrid-Shaft Generators
AB  - Ferry contributing a significant amount of greenhouse gas is one of the critical vessels to be electrified. Designing a power system for a ferry with hybrid-shaft generators is different from designing a power system for other vessels because of its fixed route. More clearly, ferries repeatedly travel between their port of origin and port of destination, and before the next voyage, the battery must be recharged to the initial state so that the optimal energy management scheme can be repeatedly applied. Furthermore, the flexibility of hybrid-shaft generators, which allow more fuel saving, increases design complexity. In this paper, a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem is first formulated, and a power management algorithm with an initialization step for fulfilling the battery recharging requirement and a refinement step for minimizing the fuel consumption is proposed. The simulation results obtained from data of an actual ferry show that the proposed power management algorithm can fully recharge the battery and consumes less fuel than a rule-based power management scheme. Simulations also reveal that fuel consumption depends on available shore power, highlighting the necessity to develop charging infrastructure for practical electrification. Because of its speed, the algorithm can support hardware sizing, e.g., battery sizing.

TI  - Considerations on the Effect of Slow-Steaming to Reduce Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Ships
AB  - Carbon dioxide emissions have become a growing problem worldwide. Global institutions are addressing this problem and developing solutions. Countries that are aware of this problem are implementing regulations that affect global industry and, in particular, maritime transport. Considering that the combustion process, namely, diesel, remains the main energy conversion process on board ships, the question arises: what is the best solution to reduce pollutant emissions? Coastal countries have taken various measures to reduce the emission of harmful gases into the marine environment. The problem with these measures is that it is difficult to accurately predict their impact. This paper looks at one of these measures (slow-steaming) to determine how it affects carbon dioxide emissions from different types of ships and their modes of operation. Engine room simulators were used to study two marine power plants under different operating conditions. Fuel consumption was measured, i.e., flows from heavy fuel oil and diesel oil service tanks to all consumers, and carbon emissions were calculated accordingly. The study showed a large reduction in carbon dioxide emissions in the case of a modern power plant ship, and large deviations when all operating modes were compared.

TI  - Sofc ammonia fuel supply system safety assessment
AB  - The shipping industry is currently navigating an era of unprecedented uncertainty, brought upon by the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the advancements in digital technologies and digitization, and the ever-increasing importance of the environmental performance. The shipping industry in its efforts to reduce its environmental footprint has targeted a 50% reduction of its GHG emissions by 2050, benchmarked to 2008 levels. In this respect, the development of marine type ammonia (NH3)-powered Fuel Cells (FCs) is a prominent solution, as liquid NH3 has very good safety (fire and explosion) and energy characteristics and its use as a marine fuel in FCs can result in efficient power generation with excellent environmental performance. Nonetheless, prior to its wider acceptance by the maritime community the NH3 related technologies must prove that they are at least as safe as the existing systems. This is addressed in the present research. In detail, this paper identifies the main hazards associated with NH3 FCs and subsequently examines their impact on the overall system to further gauge the risk. This methodology includes the novel combination of a systematic Hazard Identification (HAZID) process with a functional and modelbased approach for simulating the impact of various hazards.

TI  - Performance prediction method for fouled surfaces
AB  - Increase in ship energy efficiency is one of the main goals set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). In this sense the IMO identified the significance of the control and management of the hull fouling. The weed or grass stage is often seen as the beginning stage of the ship hull fouling, while the effects of soft fouling on the ship resistance and propulsion characteristics as well as on the fuel oil consumption are mistakenly underestimated. A new method for the assessment of the effect of fouling on the ship resistance and propulsion characteristics is proposed. The applicability of the proposed method is shown by comparison of the obtained resistance and propulsion characteristics using this method and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach. Within this paper the effect of soft fouling on the ship energy efficiency is evaluated. Utilizing the proposed method, the increase in the fuel oil consumption and the CO2 emission is determined for handymax bulk carrier on the route Halifax-Rotterdam for certain surface conditions. The potential benefits of the hull and the propeller cleaning are highlighted from both an economic and environmental point of view. On the observed route the potential savings in the fuel oil costs could be up to 38,000 $, while reducing the CO2 emission up to 327 t. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - An integrated approach towards cost-effective operation of ships with reduced GHG emissions
AB  - The paper describes the unique combination of technical and operational measures aimed at making a large shipping fleet among the most environmentally focused while ensuring cost-effective operation. These measures are in line with a recently established environmental strategy that applies to the shipping fleet. With the focus on Greenhouse Gases (GHG), CO 2 emission levels and foreseen future trends are provided on the basis of the developments for existing vessels and planned new-buildings, with particular focus on container vessels and tankers. Due to the introduction of new technology, a modernized fleet and focus on fuel efficiency in design and operations, emission levels have decreased significantly over the past years. Despite acknowledging the importance of NOx, SOx and particulate matter as GHG emissions, these are not for primary source consideration in this paper since CO 2 is the main issue in terms of GHG for large shipping companies.

TI  - Energetic and Ecological Effects of the Slow Steaming Application and Gasification of Container Ships
AB  - One of the short-term operational measures for fuel savings and reducing CO2 emissions from ships at sea is sailing at reduced speed, i.e., slow steaming, while the gasification of the ship represents an important mid-term technical measure. In this study, the energetic and ecological benefits of slow steaming and gasification are studied for a container ship sailing between Shanghai and Hamburg. Resistance and propulsion characteristics in calm water are calculated using computational fluid dynamics based on the viscous flow theory for a full-scale ship, while the added resistance in waves is calculated by applying potential flow theory. The propeller operating point is determined for the design and slow steaming speeds at sea states with the highest probability of occurrence through the investigated sailing route. Thereafter, the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are calculated for a selected dual fuel engine in fuel oil- and gas-supplying modes complying with IMO Tier II and Tier III requirements. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for various slow steaming speeds compared to the design speed at different sea states, and for the gasification of a container ship. For realistic weather conditions through the investigated route, the potential reduction in CO2 emissions per year could be up to 11.66 kt/year for fuel oil mode and 8.53 kt/year for gas-operating mode. CO2 emission reduction per year due to gasification under realistic weather conditions could be up to 22 kt/year.

TI  - Color-Coded Hydrogen: Production and Storage in Maritime Sector
AB  - To reduce pollution from ships in coastal and international navigation, shipping companies are turning to various technological solutions, mostly based on electrification and the use of alternative fuels with a lower carbon footprint. One of the alternatives to traditional diesel fuel is the use of hydrogen as a fuel or hydrogen fuel cells as a power source. Their application on ships is still in the experimental phase and is limited to smaller ships, which serve as a kind of platform for evaluating the applicability of different technological solutions. However, the use of hydrogen on a large scale as a primary energy source on coastal and ocean-going vessels also requires an infrastructure for the production and safe storage of hydrogen. This paper provides an overview of color-based hydrogen classification as one of the main methods for describing hydrogen types based on currently available production technologies, as well as the principles and safety aspects of hydrogen storage. The advantages and disadvantages of the production technologies with respect to their application in the maritime sector are discussed. Problems and obstacles that must be overcome for the successful use of hydrogen as a fuel on ships are also identified. The issues presented can be used to determine long-term indicators of the global warming potential of using hydrogen as a fuel in the shipping industry and to select an appropriate cost-effective and environmentally sustainable production and storage method in light of the technological capabilities and resources of a particular area.

TI  - Incremental costs for reduction of air pollution from ships: a case study on North European emission control area
AB  - In addition to sulphur oxides control, the North and the Baltic Seas have recently been designated as nitrogen oxides control area. Amidst ongoing developments in energy markets and international trade, shipowners have to develop cost-efficient strategies to comply with the new regulation. This study creates and tests a model calculating the incremental costs of abating NOx and SOx emissions under MARPOL Annex VI regulations for the following methods: SCR, HAM and internal engine modifications, marine gas oil, wet scrubbers, and liquefied natural gas propulsion. The model is tested empirically on a broad sample of 244 ships from the Swedish Commercial Fleet database for different operating contexts and fuel prices. Individual ship emission reductions and incremental abatement costs are calculated and the results are presented for the entire studied sample and per ship type class. The study also explores the sensitivity of the chosen abatement methods to cost determinants and to main engine time operation under the light of economic performance and cost-efficiency. The results of the study aim to contribute to company abatement strategy. Â© 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - A Multisource Information System for Monitoring and Improving Ship Energy Efficiency
AB  - Global climate change has attracted an increasing amount of attention by the public. The shipping industry is being scrutinized with regard to improving efficiency and reducing emissions. This paper explores the monitoring technology and efficiency enhancement method for a ship. First, the internal and external factors that affect a ship's energy efficiency are determined and examined. Second, an inland river ship is selected as a research target on which a multisource information system is constructed via the selection and installation of the corresponding sensors on the ship. A series of system tests have also been performed when the ship is in operation. The field tests prove that the established system is adequate for the voyage and that all of the sensors can normally monitor the parameters. In addition, a massive quantity of data for the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are obtained. A grey correlation analysis and regional difference analysis are conducted using these data. The analysis results suggest that the main engine speed has the greatest effect on a ship's fuel consumption and that the voyage environment of the Yangtze River affects a ship's fuel consumption. Finally, a novel ship speed-optimization method that considers the impact of voyage environment is proposed as an energy efficiency enhancement example. This study not only aids shipping companies and ship officers in monitoring a ship's operations but also provides a high-energy efficiency strategy for a ship's operation.

The International Maritime Organization and numerous countries and regions are actively taking various effective measures to reduce pollution from ships. Fuel cell is a power generation device that converts the chemical energy stored in fuel and oxidizer directly into electrical energy, and it is the only electric unit with high efficiency, no pollution, no noise, modularization and continuous operation at present, which has been widely concerned.

TI  - Emissions factors for gaseous and particulate pollutants from offshore diesel engine vessels in China
AB  - Shipping emissions have significant influence on atmospheric environment as well as human health, especially in coastal areas and the harbor districts. However, the contribution of shipping emissions on the environment in China still need to be clarified especially based on measurement data, with the large number ownership of vessels and the rapid developments of ports, international trade and shipbuilding industry. Pollutants in the gaseous phase (carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, total volatile organic compounds) and particle phase (particulate matter, organic carbon, elemental carbon, sulfates, nitrate, ammonia, metals) in the exhaust from three different diesel engine power offshore vessels in China were measured in this study. Concentrations, fuel-based and power-based emissions factors for various operating modes as well as the impact of engine speed on emissions were determined. Observed concentrations and emissions factors for carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, total volatile organic compounds, and particulate matter were higher for the low engine power vessel than for the two higher engine power vessels. Fuel-based average emissions factors for all pollutants except sulfur dioxide in the low engine power engineering vessel were significantly higher than that of the previous studies, while for the two higher engine power vessels, the fuel-based average emissions factors for all pollutants were comparable to the results of the previous studies. The fuel-based average emissions factor for nitrogen oxides for the small engine power vessel was more than twice the International Maritime Organization standard, while those for the other two vessels were below the standard. Emissions factors for all three vessels were significantly different during different operating modes. Organic carbon and elemental carbon were the main components of particulate matter, while water-soluble ions and elements were present in trace amounts. Best-fit engine speeds during actual operation should be based on both emissions factors and economic costs. Â© Author(s) 2015.

TI  - AIS-Based Estimation of Hydrogen Demand and Self-Sufficient Fuel Supply Systems for RoPax Ferries
AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) established new strategies that could lead to a significant reduction in the carbon footprint of the shipping sector to address global warming. A major factor in achieving this goal is transitioning to renewable fuels. This implies a challenge, as not only ship-innovative solutions but also a complete low-carbon fuel supply chain must be implemented. This work provides a method enabling the exploration of the potential of low-carbon fuel technologies for specific shipping routes up to larger sea regions. Several aspects including vessel sizes, impact of weather and shipping routes, emissions savings and costs are considered. The local energy use is determined with proven bottom-up prediction methods based on ship positioning data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) in combination with weather and ship technical data. This methodology was extended by an approach to the generation of a basic low-carbon fuel system topology that enables the consideration of local demand profiles. The applicability of the proposed approach is discussed at hand via a case study on Roll-on/Roll-off passenger and cargo (RoPax) ferries transitioning from conventional fuels to a compressed hydrogen fuel system. The results indicate a potential reduction in emissions by up to 95% and possible system sizes and costs. Â© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Assessment of alternative fuels and engine technologies to reduce GHG
AB  - Current greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from maritime transport represent around 3% of global anthropogenic GHG emissions. These emissions will have to be cut at least in half by 2050 compared to 2008 as adopted by IMO's initial GHG-strategy to be consistent with the Paris Agreement goals. Basically, the required GHG emissions reduction can be achieved through: Design and other technical improvement of ships; Operational Improvement; Fuels with zero or lower GHG footprint; or a combination of these. Fuels with zero or lower GHG footprints are often perceived to be the most promising measure. The motivation for this study has therefore been to investigate these alternative fuels with focus on their feasibility, energy utilization and cost in addition to their GHG reduction potential. The results indicate: First, that fuels with zero or very low GHG emissions will be costly; Second, that these fuels might double or triple the maritime sector's energy consumption in a Well-to-Wake context; Third, if large amounts of renewable electricity becomes available at very low prices, synthetic E-fuels such as E-diesel and E-LNG which can be blended with conventional fuels and used on conventional vessels, will be more commercially attractive than hydrogen and ammonia.

TI  - Energy efficiency and fuel changes to reduce environmental impacts
AB  - Many different emissions from ships are directly related to a ship's fuel consumption. This is particularly true for emissions to air, which are generated during the combustion process in the engines. Hence, improving the conversion process from fuel energy to transport work can be an effective means of reducing ship emissions. Solutions for reducing ship fuel consumption are generally divided into design and operational measures. Design measures primarily include technical solutions implemented when the ship is designed, constructed, and retrofitted, such as weightreduction, hull coatings, air lubrication, improvement of hull design, optimal propulsion systems and harvesting waste energy. Operational measures are related to how the ship or the fleet is operated and include measures such as weather routing, optimal ship scheduling, improved ship logistics, and on-board energy management. Although reducing fuel consumption always generates an environmental benefit, it should be noted that the use of different fuels results in different impacts on the environment for a given energy conversion efficiency. Another way to reduce emissions is therefore related to the type of fuel used on a ship, e.g., diesel fuels, gases, alcohols and solid fuels. However, choosing a fuel is not an easy process because it is influenced by a broad range of criteria, including technical, environmental and economic criteria.

TI  - Lifecycle energy solution of the electric propulsion ship with Live-Life cycle assessment for clean maritime economy
AB  - This study was planned to offer the roadmap for lifecycle clean shipping by addressing the fundamental question of â€˜what are the promising energy solutions for the shipping sector?â€™. This goal was attempted to be achieved by a lifecycle comparative analysis of the viability of three zero-carbon fuels, ammonia, hydrogen, and inland electricity, based on the operational practicality as well as Well-to-Wake environmental impacts. Credible business scenarios were designed with a high-level screening of 27 short-route ferries currently engaged in 26 West-Scotland coastal routes. Then a series of comparative analyses between the diesel and the proposed alternative fuel sources was conducted. While carbon-free fuels are in the early stages of development in the UK, there are various views on how these fuels can be produced, distributed, and used onboard for the clean shipping economy. To determine the optimal energy solutions, all credible scenarios for the upstream pathways for these fuels were developed, based on the current and future prospected UK energy infrastructure and grids. Those scenarios were examined for West-Scotland shipping and extended to the UK targets. Their technical aspects for maritime application were also investigated in consideration of safety, regulation, infrastructural availability, supply chain constraints, barriers, and the downstream emission pathways to their uptake onboard. Ship conceptual designs were briefly conducted to evaluate the systems, technologies, and equipment required for onboard installation to utilise zero-carbon fuels. As a result of the study, when hydrogen was used as a fuel in fuel cells and electricity was supplied as a backup from batteries that store inland power and the solar PV system, GHG emissions were 25.7% of the conventional fossil fuel-using scenario. In addition, it was confirmed that GWP was 22.2% compared to MGO when ammonia was used as fuel without reforming into hydrogen and backup power was supplied from batteries and the solar PV system. It is believed that the analysis results can distinctively demonstrate the adequacy or the inadequacy of current maritime policies for decarbonising shipping. This research finally provides potential solutions for future UK maritime environmental protection and for enhancing the competitiveness of ship owners. In addition, this research concept can serve as a sample that suggests the direction of ideal research for future energy solutions in the marine sector. Â© 2022

TI  - Safety vs. Sustainability â€“ How Much Underpowering of Ships Is Acceptable?
AB  - The present EEDI regulations have a strong impact on ship design. Especially for tankers and bulk carriers, the regulation results in the reduction of the installable main engine power. In 2020, the next EEDI reduction phase is put into force with the consequence that the main engine power of these ships will be reduced even further. The development helps to reduce emissions, especially greenhouse gases, but it puts challenges on ship safety, as the ship must still be maneuverable even in bad weather conditions. Recently, a grounding incident of a bulk carrier sea took place in the German Bight where the ship was dragging its anchor although the main engine was running at full speed. Numerical investigations of this accident showed that the environmental forces acting on the ship were larger than the sum of propeller and anchor forces. This incident was an excellent opportunity to investigate whether our existing numerical calculation methods are able to cope with such kind of incidents and whether it was possible to investigate the root cause of that particular grounding event. The paper gives an overview about the numerical investigations of the grounding event which address course keeping in heavy weather including anchor forces. Additionally, operational aspects of the main engine operation and the propulsion control systems are considered. The ship did not need to comply with the existing EEDI regulations. Therefore, the paper addresses also the effect of reduced main engine power on this particular incident, because it is obvious that reduced main engine power will make such incidents more probable, as limiting environmental conditions for a ship with less power will be less severe and therefore more probable.

TI  - Hybrid ship unit commitment with demand prediction and model predictive control
AB  - We present a novel methodology for the control of power unit commitment in complex ship energy systems. The usage of this method is demonstrated with a case study, where measured data was used from a cruise ship operating in the Caribbean and the Mediterranean. The shipâ€™s energy system is conceptualized to feature a fuel cell and a battery along standard diesel generating sets for the purpose of reducing local emissions near coasts. The developed method is formulated as a model predictive control (MPC) problem, where a novel 2-stage predictive model is used to predict power demand, and a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is used to solve unit commitment according to the prediction. The performance of the methodology is compared to fully optimal control, which was simulated by optimizing unit commitment for entire measured power demand profiles of trips. As a result, it can be stated that the developed methodology achieves close to optimal unit commitment control for the conceptualized energy system. Furthermore, the predictive model is formulated so that it returns probability estimates of future power demand rather than point estimates. This opens up the possibility for using stochastic or robust optimization methods for unit commitment optimization in future studies. Â© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Choose clean energy or green technology? Empirical evidence from global ships
AB  - On January 1st, 2020, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) implemented a new regulation for a 0.50\% global sulphur cap for marine fuels, which was a dramatic decrease from the previous emissions cap of 3.5\%. The new regulation will have an enormous impact on the shipping market. At present, there are different feasible schemes for reducing sulphur emissions from ships. Shipowners need to consider the economic cost, energy feasibility, and other relevant factors of different schemes before making decisions. This paper empirically explores the factors that affect shipowners' energy choices. Based on the new emerging individual ship dynamic data, Automatic Identification System (AIS), and other relevant databases, we apply various data mining methods and a threshold discrete choice model combined with an oversampling technique to conduct quantitative measurements and statistical analyses of factors for each ship type that affect the shipowners' choices. Three groups of indicators, including ship characteristics, shipowner characteristics, and market conditions, are considered in our analysis. In the model, we also address the heterogeneity of the carriers towards environmental awareness. This study provides important practical implications for responding to the new emissions regulations among maritime and maritime-related industries and policymakers.

TI  - Energy effectiveness of ocean-going cargo ship under various operating conditions
AB  - The increasing economic cost and environmental impact of maritime transportation necessitate the reduction of fossil fuel consumption of ocean-going cargo ships. Although fundamental ship propulsion system theory is well-known and is at a mature stage of development, there is still an enormous variety in the assessment methodology of (environmental) transport performance of ships. Furthermore, calibration of ship propulsion system model parameters with testbed, towing tank and full-scale measurement data is rare, as these measurements are both difficult and expensive. Finally, the effects of different power management strategies on the ultimate energy conversion effectiveness of typical cargo ships have rarely been investigated systematically. In this paper these three issues are discussed, addressed and solved for a representative benchmark chemical tanker. This ship was chosen to investigate the so-called energy conversion effectiveness under various propulsion control and electric power generation modes, as ample real ship data is available. The transport performance assessment of the ship's power plant is generalised for hybrid arrangements with either Power-Take-Off or Power-Take-In. The results show that an optimal combination of propulsion control, power management and voyage planning will further reduce the global fuel consumption and CO2 emissions produced by the shipping industry.

TI  - Marine Propulsion Engine Behaviour using Fossil Fuel and Methanol
AB  - Considering the upgoing price of fossil fuel and requirements are becoming more and more stringent regarding pollutant emissions, the need of replacing the fossil fuel with a cheaper and less pollutant one emerges. The TECS software deal with thermal engine calculation problematics in order to determine, for different fuels types (liquid or gaseous), the indicated and effective engine parameters and also for verification, analysis and calculation of thermo-dynamic processes. As a result, the maritime industry is investigating alternative fuels for shipping. Methanol is an attractive alternative because it reduces polluting emissions and is expected to be cheaper in the future. This paper analyses the maritime engine performance when using fossil fuels as well as methanol. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Maintaining marine diesel emissions using performance monitoring
AB  - Ships are an integral part of modern commercial transport, leisure travel, and military system. A diesel engine was used for the first time for the propulsion of a ship sometime in the 1910s and has been the choice for propulsion and power generation, ever since. Since the first model used in ship propulsion, the diesel engine has come a long way with several technological advances. A diesel engine has a particularly high thermal efficiency. Added to it, the higher energy density of the diesel fuel compared to gasoline fuel makes it inherently, the most efficient internal combustion engine. The modern diesel engine also has a very unique ability to work with a variety of fuels like diesel, heavy fuel oil, biodiesel, vegetable oils, and several other crude oil distillates which is very important considering the shortage of petroleum fuels that we face today. In spite of being highly efficient and popular and in spite of all the technological advances, the issue of exhaust gas emissions has plagued a diesel engine. This issue has gained a lot of importance since 1990s when IMO, EU, and the EPA came up with the Tier I exhaust gas emission norms for the existing engine in order to reduce the NOx and SOx. Harsher Tier II and Tier III norms were later announced for newer engines. Diesel fuels commonly used in marine engines are a form of residual fuel, also know as Dregs or Heavy Fuel Oil and are essentially the by products of crude oil distillation process used to produce lighter petroleum fuels like marine distillate fuel and gasoline. They are cheaper than marine distillate fuels but are also high in nitrogen, sulfur and ash content. This greatly increases the NOx and SOx in the exhaust gas emission. Ship owners are trapped between the need to use residual fuels, due to cost of the large volume of fuel consumed, in order to keep the operation of their ships to a competitive level on one hand and on the other hand the need to satisfy the stringent pollution norms as established by the pollution control agencies worldwide. Newer marine diesel engines are being designed to meet the Tier II and Tier III norms wherever applicable but the existing diesel engine owners are still operating their engines with the danger of not meeting the applicable pollution norms worldwide. Here we make an effort to look at some of the measure that the existing marine diesel engine owners can take to reduce emissions and achieve at least levels prescribed in Tier I. Proper maintenance and upkeep of the engine components can be effectively used to reduce the exhaust gas emission. We introduced a pilot program on diesel engine performance monitoring in North America about two years ago and it has yielded quite satisfying results for several shipping companies and more and more ship owners are looking at the option of implementing this program on their ships.

TI  - THE MARINE FUELS FOR THE MOTORSHIPS OF THE FUTURE
AB  - Almost all of the motors in ships are two-stroke engines, the most efficient main drivers available for large ships needing long range performance. Until these engines are replaced by alternatives the focus will be on new fuels, particularly, alternative fuels to replace high sulfur fuel oil. LNG is considered the alternative fuel frontrunner. Producing almost no SOx or particulate matter emissions, LNG also boasts low NOx emissions and GHG emission reduction benefits (from fuel tank to stack) of between up to 22%, dependent on engine type. Despite these advantages, ships will not achieve zero CO2 emissions with LNG alone since it is still a fossil fuel, posing the additional challenge of CH4 slip. Another challenge with LNG has been limited bunkering infrastructure and higher CAPEX requirements. LPG is one possible alternative to LNG. Methanol and ethanol, on the other hand, present other alternatives to LNG, with similar profiles to LPG. As drop-in fuels, methanol and ethanol are easier to handle in comparison to LNG, and benefit from a well-developed global terminal network. Alternative fuels for moving towards carbon neutrality, biofuel, synthetic methane, synthetic natural gas, and biomethane, are being considered. Meanwhile, H2 and NH3 are being considered for a carbon-free future.

TI  - Evaluation of a Large Zero-Emission High-Speed Passenger Vessel
AB  - With an increasing emphasis on emission restrictions and environmental impact of carbon-based energies, transportation industries are rapidly focusing on research, development, and implementation of zero-emission fuels and technologies. In the United States, the maritime industry provides key transportation services for people and goods. Immediate and future legislation at the state and federal levels are beginning to push passenger vessel operators to seek more carbon-neutral propulsion methods and begin the necessary transition towards a zero-emission future. Small high-speed, zero-emission vessel concepts are being introduced in the United States, most notably the SWITCH project of San Francisco. The SWITCH project aims to put the first hydrogen fuel cell e-ferry into service in 2021. To date, the zero-emission fast ferry efforts have focused on smaller passenger vessels. This paper examines the potential design elements and operating conditions required for a large (450 passengers) high-speed vessel to meet zero-emission standards. Key ferry metrics of speed and passenger capacity are studied with this concept hull to compare a zero-emission propulsion system against a more traditional carbon-based system. To account for major project decision factors, the economics/cost and regulatory restrictions of a hydrogen fuel cell system are considered for a high-speed passenger vessel of this scope. A sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the technological and performance gains necessary for fuel cell power to match the current capabilities of carbon-based powers. Future development of zero-emission technologies is discussed to evaluate the continually improving opportunities for such a large high-speed vessel.

TI  - A statistical approach to ship fuel consumption monitoring
AB  - The reduction of the environmental impact imposed by Kyoto Protocol and the growth of competitiveness imposed by the shipping market have urged shipping companies to pay increasing attention to ship energy efficiency improvement and CO2 emission reduction. According to the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) recommended by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the main scope of this article is in fact to overcome the deterministic limits of the monitoring systems installed in modern ships and support technical management in decision making based on large navigation databases. The proposed statistical approach is founded on a multiple linear regression and allows for both pointwise and interval predictions of the fuel consumption. At the end of each voyage, the model can be used to alert management for a possible change in ship performance in all those situations where the actual fuel consumption lies outside the prediction interval. Moreover, the model can also be utilized to quantify the contribution to the fuel consumption due to the hull and propeller fouling, which is particularly profitable for shipping companies and operators to claim for carbon credits after a specific improvement operation.

TI  - System-level comparison of ammonia, compressed and liquid hydrogen as fuels for polymer electrolyte fuel cell powered shipping
AB  - With the aim to reduce emissions from marine transport, electric propulsion systems for a water taxi and container ship powered by a hydrogen polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell system are designed and analyzed compared to the current fuel-oil engine systems in terms of system energy and exergy efficiency, fuel consumption, mass and volume, environmental impacts and cost. Hydrogen is stored either as a compressed gas (GH2), cryogenic liquid (LH2) or produced from liquid ammonia (LNH3) and can deliver 91%,91% and 88% greenhouse gas reductions, respectively. All hydrogen sources fit within ship volume and mass constraints apart from GH2 in the cargo ship. In the absence of carbon policy measures, the costs over a 25-year system life are 108% (GH2), 112% (LH2), 116% (LNH3) greater for the container ship and 43% (GH2), 105% (LNH3) greater for the water taxi. A carbon tax of Â£75-191/tonne CO2eq would allow the low carbon options to become cost competitive. Â© 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

TI  - THE POTENTIAL OF METHANOL AS AN ALTERNATIVE MARINE FUEL FOR INDONESIAN DOMESTIC SHIPPING
AB  - This analysis aims to provide insight and to explore the future usage of methanol as an alternative marine fuel for domestic ships in Indonesia. An overview of potential application, analysis of resources availability, and stakeholder readiness on the topic are provided; related challenges are also identified and further examined. The potential performance of methanol as a fuel is discussed and evaluated via two different perspectives (the shipowner perspective and the government one) through case studies of two passenger ships owned by the shipping company Pelayaran Indonesia (PELNI): MV. Labobar and MV. Gunung Dempo. As shipowners tend to look very closely at the economic aspects, a feasibility study is performed by developing a combinatorial scenario approach based on the combination of economic measures of merit (NPV and payback period) along with a technical scenario (main-pilot fuel setup); the variables included in the calculation are: ship age, ship productivity, and macro-economy conditions. Regarding the government perspective, the main issues are environmental protection and policy compliance. These issues are evaluated by examining six emission types (NOx, SOx, CO2, CH4, N2O, and PM). Additionally, since there is a trade-off situation in government subsidies between the government and shipowner interests, an optimization and sensitivity analysis is performed by utilizing a combinatorial scenario model to determine optimum methanol price and external variables influencing the decision to support further use of methanol in the Indonesian market. An important finding was that Indonesia has certain advantages/drives to introduce methanol as a marine fuel. However, methanol competitiveness is mainly dependent on ship productivity and the price difference between methanol and marine diesel oil (MDO). Additionally, policy analysis (through an optimization approach) could be one of the government options in order to determine the optimum condition in establishing methanol as a marine fuel. Finally, short, medium, and long term recommendations are also provided as the basis for future consideration.

TI  - Research of Energy Constitution for Ocean-going Fishing Vessels towards Low Carbon

In this paper, based on the traditional diesel power plant, introducing the diesel/new energy hybrid power plant, the energy constitution for ocean-going fishing vessels is analyzed towards low-carbon. By investigating the power requirements of main propulsion, sub-engine power generation and auxiliary boiler system for the ocean-going fishing vessels during operations process, the energy consumption characteristic of it is researched. Based on this, combining the assessment reports of intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) and global warming potential (GWP), considering carbon emission of production for new energy power plant, the carbon-emissions of ocean-going fishing vessels with diesel power plant and diesel/ new energy hybrid power plant are all quantified. The necessity of new energy application in fishing vessels is verified by numerical example.

TI  - Integrated system design and control optimization of hybrid electric propulsion system using a bi-level, nested approach
AB  - Hybrid electric powertrain systems present as effective alternatives to traditional vehicle and marine propulsion means with improved fuel efficiency, as well as reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air pollutants. In this study, a new integrated, model-based design and optimization method for hybrid electric propulsion system of a marine vessel (harbor tugboat) has been introduced. The sizes of key hybrid powertrain components, especially the Li-ion battery energy storage system (ESS), which can greatly affect the shipâ€™s life-cycle cost (LCC), have been optimized using the fuel efficiency, emission and lifecycle cost model of the hybrid powertrain system. Moreover, the control strategies for the hybrid system, which is essential for achieving the minimum fuel consumption and extending battery life, are optimized. For a given powertrain architecture, the optimal design of a hybrid marine propulsion system involves two critical aspects: the optimal sizing of key powertrain components, and the optimal power control and energy management. In this work, a bi-level, nested optimization framework was proposed to address these two intricate problems jointly. The upper level optimization aims at component size optimization, while the lower level optimization carries out optimal operation control through dynamic programming (DP) to achieve the globally minimum fuel consumption and battery degradation for a given vessel load profile. The optimized Latin hypercube sampling (OLHS), Kriging and the widely used Expected Improvement (EI) online sampling criterion are used to carry out â€œsmall dataâ€ driven global optimization to solve this nested optimization problem. The obtained results showed significant reduction of the vessel LCC with the optimized hybrid electric powertrain system design and controls. Reduced engine size and operation time, as well as improved operation efficiency of the hybrid system also greatly decreased the GHG emissions compared to traditional mechanical propulsion.

TI  - Maritime Investment Appraisal: The Case of Waste Heat Recovery Systems Installation
AB  - To ensure the compliant of the CO2 regulation, the IMO set standards for the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) for ships that also led to a higher propelling costs and additional abatement investments for ship owners making energy efficiency and fuel-saving a high priority in shipping operations. This study focuses on the financial analysis of investment on waste heat recovery that has its origin in the heavy industry especially in power plants, steel mills and other high-energy fabrics. As with other industries, the waste heat recovery systems (WHRS) can also be used to reduce emissions and fuel consumption of ship engines but is still relatively new in the maritime industry and until now, the economic assessment of the installations are still not adequately covered in the scientific literature. The evaluation of the investment of the WHRS installations on ships carried out in this work used the traditional capital budgeting analysis followed by the real-option approach that includes a fuzzy model. The results were validated using data from a ferry plying between Tallinn and Helsinki. The capital budgeting analysis reveals that the investment in maritime WHR technology is economically favorable only under certain frame conditions. On the other hand, the real-option analysis shows a practical and pragmatic assessment of the WHRS investment even when implemented under high uncertainty and volatility condition in material resource markets.

TI  - Future needs for ship emission abatement and technical measures
AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has revised air pollution regulations in MARPOL Annex VI. In 2012 Emission Control Areas (ECA) will limit fuel sulphur content to 1% and from 2015 to 0.1%). NOx emissions based on ships engine speed are also reduced for new vessels (2012 &amp; 2016). Facing this legislation, ship owners have the alternative either to operate ships with costly low-sulphur fuels, or to keep using HFO but together with a gas cleaning equipment at the ship stack in order to reduce the rejected amount of SO2 gas in the atmosphere. To achieve this requirement, research and development organizations came out with proposing a solution that uses a device for cleaning exhaust gas of marine diesel engines. The paper presents a short communication about the DEECON project, which aim is to create a novel on-board after-treatment unit more advanced than any currently available. Each sub-unit of the system will be optimized to remove a specific primary pollutant. In particular, the technology within the DEECON system is based on novel or improved abatement techniques for reducing SOx, NOx, Particulate Matter (PM), CO and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC). Some of these technologies are completely new for the maritime sector and they will represent a breakthrough in the reduction of the atmospheric emissions of ships, moving forward the performance of exhaust gas cleaning systems and fostering and anticipating the adoption of future and tighter regulatory requirements. In addition, an after-treatment strategy enables the possible adoption of alternative fuels, which often have their own emissions characteristics.

TI  - Research on energy efficiency design index calculation method for the hybrid ship
AB  - The Marine Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) is recognized as an effective tool to measure the level of carbon emissions from ships at home and abroad. It will play an important role in the assessment of carbon emissions from the shipping industry, especially under the current and future development goal of carbon neutrality. Various green technologies to reduce the carbon emissions of ships have been demonstrated and applied. Hybrid power system is one of them. Compared with traditional direct propulsion, it can significantly reduce the energy consumption and carbon emissions of ships in inland waters such as the Yangtze River. Based on the characteristics of the hybrid power system, this paper firstly analyzes the power types of the hybrid power system during ship navigation. Then, according to the principle and elements of EEDI calculation method, it puts forward the key problems that should be solved in ship EEDI calculation of hybrid power system. Then, according to different hybrid operation modes, it also puts forward the calculation method of EEDI of each power mode and the calculation method of acquired EEDI of hybrid ship. Finally, the calculation and analysis of a 7500DWT hybrid bulk carrier show that the EEDI calculation method for hybrid ships proposed in this paper is scientific and reasonable.

TI  - A study on the economic impact of emission reduction in the shipping industry
AB  - Concerning the maritime transportation industry, according to the International Maritime Organization (the United Nations' regulatory body to ensure that the shipping industry contribution in emissions' reductions is managed effectively) CO2 emissions have increased by almost 70 per cent in the last 25 years. As a result of the imminent threat, the European Commission together with the organizations concerned with the decrease of the pollution level and the control of the greenhouse gas emissions decided to regulate the system through the introduction of new threshold via legislative measures. The paper highlights the results of a doctoral research concerning ship owners attitudes towards sustainable strategies designed to meet the requirements of the new regulations imposed by the International Maritime Organization. The first objective is to reveal the relevant measures undertaken by shipowners to support the decrease in greenhouse gas and non-greenhouse gas emissions. The second objective concerns to what extent these measures might economically influence the organizations performance and which are the benefits of implementing the policy mechanisms within the current economic environment.

TI  - Two-step strategies towards fuel saving and emissions reduction onboard ships
AB  - Management of energy consumption constitutes the major challenge in marine shipping industry for the next generation. It has received a large attention from both scientific researchers considering consumption, economic and environmental impact; and industrial experiments supported by marine engine manufacturing companies and other governmental and non-governmental entities. Over the years, many solutions have been put forward to overcome the effects of this problem, while maintaining the amount of goods transported globally at the same transfer rate and ship speed. The present paper sheds light on many of the methods used currently to reach this purpose. We argue that applying a certain fuel-saving strategy will rely on some factors, the most important of which is the type of ship. Mainly two methods, including shore-side power and cold out of heat strategies, have been investigated regarding adaption, economic, and environmental issues in case of applying onboard high-speed passenger ships. This concept has also been applied on a vessel operating in the Red Sea region for applicability and benefits of this approach. It was determined that the proposed two-step strategies significantly reduce the consumption of fuel onboard the ship by about 310 ton per year, and in addition, considerably reduce the amount of ship emissions, which could reach more than a thousand tons per year.

TI  - Minimizing Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships Using a Pareto Multi-Objective Optimization Approach
AB  - To confront climate change, decarbonization strategies must change the global economy. According to statements made as part of the European Green Deal, maritime transport should also become drastically less polluting. As a result, the price of transport must reflect the impact it has on the environment and on health. In such a framework, the purpose of this paper is to suggest a novel method for minimizing emissions from ships, based on so-called Pareto multi-objective optimization. For a given voyage by a ship, the problem is to minimize emissions on the one hand and minimize fuel consumption or passage time on the other. Minimizing emissions is considered as the preferred objective. Therefore, the objective of minimizing fuel consumption or passage time needs to be reformulated as a constraint. Solving such a problem consists of finding most favourable path and speed for the ship and satisfying the optimization criteria. Relatively new systems such as hybrid diesel-electric systems have the potential to offer significant emissions benefits. A hybrid power supply utilizes the maximum efficiency of the direct mechanical drive and the flexibility of a combination of combustion power from the prime mover and stored power from energy storage from an electrical supply, at part load and overload. A new report by the American Bureau of Shipping suggests that maritime transport is likely to meet the International Maritime Organization's target by 2030, solely by using current technology and operational measures. However, this would not be enough to attain the target of reducing CO2 emissions by 2050 by at least 50% compared to 2008. New technologies and operational methods must be applied.

TI  - LIFE-CYCLE COST ANALYSIS ON A MARINE ENGINE INNOVATION FOR RETROFIT: A COMPARATIVE STUDY
AB  - Stricter regulations and ambitious targets regarding air emissions from ships have led the shipping industry to a tipping point necessitating disruptive technologies for green and ecological operation. This study introduces a dual-fuel engine innovation with ultra-high energy conversion efficiency, thereby reducing exhaust gas emissions. However, the total cost performance of such an innovation throughout its long lifespan can be a matter of concern for decision makers (i.e. ship owners) if they decide to retrofit their existing fleet. The purpose of this study is to provide insights into the economic performance of such an innovative dual-fuel engine when it is utilized as the main propulsion system. From a cradle-to-grave perspective ranging from construction, operation, maintenance to end-of-life, the life-cycle costing (LCC) framework is proposed to evaluate the long-term cost performance of the dual-fuel engine with that of a conventional diesel engine. By using the net present cost (NPC) as an evaluation indicator, the research results reveal that the dual-fuel engine is considered as a cost-effective option except for the high fuel price differential scenario, meaning that fuel prices are the most critical factor for ship owners. In addition, the environmental impact of these engines is included in the evaluation to show that 33% reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) can be achieved when running the dual-fuel engine, compared to the diesel engine. The proposed framework could conceivably be beneficial in selecting marine engine innovation that takes not only the environmental impact but also the economic performance into consideration.

TI  - Vessel's trim optimization using IoT data and machine learning models
AB  - The shipping industry is an important source of greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrogen oxides. In the past few years, environmental and policy reasons dictate the immense reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in industries worldwide. Towards this direction, the shipping industry has focused on ship trim optimization in the last few years as an operational measure for better energy efficiency and thus a way to reduce consumption and energy-related emissions. In this paper, we present a machine learning solution to the problem of trim optimization. Specifically, we use Internet of Things (IoT) data for speed, draft, and trim in order to accurately predict shaft power. After our machine learning model is trained, we use its predicting capabilities to create the shaft power surface as part of the trim monitoring user interface of the maritime company infrastructure.

TI  - Modeling and performance analysis of diesel engine considering the heating effect of blow-by on cylinder intake gas
AB  - Recently, the stringent international regulations on ship energy efficiency and NOx emissions from ocean-going ships make energy conservation and emission reduction be the theme of the shipping industry. Due to its fuel economy and reliability, most large commercial vessels are propelled by a low-speed two-stroke marine diesel engine, which consumes most of the fuel in the ship. In the present work, a zero-dimensional model is developed, which considers the blow-by, exhaust gas bypass, gas exchange, turbocharger, and heat transfer. Meanwhile, the model is improved by considering the heating effect of the blow-by gas on the intake gas. The proposed model is applied to a MAN B&amp;W low-speed two-stroke marine diesel engine and validated with the engine shop test data. The simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental results. The accuracy of the model is greatly improved after considering the heating effect of blow-by gas.

TI  - A review of emissions reduction technologies for low and medium speed marine Diesel engines and their potential for waste heat recovery
AB  - Reducing emissions from internal combustion engines is becoming one of the most important tasks for engine manufactures and transport regulatory organizations. In particular, the marine transportation sector is one of the most polluting, due to the intense maritime activity and the use of low-quality fuels, burned in Heavy Duty Diesel Engines, for ship propulsion and auxiliary power generation. In order to reduce the global shipping environmental impact, the IMO (International Maritime Organization) is restricting NO and SO ships' emissions through the introduction of the IMO Tier III legislation, which requires to consider a wide spectrum of emissions reduction technologies and strategies, which are going to have an impact on the engine performance and fuel consumption. In this work, the main solutions being currently developed or adopted for low and medium speed Diesel engines have been reviewed from a qualitative, and sometimes quantitative, point of view, but, in comparison to previous literature, focusing more on their potential with respect to possible waste heat recovery systems utilization, such as, in particular, steam Rankine cycles and Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC). Indeed, even though many of the considered emissions mitigation technologies lead to a certain amount of penalty in fuel economy, the use of waste heat recovery systems to recover wasted engines energy could become interesting in order to develop more efficient but, at the same time, cleaner engines.

TI  - Simulation study on the Influence of EEDI Requirements to Shiphandling in Heavy Weather
AB  - In order to reduce the CO2 emission from ships, International Maritime Organization executes the restriction of Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) which limits amount of CO2 when freight of one ton is carried at one mile. Although the realization of higher efficiency of main engine without reduction of engine output is the best solution, it might be impossible. To comply with the EEDI requirements, it is assumed that the ship's engine power becomes smaller than the existing ship by means of improving the ship propulsive efficiency. However, shiphandling in rough seas is expected to become difficult when the engine power is reduced. In this paper it is shown that the influence of the degraded main engine exerts on the safety of shiphandling in heavy weather based on the simulation study. In these experiments, both the simulation model that decreased engine power corresponding to EEDI requirement and that with the conventional engine power were tested, and masters in active service maneuvered the test ships in the rough seas.

TI  - Fuel Saving with a Hybrid Power System for an Electric Ferry
AB  - Fuel efficiency improvements and integration of low or zero emission sources into shipboard power systems have recently become a global trend in the maritime industry. In this context, hybrid ship power system architectures with diesel-electric generators and battery energy storage systems have drawn attention as an attractive solution to increase fuel efficiency and thereby reduce emissions. In this arrangement, the battery energy storage system is used as a buffer to decouple the load dynamics and thereby allow the engine to operate at its optimal operating range. The aim of this study is to assess the fuel saving that can be achieved with this arrangement in an electric ferry. Load profile of an actual ferry, operating between two terminals, is used to estimate the fuel-saving. Results of this study showed that 4.65 L of fuel can be saved in a round-trip by avoiding low efficiency operating regions of the diesel engine. Â© 2019 IEEE.

TI  - Zero emissions wellboat powered by hydrogen fuel cells hybridised with batteries
AB  - Due to the more stringent regulations on pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions in the maritime transport sector, solutions are being sought to reduce or avoid the emissions generated during the operation of ships. The onboard installation of hydrogen-fuelled fuel cells is a solution respectful with the environment and the marine ecosystem through which ships navigate. In this work, the design of a wellboat and its power plant based on fuel cells fed with hydrogen and hybridised with batteries is conducted, making it a zero-emissions ship that can navigate Emission Control Areas (ECAs). The fuel cells used are polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), and the hydrogen they consume is stored in tanks pressurised at 35 MPa, grouping these tanks into three standard containers (Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units) installed on an exposed deck. The electrical and propulsion needs of the ship are covered by the installed power plant, providing an average power of 1266 kW and a peak power of 2624 kW, making it possible to avoid the emission of 10.8 t of CO2, 195 kg of NOx and 9 kg of SOx per 14 h mission.

TI  - Emissions tradeoffs among alternative marine fuels: Total fuel cycle analysis of residual oil, marine gas oil, and marine diesel oil
AB  - Worldwide concerns about sulfur oxide (SOx) emissions from ships are motivating the replacement of marine residual oil (RO) with cleaner, lower-sulfur fuels, such as marine gas oil (MGO) and marine diesel oil (MDO). Vessel operators can use MGO and MDO directly or blended with RO to achieve environmental and economic objectives. Although expected to be much cleaner in terms of criteria pollutants, these fuels require additional energy in the upstream stages of the fuel cycle (i.e., fuel processing and refining), and thus raise questions about the net impacts on greenhouse gas emissions (primarily carbon dioxide {[}CO2]) because of production and use. This paper applies the Total Energy and Environmental Analysis for Marine Systems (TEAMS) model to conduct a total fuel cycle analysis of RO, MGO, MDO, and associated blends for a typical container ship. MGO and MDO blends achieve significant (70-85\%) SOx emissions reductions compared with RO across a range of fuel quality and refining efficiency assumptions. We estimate CO2 increases of less than 1\% using best estimates of fuel quality and refinery efficiency parameters and demonstrate how these results vary based on parameter assumptions. Our analysis suggests that product refining efficiency influences the CO2 tradeoff more than differences in the physical and energy parameters of the alternative fuels, suggesting that modest increases in CO2 could be offset by efficiency improvements at some refineries. Our results help resolve conflicting estimates of greenhouse gas tradeoffs associated with fuel switching and other emissions control policies.

TI  - Length and hull shape importance to reach IMO's GHG target SMC-075-2019
AB  - In April 2018 at the 72nd session of IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee, a GHG strategy consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goals was adopted. The main target set was to reduce absolute GHG emissions from shipping in 2050 by 50% compared to 2008. To reduce GHG emissions there are five main technical and operational measures: hull design; power and propulsion; alternative fuels; alternative energy sources; and operations. In this paper we focus on the potential reductions through hull design, i.e. length and hull shapes in relation to speed and sea states. Our findings indicate that moderate increases of length and reduction of block to enable better hull shapes give 10 - 20 % reduction of annual fuel consumption and hence emissions for a low or even negative abatement cost. Achieving these reductions will require that national and international authorities stop penalizing energy efficient ships with increased length compared to standard tonnage through higher port and fairway fees; pilotage rules; and artificial sailing restrictions.

TI  - Evaluation of Alternative Fuels for Coastal Ferries
AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and European Union (EU) have set targets to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Focusing on ships above 5000 GT, their measures exclude several ship types, such as fishing vessels, offshore ships, and yachts. However, smaller ships generate 15-20\% of the total GHG emissions. Multiple potential fuel alternatives are already in use or have been investigated to minimize carbon emissions for coastal ferries. This study evaluates the possibility of using alternative fuels for small ferries by seven different parameters: technical readiness, presence of regulations, GHG emission reduction effectiveness (with two different criteria), capital expenditure (Capex), operating expenditure (Opex), and ice navigation ability. The assessment is based on an evaluation of state-of-the-art literature as well as second-hand statistics and press releases. The study also reports the most recent implementations in each alternative technology area. As a result, it was found that although there are several measures with high potential for the future, the most feasible fuel alternatives for coastal ferries would be fully electric or diesel-electric hybrid solutions.

TI  - Design of hybrid diesel-electric energy storage systems to maximize overall ship propulsive efficiency
AB  - The concept of hybrid cars, where a combination of prime mover and energy storage allows a more efficient use of fuel shows considerable promise. Our work considers the same concept for ship propulsion using a storage medium in order to reduce the transient loads of the main engine (e.g. operation in rough sea, manoeuvre or speed variations) and applying a load levelling technique. Emissions that are produced in transient cases are higher and the developed reduction techniques deal mainly with the optimum operational point. This work, using real operational data of Post Panamax vessels, correlates daily sea state and engine loading to propose and size alternative hybrid propulsion system to reduce emissions and fuel consumption. The latter are calculated using the "as measured" fuel consumption; the bunker characteristics and widely adopted empirical formulae. Finally, the design issues of how hybrid technology would potentially affect modern ship design are examined along with the economic feasibility of the proposed scenarios. Â© 2010 COPPE/UFRJ.

TI  - The Method to Decrease Emissions from Ships in Port Areas
AB  - Nowadays great attention is being paid to the ecological aspects of maritime transport functioning, including the problem of pollution and emission of poisonous substances from ships. Such emissions have a significant impact on the environment and sustainable operation of ports, especially those located close to intensive waterways. A decrease in emissions from ships may be achieved by implementing different methods, among others, through the use of environmentally friendly fuels, electrical and hybrid vehicles, as well as through the improvement of port approach and inside navigational channels, optimization of the transport processes organization, etc. However, the size of the influence of ships' crew and ports pilots' qualification on the possibility to decrease the emissions from ships during maneuvering in port areas remains a question. This article aims to develop a method to assess the possible decrease of the emissions from ships in ports, considering human factor influence. The method has been developed and verified on the selected case study example. The influence of ships' crew and ports pilots' qualification on time spent on maneuvering operations by ships in port areas and consequently the volume of emissions has been investigated. The research results show that for the set conditions it is possible to reduce emissions from ships up to 12.5\%. For that reason, appropriate education and training are needed to improve the qualifications of decision-makers performing ship maneuvers at ports areas.

TI  - Analysis of the Impact of Split Injection on Fuel Consumption and NOx Emissions of Marine Medium-Speed Diesel Engine
AB  - The medium-speed diesel engine in diesel-electric propulsion systems is increasingly used as the propulsion engine for liquefied natural gas (LNG) ships and passenger ships. The main advantage of such systems is high reliability, better maneuverability, greater ability to optimize and significant decreasing of the engine room volume. Marine propulsion systems are required to be as energy efficient as possible and to meet environmental protection standards. This paper analyzes the impact of split injection on fuel consumption and NOx emissions of marine medium-speed diesel engines. For the needs of the research, a zero-dimensional, two-zone numerical model of a diesel engine was developed. Model based on the extended Zeldovich mechanism was applied to predict NOx emissions. The validation of the numerical model was performed by comparing operating parameters of the basic engine with data from engine manufacturers and data from sea trials of a ship with diesel-electric propulsion. The applicability of the numerical model was confirmed by comparing the obtained values for pressure, temperature and fuel consumption. The operation of the engine that drives synchronous generator was simulated under stationary conditions for three operating points and nine injection schemes. The values obtained for fuel consumption and NOx emissions for different fuel injection schemes indicate the possibility of a significant reduction in NOx emissions but with a reduction in efficiency. The results showed that split injection with a smaller amount of pilot fuel injected and a smaller angle between the two injection allow a moderate reduction in NOx emissions without a significant reduction in efficiency. The application of split injection schemes that allow significant reductions in NOx emissions lead to a reduction in engine efficiency.

TI  - Optimization using viscous flow computations for retrofitting ships in operation
AB  - Shipping is commonly believed to be the most energy efficient mode of transport. Nonetheless, the shipping industry is required to reduce its environmental impact. The IMO has developed a package of measures for reducing shipping's CO2 emissions within an agreed timetable for adoption (Energy Efficiency Design Index for the design of new ships and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan for the operational phase). Approximately three-quarters of the vessels are rather young, so most ships in operation need solutions to reduce their pollution. In general, the suitable solutions differ from ship newbuilding, in which hull form optimization and newest machinery technology can be readily employed. This paper will demonstrate how simulation-driven design using the CAE platform FRIENDSHIP-Framework, coupled to the viscous flow CFD solver SHIPFLOW, can be used to efficiently develop optimized solutions for the retrofitting of ships in operation. Systematic variation as well as formal optimization is used in the process, coupling automated generation of geometry variants to simulation. The retrofitting solutions that will be covered are measures to decrease the resistance or increase the propulsive efficiency of the ship. Typical examples are energy-saving devices that are added to the ship or replacing parts of the hull or the appendages with new, optimized shapes. The validity of the concept will be demonstrated with the results from case studies that include a motor yacht, as well as a commercial RoPax ship.

TI  - Preparations required for switching to ultra low sulfur diesel in marine propulsion and onboard auxiliary engines
AB  - Arctic Ocean environments are quite delicate, and shipping in Arctic regions has been very limited. Although ships are the most efficient means of cargo transport from an air quality perspective, they are never the less considered large point sources of CO2 and GHG emissions. Recognizing this, local far north Alaskan air quality requirements have called for the use of Ultra Low Sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuels to lessen SOx emissions from engine driven main propulsion systems and other onboard auxiliary machinery. ULSD (limited to 15 ppm or 0.0015% sulfur) exceeds all current requirements for marine diesel fuels to be burned in the proposed Emissions Control Areas worldwide. There is a price to pay for burning ULSD, as the physical properties of the diesel fuel are changed during the sulfur removal process. In addition, end-product fuel analysis varies depending upon the sulfur content in the feed stock, and the oil refinery used to produce ULSD. Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel is known to have caused engine and component malfunctions due to decreased lubricity, viscosity, and other compositional incompatibilities. This paper (referencing a recently completed project) will highlight the methodology used to prepare a ship for the switch from Marine Gas Oil to ULSD. Copyright 2011, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Technology Choice under Emission Regulation Uncertainty in International Container Shipping
AB  - We present a real options approach to evaluate technology and capacity choices under regulatory uncertainty. Our two-phase, regime-switching model includes the option of investing in different technologies as well as a charter and layup option, respectively. For a base-case version of this model, we derive an analytical solution before studying the effect of regulatory uncertainty in a numerical extension that relaxes certain restrictive assumptions. We then describe three regulatory regimes, an emissions cap, an emissions tax and a cap-and-trade market, and compare how effectively each reduces emissions. Applying the model to maritime container shipping, we develop insights on the optimal technology choice for reducing SOx emissions. We find that regulatory uncertainty can increase not only project values but also owned capacity. From a regulatory perspective, an emissions cap reduces emissions more effectively whereas an emissions tax reduces the cost of regulation. The cap-and-trade market emerges in many respects as superior to an emissions tax. Finally, we show that setting the emissions cap level-or deciding on the level above which an emissions tax or emissions trade apply-is critical because reduction in total industry emissions are not necessarily continuous.

TI  - The influence of different types of marine fuel over the energy efficiency operational index
AB  - One of the main concerns of our society is certainly environmental protection. The international efforts for maintaining a clean environment are various and this paper refers to the efforts in the maritime transport field. The subject of our study is the concept of Energy Efficiency Operational Index (EEOI), developed to provide ship-owners with assistance in the process of establishing the emissions from ships in operation, and to suggest the methods for achieving their reduction. As a monitoring tool, EEOI represents the mass of CO2 emitted per unit of transport work. Using the software developed by the authors, it will emphasize the variation of the EEOI value for one vessel using different types of fuel during the laden and ballast voyages, for a period of three months, as stated in the Ship's Log Books. The main consumers considered are Main Engine, Diesel Generators and steam Boilers, and the types of fuel used will be as per charter party agreements and following the specific international and local rules and regulations. The results for the quality parameter EEOI and the average cost of achieving them will be included in compared cost-to-quality graphs, in order to underline the profitability of the studied methods for minimizing the air emissions.

TI  - Bunker levy schemes for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction in international shipping
AB  - A fuel levy is one of the market-based measures (MBMs) currently under consideration at the International Maritime Organization. MBMs have been proposed to improve the energy efficiency of the shipping sector and reduce its emissions. This paper analyses the economic and environmental implications of two types of levy on shipping bunker fuels by means of an analytical model built on the cobweb theorem. A unit-tax per ton of fuel and an ad-valorem tax, enforced as a percentage of fuel prices, are examined. In both cases, a speed and fuel-consumption reduction equivalent to an improvement in the energy efficiency of the sector would be expected as a result of the regulation enforcement. The speed reduction in the unit-tax case depends on fuel prices and the tax amount, whereas in the ad-valorem case it relies upon the enforced tax percentage. Both schemes lead to industry profit decline, the extent of which depend on the structure of the levy and market conditions. Since there is concern that the costs resulting from the policy will be passed from shipping companies to their customers along the supply chain, the paper dwells on how the costs arising from the enforcement of the levy will be actually allocated between ship-owners and operators, and cargo-owners. In a market characterised by high freight rates and with no or limited excess capacity, a higher percentage of the total tax amount is transferred from ship-owners to shippers. In case of a recession the opposite happens. Â© 2017 The Authors

TI  - Virtual arrival: A real option for energy saving?
AB  - The maritime traffic is the real backbone of the international transport of goods in the world and it is driven by a severe observance of time scheduling. Nevertheless, mainly in relation with the most traveled routes, frequently it might happen that port facilities are congested, and the time schedule for ship load/unload operations is accordingly delayed. In this circumstance the choice is between meeting the original ETA (estimated time of arrival) and then let the ship riding at anchor or slowing down the ship in order to adjust the arrival to the actually needed time window. The latter option is called "Virtual Arrival"[l] because it consists of applying a speed reduction that fits the new time for port operations instead of arriving at the original ETA. The purpose of this paper is to investigate to what extent the Virtual Arrival policy could be a valuable option providing a reasonable energy saving for ships. The potential benefits are considerable and they result in direct saving in fuel consumption, reduction of C02 emissions and less congested port areas.

TI  - Review of 2010: The past is black, but the future is green
AB  - Year 2010 is, in many ways, a year that will be better forgotten. It started in the depths of a global recession, and although there has been much cause for optimism, little of that has yet to reach the shipping and shipbuilding industries in tangible form. Year 2010 may also be remembered as the year in which ship efficiency and alternative fuels began to be taken seriously. The need for efficiency has to be met by more complex, cleaner, hull forms as well as more sophisticated machinery and systems. The year ended with DNV trumpeting its environmentally-friendly VLCC design concept, Traility. In 2010, The Motorship investigated the feasibility of holding a conference about gas fueled ships in 2010. At the time, and certainly in the view of experts just 12 mo back, the idea of large ocean-going merchant ships using LNG as fuel was seen as a pipe dream. Meanwhile, a consortium of British, American, and Greek interests agreed in November 20101 to investigate the practical maritime applications for small modular reactors, in particular for commercial tanker vessels. The Strategic Research Group at Lloyds Register Hyperion Power Generation, UK designer BMT Nigel Gee and Greek ship operator Enterprises Shipping and Trading are leading a research program into nuclear propulsion, which is technically feasible and has the potential to drastically reduce the CO2 emissions from commercial shipping. The project expects to result in a concept tanker-ship design in which special attention will be paid to analysis of lifecycle cost as well as hull-form designs and structural layout, including grounding and collision protection. In addition, its latest NYK Altair container ship recently made her maiden voyage, calling at Hamburg. The NYK Super Eco Ship 2030 concept claims to reduce CO2 emissions by up to 69% against current levels, using such measures as a lightweight hull with an air-lubrication system, while the extensive use of renewable energy sources and LNG-based fuel cells will further lower the carbon footprint.

TI  - The future of LNG as a ship fuel
AB  - Stricter environmental legislation for Emission Control Areas (ECAs) prompted a shift towards alternative fuels in the shipping industry over the past year. This development will continue in 2020, with the introduction of the 0.5% sulphur regulations in European waters and the worldwide sulphur cap expected to enter into force by 2025 at the latest. The results from the Paris meeting on climate change in late 2015 may also result in a greater focus on C02 emissions from shipping. By 2030 the maritime industry could therefore also face restrictions on C02 emissions. With the technology available and the regulatory framework in place, liquefied natural gas (LNG) is the most promising alternative fuel option. Currently, there are 75 LNG fuelled ships in operation worldwide (not including the LNG carriers), with another 84 confirmed newbuildings on order. While most of the current projects are relatively small vessels, LNG has also become an option for ultra large container vessels and bulk carriers. The main markets for LNG technology have moved from Norway to North American waters, the North and the Baltic Sea. However, oil based fuels are still superior regarding energy density, handling, availability and costs. The presentation takes a look at challenges associated with conventional fuels and the possibility of using alternatives like LNG or methanol. The OPEX and CAPEX aspects of the technology, fuel availability and fuel pricing are discussed. To illustrate the potential of LNG technology a look at the "PERFECt ship project" is given.

TI  - DATA DRIVEN DIGITAL TWIN APPLICATIONS TOWARDS GREEN SHIP OPERATIONS
AB  - Due to the growing rate of energy consumption and its consequent emissions, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has devised strict rules for an extensive reduction in Greenhouse Emissions (GHG), which forces the shipping industry to search for more energy-efficient solutions. Therefore, alongside with the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), improving the energy efficiency of existing ships under the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) is of considerable importance. This paper address this issue by proposing a digital twin framework supported by big data analytics for ship performance monitoring. The proposed framework is developed by the respective data sets from a selected vessel. For this purpose, a cluster analysis is implemented using the Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. By this approach, the most frequent operating regions of the engine is detected, the shapes of these frequent operating regions are captured, and the relationships between different navigation and performance parameters of the engine are determined. That will make the basis for a digital twin application in shipping. The main objective of this research study is to develop a digital twin of a marine engine by considering the engine operational conditions that can be utilized toward green ship operations. The contribution of this paper and the outcomes can facilitate the shipping industry to meet the IMO requirements enforced by its regulations. Copyright Â© 2022 by ASME.

TI  - Establishment of EEDI Baseline for Inland Ship of Bangladesh
AB  - Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) {[}1] was introduced by the International Maritime organization (IMO) to stimulate innovation and technical development of all elements that increase the level of energy efficiency of a ship at design stage. Sea going ships over 400 gross tonnage are considered in the current regulation of EEDI. Inland ships are not covered by current EEDI regulations by IMO. As inland vessels share 0.6\% of the global CO2 emission {[}2], the reduction attempt will not have bigger impact. But from the commercial point of view of a country the significance is very high, specially for under developed countries like Bangladesh. Inland self propelled ships face additional restrictions (shallow water/channel, low density water, restriction of ship's dimension, etc.) which increase the power requirement at the same speed, burning more fuel and emit more CO2. This paper is a continuation of the Ph.D research of the author where previous published paper's [}3] results were updated and verified. The result of this paper would be one of the 1st attempts in the world was made to establish EEDI baseline for different types of self-propelled inland ships. (C) 2017 The Authors.
