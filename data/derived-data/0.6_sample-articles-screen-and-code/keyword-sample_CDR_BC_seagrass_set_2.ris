TI  - Very high-resolution seismo-acoustic imaging of seagrass meadows (Mediterranean Sea): Implications for carbon sink estimates
AB  - Posidonia oceanica is a widespread coastal Mediterranean seagrass which accumulates in its subsurface large quantities of organic material derived from its roots, rhizomes and leaf sheaths embedded in sandy sediments. These organic deposits may be up to several meters thick as they accumulate over thousands of years forming the matte, whose high content in organic carbon plays a major role in the global ocean carbon cycle. In this study, very high-resolution seismo-acoustic methods were applied to image the subsurface features of a P. oceanica seagrass meadow at Portlligat (CadaquÃ©s, Girona, Spain), in the NW-Mediterranean Sea. Our findings yield fresh insights into the settling of the P. oceanica meadow in the study area, and define with unprecedented detail the potential volume occupied by the matte. A strong reflector, located from 4.3 to 11.7 m depth, was recognized in several seismo-acoustic profiles as the substratum on which P. oceanica first settled in the study area. A 3D bathymetric model of this substratum allowed us to reconstruct the Portlligat palaeo-environment prior to the settling of P. oceanica, which corresponded to a shallow coastal setting protected from the open sea. A core drilled in the meadow at Portlligat revealed the presence of a 6 in thick dense matte composed of medium to coarse, sandy sediments mixed with plant debris and bioclasts. Radiocarbon datings revealed a constant accretion rate of the matte of about 1.1 m/kyr. Gravelly bioclastic deposits observed at the base of the core correspond to the base of the matte and gave a date of 5616 Â± 46 Cal yr BP. For the first time, very high-resolution marine geophysical techniques allowed us to accurately define the volume occupied by P. oceanica matte, which in the study area reaches up to almost 220,000 Â± 17,400 M3. This result is an important step forward in our efforts to estimate the size of the carbon sink represented by P. oceanica meadows along the Mediterranean coasts significantly contributing to the biosphere carbon cycle.

TI  - Mangroves as a major source of soil carbon storage in adjacent seagrass meadows
AB  - Mangrove forests have the potential to export carbon to adjacent ecosystems but whether mangrovederived organic carbon (OC) would enhance the soil OC storage in seagrass meadows adjacent to mangroves is unclear. In this study we examine the potential for the contribution of mangrove OC to seagrass soils on the coast of North Sulawesi, Indonesia. We found that seagrass meadows adjacent to mangroves had significantly higher soil OC concentrations, soil OC with lower delta C-13, and lower bulk density than those at the non-mangrove adjacent meadows. Soil OC storage to 30 cm depth ranged from 3.21 to 6.82 kg C m(-2), and was also significantly higher at the mangrove adjacent meadows than those non-adjacent meadows. delta C-13 analyses revealed that mangrove OC contributed 34 to 83\% to soil OC at the mangrove adjacent meadows. The delta C-13 value of seagrass plants was also different between the seagrasses adjacent to mangroves and those which were not, with lower values measured at the seagrasses adjacent to mangroves. Moreover, we found significant spatial variation in both soil OC concentration and storage, with values decreasing toward sea, and the contribution of mangrovederived carbon also reduced with distance from the forest.

TI  - THE POSIDONIA OCEANICA MATTE: A UNIQUE COASTAL CARBON SINK FOR CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT
AB  - Seagrass meadows have long been recognized for their high ecological and economic value (ecosystem services). More recently, a potential role in climate regulation, due to their ability to fix and sequester carbon, has been the focus of intensive study. In the Mediterranean Sea, the matte, a specific structure built by the seagrass Posidonia oceanica, is of particular interest because it keeps buried for thousands of years massive amounts of carbon. Recent studies carried out along the Corsican coasts show a mean fixation of 1.62 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), with a sequestration rate of between 27 and 30 \%, a mean matte thickness of 210 cm and 711 Mg C ha(-1) of organic carbon trapped in the matte. That is to say, a stock corresponding to 1,580 years of P. oceanica carbon sequestration, confirmed by radiocarbon analysis. An extrapolation to the Mediterranean basin (1.0 to 1.5 million hectares covered by P. oceanica meadow; mean matte thickness: 210 cm) shows that the total stock of organic carbon sequestered in the P. oceanica matte might be as much as 711 to 1,067 million Mg C. The conservation of the P. oceanica meadows thus constitutes an issue of major importance since any degradation of the matte, which has been built up over the past millennia, would very likely result in the release of considerable quantities of carbon. Rather than playing a major role in the attenuation of the impact of climate change (blue carbon sequestration), the P. oceanica meadow would then become a source of carbon that would be likely to amplify the greenhouse gas emissions. Management of P. oceanica meadows should take into account not only their role in carbon sequestration, but also the whole the full range of their ecosystem services, in relation with the functioning of the ecosystem.

TI  - Loss of surficial sedimentary carbon stocks in seagrass meadows subjected to intensive clam harvesting
AB  - Seagrass carbon stocks are vulnerable to physical disturbance. We assessed the effect of clam harvesting on the organic carbon (Corg) stocks in surface sediments in four intertidal Zostera noltei meadows on the Iberian Atlantic coast (Spain and Portugal), by comparing undisturbed and harvested areas. We also monitored the spatial cover of the meadows throughout the growing season. Sedimentary Corg content and Corg stocks were about four times lower in intensively harvested areas than in control areas, but there were not differences between areas with low harvesting pressure and control areas. Reductions of 53-85\% in sedimentary Corg stocks of Z. noltei meadows were caused by intensive clam harvesting. The effect of intensive clam harvesting on Corg stocks increased throughout the growing season, but the area covered by the seagrass increased from 21 to 37\%, suggesting rapid recovery of seagrass canopies and potential recovery of sedimentary Corg stocks.

TI  - Sugars dominate the seagrass rhizosphere
AB  - Seagrasses are among the most efficient sinks of carbon dioxide on Earth. While carbon sequestration in terrestrial plants is linked to the microorganisms living in their soils, the interactions of seagrasses with their rhizospheres are poorly understood. Here, we show that the seagrass, Posidonia oceanica excretes sugars, mainly sucrose, into its rhizosphere. These sugars accumulate to mu M concentrations-nearly 80 times higher than previously observed in marine environments. This finding is unexpected as sugars are readily consumed by microorganisms. Our experiments indicated that under low oxygen conditions, phenolic compounds from P. oceanica inhibited microbial consumption of sucrose. Analyses of the rhizosphere community revealed that many microbes had the genes for degrading sucrose but these were only expressed by a few taxa that also expressed genes for degrading phenolics. Given that we observed high sucrose concentrations underneath three other species of marine plants, we predict that the presence of plant-produced phenolics under low oxygen conditions allows the accumulation of labile molecules across aquatic rhizospheres. Seagrass meadows are important carbon sinks. Here, the authors show that organic carbon in the form of simple sugars can accumulate at high concentrations in seagrass rhizospheres because plant phenolic compounds inhibit their consumption by microorganisms.

TI  - Carbon economy of Mediterranean seagrasses in response to thermal stress
AB  - Increased plant mortality in temperate seagrass populations has been recently observed after summer heatwaves, although the underlying causes of plant death are yet unknown. The potential energetic constrains resulting from anomalous thermal events could be the reason that triggered seagrass mortality, as demonstrated for benthic invertebrates. To test this hypothesis, the carbon balance of Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa plants from contrasting thermal environments was investigated during a simulated heatwave, by analyzing their photosynthetic performance, carbon balance (ratio photosynthesis:respiration), carbohydrates content, growth and mortality. Both species were able to overcome and recover from the thermal stress produced by the six-week exposure to temperatures 4 Â°C above mean summer levels, albeit plants from cold waters were more sensitive to warming than plants from warm waters as reflected by their inability to maintain their P:R ratio unaltered. The strategies through which plants tend to preserve their energetic status varied depending on the biology of the species and the thermal origin of plants. These included respiratory homeostasis (P. oceanica warm-plants), carbon diversion from growth to respiration (C. nodosa cold-plants) or storage (P. oceanica warm-plants) and changes in biomass allocation (C. nodosa warm-plants). Findings suggest an important geographic heterogeneity in the overall response of Mediterranean seagrasses to warming with potential negative impacts on the functions and services offered by seagrass meadows including among others their capacity for carbon sequestration and carbon export to adjacent ecosystems.

TI  - Long-term decomposition captures key steps in microbial breakdown of seagrass litter
AB  - Seagrass biomass represents an important source of organic carbon that can contribute to long-term sediment carbon stocks in coastal ecosystems. There is little empirical data on the long-term microbial decomposition of seagrass detritus, despite this process being one of the key drivers of carbon-cycling in coastal ecosystems, that is, it influences the amount and quality of carbon available for sequestration. Here, our goal was to investigate how litter quality (leaf vs. rhizome/root) and the microbial communities involved in organic matter remineralisation shift over a 2-year field decomposition study north of Sydney, Australia using the temperate seagrass Zostera muelleri. The sites varied in bulk sediment characteristics and the sediment-associated microbial communities, but these variables overall had little influence on long-term seagrass decomposition rates or seagrass-associated microbiomes. The results showed a clear succession of bacterial and archaeal communities for both tissues types from r-strategists such as Î±- and Î³-proteobacteria to K-strategies, including Î´-proteobacteria, Bacteroidia and Spirochaetes. We used a new mathematical model to capture how decay rates varied over time and found that two decomposition events occurred for some seagrass leaf samples, possibly due to exudate input from living seagrass roots growing into the litter bag. The new model also indicated that conventional single exponential models overestimate long-term decay rates, and we detected for the first time the refractory, or stable, phase of decomposition for rhizome/root biomass. The stable phase began at approximately 20% mass remaining and after 600 days, and the persistence of rhizome/root biomass was attributed to the anoxic conditions and the preservation of refractory organic matter. While we predict that rhizome/root biomass will contribute more to the long-term sediment carbon stocks, the preservation of leaf carbon may be enhanced at locations were sedimentation is high and burial in anoxic conditions is rapid and constant.

TI  - Carbon storage in the seagrass meadows of Gazi Bay, Kenya
AB  - Vegetated marine habitats are globally important carbon sinks, making a significant contribution towards mitigating climate change, and they provide a wide range of other ecosystem services. However, large gaps in knowledge remain, particularly for seagrass meadows in Africa. The present study estimated biomass and sediment organic carbon (Corg) stocks of four dominant seagrass species in Gazi Bay, Kenya. It compared sediment Corg between seagrass areas in vegetated and un-vegetated 'controls', using the naturally patchy occurence of seagrass at this site to test the impacts of seagrass growth on sediment Corg It also explored relationships between the sediment and above-ground Corg as well as between the total biomass and above-ground parameters. Sediment Corg was significantly different between species, range: 160.7-233.8 Mg C ha-1 (compared to the global range of 115.3 to 829.2 Mg C ha-1). Vegetated areas in all species had significantly higher sediment Corg compared with un-vegetated controls; the presence of seagrass increased Corg by 4-6 times. Biomass carbon differed significantly between species with means ranging between 4.8-7.1 Mg C ha-1 compared to the global range of 2.5-7.3 Mg C ha-1. To our knowledge, these are among the first results on seagrass sediment Corg to be reported from African seagrass beds; and contribute towards our understanding of the role of seagrass in global carbon dynamics.

TI  - Carbon storage in seagrass ecosystems along the Andaman coast of Thailand
AB  - Seagrass ecosystems are important contributors to mitigation of climate change, since they are responsible for large carbon sinks. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the importance of variability of carbon storage in various ecosystems. In this study, we estimated carbon storage in several structurally different seagrass meadows along the west coast of Thailand and determined whether degree of exposure, human disturbance, and meadow type influenced carbon storage within these meadows. Carbon content within the living vegetation was on average 3 +/- 2.7 Mg ha(-1), whilst average storage of carbon in the sediment was 122 +/- 35.3 Mg ha(-1). Meadow type and disturbance had a significant influence on total carbon storage in the ecosystem, while the degree of exposure of the bay did not show great differences. Uniform meadows had a higher average total carbon storage than mixed meadows (133 +/- 36.2 and 110 +/- 41.3 Mg ha(-1), respectively). Undisturbed meadows had a higher average total carbon storage than disturbed ones (140 +/- 36.5 and 103 +/- 34.8 Mg ha(-1), respectively). The results obtained contribute to our understanding of carbon storage on an ecosystem scale and can provide a baseline for proper management, conservation, and climate change studies in the region.

TI  - Seagrass cholorophyll-a, biomass and carbon algorithms based on the field and sentinel-2a satellite data at Karimunjawa Island, Indonesia
AB  - Chlorophyll-a in seagrass biomass is functioned for the photosynthetic process and store the organic carbon in their biomass of the leaf, rhizome, and root. Ecologically has functioned as blue carbon in reducing global warming adaptation and mitigation strategy. The study aimed to explore seagrass species, chlorophyll-a content, biomass and carbon stock at Karimunjawa Island. Develop algorithms of the Sentinel-2A satellite data based on field seagrass chlorophyll-a, biomass and carbon and at Pokemon and Bobby beach Karimunjawa Island. Four species of seagrass found at Bobby and Pokemon beach are Holodule pinifolia with a density of 160.44 ind.m-2, Enhalus acoroides with 26.22 ind.m-2, Halophila ovalis with 6.67 ind.m-2 and Thalassia hemprichii with 4.44 ind.m-2. The lowest seagrass chlorophyll-a is 5.854 mg.ml-1 found in H. pinifolia and the highest is 20.819 mg.ml-1 found in E. acoroides at Pokemon beach. The range of seagrass chlorophyll-a at Bobby beach was 3.485 - 14.133 mg.ml-1 in T. hemprichii. The smallest individual biomass dry weight was found in T.hempirichii with 1.32 g.dry.weight per individu, and the biggest in E.acoroides with 6.98 g.dry.weight per individu. The highest seagrass biomass at Pokemon beach was in E. acoroides with 236.93 g.m-2 which has a wide leaf morphology and the lowest in H. pinifolia with 75.91 g.m-2 with the smallest leaf morphology. The range of seagrass biomass at Bobby beach is 97.62 - 264.48 g.m-2 which is dominated by T.hempirichii. The range of seagrass carbon was 109.63 - 136.82 gC.m-2 at Pokemon beach, and in the range of 95.00 - 114.01 gC.m-2 at Bobby beach. Algorithm of seagrass chlorophyll-a = -36.308 (B3/B4)2 - 140.41(B3/B4) + 83.912; biomass = -7028.3 (B3/B4)2 + 14948 (B3/B4) - 7764.4; carbon = -17.529(B2/B3)2 + 143.82(B2/B3) - 5.3362 for Pokemon beach. Algorithm of chlorophyll-a = 455.02 (B2/B4)2 + 823.72 (B2/B4) + 375.48; biomass = -14699 (B3/B2)2 + 28395(B3/B2) - 13537; and carbon = - 0.001(B3/B4)2 + 0.209(B3/B4) - 10.203 for Bobby beach. The use of Band-2 (0.490 Âµm), Band-3 (0.560 Âµm) and Band-4 (0.665 Âµm) Sentinel-2A satellite data in the development of seagras chlorophyll-a, biomass and carbon algorithm was found to be significant.

TI  - Carbon stock and delta C-13 data of sediment samples collected from a tropical seagrass meadow in Malaysia
AB  - Seagrass ecosystems are considered as major blue carbon sinks, thus contributing directly to the mitigation of climate change by storing carbon in their habitats. However, empirical data for carbon stocks in Malaysia seagrass meadow sediment remain unreported in a standardised format. This paper presents data on organic (OC) and inorganic carbon (IC) stocks, and stable isotope signatures of carbon (delta C-13) in bulk seagrass sediments collected from Sungai Pulai estuary (Johor, Malaysia). Within this estuary, seagrasses form shoals at Tanjung Adang and Merambong. Organic carbon and delta C-13 values in bulk sediment were analysed by an elemental analyser and a continuous flow isotope-ratio mass spectrometer, respectively, while sediment IC data was derived from loss-on-ignition calculations of sample mass differences. The data from these samples are presented as downcore profile of OC (values range at 0.14\% to 2.49\%), IC (0.16\% to 5.29\%), delta C-13 values of organic matter (-27.9\% to -20.4\%), and cumulative carbon stocks (1.03-3.39 kg OC m(-2) and 0.76-2.84 kg IC m(-2)) in the top 30 cm of sediments. This dataset is applicable for regional and local blue carbon studies, which would allow insights into carbon sink and carbon cycling capacity, in addition to gaining insights into the provenances of carbon stored in seagrass meadows.

TI  - Seagrass-driven changes in carbonate chemistry enhance oyster shell growth
AB  - Quantifying the strength of non-trophic interactions exerted by foundation species is critical to understanding how natural communities respond to environmental stress. In the case of ocean acidification (OA), submerged marine macrophytes, such as seagrasses, may create local areas of elevated pH due to their capacity to sequester dissolved inorganic carbon through photosynthesis. However, although seagrasses may increase seawater pH during the day, they can also decrease pH at night due to respiration. Therefore, it remains unclear how consequences of such diel fluctuations may unfold for organisms vulnerable to OA. We established mesocosms containing different levels of seagrass biomass (Zostera marina) to create a gradient of carbonate chemistry conditions and explored consequences for growth of juvenile and adult oysters (Crassostrea gigas), a non-native species widely used in aquaculture that can co-occur, and is often grown, in proximity to seagrass beds. In particular, we investigated whether increased diel fluctuations in pH due to seagrass metabolism affected oyster growth. Seagrasses increased daytime pH up to 0.4 units but had little effect on nighttime pH (reductions less than 0.02 units). Thus, both the average pH and the amplitude of diel pH fluctuations increased with greater seagrass biomass. The highest seagrass biomass increased oyster shell growth rate (mmÂ dayâˆ’1) up to 40%. Oyster somatic tissue weight and oyster condition index exhibited a different pattern, peaking at intermediate levels of seagrass biomass. This work demonstrates the ability of seagrasses to facilitate oyster calcification and illustrates how non-trophic metabolic interactions can modulate effects of environmental change.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF ACIDIFICATION ON GROWTH AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS RATE OF SEAGRASS Thalassia hemprichii ( Ehrenberg.) Ascherson
AB  - Seagrass is a water plant that has flowers and ability to adapt to live and grow in the sea like a terrestrial plant. The survival of seagrass is greatly influenced by physical and chemical parameters of waters, such as pH, temperature, and salinity. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report by the end of 21st century, CO2 in the atmosphere has doubled along with the industrial development. The increase in CO2 in the atmosphere causes ocean acidification, it can change the chemical structure and decrease the pH of sea water. The low pH of sea water influences plant phisiology such as the inhibition of photosynthesis and growth. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of pH on the growth and photosynthesis rate of seagrass Thalassia hemprichii. The study used Completely Randomized Design with 3 treatments control (8.10-8.50), medium pH (7.768.00) and low pH (7.50-7.75) in 5 replicates. The results showed that growth rate, photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content has a bigger value on control treatment than the low pH treatment. The ANOVA test results were not significant for all treatment variables and had a negative impact on the survival of seagrass.

TI  - Carbon sharing through physiological integration in the threatened seagrass Halophila johnsonii
AB  - Carbon sharing among ramets of the clonal marine angiosperm Halophila johnsonii Eiseman was investigated in plants collected from Biscayne Bay, Florida, USA, and cultured in a seawater-supplied greenhouse facility in Wilmington, North Carolina. Different ramets along four-ramet segments (genets) were shaded for 3 d. At the end of the shading period, neighboring ramets were supplied with (NaHCO3)-C-14, (5 mu Ci) to determine rates of carbon fixation and patterns of carbon allocation. The direction and degree of carbon support among ramets were determined by employing whole-plant autoradiography and scintillation spectrophotometry. Genets with shaded ramets were not statistically different in terms of carbon uptake per gram dry weight than genets with un-shaded ramets, suggesting that genet carbon uptake is unaffected by shading. Autoradiograms indicated a trend towards H. johnsonii allocating more carbon to younger parts of the genet. However, scintillation analysis showed no significant directionality in photosynthate allocation to ramets with respect to age or shading. Photosynthate was allocated to ramets proportional to their proximity to the source ramets rather than because of the condition of the neighboring ramets. The fast turnover and short lived deterministic leaves of H. johnsonii suggest that no advantage may be gained by selectively supporting ramets based on condition or age. The physiological strategy we describe indicates that H. johnsonii does not support stressed ramets along its genet. Along with this species' low capacity for storage, our data suggest that vegetative growth over large unsuitable patches may be unlikely and that H. johnsonii's ability to recover from widespread habitat loss may be limited.

TI  - Important Value Index and Biomass (Estimation) of Seagrass on Talango Island, Sumenep, Madura
AB  - Seagrass is the only plant that can live in shallow waters, and in groups with the same species (monospecies), as well as with different species (heterospecies), and form a seagrass bed. Seagrass beds have an important ecological role, one of them as a carbon storage in shallow water. Seagrasses can store carbon in the form of biomass from its body. Seagrass beds can be found on Talango Island, Sumenep, Madura. Exploration of seagrass beds in this location has not been carried out, especially related to its potential in storing carbon. The aim of this study was to find out the important value index of seagrass species and to estimate their biomass. This research was conducted from October to November 2016 at two stations on Talango Island, Sumenep, Madura, using the Point Intercept Transect (PIT) method. The data taken during the research comprise the species diversity, density, covering and frequency of seagrass. Data analysis was performed to obtain the important value index and to estimate the biomass of seagrass species. The results show that Enhalus acoroides have the highest important value index. Furthermore, the highest biomass estimation value is obtained from Enhalus acoroides, which is 1,650 gram/Ha. Moreover, the total estimation of the seagrass bed on Talango Island is 1,721.250 gram/Ha.

TI  - Biomass Transfer Subsidizes Nitrogen to Offshore Food Webs
AB  - We evaluated the potential contribution of allochthonous biomass subsidies to the upper trophic levels of offshore food webs in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico (GOM). We made this evaluation considering nitrogen, an essential and often limiting nutrient in coastal ecosystems, to estimate the potential production of within-ecosystem biomass relative to the known import of biomass from an adjacent seagrass-dominated ecosystem. When adjusted for trophic transfer efficiency, we found the biomass subsidy from a single species (pinfish, Lagodon rhomboides) from nearshore seagrass habitat to the offshore GOM to be greater than the amount of nitrogen exported by two major rivers and local submarine ground water discharge. Our calculations show that seagrass-derived biomass accounts for approximately 25\% of the total potential production in the northeastern GOM. This estimate is in agreement with a previous study that found 18.5-25\% of the biomass in a predatory reef fish was derived from seagrass biomass inputs. These results indicate that all of the sources we consider account for the majority of the nitrogen available to the food web in the northeastern GOM. Our approach could be adapted to other coupled ecosystems to determine the relative importance of biomass subsidies to coastal ocean food webs.

TI  - Blue Carbon Storage in Tropical Seagrass Meadows Relates to Carbonate Stock Dynamics, Plantâ€“Sediment Processes, and Landscape Context: Insights from the Western Indian Ocean
AB  - Globally, seagrass ecosystems are considered major blue carbon sinks and thus indirect contributors to climate change mitigation. Quantitative estimates and multi-scale appraisals of sources that underlie long-term storage of sedimentary carbon are vital for understanding coastal carbon dynamics. Across a tropicalâ€“subtropical coastal continuum in the Western Indian Ocean, we estimated organic (Corg) and inorganic (Ccarb) carbon stocks in seagrass sediment. Quantified levels and variability of the two carbon stocks were evaluated with regard to the relative importance of environmental attributes in terms of plantâ€“sediment properties and landscape configuration. The explored seagrass habitats encompassed low to moderate levels of sedimentary Corg (ranging from 0.20 to 1.44% on average depending on species- and site-specific variability) but higher than unvegetated areas (ranging from 0.09 to 0.33% depending on site-specific variability), suggesting that some of the seagrass areas (at tropical Zanzibar in particular) are potentially important as carbon sinks. The amount of sedimentary inorganic carbon as carbonate (Ccarb) clearly corresponded to Corg levels, and as carbonates may represent a carbon source, this could diminish the strength of seagrass sediments as carbon sinks in the region. Partial least squares modelling indicated that variations in sedimentary Corg and Ccarb stocks in seagrass habitats were primarily predicted by sediment density (indicating a negative relationship with the content of carbon stocks) and landscape configuration (indicating a positive effect of seagrass meadow area, relative to the area of other major coastal habitats, on carbon stocks), while seagrass structural complexity also contributed, though to a lesser extent, to model performance. The findings suggest that accurate carbon sink assessments require an understanding of plantâ€“sediment processes as well as better knowledge of how sedimentary carbon dynamics are driven by cross-habitat links and sinkâ€“source relationships in a scale-dependent landscape context, which should be a priority for carbon sink conservation.

The regional patterns and causes of spatial variation, however, remain uncertain. The sparsity and regional bias of studies on soil OC stocks from Chinese VCHs have limited the reliable estimation of their capacity as regional and global OC sinks. Here, we use field and published data from 262 sampled soil cores and 181 surface soils to report estimates of soil OC stocks, burial rates and losses of VCHs in China. We find that Chinese mangrove, salt marsh and seagrass habitats have relatively low OC stocks, storing 6.3 +/- 0.6, 7.5 +/- 0.6, and 1.6 +/- 0.6 Tg C (+/- 95\% confidence interval) in the top meter of the soil profile with burial rates of 44 +/- 17, 159 +/- 57, and 6 +/- 45 Gg C/year, respectively. The variability in the soil OC stocks is linked to biogeographic factors but is mostly impacted by sedimentary processes and anthropic activities. All habitats have experienced significant losses, resulting in estimated emissions of 94.2-395.4 Tg CO(2)e (carbon dioxide equivalent) over the past 70 years. Reversing this trend through conservation and restoration measures has, therefore, great potential in contributing to the mitigation of climate change while providing additional benefits. This assessment, on a national scale from highly sedimentary environments under intensive anthropogenic pressures, provides important insights into blue carbon sink mechanism and sequestration capacities, thus contributing to the synchronous progression of global blue carbon management.

TI  - Methane emission and sulfide levels increase in tropical seagrass sediments during temperature stress: A mesocosm experiment
AB  - Climate change-induced ocean warming is expected to greatly affect carbon dynamics and sequestration in vegetated shallow waters, especially in the upper subtidal where water temperatures may fluctuate considerably and can reach high levels at low tides. This might alter the greenhouse gas balance and significantly reduce the carbon sink potential of tropical seagrass meadows. In order to assess such consequences, we simulated temperature stress during low tide exposures by subjecting seagrass plants (Thalassia hemprichii) and associated sediments to elevated midday temperature spikes (31, 35, 37, 40, and 45Â°C) for seven consecutive days in an outdoor mesocosm setup. During the experiment, methane release from the sediment surface was estimated using gas chromatography. Sulfide concentration in the sediment pore water was determined spectrophotometrically, and the plant's photosynthetic capacity as electron transport rate (ETR), and maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) was assessed using pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry. The highest temperature treatments (40 and 45Â°C) had a clear positive effect on methane emission and the level of sulfide in the sediment and, at the same time, clear negative effects on the photosynthetic performance of seagrass plants. The effects observed by temperature stress were immediate (within hours) and seen in all response variables, including ETR, Fv/Fm, methane emission, and sulfide levels. In addition, both the methane emission and the size of the sulfide pool were already negatively correlated with changes in the photosynthetic rate (ETR) during the first day, and with time, the correlations became stronger. These findings show that increased temperature will reduce primary productivity and increase methane and sulfide levels. Future increases in the frequency and severity of extreme temperature events could hence reduce the climate mitigation capacity of tropical seagrass meadows by reducing CO2 sequestration, increase damage from sulfide toxicity, and induce the release of larger amounts of methane.

TI  - Variability of sedimentary organic carbon in patchy seagrass landscapes
AB  - Seagrass ecosystems, considered among the most efficient carbon sinks worldwide, encompass a wide variety of spatial configurations in the coastal landscape. Here we evaluated the influence of the spatial configuration of seagrass meadows at small scales (metres) on carbon storage in seagrass sediments. We intensively sampled carbon stocks and other geochemical properties (Î´13C, particle size, depositional fluxes) across seagrass-sand edges in a Zostera muelleri patchy seagrass landscape. Carbon stocks were significantly higher (ca. 20%) inside seagrass patches than at seagrass-sand edges and bare sediments. Deposition was similar among all positions and most of the carbon was from allochthonous sources. Patch level attributes (e.g. edge distance) represent important determinants of the spatial heterogeneity of carbon stocks within seagrass ecosystems. Our findings indicate that carbon stocks of seagrass areas have likely been overestimated by not considering the influence of meadow landscapes, and have important relevance for the design of seagrass carbon stock assessments.

TI  - Impacts of land management practices on blue carbon stocks and greenhouse gas fluxes in coastal ecosystemsâ€”A meta-analysis
AB  - Global recognition of climate change and its predicted consequences has created the need for practical management strategies for increasing the ability of natural ecosystems to capture and store atmospheric carbon. Mangrove forests, saltmarshes and seagrass meadows, referred to as blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), are hotspots of atmospheric CO2 storage due to their capacity to sequester carbon at a far higher rate than terrestrial forests. Despite increased effort to understand the mechanisms underpinning blue carbon fluxes, there has been little synthesis of how management activities influence carbon stocks and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in BCEs. Here, we present a global meta-analysis of 111 studies that measured how carbon stocks and GHG fluxes in BCEs respond to various coastal management strategies. Research effort has focused mainly on restoration approaches, which resulted in significant increases in blue carbon after 4Â years compared to degraded sites, and the potential to reach parity with natural sites after 7â€“17Â years. Lesser studied management alternatives, such as sediment manipulation and altered hydrology, showed only increases in biomass and weaker responses for soil carbon stocks and sequestration. The response of GHG emissions to management was complex, with managed sites emitting less than natural reference sites but emitting more compared to degraded sites. Individual GHGs also differed in their responses to management. To date, blue carbon management studies are underrepresented in the southern hemisphere and are usually limited in duration (61% of studies &lt;3Â years duration). Our meta-analysis describes the current state of blue carbon management from the available data and highlights recommendations for prioritizing conservation management, extending monitoring time frames of BCE carbon stocks, improving our understanding of GHG fluxes in open coastal systems and redistributing management and research effort into understudied, high-risk areas.

TI  - Seagrass ecosystem metabolic carbon capture in response to green turtle grazing across Caribbean meadows
AB  - Increasing green turtle abundance will lead to increased grazing within seagrass habitats-ecosystems that are important for carbon sequestration and storage. However, it is not well understood how carbon dynamics in these ecosystems respond to grazing and whether a response differs among meadows or locations. We measured seagrass ecosystem metabolism in grazed and ungrazed areas of Thalassia testudinum meadows with established green turtle foraging areas across the Greater Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. We sampled meadows from five locations that differed in seagrass and environmental characteristics. Established meadows of the invasive seagrass Halophila stipulacea were also present at two of these locations, and we measured ecosystem metabolism in these meadows for comparison to grazed and ungrazed areas of the native T. testudinum. Across all individual sites, rates of net ecosystem production (NEP) ranged from 56\% to 96\% lower in grazed areas than ungrazed areas of T. testudinum meadows. Rates of NEP were also strongly, positively correlated with above-ground seagrass biomass across sites. While metabolic carbon capture rates were lower in grazed areas, heterotrophic respiration was not stimulated, and grazing therefore did not result in significant metabolic remineralization of carbon in these meadows. NEP in H. stipulacea meadows was similar to rates in T. testudinum meadows at all three sites, suggesting that metabolic carbon capture may remain similar in Caribbean meadows where this invasive seagrass is replacing native species. Synthesis. Our results show that there is a consistent response in metabolic carbon dynamics to green turtle grazing in T. testudinum meadows across the Greater Caribbean region. An increase in grazing will not likely stimulate remineralization of carbon as these important habitats are returned to a natural grazed state.

TI  - Carbon and nitrogen allocation strategy in Posidonia oceanica is altered by seawater acidification
AB  - Rising atmospheric CO2 causes ocean acidification that represents one of the major ecological threats for marine biota. We tested the hypothesis that long-term exposure to increased CO2 level and acidification in a natural CO2 vent system alters carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) metabolism in Posidonia oceanica L. (Delile), affecting its resilience, or capability to restore the physiological homeostasis, and the nutritional quality of organic matter available for grazers. Seawater acidification decreased the C to N ratio in P. oceanica tissues and increased grazing rate, shoot density, leaf proteins and asparagine accumulation in rhizomes, while the maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II was unaffected. The 13C-dilution in both structural and non-structural C metabolites in the acidified site indicated quali-quantitative changes of C source and/or increased isotopic fractionation during C uptake and carboxylation associated with the higher CO2 level. The decreased C:N ratio in the acidified site suggests an increased N availability, leading to a greater storage of 15Nâ€“enriched compounds in rhizomes. The amount of the more dynamic C storage form, sucrose, decreased in rhizomes of the acidified site in response to the enhanced energy demand due to higher shoot recruitment and N compound synthesis, without affecting starch reserves. The ability to modulate the balance between stable and dynamic C reserves could represent a key ecophysiological mechanism for P. oceanica resilience under environmental perturbation. Finally, alteration in C and N dynamics promoted a positive contribution of this seagrass to the local food web. Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - How Does Ocean Acidification Affect the Early Life History of Zostera marina? A Series of Experiments Find Parental Carryover Can Benefit Viability or Germination
AB  - Elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) as a concomitant of global climate change may facilitate the establishment of future seagrass meadows and subsequently its benefit could be incorporated into techniques to increase restoration success. In five manipulative experiments, we determined how increased CO2 affects the maturation of flowers, and the development of seeds and seedlings for the foundation species Zostera marina. Experiments tested the development from both seeds collected from non-treated flowering shoots (direct) and seeds harvested from flowering shoots after CO2 exposure (parental carryover). Flowering shoots were collected along the western coast of Sweden near the island of Skafto. The seeds produced were used in experiments conducted at Kristineberg, Sweden and Dauphin Island, AL, United States. Experiments varied in temperature (16, 18Â°C) and salinity (19, 33 ppt), as well as duration and magnitude of elevated CO2 exposure. Environmental conditions among experiments, such as temperature (16, 18Â°C) and salinity (19, 33 ppt), as well as duration and magnitude of pCO2 exposure differed. Flowering maturation, spathe number, seed production, and indicators of seed quality did not appear to be affected by 39â€“69 days of exposure to CO2 conditions outside of natural variability (pCO2 = 1547.2 Â± 267.60 Î¼atm; pHT = 7.53 Â± 0.07). Yet, seeds produced from these flowers showed twofold greater germination success. In another experiment, flowering shoots were exposed to an extreme CO2 condition (pCO2 = 5950.7 Â± 1,849.82 Î¼atm; pHT = 6.96 Â± 0.15). In this case, flowers generated seeds that demonstrated a fivefold increase in an indicator for seed viability (sinking velocity). In the latter experiment, however, germination appeared unaffected. Direct CO2 effects on germination and seedling production were not observed. Our results provide evidence of a parental CO2 effect that can benefit germination or seed viability, but early benefits may not lead to bed establishment if other environmental conditions are not well suited for seedling development. Outcomes have implications for restoration; CO2 can be supplied to flowering shoot holding tanks to bolster success when the purpose is to redistribute seeds to locations where beds are extant and water quality is adequate.

TI  - Limits on carbon sequestration in arid blue carbon ecosystems
AB  - Coastal ecosystems produce and sequester significant amounts of carbon ("blue carbon"), which has been well documented in humid and semi-humid regions of temperate and tropical climates but less so in arid regions where mangroves, marshes, and seagrasses exist near the limit of their tolerance for extreme temperature and salinity. To better understand these unique systems, we measured whole-ecosystem carbon stocks in 58 sites across the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in natural and planted mangroves, salt marshes, seagrass beds, microbial mats, and coastal sabkha (inter- and supratidal unvegetated salt flats). Natural mangroves held significantly more carbon in above- and belowground biomass than other vegetated ecosystems. Planted mangrove carbon stocks increased with age, but there were large differences for sites of similar age. Soil carbon varied widely across sites (2-367 Mg C/ha), with ecosystem averages that ranged from 49 to 156 Mg C/ha. For the first time, microbial mats were documented to contain soil carbon pools comparable to vascular plant-dominated ecosystems, and could arguably be recognized as a unique blue carbon ecosystem. Total ecosystem carbon stocks ranged widely from 2 to 515 Mg C/ha (seagrass bed and mangrove, respectively). Seagrass beds had the lowest carbon stock per unit area, but the largest stock per total area due to their large spatial coverage. Compared to similar ecosystems globally, mangroves and marshes in the UAE have lower plant and soil carbon stocks; however, the difference in soil stocks is far larger than with plant stocks. This incongruent difference between stocks is likely due to poor carbon preservation under conditions of weakly reduced soils (200-350 mV), coarse-grained sediments, and active shoreline migration. This work represents the first attempt to produce a country-wide coastal ecosystem carbon accounting using a uniform sampling protocol, and was motivated by specific policy goals identified by the Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative. These carbon stock data supported two objectives: to quantify carbon stocks and infer sequestration capacity in arid blue carbon ecosystems, and to explore the potential to incorporate blue carbon science into national reporting and planning documents.

TI  - A review of carbon monitoring in wet carbon systems using remote sensing
AB  - Carbon monitoring is critical for the reporting and verification of carbon stocks and change. Remote sensing is a tool increasingly used to estimate the spatial heterogeneity, extent and change of carbon stocks within and across various systems. We designate the use of the term wet carbon system to the interconnected wetlands, ocean, river and streams, lakes and ponds, and permafrost, which are carbon-dense and vital conduits for carbon throughout the terrestrial and aquatic sections of the carbon cycle. We reviewed wet carbon monitoring studies that utilize earth observation to improve our knowledge of data gaps, methods, and future research recommendations. To achieve this, we conducted a systematic review collecting 1622 references and screening them with a combination of text matching and a panel of three experts. The search found 496 references, with an additional 78 references added by experts. Our study found considerable variability of the utilization of remote sensing and global wet carbon monitoring progress across the nine systems analyzed. The review highlighted that remote sensing is routinely used to globally map carbon in mangroves and oceans, whereas seagrass, terrestrial wetlands, tidal marshes, rivers, and permafrost would benefit from more accurate and comprehensive global maps of extent. We identified three critical gaps and twelve recommendations to continue progressing wet carbon systems and increase cross system scientific inquiry.

TI  - Using scientific diving to investigate the long-term effects of ocean acidification at CO2 vents
AB  - We are using SCUBA to document ecosystem responses to long-term ocean acidification at volcanic CO2 vents. There are 30% reductions in biodiversity at average pH 7.8-7.9 (minimum pH 7.4), compared with areas with normal pH (8.1-8.2). Some groups (seagrasses and many algae) are tolerant of the increased CO2 levels but others (corals, sea urchins and calcified algae) are removed from the ecosystem. Transplant experiments show dissolution of calcareous organisms and our study demonstrates, for the first time, what happens to coastal marine ecosystems when key groups of species are killed due to rising CO2 levels.

TI  - An unintended ecological benefit from human intervention: The enhancement of carbon storage in seagrass meadows
AB  - Human interventions have had unintended consequences for the diverse functions of various ecosystems. Hydrological interventions have the potential to alter vegetated habitats in coastal nearshore ecosystems, but little is known about the impacts on organic carbon (Corg) sequestration, which plays an important role in climate change mitigation. We examined the effects of past human interventions through artificial inlet opening in a lagoonal seagrass meadow. The sediment profiles of geological and biogeochemical characteristics were measured to obtain the historical changes in the lagoon environment and Corg accumulation rates. Isotopic and elemental signatures and diatom assemblages showed that the interventions increased the duration of seawater exchanges and the extent of the seagrass meadow. Corg accumulation rates increased more than 1.9-fold after the intervention, resulting in additional Corg storage in the seagrass meadow during last 64Â years. Synthesis and applications. Artificial opening of tidal inlet can potentially provide unintended ecological benefits, such as increased carbon sequestration in seagrass meadows. Hydrological interventions could be undertaken intentionally as a potential active intervention to sequester carbon, as well as control flood risk and provide other benefits to people in estuarine systems. Our results illustrate that physical factors such as improving salinity conditions and mineral particle supply have an impact on the feasibility of hydrological interventions for enhancing carbon sequestration. We propose that biogeochemicalâ€“physical coupled approach will help stakeholders to evaluate the ecological and social risks and synergies of implementing hydrological interventions.

TI  - Radically different lignin composition in Posidonia species may link to differences in organic carbon sequestration capacity
AB  - There is considerable variability in the ability of seagrass ecosystems to sequester organic carbon (Corg) in their sediments, which act as natural carbon sinks contributing to climate change mitigation. In this work, we studied the chemistry of two Posidonia seagrass species aiming to elucidate whether differences in chemical composition might explain differences in their Corg sequestration capacity. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) and Thermally assisted Hydrolysis and Methylation (THM) GC-MS data showed a remarkable difference in phenolic compound patterns between P. oceanica and P. australis bulk plants and individual organs (leaves, sheaths, roots and rhizomes). The lignin of P. australis generates a series of p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) products that are typical of herbaceous plants, whereas P. oceanica is particularly rich in p-hydroxybenzoic acid (pBA) derivatives. The structural characteristics of the lignins were further investigated by two-dimensional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (2D-NMR) spectroscopy and Derivatization Followed by Reductive Cleavage (DFRC), focusing on sheath tissues. The analyses confirmed important differences in the lignin content (19.8% in P. australis and 29.5% in P. oceanica) and composition between the two species; intriguingly, the cell-walls of P. oceanica sheaths were highly enriched in pBA, a component that was completely absent in P. australis. 2D-NMR and DFRC data further revealed that pBA was esterified to the lignin, acylating the Î³-OH of the lignin side-chain. Interestingly, P. oceanica lignin presented an extremely high degree of p-hydroxybenzoylation in both guaiacyl (73%) and syringyl (61%) lignin units; the highest p-hydroxybenzoylation degree reported in plant lignins to date. It is tempting to conclude that the higher Corg storage capacity of P. oceanica ecosystems might be related to the higher abundance of pBA-rich lignin and its recalcitrant nature.

TI  - A deep learning and gis approach for the optimal positioning of wave energy converters
AB  - Renewable Energy Sources provide a viable solution to the problem of ever-increasing climate change. For this reason, several countries focus on electricity production using alternative sources. In this paper, the optimal positioning of the installation of wave energy converters is examined taking into account geospatial and technical limitations. Geospatial constraints depend on Land Use classes and seagrass of the coastal areas, while technical limitations include meteorological conditions and the morphology of the seabed. Suitable installation areas are selected after the exclusion of points that do not meet the aforementioned restrictions. We implemented a Deep Neural Network that operates based on heterogeneous data fusion, in this case satellite images and time series of meteorological data. This fact implies the definition of a two-branches architecture. The branch that is trained with image data provides for the localization of dynamic geospatial classes in the potential installation area, whereas the second one is responsible for the classification of the region according to the potential wave energy using wave height and period time series. In making the final decision on the suitability of the potential area, a large number of static land use data play an important role. These data are combined with neural network predictions for the optimizing positioning of the Wave Energy Converters. For the sake of completeness and flexibility, a Multi-Task Neural Network is developed. This model, in addition to predicting the suitability of an area depending on seagrass patterns and wave energy, also predicts land use classes through Multi-Label classification process. The proposed methodology is applied in the marine area of the city of Sines, Portugal. The first neural network achieves 98.7% Binary Classification accuracy, while the Multi-Task Neural Network 97.5% in the same metric and 93.5% in the F1 score of the Multi-Label classification output.

TI  - Calcification-driven CO2 emissions exceed ``Blue Carbon{'' sequestration in a carbonate seagrass meadow
AB  - Long-term ``Blue Carbon{''} burial in seagrass meadows is complicated by other carbon and alkalinity exchanges that shape net carbon sequestration. We measured a suite of such processes, including denitrification, sulfur, and inorganic carbon cycling, and assessed their impact on air-water CO2 exchange in a typical seagrass meadow underlain by carbonate sediments. Eddy covariance measurements reveal a consistent source of CO2 to the atmosphere at an average rate of 610 +/- 990 mu mol m(-2) hour(-1) during our study and 700 +/- 660 mu mol m(-2) hour(-1) (6.1 mol m(-2) year(-1)) over an annual cycle. Net alkalinity consumption by ecosystem calcification explains >95\% of the observed CO2 emissions, far exceeding organic carbon burial and anaerobic alkalinity generation. We argue that the net carbon sequestration potential of seagrass meadows may be overestimated if calcification-induced CO2 emissions are not accounted for, especially in regions where calcification rates exceed net primary production and burial.

TI  - Dynamics and fate of blue carbon in a mangrove-seagrass seascape: influence of landscape configuration and land-use change
AB  - Context Seagrass meadows act as efficient natural carbon sinks by sequestering atmospheric CO2 and through trapping of allochthonous organic material, thereby preserving organic carbon (C-org) in their sediments. Less understood is the influence of landscape configuration and transformation (land-use change) on carbon sequestration dynamics in coastal seascapes across the land-sea interface. Objectives We explored the influence of landscape configuration and degradation of adjacent mangroves on the dynamics and fate of C-org in seagrass habitats. Methods Through predictive modelling, we assessed sedimentary C-org content, stocks and source composition in multiple seascapes (km-wide buffer zones) dominated by different seagrass communities in northwest Madagascar. The study area encompassed seagrass meadows adjacent to intact and deforested mangroves. Results The sedimentary C-org content was influenced by a combination of landscape metrics and inherent habitat plant- and sediment-properties. We found a strong land-to-sea gradient, likely driven by hydrodynamic forces, generating distinct patterns in sedimentary C-org levels in seagrass seascapes. There was higher C-org content and a mangrove signal in seagrass surface sediments closer to the deforested mangrove area, possibly due to an escalated export of C-org from deforested mangrove soils. Seascapes comprising large continuous seagrass meadows had higher sedimentary C-org levels in comparison to more diverse and patchy seascapes. Conclusion Our results emphasize the benefit to consider the influence of seascape configuration and connectivity to accurately assess C-org content in coastal habitats. Understanding spatial patterns of variability and what is driving the observed patterns is useful for identifying carbon sink hotspots and develop management prioritizations.

TI  - Fingerprinting macrophyte Blue Carbon by pyrolysis-GC-compound specific isotope analysis (Py-CSIA)
AB  - There is a need for tools to determine the origin of organic matter (OM) in Blue Carbon Ecosystems (BCE) and marine sediments to (1) facilitate the implementation of Blue Carbon strategies into carbon accounting and crediting schemes and (2) decipher changes in ecosystem condition over decadal to millennial time scales and thus to understand and predict the stability of BCE in a changing world. Pyrolysis-GC-compound specific isotope analysis (Py-CSIA) is applied for the first time in marine environments and BCE research. We studied Australian mangrove, tidal marsh and seagrass sediments, in addition to potential sources of OM (Avicennia, Posidonia, Zostera, Sarcocornia, Ecklonia and Ulva species and seagrass epiphytes), to identify precursors of different biomacromolecule constituents (lignin, polysaccharides and aliphatic structures). Firstly, the link between bulk Î´13C and Î´13C reconstructed from compound-specific Î´13C showed that the pyrolysis approach allows for the isotopic screening of a representative portion of the OM. Secondly, for all samples, the C isotope fingerprint of the carbohydrate products (plant polysaccharides) was the heaviest (13C enriched), followed by lignin and aliphatic products. The differences in Î´13C among macromolecules and the overlap in Î´13C among putative sources reflect the limitations of bulk Î´13C analyses for deciphering OM provenance. Thirdly, phanerogams specimen had the heaviest carbohydrate and lignin, confirming that seagrass-derived lignocellulose can be traced based on Î´13C. Consistent differences for individual compounds were identified between seagrasses and between Avicennia and Sarcocornia using Py-CSIA. Fourth, ecosystem shifts (colonization of seagrass habitats by mangrove) on millenary time scales, hypothesized in previous studies on the basis of bulk Î´13C and Py-GCâ€“MS, were confirmed by Py-CSIA. We conclude that Py-CSIA is useful in Blue Carbon research to decipher OM sources in marine sediments, identify ecosystem transitions in palaeoenvironmental records, and to understand the role of different OM compounds in Blue Carbon storage.

TI  - Seagrass carbon stock estimation in Panrangluhu coastal waters using remote sensing technology
AB  - Seagrass has many important roles, including in storing carbon in their biomass. However, information on carbon stock in seagrass in Indonesian waters is still very little, including the Panrangluhu coastal waters. This study aims to estimate the carbon storage of seagrass in Panrangluhu coastal waters using remote sensing technology and Level 1C Sentinel-2A imagery. The image was initially processed before unsupervised classification and a map of seagrass conditions classficiation (poor, unhealthy and healthy) was produced. Based on the map, field observation was conducted by choosing a random sampling location to estimate seagrass conditon and sample biomass. Measurement of oceanographic parameters (temperature and salinity) were also conducted. Samples were taken to the laboratory to calculate biomass and carbon content in order to estimate carbon stocks and create carbon stock maps. The results showed that the highest carbon stock for aboveground biomass of was Syringodium isoetifolium (7.16 gC / m2) and the lowest was Halophila ovalis (1.24gC / m2). Meanwhile, the highest belowground biomass was Enhalus acoroides (26.50 gC / m2) and the lowest was Halophila ovalis (5.56 gC / m2). The total carbon stock in Panrangluhu coastal waters was 19.97 tonnes. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Valuing Carbon Stocks across a Tropical Lagoon after Accounting for Black and Inorganic Carbon: Bulk Density Proxies for Monitoring
AB  - Total organic carbon (TOC) stocks of seagrass and mangroves across a Southeast Asian lagoon were measured and valued after correcting for black carbon (BC) and calcareous carbon equivalents (PICequiv) in mitigating CO2 emissions, along with sediment dry bulk densities (DBDs), as a cost-effective means of estimating carbon stock concepts. Overall, seagrass and mangrove TOC densities ranged from 15.3 Â± 4.3 and 124.3 Â± 21.1 Mg C ha-1, respectively, across the lower lagoon and 175.2 Â± 46.9 and 103.2 Â± 19.0 Mg C ha-1 for seagrass and 355.0 Â± 24.8 and 350.3 Â± 35.2 Mg C ha-1 for mangroves across the two upper lagoon branches. Only mangrove biomass made significant additional contributions, ranging from 178.5 Â± 62.3 to 120.7 Â± 94.8 Mg C ha-1 for lower and upper regions, respectively. The difference between the lagoon's seagrass and mangrove TOC total stock (5.98 Â± 0.69 and 390 Â± 33.22 Gg C, respectively) was further amplified by the larger mangrove area. When corrected for BC and PICequiv, the carbon stock mitigation service was reduced by a moderate 14.2%. Across the lagoon the sedimentary DBD showed strong (R2 = 0.85, p < 0.001) to moderate (R2 = 0.67, p < 0.001) linear correlations with seagrass and mangrove [TOC], respectively and moderate correlations with seagrass [PIC] (R2 = 0.6, p < 0.001). There was an invariant and relatively constant response to mangrove [PIC] (2.7 Â± 0.07 kg m-3). Valuations were worth on average US$0.44 million y-1 over 20 years, and less than the total income of the indigenous custodians (US$1.8 and US$7.4 million y-1).

TI  - Simulated coal spill causes mortality and growth inhibition in tropical marine organisms
AB  - Coal is a principal fossil fuel driving economic and social development, and increases in global coal shipments have paralleled expansion of the industry. To identify the potential harm associated with chronic marine coal contamination, three taxa abundant in tropical marine ecosystems (the coral Acropora tenuis, the reef fish Acanthochromis polyacanthus and the seagrass Halodule uninervis) were exposed to five concentrations (0-275 mg coal l(-1)) of suspended coal dust (< 63 mu m) over 28 d. Results demonstrate that chronic coal exposure can cause considerable lethal effects on corals, and reductions in seagrass and fish growth rates. Coral survivorship and seagrass growth rates were inversely related to increasing coal concentrations (>= 38 mg coal l(-1)) and effects increased between 14 and 28 d, whereas fish growth rates were similarly depressed at all coal concentrations tested. This investigation provides novel insights into direct coal impacts on key tropical taxa for application in the assessment of risks posed by increasing coal shipments in globally threatened marine ecosystems.

TI  - Seagrass (Halophila stipulacea) invasion enhances carbon sequestration in the Mediterranean Sea
AB  - The introduction and establishment of exotic species often result in significant changes in recipient communities and their associated ecosystem services. However, usually the magnitude and direction of the changes are difficult to quantify because there is no pre-introduction data. Specifically, little is known about the effect of marine exotic macrophytes on organic carbon sequestration and storage. Here, we combine dating sediment cores (Pb-210) with sediment eDNA fingerprinting to reconstruct the chronology of pre- and post-arrival of the Red Sea seagrass Halophila stipulacea spreading into the Eastern Mediterranean native seagrass meadows. We then compare sediment organic carbon storage and burial rates before and after the arrival of H. stipulacea and between exotic (H. stipulacea) and native (C. nodosa and P. oceanica) meadows since the time of arrival following a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) approach. This analysis revealed that H. stipulacea arrived at the areas of study in Limassol (Cyprus) and West Crete (Greece) in the 1930s and 1970s, respectively. Average sediment organic carbon after the arrival of H. stipulacea to the sites increased in the exotic meadows twofold, from 8.4 +/- 2.5 g C-org m(-2 )year(-1) to 14.7 +/- 3.6 g C-org m(-2 )year(-1), and, since then, burial rates in the exotic seagrass meadows were higher than in native ones of Cymodocea nodosa and Posidonia oceanica. Carbon isotopic data indicated a 50\% increase of the seagrass contribution to the total sediment C-org pool since the arrival of H. stipulacea. Our results demonstrate that the invasion of H. stipulacea may play an important role in maintaining the blue carbon sink capacity in the future warmer Mediterranean Sea, by developing new carbon sinks in bare sediments and colonizing areas previously occupied by the colder thermal affinity P. oceanica.

TI  - Seagrass Organic Carbon Stocks Show Minimal Variation Over Short Time Scales in a Heterogeneous Subtropical Seascape
AB  - Blue carbon initiatives require accurate monitoring of carbon stocks. We examined sources of variability in seagrass organic carbon (C-org) stocks, contrasting spatial with short temporal scales. Seagrass morphology and sediment C-org stocks were measured from biomass and shallow sediment cores collected in Moreton Bay, Australia. Samples were collected between 2012 and 2013, from a total of 77 sites that spanned a gradient of water turbidity. Environmental measures of water quality between 2000 and 2013 revealed strong seasonal fluctuations from summer to winter, yet seagrass biomass exhibited no temporal variation. There was no temporal variability in C-org stocks, other than below ground biomass stocks were slightly higher in June 2013. Seagrass locations were grouped into riverine, coastal, and seagrass loss locations and short temporal variability of C-org stocks was analysed within these categories to provide clearer insights into temporal patterns. Above ground C-org stocks were similar between coastal and riverine meadows. Below ground C-org stocks were highest in coastal meadows, followed by riverine meadows. Sediment C-org stocks within riverine meadows were much higher than at coastal meadows and areas of seagrass loss, with no difference in sediment C-org stocks between these last two categories. Riverine seagrass meadows, of higher turbidity, had greater total C-org stocks than meadows in offshore areas irrespective of time. We suggest that C-org stock assessment should prioritise sampling over spatial gradients, but repeated monitoring over short time scales is less likely to be warranted if environmental conditions remain stable.

TI  - Seagrass ecosystems: Contributions to and mechanisms of carbon sequestration
AB  - The ocean's vegetated habitats, in particular seagrasses, mangroves and salt marshes, each capture and store a comparable amount of carbon per year, forming the Earth's blue carbon sinks, the most intense carbon sinks on the planet. Seagrass meadows, characterized by high prima-ry productivity, efficient water column filtration and sediment stability, have a pronounced capacity for carbon sequestration. This is enhanced by low decomposition rates in anaerobic seagrass sediments. The carbon captured by seagrass meadows contributes significantly to the total blue carbon. At a global scale, seagrass ecosystems are carbon sink hot spots and have profound influences on the global carbon cycle. This importance combined with the many other functions of seagrass meadows places them among the most valuable ecosystems in the world. Unfortunately, seagrasses are declining globally at an alarming rate owing to anthropogenic disturbances and climate change, making them also among the most threatened ecosystems on the Earth. The role of coastal systems in carbon sequestration has received far too little attention and thus there are still many uncertainties in evaluating carbon sequestration of global seagrass meadows accurately. To better assess the carbon sequestration of global seagrass ecosystems, a number of scientific issues should be considered with high priorities: 1) more accurate measurements of seagrass coverage at national and global levels; 2) more comprehensive research into species-and location-specific carbon sequestration efficiencies; 3) in-depth exploration of the effects of human disturbance and global climate change on car-bon capture and storage by seagrass ecosystems.

TI  - Carbon stock of the seagrass Enhalus acoroides and Thalassia hemprichii in Tanjung Tiram coastal waters, Poka, Ambon Island
AB  - Seagrass is a marine plant that can reduce carbon dioxide by storing carbon and can bind carbon in thousands of years. The ability of seagrass beds as a carbon sink can be determined by calculating carbon stocks. The purpose of this study was to analyze the carbon stock of seagrass Enhalus acoroides and Thalassia hemprichii. This research took place at Tanjung Tiram Coastal Waters, Poka Village, Ambon Island on June 2019. The study was conducted at two different stations, namely station one on mixed sand and gravel substrates and station two on mixed sand and mud substrates. Carbon content was analyzed by using the Walkley and Black method. The results of the study showed that carbon stock of E. acoroides ranged from 78.89 gC.m(-2) to 107.42 gC.m(-2) and was higher than T. hemprichii, which ranges from 50.04 gC.m(-2) to 64.75 gC.m(-2). The carbon stock was higher in the bellow ground component, especially in rhizome which was 46.94 gC. m(-2) - 61 gC.m(-2) (E. acoroides) and 25.74 gC.m-2 - 33.59 gC.m(-2) (T. hemprichii). Seagrass beds in the mixed sand and mud substrates have a higher carbon stock and can store more carbon.

TI  - Above ground blue carbon sequestration capacity of Sungai Pulai estuary seagrass meadows - A satellite based method
AB  - Monitoring blue carbon (C) sequestration potential within coastal ecosystem is essential for enhancing climate change mitigation initiatives. Although remote sensing is known as a useful method for mapping benthic habitat and monitoring changes at large spatial scale compared to field survey methods, it has not been attempted for quantifying seagrass C stock. A satellite-based mapping approach, applied on Landsat imagery (acquired in 2004, 2009 and 2013) and field biomass data obtained from previous studies were used for repeat mapping of above ground seagrass C for the turbid water of the Sungai Pulai estuary, Johor Straits, Malaysia. The mapping approach has demonstrated (1) the ability to determine total above ground seagrass C sequestration capacity and identify the areas of highest C stock cover class from the spatially extensive biomass map, and (2) the spatio-temporal dynamics of seagrass C stocks that can be used to assess and monitor C fluxes and (3) informing costal managers to decide which data to be used and method to apply for monitoring climate change related activities when project demands a spatially explicit maps. According to the estimates, the highest mean C stock was in 2004 (90.68 kg C/pixel) and the lowest in 2013 (18.77 kg C/pixel) - a declining trend of seagrass cover, biomass and C stocks in the Sungai Pulai estuary. Further studies on the Sungai Pulai estuary should be conducted to identify C pools and to estimate total C stocks and fluxes in seagrass ecosystem.

TI  - Ocean acidification alters meiobenthic assemblage composition and organic matter degradation rates in seagrass sediments
AB  - Seagrass meadows are an important organic matter (OM) reservoir but, are currently being lost due to global and regional stressors. Yet, there is limited research investigating the cumulative impacts of anthropogenic stressors on the structure and functioning of seagrass benthic assemblages, key drivers of OM mineralization and burial. Here, using a 16-month field experiment, we assessed how meiobenthic assemblages and extracellular enzymatic activities (as a proxy of OM degradation) in Posidonia oceanica sediments responded to ocean acidification (OA) and nutrient loadings, at CO2 vents. P. oceanica meadows were exposed to three nutrient levels (control, moderate, and high) at both ambient and low pH sites. OA altered meiobenthic assemblage structure, resulting in increased abundance of annelids and crustaceans, along with a decline in foraminifera. In addition, low pH enhanced OM degradation rates in seagrass sediments by enhancing extracellular enzymatic activities, potentially decreasing the sediment carbon storage capacity of seagrasses. Nutrient enrichment had no effect on the response variables analyzed, suggesting that, under nutrient concentration unlikely to cause N or P imitation, a moderate increase of dissolved nutrients in the water column had limited influence on meiobenthic assemblages. These findings show that OA can significantly alter meiobenthic assemblage structure and enhance OM degradation rates in seagrass sediments. As meiofauna are ubiquitous key actors in the functioning of benthic ecosystems, we postulated that OA, altering the structure of meiobenthic assemblages and OM degradation, could affect organic carbon sequestration over large spatial scales.

TI  - THE USE OF FERTILIZER TO ENHANCE GROWTH OF TRANSPLANTED SEAGRASSES ZOSTERA-MARINA L AND HALODULE-WRIGHTII ASCHERS
AB  - The effect of two slow release fertilizers on the survival and growth of transplants of two seagrasses, Zostera marina L. and Halodule wrightii Aschers was examined. The two fertilizers, an unbalanced nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium formulation (18-0-0) and a balanced (14-14-14) formulation, were applied to bare root transplant units (PU) of each seagrass at three doses, 10, 90, and 170 g per PU. Survival and growth of the transplants, nutrient release from the fertilizers, and several environmental characteristics of the study sites were examined. Nitrogen enrichment enhanced vegetative reproduction, the rate of area covered and leaf growth in a fall transplant of Z. marina, but only moderately stimulated growth in the spring, confirming that nitrogen may limit the rate of development of newly established populations of Z. marina. There was no effect of nitrogen on survival of Z. marina nor on the growth and survival of H. wrightii transplants. No phosphorus was released from the balanced fertilizers in the spring and fall experiments and no nitrogen was released from the unbalanced formulation in the spring Z. marina experiment. Therefore, it was not possible to examine the effect of nitrogen and phosphorus interactions on plant growth and vegetative reproduction. Nitrogen enrichment may be used to stimulate shoot growth of Z. marina transplants, and we suggest alternative procedures of fertilizer application to overcome problems of nutrient release.

TI  - Exotic Halophila stipulacea is an introduced carbon sink for the Eastern Mediterranean Sea
AB  - Carbon and nitrogen storage in exotic Halophila stipulacea were compared to that in native Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa meadows and adjacent unvegetated sediments of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea and to that in native H. stipulacea of the Red Sea at sites with different biogeochemical conditions and level of human pressure. Exotic H. stipulacea possessed considerable storing capacity, with 2-fold higher Corg stock (0.71 Â± 0.05 kg mâˆ’2 in the top 20 cm of sediment) and burial (14.78 gCorg mâˆ’2 yâˆ’1) than unvegetated areas and C. nodosa meadows and, surprisingly, comparable to P. oceanica. N (0.07 Â± 0.01 kg mâˆ’2) and Cinorg (14.06 Â± 8.02 kg mâˆ’2) stocks were similar between H. stipulacea and C. nodosa or unvegetated sediments, but different to P. oceanica. Corg and N stocks were higher in exotic than native H. stipulacea populations. Based on isotopic mixing model, organic material trapped in H. stipulacea sediments was mostly allochthonous (seagrass detritus 17% vs seston 67%). Corg stock was similar between monospecific and invaded C. nodosa meadows by H. stipulacea. Higher stocks were measured in the higher human pressure site. H. stipulacea introduction may contribute in the increase of carbon sequestration in the Eastern Mediterranean. Â© 2019, The Author(s).

TI  - A question of standards: Adapting carbon and other PES markets to work for community seagrass conservation
AB  - Seagrass meadows deliver multiple ecosystem services that are of particular importance to resource-poor coastal communities, yet they are rapidly declining globally. The Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) approach has been used to fund the protection of other `Blue Carbon' Ecosystems (BCE), yet seagrass has been incorporated in just one PES project worldwide. Some of the ecosystem services delivered by seagrass have the potential for inclusion under a PES framework but multiple challenges currently make this difficult, particularly under community-based management. PES programmes typically focus on carbon as the tradable service, but scientific uncertainties regarding seagrass carbon are likely to remain significant barriers to using carbon as the sole commodity under current carbon trading standards and market conditions. It is recommended here that project developers demonstrate the multiple ecosystem services delivered by seagrass meadows, along with their importance to coastal communities, in the planning and marketing of seagrass PES projects. Moreover, they should consider approaches that incorporate seagrass meadows into other blue carbon certified projects. The capacities of the communities that rely most heavily on seagrass are generally very limited. Consequently, demanding high levels of scientific certainty over carbon stocks and flows will exclude most of these communities. Standards, buyers and policy makers should consider building community capacity in the technical and marketing requirements of voluntary carbon standards. The voluntary carbon market has the flexibility to pioneer certified seagrass carbon, potentially leading to the inclusion of seagrass carbon in formal policy instruments, such as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

TI  - Vulnerability of seagrass blue carbon to microbial attack following exposure to warming and oxygen
AB  - Seagrass meadows store globally-significant quantities of organic â€˜blueâ€™ carbon. These blue carbon stocks are potentially vulnerable to anthropogenic stressors (e.g. coastal development, climate change). Here, we tested the impact of oxygen exposure and warming (major consequences of human disturbance) on rates of microbial carbon break-down in seagrass sediments. Active microbes occurred throughout seagrass sediment profiles, but deep, ancient sediments (~5000 yrs. old) contained only 3% of the abundance of active microbes as young, surface sediments (<2 yrs. old). Metagenomic analysis revealed that microbial community structure and function changed with depth, with a shift from proteobacteria and high levels of genes involved in sulfur cycling in the near surface samples, to a higher proportion of firmicutes and euraracheota and genes involved in methanogenesis at depth. Ancient carbon consisted almost entirely (97%) of carbon considered â€˜thermally recalcitrantâ€™, and therefore presumably inaccessible to microbial attack. Experimental warming had little impact on carbon; however, exposure of ancient sediments to oxygen increased microbial abundance, carbon uptake and sediment carbon turnover (34â€“38 fold). Overall, this study provides detailed characterization of seagrass blue carbon (chemical stability, age, associated microbes) and suggests that environmental disturbances that expose coastal sediments to oxygen (e.g. dredging) have the capacity to diminish seagrass sediment carbon stocks by facilitating microbial remineralisation.

TI  - Major role of marine vegetation on the oceanic carbon cycle
AB  - The carbon burial in vegetated sediments, ignored in past assessments of carbon burial in the ocean, was evaluated using a bottom-up approach derived from upscaling a compilation of published individual estimates of carbon burial in vegetated habitats (seagrass meadows, salt marshes and mangrove forests) to the global level and a top-down approach derived from considerations of global sediment balance and a compilation of the organic carbon content of vegeatated sediments. Up-scaling of individual burial estimates values yielded a total carbon burial in vegetated habitats of 111 Tmol C y(-1). The total burial in unvegetated sediments was estimated to be 126 Tg C y(-1), resulting in a bottom-up estimate of total burial in the ocean of about 244 Tg C y(-1), two-fold higher than estimates of oceanic carbon burial that presently enter global carbon budgets. The organic carbon concentrations in vegetated marine sediments exceeds by 2 to 10-fold those in shelf/deltaic sediments. Top-down recalculation of ocean sediment budgets to account for these, previously neglected, organic-rich sediments, yields a top-down carbon burial estimate of 216 Tg C y(-1), with vegetated coastal habitats contributing about 50\%. Even though vegetated carbon burial contributes about half of the total carbon burial in the ocean, burial represents a small fraction of the net production of these ecosystems, estimated at about 3388 Tg C y(-1), suggesting that bulk of the benthic net ecosystem production must support excess respiration in other compartments, such as unvegetated sediments and the coastal pelagic compartment. The total excess organic carbon available to be exported to the ocean is estimated at between 1126 to 3534 Tg C y(-1), the bulk of which must be respired in the open ocean. Widespread loss of vegetated coastal habitats must have reduced carbon burial in the ocean by about 30 Tg Cy-1, identifying the destruction of these ecosystems as an important loss of CO2 sink capacity in the biosphere.

TI  - Global trends and prospects of blue carbon sinks: a bibliometric analysis
AB  - Blue carbon sinks (mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses) are considered an effective nature-based approach for climate change mitigation. Despite growing interest, a systematic review of this topic is still scarce. This study evaluated 1348 blue carbon sink-related articles from 1990 to 2020 using bibliometric technology. The results from total of 85 countries, 1538 institutions, and 4492 authors indicated that blue carbon sink research shows the characteristics of rapid growth. The most active country, institution, and author were USA, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Duarte C.M., respectively. Relatively close academic collaboration has formed in blue carbon science. Environmental Sciences was the most popular category with 590 papers. The percentages of articles related to mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses were 63.87%, 40.36%, and 40.65%, respectively. Mangrove carbon sinks are the most popular topic, and stable isotope and remote sensing are the most researched technologies for mapping and quantifying blue carbon sinks. The threats to blue carbon sinks are complex and distinctive. Restoration, conservation, and management of blue carbon ecosystems aimed to improve their carbon sink capacity are becoming hot issues and should be further investigated in the future. These findings provide a scientific roadmap for further research in this field and will enable stakeholders to identify the research trend.

TI  - Variability and Vulnerability of Coastal â€˜Blue Carbonâ€™ Stocks: A Case Study from Southeast Australia
AB  - â€˜Blue carbonâ€™ ecosystemsâ€”seagrasses, tidal marshes, and mangrovesâ€”serve as dense carbon sinks important for reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, yet only recently have stock estimates emerged. We sampled 96 blue carbon ecosystems across the Victorian coastline (southeast Australia) to quantify total sediment stocks, variability across spatial scales, and estimate emissions associated with historical ecosystem loss. Mean sediment organic carbon (Corg) stock (Â±SE) to a depth of 30Â cm was not significantly different between tidal marshes (87.1Â Â±Â 4.90Â Mg Corg haâˆ’1) and mangroves (65.6Â Â±Â 4.17Â Mg Corg haâˆ’1), but was significantly lower in seagrasses (24.3Â Â±Â 1.82Â Mg Corg haâˆ’1). Location (defined as an individual meadow, marsh, or forest) had a stronger relationship with Corg stock than catchment region, suggesting local-scale conditions drive variability of stocks more than regional-scale processes. We estimate over 2.90 millionÂ Â±Â 199,000Â Mg Corg in the top 30Â cm of blue carbon sediments in Victoria (53% in tidal marshes, 36% in seagrasses, and 11% in mangroves) and sequestration rates of 22,700Â Â±Â 5510Â Mg Corg yearâˆ’1 (valued at over $AUD1 millionÂ Â±Â 245,000 yearâˆ’1 based on the average price of AUD12.14Â Mg CO2 eqâˆ’1 at Australian Emissions Reduction Fund auctions). We estimate ecosystem loss since European settlement may equate to emissions as high as 4.83 millionÂ Â±Â 358,000Â Mg CO2 equivalents (assuming 90% remineralization of stocks), 98% of which was associated with tidal marsh loss, and what would have been sequestering 9360Â Â±Â 2500Â Mg Corg yearâˆ’1. This study is among the first to present a comprehensive comparison of sediment stocks across and within coastal blue carbon ecosystems. We estimate substantial and valuable carbon stocks associated with these ecosystems that have suffered considerable losses in the past and need protection into the future to maintain their role as carbon sinks.

TI  - The potential stocks and carbon uptake by seagrass meadows at Pari Island, Kepulauan Seribu, Indonesia
AB  - The development of human civilization during the last century has increased carbon dioxide content in nature that will contribute to global climate change. However, ocean water will reduce this increase by absorbing CO2. The increasing CO2 content in the ocean could decrease pH and carbonate ion, which will have negative impacts on the life of marine organisms, food production and human life. Seagrass meadows through photosynthetic processes could absorb CO2 and store carbon in large amounts for an extended period. This process could be the strategic way of resolving global climate change. The purpose of this research was to identify the species of seagrass, quantify the density and coverage of seagrass, and calculate biomass and carbon stock in seagrass meadows at Pari Island, Kepulauan Seribu. The research was carried out in February 2019. This research used quantitative field observation with the purposive sampling method. Samples were collected from 3 locations with nine stations. The obtained samples were analyzed at the Laboratory of Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Science, Diponegoro University. Carbon and sediment samples were analyzed using Loss in the Ignition (LOI) method. The results showed that there are three species of seagrass in Pari Island, i.e. Enhalus acoroides, Thalassia hemprichii, and Cymodocea rotundata. Total density value was 129.19 individual m(-2) and total coverage value was 62.59\%. Total stock potential of carbon value in Pari Island was 87.80 ton per ha with total area of seagrass meadows of 3.48 ha. Silty-sands mainly dominated sediment textures. It can be concluded that seagrass meadows are potential habitats to control CO2 concentration in coastal waters and to hold the rate of climate change.

TI  - Effect of environmental stress on non-structural carbohydrates reserves and transfer in seagrasses
AB  - The seagrass bed is one of the most productive wetland ecosystems, providing valuable ecological goods and services. About 2%-5% of seagarss populations disappeared each year on Earth, which has been due to a wide variety of human and natural disturbances in recent years. The dynamics of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) reserves play an important role in determining seagrass growth and its response to environmental disturbances. In order to improve our understanding of the NSC in seagrasses, the information on the NSC responses to environmental stresses, such as light, nutrient, salinity, ocean acidification, temperature, sulfide and animal grazing were summarized. Seagrasses are particularly sensitive to reductions in light availability, where small decreases can cause significant declines in growth and distribution. During periods of reduced photosynthesis caused by light limitation, the stored NSC in belowground tissue can be reallocated to meet the C (Carbon) demand of seagrasses. Thus, seagrass species with higher belowground biomass and carbohydrate storage capacity can tolerate longer period of light limitation. Nitrogen assimilation requires carbon skeletons for the respiratory pathway and reserves. Under excessive nitrogen conditions, carbon requirements for synthesizing amino acids may exceed carbon fixation capacity, leading to a decrease in NSC concentration and NSC reserves reallocation. Under hypo- and hypersaline conditions, a number of organic compounds in seagrass including soluble sugar can be produced in response to salinity stress. Furthermore, carbon skeletons are also important for the synthesis and accumulation of proline (and other nitrogen containing osmotica such as glycine betaine or ectoine) during elevated salinities. Ocean acidification may promote seagrass photosynthesis, resulting in an increase of NSC synthesis in aboveground tissue and transfer to belowground tissue. And the belowground tissues of seagrass became a sink for fixed carbon. The effect of temperature on the NSC accumulation was significant by means of altering seagrass photosynthesis, respiration and nitrogen metabolism. Additionally, the decrease of NSC biosynthesis and reserves was resulted from both sulfide and animal grazing by inhibiting the enzyme activity and grazing seagrass photosynthetic tissue, respectively. Finally, research fields in the future are pointed out including: (1) the transformation mechanism between NSC and structural carbohydrates, and between soluble sugar and starch of seagrass in different life stage (seed dormancy and germination, development and reproduction); (2) the coupling impact of dual and/or more environmental factors on seagrass NSC; (3) the application of NSC as an ecological indicator for evaluating the seagrass ecosystem health evaluation.

TI  - Response of seagrass 'Blue Carbon' stocks to increased water temperatures
AB  - Seagrass meadows are globally important sinks of 'Blue Carbon', but warming water temperatures due to climate change may undermine their capacity to sequester and retain organic carbon (Corg). We tested the effects of warming on seagrass Corg stocks in situ by transplanting seagrass soil cores along a thermal plume generated by a coal-fired power plant in a seagrass-dominated estuary (Lake Macquarie, Australia). Transplanted cores were subjected to temperatures 2 and 4 Â°C above ambient temperatures and Corg content was measured after 7, 30, 90 and 180 days. We were unable to detect any significant effect of warming on Corg concentration, stocks, chemical composition (as measured by labile, recalcitrant, refractory ratios), or microbial abundance at any time point. In fact, Corg levels were temporally variable. These findings contrast those of previous studies (mostly laboratory-based) that have reported increases in microbial remineralisation (breakdown) of Corg in response to warming. To explain the lack of any detectable warming effect, we suggest that higher temperatures, longer durations of warming exposure, or additional stressors (e.g., oxygen exposure) may be needed to overcome microbial activation barriers and stimulate Corg remineralisation.

TI  - The Science and Policy of the Verified Carbon Standard Methodology for Tidal Wetland and Seagrass Restoration
AB  - The restoration of tidal wetland and seagrass systems has the potential for significant greenhouse gas benefits, but project-level accounting procedures have not been available at an international scale. In this paper, we describe the Verified Carbon Standard Methodology for Tidal Wetland and Seagrass Restoration, which provides greenhouse gas accounting procedures for marsh, mangrove, tidal forested wetland, and seagrasses systems across a diversity of geomorphic conditions and restoration techniques. We discuss and critique the essential science and policy elements of the methodology and underlying knowledge gaps. We developed a method for estimating mineral-protected (recalcitrant) allochthonous carbon in tidal wetland systems using field-collected soils data and literature-derived default values of the recalcitrant carbon that accompanies mineral deposition. We provided default values for methane emissions from polyhaline soils but did not provide default values for freshwater, oligohaline, and mesohaline soils due to high variability of emissions in these systems. Additional topics covered are soil carbon sequestration default values, soil carbon fate following erosion, avoided losses in organic and mineral soils, nitrous oxide emissions, soil profile sampling methods, sample size, prescribed fire, additionality, and leakage. Knowledge gaps that limit the application of the methodology include the estimation of CH4 emissions from fresh and brackish tidal wetlands, lack of validation of our approach for the estimation of recalcitrant allochthonous carbon, understanding of carbon oxidation rates following drainage of mineral tidal wetland soils, estimation of the effects of prescribed fire on soil carbon stocks, and the analysis of additionality for projects outside of the USA.

TI  - Assessment of WorldView-2 images for aboveground seagrass carbon stock mapping in patchy and continuous seagrass meadows
AB  - Spatially explicit information on aboveground seagrass carbon stock (AGC(seagrass)) is required to understand the role of seagrass as a nature-based solution to mitigating and adapting to climate change. Remote sensing provides the most effective and efficient means to map AGC(seagrass). This research aimed to assess the accuracy of multispectral images to map AGC in seagrass meadows with different characteristics. Kemujan Island in Indonesia was selected to represent patchy beds with relatively low seagrass percent cover and low water clarity, whereas Labuan Bajo of Indonesia served an example of continuous beds with a relatively high percent cover and water clarity. WorldView-2 is a high-spatial-resolution multispectral image with six visible bands, by which water can be penetrated. Several image processing techniques, including sunglint and water column correction, principal component analysis, and co-occurrence texture analysis, were applied to the atmospherically corrected WorldView-2 images. These datasets were used as inputs in the AGC empirical model using seven regression algorithms, namely, single-band linear regression, band-ratio linear regression, stepwise regression, random forest regression, support vector regression, extreme gradient boosting, and multivariate adaptive regression spline. Seagrass field data collected using photo quadrat technique were used to train the regression model and assess the accuracy of the resulting AGC(seagrass) maps. The results indicated that WorldView-2 can be used to map AGC in different seagrass meadows with a consistent accuracy. The most accurate AGC(seagrass) map for Kemujan Island had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.11 g C m(-2) for the aboveground stock in the range of 0-28.70 g C m(-2), and for Labuan Bajo, the RMSE of the map was 9.73 g C m(-2), with aboveground stock range of 0.31-64.38 g C m(-2). Model cross-validation revealed that the mapping model can be site-specific or robust depending on the characteristics of the field-derived AGC(seagrass) data used to train the regression algorithm. For example, the model developed for Labuan Bajo seagrasses, which had a higher AGC variance, can be successfully applied to Kemujan Island with its lower AGC variance, but not vice versa. This finding is a key factor in the future development of a robust AGC(seagrass) mapping model that is applicable to various seagrass meadows as a stepping stone to accelerating the filling of gaps in the global seagrass dataset.

TI  - Effects of CO2 enrichment on photosynthesis, growth, and nitrogen metabolism of the seagrass Zostera noltii
AB  - Seagrass ecosystems are expected to benefit from the global increase in CO2 in the ocean because the photosynthetic rate of these plants may be C-i-limited at the current CO2 level. As well, it is expected that lower external pH will facilitate the nitrate uptake of seagrasses if nitrate is cotransported with H+ across the membrane as in terrestrial plants. Here, we investigate the effects of CO2 enrichment on both carbon and nitrogen metabolism of the seagrass Zostera noltii in a mesocosm experiment where plants were exposed for 5 months to two experimental CO2 concentrations (360 and 700 ppm). Both the maximum photosynthetic rate (Pm) and photosynthetic efficiency (alpha) were higher (1.3- and 4.1-fold, respectively) in plants exposed to CO2-enriched conditions. On the other hand, no significant effects of CO2 enrichment on leaf growth rates were observed, probably due to nitrogen limitation as revealed by the low nitrogen content of leaves. The leaf ammonium uptake rate and glutamine synthetase activity were not significantly affected by increased CO2 concentrations. On the other hand, the leaf nitrate uptake rate of plants exposed to CO2-enriched conditions was fourfold lower than the uptake of plants exposed to current CO2 level, suggesting that in the seagrass Z. noltii nitrate is not cotransported with H+ as in terrestrial plants. In contrast, the activity of nitrate reductase was threefold higher in plant leaves grown at high-CO2 concentrations. Our results suggest that the global effects of CO2 on seagrass production may be spatially heterogeneous and depend on the specific nitrogen availability of each system. Under a CO2 increase scenario, the natural levels of nutrients will probably become limiting for Z. noltii. This potential limitation becomes more relevant because the expected positive effect of CO2 increase on nitrate uptake rate was not confirmed.

TI  - Inorganic and Black Carbon Hotspots Constrain Blue Carbon Mitigation Services Across Tropical Seagrass and Temperate Tidal Marshes
AB  - Total organic carbon (TOC) sediment stocks as a CO2 mitigation service require exclusion of allochthonous black (BC) and particulate inorganic carbon corrected for waterâ€“atmospheric equilibrium (PICeq). For the first time, we address this bias for a temperate salt marsh and a coastal tropical seagrass in BC hotspots that represent two different blue carbon ecosystems of Malaysia and Australia. Seagrass TOC stocks were similar to the salt marshes with soil depths &lt; 1Â m (59.3 Â± 11.3 and 74.9 Â± 18.9 MgC haâˆ’ 1, CI 95 % respectively). Both ecosystems showed larger BC constraints than did their pristine counterparts. However, the seagrass meadowsâ€™ mitigation services were largely constrained by both higher BC/TOC and PICeq/TOC fractions (38.0 % Â± 6.6 and 43.4 % Â± 5.9 %, CI 95 %) and salt marshes around a third (22 % Â± 10.2 and 6.0 % Â± 3.1 % CI 95 %). The results provide useful data from underrepresented regions, and, reiterates the need to consider both BC and PIC for more reliable blue carbon mitigation assessments to ensure that greenhouse gas emitters do not exceed the ecosystemsâ€™ capacity.

TI  - Social consideration for blue carbon management
AB  - Coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, seagrass beds, and salt marsh provide ecosystem services to mitigate climate change. The stored carbon is called blue carbon. To date, studies relating strategy to enhance blue carbon storage is emerging. In developing a strategy to be applied to a natural resource, it is necessary to consider how it is affected and influences its people's lives. Meanwhile, the studies related to blue carbon management's social aspects are lacking compared to technical and policy aspects. This paper aims to identify peer-reviewed documents that discuss social aspects in the context of blue carbon management. This study uses a semi-systematic review approach by reviewing relevant documents based on determined keyword search terms. This study suggests that livelihood, land tenure, local knowledge, and local capacity are essential to incorporate in blue carbon management. The strategy must enforce communities to hold a significant role in governance. Those aspects would help to increase community engagement to manage and support blue carbon management. However, more extensive practical studies are needed to apply strategies on the real subject to strengthen the theory in recent literature. Â© 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

TI  - Temporal trends of organic carbon accumulation in seagrass meadows from the northern Mexican Caribbean
AB  - Carbon sequestration in seagrass meadows mitigates the currently rising CO2 atmospheric levels, as these ecosystems are highly productive and preserve sediment organic carbon over long periods. Five Pb-210 dated sediment cores, collected from seagrass meadows dominated by Thalassia testudinum in the northern Mexican Caribbean touristic corridor Cancun-Riviera Maya, were used to establish temporal trends of organic carbon (C-org) content, burial rates and stock variation over the past 100 years. C-org contents (0.17-1.94\%) and burial rates (2.0-252 g m(-2) yr(-1)) were generally within the lower end range reported for seagrass meadow sediments worldwide. C-org stock gradually increased over the past decades, associated with increasing sediment accumulation, possibly caused by inland erosion promoted by agricultural and forestry activities and, in the recent decades, by a rapid increase of urban development due to a fast growth of the tourist industry and population, likely causing fertilization of coastal waters. Seagrass meadow sediments in the northern Mexican Caribbean coastline showed long-term C-org storage and preservation, since similar to 40 to similar to 100 years depending on the core, which emphasizes the need to protect these ecosystems against impacts of global change, and their incorporation into climate change mitigation strategies should be considered.

TI  - Iron additions reduce sulfate reduction rates and improve seagrass growth on organic-enriched carbonate sediments
AB  - Here we demonstrate, through experimental iron additions to a Mediterranean seagrass meadow, that iron plays a pivotal role in seagrass systems on carbonate sediments, directly through its role as a limiting nutrient, and indirectly by stimulating phosphorus recycling through the activity of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase and by buffering the development of reduced conditions in sediments. Iron additions were performed throughout the active root zone (30 cm depth) to two Posidonia oceanica meadows, one on organic-enriched sediments and one on organic poor sediments (Reference). Seagrass growth, nutrient incorporation and sediment biogeochemical conditions were followed for four months. Iron additions had positive effects on seagrass growth (leaf production increased with 55\%) and nutrient incorporation (increased 46-91\%) in the organic-enriched site, increasing to levels found at the Reference site. There was no effect of iron additions in the Reference seagrass meadow suggesting that iron was not the most important controlling factor at this site. The iron pools were about two times higher compared to the organic-enriched site. The main effect on the sediment biogeochemical conditions at the organic-enriched site was a suppression of sulfate reduction activity to the levels encountered at the Reference site (6.7 mmol m(-2)d(-1) vs. 4.7-5.9 mmol m(-2)d(-1)). This suggests that the sulfide stress on the seagrasses was removed and that the iron availability increased due to reduced precipitation of iron-sulfides and thus improving seagrass growth conditions in these organic-enriched sediments.

TI  - Dynamics of organic and inorganic carbon across contiguous mangrove and seagrass systems (Gazi Bay, Kenya)
AB  - We report on the water column biogeochemistry in adjacent mangrove and seagrass systems in Gazi Bay (Kenya), with a focus on assessing the sources and cycling of organic and inorganic carbon. Mangrove and seagrass-derived material was found to be the dominant organic carbon sources in the water column, and could be distinguished on the basis of their Î´13C signatures and particulate organic carbon:total suspended matter (POC/TSM) ratios. Spatially, a distinct boundary existed whereby the dominance of mangrove-derived material decreased sharply close to the interface between the mangrove forest and the dense seagrass beds. The latter is consistent with the reported export of mangrove-derived material, which is efficiently trapped in the adjacent seagrass beds. There were significant net inputs of POC and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) along the Kidogoweni salinity gradient, for which the Î´13C CPOC signatures were consistent with those of mangroves. DOC was the dominant form of organic carbon in both mangrove and seagrass beds, with DOC/POC ratios typically between 3 and 15. Dynamics of dissolved inorganic carbon in the creeks were strongly influenced by diagenetic C degradation in the intertidal mangrove areas, resulting in significant CO2 emission from the water column to the atmosphere. Although highest partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) values and areal CO2 flux rates were observed in the mangrove creeks, and the water column above the seagrass beds was in some locations a net sink of CO2, most of the ecosystems' emission Of CO2 to the atmosphere occurred in the seagrass beds adjacent to the mangrove forest. The presence of dense seagrass beds thus had a strong effect on the aquatic biogeochemistry, and resulted in trapping and further mineralization of mangrove-derived POC, intense O2 production and CO2 uptake. The adjacent seagrass beds provide a large area with conditions favorable to exchange of CO2 with the atmosphere, thereby limiting export of mangrove-derived organic and inorganic carbon toward the coastal ocean.

TI  - Blue carbon sinks in South Africa and the need for restoration to enhance carbon sequestration
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses) contribute towards climate change mitigation because they are efficient at sequestering atmospheric CO2 into long-term total ecosystem carbon stocks. Destruction or disturbance therefore reduces sink capacity and leads to significant CO2 emissions. This study reports the first national estimates of: 1) total carbon storage, 2) CO2 emissions from anthropogenic activities, 3) the potential for restoration to enhance carbon sequestration for blue carbon ecosystems in South Africa. Mangrove ecosystems have the greatest carbon storage per unit area (253â€“534 Mg C haâˆ’1), followed by salt marshes (100â€“199 Mg C haâˆ’1) and seagrasses (45â€“144 Mg C haâˆ’1). Salt marshes are the most extensive and contribute 67 % to the national carbon stock of 4000 Gg C. Since 1930, 6500 ha has been lost across all blue carbon ecosystems (26 % of the natural extent), equivalent to losing 1086 Gg C from the national carbon stock. Historic CO2 emissions were estimated at an average rate of 30,266 t CO2e yrâˆ’1. Despite losses, a total of 3998 ha could be restored to increase carbon sequestration and CO2 removals of 14,845 tCO2e.yrâˆ’1. Extractive activities have declined rapidly in recent decades, but abiotic pressures on estuarine ecosystems (flow modification, reduced water quality, and artificial breaching) have been increasing. There is an urgent need to quantify the potential impact of these pressures and include them in estuarine management and restoration plans. Blue carbon ecosystems cover a relatively small area in South Africa, but they are valued for their multiple ecosystem services that contribute towards climate change adaptation and biodiversity co-benefits. These ecosystems need to be included in national policies driving climate change response in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land-Use (AFOLU) sector, such as incorporating them into the wetland subcategory of the national GHG inventory.

TI  - Tidal Flats as a Significant Carbon Reservoir in Global Coastal Ecosystems
AB  - Tidal flats are widely distributed and provide a variety of ecosystem services. Nevertheless, the consequences of tidal flat loss and implications for services such as carbon (C) sequestration have not been assessed. In unvegetated tidal flat ecosystems, sediment is the most important carbon reservoir, similar to that of vegetated coastal wetlands (i.e., mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass). We examined the C stocks and C accumulation rate (CAR) reported from 123 locations of tidal flat around the world and compared these results with data from mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass meadows. The global average CAR of tidal flats is 129.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1), with the top-meter sediments containing on average 86.3 Mg C ha(-1). Globally, tidal flat can bury 6.8 Tg C (24.9 Tg CO2) per year and can store 0.9 Pg C (3.3 Pg CO2) in the top meter sediment. Assuming the same rate of loss tidal flats as in the past three decades and that all disturbed sediment C is remineralized, 4.8 Tg C will be lost from tidal flat sediments every year, equivalent to an emission of 17.6 Tg CO2 to the water column and atmosphere.

TI  - Contemporary reliance on bicarbonate acquisition predicts increased growth of seagrass Amphibolis antarctica in a high-CO2 world
AB  - Rising atmospheric CO2 is increasing the availability of dissolved CO2 in the ocean relative to HCO3-. Currently, many marine primary producers use HCO3- for photosynthesis, but this is energetically costly. Increasing passive CO2 uptake relative to HCO3- pathways could provide energy savings, leading to increased productivity and growth of marine plants. Inorganic-carbon-uptake mechanisms in the seagrass Amphibolis antarctica were determined using the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide (AZ) and the buffer tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (TRIS). Amphibolis antarctica seedlings were also maintained in current and forecasted CO2 concentrations to measure their physiology and growth. Photosynthesis of A. antarctica was significantly reduced by AZ and TRIS, indicating utilization of HCO3- -uptake mechanisms. When acclimated plants were switched between CO2 treatments, the photosynthetic rate was dependent on measurement conditions but not growth conditions, indicating a dynamic response to changes in dissolved CO2 concentration, rather than lasting effects of acclimation. At forecast CO2 concentrations, seedlings had a greater maximum electron transport rate (1.4-fold), photosynthesis (2.1-fold), below-ground biomass (1.7-fold) and increase in leaf number (2-fold) relative to plants in the current CO2 concentration. The greater increase in photosynthesis (measured as O-2 production) compared with the electron transport rate at forecasted CO2 concentration suggests that photosynthetic efficiency increased, possibly due to a decrease in photorespiration. Thus, it appears that the photosynthesis and growth of seagrasses reliant on energetically costly HCO3- acquisition, such as A. -antarctica, might increase at forecasted CO2 concentrations. Greater growth might enhance the future prosperity and rehabilitation of these important habitat-forming plants, which have experienced declines of global significance.

TI  - Dublin's saltmarshes contain climate-relevant carbon pools
AB  - Wetland ecosystems, particularly coastal vegetated ecosystems, play a vital role in climate mitigation and adaptation. Coastal vegetated habitats (including coastal wetlands such as seagrass meadows, saltmarshes, and mangroves) are some of the most efficient ecosystems for storing carbon on a per hectare basis, retaining organic carbon for centuries to millennia. We conducted carbon stock assessments, to a depth of 1 m, across four young saltmarsh sites and the adjacent mudflats in Dublin, Ireland. Soil cores and vegetation samples were taken across each site in order to analyze the carbon content of each carbon pool. The carbon density of Dublin's saltmarshes was 112.1 +/- 10.1 Mg C-org ha(-) (1). The dominant plant species were Spartina anglica, Plantago maritima, and Atriplex portulacoides. The soil carbon pool of these saltmarshes contributes 87\% to the total carbon stock, with living plant biomass contributing the remaining 13\%. Saltmarshes are important ecosystems for climate mitigation and can provide nature-based solutions to reduce net carbon emissions; however, their degradation will lead to the loss of climate-relevant carbon pools.

TI  - Soil Carbon and Nitrogen Storage in Natural and Prop-Scarred Thalassia Testudinum Seagrass Meadows
AB  - Seagrass meadows are carbon (C) sinks and nitrogen (N)-limited ecosystems that experience degradation from climate change and anthropogenic stressors, including prop-scarring disturbances by boating vessels. To better understand the variability in C and N pools of undisturbed seagrass soils and the recovery of these pools following boat propeller scarring, we quantified organic carbon (Corg) and N pools within the top 1 m of soils in undisturbed Thalassia testudinum seagrass beds of the Lower Laguna Madre (LLM), Texas, USAâ€”a sub-tropical, uniquely hypersaline, and heavily used recreational boating lagoonâ€”and used a chronosequence approach to compare these undisturbed soil pools to those in different aged prop scars (1â€“3, 4â€“6, 7â€“9, and 10+ years). We found that undisturbed soils stored 108.41 Â± 2.93 and 6.65 Â± 0.26 Mg (megagram) haâˆ’1 of Corg and N, respectively, in the top 1 m, with ~ 30% of these pools stored within the top 20 cm. Scarring impacted these shallow, organic-rich pools, exposing higher bulk density (BD) mineral soils with lower %Corg and %N. Consequently, young scars (1â€“3 years) had significantly lower %Corg and %N values in the top 20 cm of soil compared with undisturbed soils, but the greater BD offset these changes, leading to no differences in total Corg and N pools in the top 1 m between scarred and undisturbed soils. Scars 10+ years had similar %Corg, %N, and BD soil characteristics to undisturbed soils, producing similar Corg and N pools in both upper and lower soil horizons. These findings indicate that recovery of Corg and N pools of prop-scarred seagrass soils within T. testudinum beds of the LLM will likely recover a decade or more post-disturbance. Our findings contribute to the growing global database on seagrass C and N storage and demonstrate the rate at which seagrass meadows recover post-disturbance.

TI  - Low blue carbon storage in eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows on the Pacific Coast of Canada
AB  - Seagrass habitats provide important ecosystem services, including their ability to take up and store substantial amounts of organic carbon, known as 'blue carbon.' However, the paucity of geospatial and carbon storage information along the Pacific Coast of Canada hinders the inclusion of blue carbon storage data in conservation planning and policy development in coastal habitats. We assessed the carbon storage and accumulation rates in three eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows in southern Clayoquot Sound on the Pacific Coast of British Columbia. The intertidal and subtidal portions of each meadow were mapped and sampled to estimate eelgrass density, biomass, and carbon, and sediment cores were analyzed to estimate sediment carbon storage and accumulation rates. Aboveground biomass measurements were consistent with estimates for Z. marina in other regions, with average aboveground carbon biomass estimates of 16.78 g C m-2 and 16.25 g C m-2 in the intertidal and subtidal areas, respectively. However, the estimated aboveground to belowground biomass ratio was an order of magnitude higher than for seagrass species in temperate/tropical areas, largely because belowground biomass was up to 10 times lower than for other Z. marina meadows, averaging 6.17 g C m-2 and 5.03 g C m-2 in the intertidal and subtidal zones, respectively. Sediment carbon concentrations did not exceed 1.30%Corg, and carbon accumulation rates ranged from 2.90-39.61 g Corg m-2 yr-1, decreasing with depth and averaging 10.8Â±5.2 g Corg m-2 yr-1. While sediment carbon stocks were generally higher in the eelgrass meadows relative to non-vegetated reference sites, carbons stocks averaged 1343Â±482 g Corg m-2, substantially less than global averages. These carbon results confirm that eelgrass does contribute to carbon storage in Clayoquot Sound but at lower rates than identified for more tropical seagrasses. By improving the quantification of site-specific carbon dynamics, eelgrass' role in climate change mitigation and conservation planning can be assessed. Â© 2018 Postlethwaite et al.

TI  - Adaptation of Temperate Seagrass to Arctic Light Relies on Seasonal Acclimatization of Carbon Capture and Metabolism
AB  - Due to rising global surface temperatures, Arctic habitats are becoming thermally suitable for temperate species. Whether a temperate species can immigrate into an ice-free Arctic depends on its ability to tolerate extreme seasonal fluctuations in daylength. Thus, understanding adaptations to polar light conditions can improve the realism of models predicting poleward range expansions in response to climate change. Plant adaptations to polar light have rarely been studied and remain unknown in seagrasses. If these ecosystem engineers can migrate polewards, seagrasses will enrich biodiversity, and carbon capture potential in shallow coastal regions of the Arctic. Eelgrass (Zostera marina) is the most widely distributed seagrass in the northern hemisphere. As the only seagrass species growing as far north as 70 degrees N, it is the most likely candidate to first immigrate into an ice-free Arctic. Here, we describe seasonal (and diurnal) changes in photosynthetic characteristics, and in genome-wide gene expression patterns under strong annual fluctuations of daylength. We compared PAM measurements and RNA-seq data between two populations at the longest and shortest day of the year: (1) a Mediterranean population exposed to moderate annual fluctuations of 10-14 h daylength and (2) an Arctic population exposed to high annual fluctuations of 0-24 h daylength. Most of the gene expression specificities of the Arctic population were found in functions of the organelles (chloroplast and mitochondrion). In winter, Arctic eelgrass conserves energy by repressing respiration and reducing photosynthetic energy fluxes. Although light-reactions, and genes involved in carbon capture and carbon storage were upregulated in summer, enzymes involved in CO2 fixation and chlorophyll-synthesis were upregulated in winter, suggesting that winter metabolism relies not only on stored energy resources but also on active use of dim light conditions. Eelgrass is unable to use excessive amounts of light during summer and demonstrates a significant reduction in photosynthetic performance under long daylengths, possibly to prevent photoinhibition constrains. Our study identified key mechanisms that allow eelgrass to survive under Arctic light conditions and paves the way for experimental research to predict whether and up to which latitude eelgrass can potentially migrate polewards in response to climate change.

TI  - Does Nutrient Availability Regulate Seagrass Response to Elevated CO2?
AB  - Future increases in oceanic carbon dioxide concentrations (CO2(aq)) may provide a benefit to submerged plants by alleviating photosynthetic carbon limitation. However, other environmental factors (for example, nutrient availability) may alter how seagrasses respond to CO2(aq) by regulating the supply of additional resources required to support growth. Thus, questions remain in regard to how other factors influence CO2(aq) effects on submerged vegetation. This study factorially manipulated CO2(aq) and nutrient availability, in situ, within a subtropical seagrass bed for 350days, and examined treatment effects on leaf productivity, shoot density, above- and belowground biomass, nutrient content, carbohydrate storage, and sediment organic carbon (C-org). Clear, open-top chambers were used to replicate CO2(aq) forecasts for the year 2100, whereas nutrient availability was manipulated via sediment amendments of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer. We provide modest evidence of a CO2 effect, which increased seagrass aboveground biomass. CO2(aq) enrichment had no effect on nutrient content, carbohydrate storage, or sediment C-org content. Nutrient addition increased leaf productivity and leaf N content, however did not alter above- or belowground biomass, shoot density, carbohydrate storage, or C-org content. Treatment interactions were not significant, and thus NP availability did not influence seagrass responses to elevated CO2(aq). This study demonstrates that long-term carbon enrichment may alter the structure of shallow seagrass meadows, even in relatively nutrient-poor, oligotrophic systems.

TI  - Boosted fish abundance associated with Posidonia oceanica meadows in temperate shallow CO2 vents
AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) may induce major shifts in the structure and function of coastal marine ecosystems. Studies in volcanic CO2 vents, where seawater is naturally acidified, have reported an overall simplification of fish assemblages structure, while some primary producers are likely to increase their biomass under elevated concentration of CO2. Here we used temperate shallow CO2 vents located around the coast of Ischia island (Italy) to assess the effects of OA on necto-benthic fish assemblages associated with the foundation seagrass species Posidonia oceanica in the Mediterranean Sea. We compared P. oceanica meadow structure, its epiphytic community and the associated fish assemblage structure and diversity at vents with low pH sites and reference sites with ambient pH using underwater visual census strip transects, in two seasons (fall 2018 and summer 2019). Data were analysed using both univariate and multivariate statistical techniques. Results showed greater P. oceanica habitat complexity (i.e. shoot density) and lower abundance of epiphytic calcareous species (e.g. coralline algae) at the vents than reference sites. Total abundance of adult and juvenile fish was higher at vents than reference sites, while no differences were found for species richness and composition. Overall, the herbivore Sarpa salpa stands out among the species contributing the most to dissimilarity between vents and reference sites, showing higher abundances under OA conditions. This pattern could be explained by the combined effect of a positive response to the higher structural meadows complexity and the greater seagrasses palatability/nutritional value occurring at the vents, which may help herbivores to withstand the higher energetic cost to live under high pCO(2);low pH conditions. Our results indicate that necto-benthic fish assemblages associated with the Mediterranean P. oceanica ecosystem may cope with OA under the CO2 emission scenarios forecasted for the end of this century.

TI  - Carbon stock estimation of seagrass species thalassia hempricii using planet imagery with band ratio transformation in nirwana beach, padang city
AB  - Coastal ecosystems such as seagrass beds can store large amounts of carbon over a relatively long period of time, so a special study is needed for the seagrass ecosystem. Nirwana Beach located in Padang City presents an overview of extensive seagrass ecosystem. The carbon stock is estimated by utilizing Planet imagery with spatial resolution 3m with band ratio transformation method. Band ratio used are band ratio Green / Blue, Green / Red, and Blue / Red. Data processing is done based on correlation analysis and regression analysis between band ratio pixel value on image with value of carbon stock in field. The results show that band ratio of Green / Red has the highest r2 indicating a strong correlation relationship. The carbon stock in Nirwana Beach with total carbon 3,776,42 gC / m2 or or 3,78 kgC / m2. Accuracy test is done with standard estimate error where the highest accuracy value is obtained through the Green / Red band ratio with accuracy percent 59.98%. This research shows that the carbon stock estimation in Nirwana Beach is underestimate. Â© 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Mapping of blue carbon ecosystems: Effect of proximity, activity types and frequency of visits in the accuracy of participatory maps
AB  - Interest in blue carbon has drastically increased in recent years, particularly in improving the coastal resource carbon storage estimates and the development of methodology for identifying and monitoring such resources. In coastal resource mapping, participatory mapping techniques have the potential to provide a level of granularity and detail by taking advantage of local knowledge. In this work, we aim to evaluate the agreement between blue carbon ecosystem status obtained from participatory mapping versus the ones discriminated from satellite images, as well as assess how â€œrelative proximityâ€ to landmarks affects the accuracy. Results showed that the accuracy of mapped mangrove extents, evaluated as intersection-over-union, is positively correlated with frequency of visits. It is also found that maps generated by participants who have jobs or activities that nurture awareness about mangroves and seagrasses tend to agree better with remotely-sensed maps. The participants were even able to identify small patches of mangroves and seagrasses that are not present in the classified satellite images. While our initial work explores factors that impact the consistency between these sources, there is a need to establish a baseline for which both sources of information are evaluated against; and define relevant accuracy metrics. Our final goal is to systematically combine these two sources of information for an accurate holistic coastal resource map. Â© Authors 2019. CC BY 4.0 License.

TI  - Seasonal growth and senescence of seagrass alters sediment accumulation rates and carbon burial in a coastal lagoon
AB  - Seagrass meadows are important carbon sinks in the global coastal carbon cycle yet are also among the most rapidly declining marine habitats. Their ability to sequester carbon depends on flowâ€“sedimentâ€“vegetation interactions that facilitate net deposition, as well as high rates of primary production. However, the effects of seasonal and episodic variations in seagrass density on net sediment and carbon accumulation have not been well quantified. Understanding these dynamics provides insight into how carbon accumulation in seagrass meadows responds to disturbance events and climate change. Here, we apply a spatially resolved sediment transport model that includes coupling of seagrass effects on flow, waves, and sediment resuspension in a seagrass meadow to quantify seasonal rates of sediment and carbon accumulation in the meadow. Our results show that organic carbon accumulation rates were largely determined by sediment accumulation and that they both changed non-linearly as a function of seagrass shoot density. While seagrass meadows effectively trapped sediment at meadow edges during springâ€“summer growth seasons, during winter senescence low-density meadows (&lt; 160 shoots mâˆ’2) were erosional with rates sensitive to density. Small variations in winter densities resulted in large changes in annual sediment and carbon accumulation in the meadow; meadow-scale (hundreds of square meters) summer seagrass dieback due to marine heatwaves can result in annual erosion and carbon loss. Our findings highlight the strong temporal and spatial variability in sediment accumulation within seagrass meadows and the implications for annual sediment carbon burial rates and the resilience of seagrass carbon stocks under future climate change.

TI  - Variability in the Carbon Storage of Seagrass Habitats and Its Implications for Global Estimates of Blue Carbon Ecosystem Service
AB  - The recent focus on carbon trading has intensified interest in 'Blue Carbon'-carbon sequestered by coastal vegetated ecosystems, particularly seagrasses. Most information on seagrass carbon storage is derived from studies of a single species, Posidonia oceanica, from the Mediterranean Sea. We surveyed 17 Australian seagrass habitats to assess the variability in their sedimentary organic carbon (Corg) stocks. The habitats encompassed 10 species, in mono-specific or mixed meadows, depositional to exposed habitats and temperate to tropical habitats. There was an 18-fold difference in the Corg stock (1.09-20.14 mg Corg cm-3 for a temperate Posidonia sinuosa and a temperate, estuarine P. australis meadow, respectively). Integrated over the top 25 cm of sediment, this equated to an areal stock of 262-4833 g Corg m-2. For some species, there was an effect of water depth on the Corg stocks, with greater stocks in deeper sites; no differences were found among sub-tidal and inter-tidal habitats. The estimated carbon storage in Australian seagrass ecosystems, taking into account inter-habitat variability, was 155 Mt. At a 2014-15 fixed carbon price of A$25.40 t-1 and an estimated market price of $35 t-1 in 2020, the Corg stock in the top 25 cm of seagrass habitats has a potential value of $AUD 3.9-5.4 bill. The estimates of annual Corg accumulation by Australian seagrasses ranged from 0.093 to 6.15 Mt, with a most probable estimate of 0.93 Mt y-1 (10.1 t. km-2 y-1). These estimates, while large, were one-third of those that would be calculated if inter-habitat variability in carbon stocks were not taken into account. We conclude that there is an urgent need for more information on the variability in seagrass carbon stock and accumulation rates, and the factors driving this variability, in order to improve global estimates of seagrass Blue Carbon storage.

TI  - The Contribution of Subtidal Seagrass Meadows to the Total Carbon Stocks of Gazi Bay, Kenya
AB  - Seagrass beds occur globally in both intertidal and subtidal zones within shallow marine environments, such as bays and estuaries. These important ecosystems support fisheries production, attenuate strong wave energies, support human livelihoods and sequester large amounts of CO2 that may help mitigate the effects of climate change. At present, there is increased global interest in understanding how these ecosystems could help alleviate the challenges likely to face humanity and the environment into the future. Unlike other blue carbon ecosystems, i.e., mangroves and saltmarshes, seagrasses are less understood, especially regarding their contribution to the carbon dynamics. This is particularly true in regions with less attention and limited resources. Paucity of information is even more relevant for the subtidal meadows that are less accessible. In Kenya, much of the available information on seagrasses comes from Gazi Bay, where the focus has been on the extensive intertidal meadows. As is the case with other regions, there remains a paucity of information on subtidal meadows. This limits our understanding of the overall contribution of seagrasses in carbon capture and storage. This study provides the first assessment of the species composition and variation in carbon storage capacity of subtidal seagrass meadows within Gazi Bay. Nine seagrass species, comprising of Cymodocea rotundata, Cymodocea serrulata, Enhalus acoroides, Halodule uninervis, Halophila ovalis, Halophila stipulacea, Syringodium isoetifolium, Thalassia hemprichii, and Thalassodendron ciliatum, were found. Organic carbon stocks varied between species and pools, with the mean below ground vegetation carbon (bgc) stocks (5.1 +/- 0.7 Mg C ha(-1)) being more than three times greater than above ground carbon (agc) stocks (0.5 +/- 0.1 Mg C ha(-1)). Mean sediment organic carbon stock (sed C-org) of the subtidal seagrass beds was 113 +/- 8 Mg C ha(-1). Combining this new knowledge with existing data from the intertidal and mangrove fringed areas, we estimate the total seagrass ecosystem organic carbon stocks in the bay to be 196,721 Mg C, with the intertidal seagrasses storing about 119,790 Mg C (61\%), followed by the subtidal seagrasses 55,742 Mg C (28\%) and seagrasses in the mangrove fringed creeks storing 21,189 Mg C (11\%). These findings are important in highlighting the need to protect subtidal seagrass meadows and for building a national and global data base on seagrass contribution to global carbon dynamics.

TI  - Increasing salinization and organic carbon burial rates in seagrass meadows from an anthropogenically-modified coastal lagoon in southern Gulf of Mexico
AB  - Intertidal ecosystems, such as marshes, mangroves, and seagrasses, contribute to the global carbon storage, helping to regulate atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Organic carbon (Corg) data from seagrass meadows in the Mexican coastline are still scarce, preventing appropriate evaluations of its contribution to mitigate global climate change. Recent temporal changes (â‰¤100 years) of Corg concentrations and burial rates were assessed in 210Pb dated cores from seagrass meadows at Terminos Lagoon, the largest coastal lagoon in the southern Gulf of Mexico. Irrespective of the predominant seagrass species, the cores showed comparable Corg concentrations (0.04â€“3.9%) and burial rates (2.5 â€“ 66.7 g mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1). Increasing salinization, likely caused by sea level rise, favoured Corg concentrations and burial rates in sediments with Halodule wrightii, while in sediments with Thalassia testudinum only Corg burial rates increased, owing to increasing mass accumulation rates, likely promoted by erosion induced by land use changes, and sea level rise. The mean Corg stock (1 m depth; 130 Â± 29 Mg haâˆ’1) was comparable with the global average Corg stock for seagrasses in other tropical areas around the world. Our results suggested that, under the current scenario of land use change and marine transgression, the seagrass meadows in Terminos Lagoon preserve the capacity for Corg accumulation and long-term preservation. However, both factors are also known to reduce seagrass resilience caused by water quality deterioration, thus these ecosystems must be monitored and protected from global change impacts, as part of climate change mitigation efforts.

TI  - Use of a wastewater recovery product (struvite) to enhance subtropical seagrass restoration
AB  - Seagrasses are in decline worldwide, and their restoration is relatively expensive and unsuccessful compared to other coastal systems. Fertilization can improve seagrass growth in restoration but can also release nutrients and pollute the surrounding ecosystem. A slow-release fertilizer may reduce excessive nutrient discharge while still providing resources to the seagrass's rhizosphere. In this study, struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate), a relatively insoluble, sustainable compound harvested in wastewater treatment plants, was compared to Osmocote (TM) (14:14:14 Nitrogen: Phosphorus: Potassium, N:P:K), a popular polymer coated controlled release fertilizer commonly used in seagrass restoration. Two experiments compared the effectiveness of both fertilizers in a subtropical flow-through mesocosm setup. In the first experiment, single 0.5 mg of P per g dry weight (DW) doses of Osmocote (TM) and struvite fertilizers were added to seagrass plots. Seagrass shoot counts were significantly higher in plots fertilized with struvite than both the Osmocote (TM) and unfertilized controls (p < 0.0001). A significant difference in total P concentration was observed in porewater samples of Osmocote (TM) vs struvite and controls (p < 0.0001), with struvite fertilized plots emitting more than controls (p <= 0.0001), but less than 2\% of the total dissolved P (TDP) of Osmocote (TM) fertilized plots (100 + mg/L versus x > 5 mg/L). A subsequent experiment, using smaller doses (0.01 and 0.025 mg of P per gram DW added), also found that the struvite treatments performed better than Osmocote (TM), with 16-114\% more above ground biomass (10-60\% higher total biomass) while releasing less N and P. These results indicate the relatively rapid dissolution of Osmocote (TM) may pose problems to restoration efforts, especially in concentrated doses and possibly leading to seagrass stress. In contrast, struvite may function as a slow-release fertilizer applicable in seagrass and other coastal restoration efforts.

TI  - Carbon stock and Î´ 13 C data of sediment samples collected from a tropical seagrass meadow in Malaysia
AB  - Seagrass ecosystems are considered as major blue carbon sinks, thus contributing directly to the mitigation of climate change by storing carbon in their habitats. However, empirical data for carbon stocks in Malaysia seagrass meadow sediment remain unreported in a standardised format. This paper presents data on organic (OC) and inorganic carbon (IC) stocks, and stable isotope signatures of carbon (Î´ 13 C) in bulk seagrass sediments collected from Sungai Pulai estuary (Johor, Malaysia). Within this estuary, seagrasses form shoals at Tanjung Adang and Merambong. Organic carbon and Î´ 13 C values in bulk sediment were analysed by an elemental analyser and a continuous flow isotope-ratio mass spectrometer, respectively, while sediment IC data was derived from loss-on-ignition calculations of sample mass differences. The data from these samples are presented as downcore profile of OC (values range at 0.14% to 2.49%), IC (0.16% to 5.29%), Î´ 13 C values of organic matter (- 27.9 to -20.4), and cumulative carbon stocks (1.03-3.39 kg OC m -2 and 0.76-2.84 kg IC m -2 ) in the top 30 cm of sediments. This dataset is applicable for regional and local blue carbon studies, which would allow insights into carbon sink and carbon cycling capacity, in addition to gaining insights into the provenances of carbon stored in seagrass meadows.

TI  - Heterotrophic Bacteria Respond Differently to Increasing Temperature and Dissolved Organic Carbon Sources in Two Tropical Coastal Systems
AB  - Temperature and substrate availability are important variables controlling marine heterotrophic bacterial activity. However, particularly in tropical regions it remains to be determined how these variables jointly affect bacterial activity. In this study we show how bacterial carbon cycling in two tropical coastal ecosystems (the Great Barrier Reef [GBR, Australia] and the Red Sea [Saudi Arabia]) are influenced by changing temperature (using a 6Â°C gradient) and the addition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from different sources (addition of mangroves and seagrass leachates, plus natural seawater). Our study demonstrates that elevated temperatures in the GBR increased bacterial organic carbon processing, while in the Red Sea no clear effects were found. More of the added DOC was degraded in the Red Sea but this additional carbon did not increase the biomass production, due to low bacterial growth efficiencies in all treatments. In addition, increasing temperatures in the GBR resulted in lower bacterial growth efficiencies, while no clear impact were found in the Red Sea. In conclusion, this study suggests that site-specific ecosystem differences (e.g., different microbial and macrophyte community composition) may override general responses to temperature and substrate in tropical coastal waters.

TI  - Inorganic carbon utilization in marine angiosperms (seagrasses)
AB  - The mechanisms by which marine angiosperms, or seagrasses, utilize external inorganic carbon (Ci) include, in addition to uptake of CO2 formed spontaneously from HCO3-: (i) extracellular carbonic anhydrase-mediated conversion of HCO3- to CO2 at normal seawater pH, or in acid zones created by H+ extrusion, and (ii) H+-driven utilization (direct uptake?) of HCO3-. The latter mechanism was recently indicated for Zostera marina, Halophila stipulacea and Ruppia maritima, and manifested itself as a sensitivity of photosynthesis to buffers, as well as a relative insensitivity to acetazolamide under buffer-free conditions, especially at high pH. Seagrasses have until recently been viewed as having Ci utilization systems that are less `efficient' than macroalgae, and this has, for example, led to the thought that future rises in atmospheric and thus dissolved CO2 would have a stronger effect on seagrasses than on macroalgae. However, most of the experiments leading to such conclusions were carried out in the laboratory on detached leaves, and buffers were used to keep HCO3-/CO2 ratios stable during Ci additions. The revelation that seagrass photosynthesis is sensitive to buffers as well as to physical perturbations, has led to new experiments in which initial pH values are set by appropriate HCO3-/CO32- ratios, and/or O-2 measurements on leaf pieces are replaced with pulse amplitude-modulated fluorometry on whole, attached leaves, often in situ. Under such conditions, the photosynthetic responses of seagrasses to Ci match those obtained for macroalgae. Thus, the paradigm of `inefficient' Ci utilization by seagrasses as compared with macroalgae may no longer be valid. Consequently, it seems that the generally observed high productivity of seagrass beds may have its background in very efficient, H+-driven, means of HCO3- utilization.

TI  - Application of solidified sea bottom sediments into environmental bioremediation materials
AB  - Since dredged sea bottom sediments normally give off a horrible smell, the limitation of disposal places has become a serious problem in Japan. Hence, development of an alternative system to readily treat dredged sea bottom sediments is therefore needed. The development of ``value-added'' reused products from these sediments offers particular benefits both in terms of resource recovery and protection of the environment. We developed an in situ solidification system for the treatment of sea bottom sediments, the ``Hi-Biah-System (HBS)''. Firstly, this review deals with solidified sea bottom sediments for the construction of an artificial tidal flat in Ago Bay, Japan. The environmental conditions (pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), acid volatile sulphide (AVS), loss on ignition (LOI), water content (WC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (T-N), chlorophyll a and particle size) were then monitored in the constructed tidal flat. The number of benthos individuals and growth of short-necked clams (Ruditapes philippinarum) in the artificial tidal flat were also evaluated. The environmental conditions, number of benthos individuals and growth of short-necked clams in the artificial tidal flat were shown to be similar to those observed in a natural tidal flat. Next, the potential use of solidified sea bottom sediments as soil parent material in the germination/growth of seagrass is presented. The soil parent material consisting of solidified sediments obtained using HBS plus soil conditioner and hardener seems to be effective for the germination of Zostera marina. The best growth after six months was observed in plants grown in soil parent material consisting of a mixture of solidified sediments and the sand by weight ration 70:30. The present study may suggest the possible application of solidified sea bottom sediments into growth of other plants.

TI  - Export from Seagrass Meadows Contributes to Marine Carbon Sequestration
AB  - Seagrasses export a substantial portion of their primary production, both in particulate and dissolved organic form, but the fate of this export production remains unaccounted for in terms of seagrass carbon sequestration. Here we review available evidence on the fate of seagrass carbon export to conclude that this represents a significant contribution to carbon sequestration, both in sediments outside seagrass meadows and in the deep sea. The evidence presented implies that the contribution of seagrass meadows to carbon sequestration has been underestimated by only including carbon burial within seagrass sediments.

TI  - Assessment of energy flows and system attributes of seagrass bed in Yellow River estuary wetland
AB  - Seagrass ecosystems form the foundation of one of the most important coastal wetlands, whereas their habitat quality is declining due to the climate change and multiple anthropogenic pressures. Understanding the pelagic-benthic coupling in energy flows is essential to the protection and restoration of seagrass beds. Stable isotope analysis (mostly S13C and 5!>N) constitutes a radical improvement to analyze diets, which is now widely used to trace the pathways of energy flows and determine the contributions of different diet sources to the ingestion of consumers. In this paper, we conducted the field sampling of the carbon sources and consumer trophic groups of the seagrass bed in the Yellow River estuary wetland in July 2017. In total, we divided all organisms into 15 trophic groups, comprising detritus (suspended particular matter), phytoplankton, epilithic algal matrix, seagrass, Spartina alternijlora, zooplankton, gastropods, bivalves, crabs, polychaetes, shrimps, Planiliza haematocheila, Cynoglossus semilaevis, Synechogobius hasta, and Lateolabrax japonicus. We then detected the stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (SI3C and 5I5N) of all trophic groups. The trophic positions of consumer trophic groups were estimated based on the 5I5N values. We obtained the potential diet sources for each consumer trophic group based on the published diet data using gut content analysis or isotope signatures in other seagrass beds or closing to our study area. We ran the Bayesian mixing isotope model ( SIAH package in R ) each time for each consumer trophic group to quantify its diet composition, and then calculated its pelagic and benthic contributions. The results showed that the SI3C and 5,5N values of carbon sources and consumer trophic groups in the seagrass bed all showed significant differences (P<0.05). The S13C value of pelagic carbon source ( phytoplankton) was significantly lower than that of benthic carbon sources (-22.26%c and-12.34 %o, respectively). The trophic positions of consumer trophic groups ranged from 1.49 ( zooplankton) to 4.20 ( Lateolabrax japonicus). Zooplankton relied on pelagic pathway and gastropods relied on the benthic pathway, whereas other consumer trophic groups relied both on the two pathways. Moreover, we found that the S,3C values of consumer trophic groups decreased significantly with the increasing pelagic contribution, otherwise increased significantly with the increasing benthic contribution (Adj/? =0.49, P = 0.015) , which is consistent with the distinction of 5 C values between pelagic and benthic carbon sources. The quantitative analysis of the seagrass bed in terms of trophic structure and its pelagic-benthic coupling can help us to gain insight on the trophic transferring characteristics and thereby provide a more systematic perspective on the ecological protection and restoration of seagrass beds.

TI  - Blue carbon fluxes and inventories in mangroves associated with an anthropized coastal lagoon [Flujos e inventarios de carbono azul en manglares asociados a una laguna costera antropizada]
AB  - Mangroves, along with seagrasses and saltmarshes, are among the coastal ecosystems known as blue carbon ecosystems. These ecosystems are natural carbon sinks, relevant to mitigate global warming because they are able to sequester significant amounts of CO2 for biomass production, and to store organic matter in sediments for a very long time. We present the temporal evaluation of fluxes (g mâˆ’2 yearâˆ’1) and inventories (Mg haâˆ’1) of organic carbon (Corg) from sediment cores collected in mangroves areas associated with the coastal lagoon Estero de UrÃ­as, in MazatlÃ¡n, Sinaloa. The work strategy included the geochemical characterization of sediments by elemental composition analysis through X-ray fluorescence spectrometry to evaluate changes in sediment origin (terrestrial or marine); the determination of the grain size distribution to evaluate changes in the hydrodynamics of the study sites; and the quantification of Corg concentrations with an elemental analyzer. Finally, we estimated the economic cost of the impacts of CO2 emissions caused by the oxidation of Corg due to potential perturbations of the study sites. This information is an additional component of the economic benefits of the preservation of mangrove ecosystems, relevant in coastal wetland management plans, since mangrove conservation contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and could be used as part of an ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change strategy in tropical and subtropical zones around the world.

TI  - Photosynthetic utilisation of inorganic carbon by seagrasses from Zanzibar, East Africa
AB  - Photosynthetic rates of eight seagrass species from Zanzibar were limited by the inorganic carbon composition of natural seawater (2.1 mM, mostly in the form of HCO3), and they exhibited more than three time higher rates at inorganic carbon saturation (&gt;6 mM). The intertidal species that grew most shallowly, Halophila ovalis, Halodule wrightii and Cymodacea rotundata, showed the highest affinity for inorganic carbon (K(1/2) &gt; cm. 2.5 mM), followed by the subtidal species (K(1/2) &gt; 5 mM). Photosynthesis of H. wrightii, C. rotundata. Cymodocea serrulata and Enhalus acoroides was &gt;50% inhibited by acetazolamide, a membrane-impermeable inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, indicating that extracellular HCO3 dehydration is an important part of their inorganic carbon uptake. Photosynthetic rates of H. wrightii. Thalassia hemprichii, Thalassodendron ciliatum, C. serrulata and E. acoroides were strongly reduced by changing the seawater pH from 8.2 to 8.6 in a closed system. In H. ovalis, C. rotundata and Syringodium isoetifolium, photosynthesis at pH 8.6 was maintained at a higher level than could be caused by the ca. 30% CO2 concentration which remained in the closed experimental systems at that pH, pointing toward HCO3 uptake in those species. It is suggested that the ability of H. ovalis and C. rotundata to grow in the high, frequently air-exposed, intertidal zone may be related to a capability to take up HCO3 directly, since this is a more efficient way of HCO3 utilisation than extracellular HCO3 dehydration under such conditions. The inability of all species to attain maximal photosynthetic rates under natural conditions of inorganic carbon supports the notion that seagrasses may respond favourably to any future increases in marine CO2 levels.

TI  - Temperature Effects on Leaf and Epiphyte Photosynthesis, Bicarbonate Use and Diel O-2 Budgets of the Seagrass Zostera marina L.
AB  - Ocean warming along with nutrient enrichment are major stressors causing global seagrass decline. While the effects of global warming on metabolic parameters in seagrasses are well described, the effect of increasing temperature on the epiphytic overgrowth of seagrass leaves and the consequences for the seagrass plant are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of elevating temperature on the photosynthetic efficiency of the seagrass species Zostera marina L. and its associated epiphytes, to explore how ocean warming might affect epiphytism in seagrasses. Gas exchange and final pH measurements on bare seagrass leaves, leaves with epiphytes, and epiphytes separated from seagrass leaves were used to quantify photosynthesis and respiration rates, and the inorganic carbon extraction capacity of leaves and epiphytes as a function of photon scalar irradiance and temperature (12, 17, 22, and 27 degrees C). Seagrass without epiphytic biofilm had a high ability to exploit the incoming irradiance regardless of the light intensity and temperature, shown as continuously high light use efficiency and maximum net photosynthesis rates. The presence of epiphytic biofilm on the seagrass leaves impaired plant photosynthesis by increasing light requirements and reducing the photosynthetic efficiency (especially at 27 degrees C). Epiphytes showed the lowest respiration rates in darkness and had the highest oxygen surplus over diel cycles up to 22 degrees C, whereas bare leaves had the highest diel oxygen surplus at 27 degrees C. Both bare leaves and epiphytes lost the ability to utilize bicarbonate at 27 degrees C, and epiphytes also did not show use of bicarbonate at 12 degrees C. Our results indicate a competitive advantage for epiphytes in cold CO2-rich environments, whereas seagrass with bare leaves could be less affected under elevated seawater temperatures.

TI  - Contribution of mangroves to coastal carbon cycling in low latitude seas
AB  - The contribution of mangrove carbon to the coastal ocean in low latitudes was evaluated. Mangrove forests occupy only 2\% of the world's coastal ocean area yet they account for about 5\% of net primary production, 12\% of ecosystem respiration and about 30\% of carbon burial on all continental margins in subtropical and tropical seas. Mangroves also account for nearly one-third of all riverine DIC discharging into low latitude coastal waters. Mangrove forests fix, release and sequester more carbon by area than all other coastal ecosystem types, except perhaps for subtropical and tropical seagrass meadows for which data are lacking. Globally, mangrove waters release to the atmosphere more than 2.5 times (-42.8 Tg Cy-1) the amount of CO2 emitted from all other subtropical and tropical coastal waters. The global destruction of the large carbon stocks (956 Mg C ha(-1)) of mangroves at the current annual rate of about 1\% results in an additional annual release of roughly 133 Tg C y(-1) to the atmosphere. Mangroves account for only 0.7\% of tropical forest area globally, but their destruction currently adds another 10\% to global CO2 release from tropical deforestation. Despite considerable uncertainty upscaling small numbers of measurements with large coefficents of variation, our calculations suggest that mangroves are a globally significant contributor to the carbon cycle in low latitude seas, and to greenhouse emissions resulting from tropical deforestation.

TI  - Importance of seagrass as a carbon source for heterotrophic bacteria in a subtropical estuary (Florida Bay)
AB  - A stable carbon isotope approach was taken to identify potential organic matter sources incorporated into biomass by the heterotrophic bacterial community of Florida Bay. a subtropical estuary with a recent history of seagrass loss and phytoplankton blooms. To gain a more complete understanding of bacterial carbon cycling in seagrass estuaries, this study focused on the importance of seagrass-derived organic matter to pelagic, seagrass epiphytic, and sediment surface bacteria. Particulate organic matter (POM), seagrass epiphytic, seagrass (Thalassia testudinum) leaf, and sediment surface samples were collected from four Florida Bay locations with historically different organic matter inputs, macrophyte densities, and primary productivities. Bulk (observed and those reported previously) and compound-specific bacterial fatty acid delta C-13 values were used to determine important carbon sources to the estuary and benthic and pelagic heterotrophic bacteria. The delta C-13 values of T testudinum green leaves with epiphytes removed ranged from -9.9 to -6.9 parts per thousand. Thalassia testudinum delta C-13 values were significant more enriched in C-13 than POM, epiphytic, and sediment samples, which ranged from -16.4 to -13.5, -16.2 to -9.6, and -16.7 to -11.0 parts per thousand, respectively. Bacterial fatty acid delta C-13 values (measured for br14:0, 15:0, 05:0, a15:0, br17:0, and 17:0) ranged from -25.5 to -8.2 parts per thousand. Assuming a -3 parts per thousand carbon source fractionation from fatty acid to whole bacteria, pelagic, epiphytic, and sediment bacterial delta C-13 Values were generally more depleted in C-13 than T testudinum delta C-13 values, more enriched in C-13 than reported delta C-13 values for mangroves, and similar to reported delta C-13 values for algae. Isosource mixing model results indicated that organic matter derived from T testudinum was incorporated by both benthic and pelagic bacterial communities, where 13-67\% of bacterial delta C-13 values could arise from consumption of seagrass-derived organic matter. The IsoSource model, however, failed to discriminate clearly the fraction of algal (0-86\%) and mangrove (0-42\%) organic matter incorporated by bacterial communities. These results indicate that pelagic, epiphytic, and sediment surface bacteria consumed organic matter from a variety of sources. Bacterial communities incorporated consistently seagrass-derived organic matter, the dominant macrophyte in Florida Bay, but seagrass delta C-13 values alone could not account fully for bacterial delta C-13 values.

TI  - Loss of `Blue Carbon' from Coastal Salt Marshes Following Habitat Disturbance
AB  - Increased recognition of the global importance of salt marshes as `blue carbon' (C) sinks has led to concern that salt marshes could release large amounts of stored C into the atmosphere (as CO2) if they continue undergoing disturbance, thereby accelerating climate change. Empirical evidence of C release following salt marsh habitat loss due to disturbance is rare, yet such information is essential for inclusion of salt marshes in greenhouse gas emission reduction and offset schemes. Here we investigated the stability of salt marsh (Spartina alterniflora) sediment C levels following seagrass (Thallasia testudinum) wrack accumulation; a form of disturbance common throughout the world that removes large areas of plant biomass in salt marshes. At our study site (St Joseph Bay, Florida, USA), we recorded 296 patches (7.5 +/- 2.3 m(2) mean area +/- SE) of vegetation loss (aged 3-12 months) in a salt marsh meadow the size of a soccer field (7 275 m(2)). Within these disturbed patches, levels of organic C in the subsurface zone (1-5 cm depth) were similar to 30\% lower than the surrounding undisturbed meadow. Subsequent analyses showed that the decline in subsurface C levels in disturbed patches was due to loss of below-ground plant (salt marsh) biomass, which otherwise forms the main component of the long-term `refractory' C stock. We conclude that disturbance to salt marsh habitat due to wrack accumulation can cause significant release of below-ground C; which could shift salt marshes from C sinks to C sources, depending on the intensity and scale of disturbance. This mechanism of C release is likely to increase in the future due to sea level rise; which could increase wrack production due to increasing storminess, and will facilitate delivery of wrack into salt marsh zones due to higher and more frequent inundation.

TI  - Estimation of soil carbon storage under mono-specific Enhalus acoroides meadows in Pari Island, Indonesia
AB  - Large seagrass meadows in Indonesia are predicted to have a significant ability in capturing and storing carbon and are useful to mitigate global climate change. However, most of the available data are derived from short-term carbon storage of living biomass, whereas data on long-term carbon storage in the soil is still limited. This study, therefore, aims to measure soil carbon storage in mono-specific Enhalus acoroides meadows in Pari Island. A total of nine soil cores was collected in a 100 100 m2 area. The parameters were soil depth, dry bulk density (DBD), and Corg content. We applied a PVC corer with 7.4 cm in diameter and 80 cm in length to collect the soil. The length of the soil core varied between 8 and 67 cm. The mean ( SE) of soil dry bulk density is 0.98 0.04 gr/cm3 and the median is 1.1 gr/cm3, while Corg content is 2.1 0.1% soil DW (mean SE) and 1.9% (median). E. acoroides vegetation in Pari Island stores around 63 Mg Corg/ha organic carbon in 8-67cm or 34cm (mean depth) of topsoil. Carbon storage of these mono-specific meadows is comparable to soil carbon storage in the seagrass ecosystems per hectare areas on national, regional, and global levels.

TI  - Organic carbon sequestration and storage in vegetated coastal habitats along the western coast of the Arabian Gulf
AB  - Certain coastal ecosystems such as mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass habitats have been identified as significant natural carbon sinks, through the sequestration and storage of carbon in their biomass and sediments, collectively known as 'blue carbon' ecosystems. These ecosystems can often thrive in extreme environments where terrestrial systems otherwise survive at the limit of their existence, such as in arid and desert regions of the globe. To further our understanding of the capability of blue carbon ecosystems to sequester and store carbon in such extreme climates, we measured carbon sediment stocks in 25 sites along the Western Arabian Gulf coast. While seagrass meadows and saltmarsh habitats were widely distributed along the coast, mangrove stands were much reduced as a result of anthropogenic pressures, with 90% of stands having been lost over the last century. Carbon stocks in 1 m deep surface sediments were similar across all three blue carbon habitats, with comparable stocks for saltmarsh (81 Â± 22 Mg Corg haâˆ’1), seagrass (76 Â± 20 Mg Corg haâˆ’1) and mangroves (76 Â± 23 Mg Corg haâˆ’1). We recorded a 38% decrease in carbon stocks between mature established mangrove stands (91 Mg Corg haâˆ’1) and recently planted mangroves (56 Mg Corg haâˆ’1). Mangroves also had the lowest carbon stock per total area owing to their very limited spatial coverage along the coast. The largest stock per total area belonged to seagrass beds as a result of their large spatial coverage within the Gulf. We employed210Pb dating to determine the sediment accretion rates in each ecosystem and found mangrove habitats to be the most efficient carbon sequesters over the past century, with the highest carbon burial rate of the three ecosystems (19 g Corg mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1), followed by seagrass (9 g Corg mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1) and saltmarshes (8 g Corg mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1). In this work, we describe a comprehensive comparison of sediment stocks in different blue carbon ecosystems within a single marine environment and across a large geographical area, and discuss our results in a global context for other blue carbon ecosystems in the dry tropics.

TI  - The blue carbon wealth of nations
AB  - Carbon sequestration and storage in mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass meadows is an essential coastal `blue carbon' ecosystem service for climate change mitigation. Here we offer a comprehensive, global and spatially explicit economic assessment of carbon sequestration and storage in three coastal ecosystem types at the global and national levels. We propose a new approach based on the country-specific social cost of carbon that allows us to calculate each country's contribution to, and redistribution of, global blue carbon wealth. Globally, coastal ecosystems contribute a mean +/- s.e.m. of US\$190.67 +/- 30 bn yr(-1) to blue carbon wealth. The three countries generating the largest positive net blue wealth contribution for other countries are Australia, Indonesia and Cuba, with Australia alone generating a positive net benefit of US\$22.8 +/- 3.8 bn yr(-)(1) for the rest of the world through coastal ecosystem carbon sequestration and storage in its territory. Blue carbon ecosystems take up and store substantial amounts of carbon. This represents an important ecosystem service in the context of climate change, with coastal ecosystems contributing nearly US\$200 bn yr(-)(1) to blue carbon wealth.

TI  - Estimating carbon emission and baseline for blue carbon ecosystems in indonesia
AB  - There is a good chance for Indonesia, the largest archipelagic state in the world, to contribute to climate change mitigation effort by optimizing the 'regulating and maintenance' ecosystem service in the form of 'blue carbon' function provided by mangrove and seagrass. These so called 'blue carbon' ecosystems have 3-5 times capacity of storing and sequestering carbon compared to terrestrial vegetation. This paper attempts to provide the estimation of baseline or Business as Usual (BAU) scenario for blue carbon ecosystems which would be required if formal emission inventory of 'blue carbon' ecosystems is to be implemented. The result shows mangrove degradation occurs both during base years of 2000 - 2016 and during the projected emission period of 2017 - 2030. Mangrove conversion to aquaculture pond is the main cause of degradation, contributing up to 72.50 % of the total carbon emission. Blue carbon climate change mitigation by mangrove rehabilitation can only reduce up to 6 % of carbon emission from baseline in 2030. Significant emission reduction of 73,38% from BAU emission in 2030 can only be achieved through integration of mangrove rehabilitation, silvofishery practice and the prevention of mangrove conversion to other land-uses.

TI  - Two temperate seagrass meadows are negligible sources of methane and nitrous oxide
AB  - Seagrasses are globally important ecosystems that can help mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon (C). The net impact seagrass meadows have on the climate, however, also depends on methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes. By not accounting for CH4 and N2O fluxes, we may be overestimating or underestimating the true C sequestration capacity of seagrasses. Yet, few observations of seagrass CH4 and N2O fluxes are available. Here, we quantified summer, dark/light CH4 and N2O fluxes across the sediment-water interface from seagrass meadows (Zostera marina) and adjacent nonvegetated sediments in two temperate bays with different environmental characteristics. On two occasions, we also estimated system wide air-sea CH4 and N2O fluxes. We found the CH4 fluxes across the sediment-water interface varied between the two sites with one site emitting CH4 from vegetated sediments and a net zero flux at the other site. N2O fluxes across the sediment-water interface were not different from zero regardless of seagrass presence, although when we did measure a flux, there was more often a net uptake of N2O. We estimated that both systems were small net sources of CH4 and N2O to the atmosphere; however, the sediments are not likely the source of CH4 and N2O emitted to the atmosphere in the systems. Although the diffusive fluxes measured here are lower than those reported in the literature, they are consistent with our current understanding of seagrass sediments being variable sources of CH4 and potentially a negligible source or sink of N2O.

TI  - Trace element bias in the use of CO2 vents as analogues for low pH environments: Implications for contamination levels in acidified oceans
AB  - Research into the effects of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems has increasingly focused on natural CO2 vents, although their intrinsic environmental complexity means observations from these areas may not relate exclusively to pH gradients. In order to assess trace element levels and distribution in the Levante Bay (Vulcano Island, NE Sicily, Italy) and its suitability for studying biological effects of pH decline, Ba, Fe and trace elements (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, V and Zn) in sediment were analysed from 7 transects. Where present, Cymodocea nodosa leaves and epiphytes were also analysed. At the spatial scale of the bay, trace element concentrations in sediments and biota showed wide variability, possibly related to both input from fluid emissions and seawater physico-chemical variables (i.e. pH and Eh), which may considerably affect the solubility and bioavailability of potentially harmful trace elements. According to two pollution indices (MSPI: Marine Sediment Pollution Index and SQG-Q: Sediment Quality Guideline Quotient), the bay can be considered to be affected by low contamination with moderate potential for adverse biological effects, especially in the area between about 150 and 350 m from the primary vent, where localized detrimental effects on biota may occur. Generally, biological samples showed concentrations that were comparable with the lower values of seagrass ranges. The overall results of this study support the complex spatial dynamics of trace elements in the CO2 vent studied, which are constrained by both direct input from the vent and/or biogeochemical processes affecting element precipitation at the sediment-seawater interface. Consequently, great caution should be used when relating biological changes along pH gradients to the unifactorial effect of pH only, as interactions with concurrent, multiple stressors, including trace element enrichments, may occur. This finding has implications for the use of CO2 vents as analogues in ocean acidification research. They should be considered more appropriately as analogues for low pH environments with non-negligible trace element contamination which, in a scenario of continuous increase in anthropogenic pollution, may be very common.

TI  - Detritus dynamics in the seagrass Posidonia oceanica: Elements for an ecosystem carbon and nutrient budget
AB  - Leaf decay, leaf litter export, burial in belowground sinks, and respiratory consumption of detritus were examined at 2 different depths in a Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile meadow off the Medes Islands, NW Mediterranean. At 5 m, the amount el exported leaf litter represented carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus losses of 7, 9 and 6% of the plant primary production, respectively. About 26% of the carbon produced by the plant in 1 yr was immobilized by burial in the belowground compartment, i.e. as roots and rhizomes. Annual nitrogen and phosphorus burial in the sediment was 8 and 5% of total N and P needs, respectively. Respiratory consumption (aerobic) of carbon leaf detritus represented 17% of the annual production. An additional, but very substantial, loss of carbon as very fine particulate organic matter has been estimated at ca 48%. At 13 m the pattern of carbon losses was similar, but the lesser effect of wave action (relative to that at 5 m) reduced exportation, hence increasing the role of respiratory consumption. Data on carbon losses indicated that only a small part of the plant production was actually available to fuel the food web of this ecosystem. Total nutrient losses were in the range of 21 to 47% of annual needs. From differences found in N and P concentrations between living and dead tissues, it is suggested that important nutrient recycling (50 to 70%) may be due either to reclamation or to leaching immediately after plant death.

TI  - Light Is More Important Than Nutrient Ratios of Fertilization for Cymodocea nodosa Seedling Development
AB  - Restoration of seagrass beds through seedlings is an alternative to the transplantation of adult plants that reduces the impact over donor areas and increases the genetic variability of restored meadows. To improve the use of Cymodocea nodosa seedlings, obtained from seeds germinated in vitro, in restoration programs, we investigated the ammonium and phosphate uptake rates of seedlings, and the synergistic effects of light levels (20 and 200 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)) and different nitrogen to phosphorus molar ratios (40 mu M N:10 mu M P, 25 mu M N:25 mu M P, and 10 mu N:40 mu M P) on the photosynthetic activity and growth of seedlings. The nutrient content of seedlings was also compared to the seed nutrient reserves to assess the relative importance of external nutrient uptake for seedling development. Eighty two percent of the seeds germinated after 48 days at a mean rate of 1.5 seeds per day. All seedlings under all treatments survived and grew during the 4 weeks of the experiment. Seedlings of C. nodosa acquired ammonium and phosphate from the incubation media while still attached to the seed, at rates of about twice of adult plants. The relevance of external nutrient uptake was further highlighted by the observation that seedlings' tissues were richer in nitrogen and phosphorus than non-germinated seeds. The uptake of ammonium followed saturation kinetics with a half saturation constant of 32 mu M whereas the uptake of phosphate increased linearly with nutrient concentration within the range tested (5 - 100 mu M). Light was more important than the nutrient ratio of fertilization for the successful development of the young seedlings. The seedlings' photosynthetic and growth rates were about 20\% higher in the high light treatment, whereas different nitrogen to phosphorus ratios did not significantly affect growth. The photosynthetic responses of the seedlings to changes in the light level and their capacity to use external nutrient sources showed that seedlings of C. nodosa have the ability to rapidly acclimate to the surrounding light and nutrient environment while still attached to the seeds. C. nodosa seedlings experiencing fertilization under low light levels showed slightly enhanced growth if nourished with a balanced formulation, whereas a slight increase in growth was also observed with unbalanced formulations under a higher light level. Our results highlight the importance of high light availability at the seedling restoration sites.

TI  - Net Drawdown of Greenhouse Gases (CO2, CH4 and N2O) by a Temperate Australian Seagrass Meadow
AB  - Seagrasses have some of the highest rates of carbon burial on the planet and have therefore been highlighted as ecosystems for nature-based climate change mitigation. However, information is still needed on the net radiative forcing benefit of seagrasses inclusive of their associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Here, we report simultaneous estimates of seagrass-associated carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) air-water emissions. Applying in situ sampling within a south-east Australian seagrass ecosystem, this study finds atmospheric GHG emissions from waters above seagrasses to range from - 480 +/- 15.96 to - 16.2 +/- 8.32 mg CO2-equivalents m(2) d(-1) (net uptake), with large temporal and spatial variability. Using a combination of gas specific mass balance equations, dissolved stable carbon isotope values (delta C-13) and in situ time-series data, CO2-e flux is estimated at - 21.74 mg m(2) d(-1). We find that the net release of CH4 (0.44 mu mol m(2) h(-1)) and net uptake of N2O (- 0.06 mu mol m(2) h(-1)) effectively negated each other at 16.12 and - 16.13 mg CO2-e m(2) d(-1), respectively. The results of this study indicate that temperate Australian seagrasses may function as net sinks of atmospheric CO2-e. These results contribute towards filling key emission accounting gaps both in the Australian region, and through the simultaneous measurement of the three key greenhouse gas species.

TI  - Seagrass Species Composition and Above-Ground Carbon Stock Mapping in Parang Island using PlanetScope Image
AB  - Seagrass beds with various species are widespread in Indonesia, where one of them is on Parang Island. The important role of seagrasses as a store of carbon stocks that prevent an increase in earth temperature makes the seagrass species composition and carbon stocks on Parang Island need to be inventoried and known for their existence. Seagrass data, especially on Parang Island, is not yet available, so an inventory and mapping are needed. PlanetScope image is one image that is expected to be able to map biophysical information on seagrass beds. The objectives of this study are (1) to map the composition of seagrass species and (2) to map the seagrass above-ground carbon stock (AGC) and estimate the total seagrass AGC stored on Parang Island, Karimunjawa Islands using PlanetScope. The composition of seagrass species was obtained through multispectral classification (maximum likelihood, random forest, support vector machine) and AGC seagrass through empirical modeling. The class composition of seagrass species obtained was Cymodocea rotundata (Cr), Enhalus acoroides (Ea), Thalassia hemprichii (Th), and EaThCr, with the accuracy of 32.16\%. Seagrass AGC empirical modeling has an R2 0.086. The DII23 water column corrected band has the highest accuracy for seagrass AGC mapping, which is 66.90\% with a Standard Error of Estimate (SE) value of 4.78 gC/m(2). The total estimated AGC of seagrass found on Parang Island is 50.15 t C.

TI  - A low-cost benthic incubation chamber for in-situ community metabolism measurements
AB  - Benthic incubation chambers facilitate in-situ metabolism studies in shallow water environments. They are used to isolate the water surrounding a study organism or community so that changes in water chemistry can be quantified to characterise physiological processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification. Such field measurements capture the biological processes taking place within the benthic community while incorporating the influence of environmental variables that are often difficult to recreate in ex-situ settings. Variations in benthic chamber designs have evolved for a range of applications. In this study, we built upon previous designs to create a novel chamber, which is (1) low-cost and assembled without specialised equipment, (2) easily reproducible, (3) minimally invasive, (4) adaptable to varied substrates, and (5) comparable with other available designs in performance. We tested the design in the laboratory and field and found that it achieved the outlined objectives. Using non-specialised materials, we were able to construct the chamber at a low cost (under (sic)20 USD per unit), while maintaining similar performance and reproducibility with that of existing designs. Laboratory and field tests demonstrated minimal leakage (2.08 +/- 0.78\% water exchange over 4 h) and acceptable light transmission (86.9 +/- 1.9\%), results comparable to those reported for other chambers. In the field, chambers were deployed in a shallow coastal environment in Akumal, Mexico, to measure productivity of seagrass, and coral-, algae-, and sand-dominated reef patches. In both case studies, production rates aligned with those of comparable benthic chamber deployments in the literature and followed established trends with light, the primary driver of benthic metabolism, indicating robust performance under field conditions. We demonstrate that our low-cost benthic chamber design uses locally accessible and minimal resources, is adaptable for a variety of field settings, and can be used to collect reliable and repeatable benthic metabolism data. This chamber has the potential to broaden accessibility and applications of in-situ incubations for future studies.

TI  - Drivers of CO2 along a mangrove-seagrass transect in a tropical bay: Delayed groundwater seepage and seagrass uptake
AB  - Water-to-air carbon dioxide fluxes from tropical coastal waters are an important but understudied component of the marine carbon budget. Here, we investigate drivers of carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) in a relatively pristine mangrove-seagrass embayment on a tropical island (Bali, Indonesia). Observations were performed over eight underway seasonal surveys and a fixed location time series for 55 h. There was a large spatial variability of pCO2 across the continuum of mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and the coastal ocean. Overall, the embayment waters surrounded by mangroves released CO2 to the atmosphere with a net flux rate of 18.1 Â± 5.8 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1. Seagrass beds produced an overall CO2 net flux rate of 2.5 Â± 3.4 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1, although 2 out of 8 surveys revealed a sink of CO2 in the seagrass area. The mouth of the bay where coral calcification occurs was a minor source of CO2 (0.3 Â± 0.4 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1). The overall average CO2 flux to the atmosphere along the transect was 9.8 Â± 6.0 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1, or 3.6 Ã— 103 mol dâˆ’1 CO2 when upscaled to the entire embayment area. There were no clear seasonal patterns in contrast to better studied temperate systems. pCO2 significantly correlated with antecedent rainfall and the natural groundwater tracer radon (222Rn) during each survey. We suggest that the CO2 source in the mangrove dominated upper bay was associated with delayed groundwater inputs, and a shifting CO2 source-sink in the lower bay was driven by the uptake of CO2 by seagrass and mixing with oceanic waters. This differs from modified landscapes where potential uptake of CO2 is weakened due to the degradation of seagrass beds, or emissions are increased due to drainage of coastal wetlands. Â© 2018

TI  - Factors Determining Seagrass Blue Carbon Across Bioregions and Geomorphologies
AB  - Seagrass meadows rank among the most significant organic carbon (C-org) sinks on earth. We examined the variability in seagrass soil C-org stocks and composition across Australia and identified the main drivers of variability, applying a spatially hierarchical approach that incorporates bioregions and geomorphic settings. Top 30 cm soil C-org stocks were similar across bioregions and geomorphic settings (min-max: 20-26 Mg C-org ha(-1)), but meadows formed by large species (i.e., Amphibolis spp. and Posidonia spp.) showed higher stocks (24-29 Mg C-org ha(-1)) than those formed by smaller species (e.g., Halodule, Halophila, Ruppia, Zostera, Cymodocea, and Syringodium; 12-21 Mg C-org ha(-1)). In temperate coastal meadows dominated by large species, soil C-org stocks mainly derived from seagrass C-org (72 +/- 2\%), while allochthonous C-org dominated soil C-org stocks in meadows formed by small species in temperate and tropical estuarine meadows (64 +/- 5\%). In temperate coastal meadows, soil C-org stocks were enhanced by low hydrodynamic exposure associated with high mud and seagrass C-org contents. In temperate estuarine meadows, soil C-org stocks were enhanced by high contributions of seagrass C-org, low to moderate solar radiation, and low human pressure. In tropical estuarine meadows formed by small species, large soil C-org stocks were mainly associated with low hydrodynamic energy, low rainfall, and high solar radiation. These results showcase that bioregion and geomorphic setting are not necessarily good predictors of soil C-org stocks and that site-specific estimates based on local environmental factors are needed for Blue Carbon projects and greenhouse gases accounting purposes.

TI  - Impacts of CO2 enrichment on productivity and light requirements of eelgrass
AB  - Seagrasses, although well adapted for submerged existence, are CO2-limited and photosynthetically inefficient in seawater. This leads to high light requirements for growth and survival and makes seagrasses vulnerable to light limitation. We explored the long-term impact of increased CO2 availability on light requirements, productivity, and C allocation in eelgrass (Zostera marina L.). Enrichment of seawater CO2 increased photosynthesis 3-fold, but had no longterm impact on respiration. By tripling the rate of light-saturated photosynthesis, CO2 enrichment reduced the daily period of irradiance-saturated photosynthesis (H-sat) that is required for the maintenance of positive whole-plant C balance from 7 to 2.7 h, allowing plants maintained under 4 h of H-sat to perform like plants growing in unenriched seawater with 12 h of H-sat. Eelgrass grown under 4 h of H-sat without added CO2 consumed internal C reserves as photosynthesis rates and chlorophyll levels dropped. Growth ceased after 30 d. Leaf photosynthesis, respiration, chlorophyll, and sucrose-phosphate synthase activity of CO2-enriched plants showed no acclimation to prolonged enrichment. Thus, the CO2-stimulated improvement in photosynthesis reduced light requirements in the long term, suggesting that globally increasing CO2 may enhance seagrass survival in eutrophic coastal waters, where populations have been devastated by algal proliferation and reduced water-column light transparency.

TI  - Impact of ocean carbonation on long-term regulation of light harvesting in eelgrass Zostera marina
AB  - Seagrasses account for approximately 10\% of the total carbon stored in the ocean, although photosynthesis of seagrasses is carbon-limited at present oceanic pH levels. Therefore, increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, which results in ocean acidification/carbonation, is predicted to have a positive impact on seagrass productivity. Previous studies have confirmed the positive influence of increasing CO2 on photosynthesis and survival of the temperate eelgrass Zostera marina, but the acclimation of photoprotective mechanisms in this context has not been characterized. We aimed to quantify the long-term impacts of ocean acidification on photochemical control mechanisms that promote photosynthesis while simultaneously protecting eelgrass from photodamage. Eelgrass were grown in controlled outdoor aquaria at different aqueous CO2 concentrations ranging from similar to 50 to similar to 2100 mu M from May 2013 to October 2014 and examined for differences in leaf optical properties. Even with daily and seasonal variations of temperature and light, CO2 enrichment consistently increased plant size, leaf thickness and chlorophyll use efficiency, and decreased pigment content and the package effect while maintaining similar lightharvesting efficiency. These acclimation responses suggest that a common photosynthetic sensory function, such as redox regulation, can be manipulated by COCO(2)2 availability, as well as light, and may serve to optimize photosynthetic carbon gain by seagrasses into the Anthropocene.

TI  - The need for local governance of global commons: The example of blue carbon ecosystems
AB  - To limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C, vast amounts of CO2 will have to be removed from the atmosphere via Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR). Enhancing the CO2 sequestration of ecosystems will require not just one approach but a portfolio of CDR options, including so-called nature-based approaches alongside CDR options that are perceived as more technical. Creating a CDR ``supply curve `` would however imply that all carbon removals are considered to be perfect substitutes. The various co-benefits of nature-based CDR approaches militate against this. We discuss this aspect of nature-based solutions in connection with the enhancement of blue carbon ecosystems (BCE) such as mangrove or seagrass habitats. Enhancing BCEs can indeed contribute to CO2 sequestration, but the value of their carbon storage is low compared to the overall contribution of their ecosystem services to wealth. Furthermore, their property rights are often unclear, i.e. not comprehensively defined or not enforced. Hence, payment schemes that only compensate BCE carbon sequestration could create tradeoffs at the expense of other important, often local, ecosystem services and might not result in socially optimal outcomes. Accordingly, one chance for preserving and restoring BCEs lies in the consideration of all services in potential compensation schemes for local communities. Also, local contexts, management structures, and benefit-sharing rules are crucial factors to be taken into account when setting up international payment schemes to support the use of BCEs and other nature- or ecosystem-based CDR. However, regarding these options as the only hope of achieving more CDR will very probably not bring about the desired outcome, either for climate mitigation or for ecosystem preservation. Unhalted degradation, in turn, will make matters worse due to the large amounts of stored carbon that would be released. Hence, countries committed to climate mitigation in line with the Paris targets should not hide behind vague pledges to enhance natural sinks for removing atmospheric CO2 but commit to scaling up engineered CDR.

TI  - Converting beach-cast seagrass wrack into biochar: A climate-friendly solution to a coastal problem
AB  - Excessive accumulation of plant â€˜wrackâ€™ on beaches as a result of coastal development and beach modification (e.g. groin installation) is a global problem. This study investigated the potential for converting beach-cast seagrass wrack into biochar as a â€˜climate-friendlyâ€™ disposal option for resource managers. Wrack samples from 11 seagrass species around Australia were initially screened for their biochar potential using pyrolysis techniques, and then two species â€“ Posidonia australis and Zostera muelleri â€“ underwent detailed analyses. Both species had high levels of refractory materials and high conversion efficiency (48â€“57%) of plant carbon into biochar carbon, which is comparable to high-quality terrestrial biochar products. P. australis wrack gave higher biochar yields than Z. muelleri consistent with its higher initial carbon content. According to 13C NMR, wrack predominantly comprised carbohydrates, protein, and lignin. Aryl carbon typical of pyrogenic materials dominated the spectrum of the thermally-altered organic materials. Overall, this study provides the first data on the feasibility of generating biochar from seagrass wrack, showing that biocharring offers a promising climate-friendly alternative to disposal of beach wrack in landfill by avoiding a portion of the greenhouse gas emissions that would otherwise occur if wrack was left to decompose.

TI  - Effects of elevated temperature on microbial breakdown of seagrass leaf and tea litter biomass
AB  - Seagrass ecosystems are globally-significant `blue carbon' sinks; however, there is concern that this capacity will decline if rising ocean temperatures accelerate microbial decomposition. Decomposition of plant litter is a key process in the global carbon cycle-it influences how much carbon is available for sequestration. Therefore, understanding the biogeochemistry underlying decomposition is essential to predicting the capacity of seagrass ecosystems to act as carbon sinks in the future. Here, we tracked the breakdown of standardised and natural litter of varying chemical recalcitrance (rooibos tea > seagrass leaves > green tea) combined with highly-sensitive microsensor technology to test (a) how elevated water temperatures affect short-term microbial turnover, and (b) provide novel information on how the decay dynamics of the tea litter compare to those of natural litter. We found that increased temperatures (+ 5-10 degrees C) boosted microbial activity for all substrates, exhibited as enhanced decay, oxygen consumption and sulphate reduction. Within the 1-month experiment, the green tea litter had a rapid Q10 response to the temperature increase, quickly exhausting the resources for microbes, while the response of the rooibos tea and seagrass litters became more apparent toward the end of the experiment. Our results suggest that the tea litters capture a range of decomposition traits and can be compared with natural litter using traditional exponential decay models. The enhanced temperature-driven organic matter turnover, even under anoxic conditions, highlights the vulnerability of fresh litter to microbial attack during the early stages of decay and the potential weakening of blue carbon accumulation rates under future climatic conditions.

TI  - The decomposition rate of the organic carbon content of suspended particulate matter in the tropical seagrass meadows
AB  - In terms of downward transport, suspended particulate matter (SPM) from marine or terrigenous sources is an essential contributor to the carbon cycle. Within mesoscale environments such as seagrass ecosystems, SPM flux is an essential part of the total carbon budget that is transported within the ecosystem. By assessing the total SPM transport from water column to sediment, potential carbon burial can be estimated. However, SPM may decompose or reforming aggregate during transport, so estimating the vertical flux without knowing the decomposition rate will lead to over- or underestimation of the total carbon budget. Here this paper presents the potential decomposition rate of the SPM in seagrass ecosystems in an attempt to elucidate the carbon dynamics of SPM. SPM was collected from the seagrass ecosystems located at Sikka and Sorong in Indonesia. In situ experiments using SPM traps were conducted to assess the vertical downward flux and decomposition rate of SPM. The isotopic profile of SPM was measured together with organic carbon and total nitrogen content. The results show that SPM was transported to the bottom of the seagrass ecosystem at a rate of up to (129.45Â±53.79) mg/(m2Â·h) (according to carbon). Considering the whole period of inundation of seagrass meadows, SPM downward flux reached a maximum of 3 096 mg/(m2Â·d) (according to carbon). The decomposition rate was estimated at from 5.9 Î¼g/(mgÂ·d) (according to carbon) to 26.6 Î¼g/(mgÂ·d) (according to carbon). Considering the total downward flux of SPM in the study site, the maximum decomposed SPM was estimated 39.9 mg/(m2Â·d) (according to carbon) and 82.6 mg/(m2Â·d) (according to carbon) for study site at Sorong and Sikka, respectively. The decomposed SPM can be 0.6%â€“2.7% of the total SPM flux, indicating that it is a small proportion of the total flux. The seagrass ecosystems of Sorong and Sikka SPM show an autochthonous tendency with the primary composition of marine-end materials.

TI  - Role of decomposition of mangrove and seagrass detritus in sediment carbon and nitrogen cycling in a tropical mangrove forest
AB  - The elemental composition and in situ decomposition of detritus of Rhizophora apiculata and Enhalus acoroides were studied in mangrove and seagrass bed sediments in the Bangrong mangrove, Phuket, Thailand, and compared with controlled laboratory flux incubations. At the field site detritus was buried in litter-boxes in the sediments and changes in particulate organic carbon and nitrogen in detritus and sediments were followed for up to 2 mo. In the flux incubations the sediments were amended with mangrove and seagrass leaves and rhizomes, and the exchange of oxygen, CO2, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and inorganic nitrogen was measured across the sediment-water interface for 43 d. The decomposition of seagrass leaves was rapid both in situ and in the laboratory, whereas about 40\% of the mangrove leaves remained after 43 d, and no decomposition could be detected for the seagrass rhizome detritus. There was an immediate increase in sediment oxygen uptake (SOU) in the seagrass sediments followed by an increase in CO2 production after the addition of detritus, whereas the SOU remained low in the mangrove sediments. The C:N ratios decreased in the carbon-rich mangrove leaves and seagrass rhizome detritus, but increased in the less carbon-rich seagrass leaves during the decomposition. The decrease in C:N ratio was attributed to colonization by bacteria which incorporated nitrogen from the overlying water column or from the indigenous particulate organic nitrogen pool in the sediments. The mineralised carbon from the plant detritus was recovered as CO2, whereas no accumulation or release of DOC was found. The effect of amendment with mangrove detritus on the nitrogen fluxes was minor, whereas the uptake of nitrate and release of ammonium was enhanced with the seagrass leaves. About 32 to 36 \% of the mineralised nitrogen from the seagrass leaves was released across the sediment-water interface, where it became available for primary producers or exported to adjacent ecosystems.

TI  - Stronger Together: Do Coral Reefs Enhance Seagrass Meadows ``Blue Carbon{''} Potential?
AB  - Seagrass meadows are important for carbon storage, this carbon is known as ``blue carbon{''} and represents a vital ecosystem service. Recently there has been growing interest in connectivity between ecosystems and the potential for connected ecosystems to facilitative ecosystem services. Tropical seagrass meadows are connected to coral reefs, as the reef barrier dissipates waves, which facilitates sediment accumulation and avoid erosion and export. Therefore, coral reefs might enhance the seagrass meadows capacity as a blue carbon sink. We tested this hypothesis through an assessment of blue carbon across a gradient of connected seagrass meadow and coral reef sites. We assessed attributes of seagrass meadows along a transect in addition to classifying the sites as exposed and sheltered. Classification of sites was completed through analyzing wave crest density in photographs and using granulometric evenness index. Organic carbon and organic matter were measured in sediment core samples and within seagrass living biomass (both above and below ground). Lastly, we measured changes in above and below ground traits of seagrass plants across the same sites. Gaps in the reef barrier were linked to high wave disturbance and exposed conditions, whilst barrier continuity to low wave disturbance and sheltered conditions. Organic carbon in sediments was 144 Mg ha(-1) in the most sheltered (with reef barrier) and 91 Mg ha(-1) in the most exposed (without reef barrier) meadows. Sheltered conditions also showed a redistribution of seagrass biomass to a greater quantity of roots compared to rhizomes. Whilst in exposed conditions the opposite occurred, which could be due to increased rhizome biomass have to enhanced anchorage or greater nutrient availability. This study found that coral reefs facilitate blue carbon potential in seagrass meadows indicating that coral reefs support this important ecosystem service. Also, results suggest that loss of coral reef structure due to bleaching and other stressors will likely result in a reduction of the blue carbon storage capacity of adjacent seagrass meadow. Further research should investigate how combined global and regional stresses may impact on the potential for coral reefs to buffer seagrass meadows, and how these stresses affect the functional traits of seagrass plants.

TI  - Effect of explosive shallow hydrothermal vents on Î”13C and growth performance in the seagrass Posidonia oceanica
AB  - Explosive volcanic submarine activity is expected to affect seagrass communities due to sudden and dramatic changes in the physical and chemical features of sea water and sediments, with possibly large ecosystem effects. However, seagrass response to the harsh environmental conditions that arise due to explosive volcanism is as yet unexplored as it is not easy to predict when and where an eruption will occur. Here, we investigate the uptake of hydrothermal carbon within the seagrass Posidonia oceanica by the analysis of Î”13C and growth rates in tissue laid down before and after an exceptional and massive hydrothermal gas release in the Aeolian Islands (Italy, Mediterranean Sea). Hydrothermal submarine activity was recorded by P. oceanica, which showed a large and persistent 13C-depletion in both scales and rhizomes in the site close to the eruption. Both increased CO2 availability and reduced carbon demand, as a consequence of stressful environmental conditions (e.g. light limitation due to turbidity, high temperature), combined to give much lower Î”13C signatures. Our results suggest that the explosive volcanism caused physiological stress in the seagrass, leading to a reduction in productivity, whereas slower, more diffuse release of hydrothermal CO2 is known to enhance seagrass productivity. Synthesis. We analysed the effect of a sudden and large hydrothermal event on Î”13C interannual variations and growth of the seagrass P. oceanica. Our results confirm that shallow submarine hydrothermal vents can be used as natural laboratories for exploring biological responses to acute and often extreme environmental conditions. P. oceanica can record geological events by capturing CO2 derived from vent systems, with implications for habitat management to mitigate against raising CO2 levels and ocean acidification. This leads the way to further studies to evaluate the effects of hydrothermal carbon on shallow ecosystems. Â© 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation Â© 2010 British Ecological Society.

TI  - Blue carbon in area-based coastal and marine management schemesâ€“a review
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems are diverse and highly productive coastal habitats (mangroves, seagrasses, and tidal marshes) that sequester large quantities of carbon and provide a suite of important ecosystem services (â€˜co-benefitsâ€™) for humans and the environment. These ecosystems are being threatened globally due to land-use change driven by expanding agriculture, aquaculture, coastal development, and pollution. Climatic impacts further threaten the resilience, functionality, and adaptability of blue carbon ecosystems. â€˜Marine protected areasâ€™ (MPAs) provide a statutory approach for protecting coastal and marine ecosystems, yet are unlikely to meet â€˜additionalityâ€™ requirements. Whereas other effective conservation measures (OECMs) including community-based â€˜locally managed marine areasâ€™ (LMMAs) provide opportunities to enhance blue carbon conservation and restoration efforts. LMMAs likely deliver additional sequestration, although ensuring â€˜permanenceâ€™ of carbon stocks may be more difficult to achieve. This review summarizes key approaches of blue carbon monitoring; governance systems; policy instruments; and investment pathways for conservation and restoration.

TI  - Effect of environmental factors (wave exposure and depth) and anthropogenic pressure in the C sink capacity of Posidonia oceanica meadows
AB  - Seagrass are among the most important natural carbon sinks on Earth with Posidonia oceanica (Mediterranean Sea) considered as the most relevant species. Yet, the number of direct measurements of organic carbon burial rates in P. oceanica is still scarce and the effect of local environmental factors remains largely unexplored. In addition, P. oceanica meadows are declining due to the increase in anthropogenic pressure in coastal areas during the last century. The aim of this study is to assess the recent carbon sink capacity of P. oceanica and particularly the effect of human pressure and two environmental factors, water depth and exposure to wave energy (based on a fetch index), on the carbon burial rate since 1900. We conducted an extensive survey of sediment cores in meadows distributed across a gradient of depth, fetch, and human pressure around The Balearic Islands. Sediment and carbon accumulation rates were obtained from 210Pb concentrations profiles. Top-30 centimeters carbon stocks (6.1 Â± 1.4 kg C mâˆ’2) and burial rates (26 Â± 6 g C mâˆ’2 yr1) varied up to fivefold across meadows. No significant effect of water depth in carbon burial rates was observed. Although fetch was significantly correlated with sediment mean grain size, confirming the effect of wave exposure in the patterns of sedimentation, fetch alone could not explain the differences in carbon burial rates among the meadows examined. Human pressure affected carbon burial rates, leading to increased rates since the onset of the rise in anthropogenic pressure, particularly so in sheltered meadows supporting high human pressure.

TI  - Effects of shading and simulated grazing on carbon sequestration in a tropical seagrass meadow
AB  - There is an ongoing world-wide decline of seagrass ecosystems, one of the world's most efficient carbon sink habitats. In spite of this, there is a clear lack of studies experimentally testing the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on carbon sequestration of seagrass systems. We assessed the effects of two disturbances of global concern on the carbon sink function in a five-month in situ experiment within a tropical seagrass (Thalassia hemprichii) meadow by testing the impacts of shading and simulated grazing at two levels of intensity using shading cloths and clipping of shoot tissue. We measured the effects of these disturbances on the carbon sequestration process by assessing the net community production (NCP), carbon and nitrogen content in tissue biomass, and organic matter and THAA (total hydrolysable amino acids) in the sediment down to 40 cm depth. Treatments of high-intensity shading and high-intensity clipping were similarly impacted and showed a significantly lower NCP and carbon content in the below-ground biomass compared to the seagrass control. No significant effects were seen in organic carbon, total nitrogen, C:N ratio and THAA in the sediment for the seagrass treatments. However, both clipping treatments showed different depth profiles of carbon and THAA compared to the seagrass control, with lower organic carbon and THAA content in the surface sediment. This can be explained by the clipping of shoot tissue causing a less efficient trapping of allochthonous carbon and reduced input of shredded seagrass leaves to the detritus sediment layer. In the clipping plots, erosion of the surface sediment occurred, which was also most likely caused by the removal of above-ground plant biomass. Synthesis. Our findings show that during the course of this experiment, there were no impacts on the sedimentary carbon while the high-intensity disturbances caused a clear depletion of carbon biomass and reduced the seagrass meadow's capacity to sequester carbon. From a long-term perspective, the observed effect on the carbon biomass pool in the high-intensity treatments and the sediment erosion in the clipping plots may lead to loss in sedimentary carbon. In an in-situ experiment, we assessed the effects of two disturbances of global concern on carbon sequestration in a tropical seagrass meadow. While no impacts were detected on the long-term storage of sedimentary carbon, high-intensity disturbances showed a lower NCP and a clear depletion of carbon biomass, leading to a reduction in the capacity to sequester carbon.

TI  - A multi-approach inventory of the blue carbon stocks of Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadows: Large scale application in Calvi Bay (Corsica, NW Mediterranean)
AB  - In Mediterranean, Posidonia oceanica develops a belowground complex structure (â€˜matteâ€™) able to store large amounts of carbon over thousands of years. The inventory of blue carbon stocks requires the coupling of mapping techniques and in situ sediment sampling to assess the size and the variability of these stocks. This study aims to quantify the organic (Corg) and inorganic (Cinorg) carbon stocks in the P. oceanica matte of the Calvi Bay (Corsica) using sub-bottom profiler imagery and biogeochemical analysis of sediment cores. The matte thicknesses map (average Â± SD: 2.2 m Â± 0.4 m) coupled with marine benthic habitat cartography allows to estimate matte volume at 12 473 352 m3. The cumulative stocks were assessed at 20.2â€“50.3 kg Corg mâˆ’2 and 26.6â€“58.7 kg Cinorg mâˆ’2 within the first meter of depth on matte (3632 Â± 486 cal yr BP). The data contributed to estimate the overall carbon stocks at 389 994 t Corg and 615 558 t Cinorg, offering a new insight of the heterogeneity of blue carbon stocks in seagrass meadows. Variability of carbon storage capacity of matte influenced by substrate is discussed. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Ecosystem carbon stocks across a tropical intertidal habitat mosaic of mangrove forest, seagrass meadow, mudflat and sandbar
AB  - Intertidal habitats provide numerous ecosystem services, including the sequestration and storage of carbon, a topic of great recent interest owing to land-cover transitions and climate change. Mangrove forests and seagrass meadows form a continuum of intertidal habitats, alongside unvegetated mudflats and sandbars, however, studies that consider carbon stocks across these spatially-linked, threatened ecosystems are limited world-wide. This paper presents the results of a field-based carbon stock assessment of aboveground, belowground and sediment organic carbon stock to a depth of 1m at Chek Jawa, Singapore. It is the first study of ecosystem carbon stocks of both vegetated and unvegetated intertidal habitats in the tropics. Ecosystem carbon stocks were 497Mg C ha(-1) in the mangrove forest and 138Mg C ha(-1) in the seagrass meadow. Sediment organic carbon stock dominated the total storage in both habitats, constituting 62\% and >99\% in the mangrove forest and seagrass meadow, respectively. In the adjacent mudflat and sandbars, which had no vegetative components, sediment organic carbon stock ranged from 124-143Mg C ha(-1), suggesting that unvegetated habitats have a carbon storage role on the same order of importance as seagrass meadows. This study reinforces the importance of sediment in carbon storage within the intertidal ecosystem, and demonstrates the need to consider unvegetated habitats in intertidal blue carbon' stock assessments.

TI  - Biomass and productivity of seagrasses in Africa
AB  - There is growing interest in carbon stocks and flows in seagrass ecosystems, but recent global reviews suggest a paucity of studies from Africa. This paper reviews work on seagrass productivity, biomass and sediment carbon in Africa. Most work was conducted in East Africa with a major geographical gap in West Africa. The mean above-ground, below-ground and total biomasses from all studies were 174.4, 474.6 and 514 g DW m(-2), respectively with a global range of 461-738 g DW m(-2). Mean annual production rate was 913 g DW m(-2) year(-1) (global range 816-1012 g DW m(-2) year(-1)). No studies were found giving sediment organic carbon, demonstrating a major gap in seagrass blue carbon work. Given the small numbers of relevant papers and the large geographical areas left undescribed in Africa, any conclusions remain tentative and much remains to be done on seagrass studies in Africa.

TI  - The Genome of a Southern Hemisphere Seagrass Species (Zostera muelleri)
AB  - Seagrasses are marine angiosperms that evolved from land plants but returned to the sea around 140 million years ago during the early evolution of monocotyledonous plants. They successfully adapted to abiotic stresses associated with growth in the marine environment, and today, seagrasses are distributed in coastal waters worldwide. Seagrass meadows are an important oceanic carbon sink and provide food and breeding grounds for diverse marine species. Here, we report the assembly and characterization of the Zostera muelleri genome, a southern hemisphere temperate species. Multiple genes were lost or modified in Z. muelleri compared with terrestrial or floating aquatic plants that are associated with their adaptation to life in the ocean. These include genes for hormone biosynthesis and signaling and cell wall catabolism. There is evidence of whole-genome duplication in Z. muelleri; however, an ancient pan-commelinid duplication event is absent, highlighting the early divergence of this species from the main monocot lineages.

TI  - Reviews and syntheses: Pb-210-derived sediment and carbon accumulation rates in vegetated coastal ecosystems - setting the record straight
AB  - Vegetated coastal ecosystems, including tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrass meadows, are being increasingly assessed in terms of their potential for carbon dioxide sequestration worldwide. However, there is a paucity of studies that have effectively estimated the accumulation rates of sediment organic carbon (C-org), also termed blue carbon, beyond the mere quantification of C-org stocks. Here, we discuss the use of the Pb-210 dating technique to determine the rate of C-org accumulation in these habitats. We review the most widely used Pb-210 dating models to assess their limitations in these ecosystems, often composed of heterogeneous sediments with varying inputs of organic material, that are disturbed by natural and anthropogenic processes resulting in sediment mixing and changes in sedimentation rates or erosion. Through a range of simulations, we consider the most relevant processes that impact the Pb-210 records in vegetated coastal ecosystems and evaluate how anomalies in Pb-210 specific activity profiles affect sediment and C-org accumulation rates. Our results show that the discrepancy in sediment and derived C-org accumulation rates between anomalous and ideal Pb-210 profiles is within 20\% if the process causing such anomalies is well understood. While these discrepancies might be acceptable for the determination of mean sediment and C-org accumulation rates over the last century, they may not always provide a reliable geochronology or historical reconstruction. Reliable estimates of C-org accumulation rates might be difficult at sites with slow sedimentation, intense mixing and/or that are affected by multiple sedimentary processes. Additional tracers or geochemical, ecological or historical data need to be used to validate the Pb-210-derived results. The framework provided in this study can be instrumental in reducing the uncertainties associated with estimates of C-org accumulation rates in vegetated coastal sediments.

TI  - Valuing blue carbon: Carbon sequestration benefits provided by the marine protected areas in Colombia
AB  - Marine protected areas are aimed to protect and conserve key ecosystems for the provision of a number of ecosystem services that are the basis for numerous economic activities. Among the several services that these areas provide, the capacity of sequestering (capturing and storing) organic carbon is a regulating service, provided mainly by mangroves and seagrasses, that gains importance as alternatives for mitigating global warming become a priority in the international agenda. The objective of this study is to value the services associated with the capture and storage of oceanic carbon, known as Blue Carbon, provided by a new network of marine protected areas in Colombia. We approach the monetary value associated to these services through the simulation of a hypothetical market for oceanic carbon. To do that, we construct a benefit function that considers the capacity of mangroves and seagrasses for capturing and storing blue carbon, and simulate scenarios for the variation of key variables such as the market carbon price, the discount rate, the natural rate of loss of the ecosystems, and the expectations about the post-Kyoto negotiations. The results indicate that the expected benefits associated to carbon capture and storage provided by these ecosystems are substantial but highly dependent on the expectations in terms of the negotiations surrounding the extension of the Kyoto Protocol and the dynamics of the carbon credit's demand and supply. We also find that the natural loss rate of these ecosystems does not seem to have a significant effect on the annual value of the benefits. This approach constitutes one of the first attempts to value blue carbon as one of the services provided by conservation. Â© 2015 Zarate-Barrera, Maldonado.

TI  - Coupling carbon metabolism and dissolved organic carbon fluxes in benthic and pelagic coastal communities
AB  - The knowledge of the production and carbon transference dynamics between adjacent communities is essential to gain a better understanding on the role of coastal areas in the global carbon cycle. Here, we assess the carbon metabolism (through dissolved oxygen -DO- concentration) and the net dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes for benthic (dominated by the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa, the rhizophytic green algae Caulerpa prolifera and unvegetated sediments) and pelagic plankton communities co-habiting the same shallow coastal area in Cadiz Bay, southern Spain. Both the seagrass and macroalgae meadows were highly autotrophic, but the carbon metabolism of C. prolifera community shifted seasonally from net autotrophic to net heterotrophic. Unvegetated benthic communities were slightly heterotrophic throughout the year, while plankton community was net autotrophic. This study reveals how the different components of the ecosystem (i.e. macrophyte, sediment or plankton community) may have a seasonal variability in the contribution to the NCP in shallow coastal areas. Moreover, our results suggest that pelagic communities can be essential to maintain autotrophy of coastal system during periods of low benthic productivity. Regarding DOC, benthic communities were net DOC producers, undergoing a marked seasonality with maximum net DOC production during summer. This indicated an extra carbon assimilation not usually contemplated in productivity studies, which entails an underestimation of gross production in these communities. A strong relationship between net DOC flux and net community production (NCP) was found for the three benthic communities. The plankton community was a net DOC consumer indicating a strong coupling between the benthic and pelagic compartments in the bay. When up-scaling our results to the whole bay, the NCP estimated for the benthos was 8800 +/- 3770 Tons C y(-1), and the net DOC flux was 2465 +/- 830 Tons C y(-1), which were mainly due to vegetated communities, indicating the importance of coastal vegetated benthic ones in the carbon metabolism and DOC fluxes.

TI  - Global Trends in Air-Water CO2 Exchange Over Seagrass Meadows Revealed by Atmospheric Eddy Covariance
AB  - Coastal vegetated habitats like seagrass meadows can mitigate anthropogenic carbon emissions by sequestering CO2 as ``blue carbon{'' (BC). Already, some coastal ecosystems are actively managed to enhance BC storage, with associated BC stocks included in national greenhouse gas inventories. However, the extent to which BC burial fluxes are enhanced or counteracted by other carbon fluxes, especially air-water CO2 flux (FCO2) remains poorly understood. In this study, we synthesized all available direct FCO2 measurements over seagrass meadows made using atmospheric Eddy Covariance, across a globally representative range of ecotypes. Of the four sites with seasonal data coverage, two were net CO2 sources, with average FCO2 equivalent to 44\%-115\% of the global average BC burial rate. At the remaining sites, net CO2 uptake was 101\%-888\% of average BC burial. A wavelet coherence analysis demonstrated that FCO2 was most strongly related to physical factors like temperature, wind, and tides. In particular, tidal forcing was a key driver of global-scale patterns in FCO2, likely due to a combination of lateral carbon exchange, bottom-driven turbulence, and pore-water pumping. Lastly, sea-surface drag coefficients were always greater than the prediction for the open ocean, supporting a universal enhancement of gas-transfer in shallow coastal waters. Our study points to the need for a more comprehensive approach to BC assessments, considering not only organic carbon storage, but also air-water CO2 exchange, and its complex biogeochemical and physical drivers.

TI  - Seagrass biomass and sediment carbon in conserved and disturbed seascape
AB  - Despite the Philippines having one of the widest extents and most diverse seagrasses, there are limited reports on the contribution of seagrass vegetation health to organic carbon (OC). Comparative assessments of OC between conserved and disturbed seagrass meadows in a seascape are also lacking. Conservation programs (e.g., marine protected area [MPA]) contribute to the maintenance of ecosystem health and OC storage in seagrass. However, disturbances may negate the effects of MPAs. Disturbances are often due to coastal development pressures linked to the need for industry, food production, and human settlement. Here, we assessed and compared the aboveground biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB), and OC between conserved and disturbed seagrass meadows, then, tested its correlation with vegetation and water quality variables. The study was conducted in Oyon Bay (northwest Philippines), one of the key seascape MPAs in the Philippines. The bay experienced disturbances from a coal power plant, aquaculture, and human settlements for approximately 30 years. Results showed 7Ã— higher AGB, 11Ã— higher BGB, and 1.7Ã— higher OC in conserved sites. The low biomass and OC values in the disturbed sites were correlated to poor vegetation and water quality conditions (particularly high turbidity [ÏÂ = 0.38], high phosphates [ÏÂ = âˆ’0.19], and low dissolved oxygen [ÏÂ = âˆ’0.31]). Our study showed the effectiveness of MPAs in maintaining ecosystem health and OC in seagrass, but the magnitude of disturbances lessened the benefits from MPAs. Our results have implications on the over- or under-estimation of carbon sequestration not just in Philippine seagrasses but also in most Southeast Asian countries facing similar coastal development pressures.

TI  - Effect of leaf movement on epiphytic algal biomass of seagrass leaves
AB  - We tested the hypothesis that the movement of seagrass leaves affects the accumulation and composition of algal epiphytes by comparing the standing crop and composition on tethered (T) and untethered (UT) artificial seagrass units (ASUs) over 4 and 8 wk. We also tested whether any effect of leaf movement on standing crop was dependent on the degree of water movement by repeating the experiment over 8 wk at sheltered and exposed sites. To eliminate the possibility of inter-regional differences between exposed and sheltered sites and to test for interactive effects of light availability and leaf movement on epiphyte biomass, we repeated the experiment at a single location, but at different depths, to achieve different hydrodynamic and light conditions. In the first experiment, T ASUs accumulated between 4 and 12 times the biomass of algal epiphytes on UT ASUs. Fewer species were found on UT leaves after 4 wk, but by 8 wk, there were similar numbers of species on both treatments. The degree of exposure did not influence the effect of leaf movement on epiphyte biomass, but depth did, with a significant but smaller difference between treatments at the deeper site. We conclude that leaf movement has a clear and significant potential to affect the accumulation of epiphytes on seagrass leaves and that this effect may be comparable to, if not more important than, nutrient and light limitation in some circumstances. The movement of seagrass leaves result in up to a 7-fold increase in light penetration due to reduced epiphyte standing crop. If the effect of leaf movement on epiphyte biomass is through physical erosion, then estimates of the contribution of epiphytes to carbonate production and organic loading to sediments must factor in an erosion loss term.

TI  - The Microbial Communities of Leaves and Roots Associated with Turtle Grass (Thalassia testudinum) and Manatee Grass (Syringodium filliforme) are Distinct from Seawater and Sediment Communities, but Are Similar between Species and Sampling Sites
AB  - Seagrasses are vital members of coastal systems, which provide several important ecosystem services such as improvement of water quality, shoreline protection, and serving as shelter, food, and nursery to many species, including economically important fish. They also act as a major carbon sink and supply copious amounts of oxygen to the ocean. A decline in seagrasses has been observed worldwide, partly due to climate change, direct and indirect human activities, diseases, and increased sulfide concentrations in the coastal porewaters. Several studies have shown a symbiotic relationship between seagrasses and their microbiome. For instance, the sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon cycles are important biochemical pathways that seem to be linked between the plant and its microbiome. The microbiome presumably also plays a key role in the health of the plant, for example in oxidizing phyto-toxic sulfide into non-toxic sulfate, or by providing protection for seagrasses from pathogens. Two of the most abundant seagrasses in Florida include Thalassia testudinum (turtle grass) and Syringodium filliforme (manatee grass), yet there is little data on the composition of the microbiome of these two genera. In this study, the microbial composition of the phyllosphere and rhizosphere of Thalassia testudinum and Syringodium filiforme were compared to water and sediment controls using amplicon sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The microbial composition of the leaves, roots, seawater, and sediment differ from one another, but are similar between the two species of seagrasses.

TI  - Australian vegetated coastal ecosystems as global hotspots for climate change mitigation
AB  - Policies aiming to preserve vegetated coastal ecosystems (VCE; tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrasses) to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions require national assessments of blue carbon resources. Here, we present organic carbon (C) storage in VCE across Australian climate regions and estimate potential annual CO2 emission benefits of VCE conservation and restoration. Australia contributes 5-11\% of the C stored in VCE globally (70-185 Tg C in aboveground biomass, and 1,055-1,540 Tg C in the upper 1 m of soils). Potential CO2 emissions from current VCE losses are estimated at 2.1-3.1 Tg CO2-e yr(-1), increasing annual CO2 emissions from land use change in Australia by 12-21\%. This assessment, the most comprehensive for any nation to-date, demonstrates the potential of conservation and restoration of VCE to underpin national policy development for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Estimating blue carbon sequestration under coastal management scenarios
AB  - Restoring and protecting ``blue carbon{''} ecosystems - mangrove forests, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows are actions considered for increasing global carbon sequestration. To improve understanding of which management actions produce the greatest gains in sequestration, we used a spatially explicit model to compare carbon sequestration and its economic value over a broad spatial scale (2500 km of coastline in southeastern Australia) for four management scenarios: (1) Managed Retreat, (2) Managed Retreat Plus Levee Removal, (3) Erosion of High Risk Areas, (4) Erosion of Moderate to High Risk Areas. We found that carbon sequestration from avoiding erosion-related emissions (abatement) would far exceed sequestration from coastal restoration. If erosion were limited only to the areas with highest erosion risk, sequestration in the non-eroded area exceeded emissions by 4.2 million Mg CO2 by 2100. However, losing blue carbon ecosystems in both moderate and high erosion risk areas would result in net emissions of 23.0 million Mg CO2 by 2100. The removal of levees combined with managed retreat was the strategy that sequestered the most carbon. Across all time points, removal of levees increased sequestration by only an additional 1 to 3\% compared to managed retreat alone. Compared to the baseline erosion scenario, the managed retreat scenario increased sequestration by 7.40 million Mg CO2 by 2030, 8.69 million Mg CO2 by 2050, and 16.6 million Mg CO2 by 2100. Associated economic value followed the same patterns, with large potential value loss from erosion greater than potential gains from conserving or re-storing ecosystems. This study quantifies the potential benefits of managed retreat and preventing erosion in existing blue carbon ecosystems to help meet climate change mitigation goals by reducing carbon emissions.

TI  - Radiative transfer within seagrass canopies: Impact on carbon budgets and light requirements
AB  - Seagrasses are ecologically important but extremely vulnerable to anthropogenic modifications of the coastal zone that affect light availability within these unique ecosystems. Strongly pigmented seagrass leaves can extend for more than 1 m above the substrate and biomass is distributed unevenly throughout the canopy. In this study, light attenuation in a 7 m water column that contained a seagrass canopy extending 1.5 m above the bottom was calculated by the radiative transfer model Hydrolight using the spectral absorbance of eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) leaves and a non-uniform vertical distribution of biomass. Runs were performed in clear (0.5 mg Chi a m(-3)) and turbid (3.0 mg Chi a m(3)) water columns, over sand and mud substrates, and with shoot densities ranging from 25 to 200 m(-2) using solar angles for both winter and summer solstices. The flux of photosynthetically active irradiance (E(PAR)) reaching the top of the seagrass canopy (5.5 m) was twice as high in summer compared to winter, and in clear water compared to turbid water. Sediment type (sand versus mud) had a measurable effect on E(PAR) only within the bottom third of the canopy. Light penetration within the canopy was inversely proportional to shoot density. Introduction of daylength and a sinusoidal distribution of E(PAR) throughout the day greatly increased the importance of solar elevation (season) on daily integrated production relative to water column turbidity and sediment type. Shoot-specific productivity decreased and the position of maximum shoot productivity within the canopy shallowed as shoot density increased. Positive net photosynthesis for entire shoots was possible only when plant density was lower than 100 shoots m(-2) in summer and 50 shoots m(-2) in winter; values consistent with field observations. Although very simplistic with regard to inherent optical properties of real seagrass leaves, this model was able to generate estimates of maximum sustainable shoot density that were fully testable by, and wholly consistent with, field observations.

TI  - Estimating seagrass blue carbon and policy implications: The Australian perspective
AB  - Blue carbon policy supports carbon sequestration whilst also conserving our remaining seagrass meadows. The complex biogeochemical processes within the sediment of seagrass meadows are responsible for the longevity of the stored carbon. Carbon stock and accumulation rates are controlled by the interaction of hydrodynamic, geochemical and biotic processes unique to each meadow. Carbon content (stock and flux) of a meadow must be quantified for inclusion in carbon accounting, whether for market trading or national greenhouse gas accounting. Management of seagrass blue carbon also requires estimates of additionality, leakage, permanence, conversion and emission factors.

TI  - A blueprint for blue carbon: toward an improved understanding of the role of vegetated coastal habitats in sequestering CO2
AB  - Recent research has highlighted the valuable role that coastal and marine ecosystems play in sequestering carbon dioxide (CO2). The carbon (C) sequestered in vegetated coastal ecosystems, specifically mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and salt marshes, has been termed ``blue carbon{''}. Although their global area is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than that of terrestrial forests, the contribution of vegetated coastal habitats per unit area to long-term C sequestration is much greater, in part because of their efficiency in trapping suspended matter and associated organic C during tidal inundation. Despite the value of mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and salt marshes in sequestering C, and the other goods and services they provide, these systems are being lost at critical rates and action is urgently needed to prevent further degradation and loss. Recognition of the C sequestration value of vegetated coastal ecosystems provides a strong argument for their protection and restoration; however, it is necessary to improve scientific understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control C sequestration in these ecosystems. Here, we identify key areas of uncertainty and specific actions needed to address them.

TI  - Blue carbon as a natural climate solution
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), including mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and tidal marshes, store carbon and provide co-benefits such as coastal protection and fisheries enhancement. Blue carbon sequestration has therefore been suggested as a natural climate solution. In this Review, we examine the potential for BCEs to act as carbon sinks and the opportunities to protect or restore ecosystems for this function. Globally, BCEs are calculated to store >30,000 Tg C across similar to 185 million ha, with their conservation potentially avoiding emissions of 304 (141-466) Tg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) per year. Potential BCE restoration has been estimated in the range of 0.2-3.2 million ha for tidal marshes, 8.3-25.4 million ha for seagrasses and 9-13 million ha for mangroves, which could draw down an additional 841 (621-1,064) Tg CO(2)e per year by 2030, collectively amounting to similar to 3\% of global emissions (based on 2019 and 2020 global annual fossil fuel emissions). Mangrove protection and/or restoration could provide the greatest carbon-related benefits, but better understanding of other BCEs is needed. BCE destruction is unlikely to stop fully, and not all losses can be restored. However, engineering and planning for coastal protection offer opportunities for protection and restoration, especially through valuing co-benefits. BCE prioritization is potentially a cost-effective and scalable natural climate solution, but there are still barriers to overcome before blue carbon project adoption will become widespread.

TI  - Leveraging Carbon Services of Coastal Ecosystems for Habitat Protection and Restoration
AB  - Coastal ``blue carbon,{''} (carbon sequestered in salt marsh, mangroves, and seagrasses) is a newly recognized benefit. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), with partners, has been exploring and developing new policy opportunities for coastal conservation using the climate benefits of these ecosystems. We detail NOAA's efforts (federal and international, market and non-market) to leverage blue carbon for coastal conservation including: (1) how blue carbon is or could be incorporated into U.S. federal policies (both existing and new policy activities); (2) market-based policy solutions including the development of a Verified Carbon Standard methodology for carbon credits for wetland restoration and two landscape assessments of the climate mitigation benefits of watershed-scale restoration; and (3) international efforts to build a North American community of practice for blue carbon science and policy with the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, Canada, and Mexico, and an assessment of where blue carbon can be incorporated into international policy frameworks (including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Wetlands Supplement and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)). Protecting coastal carbon leads to co-benefits including resilience to storms and erosion, and fishery benefits, thus blue carbon is a ``triple win{'' for climate mitigation, adaptation, and conservation.

TI  - Overgrazing of Seagrass by Sea Urchins Diminishes Blue Carbon Stocks
AB  - Seagrasses are among the Earth's most efficient ecosystems for sequestering carbon, but are also in global decline, risking carbon they have accumulated over geological timescales. One contributor to this global decline is seagrass overgrazing by sea urchins; however, it is unknown how this may affect stocks of ``blue carbon{''} by damaging the seagrass root systems that stabilise the carbon-rich sediments of seagrass meadows. To fill this knowledge gap, we used aerial and sonar mapping plus soil carbon measures to investigate a seagrass urchin overgrazing event in Southeast Australia and quantified the concomitant impacts on blue carbon stocks. We found that seagrass loss significantly diminished local organic carbon stocks. The decline was also rapid: areas grazed within the preceding 6 months showed a 35\% loss of blue carbon, which continued even after urchins had left the area (46\% loss after 3 years). High-resolution 3D sonar reconstructions revealed that urchin overgrazing of seagrass caused erosion of the top 30 +/- 20 cm of sediment within the 26,892 m(2) barren: the equivalent of 8100 +/- 5400 m(3) of sediment. To calculate the additional CO2 emissions from this erosion, we assumed between 50 and 90\% of the seagrass carbon stock (11.7 +/- 1.24 t C-org ha(-1) in the top 10 cm) would be remineralised, resulting in the release of between 57.8 and 104 tonnes of CO2 equivalents due to sea urchin overgrazing-induced erosion. This study adds to a growing body of evidence that seagrass loss leads to erosion and concomitant loss of blue carbon stocks.

TI  - Nitrogen dynamics within an estuarine seagrass meadow under heavy anthropogenic influence
AB  - Nitrogen is essential for seagrass productivity but excesses in nitrogen exposure contribute to declines in meadow health. This study reports baseline data of bulk nitrogen loadings and contents in surficial sediments and seagrass tissues to determine the extent of nitrogen inputs in meadows of Sungai Pulai estuary (Johor, Malaysia). The sediment contained relatively low nitrogen loadings (mean range of 91-94 g N m(-2)) with likely origins from land-based sources. At the meadow-level, Enhalus acoroides, Cymodocea serrulata and Thalassia hemprichii are the most important species as nitrogen sinks. The highest delta N-15 values of seagrass tissues were recorded for T. hemprichii (10.7 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand), which indicated an elevated capacity for internal recycling of nitrogen. The data demonstrates the provision of ecosystem services by the meadows in mitigating excess nitrogen imported into the estuary. Seagrasses health, however, needs to be at optimum levels for the effectiveness of the meadow as a nutrient sink.

TI  - Habitat characteristics provide insights of carbon storage in seagrass meadows
AB  - Seagrass meadows provide multiple ecosystem services, yet they are among the most threatened ecosystems on earth. Because of their role as carbon sinks, protection and restoration of seagrass meadows contribute to climate change mitigation. Blue Carbon strategies aim to enhance CO2 sequestration and avoid greenhouse gasses emissions through the management of coastal vegetated ecosystems, including seagrass meadows. The implementation of Blue Carbon strategies requires a good understanding of the habitat characteristics that influence Corg sequestration. Here, we review the existing knowledge on Blue Carbon research in seagrass meadows to identify the key habitat characteristics that influence Corg sequestration in seagrass meadows, those factors that threaten this function and those with unclear effects. We demonstrate that not all seagrass habitats have the same potential, identify research priorities and describe the implications of the results found for the implementation and development of efficient Blue Carbon strategies based on seagrass meadows.

TI  - Effects of nutrient load on microbial activities within a seagrass-dominated ecosystem: Implications of changes in seagrass blue carbon
AB  - Nutrient loading is a leading cause of global seagrass decline, triggering shifts from seagrass- to macroalgal-dominance. Within seagrass meadows of Xincun Bay (South China Sea), we found that nutrient loading (due to fish farming) increased sediment microbial biomass and extracellular enzyme activity associated with carbon cycling (polyphenol oxidase, invertase and cellulase), with a corresponding decrease in percent sediment organic carbon (SOC), suggesting that nutrients primed microorganism and stimulated SOC remineralization. Surpisingly, however, the relative contribution of seagrass-derived carbon to bacteria (Î´13Cbacteria) increased with nutrient loading, despite popular theory being that microbes switch to consuming macroalgae which are assumed to provide a more labile carbon source. Organic carbon sources of fungi were unaffected by nutrient loading. Overall, this study suggests that nutrient loading changes the relative contribution of seagrass and algal sources to SOC pools, boosting sediment microbial biomass and extracellular enzyme activity, thereby possibly changing seagrass blue carbon.

TI  - Is All Seagrass Habitat Equal? Seasonal, Spatial, and Interspecific Variation in Productivity Dynamics Within Mediterranean Seagrass Habitat
AB  - Seagrass meadows' ability to capture carbon through sequestering autochthonous carbon via photosynthesis means they could represent a potential nature-based solution to rising carbon emissions. In multispecies seagrass communities, and due to species introduction or predicted range shifts, it is important to know which species deliver different carbon sequestration gains to inform conservation actions. Large benthic chamber experiments (volume = 262L) assessed the seasonal and spatial variation in metabolism dynamics of the endemic and dominant Mediterranean seagrass, P. oceanica whilst small benthic chamber experiments (volume = 7L) compared the dynamics between, P. oceanica the native C. nodosa and non-native H. stipulacea. Within shallow P. oceanica edge habitat lower Net Apparent Productivity (NAP) occurs in autumn ( x over bar = 1.3, SD +/- 2.95 O-2 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) compared to summer ( x over bar = 9.9, SD +/- 2.75 O-2 mmol m(-2) d(-1) corresponding with periods of light limiting and light saturating conditions, but it remains overall autotrophic annually (2.3 C mol m(-2) yr(-1)). However, spatial heterogeneity exists, the center areas of P. oceanica were more productive (NAP x over bar =19.7, SD +/- 3.83 O-2 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) compared to edge habitat with spatial changes in productivity relating to plant surface area (96\%), shoot density (81\%), blade length (72\%) and seagrass percentage cover (64\%). Under comparative conditions in a sparse multispecies area of the meadow the species demonstrated different capacities for carbon fixation. H. stipulacea was carbon positive and P. oceanica fluctuated between positive and negative carbon balance suggesting both can maintain a balance between carbon fixation and carbon utilised for metabolic activity. In contrast the C. nodosa here would be expected to deteriorate as it was utilising carbon more than it was fixing (NAP(N) (2) ( x over bar = -0.0012, SD +/- 0.0007 O-2 mmol cm(-2) d(-1)). This study demonstrates that not all seagrass habitat is equal. If seagrass meadows are to play a part in mitigating CO2 emissions, variability in primary productivity within seagrass meadows needs to be accounted for to produce accurate total fixed carbon estimates, and subsequently autochthonous carbon sequestration estimates. This means seagrass meadow species composition and the condition of these meadows must be better understood.

TI  - Evaluating the Role of Seagrass in Cenozoic CO2 Variations
AB  - Marine seagrass angiosperms play an important role in carbon sequestration, removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and binding it as organic matter. Carbon is stored in the plants themselves, but also in the sediments both in inorganic and organic forms. The inorganic component is represented by carbonates produced by calcareous organisms living as epiphytes on seagrass leaves and rhizomes. In this paper, we find that the rate of seagrass epiphyte production (leaves and rhizomes) averages 400 g m(-2) yr(-1), as result of seagrass sampling at seven localities along the Mediterranean coasts, and related laboratory analysis. Seagrasses have appeared in the Late Cretaceous becoming a place of remarkable carbonate production and C sequestration during the whole Cenozoic era. Here, we explore the potential contribution of seagrass as C sink on the atmospheric CO2 decrease by measuring changes in seagrass extent, which is directly associated with variations in the global coastal length associated with plate tectonics. We claim that global seagrass distribution significantly affected the atmospheric composition, particularly at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, when the CO2 concentration fell to 400 ppm, i.e., the approximate value of current atmospheric CO2.

TI  - Vertical intertidal variation of organic matter stocks and patterns of sediment deposition in a mesotidal coastal wetland
AB  - Tidal coastal wetlands, common home to seagrass and salt marshes, are relevant carbon sinks due to their high capacity to accumulate and store organic carbon in their sediments. Recent studies demonstrated that the spatial variability of this organic carbon within the same wetland system can be significant. Some of the environmental drivers of this spatial variability remain understudied and the selection of the most relevant ones can be context dependent. Here we investigated the role of bed elevation, hydrodynamics, and habitat type (salt marsh and seagrass) on the organic matter (OM) net deposition-resuspension rate and superficial sedimentary stocks (top 5 cm) at the tidal wetlands of the Ria Formosa, a mesotidal coastal lagoon in South Portugal. Results showed that two vectors of spatial variation need to be considered to describe the intertidal sedimentary OM stocks: the bed elevation that imposes a decrease of the hydroperiod and thus the change of habitat from the lower seagrass Z. noltei to the upper saltmarsh S. maritimus, and the horizontal spatial variation along the secondary channels of the lagoon that imposes a decrease in the current flow velocity magnitude. The multiple linear regression analyses, using data from 40 sampling points, explained 59% of the variation of the superficial sedimentary stocks of OM in salt marshes and seagrasses of the Ria Formosa lagoon and revealed that stocks generally decrease with elevation, yet with variation among sites and habitats. It was also found that the decrease of the OM net deposition-resuspension rate with bed elevation was exponential. Our study emphasizes the importance of considering multiple environmental drivers and spatial variation for regional estimations of organic matter (and organic carbon) sedimentary stocks in coastal wetlands.

TI  - Contribution of Posidonia oceanica meadows in the context of climate change mitigation in the Mediterranean Sea
AB  - Coastal marine vegetation has been recently highlighted for its highly efficient carbon storage capacity. Among the sixty-four species of seagrass, Posidonia oceanica, a Mediterranean endemic species, appears to be the most effective in carbon fixation and storage. Based on new data from the study of one of the largest P. oceanica meadows in the Mediterranean Sea (100 km of coastline, 20 425 ha), and a synthesis of available data from the whole of the Mediterranean basin, the aim of this work is to evaluate the amount of carbon fixed each year by P. oceanica and sequestered in the matte, in relation with the mitigation of the impact of climate change (carbon sink). The mean total carbon fixation (blades, sheaths and rhizomes) per year varies between 33.5 and 426.6 g C.mâˆ’2 and the mean carbon sequestration (long-term sink in the matte), corresponding to the sheath and rhizome tissues, varies between 7.7 and 84.4 g C.mâˆ’2, with a clear decreasing trend according to depth because of the meadow density decrease. The synthesis of a hundred measurements made throughout the Mediterranean Sea and at depths between 0.5 and 32.0 m provides a basis for estimating the average annual carbon fixation and sequestration rate throughout the Mediterranean basin. The fixation of the blades is estimated at 1 024 t C.haâˆ’1.yrâˆ’1, that of the sheaths at 220 t C haâˆ’1.yrâˆ’1 and that of the rhizomes at 58 t C haâˆ’1.yrâˆ’1; i.e. a total fixation rate of 1 302 t C haâˆ’1.yrâˆ’1 and sequestration rate (dead sheaths and rhizomes) of 278 t C haâˆ’1.yrâˆ’1. This annual carbon fixation represents only 0.61% on average of CO2 emissions/releases for all Mediterranean countries but in the large Mediterranean islands this fixation is on average 3.1% and can reach almost 14.4% for Corsica. Moreover, the major advantage of the P. oceanica meadow lies in its capacity to store carbon from annual carbon sequestration for centuries to millennia and can be compared to several terrestrial ecosystems considered to be efficient in carbon storage (peatlands).

TI  - Predators help protect carbon stocks in blue carbon ecosystems
AB  - Predators continue to be harvested unsustainably throughout most of the Earth's ecosystems. Recent research demonstrates that the functional loss of predators could have far-reaching consequences on carbon cycling and, by implication, our ability to ameliorate climate change impacts. Yet the influence of predators on carbon accumulation and preservation in vegetated coastal habitats (that is, salt marshes, seagrass meadows and mangroves) is poorly understood, despite these being some of the Earth's most vulnerable and carbon-rich ecosystems. Here we discuss potential pathways by which trophic downgrading affects carbon capture, accumulation and preservation in vegetated coastal habitats. We identify an urgent need for further research on the influence of predators on carbon cycling in vegetated coastal habitats, and ultimately the role that these systems play in climate change mitigation. There is, however, sufficient evidence to suggest that intact predator populations are critical to maintaining or growing reserves of `blue carbon' (carbon stored in coastal or marine ecosystems), and policy and management need to be improved to reflect these realities.

TI  - Seagrass community metabolism: Assessing the carbon sink capacity of seagrass meadows
AB  - The metabolic rates of seagrass communities were synthesized on the basis of a data set on seagrass community metabolism containing 403 individual estimates derived from a total of 155 different sites. Gross primary production (GPP) rates (mean +/- SE = 224.9 +/- 11.1 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) tended to be significantly higher than the corresponding respiration (R) rates (mean +/- SE = 187.6 +/- 10.1 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1)), indicating that seagrass meadows tend to be autotrophic ecosystems, reflected in a positive mean net community production (NCP 27.2 +/- 5.8 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) and a mean P/R ratio above 1 (1.55 +/- 0.13). Tropical seagrass meadows tended to support higher metabolic rates and somewhat lower NCP than temperate ones. The P/R ratio tended to increase with increasing GPP, exceeding, on average, the value of 1 indicative of metabolic balance for communities supporting a GPP greater than 186 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1), on average. The global NCP of seagrass meadows ranged (95\% confidence limits of mean values) from 20.73 to 50.69 Tg C yr(-1) considering a low global seagrass area of 300,000 km(2) and 41.47 to 101.39 Tg C yr(-1) when a high estimate of global seagrass area of 600,000 km(2) was considered. The global loss of 29\% of the seagrass area represents, therefore, a major loss of intense natural carbon sinks in the biosphere.

AB  - Seagrass beds are major blue carbon ecosystems. Climate change-associated factors may change the seagrass community and affect the capacity of carbon sequestration. To explore the possible effects of warming, higher precipitation levels and/or sea level rise on seagrasses, the spatial and seasonal dynamics in shallow seagrass beds comprising the late-successional seagrass Thalassia hemprichii and the early-successional seagrass Halodule uninervis were tracked. The high-resolution mapping of seagrass biomass dynamics showed that T. hemprichii was the dominant species in the study sites year round, as the space occupation by the larger seagrass T. hemprichii was more efficient than that by the smaller seagrass H. uninervis. The space occupation by both species in the low-elevation site was more efficient than in the high-elevation site. In the low-elevation site, while the dominance of the faster growing seagrass H. uninervis was increasing, the dominance of T. hemprichii was decreasing. This suggested that the carbon sequestration capacity of the seagrass beds will decrease, as T. hemprichii was capable of storing more carbon in the sediments. In the high-elevation site, however, the distribution of both species was distinct and showed a clear seasonal succession. The dominance of H. uninervis moved to shallower water in the wet season and then moved back to deeper water in the dry season. Our observations suggested that four possible mechanisms might be involved in the dominance shift in the shallow seagrass beds: (1) the deeper water in the low-elevation site or the higher precipitation levels in the wet season might reduce the drought stress of H. uninervis at low tide and enhance the competition of H. uninervis over T. hemprichii; (2) the growth of H. uninervis might be stimulated more by the flushing of land-based nutrients caused by the higher precipitation rates in the wet season; (3) in the high-elevation site, the faster flow velocity and frequently disturbed sediments in the dry season might constrain the further expansion of H. uninervis to shallower water; (4) the faster flow velocity in the high-elevation site might reduce the impacts of periphyton overgrowth on T. hemprichii and maintain the dominance of T. hemprichii in the community. Our results suggest seagrasses will not necessarily respond to fluctuating environments in the same way in the coming decades.

TI  - Inorganic carbon sources for seagrass photosynthesis: An experimental evaluation of bicarbonate use in species inhabiting temperate waters
AB  - Photosynthetic inorganic carbon utilization by the seagrasses Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile, Cymodocea nodosa (Ucria) Aschers., Zostera marina (L.) and Phyllospadix torreyi S. Watson was studied by manipulating the concentrations of aqueous dissolved CO2 and HCO3- in seawater. At constant dissolved inorganic concentration (ca. 2.2 mM), photosynthetic rates were higher at low pH (i.e. 6-7; [CO2] = 1.2-0.21 mM) than at "normal" pH (i.e. 8.2; [CO2] = 0.016 mM) in all four species. Photosynthetic rates of all four species exhibited saturation kinetics in response to [HCO3-] at constant, low [CO2] (0.016 mM), with saturating [HCO3-] between 1 and 1.5 mM; this demonstrates, as it is known for other seagrass species, a clear capacity to use HCO3- as inorganic carbon source for photosynthesis. Photosynthetic rates at saturating [HCO-3] were 1.6 to 6 times lower than rates measured at high (âˆ¼ 1 mM) [CO2]. Thus, photosynthesis of these species was limited by dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) availability in normal seawater. No significant differences were found among species in their affinity for HCO3- as determined by the half-saturation constant Ks. [CO2(aq)] enhancement of photosynthesis was lower in the Mediterranean species (P. oceanica and C. nodosa) than the Pacific ones (Z. marina and P. torreyi); in addition, P. oceanica showed the highest HCO3--driven photosynthesis at saturating HCO3- concentration. These species-specific differences in inorganic carbon uptake kinetics should be considered in any inter-specific analysis of plant features depending on carbon balance, e.g. the deep distribution limit or the sensitivity to future changes in [CO2(aq)]. However, CO2 limitation of seagrass photosynthesis appears to be a common physiological feature of seagrasses that may have significant ecological and evolutionary implications.Â© 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Sediment biogeochemistry in an East African mangrove forest (Gazi Bay, Kenya)
AB  - The biogeochemistry of mangrove sediments was investigated in several mangrove forest communities in Gazi Bay, a coastal lagoon in Kenya, Africa. Carbon dioxide fluxes, sediment median grain sizes, sedimentary organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus contents and pore-water characteristics (ammonium, nitrate, sulfate and chloride) could be related to forest type. Mangrove sediments have pH values that range from 3.5 to 8.3 due to the limited buffer capacity of these sediments and intense acidifying processes such as aerobic degradation of organic matter, oxidation of reduced components, ammonium uptake by roots and root respiration. The mangrove sediments are nitrogen-rich compared to mangrove litter, as a result of microbial nitrogen retention, uptake and fixation, and import of nitrogen-rich material. It appears that mangrove sediments in Gazi Bay act as a nutrient and carbon sink rather than as a source for adjacent seagrass and reef ecosystems.

TI  - Carbon Storage in Seagrass Beds of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates
AB  - â€œBlue Carbonâ€ initiatives have highlighted the significant role of seagrasses in organic carbon (Corg) burial and sequestration. However, global databases on the extent of Corg stocks in seagrass ecosystems are largely comprised of studies conducted in monospecific beds from a limited number of regions, thus potentially biasing global estimates. To better characterize carbon stocks in seagrass beds of varying structure and composition, and to further expand the current â€œBlue Carbonâ€ database to under-represented regions, we evaluate the extent of Corg stocks in the relatively undocumented seagrass meadows of the Arabian Gulf. Surveys were conducted along the coast of Abu Dhabi (UAE) and encompassed sites ranging from sheltered embayments to offshore islands. Seagrass beds consisted of Halodule uninervis, Halophila ovalis and Halophila stipulacea. While seagrasses were widely distributed along the coast, both living and soil Corg stores were relatively modest on an areal basis. Total seagrass biomass ranged from 0.03 to 1.13Â Mg C haâˆ’1, with a mean of 0.4 Â± 0.1 (Â±SEM), and soil Corg stocks (as estimated over the top meter) ranged from 1.9 to 109Â Mg C haâˆ’1, with a mean of 49.1 Â± 7.0 (Â±SEM). However, owing to the expansive distribution of seagrasses in the Arabian Gulf, seagrass â€œBlue Carbonâ€ stocks were large, with 400 Gg C stored in living seagrass biomass and 49.1 Tg C stored in soils. Thus, despite low Corg stores for any given location, the overall contribution of seagrass beds to carbon storage are relatively large given their extensive coverage. This research adds to a growing global dataset on carbon stocks and further demonstrates that even seagrass beds dominated by small-bodied species function to store carbon in coastal environments.

TI  - Current and future carbon stocks in coastal wetlands within the Great Barrier Reef catchments
AB  - Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR) catchments include some of the world's most intact coastal wetlands comprising diverse mangrove, seagrass and tidal marsh ecosystems. Although these ecosystems are highly efficient at storing carbon in marine sediments, their soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and the potential changes resulting from climate impacts, including sea level rise are not well understood. For the first time, we estimated SOC stocks and their drivers within the range of coastal wetlands of GBR catchments using boosted regression trees (i.e. a machine learning approach and ensemble method for modelling the relationship between response and explanatory variables) and identified the potential changes in future stocks due to sea level rise. We found levels of SOC stocks of mangrove and seagrass meadows have different drivers, with climatic variables such as temperature, rainfall and solar radiation, showing significant contributions in accounting for variation in SOC stocks in mangroves. In contrast, soil type accounted for most of the variability in seagrass meadows. Total SOC stock in the GBR catchments, including mangroves, seagrass meadows and tidal marshes, is approximately 137 Tg C, which represents 9\%-13\% of Australia's total SOC stock while encompassing only 4\%-6\% of the total extent of Australian coastal wetlands. In a global context, this could represent 0.5\%-1.4\% of global SOC stock. Our study suggests that landward migration due to projected sea level rise has the potential to enhance carbon accumulation with total carbon gains between 0.16 and 0.46 Tg C and provides an opportunity for future restoration to enhance blue carbon.

TI  - Geomorphic gradients in shallow seagrass carbon stocks
AB  - Seagrass meadows are important sinks of organic carbon (C-org), in particular the near-surface C(org \& nbsp;)pool (<= 15 cm) compared to deeper sediments. Near-surface carbon is highly susceptible to disturbance and loss to the atmosphere, however, inadequate accounting for variability in this pool of carbon limits their uptake into carbon accounting frameworks. We therefore investigated the spatial variability in seagrass near-surface C-org and biomass C-org across different geomorphic (estuary, lagoonal and reef-associated) and community typologies (pioneer and persistent). Near-surface C-org stock in vegetated areas (25.78 Mg C-org ha(-1) +/- 26.64) was twice that from unvegetated areas (14.27 Mg C-org ha(-1) +/- 15.86), reinforcing the paradigm that the presence of seagrass enhances carbon stocks. Lagoonal and reef-associated meadows showed similar C-org stocks (p > 0.05), which were substantially higher (p < 0.05) than estuary meadows. Likewise, persistent seagrass communities (Cymo-docea dominance) stored higher (p < 0.05) stocks of C-org than pioneer communities (Halophila and Halodule dominance). Linear regression models showed significant but weak relationships between seagrass cover, shoot density and standing biomass with near-surface C-org stocks, whereas significant and strong relationships were observed for organic matter, dry bulk density and median grain size. The results highlight the need for higher resolution carbon assessments to better understand local and regional variability, in order to better inform carbon accounting and conservation policy.

TI  - Effects of Epiphytic Biofilm Activity on the Photosynthetic Activity, pH and Inorganic Carbon Microenvironment of Seagrass Leaves (Zostera marina L.)
AB  - Epiphytic biofilms on seagrass leaves can lead to extreme microenvironmental conditions for the encapsulated leaf limiting both its photosynthesis and respiration. Yet, little is known about how the biological activity of the biofilm itself changes the seagrass phyllosphere microenvironment and dynamics. We used microsensors to measure O-2 concentrations and pH gradients and calculate fluxes of O-2, CO2 and bicarbonate ( HC O 3 - ) around seagrass leaves (Z. marina L.) covered with artificial, inactive biofilms and natural epiphytic biofilms. A sterilized seawater-agar matrix was used to make an artificial ``inactive `` biofilm on seagrass leaves with the same thickness as the natural leaf epiphytic biofilm, which impeded turbulent exchange of gases but did not have microbial activity. We compared the concentration profiles and fluxes of O-2 and inorganic carbon of the ``active `` and ``inactive `` biofilm to investigate the effect of microbial activity and molecular diffusion in seagrass leaf biofilms. In light, the O-2 flux of leaves with inactive biofilm was only 31\% of the leaves with active biofilm, indicating that the photosynthesis of the microbial community in the biofilm makes up the majority of O-2 production in the leaf microenvironment. During darkness, the O-2 concentration profiles and O-2 fluxes were almost identical in the ``active `` and ``inactive `` biofilms. The pH profiles showed the same trend with an increase in pH of similar to 1.0 in the ``active `` biofilms and similar to 0.3 pH units in the ``inactive `` biofilms in the light, and both showing a decrease of similar to 0.3 pH units in darkness compared to the bulk seawater. Our measurements thus demonstrate strong photosynthesis in the epiphyte layer driving phyllosphere basification and inorganic carbon limitation. The calculated CO2 concentration on the leaf surface decreased to 0.09 mu mol L-1 in the epiphytic biofilm in the light compared to leaf surface CO2 concentrations of 13.8 mu mol L-1 on bare seagrass leaves, and the CO2 influxes were only 3.0\% and 5.4\% of O-2 effluxes for leaves with ``active `` and ``inactive `` biofilm, respectively. Calculations also showed that HCO3- influxes in light accounted for 91-97\% of the total inorganic carbon influx to the seagrass leaf, although the HCO3- utilization via CO2 concentration mechanisms is energy-consuming. Besides increasing mass transfer impedance, leaf epiphytic biofilm activity thus strongly affects the seagrass leaf microenvironment in the light by inducing higher O-2 concentration and pH, increasing CO2 limitation and reducing the leaf photosynthetic efficiency.

TI  - Warming enhances carbon dioxide and methane fluxes from Red Sea seagrass (Halophila stipulacea) sediments
AB  - Seagrass meadows are autotrophic ecosystems acting as carbon sinks, but they have also been shown to be sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Seagrasses can be negatively affected by increasing seawater temperatures, but the effects of warming on CO2 and CH4 fluxes in seagrass meadows have not yet been reported. Here, we examine the effect of two disturbances on air-seawater fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in Red Sea Halophila stipulacea communities compared to adjacent unvegetated sediments using cavity ring-down spectroscopy. We first characterized CO2 and CH4 fluxes in vegetated and adjacent unvegetated sediments, and then experimentally examined their response, along with that of the carbon (C) isotopic signature of CO2 and CH4, to gradual warming from 25 degrees C (winter seawater temperature) to 37 degrees C, 2 degrees C above current maximum temperature. In addition, we assessed the response to prolonged darkness, thereby providing insights into the possible role of suppressing plant photosynthesis in supporting CO2 and CH4 fluxes. We detected 6-fold-higher CO2 fluxes in vegetated compared to bare sediments, as well as 10- to 100-fold-higher CH4 fluxes. Warming led to an increase in net CO2 and CH4 fluxes, reaching average fluxes of 10 422.18 +/- 2570.12 mu mol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) and 88.11 +/- 15.19 mu mol CH4 m(-2) d(-1), while CO2 and CH4 fluxes decreased over time in sediments maintained at 25 degrees C. Prolonged darkness led to an increase in CO2 fluxes but a decrease in CH4 fluxes in vegetated sediments. These results add to previous research identifying Red Sea seagrass meadows as a significant source of CH4, while also indicating that sublethal warming may lead to increased emissions of greenhouse gases from seagrass meadows, providing a feedback mechanism that may contribute to further enhancing global warming.

TI  - Relative sea-level change regulates organic carbon accumulation in coastal habitats
AB  - Because coastal habitats store large amounts of organic carbon (C org ), the conservation and restoration of these habitats are considered to be important measures for mitigating global climate change. Although future sea-level rise is predicted to change the characteristics of these habitats, its impact on their rate of C org sequestration is highly uncertain. Here we used historical depositional records to show that relative sea-level (RSL) changes regulated C org accumulation rates in boreal contiguous seagrassâ€“saltmarsh habitats. Ageâ€“depth modeling and geological and biogeochemical approaches indicated that C org accumulation rates varied as a function of changes in depositional environments and habitat relocations. In particular, C org accumulation rates were enhanced in subtidal seagrass meadows during times of RSL rise, which were caused by postseismic land subsidence and climate change. Our findings identify historical analogs for the future impact of RSL rise driven by global climate change on rates of C org sequestration in coastal habitats. Â© 2018 The Authors.

TI  - Oxygen and carbon metabolism of Zostera muelleri across a depth gradient - Implications for resilience and blue carbon
AB  - There is growing interest in the role that seagrasses play as `blue carbon' stores or sinks, and their potential to offset rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere. This study measured primary aspects of the carbon balance (biomass, community metabolism, dissolved organic carbon {[}DOC] fluxes, seston trapping) across the depth gradient in a Zostera muelleri meadow during the seasonal biomass minimum and maximum. Over the annual estimation, the meadow was neither a sink nor source of carbon, with inputs of seston (similar to 58\% of total inputs) balanced by exports of wrack and DOC. The carbon sink represented by wrack export depends on the nature of the environment where the wrack accumulates; if it reaches subtidal sediments it will largely be remineralised over the annual cycle, whereas between 14 and 26\% of the wrack may be preserved if the material is exported to terrestrial environments. The fate of DOC exuded by seagrasses is unknown due to a lack of knowledge about its composition and lability; however, a number of lines of evidence suggest that a large fraction of DOC is mineralised. The net community metabolism (NCM) of the meadow was balanced, indicating that photosynthetic 02 production balanced community respiration and/or the reoxidation of reduced compounds (sulphur and iron) in the rhizosphere. We suggest that a balanced NCM may be the preferred state for Zostera spp. and may limit their occurrence in environments where plants cannot balance the respiratory demand exerted by seston inputs. There was a close coupling between metabolism and biomass, which in turn is forced by antecedent light over the preceding 120 days (the time integration window for antecedent light that best predicted biomass). Increased metabolism with depth and seasonal variation in light is accompanied by a decrease in the above ground:below ground biomass ratio (AGB:BGB). This trend is suggested to be a morphological adaptation that balances the competing requirements of maintaining a neutral plant carbon balance across enrichment and light gradients. Our results suggest that Zostera muelleri may be most important as a `blue carbon' store (i.e. carbon stored as biomass standing stock), which is therefore vulnerable to degradation if seagrasses are lost.

TI  - Climate Change Mitigation: from Carbon Cycle to Policy
AB  - Climate change can be mitigated simultaneously by two ways, maintaining the greenhouse gases below the carbon budget and conserving marine and terrestrial vegetation for carbon sequestration. Marine vegetation (e.g. mangrove and seagrass meadows) is less than 0.5\% of the total marine area and narrower compared to terrestrial vegetation. However, marine vegetation has high net primary production (NPP) and contributes more than 50\% of the global carbon burial in its substrate and biomass. Indonesia has 3,301,848 ha of mangrove area, the widest in South-East Asia. The seagrass meadows of Indonesia are 150,693 ha, the second widest seagrass area in the world. These two ecosystems are important for the global carbon cycle due to their high capacity for carbon sequestration. Considering this potential, it is necessary to promote a strategic scientific-based policy of conservation of marine vegetation areas for both local and national stakeholders. The policies consist of: 1) to implement the National/Local Action Plan for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions (RAN/D GRK); 2) to manage the land use changes that contribute 67\% of total national emissions; 3) to determine coastal ecosystem protection areas that are considering the province policy in the Plan for Zoning of Coastal Areas and Small Islands (RZWP3K); 4) to rehabilitate terrestrial vegetation, coastal ecosystems, and aquatic conservation areas (President Regulation no 61/2011); and 5) to strictly carry out the national policy for green open space (Government Regulation no 26/2008).

TI  - Carbon-offset potential from tropical seagrass conservation in selected areas of Indonesia
AB  - Seagrass carbon emission is mainly due to the land-use change; therefore, conservation will be an approach required for carbon offset. A method for estimating carbon offset from conservation activities has been devel-oped. This study aims to evaluate the carbon-offset potential of the seagrass ecosystem by applying this method to five provinces in Indonesia. North Maluku has the widest seagrass area, but only 5\% of this is the conserved area. Meanwhile, Jakarta has the highest percentage of its conserved seagrass within the area. Emission reduction at the year 2020 ranged 0.03-1.02 tC/year (with leakage) or 0.05-2.04 tC/year (without leakage). The percentage of emission reduction among the five provinces ranged from 0.75\% to 11.3\%. About 9.03 tC/year emission from seagrass ecosystems in Jakarta will decrease by up to 8.01 tC/year. Further assessment shows a positive correlation between the percentage of the conserved area and the percentage of emission reduction.

TI  - Climate change and Mediterranean seagrass meadows: a synopsis for environmental managers
AB  - This synopsis focuses on the effects of climate change on Mediterranean seagrasses, and associated communities, and on the contribution of the main species, Posidonia oceanica, to the mitigation of climate change effects through sequestering carbon dioxide. Whilst the regression of seagrass meadows is well documented, generally linked to anthropogenic pressures, global warming could be a cause of new significant regression, notably linked to the introduction of exotic species, the rise of Sea-Surface Temperature (SST), and relative sea level. Seagrass communities could also be affected by climate change through the replacement of high structural complexity seagrass species by species of lower complexity and even by opportunistic introduced species. Although it is currently very difficult to predict the consequences of these alterations and their cascade effects, two main potential conflicting trends in the functioning of seagrass ecosystems are acceleration of the herbivore pathway or the detritivore pathway. The mean net primary production of the dominant species, Posidonia oceanica, is relatively high and can be estimated to range between 92.5 to 144.7 g C m(-2) a(-1). Around 27\% of the total carbon fixed by this species enters the sedimentary pathway leading to formation, over millennia, of highly organic deposits, rich in refractory carbon. At the Mediterranean scale, the sequestration rate might reach 1.09 Tg C a(-1). The amount of this stored carbon is estimated to range from 71 to 273 kg C m(-2), which when considered at the Mediterranean scale would represent 11 to 42\% of the CO2 emissions produced by Mediterranean countries since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. The greatest value of the P. oceanica ecosystem, in the context of mitigation of global climate change, is linked to this vast long-term carbon stock accumulated over millennia, and therefore, efforts should be focused on preserving the meadows to keep this reservoir intact.

TI  - Blue carbon sequestration dynamics within tropical seagrass sediments: long-term incubations for changes over climatic scales
AB  - Determination of blue carbon sequestration in seagrass sediments over climatic time scales (>100 years) relies on several assumptions, including no loss of particulate organic carbon (POC) after 1-2 years, tight coupling between POC loss and CO2 emissions, no dissolution of carbonates, and removal of the recalcitrant black carbon (BC) contribution. We tested these assumptions via 500-day anoxic decomposition and mineralisation experiments to capture centennial parameter decay dynamics from two sediment horizons robustly dated as 2 and 18 years old. No loss of BC was detected, and decay of POC was best described for both horizons by near-identical reactivity continuum models. The models predicted average losses of 49 and 51\% after 100 years of burial for the surface and 20-22-cm horizons respectively. However, the loss rate of POC was far greater than the release rate of CO2, even after accounting for CO2 from particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) production, possibly as siderite. The deficit could not be attributed to dissolved organic carbon or dark CO2 fixation. Instead, evidence based on delta(CO2)-C-13, acidity and lack of sulfate reduction suggested methanogenesis. The results indicated the importance of centennial losses of POC and PIC precipitation and possibly methanogenesis in estimating carbon sequestration rates.

TI  - Challenges to select suitable habitats and demonstrate `additionality' in Blue Carbon projects: A seagrass case study
AB  - Seagrass restoration has been suggested as a Blue Carbon (BC) strategy for climate change mitigation. For Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) and carbon crediting schemes, BC projects need to demonstrate `additionality', that is enhanced CO2 sequestration and/or avoided greenhouse gas emissions following management actions. This typically requires determining soil carbon accumulation rates (CAR), which is often done using radionuclides or surface elevation tables to estimate sedimentation rates. Here we undertook a case study, using Pb-210 and C-14 dating, to detect possible changes in C-org stocks and CAR following the loss and partial recovery of Posidonia seagrass meadows in South Australia since 1980-90s. The Pb-210 data revealed a lack of accumulation of excess Pb-210 in most sites, suggesting negligible accumulation of sediments, intense mixing of the upper layers, or accumulation of reworked sediments, precluding the estimation of reliable CAR at decadal time scales. This limitation was also encountered with C-14. The inability to compare sites over analogous periods of time prevented quantifying differences in soil C org sequestration, thereby to demonstrate additionality. The lack of significant differences in soil C org stocks among sites which never suffered seagrass loss, those showing recovery and those with no recovery (5.7 +/- 1.2, 4.5 +/- 0.7 and 3.3 +/- 0.3 kg C-org, m(-)(2) within the top meter, respectively) also precluded estimates of soil C org gains or losses. Our findings demonstrate that, while Pb-210 and C-14 provide important information on sediment deposition dynamics, it is not straightforward to demonstrate additionality using radionuclides in low depositional seagrass habitats exposed to hydrodynamic energy, features which may be encountered in seagrass sites. We provide insights for the selection of suitable habitats for seagrass BC projects, suggest possible alternative methods for estimating additionality, and discuss the implications of the findings for the implementation of seagrass BC strategies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Carbon stock in the Thalassia hemprichii and Cymodocea rotundata predominated seagrass species at coastal waters of Pramuka Island, Indonesia
AB  - Seagrass beds are important carbon sinks that play a potential role in climate mitigation. The amount of carbon stored in seagrass ecosystems is greatly determined by the size of the seagrass species. This study aimed to determine the differences between carbon stocks in large seagrass represented by Thalassia hemprichii and smaller seagrass represented by Cymodocea rotundata in Pramuka Island, Seribu Islands, DKI Jakarta (Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta). Four stations were selected purposively to represent sites with different densities and predominant species. The parameters measured were characteristics of seagrass (species density, leaf area, biomass, and carbon stock) and environmental parameters (water depth and sediment grain size distribution). Seagrass carbon stock was measured using the Loss on Ignition (LOI) method. The results showed that the seagrass T. hemprichii had a higher density, leaf area, biomass, and carbon stock than those C. rotundata. The carbon stock of T. hemprichii in Pramuka Island was 18.22-443.73 g C m(-2) while C. rotundata was 5.99-25.61 g C m(-2). Moreover, large seagrasses have great potential to deposit more carbon in seagrass sediments. The analysis using PCA showed a relationship between the size of seagrass morphology and the amount of carbon stock. This study shows that seagrasses with large morphology strongly support the high value of carbon stocks stored in seagrass ecosystems.

TI  - Seaweed fails to prevent ocean acidification impact on foraminifera along a shallow-water CO2 gradient
AB  - Ocean acidification causes biodiversity loss, alters ecosystems, and may impact food security, as shells of small organisms dissolve easily in corrosive waters. There is a suggestion that photosynthetic organisms could mitigate ocean acidification on a local scale, through seagrass protection or seaweed cultivation, as net ecosystem organic production raises the saturation state of calcium carbonate making seawater less corrosive. Here, we used a natural gradient in calcium carbonate saturation, caused by shallow-water CO2 seeps in the Mediterranean Sea, to assess whether seaweed that is resistant to acidification (Padina pavonica) could prevent adverse effects of acidification on epiphytic foraminifera. We found a reduction in the number of species of foraminifera as calcium carbonate saturation state fell and that the assemblage shifted from one dominated by calcareous species at reference sites (pH similar to 8.19) to one dominated by agglutinated foraminifera at elevated levels of CO2 (pH similar to 7.71). It is expected that ocean acidification will result in changes in foraminiferal assemblage composition and agglutinated forms may become more prevalent. Although Padina did not prevent adverse effects of ocean acidification, high biomass stands of seagrass or seaweed farms might be more successful in protecting epiphytic foraminifera.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Estimation of Seagrass Percent Cover and LAI for Above Ground Carbon Sequestration Mapping
AB  - Seagrasses are distinct flowering plants which thrive underwater. They are part of a complex ecosystem that supports different forms of life. Recent studies found out that coastal wetlands - mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrass, are far more proficient in sequestering and storing carbon than terrestrial ecosystems. Although seagrasses occupy only 0.2\% of the area of the oceans, they sequester approximately 15\% of total carbon storage in the ocean. Several remote sensing techniques are available to map and monitor seagrasses but most of them focus only on extent and area coverage. To estimate the carbon sequestration of seagrass beds, aside from extent, other parameters are needed such as leaf area index, percent cover, density, biomass etc., However, there are limits in mapping seagrass parameters using remote sensing. The reflectance measured by sensors is affected by other factors such as water absorption, turbidity, dissolved organic matter, depth and phytoplankton which affects the backscattering of energy. In this study, different remotely sensed datasets and field data were used to measure the parameters needed to estimate the carbon sequestration. Multispectral satellite images such as Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope were utilized to map the distribution and percent cover. High-resolution RGB images obtained by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were also utilized to correlate field data gathered parameters. Field data such as species, percent cover, leaf area index, canopy height and above ground biomass were gathered in situ. Data extracted from different remote sensing technologies were put together to support the estimation of carbon sequestration of seagrass beds.

TI  - Hot Spots of Carbon and Alkalinity Cycling in the Coastal Oceans
AB  - Ocean calcium carbonate (CaCO3) production and preservation play a key role in the global carbon cycle. Coastal and continental shelf (neritic) environments account for more than half of global CaCO3 accumulation. Previous neritic CaCO3 budgets have been limited in both spatial resolution and ability to project responses to environmental change. Here, a 1 degrees spatially explicit budget for neritic CaCO3 accumulation is developed. Globally gridded satellite and benthic community area data are used to estimate community CaCO3 production. Accumulation rates (PgC yr(-1)) of four neritic environments are calculated: coral reefs/banks (0.084), seagrass-dominated embayments (0.043), and carbonate rich (0.037) and poor (0.0002) shelves. This analysis refines previous neritic CaCO3 accumulation estimates (-0.16) and shows almost all coastal carbonate accumulation occurs in the tropics, >50\% of coral reef accumulation occurs in the Western Pacific Ocean, and 80\% of coral reef, 63\% of carbonate shelf, and 58\% of bay accumulation occur within three global carbonate hot spots: the Western Pacific Ocean, Eastern Indian Ocean, and Caribbean Sea. These algorithms are amenable for incorporation into Earth System Models that represent open ocean pelagic CaCO3 production and deep-sea preservation and assess impacts and feedbacks of environmental change.

TI  - Blue Carbon in Coastal Phragmites Wetlands Along the Southern Baltic Sea
AB  - Coastal wetlands are important for carbon (C) storage and sequestration. Still, there are large knowledge gaps concerning the amount of ``blue carbon{''} in coastal wetlands dominated by common reed (Phragmites australis). We quantified carbon stocks at the southern Baltic Sea coast at six representative Phragmites wetland sites at the Darss-Zingst-Bodden Chain (DZBC) and the Strelasund, which include different categories of adjacent land use (arable land, woodland, pasture, urban), topography (totally flat to undulating), and geographical restrictions (dyking). Sediment samples were taken to a depth of 1 m, in line with the IPCC guidelines, and total carbon concentrations and bulk densities were measured in 10 cm intervals. The sites stored, on average, 17.4 kg C m(-2) with large variability between sites, ranging from 1.76 to 88.6 kg C m(-2). The estimated average is generally in good agreement with carbon stocks reported for tidal salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrass meadows. According to our estimation, based on widths of the reed belts and carbon stocks at the sampled sites, approximately 264,600 t of blue carbon could be stored in the coastal reed belts along the DZBC, a typical lagoon system of the southern Baltic Sea. Our study underlines the importance of these unique ecotones between land and sea for storage and sequestration of blue carbon. Since Phragmites is also a common (sometimes invasive) species along other large brackish water basins, such as the Black Sea or Chesapeake Bay, these estimates can be used for improved precision of modeling blue carbon budgets.

TI  - Blue carbon stocks and exchanges along the California coast
AB  - Salt marshes and seagrass meadows can sequester and store high quantities of organic carbon (OC) in their sediments relative to other marine and terrestrial habitats. Assessing carbon stocks, carbon sources, and the transfer of carbon between habitats within coastal seascapes are each integral in identifying the role of blue carbon habitats in coastal carbon cycling. Here, we quantified carbon stocks, sources, and exchanges in seagrass meadows, salt marshes, and unvegetated sediments in six bays along the California coast. In the top 20 cm of sediment, the salt marshes contained approximately twice as much OC as seagrass meadows did, 4.92 +/- 0.36 kg OC m(-2) compared to 2.20 +/- 0.24 kg OC m(-2), respectively. Both salt marsh and seagrass sediment carbon stocks were higher than previous estimates from this region but lower than global and US-wide averages, respectively. Seagrass-derived carbon was deposited annually into adjacent marshes during fall seagrass senescence. However, isotope mixing models estimate that negligible amounts of this seagrass material were ultimately buried in underlying sediment. Rather, the vast majority of OC in sediment across sites was likely derived from planktonic/benthic diatoms and/or C-3 salt marsh plants.

TI  - Blue carbon stocks of great barrier reef deep-water seagrasses
AB  - Shallow-water seagrasses capture and store globally significant quantities of organic carbon (OC), often referred to as 'Blue Carbon'; however, data are lacking on the importance of deep-water (greater than 15 m) seagrasses as Blue Carbon sinks. We compared OC stocks from deep-, mid- A nd shallow-water seagrasses at Lizard Island within the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon. We found deep-water seagrass (Halophila species) contained similar levels of OC to shallow-water species (e.g. Halodule uninervis) (0.64 Â± 0.08% and 0.9 Â± 0.1 mg C cm-3, 0.87 Â± 0.19% and 1.3 Â± 0.3 mg C cm-3, respectively), despite being much sparser and smaller in stature. Deep-water seagrass sediments contained significantly higher levels (approx. ninefold) of OC than surrounding bare areas. Inorganic carbon (CaCO3) levels were relatively high in deep-water seagrass sediments (8.2 Â± 0.4%) and, if precipitated from epiphytes within the meadow, could offset the potential CO2-sink capacity of these meadows. The Î´13C signatures of sediment samples varied among depths and habitats (-10.9 and-17.0), reflecting contributions from autochthonous and allochthonous sources. If the OC stocks reported in this study are similar to deep-water Halophila meadows elsewhere within the GBR lagoon (total area 31 000 km2), then OC bound within this system is roughly estimated at 27.4 million tonnes.

TI  - Pathways for implementation of blue carbon initiatives
AB  - Coastal blue carbon activities are being implemented by a variety of countries, using different approaches. Existing regulatory regimes, including on coastal protection, are still very useful tools to protect and conserve mangroves, seagrasses and saltmarshes, and preserve their carbon value and role. These approaches suffer, however, from traditional' issues such as lack of enforcement, human and financial constraints as well as unclear or misguiding government mandates. Successes are witnessed using a community-based carbon project approach, ensuring high stakeholder participation via direct or indirect incentive programmes. Comprehensive coastal zone management approaches seem very promising, but success overall, and regarding carbon specifically, are yet to be reported. The Paris Agreement has introduced new tools which could serve as means to trigger more and better coastal adaptation and mitigation efforts. Their implementation details are, however, still under negotiation and their impacts can only be expected in a few years.

TI  - Geographic variability in organic carbon stock and accumulation rate in sediments of East and Southeast Asian seagrass meadows
AB  - Organic carbon (OC) stored in the sediments of seagrass meadows has been considered a globally significant OC reservoir. However, the sparsity and regional bias of studies on long-term OC accumulation in coastal sediments have limited reliable estimation of the capacity of seagrass meadows as a global OC sink. We evaluated the amount and accumulation rate of OC in sediment of seagrass meadows and adjacent areas in East and Southeast Asia. In temperate sites, the average OC concentration in the top 30 cm of sediment was higher in seagrass meadows (780-1080 mmol g(-1)) than in sediments without seagrass cover (52-430 mmol g(-1)). The average OC in the top 30 cm of subtropical and tropical seagrass meadow sediments ranged from 140 to 440 mmol g(-1). Carbon isotope mass balancing suggested that the contribution of seagrass-derived carbon to OC stored in sediments was often relatively minor (temperate: 10-40\%; subtropical: 35-82\%; tropical: 4-34\%) and correlated to the habitat type, being particularly low in estuarine habitats. Stock of OC in the top meter of sediment of all the studied meadows ranged from 38 to 120 Mg ha(-1). The sediment accumulation rates were estimated by radiocarbon dating of six selected cores (0.32-1.34 mm yr(-1)). The long-term OC accumulation rates calculated from the sediment accumulation rate and the top 30 cm average OC concentration for the seagrass meadows (24-101 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) were considerably lower than the OC accumulation rates previously reported for Mediterranean Posidonia oceanica meadows (580 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) on average). Current estimates for the global carbon sink capacity of seagrass meadows, which rely largely on Mediterranean studies, may be considerable overestimations.

TI  - Plant and sediment properties in seagrass meadows from two Mediterranean CO2 vents: Implications for carbon storage capacity of acidified oceans
AB  - Assessing the status of important carbon sinks such as seagrass meadows is of primary importance when dealing with potential climate change mitigation strategies. This study examined plant and sediment properties in seagrass meadows (Cymodocea nodosa (Ucria) Asch.) from two high pCO2â€“low pH Mediterranean vent systems, located at Milos (Greece) and Vulcano (Italy) Islands, providing insights on carbon storage potential in future acidified oceans. Contrary to what has been suggested, carbon content (both inorganic and organic) and its surficial accumulation decreased at high pCO2â€“low pH in comparison with controls. The decrease in inorganic carbon may result from the higher solubility of carbonates due to the more acidic conditions. At Vulcano, the seagrass properties (e.g., leaf area, biomass) appeared negatively affected by environmental conditions at high pCO2â€“low pH conditions and this may have had a detrimental effect on the organic carbon content and accumulation. At Milos, organic carbon decreased at high pCO2â€“low pH conditions, despite the increase in seagrass aboveground biomass, leaf length and area, probably as a consequence of site-specific features, which need further investigation and may include both biotic and abiotic factors (e.g., oligotrophic conditions, decreased sedimentation rate and input of allochthonous material). Results suggest that, in contrast to previous predictions based exclusively on the expected positive response of seagrasses to ocean acidification, carbon storage capacity of the seagrass C. nodosa may not increase at high pCO2-low pH conditions. This study emphasizes the need to investigate further the potential alteration in the climate mitigation service delivered by seagrass meadows in acidified oceans. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Short Term CO2 Enrichment Increases Carbon Sequestration of Air-Exposed Intertidal Communities of a Coastal Lagoon
AB  - In situ production responses of air-exposed intertidal communities under CO2 enrichment are reported here for the first time. We assessed the short-term effects of CO2 on the light responses of the net community production (NCP) and community respiration (CR) of intertidal Z. noltei and unvegetated sediment communities of Ria Formosa lagoon, when exposed to air. NCP and CR were measured in situ in summer and winter, under present and CO2 enriched conditions using benthic chambers. Within chamber CO2 evolution measurements were carried out by a series of short-term incubations (30 min) using an infra-red gas analyser. Liner regression models fitted to the NCP-irradiance responses were used to estimate the seasonal budgets of air-exposed, intertidal production as determined by the daily and seasonal variation of incident photosynthetic active radiation. High CO2 resulted in higher CO2 sequestration by both communities in both summer and winter seasons. Lower respiration rates of both communities under high CO2 further contributed to a potential negative climate feedback, except in winter when the CR of sediment community was higher. The light compensation points (LCP) (light intensity where production equals respiration) of Z. noltei and sediment communities also decreased under CO2 enriched conditions in both seasons. The seasonal community production of Z. noltei was 115.54 +/- 7.58 g C m(-2) season(-1) in summer and 29.45 +/- 4.04 g C m(-2) season(-1) in winter and of unvegetated sediment was 91.28 +/- 6.32 g C m(-2) season(-1) in summer and 25.83 +/- 4.01 g C m(-2) season(-1) in winter under CO2 enriched conditions. Future CO2 conditions may increase air-exposed seagrass production by about 1.5-fold and unvegetated sediments by about 1.2-fold.

TI  - Dynamics of benthic metabolism, O-2, and pCO(2) in a temperate seagrass meadow
AB  - Seagrass meadows play an important role in ``blue carbon{'' sequestration and storage, but their dynamic metabolism is not fully understood. In a dense Zostera marina meadow, we measured benthic O-2 fluxes by aquatic eddy covariance, water column concentrations of O-2, and partial pressures of CO2 (pCO(2)) over 21 full days during peak growing season in April and June. Seagrass metabolism, derived from the O-2 flux, varied markedly between the 2 months as biomass accumulated and water temperature increased from 16 degrees C to 28 degrees C, triggering a twofold increase in respiration and a trophic shift of the seagrass meadow from being a carbon sink to a carbon source. Seagrass metabolism was the major driver of diurnal fluctuations in water column O-2 concentration and pCO(2), ranging from 173 to 377 mu mol L-1 and 193 to 859 ppmv, respectively. This 4.5-fold variation in pCO(2) was observed despite buffering by the carbonate system. Hysteresis in diurnal water column pCO(2) vs. O-2 concentration was attributed to storage of O-2 and CO2 in seagrass tissue, air-water exchange of O-2 and CO2, and CO2 storage in surface sediment. There was a \~{} 1:1 mol-to-mol stoichiometric relationship between diurnal fluctuations in concentrations of O-2 and dissolved inorganic carbon. Our measurements showed no stimulation of photosynthesis at high CO2 and low O-2 concentrations, even though CO2 reached levels used in IPCC ocean acidification scenarios. This field study does not support the notion that seagrass meadows may be ``winners{''} in future oceans with elevated CO2 concentrations and more frequent temperature extremes.

TI  - Sediment carbon sink in low-density temperate eelgrass meadows (Baltic Sea)
AB  - Seagrass meadows are highly productive habitats that can act as ``blue carbon sinks{''} in coastal ecosystems by facilitating sedimentation and trapping particles. However, the magnitude and occurrence of these effects may be species and density dependent. The present study is the first estimation of seagrass sediment carbon sink in the temperate Zostera marina beds in the Baltic Sea. Several descriptors of organic matter characteristics, along with possible organic matter sources in the sediment were compared at vegetated and unvegetated bottoms. The Pb-210 dating of the sediment has been used for accumulation rate assessment. The photopigments and POC concentrations in sediments were higher in vegetated bottoms. The SIAR (Stable Isotopes in R) mixing model based on nitrogen and carbon stable isotope values, indicated that higher percentages of organic matter originated from seagrass production in vegetated sediments (40-45\%) compared to unvegetated ones (5-21\%). The carbon stock in the upper 10 cm of the vegetated sediments ranged from 50.2 +/- 2.2 to 228.0 +/- 11.6 (gm(-2)), whereas the annual C accumulation amount from 0.84 +/- 0.2 to 3.85 +/- 1.2 (g m(-2) yr(-1)). Our study shows that even the relatively weakly developed vegetation of the small temperate seagrass species enhance organic carbon concentration in the sediments. Estimated carbon stock was much lower than those reported for most of the seagrass meadows elsewhere, and the carbon burial rate was the lowest ever reported. Evidently, the global calculations of sediment carbon stock should be reconsidered by taking into account density and species-related variability.

TI  - MAPPING OF BLUE CARBON ECOSYSTEMS: EFFECT OF PROXIMITY, ACTIVITY TYPES AND FREQUENCY OF VISITS IN THE ACCURACY OF PARTICIPATORY MAPS
AB  - Interest in blue carbon has drastically increased in recent years, particularly in improving the coastal resource carbon storage estimates and the development of methodology for identifying and monitoring such resources. In coastal resource mapping, participatory mapping techniques have the potential to provide a level of granularity and detail by taking advantage of local knowledge. In this work, we aim to evaluate the agreement between blue carbon ecosystem status obtained from participatory mapping versus the ones discriminated from satellite images, as well as assess how ``relative proximity{''} to landmarks affects the accuracy. Results showed that the accuracy of mapped mangrove extents, evaluated as intersection-over-union, is positively correlated with frequency of visits. It is also found that maps generated by participants who have jobs or activities that nurture awareness about mangroves and seagrasses tend to agree better with remotely-sensed maps. The participants were even able to identify small patches of mangroves and seagrasses that are not present in the classified satellite images. While our initial work explores factors that impact the consistency between these sources, there is a need to establish a baseline for which both sources of information are evaluated against; and define relevant accuracy metrics. Our final goal is to systematically combine these two sources of information for an accurate holistic coastal resource map.

TI  - High variability of Blue Carbon storage in seagrass meadows at the estuary scale
AB  - Seagrass meadows are considered important natural carbon sinks due to their capacity to store organic carbon (C-org) in sediments. However, the spatial heterogeneity of carbon storage in seagrass sediments needs to be better understood to improve accuracy of Blue Carbon assessments, particularly when strong gradients are present. We performed an intensive coring study within a sub-tropical estuary to assess the spatial variability in sedimentary C-org associated with seagrasses, and to identify the key factors promoting this variability. We found a strong spatial pattern within the estuary, from 52.16 mg C-org cm(-3) in seagrass meadows in the upper parts, declining to 1.06 mg C-org cm(-3) in seagrass meadows at the estuary mouth, despite a general gradient of increasing seagrass cover and seagrass habitat extent in the opposite direction. The sedimentary C-org underneath seagrass meadows came principally from allochthonous (non-seagrass) sources (similar to 70-90 \%), while the contribution of seagrasses was low (similar to 10-30 \%) throughout the entire estuary. Our results showed that C-org stored in sediments of seagrass meadows can be highly variable within an estuary, attributed largely to accumulation of fine sediments and inputs of allochthonous sources. Local features and the existence of spatial gradients must be considered in Blue Carbon estimates in coastal ecosystems.

TI  - Blue Carbon Stocks and Cross-Habitat Subsidies
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (including saltmarsh, mangrove, seagrass meadows, and other soft sediment habitats) play a valuable role in aquatic carbon dynamics and contribute significantly to global climate change mitigation. However, these habitats are undergoing rapid and accelerating shifts in extent due to climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we demonstrate that blue carbon stocks vary across habitats and that cross-habitat subsidies of carbon contribute significantly to blue carbon stocks. Using a case study estuary from New Zealand, organic carbon stocks in above ground biomass and sediment to 100 cm varied significantly between habitat types, from saltmarsh (90 t ha(-1)), to mangrove (46 t ha(-1)), to seagrass (27 t ha(-1)) and unvegetated habitats (26 t ha(-1)). Despite being typically overlooked in blue carbon literature, unvegetated habitats contained the majority of estuarine carbon stocks when adjusted for their large extent within the estuary (occupying 68.4\% of the estuarine area and containing 57\% of carbon stocks). When carbon stocks were further refined based on delta C-13 and delta N-15 mixing model results, coastal vegetation (saltmarsh, mangrove, and seagrass) was found to provide important cross-habitat subsidies of carbon throughout the estuary, including contributing an estimated 41\% of organic carbon within unvegetated sediments, and 51\% of the total carbon stock throughout the estuary (yet occupying only 31.6\% of the estuary). Given the connected nature of blue carbon ecosystems these findings illustrate the importance of considering the contribution and cross-habitat subsidies of both vegetated and unvegetated habitats to blue carbon stocks in estuaries. This provides critical context when assessing the impact of shifts in habitat distributions due to impacts from climate change and anthropogenic stressors.

TI  - Blue Carbon stock in Zostera noltei meadows at Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal) over a decade
AB  - This work assessed the Blue Carbon (C) stock in the seagrass meadows (Zostera noltei) of Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal), and evaluated its spatio-temporal trend over the 2003-2005 to 2013-2014 period. Zostera noltei spatial distribution, restricted to intertidal areas in 2014, was mapped by remote sensing using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and aerial photography. Zostera noltei biomass was also monitored in situ over a year and its Blue C stock was estimated. By 2014, intertidal meadows covered an area of 226 +/- 4 ha and their Blue C stock ranged from 227 +/- 6 to 453 +/- 13 Mg C. Overall, Ria de Aveiro Z. noltei intertidal meadows increased in extent over the 2003-2005 to 2013-2014 period, corroborating the recent declining trend reversal observed in Europe and contrary to the global decline trend. This spatio-temporal shift might be related to a natural adjustment of the intertidal meadows to past human intervention in Ria de Aveiro, namely large-scale dredging activities, particularly in the 1996-1998 period, combined with the more accurate assessment performed in 2014 using the UAV. This recovery contributes to the effective increase of the Blue C stock in Ria de Aveiro and, ultimately, to supporting climate regulation and improving ecosystem health. However, major dredging activities are foreseen in the system's management plan, which can again endanger the recovery trend of Z. noltei intertidal meadows in Ria de Aveiro.

TI  - Deforested Mangroves Affect the Potential for Carbon Linkages between Connected Ecosystems
AB  - Mangrove forests are important sinks and sources of carbon especially for connections to coral reefs and seagrass beds. However, they are increasing under threat from anthropogenic influences. We investigated correlations between carbon fluxes from the sediment and water column in deforested and intact mangroves. Our findings show that deforestation has a negative effect on sediment organic carbon storage and CO2 fluxes. However, species richness and density showed a positive correlation with sediment organic carbon storage and CO2 fluxes. An increased density of saplings showed a positive relationship with dissolved inorganic and organic carbon draining the mangrove forest at high tide. This research offers insights into the importance of the key forest characteristics influencing the storage and fluxes of carbon. Alterations in mangrove carbon stocks and retention may affect connected ecosystems.

TI  - Effects of small-scale, shading-induced seagrass loss on blue carbon storage: Implications for management of degraded seagrass ecosystems
AB  - 1. Seagrass meadows are important global blue carbon sinks. Despite a 30\% loss of seagrasses globally during the last century, there is limited empirical research investigating the effects of disturbance and loss of seagrass on blue carbon stocks. 2. In this study, we hypothesised that seagrass loss would reduce blue carbon stocks. Using shading cloth, we simulated small-scale die-offs of two subtropical seagrass species, Halodule wrightii and Thalassia testudinum, in a dynamic northern Gulf of Mexico lagoon. The change in quantity and quality of sediment organic matter (OM) and organic carbon was compared among die-off, control and bare plots before the die-off treatment, shortly after the die-off treatment and 11 months after the die-off treatment. Pb-210 age dating was performed on bare and Thalassia plots at 11 months to evaluate the impact of sediment erosion in the absence of vegetation. 3. The small-scale die-off led to a 50\%-65\% OM loss in the sediment in the top 8 cm of Halodule plots. Thalassia plots lost significant portions of OM (50\%) and organic carbon (C-org; 21\%-47\%) in only the top 1 cm of sediment. The Pb-210 profiles indicated Thalassia die-off reduced the C-org sequestration rate by 10\%, in addition to a loss of c. 1 year's worth of C-org stocks (c. 22 g/m(2)). Furthermore, analyses on OM/C-org quality indicated a loss of labile OM/C-org and enhanced remineralisation by microbes. 4.Synthesis and applications. This study provides empirical evidence that small-scale shading-induced seagrass die-offs can reduce seagrass carbon sequestration capacity and trigger losses of blue carbon stocks. While the losses recorded here are modest, these losses in blue carbon storage capacity are notable due to the proximity of shading structures (e.g. boat docks) to seagrass habitats. Thus, policies to avoid or protect seagrass habitats from common small-scale, shading disturbances are important for optimising both carbon sequestration capacity and coastline development and management.
