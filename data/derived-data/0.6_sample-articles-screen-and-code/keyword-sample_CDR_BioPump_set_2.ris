TI  - Minimal effect of iron fertilization on sea-surface carbon dioxide concentrations
AB  - IT has long been hypothesized that iron concentrations limit phyto-plankton productivity in some parts of the ocean1-3. As a result, iron may have played a role in modulating atmospheric CO2 levels between glacial and interglacial times4, and it has been proposed5 that large-scale deposition of iron in the ocean might be an effective way to combat the rise of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere. As part of an experiment in the equatorial Pacific Ocean6, we observed the effect on dissolved CO2 of enriching a small (8x8 km) patch of water with iron. We saw significant depression of surface fugacities of CO2 within 48 hours of the iron release, which did not change systematically after that time. But the effect was only a small fraction (âˆ¼10%) of the CO2 drawdown that would have occurred had the enrichment resulted in the complete utilization of all the available nitrate and phosphate. Thus artificial fertilization of this ocean region did not cause a very large change in the surface CO2 concentration, in contrast to the effect observed in incubation experiments3, where addition of similar concentrations of iron usually results in complete depletion of nutrients. Although our experiment does not necessarily mimic all circum-stances under which iron deposition might occur naturally, our results do not support the idea that iron fertilization would signifi-cantly affect atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

TI  - Environmental impact assessment for an OTEC plant in Martinique Island [MÃ©thodologie d'Ã©tude des impacts d'une centrale d'Ã©nergie thermique des mers (ETM) en Martinique]
AB  - The Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) is a marine renewable energy system that uses the temperature difference between the cold deep waters and warm surface waters to produce electricity. DCNS, a world-expert in naval defence and an innovator in energy has conducted technical, juridical and environmental feasibility studies of a plant offshore Martinique under an agreement with the Regional Council. In this context, DCNS realised a preliminary Environmental Impact Assessment in order to prepare public debate to be done further. Due to innovation of such a project, a specific methodology has been done for that. First step was to study bibliography in details, for site assessment of course, but also for impacts of other projects in the world that should present relevant similarities with OTEC (coastal thermal power plants for example). This bibliographic study dealt with thematic synthesis for each topic of physical, biological and human field that could be impacted by the project (total of 28 topics). The aim was to define priorities for specific assessments that have been done further: acoustic impacts, biogeochemical impacts of artificial upwelling, biofouling impacts, etc. Some of these topics are now on course with specific scientific research programs that have been launched at the end of this study. For each new topic, a specific methodology has been used or adapted for OTEC. These methods are made step by step, with a preliminary approach followed by a specific research program when it is necessary. Noise prediction has been done with a specific tool used for ship construction industry and a 3D propagation modelling. Biofouling has been assessed by a bibliographic approach and will be prÃ©cised further with experimental moorings. Biogeochemical and biological impacts due to artificial and localised upwelling are now being studied in details with a double skill approach (physical modelling and plankton analysis), after preliminary water chemicals' analysis and modelling.

TI  - Efficiency of carbon removal per added iron in ocean iron fertilization
AB  - The major response to ocean iron fertilization is by large diatoms, which at Fe-replete ambient seawater show an optimum C:Fe elemental ratio of similar to 23 000 and a higher ratio of similar to 160 000 or more under Fe-limited conditions. The efficiency of CO2 drawdown during the several weeks of artificial fertilization experiments with concomitant observations is in the range of 100 < (CO2:Fe) < 1000 and is unknown in direction (positive or negative) and magnitude in the period after observations. The efficiency of biogenic carbon export into deeper water layers ranges from similar to 650 < (C:Fe)(export) < similar to 25 000 for reported export depths in the 100 to 250 m range. Variations in ocean initial conditions and variable weather during an experiment cause this range of similar to 2 orders of magnitude. Approximately 75\% of Fe added in fertilization experiments is lost very rapidly. Hence the above efficiencies can be multiplied 4-fold, to similar to 2600 < (C:Fe)(export) < similar to 100 000, for the sake of comparison with natural fertilization with Fe-organic complexes, which stabilize Fe in solution. Quantification of the Fe source of natural fertilization is difficult, leading to an export efficiency in the similar to 2400 < (C:Fe)(export) < similar to 800 000 range. Due to severe under-sampling, the existing datasets of artificial experiments and natural fertilizations may allow a wider range of alternative assessments than reported here.

TI  - The relative contribution of fast and slow sinking particles to ocean carbon export
AB  - Particulate organic carbon (POC) generated by primary production and exported to depth, is an important pathway for carbon transfer to the abyss, where it is stored over climatically significant timescales. These processes constitute the biological carbon pump. A spectrum of particulate sinking velocities exists throughout the water column, however numerical models often simplify this spectrum into suspended, fast and slow sinking particles. Observational studies suggest the spectrum of sinking speeds in the ocean is strongly bimodal with &gt;85% POC flux contained within two pools with sinking speeds of &lt;10 m day -1 and &gt;350 m day -1. We deployed a Marine Snow Catcher (MSC) to estimate the magnitudes of the suspended, fast and slow sinking pools and their fluxes at the Porcupine Abyssal Plain site (48Â°N, 16.5Â°W) in summer 2009. The POC concentrations and fluxes determined were 0.2Î¼ g C L -1 and 54 mg C m -2 day -1 for fast sinking particles, 5Î¼ g C L -1 and 92Î¼ mg C m -2 day -1 for slow sinking particles and 97 g C L -1 for suspended particles. Our flux estimates were comparable with radiochemical tracer methods and neutrally buoyant sediment traps. Our observations imply: (1) biomineralising protists, on occasion, act as nucleation points for aggregate formation and accelerate particle sinking; (2) fast sinking particles alone were sufficient to explain the abyssal POC flux; and (3) there is no evidence for ballasting of the slow sinking flux and the slow sinking particles were probably entirely remineralised in the twilight zone.

TI  - Controls over Ocean Mesopelagic Interior Carbon Storage (COMICS): Fieldwork, Synthesis, and Modeling Efforts
AB  - The ocean's biological carbon pump plays a central role in regulating atmospheric CO2 levels. In particular, the depth at which sinking organic carbon is broken down and respired in the mesopelagic zone is critical, with deeper remineralization resulting in greater carbon storage. Until recently, however, a balanced budget of the supply and consumption of organic carbon in the mesopelagic had not been constructed in any region of the ocean, and the processes controlling organic carbon turnover are still poorly understood. Large-scale data syntheses suggest that a wide range of factors can influence remineralization depth including upper-ocean ecological interactions, and interior dissolved oxygen concentration and temperature. However, these analyses do not provide a mechanistic understanding of remineralization, which increases the challenge of appropriately modeling the mesopelagic carbon dynamics. In light of this, the UK Natural Environment Research Council has funded a programme with this mechanistic understanding as its aim, drawing targeted fieldwork right through to implementation of a new parameterization for mesopelagic remineralization within an IPCC class global biogeochemical model. The Controls over Ocean Mesopelagic Interior Carbon Storage (COMICS) programme will deliver new insights into the processes of carbon cycling in the mesopelagic zone and how these influence ocean carbon storage. Here we outline the programme's rationale, its goals, planned fieldwork, and modeling activities, with the aim of stimulating international collaboration.

TI  - A reduced estimate of the strength of the ocean's biological carbon pump
AB  - A major term in the global carbon cycle is the ocean's biological carbon pump which is dominated by sinking of small organic particles from the surface ocean to its interior. Several different approaches to estimating the magnitude of the pump have been used, yielding a large range of estimates. Here, we use an alternative methodology, a thorium isotope tracer, that provides direct estimates of particulate organic carbon export. A large database of thorium-derived export measurements was compiled and extrapolated to the global scale by correlation with satellite sea surface temperature fields. Our estimates of export efficiency are significantly lower than those derived from the f-ratio, and we estimate global integrated carbon export as similar to 5 GtC yr(-1), lower than most current estimates. The lack of consensus amongst different methodologies on the strength of the biological carbon pump emphasises that our knowledge of a major planetary carbon flux remains incomplete.

TI  - Connections between climate, food limitation, and carbon cycling in abyssal sediment communities
AB  - Diverse faunal groups inhabit deep-sea sediments over much of Earth's surface, but our understanding of how interannual-scale climate variation alters sediment community components and biogeochemical processes remains limited. The vast majority of deep-sea communities depend on a particulate organic carbon food supply that sinks from photosynthetically active surface waters. Variations in food supply depend, in part, on surface climate conditions. Proposed ocean iron fertilization efforts are also intended to alter surface production and carbon export from surface waters. Understanding the ecology of the abyssal sediment community and constituent metazoan macrofauna is important because they influence carbon and nutrient cycle processes at the seafloor through remineralization, bioturbation, and burial of the sunken material. Results from a 10-year study in the abyssal NE Pacific found that climate-driven variations in food availability were linked to total metazoan macrofauna abundance, phyla composition, rank-abundance distributions, and remineralization over seasonal and interannual scales. The long-term analysis suggests that broad biogeographic patterns in deep-sea macrofauna community structure can change over contemporary timescales with changes in surface ocean conditions and provides significant evidence that sediment community parameters can be estimated from atmospheric and upper-ocean conditions. These apparent links between climate, the upper ocean, and deep-sea biogeochemistry need to be considered in determining the long-term carbon storage capacity of the ocean.

TI  - Ocean Upwelling System Utilizing Energy of Surface Waves
AB  - The upper ocean is an important component of climate and climate change. The heat capacity of only a few meters of the ocean is equivalent to the heat capacity of the entire atmosphere. (Solar radiation and IR balance in the atmosphere are of course major factors as well.) A large amount of cold water is available below the thermocline. Artificial upwelling devices can bring cold and nutrient rich water from below the thermocline, increase bio-productivity and cool down the sea surface and the air above. An analytical model and computational fluid dynamics simulation indicate high efficiency of the system. Wave-driven upwelling devices can modify climate on a local scale, and possibly help mitigate hurricanes to some extent.

TI  - Effects of Eddy-Driven Subduction on Ocean Biological Carbon Pump
AB  - Estimates of the ocean biological carbon pump are limited by uncertainties in the magnitude of the physical injection of particulate and dissolved organic carbon to the ocean interior. A major challenge is to evaluate the contribution of these physical pumps at small spatial and temporal scales (<100 km and <1 month). Here, we use a submesoscale permitting biophysical model covering a large domain representative of a subpolar and a subtropical gyre to quantify the impact of small-scale physical carbon pumps.The model successfully simulates intense eddy-driven subduction hot spots with a magnitude comparable to what has been observed in nature (1,000-6,000 mg C.m(-2).day(-1)). These eddy-driven subduction events are able to transfer carbon below the mixed-layer, down to 500- to 1,000-m depth. However, they contribute <5\% to the annual flux at the scale of the basin, due to strong compensation between upward and downward fluxes. The model also simulates hot spots of export associated with small-scale heterogeneity of the mixed layer, which intermittently export large amounts of suspended particulate and dissolved organic carbon. The mixed-layer pump contributes similar to 20\% to the annual flux. High-resolution measurements of export flux are needed to test models such as this one and to improve our mechanistic understanding of the biological pump and how it will respond to climate change.

TI  - Environmental, legal and social implications of ocean urea fertilization: Sulu sea example
AB  - Ocean urea fertilization is one geoengineering proposal aimed at not only reducing the atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide but also increasing fish populations in nutrient poor areas of the ocean. Theoretically ocean fertilization promises great benefits but there is also the possibility of serious environmental damage to consider. The nature of ocean urea fertilization means it is more likely to be carried out in coastal waters, providing States with different powers to enforce their laws compared to ocean iron fertilization which is more suitable to waters beyond national jurisdiction. This paper considers the process and effect urea, when used for the purpose of ocean fertilization, may have on the marine environment as well as the social implications, particularly for coastal and island people in developing nations.

TI  - Phytoplankton size-class contributions to new and regenerated production during the EXPORTS Northeast Pacific Ocean field deployment
AB  - The NASA EXport Processes in the Ocean from RemoTe Sensing (EXPORTS) program was established to better quantify the pathways of the biological carbon pump in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of global carbon export efficiency. The summer 2018 field campaign in the vicinity of Ocean Station Papa (Station P; 50 degrees N, 145 degrees W) in the Northeast Pacific Ocean yielded evidence of low phytoplankton biomass and primary productivity dominated by small cells (<5 mu m) that are reliant on recycled nutrients. Using combined C-13/N-15 stable isotope incubations, we calculated an average depth-integrated dissolved inorganic carbon uptake (net primary production) rate of 23.1 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) throughout the euphotic zone with small cells contributing 88.9\% of the total daily DIC uptake. Average depth-integrated NO3- uptake rates were 1.5 mmol N m(-2) d(-1) with small cells contributing 73.4\% of the total daily NO3- uptake. Estimates of new and regenerated production fluctuated, with small cells continuing to dominate both forms of production. The daily mixed-layer f-ratio ranged from 0.17 to 0.38 for the whole community, consistent with previous studies, which indicates a predominance of regenerated production in this region, with small and large cells (>= 5 mu m) having average f-ratios of 0.28 and 0.82, respectively. Peak phytoplankton biomass, total primary productivity and new production occurred between Julian Days 238 and 242 of our observation period, driven primarily by an increase in carbon and nitrate assimilation rates without apparent substantial shifts in the phytoplankton size-class structure. Our findings demonstrate the importance of small cells in performing the majority of net primary production and new production and the modest productivity fluctuations that occur in this iron-limited region of the Northeast Pacific Ocean, driven by ephemeral increases in new production, which could have significant ramifications for carbon export over broad timescales.

TI  - Evaluation of Biological Carbon Pump Metrics in the Subtropical Gulf of Aqaba, Northern Red Sea
AB  - The oceanic biological carbon pump modulates atmospheric CO2 concentrations by transporting carbon from the sunlit surface to greater depths. The efficiency of the biological pump and its response to warming temperatures are of great importance to future projections of global change. Here, we investigate a time series of organic carbon fluxes from a monthly resolved sediment trap mooring in the Gulf of Aqaba (GOA), northern Red Sea, between 2014 and 2016. We evaluate the attenuation of sinking organic carbon in the context of the seasonally changing euphotic zone and provide the first estimates of biological pump efficiency in this region. The base of the euphotic zone changed seasonally as the system transitioned from oligotrophic and stratified conditions in summer to mesotrophic conditions during the winter mixing period. Carbon attenuation assessed using a power law fit yields an average coefficient of b = 0.80 +/- 0.37, lower than expected based on the warm temperatures in the GOA. Estimates of export efficiency decreased from 40\% in summer to 20\% in winter, and show the opposite seasonal pattern as transfer efficiencies, which increased from 50\% in summer to similar to 95\% in winter. Overall, the efficiency of the carbon pump was close to similar to 20\% in both seasons. These observations challenge the notion of a globally uniform positive correlation between increasing temperature and increasing carbon attenuation in the ocean and imply that warm subtropical ecosystems can support moderately enhanced carbon pump efficiencies, possibly also related to increased, dust-driven, mineral ballasting in low latitude regions such as the GOA.

TI  - Robotic Observations of Enhanced Carbon Biomass and Export at 55Â°S during SOFeX
AB  - Autonomous floats profiling in high-nitrate low-silicate waters of the Southern Ocean observed carbon biomass variability and carbon exported to depths of 100 m during the 2002 Southern Ocean Iron Experiment (SOFeX) to detect the effects of iron fertilization of surface water there. Control and "in-patch" measurements documented a greater than fourfold enhancement of carbon biomass in the iron-amended waters. Carbon export through 100 m increased two- to sixfold as the patch subducted below a front. The molar ratio of iron added to carbon exported ranged between 104 and 10 5. The biomass buildup and export were much higher than expected for iron-amended low-silicate waters.

TI  - The Role of Zooplankton in Establishing Carbon Export Regimes in the Southern Ocean - A Comparison of Two Representative Case Studies in the Subantarctic Region
AB  - Marine ecosystems regulate atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by transporting and storing photosynthetically fixed carbon in the ocean's interior. In particular, the subantarctic and polar frontal zone of the Southern Ocean is a significant region for physically driven carbon uptake due to mode water formation, although it is under-studied concerning biologically mediated uptake. Regional differences in iron concentrations lead to variable carbon export from the base of the euphotic zone. Contrary to our understanding of export globally, where high productivity results in high export, naturally iron-fertilized regions exhibit low carbon export relative to their surface productivity, while HNLC (High Nutrient, Low Chlorophyll) waters emerge as a significant area for carbon export. Zooplankton, an integral part of the oceanic food web, play an important role in establishing these main carbon export regimes. In this mini review, we explore this role further by focusing on the impact of grazing and the production of fecal pellets on the carbon flux. The data coverage in the subantarctic region will be assessed by comparing two case studies - the iron-replete Kerguelen Plateau and the HNLC region south of Australia. We then discuss challenges in evaluating the contributions of zooplankton to carbon flux, namely gaps in seasonal coverage of sampling campaigns, the use of non-standardized and biased methods and under-sampling of the mesopelagic zone, an important area of carbon remineralization. More integrated approaches are necessary to improve present estimates of zooplankton-mediated carbon export in the Southern Ocean.

TI  - Concept design for artificial upwelling induced by natural forces
AB  - Conceptual designs of an underwater upwelling flexible pipe and a bellows pump are used to pump deep seawater by three natural forces solar heat, wind, and waves. For the solar heat, a parabolic collector and a Stirling engine are suggested as the means to convert solar energy into dynamic energy. It is estimated that a 20-30 m$+$/ collector may be enough to pump 1 CMS seawater from 300 m depth. A conventional wind mill can be selected to absorb wind energy. Six wind mills of 5 m diameter can have the same performance in a wind speed of 7 m/s, if the efficiency of the wind mill is 20%. A spar buoy is proposed to pump water by its heaving in waves. Six buoys of 1 m diameter can do the same job as the wind mills, with only 6% of the wave power is used. The buoy is cheaper and more reliable. Waves are suggested as the most promising natural force to generate an artificial upwelling.

The primary technical challenge of artificial upwelling is devising site-specific strategies to retain as much of the nutrients contained in deep ocean water at higher concentrations than the background for as long as possible in the photic zone. Recent experiments and analyses have helped to move the concept forward, but substantial work remains to be undertaken. Here, we discuss some long-time-horizon, large-scale concepts involving utilization of deep ocean water for energy and mariculture that could require or result in the geo-engineering of large areas in the ocean.

TI  - Building relationships between scientists and business in ocean iron fertilization
AB  - The potential use of ocean iron fertilization (OIF) as a tool for either carbon reduction projects like those used to generate carbon credits or offsets, or for larger-scale mitigation to remove a significant percentage of CO2 from the atmosphere has interested the private sector. Scientists have highlighted the additional research that must be completed to understand the efficacy and impact of OIF at either scale. Carbon markets also place requirements on the nature of the credits generated if they are to be trusted and valued. The challenge for the future is to find effective ways for the science, business and carbon market communities to collaborate in ways that adhere to the high standards of scientific research, A code of conduct that recognizes the needs for scientific excellence and transparency, carbon market quality controls, and regulatory requirements like permitting can facilitate collaboration.

TI  - The utilization of cold, nutrient-rich deep ocean water for energy and mariculture
AB  - In tropical and subtropical areas of the oceans, the warm surface waters constitute the world's largest storage of solar energy. The underlying cold deep water, less than 1,000 m below the ocean's surface, constitutes a cold sink, making it possible to generate mechanical energy by inserting a suitable heat engine between the warm and cold waters. The energy required for pumping the deep water to the surface is typically 6.5% of the total energy produced by the plant. The nitrate, phosphate and other nutrients dissolved in the deep sea water constitute the raw materials for plant growth when brought into the light at the surface. Extrapolation of results from small-scale experiments conducted at the St. Croix (U.S. Virgin Islands) "Artificial Upwelling" station, indicate that this system could produce 20 times more algal protein per hectare than alfalfa, the highest protein-producer per hectare in landbased agriculture. The algal protein can be converted into clam protein with better than 30% efficiency. It is recommended that a commercial feasibility test of a combined sea-thermal power plant and mariculture operation, utilizing deep-sea water and sunshine as major raw materials, be undertaken.

TI  - Phytoplankton strengthen CO2 uptake in the South Atlantic Ocean
AB  - The influence of phytoplankton groups on carbon dynamics was investigated during six oceanographic spring cruises (three cruises were carried out in 2009, and another three were conducted in 2011) between the western (Brazil) and eastern (Africa) South Atlantic margins. A seventh cruise crossed the South Atlantic during the early winter of 2015. Sea surface temperature and salinity, oceanic and atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)), chlorophyll a and other phytoplankton pigment data were gathered. Net CO2 fluxes were calculated for each cruise, characterizing the ability of each region to take up atmospheric CO2. We quantified phytoplankton chemotaxonomic groups using the HPLC/CHEMTAX approach. Thus, this study aimed to improve our understanding of the distribution of phytoplankton groups and their connection with the carbon biogeochemical cycle in the South Atlantic Ocean. Our results showed significant variations in both the zonal and meridional patterns of phytoplankton groups and the associated CO2 uptake magnitudes. Diatoms and haptophytes dominated the coastal regions of Brazil and Africa, respectively, whereas the open ocean was dominated by haptophytes and the picoplanktonic cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. The CO2 uptake capacity increased eastward from -7.1 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) on the Brazilian coast to 27.6 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) on the African coast. There was a significant negative relationship (p < 0.05) between the phytoplankton biomass and the difference in sea-air pCO(2) (Delta pCO(2)), with increasing CO2 uptake corresponding to increases in the biomasses of diatoms and haptophytes. Therefore, according to our analysis, haptophytes and diatoms were the main phytoplankton groups related to a high uptake of CO2 along the South Atlantic Ocean regions covered in this study. Thus, we encourage further investigations on their traits and vulnerabilities to future environmental change scenarios.

TI  - Sensing the ocean biological carbon pump from space: A review of capabilities, concepts, research gaps and future developments
AB  - The element carbon plays a central role in climate and life on Earth. It is capable of moving among the geosphere, cryosphere, atmosphere, biosphere and hydrosphere. This flow of carbon is referred to as the Earth's carbon cycle. It is also intimately linked to the cycling of other elements and compounds. The ocean plays a fundamental role in Earth's carbon cycle, helping to regulate atmospheric CO2 concentration. The ocean biological carbon pump (OBCP), defined as a set of processes that transfer organic carbon from the surface to the deep ocean, is at the heart of the ocean carbon cycle. Monitoring the OBCP is critical to understanding how the Earth's carbon cycle is changing. At present, satellite remote sensing is the only tool available for viewing the entire surface ocean at high temporal and spatial scales. In this paper, we review methods for monitoring the OBCP with a focus on satellites. We begin by providing an overview of the OBCP, defining and describing the pools of carbon in the ocean, and the processes controlling fluxes of carbon between the pools, from the surface to the deep ocean, and among ocean, land and atmosphere. We then examine how field measurements, from ship and autonomous platforms, complement satellite observations, provide validation points for satellite products and lead to a more complete view of the OBCP than would be possible from satellite observations alone. A thorough analysis is then provided on methods used for monitoring the OBCP from satellite platforms, covering current capabilities, concepts and gaps, and the requirement for uncertainties in satellite products. We finish by discussing the potential for producing a satellite-based carbon budget for the oceans, the advantages of integrating satellite-based observations with ecosystem models and field measurements, and future opportunities in space, all with a view towards bringing satellite observations into the limelight of ocean carbon research.

TI  - Predicting and verifying the intended and unintended consequences of large-scale ocean iron fertilization
AB  - Ocean iron fertilization (OIF) is being considered as a strategy for mitigating rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. One model for implementation is the sale of carbon offsets. Modeling studies predict that OIF has the potential to produce a material difference in the rise of atmospheric CO2 over the next several decades, but this could only be attained by alteration of the ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles of much of the world's oceans. The efficacy of OIF on this scale has not been proven. However, the consequences of successful implementation must be considered now, for 2 important reasons: (1) to determine if the environmental effects would be predictable and verifiable, and if so, acceptable; and (2) to establish whether the basis for valuing carbon offsets-an accurate audit of net reductions in cumulative greenhouse gas potential over 100 yr-can be met. Potential side-effects of widespread OIF that must be considered include a reduced supply of macronutrients to surface waters downstream of fertilized regions, increased emissions of the potent greenhouse gases nitrous oxide and methane, and changes in the extent or frequency of coastal hypoxia. Given the uncertainties inherent in ocean models, predictions of environmental effects must be backed up by measurements. Thus, to go forward with confidence that the effects of rising CO2 could indeed be mitigated through OIF over the next century, and to establish the foundations for auditing carbon offsets, it must be explicitly demonstrated that methods exist to predict and detect downstream effects of OIF against the background of both climate variability and global warming. We propose that until the side-effects of widespread OIF can be shown to be verifiable-and there is good reason to believe that they cannot - OIF should not be considered a viable technology for climate mitigation.

TI  - At-sea experiment on ocean-based artificial upwelling
AB  - In order to evaluate the effect of ocean-based artificial upwelling of nutrient-rich deep seawater on fertilization and to establish the design method on a self-sustaining, ocean-based mariculture-OTEC system, the behavior of the discharge plume was investigated by means of falling CTD, thermistor chain towing, optical fiber temperature sensor, measurements of nutrient concentrations and cultivation of phytoplankton. Moreover, a numerical simulation of the discharge plume and an ecosystem model of primary production were compared with experiments to evaluate the feasibility of an ocean-based artificial upwelling system. The behavior of the discharge plume (volume flow rate 0.9m3/s) was highly dependent upon sea current condition and was limited only about 20m-50m in width near surface.

However OIF will influence trace gas production and atmospheric emissions, with consequences over broad temporal and spatial scales. To illustrate this, the response of nitrous oxide (N2O) and dimethylsulphide (DMS) in the mesoscale iron addition experiments (FeAXs) and model scenarios of large-scale OIF are examined. FeAXs have shown negligible to minor increases in N2O production., whereas models of long-term OIF suggest significant N2O production with the potential to offset the benefit gained by iron-mediated increases in CO2 uptake. N2O production and emission will be influenced by the magnitude and rate of vertical particle export, and along-isopycnal N2O transport will necessitate monitoring over large spatial scales. The N2O-O-2 relationship provides a monitoring option using oxygen as a proxy, with spatial coverage by Argo and glider-mounted oxygen optodes. Although the initial FeAXs exhibited similar increases (1.5- to 1.6-fold) in DMS, a subsequent sub-arctic Pacific experiment observed DMS consumption relative to unfertilized waters, highlighting regional variability as a complicating factor when predicting the effects of large-scale OIF. DMS cycling and its influence on atmospheric composition may be studied using naturally occurring blooms and be constrained prior to OIF by pre-fertilization spatial mapping and aerial sampling using new technologies. As trace gases may have positive or negative synergistic effects on atmospheric chemistry and climate forcing, the net effect of altered trace gas emissions needs to be considered in both models and monitoring of large-scale OIF.

TI  - The impact on atmospheric CO2 of iron fertilization induced changes in the ocean's biological pump
AB  - Using numerical simulations, we quantify the impact of changes in the ocean's biological pump on the air-sea balance of CO2 by fertilizing a small surface patch in the high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll region of the eastern tropical Pacific with iron. Decade-long fertilization experiments are conducted in a basin-scale, eddy-permitting coupled physical/biogeochemical/ecological model. In contrast to previous studies, we find that most of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) removed from the euphotic zone by the enhanced biological export is replaced by uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere. Atmospheric uptake efficiencies, the ratio of the perturbation in air-sea CO2 flux to the perturbation in export flux across 100 m, integrated over 10 years, are 0.75 to 0.93 in our patch size-scale experiments. The atmospheric uptake efficiency is insensitive to the duration of the experiment. The primary factor controlling the atmospheric uptake efficiency is the vertical distribution of the enhanced biological production and export. Iron fertilization at the surface tends to induce production anomalies primarily near the surface, leading to high efficiencies. In contrast, mechanisms that induce deep production anomalies (e.g. altered light availability) tend to have a low uptake efficiency, since most of the removed DIC is replaced by lateral and vertical transport and mixing. Despite high atmospheric uptake efficiencies, patch-scale iron fertilization of the ocean's biological pump tends to remove little CO2 from the atmosphere over the decadal timescale considered here.

TI  - Preindustrial, historical, and fertilization simulations using a global ocean carbon model with new parameterizations of iron limitation, calcification, and N-2 fixation
AB  - The Canadian Model of Ocean Carbon (CMOC) has been developed as part of a global coupled climate carbon model. In a stand-alone integration to preindustrial equilibrium, the model ecosystem and global ocean carbon cycle are in general agreement with estimates based on observations. CMOC reproduces global mean estimates and spatial distributions of various indicators of the strength of the biological pump; the spatial distribution of the air-sea exchange of CO2 is consistent with present-day estimates. Agreement with the observed distribution of alkalinity is good, consistent with recent estimates of the mean rain ratio that are lower than historic estimates, and with calcification occurring primarily in the lower latitudes. With anthropogenic emissions and climate forcing from a 18502000 climate model simulation, anthropogenic CO2 accumulates at a similar rate and with a similar spatial distribution as estimated from observations. A hypothetical scenario for complete elimination of iron limitation generates maximal rates of uptake of atmospheric CO2 of less than 1 PgC y(-1), or about 11\% of 2004 industrial emissions. Even a `perfect' future of sustained fertilization would have a minor impact on atmospheric CO2 growth. In the long term, the onset of fertilization causes the ocean to take up an additional 77 PgC after several thousand years, compared with about 84 PgC thought to have occurred during the transition into the last glacial maximum due to iron fertilization associated with increased dust deposition.

TI  - CO2 sensitivity of Southern Ocean phytoplankton
AB  - The Southern Ocean exerts a strong impact on marine biogeochemical cycles and global air-sea CO2 fluxes. Over the coming century, large increases in surface ocean CO2 levels, combined with increased upper water column temperatures and stratification, are expected to diminish Southern Ocean CO2 uptake. These effects could be significantly modulated by concomitant CO2-dependent changes in the region's biological carbon pump. Here we show that CO2 concentrations affect the physiology, growth and species composition of phytoplankton assemblages in the Ross Sea, Antarctica. Field results from in situ sampling and ship-board incubation experiments demonstrate that inorganic carbon uptake, steady-state productivity and diatom species composition are sensitive to CO2 concentrations ranging from 100 to 800 ppm. Elevated CO2 led to a measurable increase in phytoplankton productivity, promoting the growth of larger chain-forming diatoms. Our results suggest that CO2 concentrations can influence biological carbon cycling in the Southern Ocean, thereby creating potential climate feedbacks.

TI  - Glacial CO2 decrease and deep-water deoxygenation by iron fertilization from glaciogenic dust
AB  - Increased accumulation of respired carbon in the deep ocean associated with enhanced efficiency of the biological carbon pump is thought to be a key mechanism of glacial CO2 drawdown. Despite greater oxygen solubility due to seawater cooling, recent quantitative and qualitative proxy data show glacial deep-water deoxygenation, reflecting increased respired carbon accumulation. However, the mechanisms of deep-water deoxygenation and contribution from the biological pump to glacial CO2 drawdown have remained unclear. In this study, we report the significance of iron fertilization from glaciogenic dust in glacial CO2 decrease and deep-water deoxygenation using our numerical simulation, which successfully reproduces the magnitude and large-scale pattern of the observed oxygen changes from the present to the Last Glacial Maximum. Sensitivity experiments show that physical changes contribute to only one-half of all glacial deep deoxygenation, whereas the other one-half is driven by iron fertilization and an increase in the whole ocean nutrient inventory. We find that iron input from glaciogenic dust with higher iron solubility is the most significant factor in enhancing the biological pump and deep-water deoxygenation. Glacial deep-water deoxygenation expands the hypoxic waters in the deep Pacific and Indian oceans. The simulated global volume of hypoxic waters is nearly double the present value, suggesting that glacial deep water was a more severe environment for benthic animals than that of the modern oceans. Our model underestimates the deoxygenation in the deep Southern Ocean because of enhanced ventilation. The model-proxy comparison of oxygen change suggests that a stratified Southern Ocean is required for reproducing the oxygen decrease in the deep Southern Ocean. Iron fertilization and a global nutrient increase contribute to a decrease in glacial CO2 of more than 30 ppm, which is supported by the model-proxy agreement of oxygen change. Our findings confirm the significance of the biological pump in glacial CO2 drawdown and deoxygenation.

TI  - Ocean iron fertilization in the context of the Kyoto protocol and the post-Kyoto process
AB  - Ocean iron fertilization is currently discussed as a potential measure to mitigate climate change by enhancing oceanic CO2 uptake. Its mitigation potential is not yet well explored, and carbon offsets generated through iron fertilization activities could currently not be traded on regulated carbon markets. Still, commercial interests in ocean iron fertilization already exist, which underlines the need to investigate a possible regulatory framework for it. To this end, I first discuss important basic aspects of ocean iron fertilization, namely its scientific background, quantitative potential, side effects, and costs. In a second step, I review regulatory aspects connected to ocean iron fertilization, like its legal status and open access issues. Moreover, I analyze how the regulations for afforestation and reforestation activities within the framework of the Kyoto Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) could be applied to ocean iron fertilization. Main findings are that the quantitative potential of ocean iron fertilization is limited, that costs are higher than initially hoped, and that potential adverse side effects are severe. Moreover, the legal status of ocean iron fertilization is currently not well defined, open access might cause inefficiencies, and the CDM regulations could not be easily applied to ocean iron fertilization.

TI  - Robotic observations of dust storm enhancement of carbon biomass in the North Pacific
AB  - Two autonomous robotic pro ling oats deployed in the subarctic North Pacific on 10 April 2001 provided direct records of carbon biomass variability from surface to 1000 meters below surface at daily and diurnal time scales. Eight months of real-time data documented the marine biological response to natural events, including hydrographic changes, multiple storms, and the April 2001 dust event. High-frequency observations of upper ocean particulate organic carbon variability show a near doubling of biomass in the mixed layer over a 2-week period after the passage of a cloud of Gobi desert dust. The temporal evolution of particulate organic carbon enhancement and an increase in chlorophyll use efficiency after the dust storm suggest a biotic response to a natural iron fertilization by the dust.

TI  - Reviews of power supply and environmental energy conversions for artificial upwelling
AB  - Wave energy is being increasingly regarded as a major and promising resource since the artificial upwelling was invented. There are many different ways to convert wave energy to electricity and some other energy such as the power supply for artificial upwelling in this paper. An overview of wave energy converters in artificial upwelling application as well as the power systems and environmental energy conversions for the artificial upwelling all over the world is given in this article. Some basic principles are present, assessment and advices are shown for each category. Some suggestions of the outlook of power systems and wave energy converters in air-lift artificial upwelling application are also given. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Dynamics of large diameter riser
AB  - Structural analysis and material selection for an intake riser pipe with a large diameter in an artificial upwelling system are performed. The most suitable material of a riser pipe for intake of a large amount of deep seawater is selected through the consideration and estimation for a commercial pipe with a larger diameter than 1m in minimum. From an evaluation of pipe materials, a GFRP pipe is appraised to be the best for a riser pipe with a large diameter. An eigenvalue and structural analyses for a GFRP pipe with the numerical method are carried out to understand the characteristic of the dynamic behaviour. From the modal analysis the basic behaviour property of two types of the riser structures is investigated. For a low density and large diameter riser, such as HDPE pipe, with a buffer, it is found that the total added mass of a riser is so large that a buffer attached at the low end of a riser does not affect the behaviour of a riser. The basic dynamic behaviour properties of a GFRP pipe are found to be excellent in the eigenvalue analysis as 1st and 2 n natural periods for a GFRP pipe deviate from the high energy domain of wave. The results show in the static analysis that it should be increased a weight or modified the design of GFRP pipe to maintain a limit water depth of its end of a GFRP pipe under the sea condition of faster than 1.5m/s of the current speed. The combined stress distributed along the riser pipe under both the wave force and top excitation by upper structure is the largest in the condition of 15 second of wave period. But the maximum stress along the riser pipe is found to be smaller than the allowable stress of a GFRP pipe. Therefore, GFRP pipe can be recommended to the candidate material to develop a large diameter riser pipe. Â© 2010 by The International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).

TI  - Technology, Gender, and Climate Change: A Feminist Examination of Climate Technologies
AB  - In this article, I examine the subject of justice as it relates to gender and climate change by focusing on two specific strategies, namely, the geoengineering strategy of ocean fertilization, and renewable energy as a means of mitigation (where mitigation is understood as the adoption of technologies and practices that aim to slow the rise of greenhouse gas emissions). My overarching argument is that iron fertilization geoengineering is not consistent with the feminist values of justice embedded in feminist standpoint theory and feminist contextual empiricism. Alternative mitigation strategies, on the other hand, go much further in meeting these objectives and virtues.

TI  - Ocean upwelling system utilizing energy of surface waves
AB  - The upper ocean is an important component of climate and climate change. The heat capacity of only a few meters of the ocean is equivalent to the heat capacity of the entire atmosphere. (Solar radiation and IR balance in the atmosphere are of course major factors as well.) A large amount of cold water is available below the thermocline. Artificial upwelling devices can bring cold and nutrient rich water from below the thermocline, increase bio-productivity and cool down the sea surface and the air above. An analytical model and computational fluid dynamics simulation indicate high efficiency of the system. Wave-driven upwelling devices can modify climate on a local scale, and possibly help mitigate hurricanes to some extent. Â© 2016 IEEE.

TI  - CO2 drawdown due to particle ballasting by glacial aeolian dust: An estimate based on the ocean carbon cycle model MPIOM/HAMOCC version 1.6.2p3
AB  - Despite intense efforts, the mechanisms that drive glacial-interglacial changes in atmospheric <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula"><i>p</i>CO2</span> are not fully understood. Here, we aim at quantifying the potential contribution of aeolian dust deposition changes to the atmospheric <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula"><i>p</i>CO2</span> drawdown during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). To this end, we use the Max Planck Institute Ocean Model (MPIOM) and the embedded Hamburg Ocean Carbon Cycle model (HAMOCC), including a new parameterization of particle ballasting that accounts for the acceleration of sinking organic soft tissue in the ocean by higher-density biogenic calcite and opal particles, as well as mineral dust. Sensitivity experiments with reconstructed LGM dust deposition rates indicate that the acceleration of detritus by mineral dust played a small role in atmospheric <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula"><i>p</i>CO2</span> variations during glacial-interglacial cycles - on the order of 5&thinsp;ppmv, compared to the reconstructed <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">Ä1/480</span>&thinsp;ppmv rise in atmospheric <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula"><i>p</i>CO2</span> during the last deglaciation. The additional effect of the LGM dust deposition, namely the enhanced fertilization by the iron that is associated with the glacial dust, likely played a more important role; although the full iron fertilization effect can not be estimated in the particular model version used here due to underestimated present-day non-diazotroph iron limitation, fertilization of diazotrophs in the tropical Pacific already leads to an atmospheric pCO2 drawdown of around 10 ppmv.

TI  - Investigating the Nutrient Landscape in a Coastal Upwelling Region and Its Relationship to the Biological Carbon Pump
AB  - We investigated nutrient patterns and their relationship to vertical carbon export using results from 38 Lagrangian experiments in the California Current Ecosystem. The dominant mode of variability reflected onshore-offshore nutrient gradients. A secondary mode of variability was correlated with silica excess and dissolved iron and likely reflects regional patterns of iron limitation. The biological carbon pump was enhanced in high-nutrient and Fe-stressed regions. Patterns in the nutrient landscape proved to be better predictors of the vertical flux of sinking particles than contemporaneous measurements of net primary production. Our results suggest an important role for Fe-stressed diatoms in vertical carbon flux. They also suggest that either preferential recycling of N or non-Redfieldian nutrient uptake by diatoms may lead to high PO43-:NO3- and Si(OH)(4):NO3- ratios, following export of P- and Si-enriched organic matter. Increased export following Fe stress may partially explain inverse relationships between net primary productivity and export efficiency. Plain Language Summary The productivity of marine ecosystems is limited by the availability of macronutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and trace elements (iron) in the sunlit surface ocean. The ocean's ability to absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide through the ``biological carbon pump{''} is further constrained by the rates at which oceanic upwelling naturally fertilizes the surface ocean with ``new{''} nitrogen contained in nutrient-rich deep water. We investigated patterns in nutrient distributions during 38 experiments in the California Current Ecosystem. In these experiments, we followed biological communities as they were transported with the currents and measured nutrients, primary productivity, and the export of organic carbon contained in sinking particles. Our results indicate that nutrient concentrations may be a useful predictor of rates of carbon export and that iron stress increased the efficiency with which organic carbon created by algae is transported to the deep ocean. This increased carbon export efficiency likely results from physiological changes within diatoms that lead to thicker silica shells relative to organic carbon content.

TI  - Role of marine biology in glacial-interglacial CO2 cycles
AB  - It has been hypothesized that changes in the marine biological pump caused a major portion of the glacial reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide by 80 to 100 parts per million through increased iron fertilization of marine plankton, increased ocean nutrient content or utilization, or shifts in dominant plankton types. We analyze sedimentary records of marine productivity at the peak and the middle of the last glacial cycle and show that neither changes in nutrient utilization in the Southern Ocean nor shifts in plankton dominance explain the CO2 drawdown. Iron fertilization and associated mechanisms can be responsible for no more than half the observed drawdown.

TI  - Air-sea disequilibrium enhances ocean carbon storage during glacial periods
AB  - The prevailing hypothesis for lower atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations during glacial periods is an increased efficiency of the ocean's biological pump. However, tests of this and other hypotheses have been hampered by the difficulty to accurately quantify ocean carbon components. Here, we use an observationally constrained earth system model to precisely quantify these components and the role that different processes play in simulated glacial-interglacial CO2 variations. We find that air-sea disequilibrium greatly amplifies the effects of cooler temperatures and iron fertilization on glacial ocean carbon storage even as the efficiency of the soft-tissue biological pump decreases. These two processes, which have previously been regarded as minor, explain most of our simulated glacial CO2 drawdown, while ocean circulation and sea ice extent, hitherto considered dominant, emerge as relatively small contributors.

TI  - Development of Air-lifted Artificial Upwelling Powered by Wave
AB  - this paper presents that an artificial upwelling system integrated with air-lift upwelling tube and wave powered air booster. The upwelling flow had proved that the air-water mixture flow upward in upwelling tube immersed water can make the underwater at bottom flow upward too. This paper introduces the wave power to collect and pump air into water in one depth of upwelling tube. Meanwhile in the deep water far from the continent, the nutrition concentration near the seabed is higher than that near the surface of sea. On the contrary, the oxygen concentration near the seabed is less than that on the top. The upwelling flow is an available method to balance or decrease the difference of characters between surface and bottom water in the sea, which can improve the environment of marine ranching, and promote the growth of the bottom of the biological food chain. One project - air-lifted artificial upwelling powered by wave had been applied and carried on. In order to confirm the air-lifted upwelling efficiency, 2 lake experiments were finished in Qiandao Lake, The first experiment was done directly with a plastic hose, while at the second experiment, the upwelling tube made of tensional cloth is supported by steel supporting rings, these experiments showed that the efficiency of upwelling flow of the plastic hose is higher than that of upwelling tube with supporting rings, an upwelling tube shrinkage deformation happens easily in the case of large upwelling flow. In addition, a simulation platform was designed and numerical simulated, which simulate the wave lifting and dropping the buoyant ball then get compressed air, whose aim is to get the performance of air collecting and compressing capacity and the efficiency between the hydraulic power and compressed air power.

TI  - Mechanisms and pathways of small-phytoplankton export from the surface ocean
AB  - Carbon fixation by phytoplankton near the surface and the sinking of this particulate material to deeper waters are key components of the biological carbon pump. The efficiency of the biological pump is influenced by the size and taxonomic composition of the phytoplankton community. Large, heavily ballasted taxa such as diatoms sink quickly and thus efficiently remove fixed carbon from the upper ocean. Smaller, nonballasted species such as picoplanktonic cyanobacteria are usually thought to contribute little to export production. Research in the past decade, however, has shed new light on the potential importance of small phytoplankton to carbon export, especially in oligotrophic oceans, where small cells dominate primary productivity. Here, I examine the mechanisms and pathways through which small-phytoplankton carbon is exported from the surface ocean and the role of small phytoplankton in food webs of a variety of ocean ecosystems.

TI  - Simulation of an artificial upwelling using immersed in situ phytoplankton microcosms
AB  - The inflow of deep seawater in the surface layer by an Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) plant will generate artificial upwelling. In order to study the potential impact on biogeochemical processes that could result, in situ microcosms were designed to simulate seawater plant discharge and these were deployed off the Caribbean coast of Martinique. Seawater was collected in ultra-clean conditions at maximum chlorophyll a concentrations (45 m depth). The water was then mixed with either 2% or 10% deep seawater (1100 m depth) and put in 2.3 L polycarbonate bottles. These microcosms were immersed for 6 days at 45 m depth on a 220 m mooring. Samples from the surrounding environment and from the microcosms were analyzed by pigment quantification, counting of picophytoplankton groups and macronutrient analyses. Similar trends in the evolutions of the phytoplankton populations were observed over time between the control microcosms (without addition of deep seawater) and the surrounding environment, suggesting that these microcosms can be used as a realistic representation of the natural surrounding waters over a 6-day incubation period. Microcosm enrichment with 10% deep seawater induced a shift in the phytoplankton assemblage towards the development of diatoms, haptophytes, and Prochlorococcus, whereas 2% enrichment only led to an increase in the Prochlorococcus population.
