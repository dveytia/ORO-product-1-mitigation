TI  - NOAA and BOEM Minimum Recommendations for Use of Passive Acoustic Listening Systems in Offshore Wind Energy Development Monitoring and Mitigation Programs
AB  - Offshore wind energy development is rapidly ramping up in United States (U.S.) waters in order to meet renewable energy goals. With a diverse suite of endangered large whale species and a multitude of other protected marine species frequenting these same waters, understanding the potential consequences of construction and operation activities is essential to advancing responsible offshore wind development. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) represents a newer technology that has become one of several methods of choice for monitoring trends in the presence of species, the soundscape, mitigating risk, and evaluating potential behavioral and distributional changes resulting from offshore wind activities. Federal and State regulators, the offshore wind industry, and environmental advocates require detailed information on PAM capabilities and techniques needed to promote efficient, consistent, and meaningful data collection efforts on local and regional scales. PAM during offshore wind construction and operation may be required by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management through project-related permits and approvals issued pursuant to relevant statutes and regulations. The recommendations in this paper aim to support this need as well as to aid the development of project-specific PAM Plans by identifying minimum procedures, system requirements, and other important components for inclusion, while promoting consistency across plans. These recommendations provide an initial guide for stakeholders to meet the rapid development of the offshore wind industry in United States waters. Approaches to PAM and agency requirements will evolve as future permits are issued and construction plans are approved, regional research priorities are refined, and scientific publications and new technologies become available.

TI  - Optimization of electrical connection scheme for large offshore wind farm with genetic algorithm
AB  - Offshore wind farms have great potential as large-scale sustainable energy sources for the production of electricity. Utilization of offshore wind farms requires a reliable and efficient transmission system. The increased interest in offshore wind farms accentuates the need to focus attention on the economic issues of the electrical system. Based on analysis of existing offshore wind farm schemes and the investment cost of electrical components, optimization model is proposed and explained in this paper. An optimization approach based on genetic algorithm is presented to search for the optimum connection scheme. A calculation example shows that the differences among different electric connection schemes are evident, and by use of genetic algorithm the optimal connection scheme can be found effectively.

TI  - DOE-ANOVA to Optimize Hydrokinetic Turbines for Low Velocity Conditions
AB  - The need of reducing the dependence of fossil fuels and CO2 emissions have motivated the diversification of energy matrix. Among the Renewables, the hydropower shows better characteristics compared to solar, wind, biomass and geothermal, because its low CO2 emissions, higher density and others technical factors. Within the Hydropower, the Hydrokinetic turbines (HT) are considered as a promising technology because can provide electricity during low flow velocity conditions (&lt; 2 m/s) and is able to operate in shallow waters &lt; 8 m and in secluded areas without access to the energy network. In this sense, the present study incentivizes the research in Hydropower and proposes and new application of DOE-ANOVA combined with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling for the HT design and optimization. Accordingly, this work evaluated the performance of a HT with 1.9 m of rotor diameter operating in a water flow of 1.5 m/s through a 23 factorial design with 9 modelling cases (MC). The results showed that the increment of outlet diameters increased the downstream velocity and the hydrodynamic pressure over the HT, and the reduction of the blade tip edge distance generated an increment of the response of the HT hydraulic and mechanical properties.

TI  - Winds of change
AB  - Wind energy as a renewable resource holds great potential to the Great Britain, which if completely exploited could supply the electricity needs of the country needs three times over. Npower has a dedicated renewable division, which is taking the challenge of producing green energy very seriously. The company aims to have 20% of electricity generated from renewable sources by 2020, though the bureaucracy is stifling about what should be a thriving British wind energy industry. The country has some good projects in the planning process to surpass the 2015 target of 15%, but if the government is serious about meeting its commitments, it has to accelerator the planning process. Onshore farms produces more power than their newer offshore counterparts, which are dogged by high rates of refusal and tend to grind to a halt in the planning system as local residents object to their construction and visual impact.

TI  - Wind energy planning for a sustainable transition to a decarbonized generation scenario based on the opportunity cost of the wind energy: Spanish Iberian Peninsula as case study
AB  - Most countries in Europe are going under a significant transformation process from carbonized power energy sources to renewable and sustainable ones to feed their increasing demands. European Union targets on its energy roadmap states that by 2030, a reduction of 40\% of CO2 emissions regarding the 1990 levels must be done and full transition must be completed by 2050. Thus, EU member countries, such Spain, are carrying out lots of investments to transform their power generation structure by promoting the installation of renewable energy power plants, with a significant visual and environmental impact. In the case of Spain, it is planned that, by 2030, 27\% of final power consumption must be renewable, with approximately 31 GW of installed wind energy (8 GW must be installed in the next 10 years). Wind energy is supposed to be one of the generation leaders in this transformation context due to its high performance, high availability and fast decreasing costs. Nevertheless, wind farms have been installed on-shore with great success since the decade of the 90s covering the locations with the best wind resource. Thus, many of the installed wind turbines have overcome the half part of their expected lifespan and their payback periods, but the learning curve of the wind energy technology has improved exponentially since then. This paper is focused on the true valorization of an existing wind farm and the efficacy of the exploitation of the site's wind resource. A novel repowering decision support model based on the opportunity cost analysis between repowering the current wind farm with the latter technologies and full depletion of the wind farm is proposed and applied to the Spanish Iberian Peninsula case study. Results show that the repowering option is significantly attractive in most cases and its proper application could have, not only a positive environmental effect, but also an economic impact on the sustainability of this source of energy.

TI  - Northern gannets (Morus bassanus) are strongly affected by operating offshore wind farms during the breeding season
AB  - Northern gannets (Morus bassanus) have been ranked as one of the most vulnerable species in terms of collision with offshore wind farm (OWF) turbines, and strong avoidance of OWFs has been documented for this species. Gannets increasingly encounter OWFs within the ranges of their largest breeding colonies along the European coasts. However, information on their actual reactions to OWFs during the breeding season is lacking. We investigated the possible effects of OWFs located 23â€“35 km north of the colony on Helgoland in the southern North Sea on breeding gannets. GPS tags were applied to 28 adult gannets breeding on Helgoland for several weeks over 2 years. Most gannets (89%) predominantly avoided the OWFs in both years, but 11% frequently entered them when foraging or commuting between the colony and foraging areas. Flight heights inside the OWFs were close to the rotor-blade zone, especially for individuals predominantly avoiding the OWFs. Gannets preferred distances of 250â€“450 m to the turbines when being inside the OWF. A point process modelling approach revealed that the gannets resource selection of the OWF area compared with the surroundings (outside OWF = up to 15 km from the OWF border) was reduced by 21% in 2015 and 37% in 2016. This study provides the first detailed characterisation of individual reactions of gannets to OWFs during the breeding season and one of the first comprehensive studies of OWF effects on this species based on telemetry data. The documented effects need to be considered during the planning processes for future OWFs, especially those located close to large seabird breeding colonies. Â© 2020 The Author(s)

TI  - Design and testing of a low-cost, self-contained wave energy converter device
AB  - This paper introduces the design and testing of a scalable, low-cost, self-contained WEC device that can be easily deployed in remote, undeveloped locations around the world. This novel design relies on a two-way mechanical rectifier and flywheel system to convert opposing angular into single-directional turning of the dynamo. In effect, this device is able to harness energy from virtually all wave-induced motion. The design can be implemented as a shoreline, nearshore, or offshore device with minimal modification and without need for permanent supporting structure. Another unique characteristic of the design is that all components are fully contained inside the device itself. This feature significantly increases robustness of the device and virtually eliminates the need for regular maintenance. The device's construction leverage off-the-shelf components that are widely available in order to minimize cost. A prototype is tested at a fishing community with a relatively inconsistent and low level of wave activities. Experimental results demonstrate that a relatively small prototype operating in calm wave conditions can provide basic lighting and emergency power where electricity is not yet available.

TI  - From wind ensembles to probabilistic information about future wind power production - Results from an actual application
AB  - Meteorological ensemble forecasts aim at quantifying the uncertainty of the future development of the weather by-supplying several possible scenarios of this development. Here we address the use of such scenarios in probabilistic forecasting of wind power production. Specifically, for each forecast horizon we aim at supplying quantiles of the wind power production conditional on the information available at the time at which the forecast is generated. This involves (i) transformation of meteorological ensemble forecasts into wind power ensemble forecasts and (ii) calculation of quantiles based on the wind power ensemble forecasts. Given measurements of power production, representing a region or a single wind farm, we have developed methods applicable for these two steps. While (ii) should in principle be a simple task we found that the probabilistic information contained in the wind power ensembles from (i) can not be used directly and therefore both (i) and (ii) requires statistical modelling. Based on these findings an demo-application, supplying quantitÃ© forecasts for operational horizons of up to approximately 6 days, was developed for two utilities participating in a common project. The application use ECMWF-ensembles. One setup corresponds to an offshore wind farm (Nysted, Denmark) and one corresponds to regional forecasting (Western Denmark). In the paper we analyze the results obtained from 8 months of actual operation of this system. It is concluded that the demo-application produce reliable forecasts. The average difference between the 75% and 25% quantile forecasts exceeds 50% of the installed capacity for horizons longer than approximately 4 days for the wind farm setup. For the regional forecasts the corresponding horizon is not reached within 7 days, which is the maximum horizon available. The ability of the demo-application to differentiate between situations with low and high uncertainty is analysed. Also, the relation between the forecasted uncertainty and the actual skill of a point forecast is analysed. A satisfactory agreement is observed. Â© Copyright KTH 2006.

TI  - Compact floating wave energy converters arrays: Mooring loads and survivability through scale physical modelling
AB  - The current cost of electricity has been preventing the technological progress of wave energy converters. The use of compact wave energy converters arrays is seen as a technological breakthrough for reducing these costs. These array configurations aim to maximize the energy extracted per unit area of marine space and to promote the sharing of components and installation, operation and maintenance tasks. Mooring lines are fundamental components in these systems and represent a considerable portion of the project cost. Reducing the number of mooring lines through the application of arrays with inter-body connections has a high potential for cost reduction. In this paper, we present the experimental study of different configurations of a five-device array of spar-buoy oscillating-water-column wave energy converters in a wave basin, focusing on the analysis of the devices motion and the mooring line loads. The study compares the performance of a single isolated device, an array with independently-moored devices and three arrays with inter-body connections, with different levels of connectivity in the mooring arrangement. Tests were carried out for moderate and extreme wave conditions. Results show good performance for all configurations when subjected to moderate sea conditions. Under extreme sea conditions, high peak tensions were observed in the lines of all array configurations. Particularly large values were detected in the inter-body lines, caused by their full extension. Based on these results, guidelines for the design of mooring systems for compact wave energy converter arrays are presented.

TI  - A data-driven vessel motion model for offshore access forecasting
AB  - Access forecasting for offshore wind farm operations is concerned with the prediction of conditions during transfer of personnel between offshore structures and vessels. Currently dispatch/scheduling decisions are typically made on the basis of single-valued forecasts of significant wave height from a numerical weather prediction model. The aim of this study is to move beyond the significant wave height metric using a data-driven methodology to estimate vessel motion during transfer. This is because turbine access is constrained by the behaviour of crew transfer vessels and the transition piece in the local wave climate. Using generalised additive models for location, scale, and shape, we map the relationship between measured vessel heave motion and measured wave conditions in terms of significant wave height, peak wave period, and peak wave direction. This is explored via a case study where measurements are collected via vessel telemetry and an on-site wave buoy during the construction phase of an east coast offshore wind farm in the UK. Different model formulations are explored and the best performing trained model, in terms of the Akaike Information Criterion, is defined. Operationally, this model is driven by temporal scenario forecasts of the input wave buoy measurements to estimate the vessel motion during transfer up to 5 days ahead. Â© 2019 IEEE.

AB  - This study considered one offshore wind turbine prototype as the research object, and its structural vibration responses under standstill, normal operational, startup, shutdown, and typhoon conditions were obtained through field measurement. First, the variation characteristics of the vibration responses under different operational conditions are examined systematically through time and frequency domain analyses. Furthermore, the key factors influencing structural vibration and their influence rules on the vibration safety of offshore wind turbine are explained clearly. Results show that the structural vibration increases with the increase in wind speed when the wind turbine operates under the standstill condition. The research results also show that the rotation speed of the blades has an obvious influence on structural vibration and plays a dominant role during vibration under the normal operational condition. Thereafter, the structural vibration of offshore wind turbine under the transition process of the startup(shutdown) condition is significantly greater than that under the normal operational condition with the same variables. Simultaneously, the observed vibration under the typhoon condition with rated rotation speed exceeds the corresponding responses under the standstill condition with maximum measured wind speed. Finally, the synchronization of the vibration responses measured from the tower and foundation indicates that the overall structure has good deformation coordination.

TI  - Use of a model turbine to investigate the high striking risk of fish with tidal and oceanic current turbine blades under slow rotational speed
AB  - The turbine blades of marine renewable energy devices pose a striking/collision risk to marine species. Consequently, where a proposed site contains a major fishery, there can be conflicts with local fishermen and stakeholders. Meanwhile, the striking/collision risk is considered low based on data from tidal power generation test sites. There are some unknown aspects due to a lack of observational data, in particular, the data that indicates direct striking. Therefore, this paper attempts to show an example how fishes strike turbine blades even though the rotating blades are slower than fish swimming speed. A preliminary experiment was carried out in a laboratory-scale water tank using the fish Gnathopogon elongatus. The fish is distorted by the current and sometimes distracts the rotating turbine blades. Thus, the fish had a high risk of striking the turbine on several occasions, suggesting that they may strike the turbine if they lose their cautiousness of it. The experiment showed that fishes such as Gnathopogon elongatus, which can be considered abnormal in some situations, may have an approximately 1% chance of striking turbine blades in the water tank test although they would have the ability to avoid the slow rotating turbine blades under the normal situation.

TI  - Wind energy analysis in the coastal region of bangladesh
AB  - Diversifying the energy mix of Bangladesh is becoming indispensable not only to improve its energy security, but also for a more sustainable economic development. This study focused on mapping the wind potential of southern coastal areas of Bangladesh to estimate the wind energy potential, along with the reduction in carbon emissions due to wind energy. Analysis of the carbon footprint was based on the annual energy production (AEP) from the selected low-wind turbine generators (WTGs). The time series-measured and-predicted wind data were incorporated with the high-resolution mesoscale and microscale wind re-source mapping technique at 60, 80, and 100 m above ground level (AGL). Coupling mesoscale and microscale modeling provided reliable mapping results for the commercially exploitable wind resource and was verified by ground-based wind measurement. The results revealed that, among the selected areas, two sites named Charfashion and Monpura have a promising annual mean wind speed of 7.3 m/s at 100 m AGL for energy generation. Different WTGs with ranges of 1â€“3.3 MW were used to estimate the wind energy generation capacity at different sites in the study area. A WTG with a 1 MW wind energy generation capacity installed at 60 m AGL in the selected site has the potential to produce 2.79 GWh/year of clean energy, reducing 1781.689 tons of CO2 per year, whereas a 3.3 MW WTG at 80 m AGL can produce 18.99 GWh/year of energy, reducing 12,098.54 tons of CO2 per year, and a 1.6 MW WTG at 100 m AGL produces 11.04 GWh/year of energy, cutting 7035.028 tons of CO2 per year. With its reliable scientific and time-tested wind energy estimation method, this research is very important for the development of wind energy in the southern coastal areas of Bangladesh to meet the increasing energy demands through initiating the development of renewable energy to improve the energy security and reduce the carbon emissions of the country.

AB  - Aiming at coordination control and revenue distribution for a wind power cluster joint shared energy storage system, an operational control strategy based on the principle of prediction error distribution is proposed. A commercial operation mode of shared energy storage is designed, and the variable life and charge-discharge of energy storage is established. Considering the influence of policy subsidies and seasonal temperature on energy storage pricing and capacity allocation, a capacity planning model of wind groups participating in the energy/frequency modulation market with large-capacity shared energy storage is established. Using the proposed strategy, the optimal energy storage capacity allocation of the wind-storage combined system is calculated, and the difference of seasonal wind conditions on energy storage allocation is analyzed through examples. The results show that the proposed business model can obtain stable profits without subsidies, and meet the requirements of wind power cluster grid connection, and control the wind abandonment rate within 5%; this method, based on the principle of error distribution, can balance the benefits of each wind farm, and considering seasonal factors, the actual benefits of energy storage can be increased by about 3.6%, and its configuration presents a double inverse ratio phenomenon, which provides a reference for the large-scale application of shared energy storage on the power generation side.

TI  - The Buhl correction factor applied to high induction conditions for tidal stream turbines
AB  - Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT) is a computationally efficient method of calculating the performance of a tidal stream turbine (TST) generating energy from the ocean. This efficiency is achieved by making several simplifying assumptions; an unintended consequence of these assumptions is the omission of some phenomena that can significantly alter the performance and loads of a TST. We can ameliorate this by incorporating suitable corrections into a BEMT model, which allow us to account for some of the effects of these phenomena. This paper examines the implementation of corrections in an established BEMT solver for two such phenomena: tip/hub losses and high induction conditions. Tip losses are attributable to the flow of fluid around end of the blade, a flow feature omitted in the classical BEMT treatment of turbines. At high tip speed ratios, above the designed operating range of the device, the theory based on an axial interference factor, a, diverges from experimental results and, indeed, becomes physically untenable. Buhl proposed a high induction correction factor for wind turbines operating in air and a modified version of his correction is implemented here for a TST operating in water. The tip/hub loss and high-induction corrections are well-integrated with one another. The validity of the high-induction correction is checked against experimental results; we find that our model predicts power output well but overpredicts axial thrust compared to laboratory observations.

TI  - The Potential of Wind Energy and Design Implications on Wind Farms in Saudi Arabia
AB  - Climate change and natural resource depletion are likely to affect the future economic development of a country. The generation of power from oil and gas is among the major causes of reserves depletion and global warming. However, renewable energy is also deemed a clean and green choice for power generation to promote sustainability in engineering. The coastal lines of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) are widely extended, and wind energy appears to be a viable alternative to traditional sources, which needs to be investigated as it is highly desirable to seek energy from renewable energy sources, for instance, wind. This paper is aimed at addressing the wind energy potential along the Red Sea coast of KSA. Afterward, a suitable wind turbine based upon careful structural analysis has been proposed, which would form a basis, especially during the machine selection and design phases. For this purpose, seven different sites located along the coastal line, namely: Al Wajh, Umluj, Yanbu, Rabigh, Jeddah, Haddad, and Gizan, were initially selected to assess the wind energy availability. After that, a suitable turbine is recommended for yielding maximum output. It has been found from the reconnaissance that Al Wajh has sufficient land availability that receives high perennial wind speed, alongside shallow offshore water depth for monopile installation. Hence, this site is recommended for the development of a wind farm. Furthermore, turbines need to be installed at the height of almost 100 m to produce maximum energy to appropriately utilize the available indigenous wind energy. It is pertinent to mention that the superstructure of the turbines is designed based on the local loading conditions (wind, currents, waves, etc.) of the Al Wajh region. Also, the monopile substructures are proposed in the selected area in accordance with the available bathymetry. Â© 2021. The Authors. Published by CBIORE.

AB  - Offshore wind energy is an attractive technology for renewable energy. For cold climate regions, such as Canada, Baltic Sea, Bohai Bay, ice load is one of the important dynamic loads for offshore wind turbine (OWT). This paper describes a dynamic ice-structure interaction study of a monopile-type offshore wind turbine which is commonly used in the offshore wind industry. A numerical model for ice-structural interaction was implemented in the aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulation tool HAWC2. Both decoupled and coupled analyses were carried out considering relevant environmental conditions. The sensitivity of the response to the parameters used to describe the ice load on the turbine was examined. The characteristics of the ice load effects on the dynamic responses of the monopile OWT were discussed. Â© 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

TI  - Cylindrical triboelectric nanogenerator based on swing structure for efficient harvesting of ultra-low-frequency water wave energy
AB  - Ocean wave energy is a promising energy source for large-scale exploitation owing to its abundant reserve and renewability. An effort is underway to develop a generator that can adapt to the ultra-low frequency of ocean wave vibration. Here, we designed a cylindrical triboelectric nanogenerator with an internal swing structure for effective water wave energy harvesting. Based on the supporting effect of the bearing component, the rotary dielectric films can be suspended over the stator electrodes, rather than coming into direct contact with them. Benefiting from the largely reduced resistance and continuous swing of an internal rotary component, the fabricated triboelectric nanogenerator can operate for about 85 s and produce over one thousand current pulses after one water wave excitation. Being agitated by a 0.033 Hz water wave (during a period of 30 s), the optimized cylindrical triboelectric nanogenerator can produce a peak power density of 231.6 mW center dot m(-3) and an average one of 39.8 mW center dot m(-3). Successful demonstrations of powering portable electronic devices and iron material corrosion inhibition under such simulated excitation indicate the robust capability for ultra-low-frequency water wave energy conversion. This triboelectric nanogenerator offers a new vision for efficient ultra-low-frequency wave energy harvesting with the possibility of large-scale blue energy.

The leaders are Europe, led by the UK, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden, followed by China and the USA. Europe had installed 10 Gigawatts (GW) capacity by 2010 and estimates 140GW by 2020. Offshore wind generation presents many challenges, both technical and economic. But the single biggest is that the wind is not reliable. The use of water power is not new. Waterwheels, using the gravitational effects of streams, have been around since the 1st Century BC. Barrage power generation dates back to before the 1920s. But the technology that is in place today and which offers promise tomorrow is a far cry technologically.

TI  - Global analysis of floating wind turbines: Code development, model sensitivity and benchmark study
AB  - This paper describes the extension of a well-proven state-of-the-Art simulation tool for global analysis of floating structures to also include offshore wind turbine applications, floating as well as bottom-fixed. All structural components of the wind turbine system are included in the finite element model of the complete system. The aerodynamic formulation is based on the blade element/momentum theory, including empirical tip loss and dynamic stall corrections and upwind tower shadow effects. Various wind field descriptions are included, covering simple steady uniform wind to fluctuating turbulent wind, with or without shear profile. A simple PI-control algorithm is used for regulation of the blade pitch angle, and the electrical torque is determined by a lookup table based on generator speed. The system response is calculated by nonlinear time domain analysis. This approach ensures dynamic equilibrium every time step and gives a proper time domain interaction between the blade dynamics, the mooring dynamics and the tower motions. The developed computer code provides a tool for efficient analysis of motions, support forces and power generation potential, as influenced by waves, wind, and current. Results from the developed code are presented and compared with results obtained from other simulation codes. This study also includes the sensitivity of results with regard to various modelling aspects. The last part of the paper presents a benchmark study against the codes of the Offshore Code Comparison Collaboration project. The floater motions, tower forces, and power generation, are presented and discussed. Copyright Â© 2012 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).

TI  - Gaussian process operational curves for wind turbine condition monitoring
AB  - Due to the presence of an abundant resource, wind energy is one of the most promising renewable energy resources for power generation globally, and there is constant need to reduce operation and maintenance costs to make the wind industry more profitable. Unexpected failures of turbine components make operation and maintenance (OandM) expensive, and because of transport and availability issues, the OandM cost is much higher in offshore wind farms (typically 30% of the levelized cost). To overcome this, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) based predictive condition monitoring can be applied to remotely identify early failures and limit downtime, boost production and decrease the cost of energy (COE). A Gaussian Process is a nonlinear, nonparametric machine learning approach which is widely used in modelling complex nonlinear systems. In this paper, a Gaussian Process algorithm is proposed to estimate operational curves based on key turbine critical variables which can be used as a reference model in order to identify critical wind turbine failures and improve power performance. Three operational curves, namely, the power curve, rotor speed curve and blade pitch angle curve, are constructed using the Gaussian Process approach for continuous monitoring of the performance of a wind turbine. These developed GP operational curves can be useful for recognizing failures that force the turbines to underperformand result in downtime. Historical 10-min SCADA data are used for the model training and validation. Â© 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - A new biomimicry marine current turbine: Study of hydrodynamic performance and wake using software OpenFOAM
AB  - Inspired by Dryobalanops aromatica seed, a new biomimicry marine current turbine is proposed. Hydrodynamic performance and wake properties are two key factors determining whether a new marine current turbine design is practical or not. Thus, a study of hydrodynamic performance and wake of the proposed biomimicry turbine is conducted. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, OpenFOAM is used to generate the required results for the mentioned study. The hydrodynamic performance and wake properties of the proposed biomimicry turbine is compared to two conventional turbines of Bahaj et al. and Pinon et al. respectively. The simulation results showed that the proposed biomimicry marine current turbine gives optimum power output with its power coefficient, Cp â‰ˆ 0.376 at the tip speed ratio (TSR) of 1.5. Under the same boundary conditions, the maximum torque pro- duced by the proposed biomimicry turbine at zero rotational speed is 38.71 Nm which is 1110% greater than the torque generated by the turbine of Bahaj et al. The recovery distance for the wake of the biomimicry turbine is predicted to be 10.6% shorter than that of IFREMER-LOMC turbine. The above-mentioned results confirm the potential application of the proposed biomimicry marine curre- nt turbine in the renewable energy industry.

TI  - Optimization of the rear propeller profile of a counter-rotating type tidal stream power unit based on CFD simulation
AB  - In order to convert the kinetic energy of tidal stream, the authors have invented a novel counter-rotating type tidal-stream power unit, which is composed of the tandem propellers and the double rotational armature type peculiar generator without the traditional stator. The commercial code (GH-Tidal Bladed) and academic in-house code (SERG-Tidal) based on blade element momentum theory have been proven well applied to performance prediction for the traditional wind turbine and tidal turbine. However, for the counter-rotating type tidal turbine, it is very difficult to simulate the mutual effect between the tandem propellers using blade element momentum. This paper sets up a CFD model for the counter-rotating type tidal turbine and optimizes the chord and pitch distribution of the rear propeller. The predicted results are compared between the original turbine and optimized turbine, which show great improvement in power efficient after optimization. Copyright Â© 2015 by ASME.

TI  - Machine Learning and Deterministic Methods for Detection Meteorological Phenomena from Ground Measurements: Application for Low-Level Jet and Sea-Breeze Identification in Northern France
AB  - This study focused on the detection of mesoscale meteorological phenomena, such as the nocturnal low-level jet (NLLJ) and sea breeze (SB), using automatic deterministic detection wavelet technique algorithms (HWTT and SWT) and the machine learning recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithm. The developed algorithms were applied for detection of NLLJ and SB events from ultrasonic anemometer measurements, performed between January 2018 and December 2019 at a nearshore experimental site in the north of France. Both algorithms identified the SB and NLLJ days successfully. The accuracy of SB event detection by the RNN algorithm attained 95\%, and we identified 67 and 78 SB days in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Additionally, a total of 192 and 168 NLLJ days were found in 2018 and 2019, respectively. To demonstrate the capability of the algorithms to detect SB and NLLJ events from near-ground ultrasonic anemometer measurements, analysis of the simultaneous wind lidar measurements available for 86 days were performed. The results show a good agreement between the RNN-based detection method and the lidar observations, detecting 88\% of SB. Deterministic algorithms (HWTT and SWT) detected a similar number of NLLJ events and provided high correlation (0.98) with the wind lidar measurements. The meteorological phenomena studied can significantly affect the energy production of offshore wind farms. It was found that the maximum hourly average peak power production could be to 5 times higher than that of the reference day due to higher wind speed observed during NLLJ events. During SB events, hourly average peak power production could be up to 2.5 times higher. In this respect, the developed algorithms applied for analysis, from near-ground anemometer measurements, may be helpful for monitoring and forecasting the meteorological phenomena capable of disturbing the energy production of offshore wind turbines.

TI  - Rapid Hydropower Potential Assessment for Remote Area by using Global Data
AB  - Indonesia currently is facing an energy crisis due to depletion of oil reserves and rapid growth in conventional energy consumption. The declining fossil energy potential especially oil and gas has encouraged the government to put new renewable energy (NRE) as the main priority to maintain energy security for national supply in the future. NRE in Indonesia is generated from bioenergy power, hydro power, solar power, tidal power, wind power, and potential. However, NRE utilization in Indonesia is only about 11% from the total potential. This study assesses the hydropower production capacity of Ayung River Basin, the biggest Basin in Province of Bali. The assessment is carried out by utilizing global data that can be easily accessed. It was found that there are several potential mini-hydropower locations around the Ayung River Basin, with the biggest potential is around 2 MW. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - AIB offshore wind power. Study of the construction of offshore wind power units of naesudden type.
AB  - At the request of the National Energy Board AIB, Allmaenna Ingenjoersbyraan AB has made a study of the construction of offshore wind power plant. The underlying assumptions are that the wind turbine system shall be of the type delivered by KaMeWa to Naesudden on the island of Gotland and that the load bearing structure shall be of concrete and of gravity base design. The study is concerned with plant consisting of 1,3,10 and 100 power units. They are interconnected by a 20 kV submarine cable and the transmission to land is by 130 kV cable if the number is greater than 10 units. Rough time schedules show that under certain assumptions the production of wind power plant can be completed in 2 1/2 years in the case of 3 units, in 4 years for 10 units and in 11 years for 100 units. The initial capital expenditure is estimated at SEK 81 million for a single unit, falling to about SEK 53 million per unit for 100 units (cost level 1 Jan 1984). (from authors' abstract)

TI  - Linear parametric hydrodynamic models for ocean wave energy converters identified from numerical wave tank experiments
AB  - Mathematical modelling of wave energy devices has many uses, including power production assessment, simulation of device motion and as a basis for model-based control design. Apart from computationally heavy approaches, such as those based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH), the vast majority of models employed in the simulation and analysis of wave energy converters (WECs) are based on boundary-element methods (BEMs). While BEM models have been shown to be useful, they have the inherent limitation that they are linearised around the still water level, with validity only on the immediate vicinity of this equilibrium point. In this paper, we develop a new modelling methodology, which combines the fidelity of CFD models with the computational attractiveness of BEM-type models. This flexible methodology can give representative linear models, or be extended into the nonlinear domain, as desired. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Modification of the api p-y formulation of initial stiffness of sand
AB  - Monopiles are currently the preferred concept of support structures for offshore wind turbines. However, experiences from operating offshore wind farms indicate that the current design guidelines (e.g. American Petroleum Institute (API)) under-predict the soil stiffness for large-diameter monopiles. Due to the structural dynamic of a wind turbine, it is unconservative to both over-predict and under-predict the soil stiffness. Only an exact prediction is conservative. The objective with this paper is to introduce an approximate method for determining the soil stiffness of sand regarding large-diameter monopiles by modifying the initial stiffness of the API p-y formulation. The modification introduces both a stress level and a strain level correction derived on basis of sound theoretical considerations without introducing new empirical parameters. It has been shown by benchmarking with full-scale measurements from Walney offshore wind farm that the modified approach provides a more accurate determination of the total soil stiffness, although it is still under-predicted.

TI  - COMPUTATIONAL PREDICTION OF NEAR AND FAR FIELD NOISE DUE TO PILE DRIVING FOR OFFSHORE WIND FARMS
AB  - One major long-term goal of the German government is to decrease the greenhouse gas emissions by 40 \%. This results in a key role of offshore wind farms regarding the turnaround in energy policy. In most cases, offshore wind turbines are erected by pile driving leading to a significant noise impact. In consequence, limiting values for emitted underwater noise have been prescribed to avoid a negative influence on marine mammals. To fulfill these requirements, different sound damping systems are currently developed or under investigation. Thereby, the numerical prediction of the resulting sound pressure level is an important tool to prevent cost-intensive offshore tests. As a general approach different numerical modeling techniques are used to study the generated pressure wave, taking into account the near and far field propagation separately. To model the area near the pile of the wind turbine, a detailed finite element approach is used. For the far field propagation, numerically highly effective methods are needed to predict the sound pressure level at large distances of several kilometers from the pile. In a combined model, results of the area close to the pile are transferred to a separate model using wavenumber integration to compute the sound pressure in the far field of the pile. Detailed investigations of the far field model and the setup of the combined near field-far field model can be found in corresponding publications of the authors {[}1]-{[}4]. The focus of this contribution is on the transformation of the near field model from the time domain to a formulation in the frequency domain to be able to consider frequency-dependent effects, like, e.g., the damping characteristics of bubble curtains.

TI  - Sizing and operation of energy storage by Power-to-Gas and Underwater Compressed Air systems applied to offshore wind power generation
AB  - Among the possible solutions for large-scale renewable energy storage, Power-to-Gas (P2G) and Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) appear very promising. In this work, P2G and an innovative type of CAES based on underwater storage volumes (UW-CAES) are compared from a techno-economic point of view, when applied in combination with a 48 MWe offshore wind power plant, selecting an appropriate location for both high productivity and favorable seabed depth. An optimization model is employed to study the system design and operation, maximizing the lifetime plant profitability, while considering differential installation and operation costs, market values of the products (i.e., hydrogen and electricity), and technological constraints. In the current economic and technological scenario, the resulting P2G system has a nominal power equivalent to about 10% of the wind park capacity, with a small hydrogen storage buffer. On the other hand, the compressor and the turbine of the UWCAES have a nominal power close to the full wind farm capacity, and large underwater compressed air tanks are required. Both options significantly impact the wind plant management but the most beneficial applications of the two systems are different: the P2G results in a compact and flexible unit, whereas the UW-CAES is able to exploit a higher average conversion efficiency (about 80% round-trip) against a much higher installed power and investment cost. Anyway, considering the current framework, the resulting economics are still inadequate, but their competitiveness can improve compatible with the expected evolution of energy markets in the next future.

TI  - Renewed promise for severn power
AB  - The UK government is searching again, at proposals in constructing a tidal barrage across the Severn Estuary linking south west of England with Wales. This mega project could produce 5% of the UK's electricity needs and would be equivalent to the same level of output as about two conventional 1GW power stations. With the potential capacity of 8640MW and an estimated output of 17TWh/yr, the estuary is described as a visionary project and it would provide ancillary advantages in an area prone to flooding. The Severn barrage needs to be balanced against the impact on the estuary's unique habitat as well as its communities and businesses to help reduce carbon emissions and improve energy security.

TI  - A Two-step Reactive Power Optimization Method of Offshore Wind Farms with Discrete Devices Considered
AB  - Offshore wind farms have experienced rapid growth in China, providing adequate power for coastal load centers. While, the investment of offshore wind farms is much higher than that of land-based wind farms. Meanwhile, the transmission loss inside an offshore wind farm (typical value > 3\%) is much higher than that in a land-based one (typical value < 1\%) for larger installed capacity, wider space distribution and significant capacitive reactance of long submarine cables. Therefore, minimization of transmission loss becomes important to reduce the cost of offshore wind farms. Due to nonlinear relation and uncertainty of wind, minimizing active power loss caused by reactive power transmission remains a challenging task. This paper presents a two-step optimization strategy to reduce transmission loss inside offshore wind farm. Discrete devices such as on load tap changing transformer (OLTC) and static var compensator (SVC) are built in, and the uncertainty of wind speed is considered. Step I controls discrete devices with a scenarios based method, while step II fine tunes the reactive power generation of wind turbines. In the optimization, second-order cone relaxation (SOCR) is applied for better computational performance. In contrast with automatic voltage control (AVC), transmission loss decreases by 30\% without significant increase of voltage fluctuation.

TI  - The data-based adaptive graph learning network for analysis and prediction of offshore wind speed
AB  - Offshore wind power plays an important role in the economy because of its abundant resources and great potential. Therefore, predicting offshore wind power significantly affects the intelligent management of power generation. However, tackling such forecasting task usually meet huge challenges due to the complex-temporal dependence on offshore wind data. Recently, deep learning approaches have successfully demonstrated their ability in modeling time series data. However, they often have significant limitations for failing to explore dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies between signals. In this paper, we propose a new framework DAGLN, which performs spatial dependency modelling through data-driven graph construction and graph learning, breaking through the limitations of predefined graph structures to obtain high-dimensional spatial features and capturing temporal information from them based on GRU structure. The model can play a powerful role in mining spatio-temporal correlations in multi-node and multi-step wind speed data prediction. Extensive experiments on selected nodes and data in the China Sea show the developed approach can outperform state-of-art models in multi-node wind speed prediction. Â© 2023 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Analysis of wake effects on global responses for a floating two-turbine case
AB  - While most existing modeling and analysis of floating wind turbines (FWTs) considers isolated systems, interactions among multiple FWTs arranged in an array have received little attention. In this study, two 10 MW semi-submersible FWTs, separated by 8 rotor diameters (D) in the wind direction, are simulated with an ambient wind speed of 10 m/s and in moderate wave conditions using FAST. Farm to investigate the effects of wakes on global responses. Synthetic inflow is generated using three methods: the Kaimal turbulence model, 1) without and 2) with spatial coherence in the lateral and vertical velocity components, and 3) the Mann turbulence model (where spatial coherence in all three dimensions is inherent to the model). The first method results in negligible wake meandering, a relatively uniform wake deficit, while the second and third methods result in meandering of the upstream turbine's lateral wake center at the downstream turbine's rotor plane of up to approximately 1D and 1.5D, respectively. The slow meandering behavior of the upstream turbine's wake resulted in increased low-frequency platform motions for the downstream turbine. Yaw motions were especially susceptible to wake meandering as the standard deviation of the downstream turbine's yaw motion increased by 28.0 % for the second method and 11.3 % for the third method. Increased low-frequency response in structural loading was also observed. Wake effects led to between 2 % and 30 % greater fatigue damage at the top of the tower for all three methods and at the base of the tower for the second method. However, other results were found to be sensitive to the blade-passing frequency. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Will 10 MW wind turbines bring down the operation and maintenance cost of offshore wind farms?
AB  - Larger wind turbines are believed to be advantageous from an investment and installation perspective, since costs for installation and inner cabling are dependent mainly on the number of wind turbines and not their size. Analogously, scaling up the turbines may also be argued to be advantageous from an operation and maintenance (O\&M) perspective. For a given total power production of the wind farm, larger wind turbines give a smaller number of individual machines that needs to be maintained and could therefore give smaller O\&M costs. However, the O\&M costs are directly dependent on how failure rates, spare part costs, and time needed by technicians to perform each maintenance task and will develop for larger wind turbines. A simulation study is carried out with a discrete-event simulation model for the operational phase of an offshore wind farm, comparing the O\&M costs of a wind farm consisting of 5 MW turbines with a wind farm consisting of 10 MW turbines. Simulation results confirm that O\&M costs decrease when replacing two 5 MW turbines by one 10 MW turbine, if the total production capacity and all other parameters are kept equal. However, whether larger wind turbines can contribute to a reduction of cost of energy from an O\&M perspective is first and foremost dependent on how the failure rates and maintenance durations for such wind turbines will develop compared to 5 MW wind turbines. Based on the results of this analysis, it is concluded that higher failure rates and maintenance durations rapidly are counterbalancing the benefits of larger wind turbines.

TI  - A screening method to quantify the economic viability of off-grid in-stream tidal energy deployment
AB  - This study provides a framework to assess the economic viability of introducing tidal energy in a remote community to be used as a rapid screening tool by communities or project developers. Tidal projects life-cycle costs are modelled using the capabilities of HOMER Pro. Communities are described by the local price of diesel fuel (as a metric of the cost of electricity), their electrical load scale, and the local tidal current resource. A sequence of HOMER Pro models, exploring a range of these parameters and tidal turbine rated power combinations, were performed in pursuit of a simple relationship with economic viability. A general structure emerged which suggested three conditions informing the economic viability of introducing tidal energy in a remote community. These conditions were found to also be useful for determining the economic ``break-in{''} scale for a tidal stream turbine in a given remote community. As validation, a case study involving ten remote communities along the British Columbia coast was carried out using HOMER Pro. For all ten communities, the conditions either (a) predicted correctly that the community is not economically viable, or (b) predicted correctly that the community is economically viable and the minimum turbine scale.

TI  - Experiments on floating wave-power generation using piezoelectric elements and pendulums in the water tank
AB  - In late years, the action for the environmental problem becomes more and more active in the world. The country like Japan, being surrounded by the sea, is rich in ocean energy. It is relatively easy to get wave energy among ocean renewable energies. The wave power generation device to collect wave energy has been studied in many countries of the world including Japan. There are a lot of electrical generating systems which use a turbine. But, the environment in ocean is different from that in land. Because the turbine is weak in ocean breeze, it is more difficult to maintain it. Therefore we proposed a new electrical generating system, which doesn't use a turbine, using the piezoelectric element and pendulums. Â© 2012 IEEE.

TI  - Offshore grid topology optimisation with a geographical information system
AB  - A novel methodology is investigated to identify and optimise large scale offshore grid topologies connecting multiple wind farms and countries with each other. A Geographical Information System (GIS) is setup to cluster wind farms and create a permissive graph topology. Its purpose is to propose grid layouts with potential hub locations and landing points bottom-up in a fully analytical toolchain, while avoiding manual scenario building. A coupled market model performs the investment optimisation into new lines on the GIS created graph. This two-step procedure is demonstrated at the example of the Baltic Sea Region for the target year 2040. It can be found, that future offshore topologies benefit from bundled transmission paths and many clustered wind farms. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the topology results are sensitive for wind farm location assumptions and pre-defined interconnectors or hubs. Not least, the capability of the onshore grid to integrate the influx of offshore wind power and the level of detail it is modelled in, directly reflects on the topology results for the offshore grid. It is concluded that optimising the future offshore grid is a quest of pan-European scale which benefits heavily from geo data based pre-processing in a GIS. Â© 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing.

TI  - Floating offshore windfarm integrated in the subsea field development-saipem windstream concept, applied to a case study
AB  - Oil and Gas Operators are moving active production and injection equipment onto the seabed with the aim of reducing CAPEX and/or topside space requirements. Moreover, they want to minimize new production floating facilities (e.g. through tie-back to existing FPSO/Floaters). Given this scenario, the overall electric power needs may become an issue because of the extra power demand due to the increasing number of electric consumers placed subsea. These electric loads may include the subsea boosting (pumps or compressors) operations, pipeline heating or the typical subsea water, chemical injection and valves actuation (in the case of all electric control systems), just to mention some of potential subsea power consumers, and may exceed the existing FPSO/Floater power production capacity. A potential solution to overcome this issue consists of the deployment of wind generators combined with topside Island power generation. Offshore wind power is indeed more and more considered for shore power supply, but also by the Oil and Gas industry with the objective of reducing the carbon footprint of their facilities. High power marine wind generators are already consolidated technologies for near coast, and today they are evolving in the short-term to floating solutions for the open sea. Saipem has developed its own floating wind turbine solution, called Hexafloat, consisting in a pendular floating foundation made of tubular elements and connected through tendons to a counterweight. This solution is particularly cost-competitive for deepwater locations (thanks to the low mooring costs) even for harsh environmental conditions (thanks to an excellent stability), and will unlock the possibility to deploy large wind power generators far from the coastline in deep water. The system composed by the Hexafloat base and the wind generator may be equipped with onboard backup generation utilities to provide continuous power supply for subsea, despite wind intermittency, and to provide support to certain subsea field development services, making the assembly a kind of supporting device for the subsea field or for the FPSO. This is the Windstream concept that is under internal development and that will be better described in the present paper through the explanation of the results achieved within a couple of case-studies analyzed.

TI  - Limits to tidal current power
AB  - Estimating the extractable power of tidal currents in channels is a practical question that has received attention recently. Analysis has clearly shown that the power potential is not given by the flux of kinetic energy, as has been commonly assumed. A general formula for the maximum available power is reviewed, along with assessments of the reduction if only partial fences are used, as would be required for navigational and ecological reasons. In typical situations, the maximum power obtainable may be achieved with a surprisingly small number of turbines, especially if allowance is made for the flow reduction caused by drag on the supporting structures of turbines which reduces the maximum power available. Finally, the flow through tidal turbines is compared with the cooling water demands of nuclear reactors generating the same power. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Perspectives on offshore wind farms development in chosen countries of European Union
AB  - At the end of 2016 there were 84 wind farms under construction in 11 European countries. Investments in this sector are enormous. The average cost of a wind farm construction amounts to approx. 4 mln EUR per 1 MW of installed power. Offshore wind energy production also plays a significant role in the process of ensuring energy security in Europe, and in reduction of greenhouse gases. The objective of this paper is to present prospects of offshore wind energy farms development in the leading member states of the European Union as regards this problem. In this paper offshore wind farms in Germany and Denmark have been studied. In the paper the power of wind farms, the support systems as well as criteria related to location of wind farm offshore have been analysed. German and Danish sectors of offshore wind energy are strongly supported by respective governments. Both countries aim at yearly increase of wind energy share in total energy production. The research has been conducted based on the analysis of acts, regulations, the subject's literature and information from websites. Â© 2018 Leszek Dawid, published by Sciendo.

TI  - A three-level neutral-point-clamped inverter with flying-capacitor auxiliary legs
AB  - A three-level flying-capacitor (four-leg) neutral-point-clamped (3L-FC-NPC) inverter is proposed for a large offshore wind power conversion system with light high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission. The fourth flying-capacitor (FC) leg is added to eliminate mid-point voltage imbalance of the DC link including DC drift and low-frequency voltage fluctuation. The principle of the added FC leg is discussed first. Then three different voltage closed-loop control methods are proposed and compared. Finally, simulation and experiment show the correctness of modeling and analysis. Â© 2014 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute Press

TI  - Experimental Investigation On Mooring Loads And Motions Of A TLP Floating Wind Turbine
AB  - This paper investigates numerically and experimentally the behaviour of a Tension Leg Platform (TLP) floating wind turbine, under regular waves. The physical model tests have been performed at the Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI) offshore wave basin. The general aim of this work is to form an accurate set of data, basically consisting in incident waves, 3D wave oscillation and mooring loads that may be used as a possible term of reference for numerical models. The paper provides a thorough description of the geometrical and dynamic characteristics of the floating body, and the results in terms of the incident waves interpreted on the basis of an array of resistive wave gauges, the displacements as observed by a tracking camera system (surge, sway, heave and roll, pitch, yaw), and the loads measured by a load cell located at the fairlead of the anchoring lines, simulating in the physical model scale the tendons characteristics in full scale. Experimental results are given in graphical form for the case of regular wave conditions. Corresponding numerical results that have been obtained using home developed software for the hydrodynamic- and the staticand dynamic-analysis of the mooring lines (HAMV AB {[} I] and ST ATMOOR [}2], respectively) compare well with the experimental data. STATMOOR [}2] is capable to handle the static analysis of extensible mooring lines made of several segments each of them with different geometrical properties and with attached submerged buoys along them.

TI  - Design and Experiment of a New Wave Power Conversion Device for Self-Powered Sensor Buoy
AB  - The power supply system design of a marine data buoy system is a challenge. Due to cost reasons, it is difficult for marine buoys to obtain electricity directly from the power grid. At present, marine buoys use solar energy, wind energy or wave energy to supply power to sensors. Among them, the employment of wave energy and solar energy has broad application prospects due to the complementary power production of these sources. This paper presents a new wave energy' conversion (WEC) device for a marine buoy, which is composed of a floating body and a power generation device. In addition, a three-dimensional finite element simulation model of the buoy movement is established, and the simulation is carried out using hydrodynamic software. On the basis of simulation, experiments are carried out on a 50 kg core power generation unit to estimate the power generation performance of the proposed WEC device.

TI  - Hydroelastic analysis of multi-unit floating offshore wind turbine platform (MUFOWT)
AB  - Along with global warming threat, importance of renewable energy development is on the rise for global sustainable development. To amplify productivity of ocean renewable energy, a multi-unit floating offshore wind turbine platform (MUFOWT) is designed by KRISO (Korea Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering). The MUFOWT is a square frame structure with slender bracing structures, and it hosts multiple wind turbines at corners and a series of point absorber-type wave energy converters between the corners. For station keeping, a spread mooring system is employed at each corner. Considering multiple dynamic excitation sources acting on the frame structure such as random waves, mooring tension, wind loads, and wind turbine dynamics, the coupled hydroelastic responses of the MUFOWT are investigated in terms of resonance risk and consequences in motion and structural responses. Using the time-domain hydroelastic analysis tool and time-domain offshore wind turbine dynamics analysis tool developed by the present authors, we investigate global performance of the MUFOWT including the dynamic deformation resulted from the interactions of the floating body dynamics, random sea loads, mooring dynamics and wind turbine dynamics. Moreover, resonance deformation of the MUFOWT and the causes are investigated. Copyright Â© 2017 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).

TI  - Offshore wind energy systems for the U.K.
AB  - The power densities in offshore winds are high, of the order 300 kW per linear metre (perpendicular to the wind direction) or 1500 W per square metre of rotor swept area. The economics of offshore operation favours the use of large wind turbines, about 100 M diameter, and a low rated wind speed. A typical offshore wind energy system might therefore comprise a 10 x 10 array of 100 M diameter wind turbines, to give a cluster rating of 600 MW and a plant factor (average output relative to rated output) of about 40%, Such a cluster would occupy an area 10 km square, surrounded by a wind energy catchment area 25 km square. Shallow waters, less than 20 m deep, provide locations for about 25 such clusters which would contribute 25% of the present electricity needs of the U.K., and the author considers that a preliminary economic assessment is encouraging.

TI  - Controlling strategies for meshed offshore DC collector grids
AB  - The grid integration of future wind farms far away from the shore demands efficient energy transmission systems. Moreover, the growth of generator power leads to the need of transmission lines and grids with huge power transmission capacities. To establish reliable offshore grids with low losses, HVDC systems are proposed as a suitable solution. The direct coupling of wind turbine generator systems (WTGS) to a DC collector grid is considered to avoid offshore AC collector grids with large reactive losses. Meshes in the grid lead to the possibility of linking different offshore transmission lines on the one hand and, on the other hand, a meshed grid is more robust against disturbances within the grid or on single transmission lines. This paper presents centralised and decentralised methods to control a meshed DC collector grid and compares advantages and disadvantages by simulation. Â© VDE VERLAG GMBH Â· Berlin Â· Offenbach.

TI  - Hydrokinetic turbines for power generation in Nigerian river basins
AB  - This work presents a design for Hydrokinetic Renewable Energy (HRE), for off grid power generation for remote riverine regions in developing nations. The uniqueness of this technique for power generation using streams and other marine currents to generate electric energy is detailed. The problem of the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the environment, rapid increase in human population, industries, modernization and our lifestyle put immense pressure on most power generation plants and infrastructures. Thus, global warming and carbon footprints of using fossil fuels to generate energy has driven the interest for energy generation from renewable sources. The Upper River Benue and Lower River Niger coastal basins, as well as the River Niger Basin on the Lower Niger sub-basin area of southeastern Nigeria was selected as a case study for the design of the hydrokinetic power generation technology. The results show that for a hydrokinetic turbine the level of power output is directly proportional to the flow velocity. Therefore the cost of its installation is reduced drastically from about $7,900 per installed kW to about $2,500 per kW, is easily assessable, less technical and a familiar motor technology for most of these communities. It is also a predictable form of energy in comparison to other emerging renewable energy fields like wind, solar and wave. Also this form of renewable energy is less harmful to the environment, has a lower noise emission and produces no greenhouse gases or any solid waste. HRE will bring energy security that is essential for the riverine dweller and curb rural urban migration and both improves the rural communitiesâ€™ standard of living and enhances their productivity.

TI  - Combining wave energy with wind and solar: Short-term forecasting
AB  - While wind and solar have been the leading sources of renewable energy up to now, waves are increasingly being recognized as a viable source of power for coastal regions. This study analyzes integrating wave energy into the grid, in conjunction with wind and solar. The Pacific Northwest in the United States has a favorable mix of all three sources. Load and wind power series are obtained from government databases. Solar power is calculated from 12 sites over five states. Wave energy is calculated using buoy data, simulations of the ECMWF model, and power matrices for three types of wave energy converters. At the short horizons required for planning, the properties of the load and renewable energy are dissimilar. The load exhibits cycles at 24h and seven days, seasonality and long-term trending. Solar power is dominated by the diurnal cycle and by seasonality, but also exhibits nonlinear variability due to cloud cover, atmospheric turbidity and precipitation. Wind power is dominated by large ramp events-irregular transitions between states of high and low power. Wave energy exhibits seasonal cycles and is generally smoother, although there are still some large transitions, particularly during winter months. Forecasting experiments are run over horizons of 1-4h for the load and all three types of renewable energy. Waves are found to be more predictable than wind and solar. The forecast error at 1h for the simulated wave farms is in the range of 5-7 percent, while the forecast errors for solar and wind are 17 and 22 percent. Geographic dispersal increases forecast accuracy. At the 1h horizon, the forecast error for large-scale wave farms is 39-49 percent lower than at individual buoys. Grid integration costs are quantified by calculating balancing reserves. Waves show the lowest reserve costs, less than half wind and solar. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - An Undergraduate Course on Renewable Energy Systems with Enhanced Marine Energy Content
AB  - The world demand for electricity is increasing and conventional energy resources are depleting, making the renewable energy based electricity one of the alternative. Today the renewable energy is one of the most rapidly growing rapidly energy industry. Over the last decades the renewable energy has gone through significant technological advances and extended uses for electricity and other industrial applications. One the other hand, the industry has significantly increased its demands for qualified engineers who can understand and cope with the difficulties inherent in the wide range of disciplines involved in these technologies. Universities are introducing renewable energy courses into their curricula, to empower students to work in this rapidly developing industry. Renewable energy technologies are highly interdisciplinary and are crossing over a number of engineering and science fields making difficult to be covered in a single course. However, renewable energy has a great potential for multi-disciplinary projects, both at undergraduate and graduate levels. Such projects can involve electrical, mechanical, civil, and chemical engineering aspects while still being accessible to undergraduate students. Design and development of renewable energy projects allow students to work on projects that can be relevant to current leading edge research and technologies. The development, content and structure of an alternative energy course as part of this effort to embed renewable energy into our curriculum are also presented. Course motivation is outlined and a detailed description of the topics covered is also given. This course is also part of the efforts of to establish an energy engineering concentration at our university. We would also like to thank in advance any feedback and suggestions provided by educators involved in similar enterprises.

TI  - Seeing the Wind (Farm): Applying Q-methodology to Understand the Public's Reception of the Visuals Around a Wind Farm Development
AB  - This research investigates the reception of the visual representations of a wind farm (WF) development by local stakeholders. Using non-verbal Qmethodology, residents of Lesvos' island, Greece, sort images according to how these images represented their opinion about the proposed Aegean Link WF project. We found three opinion types. The ``Risk Averter{'' type is focused on the various risks of constructing and operating the Aegean Link wind development. The ``Green Developer{''} type believes that the renewable energy project will benefit both their local community and the environment. The ``Realist{''} type defers to expert knowledge to make decisions about project outcomes and is sceptical of media bias. While the former two types seem to form their visual opinions based on whether they are in favour or against (respectively) of the WF development, the Realist opinion is rather guided by carefully considering whether the visual stimuli are representative of the project's actual characteristics.

TI  - Dynamic interaction between resonant wave power systems
AB  - A resonant wave power system consisting of a hydraulic pump, a caisson, a float, a reservoir, pipelines, and turbine and generator has been developed. The potential of the system as a supplement energy resource has been proven by both theoretical studies and experimental tests. The system takes advantage of the resonance of wave motion inside the caisson to amplify float excursion distance and achieve good power generation. This paper presents some new findings by studying an array of wave power systems in ocean. Near- and far-fields of the mathematical model associated with the array of systems are developed and implemented into a finite element computer code previously developed for a single system. Therefore, not only the dynamic interaction among float, caisson and surrounding water but also that between neighboring systems can be included in evaluating the system's performance. The efficiency of the wave power system is investigated by comparing the generated power with the incoming wave power. The system built in conjunction with breakwater are also studied and its effects to the system response are presented.

TI  - The Modular Current-Fed High-Frequency Isolated Matrix Converters for Wind Energy Conversion
AB  - In this article, a modular current-fed high-frequency transformer isolated matrix converters (CF-HFT-MC) based wind energy conversion system (WECS) is proposed. The CF-HFT-MC module utilizes the high-frequency transformer instead of the line-frequency input transformer, and eliminates the bulky and vulnerable electrolytic capacitors in the WECS. Therefore, the power density, reliability and efficiency of WECS can be increased. Moreover, single-stage power conversion and soft-switching can be achieved in the CF-HFT-MC modules, which can reduce the losses of the system. With the function of electric isolation, the wind turbines can be connected in series through the proposed CF-HFT-MC modules. Thus, the total dc output voltage is increased, which enables the offshore wind farm to be integrated to the current-source-converters based HVdc transmission directly. The modulation, control scheme and power sharing method are analyzed and designed for the proposed CF-HFT-MC based WECS in this article. Both the simulations and the experiments are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed system.

Japanese new target for the wind power is expected around 35GW by 2030. Unfortunately, new JDP's government has expressed that it needs 3 to 10 years to decide new energy supply plan. Therefore, this target will not be declared officially in short time. Japan expects offshore wind power highly and many national projects including floating type are proceeding.

TI  - Spending review quells green technology sector anxieties
AB  - Siemens, General Electric and Mitsubishi have indicated that their investment in offshore wind turbine manufacturing in the UK was conditional on a ports upgrade. Osborne's comprehensive spending review (CSR) also indicated that support for the feed-in tariff (FiT) would remain there but savings would be made by refocusing it on the most cost-effective technologies, saving Â£40m in 2014-15. The changes will be implemented at the first scheduled review of tariffs in 2013 unless massive uptake forces the government to carry out an earlier review. Other spending for environmental groups include a Â£1bn investment to create one of the world's first commercial-scale carbon-capture and storage demonstration plants. A total of Â£860m has been planned for the Renewable Heat Incentive, which will be introduced from 2011-12.

TI  - Adaptive fractional-order PID control for VSC-HVDC systems via cooperative beetle antennae search with offshore wind integration
AB  - Since the voltage source converter based high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) systems owns the features of nonlinearity, strong coupling and multivariable, the classical proportional integral (PI) control is hard to obtain content control effect. Hence, a new perturbation observer based fractional-order PID (PoFoPID) control strategy is designed in this paper for (VSC-HVDC) systems with offshore wind integration, which can efficiently boost the robustness and control performance of entire system. Particularly, it employs a fractional-order PID (FoPID) framework for the sake of compensating the perturbation estimate, which dramatically boost the dynamical responds of the closed-loop system, and the cooperative beetle antennae search (CBAS) algorithm is adopted to quickly and efficiently search its best control parameters. Besides, CBAS algorithm is able to efficiently escape a local optimum because of a suitable trade-off between global exploration and local exploitation can be realized. At last, comprehensive case studies are carried out, namely, active and reactive power tracking, 5-cycle line-line-line-ground (LLLG) fault, and offshore wind farm integration. Simulation results validate superiorities and effectiveness of PoFoPID control in comparison of that of PID control and feedback linearization sliding-mode control (FLSMC), respectively.

TI  - Offshore wind energy: A comparative analysis of UK, USA and India
AB  - Offshore wind is one of the most fascinating industries in the renewable energy sector and it is experiencing a remarkable growth. Offshore wind energy generation offers an opportunity in the race to decrease the dependence on fossil fuels, reduce green house emissions, increase energy security and create employment opportunities. UK has proven success in offshore wind and has been enjoying the economic benefits of offshore wind since over a decade. Offshore wind energy is an emergent renewable energy industry in the United States. The United States is coping up with the challenges and heading up fast to catch up with the industry. India is still in its infancy stage where the policy frameworks are framed by MNRE government and getting ready with the tools to enter into the offshore market. This paper researches the current situation and trend of offshore wind industries in UK and US, from aspects of policy, grid connections, operation and maintenance and cost reduction and analyses the proper direction and pathways of the industry to India. Therefore this paper highlights the scenario as to how these three countries UK, USA and India, respectively, are enabling offshore wind, to make a vital and sizeable contribution to the low carbon economy.

TI  - Beneficial wave motion response for wind turbine support TLPs with synthetic rope tendons
AB  - As the offshore wind industry matures and projects begin to expand to deeper water regions, various floating systems are being considered to support wind turbines. This paper explores the feasibility of a Tension Leg Platform (TLP) support system anchored with synthetic rope tendons attached to a gravity base template to provide a platform for a wide range of water depths with acceptable operating nacelle accelerations. In this paper, the NREL 5MW wind turbine is selected in order to provide a comparison to previous studies of steel tendon TLPs. A fully-coupled numerical modeling tool is used to assess the effects of extreme irregular sea loads on the TLP. A series of numerical simulations are carried out to compare the response of a Single Column (SC) TLP for three different water depths and three different environments. The responses are compared with the steel tendon model. The use of synthetic rope tendons potentially offers more efficient installation options and enlarges the range of acceptable water depths. The use of a gravity base/suction pile foundation may improve the installation cost and schedule. The fully coupled nonlinear, time domain analysis tool used provides a unique look into the fully operating wind turbine under stable motion characteristics of the TLP.

TI  - Coordinated optimization of VSC-HVDC controller considering DC line
AB  - VSC-HVDC system, such as in offshore wind farms, will be widely used in the next few years. The controller parameters of both rectifier and inverter will have a great impact on both the system itself and the other parts of the transmission system due to the connection of DC transmission line. Usually, the controller parameters on each side are designed and tested separately. Therefore, the performance of the whole system can hardly achieve the best operation state. In this paper, a new method of coordinated optimization considering DC line is proposed. A united transfer function model is also established. Then, according to ITAE (integral of time multiplied by the absolute value of error) criterion, the parameters of both converters are optimized simultaneously. Simulation results verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed optimization method. Â© 2015 IEEE.

TI  - Humber rides the wave
AB  - A full-scale demonstrator, Neptune Proteus NP1000, from East Yorkshire-based Neptune Renewable Energy, will be completely constructed and commissioned shortly afterwards. The Â£1m demonstrator, the first tidal-stream-energy device for estuaries, will be deployed in the Humber Estuary. Proteus has a lightweight, exoskeletal structure designed to optimize estuarine locations where there are not the problems and stresses associated with wave activity and where strong tidal regimes can be found. The turbine is built with a distinctive square-turbine cross section, which generates 30% more electricity per unit channel width compared to circular turbines. The Proteus is also designed with patented flow-control shutters to maximize the area of water hitting the turbines, thus increasing torque and power output. Neptune Renewable Energy stated that the Humber Estuary was selected for the first deployment of Proteus as, given its depth and tidal flow, it is considered one of the best locations in the British Isles for tidal-stream power.

TI  - Verification within wave resource assessments. Part 2: Systematic trends in the fit of spectral values
AB  - Interest in wave energy as a viable renewable energy has increased greatly in the past couple of decades. To determine the potential that a certain location has to harvest wave energy, a resource assessment must be performed for that location. As wave energy converter technologies get closer to market, it is becoming necessary to undertake more detailed resource assessments to determine the optimal location for deployment as well as the design and operating sea states. This study shows the level of sophistication that must be included in the verification process within a wave resource assessment. We describe the methodology in two articles. Part 1 described a procedure for a complete statistical analysis of the fit of the model. This paper will demonstrate how investigating systematic trends in the fit of spectral values is essential for determining the precise problem areas of the model and is thus required as part of the verification processes. Lacking this detail could mean failing to notice potentially vital issues for energy extraction at the location of interest. The identification of specific problem areas will enable a well-informed consideration of the necessary next steps for improved prediction of energy extraction. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Are wave and tidal energy plants new green technologies?
AB  - Wave and tidal energy plants are upcoming, potentially green technologies. This study aims at quantifying their various potential environmental impacts. Three tidal stream devices, one tidal range plant and one wave energy harnessing device are analyzed over their entire life cycles, using the ReCiPe 2008 methodology at midpoint level. The impacts of the tidal range plant were on average 1.6 times higher than the ones of hydro-power plants (without considering natural land transformation). A similar ratio was found when comparing the results of the three tidal stream devices to offshore wind power plants (without considering water depletion). The wave energy harnessing device had on average 3.5 times higher impacts than offshore wind power. On the contrary, the considered plants have on average 8 (wave energy) to 20 (tidal stream), or even 115 times (tidal range) lower impact than electricity generated from coal power. Further, testing the sensitivity of the results highlighted the advantage of long lifetimes and small material requirements. Overall, this study supports the potential of wave and tidal energy plants as alternative green technologies. However, potential unknown effects, such as the impact of turbulence or noise on marine ecosystems, should be further explored in future research. Â© 2016 American Chemical Society.

TI  - ISWEC Devices on a Wave Farm Handled by a Multi-Agent System
AB  - This paper aims to contribute to the improvement of the energy extracted from Wave Energy Converters, arrayed in a wave farm, through the implementation of several actions, namely wave extrapolation using a dynamic neural network, wave type identification resorting to a machine learning system, and coordination of the interoperability, communication, and control of all the devices belonging to the wave farm via a Multi-Agent System. The Multi-Agent System was initially developed and subsequently tested through simulations. Simulations used the Inertial Sea Wave Energy Converter, which extracts power from sea waves, using gyroscopic motion, to generate electricity. This device can be originally controlled by proportional-derivative controllers with parameters that change with the sea state. With this Multi-Agent System, ocean waves and corresponding sea states are identified using a machine learning wave classifier method. Information is passed on so that all devices can use optimal control parameters. Therefore, energy extraction by the wave farm is enhanced due to the combination of the Multi-Agent System with automatic learning methods, while its architecture is resilient to communication problems between devices. Simulation results for a case study showed an increase in the average power absorbed, proving the effectiveness of combining a Multi-Agent System with automatic learning methods. Conclusions demonstrated that the proposed system architecture is a viable alternative to the original wave forecasting model. Additionally, this Multi-Agent System can be adapted to wave farms with other Wave Energy Converters and other types of control. Â© 2021

TI  - Theoretical and experimental study on the performance of a high-efficiency thermodynamic cycle for ocean thermal energy conversion
AB  - A new high-efficiency ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) system using non-azeotropic mixed working fluids with two regenerative cycles is proposed. Based on the first law of thermodynamics, a numerical calculation model for the proposed cycle was established to study the effects of the mass fraction of mixed working fluids, turbine inlet pressure and seawater temperature on the performance of the cycle system. An experimental plant of the proposed OTEC system was established to study the effects of seawater temperature and turbine inlet pressure on the cycle thermal efficiency. The results show that the cycle thermal efficiency and net output power of the system both increase with a decrease in cold seawater temperature or an increase in warm seawater temperature. The system cycle thermal efficiency and net output power both initially increase and then decrease with an increase of the working fluid mass fraction. The system cycle thermal efficiency and net output power both initially increase and then decrease with an increase of the turbine inlet pressure under a certain working fluid mass fraction. The experimental results of cycle thermal efficiency with various performance parameters were basically consistent with the theoretical analysis results; however, the experimental values were lower than the theoretical analysis results.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Model tests of Sigma wave energy converter: The lessons learned
AB  - For a number of years, Sigma Energy has been developing a novel type of a wave energy converter. It is a point absorber which transforms, by original mechanical PTO system, the wave-induced vertical motion of the circular float due to waves into electrical energy. The performance of the device has been thoroughly analyzed by original software developed by Sigma Energy as well as by several model tests. All this resulted in a good proof of concept and validation of the technology used. The last model tests (supported by the MARINET initiative) were performed with two main objectives: to verify the numerical prediction tools and to check the new electronic system for the generator control. Several other innovations applied on the device were carefully observed and analyzed as well. The tests, in general, showed a very favorable operating behavior of the device. They also clearly presented potentials and limitations of both the numerical and the experimental approach. As one of the important outcomes, they indicated some additional resistance of an idling generator that was not predicted by the numerical modeling. If the additional electrical damping is measured and incorporated into the numerical codes, a very good correlation between the numerical prediction and experimental results was found. But, in spite of the general agreement, some discrepancies were found. Some dilemmas which could not be solved by a numerical prediction were clarified, but some (unexpected) problems did occur as well. In the belief that the lessons learned could have a more general interest, the paper presents the main results of the experiments, their analysis and a comparison to numerical prediction without avoiding some of the remaining dilemmas.

TI  - Modeling the tetraspar floating offshore wind turbine foundation as a flexible structure in orcaflex and openfast
AB  - Floating offshore wind turbine technology has seen an increasing and continuous development in recent years. When designing the floating platforms, both experimental and numerical tools are applied, with the latter often using time-domain solvers based on hydro-load estimation from a Morison approach or a boundary element method. Commercial software packages such as OrcaFlex, or open-source software such as OpenFAST, are often used where the floater is modeled as a rigid six degree-of-freedom body with loads applied at the center of gravity. However, for final structural design, it is necessary to have information on the distribution of loads over the entire body and to know local internal loads in each component. This paper uses the TetraSpar floating offshore wind turbine design as a case study to examine new modeling approaches in OrcaFlex and OpenFAST that provide this information. The study proves the possibility of applying the approach and the extraction of internal loads, while also presenting an initial code-to-code verification between OrcaFlex and OpenFAST. As can be expected, comparing the flexible model to a rigid-body model proves how motion and loads are affected by the flexibility of the structure. OrcaFlex and OpenFAST generally agree, but there are some differences in results due to different modeling approaches. Since no experimental data are available in the study, this paper only forms a baseline for future studies but still proves and describes the possibilities of the approach and codes.

TI  - Advanced wind technology new challenges for a new century
AB  - Wind Energy demonstrated phenomenal growth and improvement in the later three decades of the 20th century. From small niche markets for pumping water and charging batteries, wind became an important supplier of grid tied electricity. These improvements saw modern commercial wind electrical generators grow from simple 50-kilowatt (kW) units to sophisticated multimegawatt (MW) machines capable of generating millions of kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year. The technical advances in wind energy in this time frame were not revolutionary. Scaling to larger size was the primary approach used to improve the cost effectiveness; and improved design methods to properly size turbines for their operating wind environment. Advances in generators, gearboxes, blade designs, blade materials, controls, and computers using improved design codes allowed machines to improve in performance and grow in size until the average modern wind turbine is now more than 1 MW in rating. But as with any maturing technology, most of the easier improvements have already been implemented. Now, at the beginning of the 21st century, wind energy is facing a new set of technical challenges to achieve cost effectiveness in the lower wind speed regimes located closer to large load centers, while avoiding transmission congestion points as much as possible. Success in lower wind regimes and mature turbine design methodologies will require that more technically challenging innovative designs be explored. The application of taller towers to take advantage of higher winds aloft to increase energy capture at the lower wind speed sites is necessitating new research into the turbulent environments at levels of 80 to 150 meter above the ground. At this elevation, the atmospheric boundary layer is much different than near the ground, and new simulation models are needed for this so called mixing layer above Great Plains sites. In addition, new turbine designs of much greater size are being considered for offshore deployment in shallow and even deep waters in both the United States and Europe, where the offshore design environment is quite different than for land-based turbines. Anticipated improvements in technology that will be seen in the next decade in response to these new challenges include: custom designed permanent-magnet (PM) generators; variable-speed power electronic power converters with improved performance characteristics and reliability; unique gearbox designs that are smaller and lighter; improved aerodynamic and structural dynamics codes that accurately predict unsteady loads and aerodynamic stall effects for lighter more flexible turbines under wide ranging atmospheric conditions; improved rotors that utilize aeroelastically tailored blades of advanced materials such as carbon-epoxy composites; higher blade tip speeds with reduced blade chord and lower aeroacoustic emissions; novel new towers employing self erection or advanced composite materials; offshore machines supported on floating platforms; and improved marine electrical collection systems. Any one of these improvements would be considered a major technological advance, but the wind turbine of 2015 will need many, if not all of these innovations to become the low-cost electricity generator of the future.

TI  - Novel Energisation Method for Offshore Wind Farms Connected to HVdc via Diode Rectifiers
AB  - Recently put forward as a feasible alternative for connecting OWFs to HVdc networks, diode rectifiers (DRs) have elicited growing interest from both academia and industry. Energisation of such OWFs is, however, not straightforward. The present study constitutes a proof of concept for the application of a novel energisation method to the case of an OWF connected to HVdc via DRs. The proposed method provides a robust and reliable alternative with minimal additional hardware, i.e. short additional dc cables connecting the dc bus bar of the energising WT to the HVdc link, and corresponding dc disconnectors at the cable terminals and at the DR dc terminals. This can be easily extended to more WTs in the OWF, increasing reliability by providing redundancy. The simulation results indicate that the proposed method is a suitable alternative for energising OWFs connected to HVdc via DRs.

TI  - Potential impacts of blockchain based equity crowdfunding on the economic feasibility of offshore wind energy investments
AB  - This paper explores the potential to reduce the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of offshore wind technology through the use of digitalized financial innovations made possible by Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Specifically, this paper proposed a novel application of DLT to crowdsource project finance for clean energy projects. An introduction to DLT technology and some of its potential applications is provided first. Next, the potential to move from a more centralized, top-down energy system to a more decentralized, two-way transactive energy system enabled by DLT is discussed. Within this new energy system framework, the idea of crowd-sourced equity funding of the capital cost of renewable energy is introduced. The impact of crowdfunded equity on the LCOE is then explored via the creation of a theoretical offshore wind installation off the coast of New Jersey. An existing offshore wind capital cost model is modified for use in the U.S., and an existing wind annual energy production model is utilized to provide inputs into a LCOE model. Finally, the potential impacts that DLT based crowdfunded equity may have on cost of debt, debt tenor, and debt-to-equity ratio are also input into the LCOE model in order to examine the range of potential impacts it may have on offshore wind LCOE.

TI  - Assessing the consistency of in-stream tidal energy development policy in Nova Scotia, Canada
AB  - The provincial government of Nova Scotia, Canada, has provided numerous incentives for developing in-stream tidal energy projects since 2009. These incentives include co-operatively funding the development of the Fundy Ocean Research Centre for Energy with the Canadian federal government and industry partners, extensive funding of environmental impacts monitoring research for tidal energy projects, and offering direct financial incentives for tidal power produced and sold to the grid via feed-in tariffs. However, the provincial government has not treated all scales and types of tidal energy projects equally. Until recently, ambitious targets for hundreds of MW of tidal development by 2020-2025 led to tidal support policies focusing on large, utility-scale projects, with little evidence the tidal energy sector was prepared to pursue such projects in Nova Scotia or elsewhere. Some support was offered to smaller-scale, community-oriented tidal energy projects, but the rules and regulations for such projects were repeatedly changed (and sometimes revoked) between 2012 and 2018. Since the provincial legislature passed the revised Marine Renewable-electricity Act of 2018, a potentially more coherent and consistent tidal energy policy consensus appears to be forming in the province. This paper provides a review of the policies introduced, projects approved and canceled, and sectoral outlook for tidal energy development in Nova Scotia for the period 2009-2018.

The study recommended the construction of a 100 kW solar thermal power plant and the installation of ten medium size wind driven generators with a total rated output of 400 kW. The viability of this 500 kW first alternative energy plant is examined and it is shown that the large initial investment is more than compensated by the diesel fuel savings.

TI  - A Series Injection Strategy for Reactive Power Compensation of Line Commutated HVDC for Offshore Wind Power
AB  - This work relates to the solution of reactive power problem in a line-commutated HVDC link. A series injection strategy has been formulated and the effects have been simulated indicating a significant reduction in reactive power consumption of the link. This would reduce the weight and volume of the capacitance required which is usually employed in such links thereby reducing the overall weight and volume of the converter terminal which has to be supported by a platform in the case of offshore wind power. This reduction would reduce the cost as well as improve the reliability of such a converter terminal.

TI  - Effective renewable energy activities in Bangladesh
AB  - Bangladesh is endowed with plentiful supply of renewable sources of energy. Out of the various renewable sources, solar and biomass and to a limited extend, wind and hydro-power are effectively used. This paper, discusses the effective applications of these resources. Bangladesh receives an average daily solar radiation of 4-6.5 kWh/m2. Solar photovoltaic (PV) are gaining acceptance for providing electricity to households and small business enterprises in grid remote rural areas. Under the 'Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development (RERED) Programme' a total of 64,000 SHSs will be installed by 2007. So far, a total of 37,000 SHSs with a capacity of about 2.5 MWp have been installed in the country. The next effective source of renewable energy is biomass. Under this category improved stoves, bio-gas plant and bio-mass briquitting are note worthy. The Institute of Fuel Research and Development (IFRD) has developed a number of improved stoves. These stoves save 50-70% fuel as compared to the traditional ones. So far, more than 100,000 stoves have been installed in the users kitchens. The potential of biogas technology is immense. According to an official estimates there is a cattle population of 24 million and poultry population of 75 million. This can produce about 3 billion m3 biogas. The Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) and IFRD are working to install the biogas plants in the rural areas. So far, a total of 19,596 biogas plants have been installed. Khulna University of Engineering and Technology (KUET) has successfully under took a research and development work on biomass briquitting technology with a grant from SIDA. By now, this technology has transferred to private entrepreneurs. Currently, about 60 small private enterprises are producing briquettes from rice husk and saw dust. Because the country is flat, hydropower is not abundant. At present, 230 MW is harnessed from the Kaptai dam. Besides, in the southeastern hilly regions a few micro-hydro sites have been identified. Very recently, one 10 kW micro-hydro plant has been installed by LGED at Bamerchara in Chittagong. Wind energy potential is not encouraging except in the coastal areas of Bangladesh. A few wind turbines have been installed as demonstration units. A project is going on for wind mapping of the country by LGED Â© 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ocean wave energy estimation using active satellite imagery as a solution of energy scarce in Indonesia case study: Poteran Island's Water, Madura
AB  - Ocean wave energy is one of the ORE (Ocean Renewable Energies) sources, which potential, in which this energy has several advantages over fossil energy and being one of the most researched energy in developed countries nowadays. One of the efforts for mapping ORE potential is by computing energy potential generated from ocean wave, symbolized by Watt per area unit using various methods of observation. SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) is one of the hyped and most developed Remote Sensing method used to monitor and map the ocean wave energy potential effectively and fast. SAR imagery processing can be accomplished not only in remote sensing data applications, but using Matrices processing application as well such as MATLAB that utilizing Fast Fourier Transform and Band-Pass Filtering methods undergoing Pre-Processing stage. In this research, the processing and energy estimation from ALOSPALSAR satellite imagery acquired on the 5/12/2009 was accomplished using 2 methods (i.e Magnitude and Wavelength). This resulted in 9 potential locations of ocean wave energy between 0-228 W/m2, and 7 potential locations with ranged value between 182-1317 W/m2. After getting through buffering process with value of 2 km (to facilitate the construction of power plant installation), 9 sites of location were estimated to be the most potential location of ocean wave energy generation in the ocean with average depth of 8.058 m and annual wind speed of 6.553 knot.

TI  - New York City backs tidal power
AB  - Located in New York City's East River, the Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy (RITE) project is the first and only grid-connected tidal array project in the world. RITE project developers are seeking approval to install up to 30 additional turbines in the near future. Verdant Power Inc launched the RITE project to commercialize its kinetic hydropower "Free Flow System", which deploys three-bladed turbines in fast-moving tides and rivers to generate energy. Through the RITE Project Phase 2 Demonstration, which lasted from 2006 through 2008, Verdant Power proved that the 4th Generation Free Flow System could function successfully as an efficient source of renewable energy. Using six full-scale turbines, the system delivered 80 Mw-hr of grid-connected energy from the tides of the East River to New York City customers with no power quality problems. A discussion covers how hydrokinetic systems work; project overview; RITE project financial issues; advantages of the East River location; and environmental and security concerns.

TI  - Modelling of linear and non-linear two-body wave energy converters under regular and irregular wave conditions
AB  - This paper studies a two-body wave energy converter oscillating in heave with a floating body of variable geometry connected to a submerged body, which is designed for the specific ocean wave condition with wave excitation frequencies ranging from 0.08 Hz to 0.12 Hz. The study focuses on the parameter and non-linear effects of the converter. Taguchi method has been applied to investigate the system model parameters' influences on the maximum average power output. ANSYS AQWA is employed to obtain the hydrodynamic parameters for calculating the output power. Both linear and non-linear dynamic models of the two-body wave energy converter will be analysed and simulated in both the time and frequency domains. The new scientific contribution is identifying the best parameter combination of the two-body wave energy converter for irregular wave excitations for the Australian ocean wave conditions, evaluating and comparing the output power of both linear and non-linear dynamic models of the two-body wave energy converter. Another contribution is having established a non-linear model for those buoys of non-uniform shape in vertical direction which has largely improved the simulation accuracy in comparison with a linear model where the buoy hydrostatic forces were simulated using a linear approximation model. The most important results are having found that the power-take-off stiffness coefficient and submerged body geometry are the most important parameters to change for the largest output power. It is found that the significant wave height has very little influence on the efficiency whilst the variations of the peak period of the irregular wave can change the efficiency largely. The non-linear hydrostatic force is found to have considerable effects on the buoy's dynamic performance. The best combination of the system parameters for the harvesting performance has been identified using the Taguchi method, which produces a peak efficiency of 51% in irregular waves. This manuscript aims to disclose the parameter effect of a two body WEC on its performance using Taguchi method and to provide a guide for industry and research community for designing a good two body WEC.

TI  - Evaluating a collaborative governance regime in renewable energy: Wind power and the Lake Erie Energy Development Corporation (LEEDCo)
AB  - The Lake Erie Energy Development Corporation (LEEDCo) illustrates the leverage that the collaborative governance regime (CGR) brings to start-up renewable energy ventures. Called Icebreaker, the effort to build the first freshwater offshore wind farm in North America demonstrates that a CGR spearheaded by committed project advocates is critical to pave the way for renewable energy projects. With construction scheduled for 2021, this case study hypothesizes that collaborative leadership is a noteworthy trailblazing method for renewable energy projects. To assess this claim, this case study applies four propositions of the collaborative leadership model (i.e., activating, framing, mobilizing, and synthesizing) and hypothesizes that a committed project steward's capacity for synchronizing the project with existing regulatory constraints is the fifth key element of a successful CGR in the renewable energy context. Perhaps the lessons emerging from this case study will help to guide green entrepreneurs attempting to launch sustainable energy initiatives.

TI  - US takes on offshore wind bottleneck
AB  - The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will improve the economics of US offshore wind projects, but for the country to reach its goal of 30 GW installed capacity by 2030 will depend on streamlining the permitting process. The IRA includes a 30% investment tax credit for offshore wind projects that begin construction before the start of 2026. It also re-introduces a 10-yr production tax credit of up to $15/MW-hr. Funding is increasing for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (Boem), the agency chiefly responsible for leasing and permitting. Boem received a 29% increase in its funding for renewable energy activities for the 2022 fiscal year, to $36.8 million. Boem plans to review at least 16 plans to build and operate commercial offshore wind energy facilities by 2025, representing more than 22 GW of approved and constructed capacity.

TI  - Understanding and Informing Permitting Decisions for Tidal Energy Development Using an Adaptive Management Framework
AB  - Marine hydrokinetic (MHK) energy offers a promising new source of renewable ocean energy. However, the young industry is faced with significant challenges. Most notable is the challenge of regulatory uncertainty that is thought to hamper the successful deployment of new tidal energy technologies. Adaptive management may be one approach to deal with uncertainty and inform permitting decisions for hydrokinetic projects. In this study, we apply the concept of adaptive management to the Cobscook Bay Tidal Energy Project in Maine to better understand and inform permitting decisions. Using a social science approach of observation, interviews, and document analysis, we examine (1) agency roles and authority, (2) agency interactions, (3) regulatory change, and (4) challenges faced in the regulatory and permitting process for MHK development at the federal and state level. We found four institutional factors favorable to an adaptive approach. These include experimentation and learning, institutionalized choice to correct avoidable error, a strong commitment to interagency coordination, and an emphasis on early proactive engagement with project developers. We also identified institutional challenges or vulnerabilities. These include conflicting agency cultures, high financial costs, and long timeframes associated with baseline data collection. Lessons learned from this study can assist regulators, policymakers, and project developers design and implement an actively adaptive management approach that can move new renewable ocean energy development forward in a way that is socially acceptable and environmentally responsible.

TI  - Electromagnetic analysis and experimental study to optimize force characteristics of permanent magnet synchronous generator for wave energy converter using subdomain method
AB  - This paper presents an electromagnetic analysis and experimental verification to optimize the noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) characteristics of a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) for wave energy converters (WECs). WECs applicable to breakwater installed in island areas require a wider operating range and a robust design for maintenance compared with wind-turbine systems. Owing to the use of a permanent magnet with a high energy density, the PMSG has a higher power density than other types of generators; however, strong electromagnetic excitation forces that affect the NVH characteristics are generated. Therefore, in this study, the electromagnetic forces are analyzed through an electromagnetic-field analysis using a subdomain analytical method. Based on the analytical solution, electromagnetic forces were determined. Four electromagnetic excitation forces were classified, and the methods for reducing electromagnetic excitation forces are presented here. Finally, a method for evaluating the system resonance through electromechanical analysis is presented. The proposed analysis, optimization, and experimental study are validated through comparison with finite-element analysis and experimental results. Â© 2021 by the authors.

TI  - A Combined Model Based on the Social Cognitive Optimization Algorithm for Wind Speed Forecasting
AB  - The use of wind power generation can reduce the pollution in the environment and solve the problem of power shortages on offshore islands, grasslands, pastoral areas, mountain areas, and highlands. Wind speed forecasting plays a significant role in wind farms. It can improve economic and social benefits and make an operation schedule for wind turbines on large wind farms. This paper proposes a combined model based on the existing artificial neural network algorithms for wind speed forecasting at different heights. We first use the wavelet threshold method with the original wind speed dataset for noise reduction. After that, the three artificial neural networks, extreme learning machine (ELM), Elman neural network, and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural network, are applied for wind speed forecasting. In addition, the variance reciprocal method and social cognitive optimization (SCO) algorithm are used to optimize the weight coefficients of the combined model. In order to evaluate the forecasting performance of the combined model, we select wind speed data at three heights (20 m, 50 m and 80 m) at the National Wind Technology Center M2 Tower. The experimental results show that the forecasting performance of the combined model is better than the single model, and it has a good forecasting performance for the wind speed at different heights.

TI  - Integrated Dynamics Response Analysis for IEA 10-MW Spar Floating Offshore Wind Turbine
AB  - Wind energy in the deep-sea area is more abundant and the capacity of wind turbines can be made larger. Therefore, the research on deep-sea floating offshore wind turbines will be the primary strategy for wind energy exploitation in the future. The spar-type platform depends on the characteristics of a small water plane, deep draft, and good stability, which has been applied to the commercial development of deep-sea wind energy. In the next ten years, the 10-MW wind turbine will become the mainstream class installed in the floating offshore wind turbine farm. Thus, it is very necessary to conduct a comprehensive and in-depth study on the 10-MW spar type floating offshore wind turbine. The direct-drive 10-MW offshore wind turbine was proposed by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in Wind Task 37 in 2019. In this paper, a spar-type platform is designed to support the IEA 10-MW reference wind turbines, and a nonlinear aero-hydro-servo-elastic numerical model is established using the FAST tool (which is developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, NREL). Then, the accuracy of the wind turbine and the sensitivity of the controller are verified, and the natural periods of the floating offshore wind turbine are obtained by free-decay tests. The natural periods of the platform in six degrees-of-freedom are found to be within the range recommended by the design standard. The measured wind and wave data of the target site close to Fujian Province of China are used to evaluate the performance of the floating offshore wind turbine under the 100-, 50-, 5-, and 2-year-return stochastic weather conditions. The results indicate that the design of the spar platform is reasonable and has excellent hydrodynamic performance.

TI  - Using lidar on wind turbines for yaw error correction: A financial prospective
AB  - Wind energy and especially offshore wind energy faces anuphill battle in the United States to become a mainstream sourceof energy generation due to its high price relative to fossil fuels.The wind industry is looking for methods to reduce the costs ofenergy production by improving the efficiency of wind turbinesand reducing their operation and maintenance costs. Correctionof yaw error is one way to lower the price of wind energy. Yawerror is the angle between the turbine's central axis in horizontalplane and the wind flow direction. LIDAR devices are used tocorrect yaw error, however they are expensive. Therefore, thereis a need to develop a return on investment model (ROI) tocalculate the cost trade-offs of using such systems. This workreviews how yaw error affects the performance andmaintenance costs of wind turbines, discuss the development ofan ROI model and provide a case study with two scenarioswhere LIDAR is used to correct the yaw error of an onshore andan offshore wind farm.

TI  - Aerodynamic design and performance parameters of a lift-type vertical axis wind turbine: A comprehensive review
AB  - The high emission of fossil fuels are major driving forces in renewable energy technology development. In response, the lift-type vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) is experiencing a renewed interest for large-scale offshore wind energy generation and also for small-scale urban devices. Significant research has been published on the aerodynamic design and optimisation of VAWTs. In this paper, an attempt is made to review the aerodynamic design parameters which influence the VAWT's aerodynamic efficiency. Each parameter is discussed in detail regarding their advantages and disadvantages. A baseline VAWT design has been put forward from this literature review to support VAWT aerodynamic analysis. Furthermore, areas of future research requiring attention have been identified to further progress the aerodynamic design and development of VAWTs. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Local and mesoscale impacts of wind farms as parameterized in a mesoscale NWP model
AB  - A new wind farm parameterization has been developed for the mesoscale numerical weather prediction model, the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF). The effects of wind turbines are represented by imposing a momentumsink on the mean flow; transferring kinetic energy into electricity and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). The parameterization improves upon previous models, basing the atmospheric drag of turbines on the thrust coefficient of a modern commercial turbine. In addition, the source of TKE varies with wind speed, reflecting the amount of energy extracted from the atmosphere by the turbines that does not produce electrical energy. Analyses of idealized simulations of a large offshore wind farm are presented to highlight the perturbation induced by the wind farm and its interaction with the atmospheric boundary layer (BL). A wind speed deficit extended throughout the depth of the neutral boundary layer, above and downstream from the farm, with a long wake of 60-km e-folding distance. Within the farm the wind speed deficit reached a maximumreduction of 16%. A maximum increase of TKE, by nearly a factor of 7, was located within the farm. The increase in TKE extended to the top of the BL above the farm due to vertical transport and wind shear, significantly enhancing turbulent momentum fluxes. The TKE increased by a factor of 2 near the surface within the farm. Near-surface winds accelerated by up to 11%. These results are consistent with the few results available from observations and large-eddy simulations, indicating this parameterization provides a reasonable means of exploring potential downwind impacts of large wind farms.

TI  - An opportunistic maintenance policy for offshore wind farms
AB  - An opportunistic maintenance policy for offshore wind farms is introduced, considering imperfect maintenance and the weather window effect. Each wind turbine is regarded as a multi-component system divided into several assemblies. When one unit fails or reaches its critical degradation state, there is an opportunity to implement preventive maintenance for the others, reducing the losses of accidental failures. On the basis of the rolling horizon approach, the system condition is updated after the completion of a maintenance activity. By selecting the optimized maintenance combination at every opportunity, the maintenance plan over the mission period is finalized. The uncertainty of maintenance effectiveness and the costs of the time waiting for a weather window are also considered. Failure information is collected from existing literature to accomplish the calculations. Calculated results indicate that the proposed approach is beneficial to save the maintenance expenditure of offshore wind farms.

TI  - A coupled tide-wave model for the NW European shelf seas
AB  - Understanding the interaction of tides and waves is essential in many studies, including marine renewable energy, sediment transport, long-term seabed morphodynamics, storm surges and the impacts of climate change. In the present research, a COAWST model of the NW European shelf seas has been developed and applied to a number of physical processes. Although many aspects of wave-current interaction can be investigated by this model, our focus is on the interaction of barotropic tides and waves at shelf scale. While the COWAST model was about five times more computationally expensive than running decoupled ROMS (ocean model) and SWAN (wave model), it provided an integrated modelling system which could incorporate many wave-tide interaction processes, and produce the tide and wave parameters in a unified file system with a convenient post-processing capacity. Some applications of the model such as the effect of tides on quantifying the wave energy resource, which exceeded 10\% in parts of the region, and the effect of waves on the calculation of the bottom stress, which was dominant in parts of the North Sea and Scotland, during an energetic wave period are presented, and some challenges are discussed. It was also shown that the model performance in the prediction of the wave parameters can improve by 25\% in some places where the wave-tide interaction is significant.

TI  - The revised FLORIDyn model: implementation of heterogeneous flow and the Gaussian wake
AB  - In this paper, a new version of the FLOw Redirection and Induction Dynamics (FLORIDyn) model is presented. The new model uses the three-dimensional parametric Gaussian FLORIS model and can provide dynamic wind farm simulations at a low computational cost under heterogeneous and changing wind conditions. Both FLORIS and FLORIDyn are parametric models which can be used to simulate wind farms, evaluate controller performance and can serve as a control-oriented model. One central element in which they differ is in their representation of flow dynamics: FLORIS neglects these and provides a computationally very cheap approximation of the mean wind farm flow. FLORIDyn defines a framework which utilizes this low computational cost of FLORIS to simulate basic wake dynamics. This is achieved by creating so-called observation points (OPs) at each time step at the rotor plane which inherit the turbine state. In this work, we develop the initial FLORIDyn framework further considering multiple aspects. The underlying FLORIS wake model is replaced by a Gaussian wake model. The distribution and characteristics of the OPs are adapted to account for the new parametric model but also to take complex flow conditions into account. To achieve this, a mathematical approach is developed to combine the parametric model and the changing, heterogeneous world conditions and link them with each OP. We also present a computationally lightweight wind field model to allow for a simulation environment in which heterogeneous flow conditions are possible. FLORIDyn is compared to Simulator for Offshore Wind Farm Applications (SOWFA) simulations in three- and nine-turbine cases under static and changing environmental conditions. The results show a good agreement with the timing of the impact of upstream state changes on downstream turbines. They also show a good agreement in terms of how wakes are displaced by wind direction changes and when the resulting velocity deficit is experienced by downstream turbines. A good fit of the mean generated power is ensured by the underlying FLORIS model. In the three-turbine case, FLORIDyn simulates 4 s simulation time in 24.49 ms computational time. The resulting new FLORIDyn model proves to be a computationally attractive and capable tool for model-based dynamic wind farm control. Copyright Â© 2022 Marcus Becker et al.

TI  - Design and Implementation of the Pitch Control System for Horizontal Axis Tidal Turbines
AB  - As a new kind of green renewableergy, tidal energy has been received more and more attention. Pitch control is an important function for tidal turbines. So variable pitch control system was designed in this paper in order to adapt to the bi-directional tidal current and protect the turbines. The system adopted 32 bit processor STM32F207 with incremental PI control algorithm as main controller, and realized precise control of the pitch angle. Besides, the system realized the function of feathering control by one click control remotely, which has greatly ensured the reliability of the pitch control. The field test result of the design has provided chances to realize the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under the rated current speed and system operation control. And it has provided valuable data and experience for better development and utilization of the tidal energy.

TI  - Prototyping of a tethered undersea kite to harvest energy from low velocity currents
AB  - The global energy consumption has been on the rise since the last industrial revolution and continues to be. So far the demand could be satisfied by a mixture of conventional and renewable energies. With the global effort to eliminate conventional energies to stop the anthropological climate change, the demand for reliable and predictable renewable energies is growing. Under these circumstances, more attention is drawn towards the development of non-intermittent ocean energy systems. Apart from waves, thermal and salinity gradients, currents are an abundant and reliable ocean energy source. Inspired by state-of-the-art technology, a unique system for current energy, the Current Kite, is presented in the following paper. This tethered undersea kite (TUSK) consist of a wing to which a turbine is attached. The wing drags the turbine through the water in a certain trajectory, sweeping a large area at a relative speed that is several times the actual speed of the underwater current. In the following paper we present the general setup and design of our first and second prototype. The first prototype was build as a prove of concept. It was equipped with active steering and several on board sensors. With the second prototype the aim was to build a more sophisticated system, which would make the active steering redundant and use more efficient, circular flight paths. A wing which would adjust itself in the current and follow the predefined circular path, was designed using numerical simulations. To achieve this circular flight movement without twisting the electrical cable, a swivel and a stress reducer were designed and built to connect the TUSK as well as transfer electrical power to land. In addition the tracking-system was redesigned, communicating by modulation over the power line. This provides a fully autonomous ocean current power plant, which communicates in real time data and has a promising outlook in efficiency, regarding to the state of art. Due to Covid-19 regulations it was not possible to test the prototype. Therefore the paper mainly focuses on the design and construction process, up to the production of the TUSK.

TI  - Hydrodynamic loading on offshore wind turbines
AB  - In the shallow seas that are the favoured locations for offshore wind farms, the limited water depths can result in highly non-linear waves. The determination of the design wave loads involves the selection of appropriate models of wave kinematics as well as force and structural dynamics models. Each selection will involve a compromise between accuracy and usability (speed, ease of use and comprehension of the results). Currently, the offshore oil and gas industry is focusing on ever deeper waters as much of the available hydrocarbon resource in accessible medium depth waters is already being exploited. In contrast, offshore wind energy is being developed in shallower waters, though often at sites exposed to extreme weather such as the European North Sea. The approach needed here will be subtly different but equally demanding, with economic reasons being more prominent. Electricity is a low-value commodity in a highly competitive market and the costs of generation using offshore wind farms are approaching the costs of conventional generation. It is vitally important that inappropriate and excessively conservative design approaches do not sabotage this trend. Although existing offshore design methods can undoubtedly result in a durable structure. there may be excessive cost penalties. On the other hand, non-linear and breaking waves experienced in shallow waters may mean that the design methods based on experience in deeper water are unconservative. The coastal engineering branch does have substantial experience in designing in shallow water conditions, albeit again to much more stringent durability criteria than are appropriate here. This paper gives a final report on the work undertaken on this subject within the OWTES Design Methods for Offshore Wind Turbines at Exposed Sites' research project and examines the following aspects: different recommendations for slender (monopiles) structures, the affect of the shallow water on wave climate, investigation of the uncertainties due to the selection of appropriate models and the associated parameters regarding: (i) wave kinematics models, (ii) wave load models, (iii) and structural models. For the evaluation of proposed engineering models for slender structures, the paper draws prominently on data collected at the Blyth offshore windfarm, where one turbine is comprehensively instrumented and an extensive collection of measurements, including extreme waves, have been recorded. Further details are available in the reports, Camp, T.R. (2003), which describes the whole project, and Henderson, A.R. (2003), which focuses on hydrodynamic loads, written as part of this research project.

TI  - OWC-Type Wave Chamber Optimization Under Series of Regular Waves
AB  - Oceans cover more than 70\% of the Earth's surface, and water waves are considered as unlimited sources of renewable energy. The use of fossil fuels may cause undesired challenges such as global warming and climate change in the nature. Advantages of renewable energy include low operational cost, environment friendliness, simple maintenance procedures, and non-polluting nature. In this study, an oscillating water column (OWC) system close to the onshore was investigated in water level for wave parameters which consist of different wave heights and wave periods. Efficient energy transformation is achieved by using air turbines. In this study, 20 experimental sets were carried out by a piston-type wave maker. The experimental results showed that the chamber geometry of the OWC, water depth, and wave parameters are most important factors in terms of achieving maximum wave power for energy harvesting.

TI  - The investigation of a coaxial twin-counter-rotating turbine with variable-pitch adaptive blades
AB  - Tidal current turbine need to utilize the tidal kinetic energy of the two flow directions of high tide and low tide. Most of the previous power flow energy units used electric motors or hydraulic systems to pitch. This thesis proposes a new design in which the turbine employs swept-back flat blades with a NACA0012 airfoil cross-section, allowing the blades to easily change pitch and adapt to changes in flow direction through the use of hydrodynamic forces. The installation angle of the blades can be adjusted within 15Â°, and the pitch angle varies according to the flow velocity, with a range of plus or minus 15Â°. Magnetic coupling is also used to transmit torque in the prototype, rather than the traditional shaft seal or dynamic seal and the static seal greatly improves the equipment's reliability. The article also thoroughly investigates the effects of a self-pitching double turbine's front and rear turbines, as well as the performance comparison with a single turbine. Theory, simulation, and experiment are used to validate the design's innovation and feasibility. Â© 2022

TI  - Human dimensions of tidal energy: A review of theories and frameworks
AB  - This paper provides a comprehensive review of theories and frameworks for understanding and managing human dimensions of tidal energy. The methods for this review were: 1) the construction of an annotated bibliography of the human dimensions of marine renewable energy literature, 2) an analytical review of the core theories and frameworks found in the literature as applied to tidal energy development in the United States, and 3) an iterative process of conceptual refinement through peer review. Only 48.9\% of the articles in the literature review included a theoretical underpinning, or discussed an existing framework. Of these, 42.2\% were theories or frameworks that were only featured in a single paper, highlighting the need for theoretical focus within this field of study. For those theories and frameworks that had been explored in multiple articles, these theories and frameworks were grouped into nine overarching concepts: acceptance, place attachment, justice, economics, technology innovation systems, environmental assessment, strategic environmental assessment, adaptive management, and marine spatial planning (MSP). Each of these concepts were expounded on to discuss the limitations of the current research on the concept and identify promising avenues for future research. In comparing the functionality of these concepts, most have a realized capacity for understanding costs and benefits, risk and uncertainty. However less than half have a realized capacity for managing costs and benefits and risk, while less than a third have a realized capacity for managing uncertainty. This paper offers a summary table of existing theories and frameworks that could be used as a launching point for detailing a research agenda for more systematically exploring theories and frameworks for human dimensions of tidal energy.

TI  - Energetic Potential Assessment of Wind-Driven Waves on the South-Southeastern Brazilian Shelf
AB  - Global electric energy demand is constantly growing, consequently leading towards the usage of renewable energy sources reducing pollution and increasing sustainability. The ocean is a poorly explored renewable energy source; thus, to evaluate the Brazilian wave energy budget, this study investigated the mean behaviour of the wave power rate on the south-southeastern Brazilian Shelf as well as analysed the temporal variability of the wave power rate at the most energetic locations near the coast. Three locations were examined, namely Laguna, Ilhabela and Farol Island, based on the criteria of high means and small standard deviations. The mean wave power rate was approximately 9.08 kW/m on Laguna, 10.01 kW/m on Ilhabela and 15.93 kW/m on Farol Island. The standard deviation identified in the three locations reached values of 6.47 kW/m on Laguna, 7.59 kW/m on Ilhabela and 13.51 kW/m on Farol Island. Temporal variability analysis was conducted through wavelet analysis. The results show a dominant yearly cycle with a background presence of synoptic cycles, with little deviation between the locations. The El Nino southern oscillation plays a minor role on the energy spectrum of Laguna and does not have a significant influence on Ilhabela and Farol Island.

TI  - Input of fully 3D FE soil-structure modelling to the operational analysis of jack-up structures
AB  - Jack-ups are mobile structures widely employed in the offshore industry as drilling rigs or installation/maintenance vessels (e.g. for offshore wind farms). To assure safety at each location, site-specific assessment is required to predict the performance of the unit during installation and operations. The response of jack-ups to environmental loads is highly affected by the interaction between all footings (spudcans) and the underlying soil, an interaction still challenging to describe under general 3D loading. This work emphasises the potential of 3D continuum simulations to capture non-linear soil-structural interaction in jack-up units. An integrated jack-upâ€“spudcans-soil 3D finite element (FE) model is set up by including strain-hardening soil plasticity and geometrical non-linearity (Pâˆ’Î” effects). After preliminary calibration of soil parameters, the FE model is successfully validated against literature results, namely obtained through (i) small-scale centrifuge experiments and (ii) numerical simulations based on macroelement foundation modelling. The validated FE model is then used to inspect several implications of soil modelling assumptions, as well as the response of the jack-up to relevant 3D loading combinations. The results presented support 3D continuum modelling as a suitable approach to analyse spudcan fixity and, overall, the operational performance of jack-ups. Despite higher conceptual/computational difficulties, fully 3D simulations can valuably complement the insight from (rare) integrated physical modelling, and contribute to the improvement of soil-spudcan macroelement models.

TI  - Assessing the state of knowledge of utility-scale wind energy development and operation on non-volant terrestrial and marine wildlife
AB  - A great deal has been published in the scientific literature regarding the effects of wind energy development and operation on volant (flying) wildlife including birds and bats, although knowledge of how to mitigate negative impacts is still imperfect. We reviewed the peer-reviewed scientific literature for information on the known and potential effects of utility-scale wind energy development and operation (USWEDO) on terrestrial and marine non-volant wildlife and found that very little has been published on the topic. Following a similar review for solar energy we identified known and potential effects due to construction and eventual decommissioning of wind energy facilities. Many of the effects are similar and include direct mortality, environmental impacts of destruction and modification of habitat including impacts of roads, and offsite impacts related to construction material acquisition, processing and transportation. Known and potential effects due to operation and maintenance of facilities include habitat fragmentation and barriers to gene flow, as well as effects due to noise, vibration and shadow flicker, electromagnetic field generation, macro- and micro-climate change, predator attraction, and increased fire risk. The scarcity of before-after-control-impact studies hinders the ability to rigorously quantify the effects of USWEDO on non-volant wildlife. We conclude that more empirical data are currently needed to fully assess the impact of USWEDO on non-volant wildlife. Â© 2012.

TI  - Future projections of offshore wind energy resources in China using CMIP6 simulations and a deep learning-based downscaling method
AB  - Good knowledge of future wind energy resources is crucial for sitting and planning studies of wind farms. The simulation results from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and a proposed new downscaling method based on the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) are both used in this paper to study future offshore wind energy resources in China. The proposed new down scaling method is validated and compared to two traditional methods. It is found that the spatial patterns of downscaled wind speed are highly consistent with the reference data, and biases are significantly reduced by the new method, especially in coastal and shallow water areas. Using the new method, we downscale the CMIP6 future projected simulation results and generate a new dataset of offshore wind speeds in China for the period of 2021-2100 with a resolution of 0.25 degrees. Multi-model ensemble (MME) results project small decreases in the offshore wind speed and wind power density over the East China Sea and increases in those parameters over the South China Sea, for the middle and end of the 21st Century (2041-2060 and 2081-2100) under two representative scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5).

TI  - MODAL ANALYSIS OF COMPOSITE NOZZLE FOR AN OPTIMAL DESIGN OF A TIDAL CURRENT TURBINE
AB  - Monitoring of structural vibrations and operational modal analysis are clearly essential to effectively control structural safety and the operational behavior of tidal current turbines. In order to satisfy industrial requirements, generally related to a mass gain problem, hybridization provides an excellent method to improve the breaking strength of composite materials, while keeping adequate mechanical performance for marine renewable energy applications. In this context, this work aims to study the structural modal analysis of a tidal turbine nozzle and the effect of hybrid materials (carbon/Glass) on the natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes of the three laminates. The modal analysis was calculated by the Finite Element Method using ABAQUS software. According to the results, the stacking sequence has a considerable impact on the natural frequency of the nozzle. Furthermore, it is also found that the resonance effect does not appear for the three laminates under investigation.

TI  - Potential Hydrodynamic Impacts and Performances of Commercial-Scale Turbine Arrays in the Strait of Larantuka, Indonesia
AB  - The Strait of Larantuka, with highly energetic tidal stream currents reaching speeds of up to 3-4 m/s, is a promising site for renewable electricity production from the ocean. This paper presents the results of an assessment regarding the potential hydrodynamic impacts, wake characteristics, and the performances of large scale turbine arrays in the strait. A high-resolution, three-dimensional baroclinic model is developed using the FLOW module of the Delft3D modeling system to simulate tidal currents. The energy of currents is assumed to be extracted by horizontal-axis tidal turbines, which can harness strong bi-directional flow, positioned on sequential rows and alternating downstream arrangements. Enhanced momentum sinks are used to represent the influence of energy extraction by the tidal turbines. Four different array layouts with rated capacities of up to 35 MW are considered. We find that, in the Strait of Larantuka, array layout significantly affects the flow conditions and the power output, mainly due to the geometric blockage effect of the bounded channel. With respect to undisturbed flow conditions in the strait, decreases in current speeds of up to about 0.6 m/s, alongside increases in the order of 80\% near-shore are observed. While operating efficiency rates of turbines reaching around 50\%-60\% resulted during the spring tide in the arrays with smaller rated capacities, the power output of the devices was negligible during the neap tide.

The author has a comparison and analysis of energy conversion,maximum collision force,relationship of horizontal displacement and depth of soil,contact force,shear force and stress-strain. The results show that energy conversion of the pie column under the p-y curve is faster than that under the fixed bottom end restraint; the bottom end of the steel pipe column is more susceptible to be damaged when a ship impacts offshore wind turbine foundation under the fixed bottom end restraint method; the soil layer is from shallow to deep, in which shallow soil has the most influence on the stability of the pile and the horizontal displacement of three steel column gradually decreases, the improvement of the properties of the shallow soil can effectively improve the safety of the pile; the increase of the ship quality, the contact force and shear force are increasing; the difference in contact force between the curve method and the fixed bottom end constraint increases with the increase of the quality of the ship, and the shear force difference decreases.

TI  - Limits of the turbine efficiency for free fluid flow
AB  - An accurate estimate of the theoretical power limit of turbines in free fluid flows is important because of growing interest in the development of wind power and zero-head water power resources. The latter includes the huge kinetic energy of ocean currents, tidal streams, and rivers without dams. Knowledge of turbine efficiency limits helps to optimize design of hydro and wind power farms. An explicitly solvable new mathematical model for estimating the maximum efficiency of turbines in a free (nonducted) fluid is presented. This result can be used for hydropower turbines where construction of dams is impossible (in oceans) or undesirable (in rivers), as well as for wind power farms. The model deals with a finite two-dimensional, partially penetrable plate in an incompressible fluid. It is nearly ideal for two-dimensional propellers and less suitable for three-dimensional cross-flow Darrieus and helical turbines. The most interesting finding of our analysis is that the maximum efficiency of the plane propeller is about 30 percent for free fluids. This is in a sharp contrast to the 60 percent given by the Betz limit, commonly used now for decades. It is shown that the Betz overestimate results from neglecting the curvature of the fluid streams. We also show that the three-dimensional helical turbine is more efficient than the two-dimensional propeller at least in water applications. Moreover well-documented tests have shown that the helical turbine has an efficiency of 35 percent, making it preferable for use in free water currents.

In this study, a hierarchy of factors influencing the future of estuarine tidal energy resources is proposed based on their relevance to SLR. These include primary factors (e.g., tidal prism, tidal range, tidal current, tidal asymmetry), secondary factors (e.g., sediment transport), and tertiary factors (e.g., shifts in estuarine shape/landform). The existing uncertainty regarding SLR impacts on tidal energy resource is high, given the spatial variability of estuaries. SLR may cause tidal ranges or currents to strengthen or weaken, depending on estuarine shape and boundary conditions (e.g., presence or absence of levees and adjacent low-lying areas). To date, local site studies have not resulted in an overarching assessment of SLR effects on tidal energy resources and comparative studies encompassing different regions and estuary types are recommended in order to address the existing knowledge gaps and provide insights for policymakers and stakeholders. SLR implications to estuarine tidal energy resources may be particularly important as SLR-induced changes can alter the available resource within a renewable energy development's operational lifetime (-20-30 years for tidal stream devices and-120 years for tidal barrages). In this regard, broader environmental impacts, as well as technoeconomic assessments, are difficult to predict and long-term management decisions associated with harnessing the potential of tidal energy schemes within estuaries should be made with caution.

TI  - Seawave Power Farm Design: A Case Study
AB  - Current energy crisis and general concerns on environmental issues have triggered an ever increasing effort on harvesting renewable energies. Amongst renewable energy sources, sea wave energy is definitely the one that has been less utilised. This is probably caused by two reasons: i) the strong technical novelties that are required to extract the energy that is contained in a highly and stochastically variable motion; ii) the difficulty o find a suitable electrical system able to convert the energy contained in the motion of the sea into electrical energy. In this paper we propose an approach to set up a general methodology toward the design of a seawave farm. The first step is explained how to choose the conversion system, in the second step is discussed the connection scheme among the converters, in the third step is reported a case study of a whole seawave farm.

TI  - Study on output characteristic of tidal current energy generation devices
AB  - Taking tidal current energy as an example, output characteristic indexes of tidal current energy generation devices were proposed, and normalized pretreatment was made based on qualified rate. According to generalized set pair analysis, a comprehensive evaluation model of tidal current energy generation output was proposed, and improved maximizing deviation method was used to determine weights of all indexes in this model. This method includes three steps: first, entropy method is used to get the attribute weight of indexes. Then lagrangian function is used to solve the variable weight of indexes. At last, normalization processing is used on variable weight of indexes to get weight vector of the index in this comprehensive evaluation model. As a final note, this evaluation model is verified by an example. Â© 2016, Editorial Board of Acta Energiae Solaris Sinica. All right reserved.

TI  - Combined power quality and condition monitoring of offshore networks
AB  - The authors present a paper detailing their experiences (over the past 5 years) in the insulation condition monitoring of land-sea export cables and subsea array and platform interconnection cables in the UK offshore renewables and oil & gas industries. The paper focusses on the use of partial discharge (PD) testing to detect and locate pre-fault PD activity and also the use of time domain reflectometery (TDR) techniques to provide a 'fingerprint' of the cables and to help pinpoint cable faults after they have occurred. The paper will also discuss a 'holistic' monitoring approach, combining a number of condition monitoring technologies, to achieve necessary information to support improved CBM. For the HV networks, power quality monitoring should be integrated with the monitoring of partial discharge (PD), cable sheath current and weather data (i.e. wind, wave or tidal energy resources, power flows and occurrence of overvoltage/overcurrent conditions), with the further cross-correlation of all of these condition and state parameters, in order to allow for the early detection, faster identification and efficient resolving of faults, failures and other problems during the operation. The purpose of such an integrated monitoring platform is therefore, to provide an advanced 'early warning' against insulation faults to enable planning of preventive or corrective maintenance to be carried out and to avert unplanned outage.

TI  - Assessment of wave energy and tidal current energy resources at the sea north of Chudao Island
AB  - The National Marine Energy Test Site of China is located in the Yellow Sea, north of Chudao Island and about 2 km away from Shandong Province. It is mainly aimed at the deployment and testing of small-scale prototypes of wave energy and tidal current energy converters. In this study, wave energy and tidal current energy resources around the test field were evaluated using ocean models. A spectral wind-wave model and a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model were used to simulate the wave energy and tidal current energy, respectively. The simulation results were validated using the observations, and showed good agreement with the observed wave, surface elevation and tidal current. Further, wave characteristic and wave energy resources were analyzed and the results showed that the spatial distribution of wave field was nearly coincident with an isobath, and gradually decreased from the outer sea to the coastal zones. The 10-year averaged significant wave height in the sea was about 0.6-0.8 m, and wave energy density was 2.0-2.8 kW/m. For the latter, we observed a significant difference with the seasons, the energy density being stronger in winter up to 6.5 kW/m, and weaker in summer with no more than 1.0 kW/m. Evaluation of tidal current energy resources showed a micro-tidal zone, and relatively weak tidal current energy. Tidal current energy density of the test field closed to the island was relatively stronger than that observed in the north, with the maximum tidal energy density of about 125-200 W/m(2), which could only be used to test small-scale tidal energy converters.

TI  - HVDC Transmission System Architectures and Control - A Review
AB  - High-voltage dc (HVDC) is an attractive alternative to conventional ac transmission for offshore wind farms as well as bulk power transmission application. This paper reviews different HVDC architectures and their control methods for systems based on both conventional line commutated converters (LCC) and new voltage-source converters (VSC). The reviewed system architectures include both point-to-point and multiterminal connections, such as parallel and series systems. The control methods are introduced in a way that highlights their development and various practical considerations each new method was intended to address. Comparison of the different methods focuses on steady-state characteristics, as dynamic characteristics and stability have been treated separately in the literature for specific systems.

TI  - Performance analysis of floating buoy point absorber: In perspective of variability reduction
AB  - Solar, wind and other forms of renewable energy have impact on lands. Production of wave energy from the waves is in places where there are the least impacts on the environment. Since generation of this energy is in the ocean, it does not interfere with human settlement. Wave energy is not only environment friendly but also beneficial to land impact. Therefore, this form of energy produces electrical power without any relocation. Considering the load side power requirement, the generated power consist high degree of variability. So, for a large scale generation of power and a feasible design, only one converter is not enough rather installation of multiple number of converters are needed. This paper targets the variation of output power and explores the methods to reduce it. The objective of this paper is to reduce the variability by setting up an array of wave energy converters.

TI  - An assessment of available ocean current hydrokinetic energy near the North Carolina shore
AB  - Ocean currents have the potential to supply electricity from a renewable source to coastal regions. The assessment of the potential energy that could be generated is the first step towards developing this resource. Data from the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) and high-frequency radar measurements have been used to assess an area extending from 34.85Â° N to 35.15Â°N, and from 74.85Â°W to 74.5Â°W near the North Carolina shore. The assessment shows the area to exhibit a power density of at least 500W/m2 in over 50% of the days and 1000W/m2 or higher one third of the studied period. The results also show the direction of the ocean velocity to be very uniform in the northeast direction, which would facilitate a future exploitation of the resource. In addition, statistical analysis applying Weibull, Rayleigh, and Gaussian distributions is also presented. It is shown that the use of a Weibull probability distribution facilitates the analysis of ocean velocity conditions and is also able to predict the power density with a high degree of accuracy.

TI  - IMPACT OF TERRESTRIAL WIND FARMS ON DIURNAL RAPTORS: DEVELOPING A SPATIAL VULNERABILITY INDEX AND POTENTIAL VULNERABILITY MAPS
AB  - Impact of terrestrial wind farms on diurnal raptors: developing a spatial vulnerability index and potential vulnerability maps. The use of wind energy resources is currently increasing worldwide as a method of obtaining renewable and non-polluting energy. Nevertheless, wind energy development has several potential adverse effects on avian communities. Therefore, suitable location for futures wind farms seems critical to minimise adverse effects on birds. In this study we adapted the indices proposed by Garthe and Hupop (2004) for offshore wind farms to a terrestrial wind farm as a method to identify more sensitive raptors and to detect high vulnerability areas for wind farms. We constructed two indices: a raptor sensitivity index (RSI) and a spatial vulnerability index (SVI). The RSI included seven factors derived from the attributes of species that have been considered important in assessing the impact of wind farms on birds. Using an RSI and relative habitat use estimation, an SVI was calculated and a potential vulnerability map was produced for Boqueron mountain range in Valencia region. Golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos. short-toed eagle Circaetus gallicus and booted eagle Hieraaetus pennants, together with other species such as griffon vulture Gyps fulvus were the more sensitive species to wind farm. The SVI distinguished zones in which either the elimination or change of position of turbines might reduce the impact of the wind farm foreseen. The SVI might be a useful tool for environmental impact assessment (EIA) to select the best location of new terrestrial wind farms or the sections of them.

TI  - Optimal sizing of Wind/Solar/Hydro in an isolated power system using SMUGF based FPA
AB  - Renewable Energy Resources like Wind, Solar, Biomass, Tidal, Hydropower and Geothermal constitute a type of power generation and received much attention as alternatives for conventional power generation. Renewable Energy Resources (RER) will help to mitigate the emission of green house gases. In this paper, a study on reliability constrained optimization of an isolated power system is carried out. It consists of 25-kW Wind unit, 10-kW solar unit and 10-kW Hydro unit. Hourly speed of wind, solar radiation and water discharge and load profile is obtained using data synthesizer. Firstly, combined Semi-Markov and Universal Generating Function (SMUGF) models for the wind speed, solar irradiation, water availability and load profile with transitions among all states are formulated. Then the reliability constraint Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) is obtained from Aggregate SMUGF model. The objective function with cost and number of units and reliability constraint is formulated. Cost minimization and optimal sizing is performed using Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA). All the above analysis is carried out in MATLAB 2014b software. A comparison of results between the algorithms will be presented and analyzed. Â© 2016 IEEE.

TI  - A coupled blade element momentum - Computational fluid dynamics model for evaluating tidal stream turbine performance
AB  - A modelling approach based on blade element momentum theory is developed for the prediction of tidal stream turbine performance in the ocean environment. Through the coupling of the blade element momentum method with computational fluid dynamics, the influence of upstream hydrodynamics on rotor performance is accounted for. Incoming flow onto the rotor can vary in speed and direction compared to free-stream conditions due to the presence of obstructions to the flow in the upstream, due to other devices for example, or due to the complexity of natural bathymetries. The relative simplicity of the model leads to short run times and a lower demand on computational resources making it a useful tool for considering more complex engineering problems consisting of multiple tidal stream turbines. Results from the model compare well against both measured data from flume experiments and results obtained using the classical blade element momentum model. A discussion considering the advantages and disadvantages of these different approaches is included. Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc.

This study uses multiple examples of the same generator bearing failure to provide insight into how condition monitoring systems can be used in to train machine learning algorithms with the ultimate goal of predicting failure and remaining useful life. Results show that by analysing high-frequency vibration data and extracting key features to train support vector machine algorithms, an accuracy of 67\% can be achieved in successfully predicting failure 1-2 months before occurrence. This study reflects on the limitations surrounding a generalised training approach, taking advantage of all available data, showing that if too many different examples are considered of different wind turbines and operating conditions, the overall accuracy can be diminished.

TI  - North Seas Offshore Network (NSON): Challenges and its way forward
AB  - Serving a twofold purpose, integrated offshore grids can facilitate the connection of offshore wind generation with onshore networks as well as the interconnection of asynchronous market areas for power trade. With a growing amount of offshore wind generation being deployed in Northern Europe, the relevance of a North Seas Offshore Network (NSON) increases, particularly in light of high cross-sectoral decarbonisation targets. To investigate future deployments of offshore grids in the North Seas, the national NSON project in Germany developed a closely linked modelling chain involving several stages: market- and technologybased grid planning, offshore grid validation, and onshore grid repercussions. Following an introduction to the NSON Initiative, a comprehensive overview of the modelling stages is given. Important subjects for further research which could be identified while working on the NSONDE project are discussed afterwards. Main issues include flexibility and uncertainty in future energy systems, market integration, cost-benefit sharing, as well as robust grid planning and enhanced grid operation methods, especially for combined AC/DC-networks.

TI  - Evaluating the gravity wave energy potential off the Brazilian coast
AB  - The wave energy potential on the Brazilian coast is estimated using in-situ buoy data and model data. The results present a greater potential on the southern-southeastern coast than on the northeastern coast, but the variance is also larger. These seem to be associated with the different atmospheric regimes. While in the northeastern portion the trade winds determine the wave regime, in the south the passage of cold front systems plays a major role. For almost all regions and throughout the year, the energy potential oscillates between 10 and 30 kW/m, the most efficient range to implement wave energy converters. The occurrence of sea states is also assessed, showing that the passage of cold front systems also creates different sea states in the S-SW area. Finally, the most common sea states and energy flux are estimated, showing a shift towards longer periods and higher waves for the latter. On the S-SW coast, although the most frequent sea states have waves with periods around 8 s, the energy flux has a more balanced distribution between these and the waves with periods around 11s, the common period for waves generated by cold front systems. This result shows that the most common sea state is not necessarily the one that should be considered when planning wave energy converters for the region.

TI  - Development of vertical axis marine current turbine rotor
AB  - The vast freely available ocean energy has always been a challenge to marine engineers. Tremendous amount of effort to harness the energy has been put by the engineers, designers, and researcher in this field. Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) has embarked on research work in ocean renewable energy to find a suitable device for Malaysian sea conditions. This paper presents current progress on development of devices to extract one of the potential sources of ocean energy in Malaysia viz. marine current energy. Marine current turbines devices normally use either vertically or horizontally mounted rotating rotors. Most of these devices are unsuitable for Malaysian sea condition, by virtue of its low current speeds and shallow water. The work reported in this paper involves the development of a Vertical Axis Marine Current Turbine (VAMCT) rotor using a concept similar to those used in wind energy applications but hitherto never used in VAMCT. The paddle-type turbine is proposed and factors affecting its performance are investigated. These include overlap ratio, number of paddle and stacking configurations. CFD simulation identified the configuration with the highest average torque. Model experiments were carried out to confirm the results. The prototype paddle type turbine is expected to produce up to 8.64 MWh per year in 1.1 knots average current speeds.

TI  - Overview strategy of wind farm in VSC-HVDC power transmission
AB  - The VSC-HVDC system performance has the most competitive and new feasible solution for integration of high wind penetration at offshore sites for efficient power transmission. This paper presents an overview of various control strategy for power converters and the plan of services in VSC-HVDC transmission. For long distance transmission line, reactance limits the transfer capability of high voltage alternating current (HVAC) system. With the advancement of VSC-HVDC technology reactance can be smoothly controlled, hence transfer capability can be enhanced. VSC-HVDC (voltage source converter- high voltage direct current) technology also meets the challenges that are faced by 2-level and multilevel converters. Rapid developments in IGBT open new gate for controlled strategy in converters. Due to this there is a paradigms shift in interfacing renewable energy with electric power system. The real and reactive power can be controlled indepedently by using VSC-HVDC system and black start capability is restored by an AC grid. This paper lays focus on VSC-HVDC transmission technology with integration offshore wind power. It will help operating engineers, designers, and research scholars to focus on this work and decision making. VSC-HVDC transmissions are giving ease of belongingness to energy transition.

AB  - The wind electricity production was considered in conjunction with the electricity requirements of a solar evaporation salt plant. The case of a future application in a small island of the Aegean sea was examined and a framework for evaluating the needs of the combined operation for the salt plant and the wind generators was established. It was shown that for wind power production to have a successful penetration in small isolated electricity grids, together with the installation of new electricity consuming plants, careful planning is needed. Wind energy has a vast potential, but its wide introduction must be preceded by step-by-step analysis of the ever increasing energy demand, its monthly variation and the possibility of utilizing it for other activities that match its time profile.

TI  - Offshore trinidad AWAC wave data assessment
AB  - To support and facilitate deep-water operations, accurate measurements of metocean conditions are needed to assess constraints and provide criteria for offshore design and installation. BHP Billiton installed three deep-water (1,770-2J 20m). taut-line moorings for 12-months in 2014-201 5, offshore Trinidad and Tobago measuring waves, currents, salinity, and temperature to accomplish this task. An associated metocean analysis was performed on the Acoustic Wave And Current (AWAC) sensor data, with supporting Navy Global Environmental Model wind data. The objective of this study was to analyze the AWAC data to understand the wave climate in the region, and specifically, to perform a wave partitioning analysis to compute time-evolving wind-sea and swell wave system parameters. The data set was then used to check analyses and predictions made in the development of operational and extreme metocean design and operational criteria. Taut-line moorings can periodically respond to forcing, dependant on mooring length, mass, buoyancy and drag, which can negatively influence measured directional wave characteristics. Analysis found that the natural mooring response frequency to periodic forcing was in the range of 140 s, outside the range of wave or current variability in the region. Wind roses verify the predominance of easterly wind How with corresponding waves roughly aligned. Bulk significant wave heights appear normally distributed with a median wave height of approximately 1.4 m. Peak periods are predominately 8-9 s, with occasional wave events to approximately 18 s period. Wave directions arc east-northeast to cast most commonly, and most energetic during winter and spring. There is an absence of waves from the south and west due to the blocking effects of Trinidad and South America. Peak wave events were identified with a peaks-ovcr-Thrcshold algorithm, for Ms > 1.5 sigma above the mean, showing a maximum event with Hs = 4.0 m and Tp = 10.6 s. and three events with Tp > 13 s at all 3 moorings with directions mostly from the northeast. Wave spectra directional distributions at higher frequencies appeared compromised as a result of instrument deployment depths, affecting the horizontal spacing of near surface velocity cells used in internal AWAC processing. Modified spectral partitioning with high-frequency masking was developed to eliminate suspect frequencies from the analysis. Partitioning used an inverse watershed algorithm to isolate peak domains in directional wave spectra. Wind sea peaks were identified using directional wave age criterion. Wave component clustering was used to form time-evolving systems from the partition results. Resulting wave systems can be traced to a specific generation region on the ocean surface. Wave vector history plots showed that the Trinidad wave field was typically a mixed sea and regional swell field with occasional long- period swell events from distant storms.

TI  - Modeling and Experimental Investigation on Performance of a Wave Energy Converter with Mechanical Power Take-Off
AB  - This paper presents an experimental investigation on the hydrodynamic performance and energy conversion efficiency of an efficient wave energy converter using a simple conceptual design. The system is based on a mechanical device power take-off (PTO) so-called a bidirectional rotary motion converter (BRMC), which can absorb wave energy by converting bidirectional motion of ocean waves into one-way rotation of an electric generator. First, a prototype system is designed, fabricated and assembled in the Research Institute of Small & Medium Shipbuilding (RIMS). The tests are carried out under different conditions, such as wave profiles, the resistive load coefficients and supplementary masses. A wave simulator is controlled to make harmonic waves with different amplitudes and frequencies. Metal plates are added and fixed on the buoy as supplementary masses. Closed-loop torque control has been applied on the Magneto-Rheological (MR) brake to simulate the induced torque of an electric generator. Moreover, the rotary angle compared to vertical direction, is adjusted to investigate the influence of surge mode and heave mode combination on the absorption energy. The output power is calculated and compared with maximum theoretical absorbed power in heave mode to evaluate the efficiency of the prototype under different conditions. Finally, at optimum condition, the efficiency of the PTO system can reach 80.4% including frictional loss, and the capture width ratio is up to 41.6%.

TI  - A basic study on construction and control of offshore wind power generation system
AB  - As one of the renewable and clean energy resources, wind power is attracting considerable attention and becoming most developing renewable energy resources due to its large unit capacity, etc. However, in some areas of the world, such as in Japan, there are some geographical and electrical restrictions for land wind generation. Since few suitable construction sites can be found and the power system near to the wind farm is too weak to sustain the power fluctuation caused by wind power, the introduction of large amount of land wind power tends to be extremely difficulty and even impossible. In this case, offshore wind farm is a good and only way to increase the wind power generation. For this purpose, a basic research of offshore wind generation system is done in this study for identifying its fundamental behaviors. In this paper, the preparation of offshore data for conducting simulation, the basic study on its construction, the method of power transmission and the control of power equipments of an offshore wind generation system, with which a self-commutated HVDC transmission system is adopted to transmit wind power from offshore to land, are investigated and presented.

TI  - Denmark extends renewables standard to 100% by 2050
AB  - Denmark's parliament has approved an energy strategy that would require 100% of the country's power to be produced by renewables. Under this strategy could result in reducing by 34% its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, compared to 1990 levels, and decreasing energy consumption by > 12%, compared to 2006. Denmark could also supply 52% of its total energy from renewables by 2020 - and produces 100% of its energy from renewables by 2050. The effort would mean Denmark will need to phase out all its coal-fired power plants in the midterm - a fleet that provides 44% of its generating capacity. Denmark already sources 20% of its power from wind turbines, but it has virtually no hydropower or nuclear plants, and it is still heavily dependent on coal-fired generation. Denmark's total installed capacity in 2009 was 12,808 Mw, âˆ¼ 9,316 Mw of which was fossil fuel capacity. The new energy strategy calls for wind power to account for 50% of power consumption, compared to the current 25%, and requires installation of 15,000 Mw of new offshore wind.

TI  - Wave energy resource assessment in Uruguay
AB  - Marine energy sources are an untapped resource able to make a significant contribution to renewable and clean energy generation. In Uruguay, investment in renewable energy has experienced strong growth in recent years. Because the country is located in a microtidal zone, wave energy is the most promising marine energy resource. An assessment of its potential was conducted from a 31-year wave hindcast performed with the Wavewatch IIIÂ® third-generation wave model forced by CFSR (Climate Forecast System Reanalysis) winds. The model was calibrated and validated with altimeter data and in situ measurements. The spatial distribution of the resource and its variability at different timescales were analyzed, as well as the correlation between the variability of the directional wave spectrum and several climate indexes. The extreme conditions that a wave energy converter should withstand were analyzed, and a new figure was defined to quantify the impact of extreme conditions on WEC (Wave energy converter) design and optimization. The obtained results show that although wave energy potential is moderate, it is fairly steady throughout the year, and the extreme waves are relatively benign. Therefore, wave energy is an attractive resource for integration into the country energy mix, contributing to its diversification and sustainability. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A progressive study into offshore wind farm maintenance optimisation using risk based failure analysis
AB  - Offshore Wind Farm consists of an array of Wind Turbines electrical, communication, command and control systems. At present the cost of maintaining Wind Turbines in the offshore locations is very high (about 35\% of lifetime costs). This work puts emphasis on using failure analysis as a basis for designing a condition based prognostic maintenance plan in order to control cost of power and make maintenance more efficient. An essential aspect of such failure analysis is to identify wind turbine components, ascertain their failures and find root causes of the failures. However as a first step, identification of prominent failures in the critical assemblies of a wind turbine using available inspection methods and making provisions to control their occurrence would make significant contribution in improving wind turbine reliability. This work introduces Failure Modes Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) as an important failure analysis tool that has in the past successfully benefitted the airlines, marine, nuclear and spacecraft industries. FMECA is a structured failure analysis technique that can also evaluate the risk and priority number of a failure and hence assist in prioritising maintenance works. The work shows, how with a slight modification of the existing FMECA method, a very useful failure analysis method can be developed for offshore wind turbines including its operational uniqueness.

TI  - PISA design methods for offshore wind turbine monopiles
AB  - This paper provides an overview of the PISA design model recently developed for laterally loaded offshore wind turbine monopiles through a major European joint-industry academic research project, the PISA Project. The focus was on large diameter, relatively rigid piles, with low length to diameter (L/D) ratios, embedded in clay soils of different strength characteristics, sand soils of different densities and in layered soils combining clays and sands. The resulting design model introduces new procedures for site specific calibration of soil reaction curves that can be applied within a one-dimensional (1D), Winkler-type, computational model. This paper summarises the results and key conclusions from PISA, including design methods for (a) stiff glacial clay till (Cowden till), (b) brittle stiff plastic clay (London clay), (c) soft clay (Bothkennar clay), (d) sand of varying densities (Dunkirk), and, (e) layered profiles (combining soils from (a) to (d)). The results indicate that the homogeneous soil reaction curves applied appropriately for layered profiles in the 1D PISA design model provide a very good fit to the three-dimensional finite element (3D FE) calculations, particularly for profiles relevant to current European offshore wind farm sites. Only a small number of cases, involving soft clay, very dense sand and L/D = 2 monopiles, would appear to require more detailed and bespoke analysis. Â© 2019, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - Configuring floating production networks: A case study of a new offshore wind technology across two oil and gas economies
AB  - The authors employ the global production network (GPN) approach to analyse the development of the renewable energy sector. Through a case study of the development of a Hywind floating offshore wind project (Hywind) across two oil and gas economies, namely Norway and Scotland, the paper sheds light on the key drivers and role of core GPN actors. Methodologically, the authors investigate the process from both â€˜inside-outâ€™ and â€˜outside-inâ€™ perspectives, referring to the efforts of firms expanding into overseas markets and the efforts of host countries to attract investment from outside their territories. The analysis shows how the configuration of extractive production networks is shaped by the interactions between the network development practices of firms and the market development strategies of host states. The authors conclude that the distinct materiality of floating wind power technology shapes the territorial configuration of the production network by enabling its spatial extension across a range of locations. By contrast, existing research on other extractive sectors has emphasized the spatially constraining effects of materiality (Bridge 2008). Â© 2018, Â© 2018 Norwegian Geographical Society.

TI  - Water use of the UK thermal electricity generation fleet by 2050: Part 2 quantifying the problem
AB  - The increasing demand for energy is expected to predominantly be met from a global expansion of water intensive thermal electricity generation. Most countries will in future have less freshwater available when inevitability the cost of thermal generation depends on water availability. A country's future energy costs will directly affect its future global competiveness. Many studies have identified that the solution to the UK's future energy policy's mismatch between thermal generation and freshwater availability is for the UK to make greater use of its seawater resource. The fact the UK with a long learning curve of successful nuclear coastal generation is not progressing coastal generation more enthusiastically raises fundamental policy questions. This paper considers the issues involved. A methodology is developed to assess how the UK's electricity generation portfolio will change in terms of the technologies adopted, and their cost, as access to seawater is varied under Q70 and Q95 freshwater conditions. It was found the emphasis UK energy policy gives to the competing demands of low cost electricity generation and environmental protection will have significant impacts on the cost and make-up of the UK's future electricity generation portfolio.

TI  - Fatigue life of pitch- and stall-regulated composite tidal turbine blades
AB  - Tidal turbine blades are subject to harsh loading and environmental conditions, including large thrust and torsional loadings, relative to wind turbine blades, due to the high density of seawater, among other factors. The complex combination of these loadings, as well as water ingress and associated composite laminate saturation, have significant implications for blade design, affecting overall device design, stability, scalability, energy production and cost-effectiveness. This study investigates the effect of seawater ingress on composite material properties, and the associated design and life expectancy of tidal turbine blades in operating conditions. The fatigue properties of dry and water-saturated glass fibre reinforced laminates are experimentally evaluated and incorporated into tidal blade design. The fatigue lives of pitch- and stall-regulated tidal turbine blades are found to be altered by seawater immersion. Water saturation is shown to reduce blade life about 3 years for stall-regulated blades and by about 1-2 years for pitch-regulated blades. The effect of water ingress can be compensated by increased laminate thickness. The tidal turbine blade design methodology presented here can be used for evaluation of blade life expectancy and tidal device energy production. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Kuchinoshima Island ocean current measurements for Kuroshio Current energy
AB  - Ocean currents were observed near Kuchinoshima Island, a potential installation site for a current energy converter development project to harness the energy of the Kuroshio Current. Field measurements were taken for a range of frequencies and vertical positions using both Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) instruments. Using these tools to measure the current, we use velocity statistics to analyze the ocean current characteristics and metrics including turbulence intensity, turbulent kinetic energy, and coherent turbulent kinetic energy which are known to influence the behavior of current turbines. Spectral analysis is then used to show the various scales of fluctuation in the ocean current. The spectral range was on the order of 10-3 Hz to 2 or 8 Hz based on the limitations of the observation campaign duration and the ADCP and ADV specifications. Â© 2016 IEEE.

TI  - Application of VMEA to assess uncertainties affecting tidal devices: Preliminary findings using tank-scale turbines
AB  - This paper presents initial findings from the application of Variation Mode and Effect Analysis (VMEA) to two tidal energy devices, in the context of the MONITOR (Multi-Model Investigation of Tidal Energy Converter Reliability) project. VMEA is an engineering tool used to identify and understand sources of variation or uncertainty, which could affect reliability of a device or component. Understanding and controlling sources of variation can allow identification of methods to reduce their impact and improve reliability. In this work we consider uncertainties affecting loading on the blades of tidal turbines. Results from tank scale testing of two different turbines are used to investigate the sensitivity of blade loading to a range of uncertainties, including inflow velocity, turbulence intensity, operating speed, and blade geometry. Initial learnings from the application of VMEA to tidal devices are discussed. Â© 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

TI  - Constructal design applied to geometric shapes analysis of wave energy converters
AB  - This paper deals with numerical simulation and the geometrical analysis of an ocean Wave Energy Converter (WEC), which has as the operating principle the Oscillating Water Column (OWC). The goal was to evaluate the geometric shape influence of the OWC chamber in the hydropneumatic power available. Therefore, four geometric shapes were analyzed: I) Rectangle (RT), ii) Trapezium (TP), iii) Inverted Trapezium (TI) and iv) Double Trapezium (DT). For this, the OWC device was subject to a JONSWAP wave spectrum with peak period (TS) equal to 7.5 s and peak wave height (HS) equal to 1.5 m. To do so, Constructal Design was employed varying the Degree Of Freedom (DOF) HI/L (ratio between the height and length of the OWC chamber entrance). The problem constraints were the entrance area and the total area of the OWC chamber that were kept constant. For the numerical solution a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code, based on the Finite Volume Method (FVM),de0 was used. The multiphase Volume of Fluid (VOF) model was applied to tackle with the water-air interaction. The results indicated that when the Rectangle (RT) geometrical shape was employed an improvement of nearly 99% was achieved. Â© 2021 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.

TI  - Offshore wind energy research trajectory and trends
AB  - Offshore wind power (OWP) is an important green technology owing to its stability and sites for OWP projects (wind farms) are easily obtainable. The authors reviewed 2,217 papers collected from Scopus and used main path analysis (a citation analysis method) to determine the trends in OWP studies. Based on their analysis, they categorized some OWP concepts, including wind farm model, wind farm monitoring, wind speed measurement and analysis, cost and economic analysis, and floating OWP. Furthermore, they found that OWP can be combined with a wave energy unit to generate stable electric power. It is important to monitor the wind turbines of large OWP plants, and OWP plants should be located far from the shore. In this case, floating OWP is more economical than fixed OWP. In addition, high-voltage direct current (HVDC) is more feasible then high-voltage alternating current (HVAC) in terms of cost and stability. However, the magnetic effect of OWP on fishes, plants, and fishermen is uncertain. The European Union plans to install OWP capacity of 40 GW by 2020 and 150 GW by 2030. The results of this study can guide policy making and investment decisions. Â© 2018 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, Inc. (PICMET).

TI  - Wind energy generation from Nigeria continental shelf: A review
AB  - The menace of global warming and increase of green-house gases have motivated many countries to embrace renewable energy sources as an alternative to fossil fuels. Some of the means by which sustainable energy is tapped are solar, biofuel, and wind. Wind energy have been around for quite some time and the power in the wind have been harnessed on land. However, due to some constraints related to land use, visual impacts and turbulence induced by buildings and trees, offshore wind farms have been engaged to provide quality alternative to onshore wind energy. This study reviews various works that have been done in the offshore wind development and tries to make a case for the generation of electricity from this type of renewable energy source to boost the nation's electricity demand. Work done in offshore energy assessment, wake models, offshore turbine layout, future innovation in offshore wind turbine and Nigeria onshore energy scenario were reviewed. To speed up development of offshore wind energy in Nigeria, recommendation was made for government to invest in wind energy research, industries that operate in the offshore region should be willing to share meteorological data with researchers and tertiary institutions should encourage student to work on "issue-based" projects like proffering solution to the energy deficit crisis in the country.

TI  - Influence of an improved sea-state description on a wave energy converter production
AB  - Sea-states are usually described by a single set of 5 parameters, no matter the actual number of wave systems they contain. We present an original numerical method to extract from directional spectra the significant systems constituting of a complex sea-state. An accurate description of the energy distribution is then given by multiple sets of parameters. We use these results to assess the wave climatology in the Bay of Biscay and to estimate the power harnessable in this area by a particular Wave Energy Converter, the SEAREV. Results show that the fine description of sea-states yields a better assessment of the instantaneous device response. The discrepancy between the classical and multi-sets descriptions show that the new one is preferable for the assessment of harnessable power and for device design.

TI  - Sun: The main source of ground energy and power
AB  - Fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas are sources of energy generated from plants after millions of years through a number of chemical reactions inside the ground. Until now, most energy demands have been fulfilled by these worldwide nonregenerative fossil fuels. However, a colorless gas, carbon dioxide (CO2), is produced from the burning of fossil fuels to fulfill the demand of industrial civilization. CO2 creates a layer in the lower atmospheric zone that traps sunlight and makes the Earth as a heat chamber. As a consequence of global warming, a greenhouse effect has already been observed at sea level. Alternative energy sources can play a vital role to overcome oil-based effects on the Earth's surface. These days, sunlight is used to generate other forms of energy, such as photovoltaic and solar thermal systems. However, sunlight creates another form of renewable energy known as wind energy. In principle, radiation of sunlight reflects on the surface through uneven heating, which creates the ground surface wind flow. The wind flow is then transformed into electric energy by the movement of turbines with the help of highly sophisticated technological devices. To avail the power and maintain generated power efficiency, wind turbines are categorized into offshore and onshore generators, which contribute a significant percentage of energy to fulfill the net energy demand. Sunlight is also a source of wave energy, which creates dynamic waves by the interaction with water and air molecules. In this chapter, different forms of sunlight- dependent renewable energy sources are discussed in detail. It also demonstrates how much power has been generated from each source and predicts the future power demand for renewable energy sources. Â© 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluating energy loss with the entropy production theory: A case study of a micro horizontal axis river ducted turbine
AB  - Hydrokinetic power as a clean renewable energy has been aroused a widespread concern. Horizontal axis turbines are widely used in the field of tidal and river current energy power generation, but their internal flow loss characteristics have not been fully revealed. In this paper, a micro horizontal axis river ducted turbine is taken as the research object, and the flow loss characteristics of the turbine under different yaw angles and tip clearances are analyzed by numerical simulation method combined with entropy production theory. A detailed entropy production analysis shows that most of the energy losses take place near the blade tip, at the outlet of the duct, and in the downstream wake region. The turbulent dissipation is the main cause of entropy generation in the ducted turbine. Results demonstrated that with the increase of the yaw angle, the power coefficient Cp increases first, and then reduces. The Cp is up to maximum at Î¸ = 10Â°. When Î¸ = 25Â°, the maximum value of Cp decreased by 24.8%, compared with Î¸ = 10Â°. It is also suggested that there is no obvious negative effect to shaft work and power coefficient for ducted turbine under certain yaw environment (Î¸ â‰¤ 10Â°) and the optimal tip clearance should be between 0.02D and 0.04D.

TI  - Wireless Monitoring and Spectral Analysis of a 3kW Wind Turbine for Condition Monitoring
AB  - The operation and maintenance (O\&M) costs associated with wind turbines are comparatively high due to the size and complexity of large wind turbine systems. Remote and harsh field locations such as offshore wind farms can further rise those costs. There is a clear need to instrument wind turbines to monitor their behavior to identify damage and deterioration in an effort to lower O\&M costs. Towards this end, this study focuses on the deployment of a low-cost wireless monitoring system on a 3kW wind turbine tower to monitor the behavior of the tower under various operational states. Acceleration data and its spectral representation is used to ascertain the normal (undamaged) behavior of the wind turbine under varying environmental and operational conditions.

TI  - Optimisation of offshore wind farm cable connection layout considering levelised production cost using dynamic minimum spanning tree algorithm
AB  - The approach in this study has been developed to optimise the cable connection layout of large-scale offshore wind farms. The objective is to minimise the levelised production cost (LPC) of an offshore wind farm by optimising the cable connection configuration. On the basis of the minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm, an improved algorithm, the dynamic MST algorithm is proposed. The current carrying capacity of the cable is considered to be the main constraint and the cable sectional area is changed dynamically. An irregular shaped wind farm is chosen as the studied case and the results are compared with the layout obtained by a traditional MST algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed method is an effective way for offshore wind farm collection system layout design.

TI  - The development of hybrid integrated renewable energy system (wind and solar) for sustainable living at Perhentian Island, Malaysia
AB  - The precedent of the world oil crisis in 1970s and the recent emerging condition of high soaring prices of oil powerfully illustrated that the concerns over the energy resources which exposed the vulnerability of the energy supply and the over dependence on oil as a fuel for energy. This conditions lead to the necessity for the diversification of energy resources. The government strategies of achieving national energy objectives which among others are diversification of fuel type sources, technology, maximise use of indigenous energy resources and minimizing negative environment impact. The Renewable Energy Policy Network, REN(2007), reported that the potential wind energy generating capacity has increased by 28 percent and the solar energy surged to 52 percent. The energy efficiency and renewable energy under the Eight Malaysia Plan (2001 - 2005) and Ninth Malaysian Plan (2006 - 2010) focused on targeting for renewable energy to be significant contributor and for better utilization of energy resources. An emphasis to further reduce the dependency on petroleum provides for more effort to integrate alternative source of energy. Aware at the potential of the harvesting the wind energy, Malaysian Government under Joint venture partnership with the State Government of Terengganu and National Electric Board in 2007 embark on the project of integrating power supply at Pulau Perhentian (Perhentian Island).

TI  - THE FIRST FULL OPERATIVE U-OWC PLANTS IN THE PORT OF CIVITAVECCHIA
AB  - The Resonant Wave Energy Converter 3 (REWEC3) is a wave energy converter belonging to the family of Oscillating Water Columns (OWCs). It comprises an oscillating water column and an air pocket connected to a turbine, as for traditional OWCs. In addition, it has a small vertical U-shaped duct used for connecting the water column to the open wave field. Because of this particular geometrical configuration, it is also known as U-Oscillating Water Column (U-OWC). During the past decade, small scale field experiments and theoretical analyses proved its potential for full scale applications. Currently, a full-scale prototype has been operating in the Port of Civitavecchia (Rome, Italy), where a REWEC3 was constructed within the context of a major port enlargement.

TI  - Numerical model validation for mooring systems: Method and application for wave energy converters
AB  - The design of wave energy mooring systems is challenging: overdesign incurs a significant cost penalty, underdesign may lead to a premature failure and incorrect design could reduce the power production. Consequently, compliant mooring systems are being developed for wave energy applications.This paper presents tank test results for a scale model of the buoy and mooring used at the South West Mooring Test Facility (SWMTF), an offshore facility developed to conduct long-term sea trials for wave energy device moorings. A compliant three leg catenary mooring system using Nylon ropes in the water column is investigated. Preliminary static, quasi-static, decay, regular and irregular wave tests were conducted on the 1:5 scale model, using the Ifremer basin in Brest. A corresponding numerical model was developed with a time-domain mooring modelling tool, inputting hydrodynamic data from a radiation/diffraction potential modelling program.After the calibration of several hydrodynamic parameters, the numerical model demonstrated good agreement with the experiment. However, numerical results show large differences with the field test results, mainly because of unknowns in the anchor position. The methods and procedures presented will allow the effective validation of numerical models to enable the development of appropriate mooring systems in wave energy applications.

TI  - Wind power production from very large offshore wind farms
AB  - We provide the first quantitative assessment of power production and wake generation from offshore wind energy lease areas along the U.S. east coast. Deploying 15-MW wind turbines, with spacing equal to the European average, yields electricity production of 116 TWh/year or 3\% of current national supply. However, power production is reduced by one-third due to wakes caused by upwind wind turbines and wind farms. Under some flow conditions whole wind-farm wakes can extend up to 90 km downwind of the largest lease areas, and the frequency-weighted average area with a 5\% velocity deficit is 2.6 times the footprint of the lease areas. Simulations including maritime corridors demonstrate reduction in the wake effects leading to power-efficiency gains and may offer contingent benefits. First-order scaling rules are developed that describe how ``wake shadows'' from large offshore wind farms scale with prevailing meteorology and wind turbine installed densities.

First, by incorporating the advantages of the integrated offshore wind turbine and the installation method for suction bucket foundation, the idea of integrated floating and quick installation based on a four-bucket jacket foundation was proposed. Second, the process of integrated wet towing of the four-bucket jacket foundation was described, which was further verified via indoor model experiments and numerical simulations. Results show that under 2 m wave height and level 5 sea conditions, the proposed four-bucket jacket foundation can be wet towed and floated at a speed of 5 knots under the optimum draft depth.

TI  - Simulation model to assess electrical power generation from tidal basin in coastal area of Malaysia
AB  - This article studies the numerical simulation of power generation in four different tidal stations in the East Coast region of Malaysia. The tidal stations are Tanjung Sedili, Tanjung Gelang, Tioman and Cendering. The simulation model is based on power generation using tidal barrage. Ebb, flood and double-mode generations were studied. The tidal basin area was estimated by approximation to generate sufficient electricity for local community consumption. Thus, a different basin area was estimated for every location as each location has different population size. Singleflow generation was assumed for ebb and floor generations with 40% barrage efficiency while bidirectional generation was assumed for double-mode generation with 30% barrage efficiency. Double-mode generation has the highest power generation among the three different methods. Tanjung Gelang has the highest average tidal range difference. However, Pulau Tioman is more suitable to have the tidal barrage as the local community population is smaller, thus, requiring a smaller basin area to generate sufficient electricity to meet the demand of local community. On average, tidal barrage with a basin area of 0.3km2 in Pulau Tioman will be able to generate 13.74 GWh annually. Â© (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

TI  - An Assessment of Offshore Wind Energy Potential on Phangan Island by in Southern Thailand
AB  - This research aims to assess the potential of offshore wind energy in Suratthani province, located in the middle of peninsular Thailand. A 120 m Guy Mast triangle tower was installed at the Phangan Subdistrict Administrative Organization area, Phangan Island. Five weather measurement points including wind speed anemometers, relative humidity detectors and dry bulb ambient air thermometers were placed at heights of 65, 90, 100, 110 and 120 m, while the two wind vane detectors were fixed at 100 and 120 m heights. Data were continuously recorded at 10 min sampling intervals, from December 2011 to November 2012. The average wind speed was 4.28 m/s and the mean wind power density was 85 W/m(2). The dominant wind direction was from the north. Based on these data, 9 cases of wind farm layout were simulated to assess their performance. The capacity factors of offshore wind farms were in the range of 0.98-2.68. This suggests that the location and layouts simulated would be poorly utilized investments. However, the higher wind speeds of elevated areas of the island should be similarly assessed. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Estimation of off Shore Wind Power Potential and Cost Optimization of Wind Farm in Indian Coastal Region by Using GAMS
AB  - This paper presented an optimization based analysis to minimize the levelized cost of energy to find the effective cost model based on different offshore wind energy cost parameter. A numerical study is carried out to demonstrate the model. India is fast growing country in the economy but it is still in its initial stage where policy frameworks are formed by MNRE and getting with the tools to enter into the offshore market. The energy potential along the Indian coastal region (Shallow water region i.e. less than 50m water depth) is immense and it is approximately equal to 42% of present wind power capacity. Generation cost of 1 MWh or KWh of electricity is an important consideration for development and operation of any wind farm. This study examines the economic keys regarding cost for offshore wind farms to formulate an effective cost model so that we can get optimal solution for levelized production cost.

TI  - Survey of the largest prefabricated concrete structure of Spain
AB  - Recently two Spanish companies got a contract for the construction of twenty foundation structures for an offshore wind farm that should be installed in the North Sea. The manufacture of these elements requires a considerable area of industrial land, and that is why they rented two of the old naves of the steel factory â€œEnsidesaâ€, a very unique structure, the biggest in our country, with a high degree of prefabrication and a very advanced design for its time (early 50s). The paper describes the current state of these huge naves, including the results of NDT and Destructive Tests (DT) performed on their concrete, after 50 years of construction and major maintenance problems, especially if we consider the aggressiveness environment of the steel plant.

TI  - ON LIFETIME EXTENSION OF WIND TURBINE DRIVETRAINS
AB  - The focused shift to reduce carbon emissions by substituting fossil fuels with renewable energy sources, including wind, is increasing. This means that more and more wind turbines are being installed, both onshore and offshore and as this number increases, more and more turbines are reaching their end of designed service life. Extending this designed service life, which is commonly referred to as lifetime extension (LTE), is particularly favoured by owner/operators, due to economic reasons. Whilst there are relatively well-established practices for lifetime extension of structural members or those preserving structural integrity, the electro-mechanical and drivetrain systems are often overlooked. Therefore, this paper reviews lifetime extension assessment practices executed within a variety of industries, such as oil and gas, marine vessels, electrical machines, mechanical rotating equipment and bearings, to determine if any of these practices can be implemented or adapted within the wind industry, particularly on wind turbine drivetrains.

TI  - Wave energy resource assessment for Northern Spain from a 13-year hindcast
AB  - In order to assess the wave energy potential along the Northern Coast of Spain, two state-of the- art spectral models, WAVEWATCH III and SWAN, were coupled to obtain 13 years (2000-2012) of ocean wave parameters and wave power results. Winds from the ECMWFâ€™s ERA Interim data base were used. In previous studies, the simulated data were directly validated with buoy measurements and statistical results were obtained to evaluate the performance of the wave hindcast system developed. Here, the objective is to evaluate the wave energy potential using the results from the models already validated. Theoretical values of wave power is estimated and its spatial distribution is assessed. A study of its seasonal variability is performed, analyzing the different seasons as well as the annual cycle of the mean wave power, averaged over all the 13 simulated years. The variability of the wave resource is considerable, both in time and space. Mean wave energy values are found to reach over 60 kW/m nearshore, in the wintertime, and in the summer they range between 20 and 40 kW/m. The Bay of Biscay also seems to influence the magnitude of the wave energy values on the northeast coast of Spain. Very high values of wave energy, over 100 kW/m, have a very low probability of occurrence. Â© 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

TI  - Study on hydrodynamic performance of the sealed-buoy wave energy converter
AB  - For investigating the wave energy converter working in low-energy flow density sea area, a novel sealed-buoy wave energy converter (SBWEC) was analysed by using the fluid simulation software ANSYS and AQWA according to Shandong Peninsula marine environment in this paper. For the SBWEC in the range of 5-20 m buoy diameter, the effect of mass on the response amplitude operator (RAO) and the motion response were analysed based on the frequency domain method and the time domain method. The wavelength range with higher wave energy was also investigated. Within the mass range of 8-12 t, the study found that the mass did not has a significant impact on the roll, yaw and pitch RAO and the pitch motion response except for the SBWEC with 5 m buoy diameter. The wavelength range with higher wave energy in Shandong Peninsula is 10-40 m, which is more suitable for operation of the SBWEC. These results can provide a reference for the design of related wave energy converters.

TI  - Assessing boundary condition and parametric uncertainty in numerical-weather-prediction-modeled, long-term offshore wind speed through machine learning and analog ensemble
AB  - To accurately plan and manage wind power plants, not only does the time-varying wind resource at the site of interest need to be assessed but also the uncertainty connected to this estimate. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models at the mesoscale represent a valuable way to characterize the wind resource offshore, given the challenges connected with measuring hub-height wind speed. The boundary condition and parametric uncertainty associated with modeled wind speed is often estimated by running a model ensemble. However, creating an NWP ensemble of long-term wind resource data over a large region represents a computational challenge. Here, we propose two approaches to temporally extrapolate wind speed boundary condition and parametric uncertainty using a more convenient setup in which a mesoscale ensemble is run over a short-term period (1 year), and only a single model covers the desired long-term period (20 year). We quantify hub-height wind speed boundary condition and parametric uncertainty from the short-term model ensemble as its normalized across-ensemble standard deviation. Then, we develop and apply a gradient-boosting model and an analog ensemble approach to temporally extrapolate such uncertainty to the full 20-year period, for which only a single model run is available. As a test case, we consider offshore wind resource characterization in the California Outer Continental Shelf. Both of the proposed approaches provide accurate estimates of the long-term wind speed boundary condition and parametric uncertainty across the region (R-2 > 0.75), with the gradient-boosting model slightly outperforming the analog ensemble in terms of bias and centered root-mean-square error. At the three offshore wind energy lease areas in the region, we find a long-term median hourly uncertainty between 10\% and 14\% of the mean hub-height wind speed values. Finally, we assess the physical variability in the uncertainty estimates. In general, we find that the wind speed uncertainty increases closer to land. Also, neutral conditions have smaller uncertainty than the stable and unstable cases, and the modeled wind speed in winter has less boundary condition and parametric sensitivity than summer.

TI  - Optimal location of series FACTS devices to control line overloads in power systems with high wind feeding
AB  - The planned offshore wind farms in Germany are basically located in North region. For wind integration in Germany, establishing new transmission lines and employing new technologies have become unavoidable. Establishing new transmission lines is very costly and difficult regarding enviromental condition. One of the solutions is the utilization of Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS). This paper discusses a method for determining the placement of series compensation to control line overload in power systems with wind power penetration. By a sensitivity based method critical lines can be identified quickly and accurately, to obtain desired wind feeding into the system. Thyristor Controlled Series Compensator (TCSC) is applied for system stabilization as a typical FACTS devices. This method is applied to realistic scenarios in a test system, which simulates reduced 380 kV network of Germany. Simulation results showed that the proposed method is effective and can enhance the transfer capability margin of existing power systems. Â© 2009 IEEE.

For DC output, the output frequency of the generator can be selected arbitrarily. This paper investigated the optimum excitation condition for the doubly-fed induction generator connected to the dc output. The excitation frequency is changed from positive to negative to search the change of the power condition at the stator and the rotor side. The simulation results show that there is the optimum frequency of the negative sequence excitation for minimizing the rating of the excitation converter.

TI  - Increases in China's wind energy production from the recovery of wind speed since 2012
AB  - China has realized a 56-fold increase in installed wind capacity, from 5.9 GW in 2007 to 328 GW in 2021. In addition to increasing installed capacity, plans to substantially increase wind energy production for climate change mitigation also depend on future wind speeds, which strongly influences the efficiencies of installed turbines within individual wind farms. A reversal in globally decreasing wind speeds over several decades has been reported previously. However, subsequent studies using other data sources reported only a slight increase or no reversal in China. These uncertainties regarding China's wind energy production hamper estimates of wind energy production potential. Here, our analysis of quality-controlled wind speed measurements from in-situ stations shows that the wind speed decline in China reversed significantly since 2012 (P < 0.001), but with substantial spatio-temporal variability. We further estimated the capacity factor (CF) growth and the wind power gain solely associated with the changes in wind speed ranges from 31.6 to 56.5 TWh yr(-1) based on the 2019 installed capacity. This estimate explains 22.0\%-39.3\% of the rapid increase in wind generation CF in China during 2012-2019. The result implies that the site selection of wind farms should consider both current wind situation and future wind speed trends. Further studies are needed to understand the driving factor of wind speed recovery in support of the wind energy industry.

TI  - Assessment of Tidal Current Energy Resources and Its Impact on Surrounding in the Southeast Waters of Zhaitang Island, China
AB  - The sea area to the southeast of Zhaitang Island, located in the east coast of Yellow Sea, China is a potential site for exploiting tidal current energy. Before these resources were developed effectively, assessment on extractable tidal current energy resources and its impact on surrounding are needed. In this paper, a 3D hydrodynamic model of the waters of Zhaitang Island, calibrated and successfully verified with continuous in-situ measured data, was built by Delft 3D-Flow, and the impact to the waters of energy extracted by the turbine array was emulated by adding a momentum loss term in the equations of the model. On this basis, the resource reserve of tidal current energy and its impact on surrounding in the southeast waters of Zhaitang Island could be assessed. The results showed that the power output of the turbine array was expected to reach 691,619kWh in a tidal periodicity (15 days). In addition, water level around the waters was not much influenced by turbine array, albeit large influence area. However, the influence on tidal velocity was relatively clear, and the maximum drop of flow velocity could reach 45cm/s.

TI  - The ICP design method and application to a North Sea offshore wind farm
AB  - This paper outlines the Imperial College Pile (ICP) approach for developing reliable predictions for the axial capacity of driven piles. The ICP's advantages over traditional design methods have led to widespread use in offshore oil and gas developments. The methods are now playing a critical role in major Northern European offshore wind projects. Hundreds of large steel tubular piles are being driven in the North and Baltic seas and improving design efficiency is crucial to the industry's economic success. This paper provides an overview of the development of the ICP design methods and summarizes their key features, together with experience-based guidance on their application. Their application is illustrated by reference to the North Sea Borkum West II wind farm, where 40 turbines have been installed on steel tripods founded on large diameter steel piles driven in very dense sands. The paper reports how the significant effects of axial and lateral cyclic loading were addressed for Borkum West II through the ICP design methodology. Â© ASCE 2015.

TI  - Real time estimation and prediction of wave excitation forces on a heaving body
AB  - Wave energy converters (WECs) face many technical challenges before becoming a cost-competitive source of renewable energy. The levelized cost of electricity could be decreased by implementing real-time control strategies to increase average power produced by a WEC. These control strategies typically require knowledge of the immediate future excitation force, caused by the waves. This paper presents a disturbance prediction methodology that is independent of the local wave climate and can be implemented on a wide range of devices. A time-domain model of a generic heaving WEC is developed with the Cummins equations. The model is simulated with measured water surface elevation data collected off the Oregon Coast. A simplified linear frequency-invariant state-space model is used in conjunction with a Kalman filter to estimate the current excitation force with measurements of the WEC's motion. Future excitation forces are then predicted multiple steps in the future with a recursive least squares filter. The results show this approach makes accurate predictions of excitation force over short time horizons (up to 15 seconds), but accurate predictions become infeasible for longer horizons.

It is shown how the bending moment of model test piles is influenced by horizontal cyclic loading. Furthermore the development of contact pressures below a cyclically loaded shallow foundation for offshore wind turbines is analyzed. A considerable redistribution of the contact pressures was observed and can be explained by the inhomogeneous accumulation of strains due to the cyclic loading. Both effects in different scales (model tests and in situ test) were successfully predicted by numerical simulations using a high cycle accumulation model.

TI  - Energy efficiency of pneumatic power take-off for wave energy converter
AB  - This paper investigates the energy efficiency of a pneumatic power transmission which serves as power take-off for a small-scale, low cost, portable wave energy converter. The wave energy converter was implemented and tested as a prototype in the Eastern Mediterranean. The power transmission uses a standard cylinder as a pump with check valves for flow rectification. Air is stored in an accumulator and discharged through a vane motor coupled to a brushed DC generator which is connected to an electrical load. Numerical models are given for each component of the system which allow to calculate the component and system losses for a range of operating conditions. Experimental results are presented from laboratory tests with the power take-off system. Measurements are conducted at steady state, transient, as well as simulated wave conditions using a hydraulic wave simulator. The measurements validate the predicted losses of the numerical models. The losses in each part of the power transmission are graphically illustrated with a Sankey diagram. We conclude that even though the overall efficiency is low, the setup serves well as a low cost instructional tool to teach principles of wave energy harvesting and to demonstrate typical challenges faced in the design of wave energy converters and pneumatic power transmission.

TI  - Design and implementation of insular microgrid energy management system
AB  - The power generation using rich natural resources is an important measure to solve energy supply problem in an island away from the mainland and without large power grids. It helps to construct an ecological and environmental-protective island, stimulate the development of oceanic economy and tourism industry, and improve life quality of islanders. An architecture of insular microgrid energy management system was designed, and an autonomous microgrid consisting of two kinds of renewable resources (solar and wind energy), battery energy storage system and diesel generator was established in an island on the east coast of China. A desalination unit acts as controllable load, and is put into operation when the power is excess or there is a shortage of fresh water supply. The system monitors the operating conditions of the microgrid in real time, and transmits important running information to remote Distribution Management System (DMS) through the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). The running results show that the insular microgrid energy management system can not only ensure the efficient and stable operation, but also improve the utilization of renewable energy and extend battery life.

TI  - Effect of thickness distribution on performance of S-cambered profiles
AB  - A fully reversible axial flow pump-turbine is a device that can work as a turbine and as a pump for both forward and reverse directions of flow. These machines find applications in tidal power plants. Double-cambered S-shaped profiles are known to be better suited for the blades of such machines; however, information on the aerodynamic characteristics of S-cambered profiles is very limited. The effect of thickness distribution on the performance of S-shaped airfoils is considered in this paper. The results obtained from an extensive experimental aerodynamic investigation of three S-cambered profiles with different thickness distributions are presented. Gottingen 775 and NACA 0010-66 basic thickness distributions were used to obtain these profiles. The profiles were tested in a wind tunnel in forward and reverse directions of flow. The variation of lift and drag coefficients and that of lift-to-drag ratio with angle of attack were obtained. The study showed that among the profiles tested the profile with Gottingen 775 thickness distribution having a maximum thickness at 30% chord is best suited for fully reversible axial pump-turbine application from the point view of high lift-to-drag ratio.

TI  - Danish and Dutch wind energy policy 1970-2000: Lessons for the future
AB  - Both in the Netherlands and in Denmark, policies to develop a wind turbine industry and to install a large wind turbine capacity were started in the 1970s. However, the outcomes of these policies were very different. A flourishing wind turbine industry developed in Denmark, whereas in the Netherlands, a few companies started building wind turbines in the 1980s and 1990s, but presently no wind turbine producers exist. How can this difference be explained? A number of factors can be pinpointed. The main factors are the following: Firstly, different technological choices were made. Secondly, different policies were introduced for wind turbine owners in both countries. Thirdly, the opinion of the utilities regarding wind energy in both countries was very different. Nowadays, both countries are focusing on offshore wind energy. The policy measures that are introduced and the technical choices that are made are path dependent. In other words, they follow from the policy measures and the technical choices in the past. How can the mistakes that were made in the past be avoided and what lessons can be learned for the future? We will elaborate on that in this paper. Copyright Â© 2006 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

TI  - Energy Curtailment Analysis of Offshore Wind Farms with DC Series-parallel Collection Systems
AB  - Voltage balancing among the series connected wind turbines is one of the main technical challenges of offshore wind farms with DC series-parallel collection systems. Due to wake effect considerations, the power generated among the series connected wind turbines does not remain the same and the series connection causes the output voltages of the turbines to be distributed in proportion to their power output. Power curtailment is required in order to prevent the turbines being subjected to over-voltage and under-voltage conditions. In this paper, a voltage adjustment procedure is proposed to eliminate over-voltage and under-voltage of wind turbines. Based on the voltage adjustment procedure and the power generation model of wind turbines, the energy curtailment of a wind farm is analyzed with the consideration of wake effect due to series connection. A case study on several DC series-parallel collection configurations is presented to analyze the energy curtailment of wind farms using the voltage adjustment procedure.

TI  - Modeling the energy yield enhancement from a wind turbine at a deep offshore low wind site through combined power and thermocline energy production
AB  - This paper presents steady-state performance modeling and analysis of a novel wind powered system that concurrently exploits thermocline thermal energy through deep sea water extraction in conjunction with offshore wind energy for combined power and thermal energy production. A single offshore wind turbine rotor directly coupled to a large positive displacement pump is modeled to supply deep sea water at high pressure to a land-based plant, the latter consisting of a hydro-electric generator coupled to a heat exchanger. The steady-state power-wind speed characteristics for the system are derived from a numerical thermofluid model. The latter integrates the hydraulic characteristics of the wind turbine-pump combination and a numerical code to simulate the heat gained/lost by deep sea water as it flows through a pipeline to shore. The model was applied to a hypothetical megawatt-scale wind turbine installed at a deep offshore low wind site in the vicinity of the Central Mediterranean island of Malta. One year of wind speed and ambient measurements were used in conjunction with marine thermocline data to estimate the time series electricity and thermal energy yields. The total energy yield from the system was found to be significantly higher than that from a conventional offshore wind turbine generator (OWTG) that only produces electricity. It could be shown that at sites having less energetic wind behavior and high ambient temperatures as a result of a hotter climate, the cooling energy component that can be delivered from such a system is relatively high even at periods of low wind speeds.

TI  - Assessing the impact of multi-terminal HVDC grids for wind integration on future scenarios of a real-world AC power system using grid code compliant open models
AB  - The exploitation of multi-terminal (MT) HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) grids for offshore wind farm integration into continental bulk AC system raises several technical issues, in particular the verification of the compliance of MTDC grids and offshore wind parks to the performance requirements (in terms of frequency, voltage support and fault ride through) which are being established by the grid codes, and the availability of general and customizable models to simulate their response. The goal of this work is to provide a set of "open" general models, able to fulfill the grid code requirements if suitably tuned, enabling the TSOs to perform their analyses without relying exclusively on vendor-specific models. In order to verify the realistic response of these models, an example of MTDC grid is simulated, connecting it to several plausible operating scenarios of a real world AC system (the West Denmark grid) in target year 2020: after a preliminary N-1 static security assessment study on the integrated AC/DC system, some simulations are performed to check the fulfillment of grid code requirements in case of typical contingencies.

AB  - An economic assessment study was conducted in this paper on Moroccan onshore wind farms. The study is based on the levelized cost of energy (LCOE). The main parameters included in the LCOE calculus were extracted from wind turbine supervisory control and data analysis (SCADA). A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to analyze the influence of each parameter on the LCOE variation. Results assess the attractiveness of Moroccan onshore wind for future investments under certain conditions. These results were also discussed and compared with onshore and offshore power plants of some other countries. Â© 2017 IEEE.

TI  - Voltage control strategies for offshore wind power collection systems upon faults
AB  - Three types of offshore wind power collection topologies are studied for DC power systems in this paper. Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) based Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS) is considered and the Optimal Power Control (OPC) is used for the Maximum Power Point Track (MPPT) control. The failure of a wind power unit is regarded as the fault condition in this paper. Voltage control strategies are proposed for series and series-parallel power collection topologies when such a fault happens. Input and output voltage references of the Grid-Side Converter (GSC) are modified for series power collection systems on fault conditions. For series-parallel collection systems, power switches are employed between wind power branches and different voltage control effects with different switch options are discussed. Simulation studies are conducted base on PSCAD/EMTDC to validate the proposed control strategies. Â© 2016 IEEE.

TI  - An alternative to unattractive space stations?
AB  - The basis of the present proposals are wave and wind driven pumps delivering seawater into suitable reservoirs from which it flows into hydraulic stations. Two types of stations are being considered namely low head stations with 30' head and high head stations with say 150' head. In the latter case a low head reservoir (20') is supplied by wave and wind driven pumps whilst the high head reservoir is filled from the low head reservoir by wind driven pumps with a head of 130'. For all conditions supply piping friction losses are negligible as flow speeds are kept low. For the purpose of this paper an efficiency of 80% for the hydraulic stations has been assumed and the following sizes of pumps have been chosen: wave driven pumps providing 8 BHP of electric energy and wind driven pumps providing 18.5 and 30 BHP.

TI  - Wind turbine wake models developed at the technical university of Denmark: A review
AB  - Wind turbine wakes are one of the most important aspects in wind power meteorology because they decrease the power production and increase the loading of downstream wind turbines. Therefore, there is a continuous need to find a `good' wake model to properly plan wind power plant-level control strategies, predict the performance and understand the fatigue loads of turbines. In this paper, six widely used approaches of wake modelling (Jensen, Larsen, Dynamic Wake Meandering, Fuga and, Ellipsys3D LES and RANS together with their interpretations) that were developed at Technical University of Denmark, are described and the model subcomponents are analysed. The models are evaluated using data from the Sexbierum (onshore) and the Lillgrund (offshore) wind farms to understand how to best utilize them. The paper provides a comprehensive conceptual background to wake modelling combined with the overview of the state-of-the-art models including their implementations on operating wind farms.

TI  - Power generation optimization from sea waves by using a permanent magnet linear generator drive
AB  - This paper presents the design procedure and modeling methodology for a four sided linear permanent magnet generator used in sea wave energy extraction applications. Appropriate coupled magnetic-electric-mechanical models for the analysis of the linear permanent magnet (LPM) generator and the hydraulic system have been developed. The effects of permanent magnet configuration on the overall system performance have been investigated. The proposed models suitability has been checked through measurements in a 16 kW prototype power plant. Â© 2008 IEEE.

TI  - A study to assess solar energy potential striking existing urban rooftops in Honolulu, Hawaii
AB  - Hawaii pays the highest electricity rates in the nation. Honolulu, the fourteenth largest city in the country, has a residential rate approaching $0.15 kWh and the neighboring counties range between $0.18 - $0.33 kWh. Hawaii also has a greater reliance on fossil fuels than any other state in the county. Ninety-percent of the Hawaii's energy is generated using oil and coal. Due to Hawaii's remote location there is no possibility of extended grid connections to support interstate green power distribution. Even within the state, the counties are delineated as distinct island land-forms which reduces the viability for intrastate renewable power connections. The challenges presented by this dangerous environmental and economic dependence on fossil fuels are offset by the renewable energy opportunities that naturally exist in the state. Ocean thermal energy conversion, sea water cooling, geothermal and wind are energy opportunities that have not yet been effectively employed. In 1998 the US Department of Energy identified Hawaii as the state with the greatest viability for solar energy applications. A departure from this fossil fuel dependence will rely on the ability to identify and optimize solar energy as augmenting central grids, as well as micro-grids and on-site distributed generation opportunities. This paper will identify one research team's effort to develop new methods of assessing solar energy potential striking existing buildings using orthorecitified aerial images, GIS data bases and new calculations to evaluate the radiant energy that can be harvested from actual commercial, industrial and residential rooftops in Honolulu. The study was concentrated in an area of Honolulu, Hawaii known as Mapunapuna, located north east of the Honolulu International Airport. This urban area that comprises industrial as well as commercial and residential buildings was chosen for its diversity of rooftop vocabulary and close proximity to the airport where weather data has been historically recorded. Solar energy can be captured from existing urban structures. By utilizing the current building inventory as points of power generation it is possible to avoid expanding into undeveloped areas to create new power plants. This paper will describe a new method to assess solar energy potential in urban areas. This process has been titled the Helianthus Solar Energy Assessment method (HSEA) by the research team. The HSEA solar assessment method includes the use of aerial imagery, GIS software and field observations as well as solar assessment formulae and additional patent pending processes to identify solar energy striking the surfaces of existing buildings. This technique can also be utilized as a design tool to guide the orientation and solar integration of buildings. HSEA can provide information to decision makers who may be engaged in setting large-scale energy policy that includes solar options.

TI  - Laying the foundations of offshore wind
AB  - The development of offshore wind power has become a pressing modern energy issue and the UK is taking a major role, with a significant deployment of turbines in UK waters. Two rounds of UK deployment have resulted in about 1,800MW installed capacity. Round three is just beginning, with the first site in the Moray Firth, where a 1,500MW offshore wind power station is to be developed by Moray Offshore Renewables. This entered the planning phase in June of this year.
