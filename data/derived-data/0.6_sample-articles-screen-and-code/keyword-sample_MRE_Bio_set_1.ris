TI  - Super-insulate or use renewable technology? Life cycle cost, energy and global warming potential analysis of nearly zero energy buildings (NZEB) in a temperate oceanic climate
AB  - There are numerous strategies available to design and construct a low energy or nearly zero energy building (NZEB). However, the design strategy for a building depends on a high number of factors including location, climate, cost, available resources, etc. For instance, for countries like Ireland, which have a temperate oceanic climate, a key to achieving NZEB is a high thermal and air tightness performance of the building envelope, installing highly efficient space and water heating systems, and utilising renewable technologies for energy and heat generation. The challenge is to find the best combination of design strategies that would tackle the energy performance problems of a particular building. For example, is it better to design a super-insulated building with minimum heating requirements, or provide less insulation but install a large amount of renewable energy sources? This paper presents the outcomes of a number of case study buildings in Ireland, which focus on the life cycle cost and environmental analysis (using energy and global warming potential as indicators) of NZEBs using various heat sources, such as a gas boiler, biomass boiler, a domestic gas fired combined heat and power unit, heat pump and renewable technology. With the de-carbonisation and increased efficiency of the electricity grid, the low global warming potential (GWP) emissions of biomass fuels and the depletion of fossil fuels, future buildings should be (i) designed and constructed to be super-insulated with high air-tightness performance resulting in minimum heating requirements and (ii) operate with heating systems that have low impact on the natural environment, such as a biomass boiler or heat pump.

TI  - Improving the environmental performance of di diesel engine using environment support fuel
AB  - This research article mainly discusses the impact of emissions and fuel economy rules as well as the range of design options and technological advances, required to reduce emissions, improving engine efficiency, and developing fuel economy. Today's energy needs are meeting all the way through fossil fuel and natural gas. As an outcome the amount of natural fuels, such as coal or gas from the remains of living organisms, is on receding for many years. This research confirms the concept of coconut oil as a renewable and substitute fuel for marine engines. Since, a diesel engine has flexible uses including small power generation and transportation sectors. In this article principally the focus is on the performance and emission level even a biofuel used as an alternative for marine engine. Experimentation shows a variety of studies based on the performance of a low speed diesel engine use of variant blends of biofuel obtained with a mixing coconut oil and diesel. While using biofuel blends as a fuel in test engine, it was running in a fine manner. Various blends of biofuel (i.e. B25, B50, and B 75 etc.) have been used to keep away from difficult alteration of the engine. As the outset compares the engine performance for biodiesel blends it was accepted to conclude the most excellent feasible blend for various working condition. As concerns this research work diesel fuel-coconut oil blends performed in lower smoke density and oxides of nitrogen emissions. Finally, this research work shows a pollution free environment with the support of biofuel concentrations.

TI  - Power from marine sediment fuel cells: The influence of anode material
AB  - The effect of anode material on the performance of microbial fuel cells (MFC), which utilise oxidisable carbon compounds and other components present in sediments on ocean floors, estuaries and other similar environments is reported. The MFC anode materials were carbon sponge, carbon cloth, carbon fibre, and reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC). Power was produced through the microbial activity at the anode in conjunction with, principally, oxygen reduction at a graphite cloth cathode. After a period of stabilisation, open circuit voltages up to 700 mV were observed for most cells. Steady state polarisations gave maximum power densities of 55 mW m-2 using carbon sponge as the anode; which was nearly twice that achieved with carbon cloth. The latter material typically gave power densities of around 20 mW m-2. The performance of the cell was reduced by operation at a low temperature of 5 Â°C. Generally, for cells which were capable of generating power at current densities of 100 mA m-2 and greater, mass transport was found to limit both the anode and the cathode performance, due primarily to the low concentrations of electro-active species present or generated in cells.

TI  - Use of sodium bicarbonate to stimulate triacylglycerol accumulation in the chlorophyte Scenedesmus sp and the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum
AB  - There is potential for algal-derived biofuel to help alleviate part of the world's dependency on petroleum based fuels. However, research must still be done on strain selection, induction of triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation, and fundamental algal metabolic studies, along with large-scale culturing techniques, harvesting, and biofuel/biomass processing. Here, we have advanced the knowledge on Scenedesmus sp. strain WC-1 by monitoring growth, pH, and TAG accumulation on a 14:10 light-dark cycle with atmospheric air or 5\% CO2 in air (v/v) aeration. Under ambient aeration, there was a loss of pH-induced TAG accumulation, presumably due to TAG consumption during the lower culture pH observed during dark hours (pH 9.4). Under 5\% CO2 aeration, the growth rate nearly doubled from 0.78 to 1.53 d(-1), but the pH was circumneutral (pH 6.9) and TAG accumulation was minimal. Experiments were also performed with 5\% CO2 during the exponential growth phase, which was then switched to aeration with atmospheric air when nitrate was close to depletion. These tests were run with and without the addition of 50 mM sodium bicarbonate. Cultures without added bicarbonate showed decreased growth rates with the aeration change, but there was no immediate TAG accumulation. The cultures with bicarbonate added immediately ceased cellular replication and rapid TAG accumulation was observed, as monitored by Nile Red fluorescence which has previously been correlated by gas chromatography to cellular TAG levels. Sodium bicarbonate addition (25 mM final concentration) was also tested with the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum strain Pt-1 and this organism also accumulated TAG.

TI  - Stark effects from global warming
AB  - Carbon dioxide emissions are causing oceans to warm, ocean chemistry to changeand rainfall patterns to shift. Some biosystems, such as coral reefs, may be approaching the threshold for damage and if global temperatures rise more than1.5 degrees centigrade over todays level tropical reefs may be irreversibly destroyed. Summer meltwater from glacial regions such as Greenland could disrupt ocean circulation and its transport of heat. Scientists warn that energy will have to be derived from sources other than fossil fuels to decarbonize the economy and prevent further increases in global warming.

TI  - Microbial fuel cell energy from an ocean cold seep
AB  - Benthic microbial fuel cells are devices that generate modest levels of electrical power in seafloor environments by a mechanism analogous to the coupled biogeochemical reactions that transfer electrons from organic carbon through redox intermediates to oxygen. Two benthic microbial fuel cells were deployed at a deep-ocean cold seep within Monterey Canyon, California, and were monitored for 125 days. Their anodes consisted of single graphite rods that were placed within microbial mat patches of the seep, while the cathodes consisted of carbon-fibre/titanium wire brushes attached to graphite plates suspended similar to 0.5 m above the sediment. Power records demonstrated a maximal sustained power density of 34 mW.m(-2) of anode surface area, equating to 1100 mW m(-2) of seafloor. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of microbial biofilms that formed on the electrode surfaces revealed changes in microbial community composition along the anode as a function of sediment depth and surrounding geochemistry. Near the sediment surface (20-29 cm depth), the anodic biofilm was dominated by microorganisms closely related to Desulfuromonas acetoxidans. At horizons 46-55 and 70-76 cm below the sediment-water interface, clone libraries showed more diverse populations, with increasing representation of delta-proteobacteria such as Desulfocapsa and Syntrophus, as well as epsilon-proteobacteria. Genes from phylotypes related to Pseudomonas dominated the cathode clone library. These results confound ascribing a single electron transport role performed by only a few members of the microbial community to explain energy harvesting from marine sediments. In addition, the microbial fuel cells exhibited slowly decreasing current attributable to a combination of anode passivation and sulfide mass transport limitation. Electron micrographs of fuel cell anodes and laboratory experiments confirmed that sulfide oxidation products can build up on anode surfaces and impede electron transfer. Thus, while cold seeps have the potential to provide more power than neighbouring ocean sediments, the limits of mass transport as well as the proclivity for passivation must be considered when developing new benthic microbial fuel cell designs to meet specific power requirements.

TI  - Prototype experiments of the low voltage mineral deposition technology as eco-friendly solution for improving the sustainability of offshore platforms at the end of their production life
AB  - Several oil and gas offshore platforms are approaching the end of their production life, thus requiring sounding sustainable management solutions. This study aimed to improve the current knowledge on the low voltage mineral deposition technology as an eco-friendly strategy to protect offshore platforms from corrosion and to create suitable substrates for the colonization and growth of sessile marine organisms, thus minimizing environmental impact due to metal release, supporting biodiversity and increasing ecological sustainability. To do so, experimental prototype structures were installed in the Ligurian Sea (NW Mediterranean Sea) with the aim to simulate the sub-merged parts of offshore platforms and to analyze over time (up to ca. 6 months), elemental and chemical composition, growth rates and corrosion protection ability of the minerals deposited on steel substrates, through the alkalization induced by cathodic polarization of the metal. The influence of operational (applied current density) and natural environmental parameters on the deposition process was investigated. Results of this experiment revealed that in general the mineral deposits were mainly composed by aragonite (CaCO3) and brucite (Mg(OH)2) and, more specifically, the amount of the latter prevails a little bit on the amount of the former. This result is most likely related to high cathodic polarization current densities reached during the experimentation. Despite brucite is expected to worsen the physical-mechanical characteristics of the mineral deposits, the overall deposits were able to protect to a certain extent the electrified steel material from corrosion. After about 6 months of induced mineral deposition, the layer over the steel reached the maximum thickness of about 2.4 mm, following a nonlinear trend as a function of time, whereas the deposition rates ranged from 20.0 to 50.3 mu m d-1, in relation with the applied current densities. At the same time, a positive relationship of the deposit grow rates with seawater temperature has been observed. Overall, the outcomes reported in this study provide new elements for the application of low voltage mineral deposition technology in temperate seas and pave the way for defining the best operating conditions to protect steel structures from corrosion and support biodiversity, thus contributing to the sustainability of the natural capital.

TI  - Photosynthetic carbon uptake induces autoflocculation of the marine microalga Nannochloropsis oculata
AB  - Microalgal biomass has been used to produce biofuels, aquaculture feed, high-value chemicals such as pigments and antioxidants, and even human food. This study addresses one of the key bottlenecks to the commercialisation of microalgal bioproducts: the high energy and environmental cost of harvesting microalgal cells out of suspension. An innovative and sustainable autoflocculation procedure was developed to pre-concentrate microalgal biomass for easier harvesting. Microalgal cell agglomeration by autoflocculation at high pH was induced for the first time, without the addition of a chemical flocculant, in the commercially-relevant microalga Nannochloropsis oculata. Photosynthetic inorganic carbon uptake, in the absence of carbon dioxide supply by mass transfer, was used to raise the culture pH. Autoflocculation started at pH 9.5 and reached a maximum flocculation efficiency of 90\% at pH 10.4. Microalgal surface charge-neutralisation by calcium cations, and sweep flocculation by calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate precipitates were identified as the dominant flocculation mechanisms. This was also the first study to measure changes in bacterial community composition under autoflocculation. There was a clear shift from free-living bacteria in suspension to attached bacteria during autoflocculation, with Flavobacteriales becoming the dominant order of bacteria. This highlights the influential role of attached bacteria and bacteria-produced extracellular polymeric substances in microalgal flocculation. This study shows that regulating carbon dioxide supply is a promising green alternative to traditional microalgal flocculation processes as it alleviates the requirement for costly and harmful chemical flocculants and brings us closer to sustainable microalgal bioproducts.

TI  - Achieving Blue Growth through maritime spatial planning: Offshore wind energy optimization and biodiversity conservation in Spain
AB  - Spain has a high potential for renewable energy production, being the world's third country by installed on-shore wind power. However, it has not yet fully developed its renewable energy production capacity, with no commercial offshore wind production to date, and remains highly dependent on fossil fuel imports. The country is also one of Europe's most biodiverse, on land and at sea. This study spatially assesses the country's offshore wind energy potential by incorporating the newly designated marine protected areas (MPAs) to the official Spanish strategic environmental assessment for the installation of offshore windfarms (SEA). It also identifies optimal areas for offshore windfarm development according to key physical variables such as wind speed, depth and substrate type. It finally assesses real commercial windfarm projects against current environmental constraints. The results show that nearly 50% of the whole area within 24Â nm from the Spanish coast could be suitable for offshore windfarm development at the planning phase. However, only 0.7% of that area is optimal for wind energy production with current fixed turbine technology. Nevertheless, either area would allow Spain to meet its national targets of 750Â MW of ocean power capacity installed by 2020 under adequate local wind conditions. Over 88% of all commercial windfarm project area is within the SEA's Exclusion zone, thus unfeasible under current circumstances. Technological breakthroughs like floating turbines may soon make the optimal windfarm area (OWA) less restrictive and reduce current environmental impacts of marine windfarms within a truly sustainable Blue Growth.

TI  - Recent developments on biofuels production from microalgae and macroalgae
AB  - Biofuels from algae are considered as promising alternatives of conventional fossil fuels, as they can eliminate most of the environmental problems. The present study focuses on all the possible avenues of biofuels production through biochemical and thermochemical conversion methods in one place, bringing together both microalgae and macroalgae on the same platform. It provides a brief overview on the mechanism of different biofuel production from algae. Factors affecting the biofuel process and the associated challenges have been highlighted alongwith analysis of techno-economic study available in literature. Undoubtly, biodiesel is the center of attraction among other biofuels. However, their routes and process need to be optimized in order to bring the minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of biodiesel competitive. Technological challenges have not been overcome to make biofuel production process energetically and commercially viable. Macroalgae are low in lipid content. Therefore, the use of macro algae is restricted for gaseous fuels or fermentative methods of liquid biofuels production. Anaerobic digestion of algal biomass is easy and seems promising as the process is simple in terms of engineering and infrastructure requirement. Hydrogen production by microalgae through biophotolysis seems interesting as it directly converts the solar energy into hydrogen. However, the process has not been scaled-up till today. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is more promising due to handling of wet biomass at moderate temperature and pressure and conversion of whole biomass into high quality oil. However, HTL process is energy intensive. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Interactive effect of temperature, pH and light intensity on biodesalination of seawater by synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 and on the cyanobacteria growth
AB  - Desalination allows to pipe viable water supply from ocean, the largest water resource, as potable water for drink and daily usage. The technology such as thermal distillation and membrane separation technology requires intense energy source. Almost all desalination plants using fossil fuel as their primary energy source, which leads to many challenges. Marine-euryhaline Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002, on the other hand, is one of the potential cyanobacteria that may contribute to the development and advancement in water treatment field. These cyanobacteria are able to generate a huge amount of biomass and producing fresh water (low-salt saline water). Thus, this leads the study to investigate the influence of process parameters on biodesalination by Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 associate to growth rate of the cyanobacteria. The results showed that temperature, light intensity and pH play important role in sodium reduction. More than 50% of salinity reduction was obtained at optimum condition. Interactive effects between selected factors concluded that higher salinity removal was observed at temperature of 36Â°C with the pH of 10 and light intensity of 3500 lux. However, the growth is contrast to biodesalination. Interaction effect between temperature-pH, suggested that the growth prefer near neutral condition regardless of the temperature. When temperature interacts with light intensity, inverse relation of these two factors resulted of higher growth rates. Further study is required to understand biodesalination by Synechococcus sp. and its growth. Nevertheless, the study has shown that biodesalination by Synechococcus sp. has the potential in biodesallination process and integration with current technology for potable water source can be further investigated.

TI  - Seaweed biomass of the Philippines: Sustainable feedstock for biogas production
AB  - Archipelagic and island countries are among the most affected by the worsening climate change. To mitigate global warming, the Philippines mandated the use of biofuel through the Biofuel Act of 2006. However, coping with the increasing biomass demand for biofuel production is challenging because of the country's limited freshwater and land resources. On the other hand, the Philippines has rich but untapped marine biomass resources. Hence, the potential of seaweed resources as the most accessible energy source for coastal and island communities of the Philippines was explored for methane fermentation. The seaweed species, Sargassum spp., Turbinaria spp., Hydroclathrus spp., Caulerpa spp., and Ulva spp., which can allow sustainable biomass supply either through managed harvesting of natural stocks or through cultivation, have been identified. Information on the geographical distribution and seasonal productivity of these species were laid out. The proximate and elemental components of the biomass were presented for viability assessment as feedstock. Challenges on biogas technology in the Philippines and anaerobic digestion of seaweed biomass were also evaluated. Research on the development of culture technologies for the Sargassum spp., Turbinaria spp., Hydroclathrus spp, and Ulva spp. is recommended to avoid the adverse impacts of harvesting on natural stocks. Further studies on anaerobic digestion conditions of the selected seaweeds that are suitable for utilization by island communities should also be conducted. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Leading edges in bioremediation technologies for removal of petroleum hydrocarbons
AB  - There is a worldwide concern regarding soil pollution caused by contamination of petroleum hydrocarbon, released during oil processing or production. Once a spill occurs, it disturbs the marine and freshwater ecosystem and greatly threatens human health. It usually requires complex technologies to remove it from soil. Petroleum hydrocarbons contain a range of chemicals which are extremely toxic and carcinogenic in nature. Although physical or chemical methods are widely employed for remediation, numerous studies revealed that bioremediation is a sustainable approach. Bioremediation is often preferred as clean and carbon-neutral solution. This review aims to provide series of sustainable solution for petroleum hydrocarbon degradation without exploiting the environment as well as opportunity to reuse treated media. Integrated and enhanced bioremediation technologies are more effective than natural degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in terms of shorter time period and percent removal efficiency. It comprehensively illustrates bioremediation assisted with bacteria, fungi, and algae either by integrated technologies or by enhancing the process. Most recent application methods of petroleum hydrocarbon bioremediation (in situ and ex situ) are also reported. There is dire need to explore different cost-effective biotechnological resources for degradation of petroleum hydrocarbon by the screening of novel microbial strains or by the creation of genetically engineered bacteria to survive in harsh environment.

TI  - Offshore wind energy: The next North sea oil
AB  - Offshore wind energy, which is considered to be the next North Sea oil, is one of the most significant renewable energy sources attracting increasing attention from researchers and the general public worldwide due to its potential to reduce carbon emissions and increase the security of the world's energy supply. An assessment of appropriate sites for an offshore wind energy system (OWES) in Australia is required to select the best sites for offshore wind farms in Australia. Three types of sub-structures are generally used for offshore wind energy systems, including torpid, gravity-based caissons, and monopiles, which reach up to 4.5 meters in diameter. One of the significant criterions for the selection of sites is wind speed, which is considered as the main resource for offshore wind energy. The biological and environmental aspects of the proposed site also should be investigated to avoid the devastating effects caused by minor disturbances to ecology.

TI  - A review of the use of organic Rankine cycle power systems for maritime applications
AB  - Diesel engines are by far the most common means of propulsion aboard ships. It is estimated that around half of their fuel energy consumption is dissipated as low-grade heat. The organic Rankine cycle technology is a well-established solution for the energy conversion of thermal power from biomass combustion, geothermal reservoirs, and waste heat from industrial processes. However, its economic feasibility has not yet been demonstrated for marine applications. This paper aims at evaluating the potential of using organic Rankine cycle systems for waste heat recovery aboard ships. The suitable vessels and engine heat sources are identified by estimating the total recoverable energy. Different cycle architectures, working fluids, components, and control strategies are analyzed. The economic feasibility and integration on board are also evaluated. A number of research and development areas are identified in order to tackle the challenges limiting a widespread use of this technology in currently operating vessels and new-buildings. The results indicate that organic Rankine cycle units recovering heat from the exhaust gases of engines using low-sulfur fuels could yield fuel savings between 10\% and 15\%.

TI  - Conceptual design and key technology development of a long-range underwater vehicle traveling over thousands kilometers
AB  - The underwater platform which has enough ability to cruise globally and freely in vast deep sea will allow us to make the survey of entire oceans. We aim to develop an underwater platform which travels and surveys across entire oceans for the research into the global change, ocean-trench earthquake, and biodiversity and so on. We have developed the first prototype underwater platform or the long-range cruising autonomous underwater vehicle (LCAUV) named Urashima since 1998. The vehicle powered by a polymer electrolyte fuel cell system marked the world record of cruising distance of 317 kilometers in 2005. The vehicle has the following specifications: length; 10 m, weight; 10 tons, maximum depth ratings; 3500 m, maximum cruising speed; 3.2 knots, and endurance; 60 hours. This large vehicle has large user payload of a few hundreds kilograms. In 2007, we started research and development of the elemental technologies which will be utilizes for development of the second generation LCAUV to achieve cruising range of over 3000 kilometers. The technologies under research and development are power sources, navigation methods, communication methods, vehicle controllers, materials for body, and advanced sensors for highly resolution survey. The fuel cell and secondary battery hybrid system is had to improve at energy efficiency to generate electricity as possible for long time running with limited energy. A high accuracy inertial navigation system and an underwater positioning system being covered area of over 1000 km are under development. A synthesized aperture sonar is also under development.

TI  - First-Time implementation of innovative in situ biotechnology on an offshore platform in arabian gulf for continuous water quality monitoring and early leak detection
AB  - We present first-Time ever implementation of an innovative biomonitoring technology (High-Frequency Non-Invasive Valvometry) on an offshore oil producing platform located in the Arabian Gulf (TOTAL Abu Al Bukhoosh - UAE). This technology is unique; it is a tool allowing continuous in situ monitoring of water quality and detection of hydrocarbons at extremely low levels. This constitutes a key step in responsible management to minimize environmental footprint through the development of an advanced technology for operational use. This technology, developed by CNRS and University of Bordeaux (France), previously tested in a Research & Development program by TOTAL in laboratory, artificial outdoor river streams, and coastal sites, uses bivalves equipped with micro-electrodes recording their opening and closing activity. The latter is interpreted in terms of natural behavior and reaction to stressors. For offshore implementation, a Technical Committee with contributors from all technical departments was established, in order to identify and resolve all operational constraints and issues. The emblematic local pearl oyster Pinctada radiata was selected, and an agreement with the Environment Agency Abu Dhabi enabled appropriate local species collection and preparation. Effective leadership and strong involvement and collaboration of all technical departments in Abu Dhabi and France were key component in achieving success. All technical issues were assessed: HSE, technological safety, logistics, construction, IT, maintenance, metocean data.... Pearl oysters were collected and equipped with electromagnets at the Al Mirfa oyster farm with the support of the Environment Agency of Abu Dhabi. The installation solution adopted consists of valvometers (with multiparameter water probes to measure water temperature, oxygen content, and chlorophyll a), positioned along a suspension cable under the platform and securely moored at seafloor and platform structure. This solution avoids the use of divers (hence reducing both costs and safety risks), and allows easy equipment removal if needed. Crane and 1.3T deadweight were used to install the equipment and ensure mooring. Installation of two valvometers and two water probes was successfully completed in April 2017, before seawater reached a high temperature, to avoid mortality of oysters when manipulated. Valvometers and water probes are installed close to the seabed (-26m water depth) and in the water column (-10m water depth). The system is planned to run until March 2018. Preliminary results are shown and demonstrate that this technology is operationally viable for in-situ continuous water quality monitoring in a real industrial context such as an offshore oil producing platform. Natural biological rhythms of pearl oysters Pinctata radiata are well reconstructed from HFNI Valvometry data (circadian and circatidal cycles), while changes in water quality can be observed from valvometry bar codes data logs and animals' growth rate indices. Yearround data acquisition and capture will data to be generated to give a detailed characterization of oysters' behavior for biomonitoring purpose. As a result, a step change in environmental monitoring solutions for O&G industry is expected to come from this new technology and approach. Â© 2017, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - Sustainable Production of Nannochloris atomus Biomass Towards Biodiesel Production
AB  - Nannochloris atomus (QUCCCM31) is a local marine microalga showing potential to serve as renewable feedstock for biodiesel production. The investigation of the impact of temperature variation and nitrogen concentrations on the biomass and lipid productivities evidenced that biomass productivity increased with the temperature to reach an optimum of 195 mgL(-1) d(-1) at 30 degrees C. Similarly, the lipid content was strongly influenced by the elevation of temperature; indeed, it increased up to similar to 3 folds when the temperature increased from 20 to 40 degrees C. When both stresses were combined, triacylglycerols and lipid productivity reached a maximum of 45\% and 88 mgL(-1) d(-1), respectively at 40 degrees C. Cultures under high temperatures along with Nitrogen-Depleted (ND) favored the synthesis of Fatty Acids Methyl Ester (FAMEs) suitable for high quality biodiesel production, whereas cultures conducted at low temperature coupled with Nitrogen-Limited (NL) led to a production of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Our results support the feasibility of cultivating the thermotolerant isolate QUCCCM31 year-round to meet the sustainability challenges of algal biomass production by growing under temperature and nitrogen variations. The presence of omega 3 and 9 fatty acids as valuable co-products will help in reducing the total process cost via biorefinery.

Both cells and their enzymes can be used for production of renewable energy. These mechanical cells acting like live cells were called biological fuel cells. They can produce electricity using wastewater, biodegredable organic material, and/or direct organic chemicals such as glucose.

AB  - Biocatalytic conversion of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide into commercial products is one of the promising key approaches to solve the problem of climate change. Microbial enzymes, including carbonic anhydrase, NAD-dependent formate dehydrogenase, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, and methane monooxygenase, have been exploited to convert atmospheric gases into industrial products. Carbonic anhydrases are Zn2+-dependent metalloenzymes that catalyze the reversible conversion of CO2 into bicarbonate. They are widespread in bacteria, algae, plants, and higher organisms. In higher organisms, they regulate the physiological pH and contribute to CO2 transport in the blood. In plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria carbonic anhydrases are involved in photosynthesis. Converting CO2 into bicarbonate by carbonic anhydrases can solidify gaseous CO2, thereby reducing global warming due to the burning of fossil fuels. This review discusses the three-dimensional structures of carbonic anhydrases, their physiological role in marine life, their catalytic mechanism, the types of inhibitors, and their medicine and industry applications.

TI  - Fungal-assisted algal flocculation: application in wastewater treatment and biofuel production
AB  - Background: The microalgal-based industries are facing a number of important challenges that in turn affect their economic viability. Arguably the most important of these are associated with the high costs of harvesting and dewatering of the microalgal cells, the costs and sustainability of nutrient supplies and costly methods for large scale oil extraction. Existing harvesting technologies, which can account for up to 50\% of the total cost, are not economically feasible because of either requiring too much energy or the addition of chemicals. Fungal-assisted flocculation is currently receiving increased attention because of its high harvesting efficiency. Moreover, some of fungal and microalgal strains are well known for their ability to treat wastewater, generating biomass which represents a renewable and sustainable feedstock for bioenergy production. Results: We screened 33 fungal strains, isolated from compost, straws and soil for their lipid content and flocculation efficiencies against representatives of microalgae commercially used for biodiesel production, namely the heterotrophic freshwater microalgae Chlorella protothecoides and the marine microalgae Tetraselmis suecica. Lipid levels and composition were analyzed in fungal-algal pellets grown on media containing alternative carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus sources from wheat straw and swine wastewater, respectively. The biomass of fungal-algal pellets grown on swine wastewater was used as feedstock for the production of value-added chemicals, biogas, bio-solids and liquid petrochemicals through pyrolysis. Co-cultivation of microalgae and filamentous fungus increased total biomass production, lipid yield and wastewater bioremediation efficiency. Conclusion: Fungal-assisted microalgal flocculation shows significant potential for solving the major challenges facing the commercialization of microalgal biotechnology, namely (i) the efficient and cost-effective harvesting of freshwater and seawater algal strains; (ii) enhancement of total oil production and optimization of its composition; (iii) nutrient supply through recovering of the primary nutrients, nitrogen and phosphates and microelements from wastewater. The biomass generated was thermochemically converted into biogas, bio-solids and a range of liquid petrochemicals including straight-chain C12 to C21 alkanes which can be directly used as a glycerine-free component of biodiesel. Pyrolysis represents an efficient alternative strategy for biofuel production from species with tough cell walls such as fungi and fungal-algal pellets.

TI  - Enabling bioeconomy with offshore macroalgae biorefineries
AB  - The bioeconomy provides a possible solution for the increasing demand on natural resources by substitution of the nonrenewable resources with resources derived from biomass, thus reducing the environmental impact of fossil fuels. A fundamental unit that will enable the bioeconomy implementation is biorefinery. The bioeconomy is a collective term for the complex system that includes biomass production, transportation, conversion into products, and product distribution. In this chapter, we introduce the concept of offshore marine biorefineries as potential drivers for the bioeconomy of the future. We discuss fundamental thermodynamics principles that determine the optimum scale of biorefineries and put the limit for the services area for a single-processing unit. We provide a review of the current methods to produce biomass offshore. Next, we exemplify the marine biorefineries, which show co-production of several products from the same biomass, thus reducing the waste and maximizing economic benefit from the unit. In addition, we discuss the economic and environmental challenges of marine biorefineries as an emerging platform for society transition to low-carbon economy.

TI  - Biodiesel and Renewable Diesel as a Drop-in Fuel for Decarbonized Maritime Transportation
AB  - Some of the biggest problems facing our world on a global scale are global warming, climate change, and air pollution. The transport and logistics sector causes these problems to become even more intractable with the internal combustion engines used, and the role of maritime transport in this regard is substantial. The International Maritime Organization (IMO), which is the United Nationsâ€™ (UN) specialized agency for regulating maritime transportation, began its studies on the topic of greenhouse gas within the scope of the UNâ€™s sustainable goals for the future and announced the initial greenhouse gas (GHG) strategy plan in April 2018. In these ongoing studies, the importance of alternative marine fuels becomes more and more critical day by day. There are many types of alternative marine fuels with different properties, such as liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas, methanol, ethanol, and biofuels. Each alternative fuel has its own characteristics, which leads to some advantages and disadvantages in terms of use. During the transition to alternative fuels from conventional fuels, drop-in fuels such as biodiesel and renewable diesel can be used to meet the reduction target of the IMO Initial GHG Strategy. The advantage of these biofuels is that it can be used with the existing fuel system and a diesel engine without any retrofit requirement or can be used with minor modifications. The purpose of this study is to state the steps that IMO has taken for decarbonization and then to explain the properties, raw materials, and production methods of biodiesel and renewable diesel, an alternative marine fuel, and to determine its usability and suitability by comparing it with other promising alternative fuels and revealing their pros and cons for decarbonizing the maritime industry.

TI  - Ferrites as an Alternative Source of Renewable Energy for Hydroelectric Cell
AB  - There are many conventional ways of producing energy at large scales such as fossil fuels, hydroelectric power station, wind energy, solar cell plants, marine energy, etc., but most of these require bulky plantation, huge manpower, wide land occupation and are non-portable and expensive to handle too. In the twenty-first century, there is still a huge gap between worldwide energy supply and its demand. The advances in the technology sector have also increased the consumption of energy, but the sources of generating the renewable energy remain limited. In order to account for these problems in recent years, several methods have been adopted and a significant research in this direction has been made by the invention of the hydroelectric cell by Dr. R. K. Kotnalaâ€™s group in 2016. Instead of using the magnetic character in the ferrite nanostructures, these nanomaterials were first time effectively exploited for direct energy harvesting application by using their capability to dissociate the absorbed water molecules on its porous surface. This allows the production of ions, which is then followed by the charge transfer of hydronium, hydroxyl and hydrogen ions between the electrodes of the ferrite nanostructures and results in the generation of an electric current across the circuit. The concept of the hydroelectric cell is new, and these cells are easily portable, inexpensive, biodegradable and eco-friendly in nature. This chapter provides an insight on the concept of spinel ferrite nanostructures for the application in the hydroelectric cell. Â© 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Attempt to mitigate marine engine emissions with improved performance by the investigation of alcohol inclusion in sunflower biodiesel-sunflower oil-diesel blend
AB  - The quaternary blends (diesel-biodiesel-vegetable oil-alcohol) offer enormous potential for reducing fossil fuel usage and mitigating air pollution caused by marine diesel engines. Biodiesel and alcohol are alternate fuels possessing high oxygen content, ensuring clean combustion. Vegetable oil is beneficial in saving diesel contribution and increasing engine lubrication. The objective of the present work was to reduce the dependency on conventional diesel and to come up with cleaner fuel that can also improve engine performance. This experimental work aims to lower exhaust emissions by fueling a single-cylinder, four-stroke direct-injection diesel engine with novel quaternary blends comprising diesel (50\%), sunflower biodiesel (25\%), sunflower oil (5\%), and alcohol (20\%). In order to develop cleaner fuel than diesel, different quaternary blends were prepared by varying the length of the carbon chain of alcohols in the blends, namely, DBOEth20, DBOProp20, DBOBut20, DBOHep20, and DBODec20. The performance emissions of quaternary blends were tested at varied engine loads from 5 to 20 Nm (full load), while engine speed was fixed at 1800 rpm. The results indicate that DBOProp20 resulted in the lowest fuel consumption and highest thermal efficiency. DBOProp20 reduced CO2, NOx, and smoke emissions by 19.6\%, 9.9\%, and 85.7\%, as compared to diesel. However, DBODec20 succeed in mitigating CO emission by 41.37\% at 100\% load. DBOBut20 proved to be most promising in reducing UHC emission by a maximum of 71.69\% at 100\% load. The highest BTE of 10.98\% with lowest BSFC of 13.04\% was recorded for DBOProp20 at 100\% engine load, in comparison to pure diesel.

TI  - Power Generation and Anode Bacterial Community Compositions of Sediment Fuel Cells Differing in Anode Materials and Carbon Sources
AB  - For monitoring environmental conditions of remote places, sustainable power generators are necessary to power telemetry sensor systems. A sediment microbial fuel cell (SMFC) is a device that produces electricity biologically from organic matters in sediment. Because a SMFC utilizes sediment organic materials and microbial catalysts in river or oceanic sediment, a SMFC can be a feasible solution for sustainable power generation in remote places. However, oligotrophic sediment conditions often limit energy source supply, resulting in insufficient power output for operating electronic devices. The objective of this study is to investigate power generation and anode bacterial communities of SMFCs with different anode materials and carbon sources for enhancement of power output and longevity of SMFCs. Four kinds of anode electrodes were tested in SMFCs; a magnesium electrode (M), a magnesium electrode supplied with chitin particles (M+C), a graphite electrode (G), and a graphite electrode supplied with chitin particles (G+C). Average maximum power density was highest in Mg+C (1878 +/- 982 mW m(-2)), followed by M (848 +/- 348 mW m(-2)), G+C (1.9 +/- 0.6 mW m(-2)) and G (0.7 +/- 0.6 mW m(-2)). Maximum power densities of the magnesium electrodes were similar to 1,000 times larger than those of the graphite electrodes. The chitin supplement increased maximum power densities by 121\% in the magnesium anodes and 164\% in the graphite anodes on average. A magnesium electrode in M+C degraded more slowly than that of M. Anode bacterial communities of the magnesium anodes were diverse than the graphite anodes, and the supplemented chitin greatly influenced anode bacterial community compositions. Although magnesium corrosion was a main process of power production in the magnesium-anode SMFCs, species-level anode bacterial communities were very different between M and M+C. Anode bacterial communities of the chitin-absent anodes had larger richness estimates and diversity estimates than those of the chitin-supplemented anodes, suggesting that the saturated carbon source greatly simplified anode bacterial communities.

TI  - Carbon dioxide capture and bioenergy production using biological system - A review
AB  - With the growing use of fossil fuels and industrial activity, the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission is continuously increasing and is considered a primary contributor to climate change. CO2 emissions from stationary resources (coal fire, cement plants, and other industry) can be reduced by using various carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies. In this article, recent advancements in various biological methods (i.e., carbonic anhydrase (CA), hydrogenation of CO2 to formate, reduction of CO2 to methane, CO2 conversion into methanol by enzyme cascade, and the role of RuBisCo enzyme) that have been reported for CO2 capture are discussed, along with their advantages and limitations. A brief overview of other physicochemical (absorption, adsorption, cryogenic, and membrane) technologies is also provided. Although biological methods are eco-friendly and can be performed under ambient conditions, these approaches are still not cost effective, as the reactions require cofactors, and the enzymes lose activity when exposed to hot flue gas and ionic liquids. Most captured CO2 is stored by mineralization using a geological and ocean storage method without providing any economic benefit. It is a question of interest as to how we can utilize CO2 and generate revenue. Utilization of CO2 as a feedstock to produce bioenergy is a possible approach. Various microbes capable of utilizing CO2 as feedstock and producing biofuels (biodiesel and bioalcohol) have been reported. These two technologies, i.e., CO2 capture and bioconversion of CO2 into bioenergy, can be integrated to develop a process that not only mitigates CO2 effects on the environment but also solves energy problems while generating revenue.

TI  - Sustainability on-orbit: Space solar power and cloud computing constellation two examples of international offset projects
AB  - Space-based solar power (SBSP) and Cloud Computing On-Orbit (CCO) are two examples of international offset projects underway at GEI applicable to sustainability. Others include UAV/satellite forest fire monitoring, international students/post-doc research, sustainable green construction, point-to-point sub-orbital flight, ocean monitoring, autonomous SoC development, and bio-fuels and other biotech projects. Offset projects can take advantage of resources made available during large international procurements. SBSP has been talked about many times since Peter Glaser's invention of the concept over 40 years ago, however there still has not been a single SBSP watt transmitted down from orbit. Students at San Jose State University have been researching the feasibility of a SBSP demonstration, using either the International Space Station or a small satellite in LEO. The research for the SBSP demonstration has also helped to develop the concept of on-orbit cloud computing, and both concepts can be utilized for lunar applications. The SBSP demonstration is important because the necessary efficiencies and losses have not yet been clearly established and is being developed to beam 200 watts of power to Earth's surface, estimating 25% efficiency due to atmospheric losses and laser conversion losses. All technology needed for the demonstration exists. The cost, schedule and other programmatic elements of this demonstration will be provided. International offset can be a source of funding for this demonstration. SBSP and on-orbit cloud computing are both important concepts involving sustainable energy, thereby contributing to world peace, because they both make use of the abundant, renewable energy source of the Sun.

TI  - Performance and applicability of new material Heat exchanger to substitute titanium
AB  - Heat exchanger takes important role in economic feasibility for Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) or Sea Water Air Conditioning (SWAC) systems. As the portion of heat exchanger made of titanium (Ti) with anti-corrosion function against seawater is more than 20âˆ¼30% of total initial cost, the economical feasibility can be enhanced by replacing titanium with cheaper corrosion-resistant materials or treatment methods. This study carry out to examine the corrosion-resistant property of Electrodeposited Oxy-Nitriding Steel (EONS) plate, it turns out life time of the EONS plate is more than 13.9 years. Also, the heat transfer performance for condensation and evaporation of the EONS plate heat exchanger were found to be 11.3% and 7% higher than those of Ti plate heat exchanger. If the life time of the EONS plate of 13.9 years compared to the Ti plate which could be assumed about 30 years, then practical application is possible whether its production cost is found to be less than 46.5% of Ti plate. Lower cost of mass-producing EONS plate by 45% than existing Ti plate seems to enable the substitution in OTEC and SWAC. Â© Copyright 2016 by ASME.

TI  - Micro-scale characterization of carbonate sands with nanoindentation
AB  - Many offshore energy production and recovery structures such as wind turbines, offshore tidal turbines, and oil/gas platforms are built on carbonate sands, which predominantly consist of the skeletal remains of marine organisms. Particles of carbonate sands have highly porous grain structures with intra-granular voids. Such porous grain structure results in a much more compressible soil grain than terrigenous (i.e., quartz-based) sands, which have solid grain structure. As a result, calcareous sands exhibit engineering and mechanical characteristics that are different than that of quartzitic sands. While there is a significant amount of experience on the performance of foundation systems on terrigenous sediments, expanding offshore infrastructure construction on carbonate sands brings considerable challenges. This study focuses on micro-scale characterization of carbonate sands as a first step to overcome this challenge. For this purpose, nanoindentation tests were performed on ten different carbonate sand samples. Mechanical properties of carbonate sand grains were determined using nanoindentation techniques. A series of peak loads are applied by the nanoindenter on the grain surface and load-displacement curves are developed to estimate Young's modulus and hardness values of the carbonate sand grains. Modulus and hardness of the carbonate sand grains were considerably lower than those reported for quartzitic sand grains. Test results cumulatively show that modulus and hardness values of carbonate sands are highly dependent on indentation depth. Considerable softening with increasing indentation depth was observed; both the modulus and hardness values of carbonate sand grains show a significant decrease at larger indentation depths. Furthermore, high inter-sample and inter-grain variation of mechanical properties was observed. This study on the micro-scale characterization of carbonate sands provides insight on their distinctive macro-scale behavior. Â© 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

TI  - Green Pathway of CO2 Capture
AB  - Global warming reaches an average of up to 425Â ppm in May 2020 with an increasing rate of CO2 emissions. The outcome is the melting of icebergs and seriously affected biodiversity. Therefore, demand was raised for the creation of new mitigation approaches to effectively catch it. Developing cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and productive CO2 capture technologies are required. In this chapter, we illustrated alternate green CO2 sequestration routes such as adsorption via, MOFs, green solvent absorption, and biological CO2 conversion method. Unlike biotic sequestration, abiotic sequestration is a method of engineering. It is possible to develop advanced technologies for deep injection into the ocean, geological structures, coal mines, and oil wells, etc. The detailed process and results are discussed in the given chapter.

TI  - Extending grassland age for climate change mitigation and adaptation on clay soils
AB  - Permanent grassland soils can act as a sink for carbon and may therefore positively contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. We compared young (5â€“15 years since latest grassland renewal) with old (&gt;20 years since latest grassland renewal) permanent grassland soils in terms of carbon stock, carbon sequestration, drought tolerance and flood resistance. The research was carried out on marine clay soil at 10 dairy farms with young and old permanent grassland. As hypothesized, the carbon stock was larger in old grassland (62 Mg C haâˆ’1) topsoil (0â€“10Â cm) than in young grassland topsoil (51 Mg C haâˆ’1). The carbon sequestration rate was greater in young (on average 3.0Â Mg C haâˆ’1Â yearâˆ’1) compared with old grassland (1.6Â Mg C haâˆ’1Â yearâˆ’1) and determined by initial carbon stock. Regarding potential drought tolerance, we found larger soil moisture and soil organic matter (SOM) contents in old compared with young grassland topsoils. As hypothesized, the old grassland soils were more resistant to heavy rainfall as measured by water infiltration rate and macroporosity (at 20 cm depth) in comparison with the young grassland soils. In contrast to our hypothesis we did not find a difference in rooting between young and old permanent grassland, probably due to large variability in root biomass and root tip density. We conclude that old grasslands at dairy farms on clay soil can contribute more to the ecosystem services climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation than young grasslands. This study shows that under real farm conditions on a clay topsoil, carbon stock increases with grassland age and even after 30 years carbon saturation has not been reached. Further study is warranted to determine by how much extending grassland age can contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Highlights: We studied the effect of young versus old grassland on a range of soil properties related to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Old, more than young, grassland soils offer potential to mitigate and adapt to climate change. This finding gives farmers insight into the merits of extending grassland age on clay soils. Soil carbon stock determines carbon sequestration rate more than grassland age. Â© 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Sustainable production of biofuels from the algae-derived biomass
AB  - The worldwide fossil fuel reserves are rapidly and continually being depleted as a result of the rapid increase in global population and rising energy sector needs. Fossil fuels should not be used carelessly since they produce greenhouse gases, air pollution, and global warming, which leads to ecological imbalance and health risks. The study aims to discuss the alternative renewable energy source that is necessary to meet the needs of the global energy industry in the future. Both microalgae and macroalgae have great potential for several industrial applications. Algae-based biofuels can surmount the inadequacies presented by conventional fuels, thereby reducing the `food versus fuel' debate. Cultivation of algae can be performed in all three systems; closed, open, and hybrid frameworks from which algal biomass is harvested, treated and converted into the desired biofuels. Among these, closed photobioreactors are considered the most efficient system for the cultivation of algae. Different types of closed systems can be employed for the cultivation of algae such as stirred tank photobioreactor, flat panel photobioreactor, vertical column photobioreactor, bubble column photobioreactor, and horizontal tubular photobioreactor. The type of cultivation system along with various factors, such as light, temperature, nutrients, carbon dioxide, and pH affect the yield of algal biomass and hence the biofuel production. Algae-based biofuels present numerous benefits in terms of economic growth. Developing a biofuel industry based on algal cultivation can provide us with a lot of socio-economic advantages contributing to a publicly maintainable result. This article outlines the third-generation biofuels, how they are cultivated in different systems, different influencing factors, and the technologies for the conversion of biomass. The benefits provided by these new generation biofuels are also discussed. The development of algae-based biofuel would not only change environmental pollution control but also benefit producers' economic and social advancement. [}GRAPHICS] .

TI  - Modeling and simulation of Tethered UnderSea Kites
AB  - In this work an emerging hydrokinetic energy technology, Tethered UnderSea Kites (TUSK), is studied. TUSK systems use an axial-flow turbine and generator mounted on a rigid, underwater winged kite that is tethered to a floating surface buoy to extract power from an ocean current. The tethered underwater kite is controlled to travel in cross-current motions at a high velocity which is at least four to five times larger than the ocean current velocity. This higher velocity significantly increases the potential power output compared to conventional fixed marine turbines. Modeling and simulation of the kitetether dynamics in a TUSK system is studied by developing and solving governing equations of motion derived from Euler-Lagrange equations. Models for physical effects appropriate to TUSK systems are developed, including for turbine power and turbine drag, kite wing hydrodynamic forces, and the effect of turbine blade tip cavitation on turbine power output. A baseline simulation that includes these modeled effects and a simple kite control scheme is studied to estimate cross-current kite trajectories, turbine power output, kite hydrodynamic forces, kite pitch, roll and yaw dynamics, and tether tensions. Once the baseline simulation case has been fully explored, a parametric study is conducted that varies key design and flow parameters including ocean current speed, kite weight and wing area, turbine rotor area, tether length, and kite control system parameters.

TI  - High-value materials from microalgae
AB  - Microalgae are a diverse group of photosynthetic organisms and abundant in every ecosystem in the biosphere. They are common in aqueous environments including marine, brackish and fresh waters and in some habitats that lack eukaryotic life such as some hot springs and highly alkaline lakes. Microalgal biotechnology that is focused on the microalgae-based production of a variety of useful materials such as pharmaceutical compounds, health foods, natural pigments, and biofuels is considered as an important discipline with the development of biotechnology. In addition, the mass cultivation of microalgae can also contribute to improving the environmental quality by reducing the concentration of CO2 which is one of major gases lead to global warming. Consequently, it seems that the microalgae can be used as an efficient, renewable, environmentally friendly source of high-value biomaterials such as chemicals, pigments, energy, etc. and the microalgal biotechnology will most likely represent a larger portion of modern biotechnology.

TI  - Outline of Ongoing Research Activities of the Marine Ecology Research Institute, Mainly Regarding Thermal Issues in Japan
AB  - The Marine Ecology Research Institute (MERI) was established in 1975 by an agreement among three government agencies, which were then known as the Fisheries Agency, Energy Agency, and Environmental Agency. MERI is the only research organization in Japan specialized in research to elucidate the effects of thermal power plant cooling systems on coastal fishery resources and marine organisms. Most fossil fuel and all nuclear power plants in Japan are located at the seaside and employ the once-through cooling system. The water pollution control law of Japan lists ``heat discharge{''} as one of its regulation targets. However, no law, regulation, or guideline for heat discharge has been enacted so far in Japan. Issues concerning the temperature rise of water between the intake and discharge at power plants and the structural design of intake and discharge facilities have been settled by an agreement between power companies and local governments under the guidance of national agencies, including the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. No serious damage to local fishery resources because of power plant operations has been reported so far. Recent public concern has focused on the impacts of these power plants on the marine environment and on preserving the ecosystem. Impacts of chemical substances including anti-biofouling substances, are also of concerned. With the possible global warming, thermal impacts on marine ecosystem have again become a public issue. In addition to the elucidation of power plant impacts on fishery resources, MERI has also given higher priority to the following: Technological development of impact assessment on the coastal ecosystem, including macrophyte beds, Application of intake and discharge facilities for new biotopes of marine organisms living around power plants, Exploitation of water currents created by cooling water intake and discharge for water quality improvement in and near harbor areas, Impact assessment of anti-biofouling substances Investigation of the effects of ocean temperature rises as well as ocean acidification and CO2 sequestration, MERI will deal with any coastal environment issues in cooperation with national agencies, the power industry, and the fishery industry.

TI  - Assessment of Multi-Use Offshore Platforms: Structure Classification and Design Challenges
AB  - As the world continues to experience problems including a lack of seafood and high energy demands, this paper provides an assessment for integrated multi-use offshore platforms (MUPs) as a step towards exploiting open seawater in a sustainable way to harvest food and energy. The paper begins with background about MUPs, including information regarding what an MUP is and why it is used. The potential energy technologies that can be involved in an offshore platform are introduced while addressing similar applications all over the world. The paper presents the state of the art of MUP structures on the light of EU-funded programs. An MUP would have a positive impact on various marine activities such as tourism, aquaculture, transport, oil and gas and leisure. However, there are concerns about the negative impact of MUPs on the marine environment and ecosystem. Building an MUP with 100\% renewable energy resources is still a challenge because a large storage capacity must be considered with a well-designed control system. However, marine bio-mass would play a vital role in reducing battery size and improving power supply reliability. Direct Current (DC) systems have never been considered for offshore platforms, but they could be a better alternative as a simpler control system that requires with lower costs, has lower distribution losses, and has an increased system efficiency, so studying the feasibility of using DC systems for MUPs is required.

TI  - The Impacts of Ocean Acidification on Marine Ecosystems and Reliant Human Communities
AB  - Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, from fossil fuel combustion and deforestation, along with agriculture and land-use practices are causing wholesale increases in seawater CO2 and inorganic carbon levels; reductions in pH; and alterations in acid-base chemistry of estuarine, coastal, and surface open-ocean waters. On the basis of laboratory experiments and field studies of naturally elevated CO2 marine environments, widespread biological impacts of human-driven ocean acidification have been posited, ranging from changes in organism physiology and population dynamics to altered communities and ecosystems. Acidification, in conjunction with other climate change-related environmental stresses, particularly under future climate change and further elevated atmospheric CO2 levels, potentially puts at risk many of the valuable ecosystem services that the ocean provides to society, such as fisheries, aquaculture, and shoreline protection. This review emphasizes both current scientific understanding and knowledge gaps, highlighting directions for future research and recognizing the information needs of policymakers and stakeholders.

This study investigates the influence of biodiesel blend on the characteristics of residual and distillate marine fuels. Adequate correlation equations are applied to calculate the fuel properties of the blended marine fuels with biodiesel. Residual marine fuel RMA has inferior fuel characteristics compared with distillate marine fuel DMA and biodiesel. The flash point of marine fuel RMA could be increased by 20% if blended with 20 vol% biodiesel. The sulfur content of residual marine fuel could meet the requirement of the 2008 MARPOL Annex VI Amendment by blending it with 23.0 vol% biodiesel. In addition, the kinematic viscosity of residual marine fuel could be reduced by 12.9% and the carbon residue by 23.6% if 20 vol% and 25 vol% biodiesel are used, respectively. Residual marine fuel blended with 20 vol% biodiesel decreases its lower heating value by 1.9%. Moreover, the fuel properties of residual marine fuel are found to improve more significantly with biodiesel blending than those of distillate marine fuel. Â© 2013 by the authors.

TI  - Combustion iron distribution and deposition
AB  - Iron is hypothesized to be an important micronutrient for ocean biota, thus modulating carbon dioxide uptake by the ocean biological pump. Studies have assumed that atmospheric deposition of iron to the open ocean is predominantly from mineral aerosols. For the first time we model the source, transport, and deposition of iron from combustion sources. Iron is produced in small quantities during fossil fuel burning, incinerator use, and biomass burning. The sources of combustion iron are concentrated in the industrialized regions and biomass burning regions, largely in the tropics. Model results suggest that combustion iron can represent up to 50% of the total iron deposited, but over open ocean regions it is usually less than 5% of the total iron, with the highest values (<30%) close to the East Asian continent in the North Pacific. For ocean biogeochemistry the bioavailability of the iron is important, and this is often estimated by the fraction which is soluble (Fe(II)). Previous studies have argued that atmospheric processing of the relatively insoluble Fe(III) occurs to make it more soluble (Fe(II)). Modeled estimates of soluble iron amounts based solely on atmospheric processing as simulated here cannot match the variability in daily averaged in situ concentration measurements in Korea, which is located close to both combustion and dust sources. The best match to the observations is that there are substantial direct emissions of soluble iron from combustion processes. If we assume observed soluble Fe/black carbon ratios in Korea are representative of the whole globe, we obtain the result that deposition of soluble iron from combustion contributes 20-100% of the soluble iron deposition over many ocean regions. This implies that more work should be done refining the emissions and deposition of combustion sources of soluble iron globally. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.

TI  - A review on regulations, current status, effects and reduction strategies of emissions for marine diesel engines
AB  - Marine diesel engines, which provide main power source for ships, mainly contribute to air pollution in ports and coastal areas. Thus there is an increasing demand on tightening the emission standards for marine diesel engines, which necessitates the research on various emission reduction strategies. This review covers emission regulations and emission factors (EFs), environmental effects and available emission reduction solutions for marine diesel engines. Not only the establishment of the emission control areas (ECAs) in the regulations but also many experiments show high concerns about the sulfur limits in fuels, sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. Research results reveal that NOx emissions from marine diesel engines account for 50% of total NOx in harbors and coastal regions. Sulfur content in fuel oil is an important parameter index that determines the development direction of emission control technologies. Despites some issues, biodiesel, methanol and liquefied nature gas (LNG) play their important roles in reducing emissions as well as in replacing fossil energy, being promising fuels for marine diesel engines. Fuel-water emulsion (FWE) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) are effective treatment option for NOx emissions control. Common rail fuel injection is an effective fuel injection strategy to achieve simultaneous reductions in particulate matter (PM) and NOx. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and wet scrubbing are the most mature and effective exhaust aftertreatment methods for marine diesel engines, which show 90% De-NOx efficiency and 95% De-SOx efficiency. It can be concluded that the integrated multi-pollutant treatment for ship emissions holds great promise. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Isolation of promising bacterial strains from soil and marine environment for polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) production utilizing Jatropha biodiesel byproduct
AB  - PHAs are biodegradable and environmentally friendly thermoplastics. The major contributor to PHA production cost is carbon substrate cost, therefore it is desirable to produce PHA from waste/byproducts like Jatropha biodiesel byproducts. This study was done using Jatropha biodiesel byproduct as carbon source, to decrease production cost for PHAs. Total 41 isolates from soil and marine source were able to utilize Jatropha biodiesel byproduct. Nine bacteria were selected for further studies, which were found positive for Nile red viable colony screening. Two bacterial isolates SM-P-1S and SM-P-3M isolated from soil and marine environment respectively, were found promising for PHA production. PHA accumulation for SM-P-1S and SM-P-3M was 71.8\% and 75\% PHA/CDW respectively and identified as Bacillus sonorensis and Halomonas hydrothermalis by MTCC. The PHA obtained from SM-P-1S and SM-P-3M was analyzed by FTIR and NMR as polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The value of carbon sequestration and storage in coastal habitats areas in North West of Morocco
AB  - Morocco, like the rest of the world, is experiencing a climate change that threatens a number of wetlands. Marine ecosystems contribute to the regulation of the Earth's climate, but their degradation releases large quantities of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. This paper aimed to map and model changes in carbon storage and sequestration for coastal habitats using the INVEST model, using the Sidi Moussa-Oualidia lagoon complex as a case study. To achieve this objective, several data were used, namely, land use and land cover maps between 2003 and 2020, as well as data on the amount of carbon stored in the three basins; biomass, sediment carbon (soil) and dead carbon (litter), and the annual rate of carbon accumulation in biomass and sediment. The results obtained in this work allowed us to compare the two former and current carbon stock and net sequestration scenarios and to evaluate the social cost of carbon in the study area. This study can facilitate the development of a coastal rehabilitation strategy to take advantage of the benefits of these wetlands and, at the same time, to conserve the ecosystem services provided by these environments, including the CBCS.

TI  - Risk Assessment of Offshore Micro Integrated Energy System Based on Fluid Mosaic Model
AB  - Offshore micro integrated energy systems are the basis of offshore oil and gas engineering. In order to evaluate its operational risks and ensure the safe development of marine resources, a risk assessment scheme for offshore micro integrated energy systems based on a risk fluid mosaic model is proposed. Aiming at the current situation that the traditional equipment material-energy conversion model has a large amount of modeling and does not fully reflect the system structure, a material-energy conversion model based on unified modeling is constructed, and a risk function is introduced to analyze the material-energy of the power equipment under risk conversion; At the same time, a risk fluid mosaic model based on the system structure and material-energy carrier is constructed to describe the dynamic behavior of risk from the material-energy flow; Aiming at the fact that the traditional risk grading model cannot reflect the overall risk of the system when multiple risks are involved, a multi-weighted system risk grading model is proposed to describe the overall risk situation of the system under multiple risks. The validity and rationality of the model and method proposed in this paper is verified by using an offshore oil and gas platform in the Bohai Sea as a simulation example. Â© 2013 IEEE.

TI  - Environmental and Economic Impacts of Biofouling on Marine and Coastal Heat Exchangers
AB  - Biofouling is a major problem that affects the heat transfer efficiency of marine and coastal heat exchangers. The reduced heat exchanger efficiency results in energy loss and thereby affects the overall energy efficiency in the marine industry segment. Additional energy is required to compensate for the energy loss leading to increased fuel consumption which in turn contributes to global environmental issues like climate change. The current industrial methods of biofouling mitigation or removal from heat exchanger surfaces increase both operational and maintenance expenditure causing further environmental damages. This paper presents two models to provide an overview of the major environmental and economic impacts due to biofouling in marine heat exchangers. The study results suggest the need for sustainable biofouling prevention techniques to improve the energy and resource efficiency of marine heat exchangers.

TI  - Are algae ready to take off? GHG emission savings of algae-to-kerosene production
AB  - Aviation alternative fuels are perceived as an effective short-term mean to decarbonise our flights. Sustainable aviation fuels from algae have been recently approved for commercial flights, and here we present an assessment of their greenhouse gas (GHG) savings. Three case studies have been investigated with different plant designs and cultivation strategies. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation's Life Cycle Assessment methodology is used as a guideline to assess the GHG saving potential of aviation fuels from algae. The approach here presented allows having a sound comparison with other alternative fuel production pathways. We show that the cultivation strategy based on oil maximisation does not necessarily provide significant advantages in terms of GHG savings. The assessed GHG savings fall in a wide range, being dependent on the inputs and cultivation strategy considered. In the best-case scenario, up to 68% of GHG savings can be achieved, therefore offering a substantial advantage over traditional fuels. When compared with the GHG saving of kerosene from other traditional bio-based feedstocks, like rapeseed, the results confirm algae as an interesting alternative, provided that certain conditions for their cultivation, such as high process optimisation, nutrient recycling and use of renewable energy to meet input demand, are met. The study also assessed the area potentially needed for an algae production plant able to supply large volumes of raw material to an existing commercial biorefinery. The findings confirm the potential of this feedstock to mitigate land abandonment on the coasts of the Mediterranean basin. Â© 2021 The Author(s)

TI  - Microbial sludge formation in Brazilian marine diesel oil (B0) and soybean methylic biodiesel blends (B10 and B20) during simulated storage
AB  - Biofuels are renewable alternatives to fossil fuels mainly due to the lower impact they have in terms of release of air pollutants. Brazilian diesel oil must be composed of 10-15\% biodiesel, while the addition of biodiesel to marine diesel oil has not yet been authorized. This paper aimed to evaluate the impact of the addition of biodiesel to marine diesel oil. The biotic and abiotic degradation of pure (B0) marine diesel oil and that with the addition of 10\% (B10) and 20\% (B20) of soybean methyl biodiesel were evaluated in simulated storage in an aqueous phase of Bushnell Haas mineral medium for 28 days. An uncharacterized inoculum (adapted from the ASTM E1259-16 standard) was prepared from a microbial population found in the marine diesel oil storage tank of a ship. For 28 days, microbial growth was monitored by gravimetry and the composition of the fungal microbial community was determined by next-generation sequencing (NGS). In the aqueous phase of the tests, the nature of the metabolites (pH measurements, headspace-solid phase microextraction {[}HS-SPME], gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), detection of the lipase enzyme (Rhodamine B Medium) and production of biosurfactants (surface tension measurements) were assessed. The oil phase was evaluated by gas chromatog-raphy (GC) and infrared spectroscopy. Higher biomass was observed in the B20 condition and the microbial community analysis revealed the dominance of the genus Pseudallescheria. No significant pH decreases were observed in the aqueous phase; however, the analyses by HS-SPME and GC-MS showed the presence of organic acids, alkanes, and phenols in both conditions, with and without microorganisms. The infrared results with the mixtures (10 and 20\%) showed degradation of the biodiesel fraction. GC analysis showed that the linoleic acid methyl ester was the most susceptible to degradation by microorganisms. Thus, the results found showed the impact of adding biodiesel to marine diesel, calling attention to the need for maintenance routines, which will guarantee the final quality of the stored fuel.

TI  - Optimization of Sink Locations in Carbon Integration Networks
AB  - The detrimental environmental impacts of climate change that are a result of high atmospheric CO2 concentrations have prompted global efforts to limit the continuous increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Many are now relying on the deployment of various carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) methods which have been found reliable for reducing CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Various industries are shifting towards the decarbonisation of their operations through the use of a combination of various CCUS activities. This could involve the conversion of CO2 into value-added chemicals, the utilization of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), the injection of CO2 into geological formations and/or oceans, the biological fixation of CO2, and other similar activities. Such operations are often referred to as CO2 â€œsinksâ€. It is often crucial for industries to identify which CCUS operations to deploy, especially when faced with many choices, since factors such as the cost of implementation and the sink efficiency play a significant role in the sink selection process. In this work, a mathematical model that helps identify optimal CO2 sink locations within industrial clusters is developed and utilized. Identifying optimal sink locations is an important factor that needs to be considered as part of a CCUS network planning problem. The proposed mathematical model was found to be very useful for identifying optimal CCUS sink selections, and their respective locations. A total of 22.7% of savings in transportation costs have been realized within the network, when compared to the case of having sink locations prescribed upfront. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Performance and exhaust emissions of diesel engines using microalgae FAME and the prospects for microalgae HTL biocrude
AB  - Microalgae's potential as a third generation biofuel has attracted recent attention. Two key methods for obtaining biofuel from microalgae are compared and contrasted, namely solvent extraction followed by transesterification, producing Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME) biodiesel, and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) to producing biocrude. The resulting differences in physicochemical characteristics affect engine performance and emissions as well as engine selection. Most microalgae engine research has been conducted on high speed diesel engines to investigate the performance and exhaust emissions of FAME whereas the HTL literature has mostly presumed biocrude would be upgraded for similar engines. However, growing awareness of the significant contribution of shipping emissions to public health brings into focus alternatives to heavy fuel oil (HFO) for low speed diesel (marine) engines. Such engines are thermodynamically very similar to high speed diesel engines but have the economic advantage that they can use low cost, high density fuels such as HFO/HTL. Microalgae FAME contains 10.5-11\% (wt) oxygen and 36.2-39.2 MJ/kg calorific value, (10-15\% lower than for petroleum diesel). High speed diesel engines tests using microalgae FAME generally decrease particulate emissions with a small penalty in engine power owing to the high oxygen content and lower Higher Heating Value (HHV). Conversely, biocrude obtained by HTL from green freshwater microalgae contained 10-11\% (wt) oxygen, 4-8\% (wt) nitrogen and 32-35 MJ/kg calorific value (20-27\% lower than for petroleum diesel). HTL biocrude would be expected to reduce emissions for low speed marine diesel engines compared to HFO, especially soot emissions due to their very low sulphur content, although NOx emissions may increase. HTL biocrude may reduce the engine performance (output power) compared to HFO due to the higher oxygen content and lower HHV. This review' aim is to compare microalgae FAME and HTL biocrude and their suitability for diesel engines regarding engine performance and emissions.

TI  - Carbon cycling in the world's mangrove ecosystems revisited: Significance of non-steady state diagenesis and subsurface linkages between the forest floor and the coastal ocean
AB  - Carbon cycling within the deep mangrove forest floor is unique compared to other marine ecosystems with organic carbon input, mineralization, burial, and advective and groundwater export pathways being in non-steady-state, often oscillating in synchrony with tides, plant uptake, and release/uptake via roots and other edaphic factors in a highly dynamic and harsh environment. Rates of soil organic carbon (CORG) mineralization and belowground CORG stocks are high, with rapid diagenesis throughout the deep (&gt;1 m) soil horizon. Pocketed with cracks, fissures, extensive roots, burrows, tubes, and drainage channels through which tidal waters percolate and drain, the forest floor sustains non-steady-state diagenesis of the soil CORG, in which decomposition processes at the soil surface are distinct from those in deeper soils. Aerobic respiration occurs within the upper 2 mm of the soil surface and within biogenic structures. On average, carbon respiration across the surface soil-air/water interface (104 mmol C m-2 d-1) equates to only 25% of the total carbon mineralized within the entire soil horizon, as nearly all respired carbon (569 mmol C m-2 d-1) is released in a dissolved form via advective porewater exchange and/or lateral transport and subsurface tidal pumping to adjacent tidal waters. A carbon budget for the world's mangrove ecosystems indicates that subsurface respiration is the second-largest respiratory flux after canopy respiration. Dissolved carbon release is sufficient to oversaturate water-column pCO2, causing tropical coastal waters to be a source of CO2 to the atmosphere. Mangrove dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) discharge contributes nearly 60% of DIC and 27% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) discharge from the world's low latitude rivers to the tropical coastal ocean. Mangroves inhabit only 0.3% of the global coastal ocean area but contribute 55% of air-sea exchange, 14% of CORG burial, 28% of DIC export, and 13% of DOC + particulate organic matter (POC) export from the world's coastal wetlands and estuaries to the atmosphere and global coastal ocean.

TI  - CO-HYDROPROCESSING-A ROUTE TO SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL
AB  - Aviation represents a unique and critical part of the global transportation system, carrying 1.8 billion passengers in 2020 to link the countries of the world across oceans and continents. The industry is built upon scientific understanding, with attention to detail for aircraft/engine design and fuel selection to deliver high levels of reliability, efficiency and performance. With environmental focus now on transport CO2 emissions, the industry have sought to apply these principles to meet a new challenge, to achieve[1] â€¢ Carbon neutral growth from 2021 â€¢ Net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 Numerous options are being progressed to meet these goals, including engine/aircraft design, flight profile optimisation, carbon management[2] and fuel technology. The focus of the present paper is on fuel technology, where the industry have approved a number of aviation kerosenes derived from alternative sources to mitigate CO2 emissions. Technology options include stand-alone manufacture or utilization of existing refinery units for co-processing[4,5]. Studies suggest the latter may reduce capital expenditure requirement by $0.33/gallon[6], a significant benefit to meet targets of 2% and 5% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production by 2025 and 2030 respectively. Currently co-processing of sustainable feedstocks is limited to 5% v/v in mixture with crude oil derived distillates. In this paper, the impact on aviation turbine fuel quality is examined through pilot plant studies where this limit has been increased to 30% v/v for bio-oils and Fisher Tropsch wax, both independently and in mixture.

TI  - Marine Ancillary Diesel Engine Emissions Reduction Using Advanced Fuels
AB  - Large transoceanic ships use marine ancillary diesel engines for generating electricity, which, on the other hand, produce a remarkable amount of harmful emissions during the combustion process. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) establishes standards that limit the amount of harmful emissions produced during the engine combustion cycle in maritime transport. Because of this restriction, new alternative fuels entered the market. Experiments had been performed with various testing fuels created from biodiesel and ULSD-F (Ultra Low Sulphur Diesel-Fuel) in the ratios of 0\%, 50\%, 80\%, and 100\%. During the tests, the engine ran at different speeds and loads so that the mixed fuel influence on engine operation could be observed in detail and investigated.

TI  - Constraints to commercialization of algal fuels
AB  - Production of algal crude oil has been achieved in various pilot scale facilities, but whether algal fuels can be produced in sufficient quantity to meaningfully displace petroleum fuels, has been largely overlooked. Limitations to commercialization of algal fuels need to be understood and addressed for any future commercialization. This review identifies the major constraints to commercialization of transport fuels from microalgae. Algae derived fuels are expensive compared to petroleum derived fuels, but this could change. Unfortunately, improved economics of production are not sufficient for an environmentally sustainable production, or its large scale feasibility. A low-cost point supply of concentrated carbon dioxide colocated with the other essential resources is necessary for producing algal fuels. An insufficiency of concentrated carbon dioxide is actually a major impediment to any substantial production of algal fuels. Sustainability of production requires the development of an ability to almost fully recycle the phosphorous and nitrogen nutrients that are necessary for algae culture. Development of a nitrogen biofixation ability to support production of algal fuels ought to be an important long term objective. At sufficiently large scale, a limited supply of freshwater will pose a significant limitation to production even if marine algae are used. Processes for recovering energy from the algal biomass left after the extraction of oil, are required for achieving a net positive energy balance in the algal fuel oil. The near term outlook for widespread use of algal fuels appears bleak, but fuels for niche applications such as in aviation may be likely in the medium term. Genetic and metabolic engineering of microalgae to boost production of fuel oil and ease its recovery, are essential for commercialization of algal fuels. Algae will need to be genetically modified for improved photosynthetic efficiency in the long term. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Monitoring of offshore geological carbon storage integrity: Implications of natural variability in the marine system and the assessment of anomaly detection criteria
AB  - The design of efficient monitoring programmes required for the assurance of offshore geological storage requires an understanding of the variability and heterogeneity of marine carbonate chemistry. In the absence of sufficient observational data and for extrapolation both spatially and seasonally, models have a significant role to play. In this study a previously evaluated hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model is used to characterise carbonate chemistry, in particular pH heterogeneity in the vicinity of the sea floor. Using three contrasting regions, the seasonal and short term variability are analysed and criteria that could be considered as indicators of anomalous carbonate chemistry identified. These criteria are then tested by imposing a number of randomised DIC perturbations on the model data, representing a comprehensive range of leakage scenarios. In conclusion optimal criteria and general rules for developing monitoring strategies are identified. Detection criteria will be site specific and vary seasonally and monitoring may be more efficient at periods of low dynamics. Analysis suggests that by using high frequency, sub-hourly monitoring anomalies as small as 0.01 of a pH unit or less may be successfully discriminated from natural variability â€“ thereby allowing detection of small leaks or at distance from a leakage source. Conversely assurance of no leakage would be profound. Detection at deeper sites is likely to be more efficient than at shallow sites where the near bed system is closely coupled to surface processes. Although this study is based on North Sea target sites for geological storage, the model and the general conclusions are relevant to the majority of offshore storage sites lying on the continental shelf.

TI  - Analysis of Underwater Noise Characteristics of Yangjiang Offshore Wind Farm during Construction
AB  - Renewable wind energy has become an advantageous alternative. By the end of 2020, the total global offshore wind energy capacity has exceeded 35GW, growing more than 106% in the 5 past years, and the capacity has exceeded 6GW. It is estimated that by 2025, the global installed capacity of offshore wind energy will reach 100GW. In 2020, China's new offshore wind energy installed capacity exceeded 3GW, accounting for 50.45% of the world's new installed capacity and became the second-largest offshore wind energy market in the world. Offshore wind energy projects will produce noise pollution with different characteristics during the construction and operation stages, which will cause temporary or permanent damage to marine life to some extent. In this paper, the on-site survey of the underwater noise during the construction period of the second section of the Shapa offshore wind farm in Yangjiang, Guangdong. The survey was conducted on two days, and the measurements were carried out at different distances outside the wind farm. Time-domain waveform analysis and frequency spectrum analysis were performed on the data. The research in this paper can provide technical reference for environmental impact assessment of offshore wind energy projects, and has great application value. Through the analysis of the underwater noise characteristics of the offshore wind farm at different distances, the following results are obtained: Firstly, as the distance increases, the measured sound pressure values far away from the wind farm site are slightly smaller than those at the edge of the wind farm. Due to the multi-path effect, the duration of the acoustic pulse signal measured at the edge of the wind farm is shorter than that outside the wind farm. The noise power of piling at the edge of the wind farm tends to be stable, which has little impact on the apogee. Secondly, the sound pulse of piling causes the underwater noise sound pressure level at the edge of the wind farm to be generally higher than that at the site far away from the wind farm. With the distance increasing, the frequency of the sound pressure peak will be shifted. The noise intensity has the largest change in the frequency range of 0~1000Hz, and it has little impact when the frequency range is over 1000Hz. The underwater noise at the edge of the wind farm is greater than the underwater noise far away from the wind farm by a relatively constant value. Thirdly, as the distance from the wind farm increases, the frequency spectrum within the frequency range of 150Hz to 250Hz changes significantly. Fourthly, the wind farm has little impact on the nearby underwater acoustic environment during the construction period, and the impact range is small, which is not enough to damage the hearing of creatures near the wind farm. However, whether the noise has a long-term impact on the physiology and behavior of nearby marine organisms remains to be verified by further experimental studies. Â© 2021 IEEE.

TI  - Neoteric solvent-based blue biorefinery: for chemicals, functional materials and fuels from oceanic biomass
AB  - Blue biorefineries integrate the production of renewable chemicals, fuels, functional materials and marketable commodities utilising biomass of marine origin. The global climate issues, ever-increasing population and depletion of fossil resources make the development of a bioeconomy based on sustainable resources a priority. Green technologies are emerging as a potential aid for developing eco-friendly processes to treat biomass for their conversion into value-added marketable products. New types of solvent systems such as ionic liquids (ILs), deep eutectic solvents (DESs), super critical CO2 (SC-CO2) and biomass-derived solvents are gaining attention for the efficient bioprocessing of natural resources. Due to their distinguished properties, they are promising solvent systems for blue biorefineries. This review summarizes the concept of blue biorefineries, the valuable resources available from the ocean, the marketable commodities developed using marine biomass and the potential of neoteric solvent systems for blue biorefineries.

The accumulation of residues along the shore, however, creates a littering hardship for the territory due to their bad rotting smell and introduces an obstacle to the enjoyment of the beaches and tourist swimming. Posidonia oceanica residues may be valorized producing bioenergy by anaerobic digestion. Due to its high lignin content, however, a pretreatment step is required for enhance energy recovery. In the present study the effects of acid addition in the thermal hydrolysis step were evaluated in terms of energy balance, biogas production and solids reduction. The results obtained have shown that when thermal pretreatment was enhanced by adding hydrochloric acid (0.4% w/w), an improvement in methane production of 575% was obtained compared to thermal pretreatment only with specific biogas production as high as 0.241 Â± 0.065 Nm3 per kgVS of wet Posidonia or 0.138 Â± 0.056 Nm3 CH4/kgVS. This result was ascribed to the defibration of lignocellulosic components operated by acidic thermal pretreatment which allowed the removal of 74%, 70% and 24% of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, respectively, during anaerobic digestion. The energy analysis carried out for treatment plants with capacity of 10 and 50 m3/d has shown that acid addition in the thermal hydrolysis step allows the energy balance to turn from extremely negative (energy demand is 8 to 10 times greater than the one produced) to positive values, with process energy efficiencies ranging from 22 to 35% with regards to the size of the plant.

TI  - Unlocking the black-box of inorganic carbon-uptake and utilization strategies among coral endosymbionts (Symbiodiniaceae)
AB  - Dinoflagellates within the family Symbiodiniaceae are widespread and fuel metabolism of reef-forming corals through photosynthesis. Adaptation in capacity to harvest and utilize light, and â€œsafelyâ€ process photosynthetically generated energy is a key factor regulating their broad ecological success. However, whether such adaptive capacity similarly extends to how Symbiodiniaceae species and genotypes assimilate inorganic carbon (Ci) remains unexplored. We build on recent approaches exploring functional diversity of fitness traits to identify whether Ci uptake and incorporation could be reconciled with evolutionary adaptation among Symbiodiniaceae. We examined phylogenetically diverse Symbiodiniaceae cultures (23 isolates, 6 genera) to track how carbon was invested into cellular uptake, excretion, and growth (cell size, division, storage). Gross carbon uptake rates (GPC) over 1 h varied among isolates grown at 26Â°C (0.63â€“3.08 pg C [cell h]âˆ’1) with no evident pattern with algal phylogeny. Intriguingly, net carbon uptake rates (24 h) were often higher (1.01â€“5.54 pg C [cell h]âˆ’1) than corresponding values of GPCâ€”we discuss how such GPC measurements may reflect highly conserved biological characteristics for cultured cells linked to high metabolic dependency on photorespiration and heterotrophy. Three isolates from different genera (Cladocopium goreaui, Durusdinium trenchii, and Effrenium voratum) were additionally grown at 20Â°C and 30Â°C. Here, Ci uptake consistently decreased with temperature-driven declines in growth rate, suggesting environmental regulation outweighs phylogenetic organization of carbon assimilation capacity among Symbiodiniaceae. Together, these data demonstrate environmental regulation and ecological success among Symbiodiniaceae likely rests on plasticity of upstream photosynthetic processes (light harvesting, energy quenching, etc.) to overcome evolutionary-conserved limitations in Ci functioning.

TI  - Roles and opportunities for microbial anaerobic oxidation of methane in natural and engineered systems
AB  - Reduction in methane emissions to the Earth's atmosphere is a critical strategy for tackling climate change. It is well established that anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) associated with sulfate reduction functions as an important methane sink in marine sediments. However, recent findings show that AOM uses diverse electron acceptors across a range of habitats, prompting examination of the potential role of AOM in mitigation of methane emissions and global climate change in non-marine environments. Methane is also a valuable energy source, widely used for production of electricity. Recent studies suggest that AOM could be used to produce liquid fuels/chemicals. The potential involvement of CO2 in product formation is particularly exciting as methane bioconversion could act as a net sink of CO2. The discovery that AOM is able to transfer electrons to solid electron acceptors suggests that methane may be a suitable source of electrons for a bioelectrochemical, biosynthesis cell. In addition, AOM has been used for pollution control and environmental remediation, such as nitrogen removal from contaminated water. Herein, we review and discuss implications of the latest scientific discoveries in AOM for methane emissions from aquatic and terrestrial environments, and methane as a feedstock for various biotechnology platforms.

TI  - Study on Multiobjective Modeling and Optimization of Offshore Micro Integrated Energy System considering Uncertainty of Load and Wind Power
AB  - Offshore micro integrated energy systems (OMIESs) are the basis of offshore oil and gas engineering and play an important role in developing and utilizing marine resources. By introducing offshore wind power generation, the carbon emissions of offshore micro integrated energy systems can be effectively reduced; however, greater challenges have been posted to the reliable operation due to the uncertainty. To reduce the influence brought by the uncertainty, a multiobjective optimization model was proposed based on the chance-constrained programming (CCP); the operating cost and penalty cost of natural gas emission were selected as objectives. Then, the improved hybrid constraints handling strategy based on nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (IHCHS-NSGAII) was introduced to solve the model efficiently. Finally, the numerical studies verified the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, as well as the validity and feasibility of the proposed model in improving the economy of OMIES under uncertainty.

TI  - Review of Studies on Joint Recovery of Macroalgae and Marine Debris by Hydrothermal Liquefaction
AB  - At the moment, macroalgae blooms in sea waters, the rotting of which causes greenhouse gas emissions and contributes to the formation of a negative ecological and economic situation in coastal zones, which has become a serious problem. Fuel production through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of macroalgae and marine debris is a promising solution to this ecological problem. The article provides an overview of studies on producing fuel from macroalgae and an assessment of the possibility of their joint recovery with marine debris. The optimal process conditions and their technological efficiency were evaluated. The article shows the feasibility of using heterogeneous catalysis and co-solvent to increase the yield of bio-oil and improve its quality. An assessment of the possibility of joint processing of waste macroalgae and marine debris showed the inexpediency of this direction. The high degree of drift macroalgae contamination also raises the question of the appropriateness of the preliminary extraction of other valuable components for nutrition use, such as fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and their derivatives.

TI  - AIR/OXY BIOMASS COMBUSTION WITH CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE
AB  - This work focuses on the carbon reduction potential from an oxy combustion system. The oxy fuel combustion of biomass and coal co-firing in a power plant in different ratios is studied using the Aspen plus modelling. The carbon and energy balance of various co-firing ratios is obtained. The influences of energy efficiency are also examined for each configuration. The global warming potential results show that the net CO2 emissions reduces as biomass co-firing ratio increases, however the net energy efficiency decreases. The CO2 from biomass is not included in the calculation as it is sequestered from the atmosphere during forest growth. On the other hand, other environmental impact such as Marine Eco Toxicity, Human Toxicity potential and fresh water toxicity potential increase with higher biomass ratios due to associated agricultural practices.

TI  - Gaseous and Particulate Emissions Using Isobutanol-Extended Fuel in Recreational Marine Two-Stroke and Four-Stroke Engines
AB  - Biologically derived isobutanol, a four carbon alcohol, has an energy density closer to that of gasoline and has potential to increase biofuel quantities beyond the current ethanol blend wall. When blended at 16 vol% (iB16), it has identical energy and oxygen content of 10 vol% ethanol (E10). Engine dynamometer emissions tests were conducted on two open-loop electronic fuel-injected marine outboard engines of both two-stroke and four-stroke designs using indolene certification fuel (non-oxygenated), iB16 and E10 fuels. Total particulate emissions were quantified using Sohxlet extraction to determine the amount of elemental and organic carbon. Data indicates a reduction in overall total particulate matter relative to indolene certification fuel with similar trends between iB16 and E10. Gaseous and PM emissions suggest that iB16, relative to E10, could be promising for increasing the use of renewable fuels in recreational marine engines and fuel systems.

TI  - Global carbon sequestration in tidal, saline wetland soils
AB  - [}1] Wetlands represent the largest component of the terrestrial biological carbon pool and thus play an important role in global carbon cycles. Most global carbon budgets, however, have focused on dry land ecosystems that extend over large areas and have not accounted for the many small, scattered carbon-storing ecosystems such as tidal saline wetlands. We compiled data for 154 sites in mangroves and salt marshes from the western and eastern Atlantic and Pacific coasts, as well as the Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Ocean, and Gulf of Mexico. The set of sites spans a latitudinal range from 22.4degreesS in the Indian Ocean to 55.5degrees N in the northeastern Atlantic. The average soil carbon density of mangrove swamps (0.055 +/- 0.004 g cm(-3)) is significantly higher than the salt marsh average (0.039 +/- 0.003 g cm(-3)). Soil carbon density in mangrove swamps and Spartina patens marshes declines with increasing average annual temperature, probably due to increased decay rates at higher temperatures. In contrast, carbon sequestration rates were not significantly different between mangrove swamps and salt marshes. Variability in sediment accumulation rates within marshes is a major control of carbon sequestration rates masking any relationship with climatic parameters. Globally, these combined wetlands store at least 44.6 Tg C yr(-1) and probably more, as detailed areal inventories are not available for salt marshes in China and South America. Much attention has been given to the role of freshwater wetlands, particularly northern peatlands, as carbon sinks. In contrast to peatlands, salt marshes and mangroves release negligible amounts of greenhouse gases and store more carbon per unit area.

TI  - Microalgae as second generation biofuel. A review
AB  - Microalgae are autotrophic microorganisms having extremely high photosynthetic efficiency and are valued as rich source of lipids, hydrocarbons, and other complex oils for biodiesel besides being an invaluable source of bioethanol, biomethane, and biohydrogen. Biodiesel produced from oilseed crops such as jatropha and soy have lower yields per unit land area and threaten food security. Indeed, microalgae have higher oil yields amounting to about 40 times more oil per unit area of land in comparison to terrestrial oilseed crops such as soy and canola. Further, microalgae production does not require arable land for cultivation. Biofuel is regarded as a proven clean energy source and several entrepreneurs are attempting to commercialize this renewable source. Technology for producing and using biofuel has been known for several years and is frequently modified and upgraded. In view of this, a review is presented on microalgae as second generation biofuel. Microalgal farming for biomass production is the biggest challenge and opportunity for the biofuel industry. These are considered to be more efficient in converting solar energy into chemical energy and are amongst the most efficient photosynthetic plants on earth. Microalgae have simple cellular structure, a lipid-rich composition, and a rapid rate of reproduction. Many microalgal strains can be grown in saltwater and other harsh conditions. Some autotrophic microalgae can also be converted to heterotrophic ones to accumulate high quality oils using organic carbon. However, there are several technical challenges that need to be addressed to make microalgal biofuel profitable. The efficiency of microalgal biomass production is highly influenced by environmental conditions, e.g., light of proper intensity and wavelength, temperature, CO2 concentration, nutrient composition, salinities and mixing conditions, and by the choice of cultivation systems: open versus closed pond systems, photobioreactors. Currently, microalgae for commercial purpose are grown mostly in open circular/elongated ``raceway{''} ponds which generally have low yields and high production costs. However, a hybrid system combining closed photobioreactor and open pond is a better option. The biggest hurdle in commercialization of microalgal biofuel is the high cost and energy requirement for the microalgal biomass production, particularly agitation, harvesting, and drying of biomass. In order to conserve energy and reduce costs, algae are often harvested in a two-step process involving flocculation followed by centrifugation, filtration, or micro-straining to get a solid concentration. However, the major bottlenecks in algal biodiesel production within the cell can be identified and handled by adopting a system approach involving transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. Research and developments in the field of new materials and advanced designs for cultivation in closed bioreactors, use of waste water for biomass production, screening of efficient strains, high-value coproduct strategy, and cutting-edge metabolic engineering are thought to provide the biggest opportunities to substantially improve the cost effectiveness of such production systems.

TI  - Feed additives as a strategic approach to reduce enteric methane production in cattle: modes of action, effectiveness and safety
AB  - Increasing consumer concern in greenhouse-gas (GHG) contributions from cattle is pushing the livestock industry to continue to improve their sustainability goals. As populations increase, particularly in low-income countries, the demand for animal-sourced foods will place further pressure to reduce emission intensity. Enteric methane (CH4) production contributes to most of the GHG from livestock; therefore, it is key to mitigating such emissions. Feed additives have primarily been used to increase animal productivity, but advances in understanding the rumen has resulted in their development to mitigate CH4 emissions. The present study reviewed some of the main feed additives with a potential to reduce enteric CH4 emissions, focusing on in vivo studies. Feed additives work by either inhibiting methanogenesis or modifying the rumen environment, such that CH4 production (g/day) is reduced. Feed additives that inhibit methanogenesis or compete with substrate for methanogens include 3-nitroxypropanol (3NOP), nitrates, and halogenated compounds containing organisms such as macroalgae. Although 3NOP and macroalgae affect methyl-coenzyme M reductase enzyme that is necessary in CH4 biosynthesis, the former is more specific to methanogens. In contrast, nitrates reduce CH4 emissions by competing with methanogens for hydrogen. However, nitrite could accumulate in blood and be toxic to ruminants. Rumen modifiers do not act directly on methanogens but rather on the conditions that promote methanogenesis. These feed additives include lipids, plant secondary compounds and essential oils. The efficacy of lipids has been studied extensively, and although supplementation with medium-chain and polyunsaturated fatty acids has shown substantial reduction in enteric CH4 production, the results have been variable. Similarly, secondary plant compounds and essential oils have shown inconsistent results, ranging from substantial reduction to modest increase in enteric CH4 emissions. Due to continued interest in this area, research is expected to accelerate in developing feed additives that can provide options in mitigating enteric CH4 emissions.

TI  - Assessment of offshore wave energy resources in taiwan using long-term dynamically downscaled winds from a third-generation reanalysis product
AB  - In this study, long-term wind fields during 1991â€“2010 from the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) were dynamically downscaled over Taiwan and its offshore islands at a 5 km horizontal resolution using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Simulations of the 10 m (above sea level) dynamically downscaled winds served as the atmospheric forcing for driving a fully coupled wave-circulation model. The sea states of the waters surrounding Taiwan during 1991â€“2010 were hindcasted to evaluate the offshore wave energy resources and optimal wave energy hotspots. This study reveals that the southeastern offshore waters of Taiwan and the Central Taiwan Strait exhibited the highest mean wave power density (WPD), exceeding 20 kW/m. The annual mean WPD, incidence of the hourly WPD greater than or equal to 4 kW/m, monthly variability index and coefficient of variation of the WPD indicated that the sea areas located between Green Island and Orchid Island (OH_1), southeast of Orchid Island (OH_2), south of the Hengchun Peninsula (OH_3), and north of the Penghu Islands (OH_4) were the optimal hotspots for deploying wave energy converters. The most energetic months were October for OH_1 and OH_2 and November for OH_3 and OH_4, while the wave power was weak from March to June for OH_1, OH_2 and OH_3 and in May for OH_4. The wave direction is prevailingly east-northeast for OH_1, OH_2 and OH_3 and nearly northeast for OH_4. These phenomena reveal that wave power in the waters offshore Taiwan is induced primarily by the northeast (winter) monsoon. The exploitable annual WPD was estimated to be 158.06, 182.89, 196.39 and 101.33 MWh/m for OH_1, OH_2, OH_3 and OH_4, respectively. Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Land based temperate species mariculture in warm tropical Hawaii
AB  - The Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority (NELHA) is the only location in the world today where large volumes of warm, surface seawater and cold, deep seawater are distributed onshore for the development of mariculture enterprises of temperate species in a tropical environment. Due to the insight of the State of Hawaii, a seacoast test facility was created in 1976 to provide land and resources to support the research and development needs of the advancement of the Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) process. In 1981, a twelve inch (0.3m) diameter deep seawater pipeline was successfully deployed offshore of the NELHA facility at Keahole Point. It was soon realized that the cold seawater was a valuable commodity worthy of exploitation. Not long thereafter it was determined that by blending appropriate mixtures of warn and cold seawater together a wide range of marine environments could be created. NELHA also receives the highest level of solar insolation compared to any coastal location in the United States. In order to utilize the potential benefits of these natural resources, NELHA modified its legislative charter in 1985 to allow it to develop commercial enterprises on its property. Over the past 26 years NELHA has become one of the most unique facilities for the development of land based mariculture. Today, 75% of Hawaii's aqua cultured seafood products are grown at the facility. The range of products cultured at the site includes abalone, edible sea vegetables, shrimp, oysters, clams, fish, spirulina, astaxanthin, biofuels from microalga, and others. Land based mariculture of this type requires innovative techniques and cutting edge technology. Although there are many advantages to growing seafood products on land and in a winterless climate, there are also challenges; not the least of which is higher operating costs. Quite often, culturing the feed for the target species to be marketed is more challenging than growing the main product itself. Due to the higher operating costs, the species cultured must often be marketed at a higher price and to a more affluent consumer. The sale of these niche products can also be significantly influenced by the health of the economies where it is marketed. In order to overcome the challenges of the development of these types of mariculture innovations, the NELHA tenants have had to develop new culturing processes and procedures to assure that their operations will be economically viable and profitable.

TI  - Studies of Recent Changes in Atmospheric O2 Content
AB  - A very close coupling exists between changes in atmospheric O2 and CO2 concentrations, owing to the chemistry of photosynthesis, respiration, and combustion. The coupling is not perfect, however, because CO2 variations are partially buffered by reactions involving the inorganic carbon system in seawater, which has no effect on O2. Measurements over the past two decades document variations in O2 on a range of space and time scales, including a long-term decrease driven mostly by fossil fuel burning and seasonal cycles driven by exchanges with the land biosphere and the oceans. In this chapter, these and other features seen in the measurements are described, also discussing variations in the tracer 'atmospheric potential oxygen,' which is a linear combination of O2 and CO2 designed to be insensitive to exchanges from the land biosphere and thereby sensitive mostly to oceanic processes. Challenges associated with measuring variations in O2 are addressed, and various applications of the observations are discussed, including quantifying the magnitude of the global land and ocean carbon sinks and testing ocean biogeochemical models. An updated budget for global carbon sinks based on O2 measurements from the Scripps O2 program is presented for the decades of the 1990s and 2000s. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - IEA: Global power demand to surge 2.2% annually through 2035
AB  - According to the International Energy Agency's (IEA) World Energy Outlook, electricity generation has entered a key period of transition - with investment shifting to low-carbon technologies - and world electricity demand set to grow faster than any other final form of energy. Under the central scenario in the report - the New Policies Scenario - world power demand will shoot up 2.2%/yr between 2008 and 2035, from 16,189 Tw-hr to âˆ¼ 30,300 Tw-hr. More than 80% of that growth will come from developing countries - led by China and followed by India - spurred by economic activity, industrial production, population, and urbanization. According to the IEA, China overtook the US in 2009 as the world's largest energy user. The country's energy demand is foreseen to surge 75% between 2008 and 2035, when it will account for 22% of world demand. China will lead the surge in electricity generation growth, and power demand in the country is expected to triple between 2008 and 2035. Globally, natural gas use will grow in absolute terms, continuing to fuel 21% of world electricity generation through 2035. Growth in natural gas will far surpass the growth in other fossil fuels' use due to its more favorable and practical attributes, and constraints on how quickly low-carbon energy technologies can be deployed. Renewable energy use, i.e., hydro, wind, solar, geothermal, modern biomass, and marine energy, is expected to increase - tripling through 2035. Demand for energy produced from renewables, e.g., wind, solar, geothermal, marine, modern biomass, and hydro, is expected to increase from 7% to 14%.

TI  - Evaluating the resilience benefits of marine energy in microgrids
AB  - Marine energy resources could promote clean energy and resilience of coastal and island microgrids, and thus, these applications are a key future market for marine energy development. To demonstrate these benefits, this paper illustrates how inclusion of wave resources into energy resilience solutions can improve overall grid efficiency and sustainability, as well as maintain electricity supply during grid outages. The paper describes a case study evaluation of the potential to add wave energy to the Molokaâ€™i grid as Hawaii strives to meet a 100% clean energy target. The Microgrid Component Optimization for Resilience tool is used to simulate operation in off-grid conditions and size different combinations of wave, solar photovoltaic (PV), wind, storage, and fuel resources required to meet resilience objectives. This research in-vestigates how including wave resources in a microgrid contributes to reducing or eliminating biofuel generation, producing a zero-greenhouse gas emission profile in the latter case, and avoiding the over-sizing of PV and battery systems to accommodate periods of unavailability or high demand. Insight from this paper supports the value proposition of wave resources for future markets and informs the relationship between marine generators and microgrids or isolated grids.

While these are often prefaced with an admission that physical processes are more important, the listener or reader comes away with a feeling that somehow biology has a very important role to play. This supposed importance is being used as a defense for the funding of a wide range of biologically oriented ocean programs. I challenge this defense.

TI  - Future of renewable energy in Bangladesh as a potential solution to energy crisis
AB  - The growth in economic sector of any country is directly dependent on the energy generation of that country. Being a developing country, the demand for electricity in Bangladesh is increasing day by day with her increase in industrial growth. The current power generation system in Bangladesh is largely dependent on fossil fuel that will creates difficulties to meet the demand in near future. Moreover, this bulk power generation system also seriously affects the wildlife and the environment around the densely populated areas. This environmental and energy crisis can be reduced by appropriate utilization renewable energy such as solar power, wind, hydroelectricity, tidal energy etc. This paper deals with the possible utilization of renewable sources of energy instead of conventional sources to ensure energy security by analyzing current status and predicted future demand.

TI  - Thermodynamic performance comparison of various energy storage systems from source-to-electricity for renewable energy resources
AB  - This study discusses and thermodynamically analyzes several energy storage systems, namely; pumped-hydro, compressed air, hot water storage, molten salt thermal storage, hydrogen, ammonia, lithium-ion battery, Zn-air battery, redox flow battery, reversible fuel cells, supercapacitors, and superconducting magnetic storage through the first and second law of thermodynamics. By fixing an electrical output of 100 kW for all systems, the energy efficiencies obtained for the considered energy storage methods vary between 10.9% and 74.6% whereas, the exergy efficiencies range between 23.1% and 71.9%. The exergy destruction rates are also calculated for each system ranging from 1.640 kW to 356 kW. The highest destruction rate is obtained for the solar-driven molten salt thermal energy storage system since it includes thermal energy conversion via the heliostat field. Furthermore, the roundtrip efficiencies for the electrochemical and electromagnetic storage systems are compared with the analyzed systems, ranging from 58% to 94%. Renewable sources (solar, wind, ocean current, biomass, and geothermal) energy conversion efficiencies are also considered for the final round-trip performances. The molten salt and hot water systems are applicable to solar, geothermal, and biomass. The highest source-to-electricity efficiency is obtained for the super magnetic storage with 37.6% when using wind, ocean current, and biomass sources. Â© 2020 The Author(s)

The microalgae, like Scenedesmus obliquus, Neochloris oleabundans, Nannochloropsis sp., Chlorella emersonii, and Dunaliella tertiolecta have high oil content. Among the known algae, Scenedesmus obliquus is one of the most potential sources for biodiesel as it has adequate fatty acid (linolenic acid) and other polyunsaturated fatty acids. Bio-ethanol is already in the market of United States of America and Europe as an additive in gasoline.

Nearly all shipping-related emissions occur within 400 km of land and cause death and morbidity to millions of people. The initial greenhouse gas strategy on the reduction of carbon emissions to at least half of its 2008 levels by 2050, adopted by the International Maritime Organization, has the potential to spur innovations and alternative fuel, enabling the shipping industry to adapt to future challenges. Some zero-emission options such as the use of hydrogen and biofuels are considered potential strategies, but they lack the infrastructure capacity needed to meet the world's shipping demand. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) has gained substantial interest as a marine fuel because it can comply with the strictest environmental regulations currently in force, and it is often regarded as a future fuel as most newly constructed ships are built to run on it. Although the use of LNG leads to lower CO2 emissions compared to traditional heavy fuel oils (HFOs), there is still a need to consider further reduction. A solution which can be implemented is the use of an onboard capture system on ships, also known as ship-based carbon capture. In this study, a process and economic evaluation was carried out on a solvent-based postcombustion capture process for the energy system of a CO2 carrier. A rate-based model was developed, validated, and scaled up to process the flue gas from a Wartsila 9L46 DF marine diesel engine. Different modes of operation with respect to engine load and capture rate were analyzed in this study, and the capture cost was estimated. The cost of CO2 capture was used as an economic index for this study. It was observed via a sensitivity analysis that, at 90% capture rate, the cost of capture was at least $117/t. The effect of exhaust gas recycling was also explored, and this resulted in a considerable reduction in the capture cost. The exhaust gas waste heat was utilized and was adequate to supply the required energy needed by the reboiler at each capture rate examined. Also, for LNG-fueled CO2 ships, the cold energy obtained while converting the LNG to gas was utilized to liquefy the captured CO2 from the flue gas. Â© 2019 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Small suspension-feeding amphipods play a pivotal role in carbon dynamics around offshore man-made structures
AB  - The establishment of artificial hard substrates (i.e. offshore wind farms and oil and gas platforms) on marine soft sediments increases the available habitat for invertebrate communities that would otherwise be restricted to natural hard bottoms. Suspension feeding invertebrates clear a significant amount of particles from the water column and release organic matter in the form of feces, influencing the basis of marine food webs and affecting surrounding environments. Artificial structures in the southern North Sea are dominated by a suspension-feeding crustacean in terms of abundance and sometimes even biomass: the amphipod Jassa herdmani. Animal densities of this tiny biofouler are known to exceed 1 million individuals per m2. Despite their small body sizes and their simple filter apparatus, we hypothesized that J. herdmani is a highly effective suspension feeder with a significant impact on neighboring communities due to its high abundances. In a feeding experiment, individuals of J. herdmani were provided with either an algal or an animal diet under two different temperature regimes. Clearance rates and fecal-pellet carbon (FPC) were measured. The results revealed high clearance rates and subsequent FPC, which were more pronounced at the higher temperature. Furthermore, clearance rates and FPC varied insignificantly with different food items. We further used the current findings for upscaling calculations to the total number of offshore windfarms and oil and gas platforms in the southern North Sea. Our calculations indicated that J. herdmani alone clears 0.33â€“4.71 km3 water per year in the southern North Sea. At the same time, these amphipods release 255â€“547 tons of carbon per year by means of defecation, thus enriching the surrounding soft sediments with organic matter. Our study highlights that tiny amphipods can mediate indirect effects of man-made structures in the North Sea, which could have a profound impact on pelagic and benthic habitats. Â© 2022 The Authors

TI  - Constraints on extractable power from energetic tidal straits
AB  - National efforts to reduce energy dependency on fossil fuels have prompted examination of macrotidal nearshore sites around the United Kingdom (UK) for potential tidal stream resource development. A number of prospective tidal energy sites have been identified, but the local hydrodynamics of these sites are often poorly understood. Tidal energy developers rely on detailed characterisation of tidal energy sites prior to device installation and field trials. Although first-order appraisals may make macrotidal tidal straits appear attractive for development, detailed, site-specific hydrodynamic and bathymetric surveys are important for determining site suitability for tidal stream turbine (TST) installation. Understanding the ways in which coastal features affect tidal velocities at potential TST development sites will improve identification and analysis of physical constraints on tidal energy development. This paper presents and examines tidal velocity data measured in Ramsey Sound (Pembrokeshire, Wales, UK), an energetic macrotidal strait, which will soon host Wales' first TST demonstration project. While maximum tidal velocities in the strait during peak spring flood exceed 3ms-1, the northern portion of Ramsey Sound exhibits a marked flood-dominated tidal asymmetry. Furthermore, local bathymetric features affect flow fields that are spatially heterogeneous in three dimensions, patterns that depth-averaged velocity data (measured and modelled) tend to mask. Depth-averaging can therefore have a significant effect on power estimations. Analysis of physical and hydrodynamic characteristics in Ramsey Sound, including tidal velocities across the swept area of the pilot TST, variations in the stream flow with depth, estimated power output, water depth and bed slope, suggests that the spatial and temporal variability in the flow field may render much of Ramsey Sound unsuitable for tidal power extraction. Although the resource potential depends on velocity and bathymetric conditions that are fundamentally local, many prospective tidal energy sites are subject to similar physical and hydrodynamic constraints. Results of this study can help inform site selection in these complicated, highly dynamic macrotidal environments. In order to fully characterise the structure of the tidal currents, these data should be supplemented with 3-D modelling, particularly in areas subject to a highly irregular bathymetry and complicated tidal regime.

TI  - Conversion of mangrove forests to shrimp ponds in southeastern China destabilizes sediment microbial networks
AB  - Within the ecosystem, mangroves serve diverse functions by acting as a carbon sink, removing nitrogen, providing habitats for marine organisms, and regulating climate. Nowadays, many mangrove forests are being converted to shrimp ponds across the world, and several studies have quantified the effects of this conversion on soil carbon stocks and greenhouse gas emissions. However, its effects on the soil microbial community structure and assembly processes remain unclear. In the present study, high-throughput sequencing and multivariate statistical analyses were used to quantify the characteristics of soil microbial communities in common mangrove types in southeastern China and the adjacent converted shrimp ponds. The relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia, Cyanobacteria, and Firmicutes was significantly increased in the shrimp pond sediment compared with that in the mangrove sediment, whereas the archaea, represented by Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota, exhibited the opposite patterns. Moreover, the sediment microbial communities in the shrimp ponds exhibited more obvious biogeographical distributions than those in the mangrove habitat. Null model analysis revealed that variable selection (via deterministic processes) governed the microbial community assembly in the mangrove sediments, while dispersal limitation (via stochastic processes) shaped the microbial community structure in the shrimp pond sediments. Our findings suggest that converting mangrove forest habitats to shrimp ponds significantly alters the sediment microbial networks, rendering them unstable (by disrupting the network topology parameters such as modularity, total cohesion, and negative cohesion). This may in turn lead to alterations in various ecosystem functions in response to habitat conversion, highlighting the need for better preserving mangroves through appropriate climate change mitigation measures.

TI  - Pollution Tradeoffs for Conventional and Natural Gas-Based Marine Fuels
AB  - This paper presents a life-cycle emissions analysis of conventional and natural gas-based marine transportation in the United States. We apply a total fuel cycleor well-to-propelleranalysis that evaluates emissions along the fuel production and delivery pathway, including feedstock extraction, processing, distribution, and use. We compare emissions profiles for methanol, liquefied natural gas, and low sulfur marine fuel in our analysis, with a focus on exploring tradeoffs across the following pollutants: greenhouse gases, particulate matter, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides. For our greenhouse gas analysis, we apply global warming potentials that consider both near-term (20-year) and long-term (100-year) climate forcing impacts. We also conduct uncertainty analysis to evaluate the impacts of methane leakage within the natural gas recovery, processing, and distribution stages of its fuel cycle. Our results indicate that natural-gas based marine fuels can provide significant local environmental benefits compared to distillate fuel; however, these benefits come with a near-termand possibly long-termglobal warming penalty, unless such natural gas-based fuels are derived from renewable feedstock, such as biomass. These results point to the importance of controlling for methane leaks along the natural gas production process and the important role that renewable natural gas can play in the shipping sector. Decision-makers can use these results to inform decisions related to increasing the use of alternative fuels in short sea and coast-wise marine transportation systems.

TI  - Market stimulation of renewable-based power generation in Australia
AB  - This paper attempts to identify the types of renewable-based power generation technologies available in Australia that have the capacity to contribute to the growth of the renewable energy sector and then suggest what type of economic incentive instruments could be applied in order to stimulate investment in that sector. Currently in Australia there are hydro, wind, bioenergy, solar, geothermal and ocean technologies being used to produce renewable power. Of these all except hydro power has large amounts of potentially useful resources. In the cases of wind, bioenergy, solar, and geothermal, the technology is mature enough to be immediately deployed in large-scale. However, only in the cases of wind and bioenergy the costs and return on investments are proven to be viable in the current market. What is required on all fronts is an improved return on investments. Within the current electricity market competition with fossil-fuel based power is very difficult considering the ample supply of coal available in Australia and the heavy subsidies it receives. To become more competitive with electricity generated from coal-fired power plants, a feed-in tariff scheme could be implemented, and subsidies to the coal industry should be reduced if not removed. Another aspect impeding the growth of certain renewable power technologies is the high capital cost. This issue could be addressed with direct subsidies or tax exemptions, or aiding with easier access of finance options. However for particular industries such as wind and solar, it would be a further benefit if some effort is made to encourage component manufacturing within Australia. For technologies that require further technical development, funding towards R&D or pilot projects, and support for international collaboration projects would accelerate their path to deployment. It is critical that the Australian government continues to be a leader. In addition to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) and an extension to the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target Scheme (MRETS) proposed by the federal government, the Council of Australian Governments (CoAG) must work to streamline policies between the federal and state governments and the latter must apply policies unique to their region for what technology is prevalent.

TI  - Nitrogen transformation in wetlands and marshes
AB  - Biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen (N) in wetlands and marshes is complex, involving inter-conversions between different N species, as well as transfers among various storage compartments. This review attempts to provide concise information on N dynamics in wetlands and marshes, and discuss contributing factors that may help to maximize removal of N from wastewater and stormwater runoffs at the same time reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions to the atmosphere. In addition to interstitial water, N may be stored in above and belowground, live and dead plant material, invertebrates and microbes, and sorbed on the surfaces of organic and inorganic materials. The structure and functioning of the wetlands and marshes are subjected to anthropogenic activities, such as waterworks, land reclamation grazing and mowing, fertilization and various types of pollution, including heavy metals, nutrients, oil, etc. Nitrogen turnover in salt marshes is of particular interest since the primary production in salt marshes, as well as in adjacent coastal waters is considered to be limited by the supply of dissolved inorganic N. Salt marshes can function as sinks or as sources of N depending on their morphology and vegetation. Conversion pathways include ammonia volatilization, ammonification, nitrification, denitrification, anammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidation), dissimilatory reduction, and plant and microbial assimilation and remineralization during decomposition. The existence of an atmospheric sink, coupled with ammonia volatilization and microbially mediated nitrification and denitrification, make N as an excellent target for removal from wastewaters by constructed wetlands and marshes. However, such removal, specifically as N2O, a potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere may not be as wise as previously thought as the concerns of global warming keeps looming. It is apparent that unless human-derived N inputs are regulated at the source, substantial biogeochemical modification of the global coastal ocean may occur because of cyclic processes within the coastal ocean system that are not rapid enough to dissipate the effects of the perturbations. Identifying the relative importance of various permanent and temporary sinks for N in wetlands may lead to methods of optimizing the utilization of constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment. The dynamics of N transformation within constructed wetlands is particularly a good candidate for long-term study to maximize the beneficial functions that wetlands can provide, and minimize adverse effects such as N2O emission to the atmosphere.

TI  - Top-down control of carbon sequestration: grazing affects microbial structure and function in salt marsh soils
AB  - Tidal wetlands have been increasingly recognized as long-term carbon sinks in recent years. Work on carbon sequestration and decomposition processes in tidal wetlands focused so far mainly on effects of global-change factors such as sea-level rise and increasing temperatures. However, little is known about effects of land use, such as livestock grazing, on organic matter decomposition and ultimately carbon sequestration. The present work aims at understanding the mechanisms by which large herbivores can affect organic matter decomposition in tidal wetlands. This was achieved by studying both direct animal-microbe interactions and indirect animal-plant-microbe interactions in grazed and ungrazed areas of two long-term experimental field sites at the German North Sea coast. We assessed bacterial and fungal gene abundance using quantitative PCR, as well as the activity of microbial exo-enzymes by conducting fluorometric assays. We demonstrate that grazing can have a profound impact on the microbial community structure of tidal wetland soils, by consistently increasing the fungi-to-bacteria ratio by 38-42\%, and therefore potentially exerts important control over carbon turnover and sequestration. The observed shift in the microbial community was primarily driven by organic matter source, with higher contributions of recalcitrant autochthonous (terrestrial) vs. easily degradable allochthonous (marine) sources in grazed areas favoring relative fungal abundance. We propose a novel and indirect form of animal-plant-microbe interaction: top-down control of aboveground vegetation structure determines the capacity of allochthonous organic matter trapping during flooding and thus the structure of the microbial community. Furthermore, our data provide the first evidence that grazing slows down microbial exo-enzyme activity and thus decomposition through changes in soil redox chemistry. Activities of enzymes involved in C cycling were reduced by 28-40\%, while activities of enzymes involved in N cycling were not consistently affected by grazing. It remains unclear if this is a trampling-driven direct grazing effect, as hypothesized in earlier studies, or if the effect on redox chemistry is plant mediated and thus indirect. This study improves our process-level understanding of how grazing can affect the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of semi-terrestrial ecosystems that may help explain and predict differences in C turnover and sequestration rates between grazed and ungrazed systems.

TI  - Highwave off-shore energy hose
AB  - Many inshore wave energy collectors (WEC) concepts use wave energy to push water ashore to process it for energy conversion with turbines. An artificial reef design of floating HPDE pipe can be built in a harbor and installed offshore of the breaking waves in the near shore. The portable reef designed to mitigate shore erosion can serve as the shuttle and as a platform for WECs. Our research has yielded a group of simple biomorphic WEC designs. A myriad of smaller WECs have advantages of installation on the reef in a harbor. The design also considers the ease to replace or maintain the WECs. The pipe matrix structure of the reef serves as the secure conduit for hoses to bring water ashore. The reef is designed to focus and amplify wave energy using wave refraction and locates the energy directly offshore to harvest. Reduced wave energy on the inshore can be a positive result for shore management for sandy beaches. The technology considers environmental, logistical, cost and human issues for shore protection, mariculture, recreation and energy. Â© 2011 MTS.

TI  - The flow of solar energy to biofuel feedstock via photosynthesis
AB  - More than 80% of the energy required for running modern societies is produced by burning of fossil fuels. Although the stocks of oil, gas and coal are rapidly shrinking, even more alarming is that the massive burning of fossil fuels is releasing huge amounts of CO2 to the atmosphere thereby warming up the climate and polluting human habitats. In order to make the economy and welfare sustainable, the fossil fuels must be replaced by carbon neutral, clean and endless energy sources. Both the fossil fuels and most of the renewable fuels are formed by plant and microbial photosynthesis that converts solar energy into chemical energy using water as a source of electrons. More than 2.5 billion years of photosynthesis has been required to accumulate the fossil energy stocks that we are using now. The idea of biofuels is to use online photosynthesis to satisfy the energy demands of human activities. However, the net productivity of world's vegetation is not high enough to substitute the fossil energy stocks and therefore more efficient innovations to harness solar energy by photosynthetic mechanisms are required. Moreover, it is crucial to find ways to make use of oceanic environments and deserts, which from one hand catch plenty of solar energy and from the other hand do not compete with food production. Here we give an overview of the reasons behind the limited capacity of the traditional biofuel feedstocks and illustrate possibilities to enhance the photosynthetic capture and storage of solar energy.

TI  - Flow chart
AB  - Mike Scott discusses how the close links between water and energy in UK ensure that efficiencies made in one sector have a beneficial effect in the other. Oil sands are at least 20 times as water-intensive as conventional fuels, while biofuels are thousands of times more water-hungry. The latest data suggest that shale gas is seven times more water-hungry than conventional production. Coal-fired power plants are heavy water users now, but if they are fitted with carbon capture and storage equipment, their water consumption could increase by 30-100%.The particular emphasis of the water issue varies among different energy sources. In the nuclear industry, the impact of large withdrawals and the return of water to rivers and other water courses that is warmer on marine organisms is the key factor. However, when it comes to shale gas and the hydraulic fracturing used to extract it, the debate focuses on drinking water quality.

TI  - In-field applicable coatings for Corrosion and biofouling control in marine environments
AB  - Corrosion and biofouling control is an important consideration for offshore oil structures. Corrosion rates for steel exposed to seawater immersion and brine air can easily exceed 10 mils per year if left unprotected in the splash zone, while barnacles which attach in shallow tidal zones can similarly induce heavy, accelerated microbiological pitting corrosion. The subsequent deterioration of the ferrous substrates leave these structures at risk for mechanical failure, as the effects of particle impact, abrasion, wear, and erosion combine with the weakened surface structure to accelerate the loss of material. Maintenance of these critical assets often proves a logistical nightmare, when considering the limited accessibility, remote locations, and the huge expense of any interruptions in rig production. Attempts to contain the effects of corrosion are widespread, including strategies such as the introduction of chemical inhibitors to change the environment, sacrificial anodic and cathodic protection, and utilization of new highly alloyed materials. However, by far the most widely used technique is the application of specially engineered surface coatings to provide a physical and chemical barrier between the substrate and the surrounding corrosive media. Coatings can range between extremely simple hot-melted tar and liquid epoxy, which inherently have no chemical bonding to the substrate, and some slightly innate hydrophobicity, to engineered advanced systems including polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and zinc silicates with specially paired primers for maximum surface adherence and broad chemical compatibility. None of the existing coating solutions practiced to date has been able to a key fundamental: coatings cannot be used as part of a refurbishment strategy to restore performance and production to existing structures after fouling. The purpose of this project was to develop a multifunctional, omniphobic coating with superior substrate adhesion such that it could fill in and plug surface crevices and pits stemming from corrosion. Additionally, unlike most other coatings, this surface adhesion could be attained through in-field application, either on exposed surfaces through aerosolized spray, or on the interior of transport pipelines via an in-line coating method. This paper will highlight various applications of the coating system on platform fixtures and supporting infrastructure, and how it can improve operational efficiency and extend the usable lifetimes of the selected assets. Offering abrasion resistance and an extremely low surface roughness finish, the coating has been demonstrated to actively repel both water and oil-based mixtures, as well as prevent the attachment and growth of typical marine biologicals such as barnacles and microbial algae. Suitable for nearly any substrate, this paper shall describe multiple ways in which the coating was deployed to combat not only corrosion on the platform itself, but also reduce drag in inspection underwater unmanned vehicles (UUV), and in offering flow assurance when used to refurbish a transport pipeline.

TI  - An observing system simulation for Southern Ocean carbon dioxide uptake
AB  - The Southern Ocean is critically important to the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2. Up to half of the excess CO2 currently in the ocean entered through the Southern Ocean. That uptake helps to maintain the global carbon balance and buffers transient climate change from fossil fuel emissions. However, the future evolution of the uptake is uncertain, because our understanding of the dynamics that govern the Southern Ocean CO2 uptake is incomplete. Sparse observations and incomplete model formulations limit our ability to constrain the monthly and annual uptake, interannual variability and long-term trends. Float-based sampling of ocean biogeochemistry provides an opportunity for transforming our understanding of the Southern Ocean CO2 flux. In this work, we review current estimates of the CO 2 uptake in the Southern Ocean and projections of its response to climate change. We then show, via an observational system simulation experiment, that float-based sampling provides a significant opportunity for measuring the mean fluxes and monitoring the mean uptake over decadal scales.

TI  - Electricity generation options for a future low carbon energy mix for Malaysia
AB  - Malaysia's electricity generation mix is mainly based on fossil fuels, particularly natural gas and coal with a smaller share of large hydroelectric and non-hydroelectric renewable energy resources. The present work aims to analyse and assess the ongoing search for alternatives to fossil fuel for electricity generation that the country has been pursuing both environmental preservation and national energy security considerations, thereby suggesting the way forward including potential options to be deliberated. This paper surveys alternative, both practical and theoretical that can be considered technically and economically attractive for Malaysia over the period to 2050. The overall national energy supply and demand situation are first analysed to develop projections that account for the role of renewable energy, particularly that of solar photovoltaic (PV). Next, the paper discusses the progress achieved, and the current status of the national solar PV industry presents the advantages or benefits offered and outlines the remaining challenges. In the same manner, electricity generation from the biogas produced from methane recovery in treating palm oil mill effluent (POME) is assessed. In the final analysis, the paper considers other potential low carbon power generation options to make up the Malaysian energy mix, which include small hydroelectricity, municipal solid waste decomposition in suitably-engineered landfills, nuclear energy using thorium-based technology, and renewable marine energy particularly ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), in tandem with savings expected from energy efficiency and conservation (EE&C) initiatives.

TI  - Microalgal wastewater treatment technologies
AB  - Climate change is a defining issue of our time and we are at a defining moment. From shifting weather pattern to rising sea levels that increase the risk of catastrophic flooding, the impact of climate change is global. Wastewater generation has concomitantly increased with the rise of human population. The uncontrolled discharge of wastewater may lead to serious environmental and health concerns. These have paved way for the search for renewable energy and simultaneous development of suitable waste treatment technologies. Microalgae have the potential to generate renewable energy with concomitant treatment of wastewater. Algal biotechnology can provide a sustainable solution to the problems ranging from greenhouse gas reduction to bioremediation of wastewater and generation of biofuels.

TI  - Marine antifoulants
AB  - Effective antifouling brings enormous economic benefits to the shipping industry. There are also indirect environmental benefits. Ships with clean hulls use less fuel, reducing emissions of 'greenhouse' and 'acid rain' gases, and they also provide less opportunity for 'invasive' species to hitch-hike across the world's oceans. The use of tributyltin (TBT), first in free association paints and then in self-polishing copolymers (TBT SPC), were breakthroughs for the paint industry-they are the most efficient antifoulants ever devised. Unfortunately, TBT leaches from the paints into the water column and caused harm to some non-target organisms, particularly during the period when it was used solely in free association paints. The best-documented impacts are on cultivated oysters Crassostrea gigas in west France and dogwhelks Nucella lapillus in Britain, but similar impacts were described worldwide. The use of TBT-based antifoulants was regulated in several countries during the 1980s and early 1990s. In most cases, their use was prohibited on small vessels (<25 m in length) which were believed to be the main cause of contamination in coastal waters. These regulations have been effective in reducing ambient levels of TBT in the water column, sediments (although less so) and in the tissues of marine organisms. Open waters are now largely free of contamination at biologically harmful levels but commercial harbours, especially those with dry docks, are still hot-spots of contamination. Nevertheless, even in these cases, impacts are localised. The International Maritime Organisation is likely to ban the use of TBT-based paints altogether in the near future but there is a danger that this measure will be introduced prematurely. The ban should not be enforced until alternative antifoulants are available which perform as well as TBT-based coatings on economic and environmental cost-benefit analyses.

TI  - The steady state anaerobic digestion of Laminaria hyperborea - Effect of hydraulic residence on biogas production and bacterial community composition
AB  - Methane production by anaerobic digestion (AD) of macroalgae (seaweed) is a promising algal bioenergy option. Work presented here is primarily based on the AD of Laminaria hyperborea using batch and continuously stirred tank reactors. Extrapolation of data from batch studies to long term continuous reactors was unreliable. A conservative organic loading rate (OLR) of 1 g L-1 d(-1) was used due to difficulties experienced in achieving steady state performance at an OLR of 1.5 g L-1 d(-1). Biogas composition and methane yields (60-70\%) were near to values expected from terrestrial feedstocks. Biomass washout, as imposed by the dilution rate (i.e., hydraulic residence), had considerable bearing on the biogas generation profile, particularly at >3 hydraulic residences. Inhibition of methanogen growth was linked to nutrient deficiency and potentially antimicrobial compounds associated with the feedstock. Anaerobic digestion of L. hyperborea proved feasible over extended operational periods. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Enhanced biological carbon consumption in a high CO2 ocean
AB  - The oceans have absorbed nearly half of the fossil-fuel carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted into the atmosphere since pre-industrial times 1, causing a measurable reduction in seawater pH and carbonate saturation2. If CO2 emissions continue to rise at current rates, upper-ocean pH will decrease to levels lower than have existed for tens of millions of years and, critically, at a rate of change 100 times greater than at anytime over this period3. Recent studies have shown effects of ocean acidification on a variety of marine life forms, in particular calcifying organisms4-6. Consequences at the community to ecosystem level, in contrast, are largely unknown. Here we show that dissolved inorganic carbon consumption of a natural plankton community maintained in mesocosm enclosures at initial CO2 partial pressures of 350,700 and 1,050 Î¼atm increases with rising CO2. The community consumed up to 39% more dissolved inorganic carbon at increased CO2 partial pressures compared to present levels, whereas nutrient uptake remained the same. The stoichiometry of carbon to nitrogen drawdown increased from 6.0 at low CO2 to 8.0 at high CO2, thus exceeding the Redfield carbon:nitrogen ratio of 6.6 in today's ocean7. This excess carbon consumption was associated with higher loss of organic carbon from the upper layer of the stratified mesocosms. If applicable to the natural environment, the observed responses have implications for a variety of marine biological and biogeochemical processes, and underscore the importance of biologically driven feedbacks in the ocean to global change.

TI  - Carbon release and transformation from coastal peat deposits controlled by submarine groundwater discharge: a column experiment study
AB  - Although the majority of coastal sediments consist of sandy material, in some areas marine ingression caused the submergence of terrestrial carbon-rich peat soils. This affects the coastal carbon balance, as peat represents a potential carbon source. We performed a column experiment to better understand the coupled flow and biogeochemical processes governing carbon transformations in submerged peat under coastal fresh groundwater (GW) discharge and brackish water intrusion. The columns contained naturally layered sediments with and without peat (organic carbon content in peat 39 +/- 14 wt\%), alternately supplied with oxygen-rich brackish water from above and oxygen-poor, low-saline GW from below. The low-saline GW discharge through the peat significantly increased the release and ascent of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the peat (delta C-13(DOC) - 26.9 parts per thousand to - 27.7 parts per thousand), which was accompanied by the production of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), implying DOC mineralization. Oxygen respiration, sulfate (SO42-) reduction, and methane (CH4) formation were differently pronounced in the sediments and were accompanied with higher microbial abundances in peat compared to sand with SO42--reducing bacteria clearly dominating methanogens. With decreasing salinity and SO42- concentrations, CH4 emission rates increased from 16.5 to 77.3 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) during a 14-day, low-saline GW discharge phase. In contrast, oxygenated brackish water intrusion resulted in lower DOC and DIC pore water concentrations and significantly lower CH4 and CO2 emissions. Our study illustrates the strong dependence of carbon cycling in shallow coastal areas with submerged peat deposits on the flow and mixing dynamics within the subterranean estuary.

TI  - Effect of mineral loaded biochar on the leaching performances of nitrate and phosphate in two contrasting soils from the coastal estuary area
AB  - Coastal estuary area is an important sink for the land-based or/and atmosphere-based nutrients, and is suffering a serious destruction derived from the intensifying human activities, which subsequently threatens the marine environment. Therefore, increasing soil retention capacities of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) and reducing their leaching amount to sea water become a critical issue needed to be urgently addressed. In this study, a 38-day incubation and leaching experiment was conducted with two contrasting soils taken from the coastal estuary area, including the wetland and agricultural soils. Four kinds of biochars (BC), including one pure reed straw BC (BC0), and three mineral loaded BCs produced through the co-pyrolysis of reed straw with CaO (BCCa), MgO (BCMg), and shell powder (BCSP), respectively, were used to explore their effects on the leaching performances of nitrate-N and phosphate-P. The results demonstrated that the application of mineral loaded BCs could generally decrease the leaching amount of phosphate-P, while showed little effect on the nitrate-N leaching, compared to the controls. The positive improvement in soil nutrient retention capacity, mostly contributed by the increased adsorption on BC surface and into aperture, was suggested as the main mechanism for the decrease in nitrate-N and phosphate-P leaching. Compared to the agricultural soil, high clay content in the wetland soil could weaken the reduction potential in leaching losses of nitrate-N and phosphate-P derived from the newly introduced minerals with BC application. Furthermore, our results also indicated that the mineral loaded BCs may slow down the conversion rate of nutrients from organic forms to inorganic forms supported by the decreased enzymatic activity, which would be beneficial to the long term retention of nutrients in soil. Overall, based on the findings in the present study, the BCMg and Ca loaded BCs were respectively recommended for the wetland and agricultural soils. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A chemical fuel is required
AB  - It was shown that fusion energy sources have excellent characteristics for future base load energy needs. However, fusion is limited to the production of heat, and from heat, electricity. This is also a limitation of most of the other alternatives to fossil fuels examined earlier. Solar thermal and geothermal energy sources produce only heat and, from heat, electricity. Power plants using solar photovoltaic, wind, tidal and ocean thermal gradients only produce electricity. Solar energy collected as biomass can yield carbon-based chemical fuels that can be handled in the same manner as fossil fuels, but like fossil fuels they are more valuable for other uses and can cause significant pollution. No matter what future combination of these energy sources is adopted there are many important uses for energy that cannot be satisfied with heat, electricity or biomass fuels. A manufactured chemical fuel is needed. The handling of energy, including transport and storage is examined, and the case is made that a portable, storable energy carrier is required for all users of energy. Â© 1994.

TI  - Influence of ancient anthropogenic activities on the mangrove soil microbiome
AB  - Mangroves are highly productive ecosystems located at the transition between the terrestrial and marine environments. Mangroves play an important role in carbon storage, nutrient cycling and support for the marine food web. Mangrove soils are formed by fine particles rich in organic carbon and are subject to constant fluctuations in oxygen, salinity and nutrient availability due to fresh water flux and tidal variations. Microbes play an important role in nutrient cycling in mangrove soils; however, studies on the mangrove soil microbiome are scarce. Here we compare the microbiome of pristine mangrove soil located in an environmentally protected area in Guaratuba, Southern Brazil, with the microbiome of mangrove soil affected by the presence of carbonaceaous debris eroding from an archeological site known as Sambaqui. We show that although the Sambaqui site has a major effect on soil chemistry, increasing the soil pH by 2.6 units, only minor changes in the soil microbiome were detected indicating resilience of the microbial community to pH variations. The high alpha diversity indexes and predicted metabolic potential suggest that the mangrove soil microbiome not only provides important ecological services but also may host a broad range of microbes and genes of biotechnological interest.

TI  - Evaluation of the biogas potential of mucilage formed in the Marmara Sea
AB  - The mucilage, which emerged as a result of increasing global warming and the deterioration of marine ecosystem balances, has taken the Marmara Sea under its influence. Mucilage appears in some periods and there is not much information about its bioenergy production potential. In this study, the biogas and biohydrogen production potential was determined when mucilage collected from the coasts is used as a substrate. Different S/X ratios were evaluated for biogas production. The highest biogas production was observed as 682 ml/g VS at the S/X ratio of 2. Dark fermentation was carried out using mixed Clostridium sp. to produce biohydrogen. As a result of fermentation, a maximum biohydrogen yield of 117 ml H2/g VS hydrogen was obtained. In terms of both biogas and hydrogen results, the bioenergy potentials of the mucilage sample taken from the surface were determined to be higher than the bottom sediment.

TI  - Mechanisms of transformation of various forms of carbon and cycling pathways in the hooghly estuarine system
AB  - The accelerating increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and its implications for climate change are of immense concern. The Hooghly estuary, along with the luxuriant mangroves of Sundarban is one of the world's unique ecosystems. Recent studies of this estuarine system reveal the potentially important role of the estuary in regulating atmospheric CO2. Phytoplankton fix gaseous CO2 from the atmosphere into organic carbon through photosynthesis; the carbon is then transformed through subsequent steps in the food chain. Mangrove litter, transported by tidal action, is the key contributor of soil organic carbon (SOC) to the estuary. Following standard techniques, we quantified several forms of carbon, including litter carbon, SOC, soil inorganic carbon (SIC), total aqueous organic carbon (TOC), dissolved aqueous organic carbon (DOC), aqueous particulate organic carbon (POC), aqueous dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and carbon content of phytoplankton and zooplankton. To study relationships of the various forms of carbon to physical and chemical factors, we measured litter biomass, soil salinity, soil pH, redox potential, soil temperature, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity and pH. Statistical correlation analyses were then employed to assess how relationships between carbon forms and physical-chemical factors might contribute to regulating the organic carbon cycle. From this study, we have worked out a conceptual model of organic carbon cycling dynamics, and gained insight into mechanisms of transformation of different forms of carbon and the fundamental seasonal processes associated with carbon cycling in the estuarine system.

TI  - Oceans and electrical power
AB  - What could replace our exhausting fossil fuels? The nuclear solution has generated considerable controversy and land opposition. Atomic fusion is by no means close to implementation; direct solar energy is abundant, but its conversion at an acceptable cost has not been as yet developed. Geothermal energy has been tapped, but it is only locally available and is non-renewable. In the first of this two-part paper, alternative ocean-sources of energy are reviewed, some of which hold reasonable promise, like bioconversion and salinity differentials; and others, like thermal exchange, are suitable for immediate harnessing.

TI  - Seasonal marine carbon system processes in an Arctic coastal landfast sea ice environment observed with an innovative underwater sensor platform
AB  - Studying carbon dioxide in the ocean helps to understand how the ocean will be impacted by climate change and respond to increasing fossil fuel emissions. The marine carbonate system is not well characterized in the Arctic, where challenging logistics and extreme conditions limit observations of atmospheric CO2 flux and ocean acidification. Here, we present a high-resolution marine carbon system data set covering the complete cycle of sea-ice growth and melt in an Arctic estuary (Nunavut, Canada). This data set was collected through three consecutive yearlong deployments of sensors for pH and partial pressure of CO2 in seawater (pCO(2sw)) on a cabled underwater observatory. The sensors were remarkably stable compared to discrete samples: While corrections for offsets were required in some instances, we did not observe significant drift over the deployment periods. Our observations revealed a strong seasonality in this marine carbon system. Prior to sea-ice formation, air-sea gas exchange and respiration were the dominant processes, leading to increasing pCO(2sw) and reduced aragonite saturation state (Omega(Ar)). During sea-ice growth, water column respiration and brine rejection (possibly enriched in dissolved inorganic carbon, relative to alkalinity, due to ikaite precipitation in sea ice) drove pCO(2sw)to supersaturation and lowered Omega(Ar)to < 1. Shortly after polar sunrise, the ecosystem became net autotrophic, returning pCO(2sw) to undersaturation. The biological community responsible for this early switch to autotrophy (well before ice algae or phytoplankton blooms) requires further investigation. After sea-ice melt initiated, an under-ice phytoplankton bloom strongly reduced aqueous carbon (chlorophyll-a max of 2.4 mu g L-1), returning Omega(Ar) to > 1 after 4.5 months of undersaturation. Based on simple extrapolations of anthropogenic carbon inventories, we suspect that this seasonal undersaturation would not have occurred naturally. At ice breakup, the sensor platform recorded low pCO(2sw) (230 mu atm), suggesting a strong CO2 sink during the open water season.

TI  - A state-of-the-art review on dual purpose seaweeds utilization for wastewater treatment and crude bio-oil production
AB  - Due to the negative environmental impacts of fossil fuels and the increasing global energy demands, biofuels are receiving increasing attention as the best short-term substitute for petroleum. Recently, thermochemical con version of seaweeds is in industrial focus to obtain high-value products with more potential applications than the conventional raw material. Beside biofuel production and due to their autotrophic growth, seaweeds are receiving a great attention in the field of bioremediation. Thus, pyrolysis of seaweeds is a promising approach for renewable bio-oil production with positive environmental impacts. However, a pretreatment drying step is required to improve the conversion process of the biomass. Application of electro-osmotic dewatering as well as on-site mechanical dewatering methods prior to the drying process were reported as useful techniques to reduce the energy requirements. On the other hand, the bio-oil produced from pyrolysis of seaweeds usually has high contents of oxygen-, nitrogenand sulphur-containing compounds, which should be as minimum as possible to enhance the bio-oil stability and reduce NOx and SOx emissions. The present review introduces a suggested route combining a number of technologies that create an economically-feasible process for conversion of seaweeds to high-grade crude bio-oil through pyrolysis. In addition, the paper sheds light on the environmental impacts and economic feasibility of the crude bio-oil production from seaweeds. The current status and challenges related to pyrolysis, as well as future perspectives for enhanced conversion and upgraded bio-oil production, are discussed.

TI  - Hydrothermal liquefaction of Malaysia's algal biomass for high-quality bio-oil production
AB  - Currently, fossil materials form the majority of our energy and chemical source. Many global concerns force us to rethink about our current dependence on the fossil energy. Limiting the use of these energy sources is a key priority for most countries that pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The application of biomass, as substitute fossil resources for producing biofuels, plastics and chemicals, is a widely accepted strategy for sustainable development. Aquatic plants including algae possess competitive advantages as biomass resources compared to the terrestrial plants in this current global situation. Bio-oil production from algal biomass is technically and economically viable, cost competitive, requires no capacious lands and minimal water use and reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide. The aim of this paper is to review the potential of converting algal biomass, as an aquatic plant, into high-quality crude bio-oil through applicable processes in Malaysia. In particular, bio-based materials and fuels from algal biomass are considered as one of the reliable alternatives for clean energy. Currently, pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) are two foremost processes for bio-oil production from biomass. HTL can directly convert high-moisture algal biomass into bio-oil, whereas pyrolysis requires feedstock drying to reduce the energy consumption during the process. Microwave-assisted HTL, which can be conducted in aqueous environment, is suitable for aquatic plants and wet biomass such as algae. Â© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

TI  - A novel biological treatment of hydrothermal carbonization wastewater by using Thraustochytrium striatum
AB  - Hydrothermal conversion (HC) is a promising thermochemical technology to produce biofuels and bioproducts from biomass. However, the disposal of HC aqueous product (HC-AP) is one of the biggest challenges. This research investigated a new biological method using a marine protist, Thraustochytrium striatum to treat HC-AP from hydrothermal carbonization of municipal solid waste. A full factorial experiment was carried out to examine the effects of operation conditions on HC-AP treatment regarding cell growth, cellular lipid accumulation, and removals of total organic carbon (TOC)/total nitrogen (TN)/total phosphorus (TP)/recalcitrant compounds. Among four factors, only dilution rate and nitrogen concentration had significant effects on all responses, while salinity and pH were insignificant. Under the optimum conditions, T. striatum achieved 1.27 g/L dry cell mass and 14 % cellular lipid content while removing 82 % TOC, 53 % TN, 94 % TP, and âˆ¼89 % refractory compounds. This research offers a new biological platform for HC-AP treatment and valorization. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Solar-macro-alage based biogas hybrid system for future offshore installation
AB  - Marine algae biomass energy source is increasing getting approval from policy maker and community. Beside production of seaweed for biomass energy has potential economic benefits in Malaysia. Prototype plantations have been deployed in coastal areas and therefore are competing for limited space with other shoreside activities such as recreation and industry. If seaweed can be cultivated in relatively deeper waters away from populated areas, production may be expanded using larger areas not presently exploited for other purposes. Prototype systems aquaculture plantations have so far relied on ad hoc, field developed mooring systems, rather than engineering design principles. Such systems may not be sufficiently reliable for deepwater deployments, where repairs are more costly and resources are scarce. Considerable experience and hands-on knowledge has been obtained, the design concepts can be used as a basis for further improvements. The paper describe integrative approach to ocean energy by combining capability of solar and biogas.

TI  - How can the commercial potential of microalgae from the Dunaliella genus be improved? The importance of nucleotide metabolism with a focus on nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK)
AB  - Over recent decades, wide-ranging research has been focused on algae due to their potential applications, e.g., for biomass, extract and ``third{''}-generation biofuel production. In particular, microalgae, which are very fastgrowing organisms with low nutrient requirements, are ideal research objects. This review focuses on one of the most significant microalgae genus, i.e., Dunaliella, which includes D. salina and D. tertiolecta. The valuable components of these unicellular eukaryotes include glycerol, carotenoids (such as zeaxanthin and beta-carotene) and many others, which mainly accumulate when these microalgae are affected by stress conditions (i.e., hypersaline and oxidative stress). The rapid growth of these microalgae in artificial/natural systems certainly has to be based not only on nutrient uptake and photosynthesis rates but also on efficient nucleotide metabolism. Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPKs), which are considered conserved housekeeping proteins responsible for nucleotide turnover, could play an important role in this context, together with proper mitochondrial and chloroplast function. A more detailed understanding of the biochemical nature of Dunaliella spp. will help optimize the massive cultivation of these microorganisms. Ultimately, it will facilitate the greater use of coastal waters to multiply Dunaliella biomass production significantly. This strategy will save freshwater resources, e.g., in obtaining land plant oils to make biofuels. Greater access to different algal bioactive compounds may support the treatment of various diseases, such as asthma, eye diseases, cancer, and viral infections.

TI  - Biodiesel production from Neochloris oleoabundans by supercritical technology
AB  - Oleaginous microalgae have been proposed as a sustainable alternative biomass to produce biodiesel in order to substitute conventional vegetable oils derived from oilseed crops. Particularly, recent studies pointed out the potential of N. oleoabundans, cultured in seawater or in anaerobically digested dairy manure, to produce triglycerides with high content of monounsaturated fatty acids. The supercritical technology has been recognized as a green sustainable alternative to transform biomass into valuable products. Thus, the aim of the present wok was to study the direct supercritical alcohol processing of partially dried N. oleoabundans biomass and later reaction products fractionation by supercritical CO2 or liquid n-hexane. A direct alcoholysis of microalgae biomass was carried out at different temperatures (250 degrees C and 280 degrees C) and increasing reaction times in order to evaluate the fatty acid ester production. Bio-oils from microalgae with up to 35 wt.\% fatty acid esters were obtained by two fold extraction with n-hexane. Conversely, supercritical CO2 fractionation produced upgraded bio-oils with up to 74 wt.\% of fatty acid esters content.

TI  - Introducing a marine biorefinery system for the integrated production of biofuels, high-value-chemicals, and co-products: A path forward to a sustainable future
AB  - Biofuels have many environmental and practical benefits as a transportation fuel. They are among the best alternatives to fossil fuels-thanks to their capacity for negative carbon emissions, which is vital for archiving the global ambition of a net-zero economy. However, conventional biofuel production takes place on inland sites and relies on freshwater and edible crops (or land suitable for edible crop production), which has led to the food versus fuel debate. It also suffers technical and economical barriers owing to the energy balance and the cost of production compared with fossil fuels. Establishing a coastal integrated marine biorefinery (CIMB) system for the simultaneous production of biofuels, high-value chemicals, and other co-products could be the ultimate solution. The proposed system is based on coastal sites and relies entirely on marine resources including seawater, marine biomass (seaweed), and marine microorganisms (marine yeasts and marine microal-gae). The system does not require the use of arable land and freshwater in any part of the production chain and should be linked to offshore renewable energy sources to increase its economic feasibility and environmental value. This article aims to introduce the CIMB system as a potential vehicle for addressing the global warming issue and speeding the global effort on climate change mitigation as well as supporting the worldâ€™s water, food and energy security. I hope these perspectives serve to draw attention into research funding for this approach. Â© 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Designer photosynthetic organisms for photobiological production of ethanol from carbon dioxide and water
AB  - This chapter describes an invention on photosynthetic ethanol production through application of synthetic biology. The designer plants, designer algae, and designer plant cells are created such that the endogenous photosynthesis regulation mechanism is tamed, and the reducing power (NADPH) and energy (ATP) acquired from the photosynthetic water splitting and proton gradient-coupled electron transport process are used for immediate synthesis of ethanol (CH3CH2OH) directly from carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). This photobiological ethanol-production method eliminates the problem of recalcitrant lignocellulosics by bypassing the bottleneck problem of the conventional biomass technology. The photosynthetic ethanol-production technology is expected to have a much higher solar-to-ethanol energy-conversion efficiency than the conventional technology. Furthermore, this approach enables the use of seawater for photobiological production of ethanol without requiring freshwater or agricultural soil, since the designer photosynthetic organisms can be created from certain marine algae that can use seawater.

TI  - Measurements of Emissions to Air from a Marine Engine Fueled by Methanol
AB  - Emissions of exhaust gases and particulate matter from a dual fuel marine engine using methanol as fuel with marine gasoil as pilot fuel have been examined for a ferry during operation. The emission factor for nitrogen oxides is lower than what is typically found for marine gasoil but does not reach the tier III limit. The emissions of particulate matter are significantly lower than for fuel oils and similar to what is found for LNG engines. The main part of the particles can be found in the ultrafine range with the peak being at around 18 nm. About 93\% of the particles are evaporated and absorbed when using a thermodenuder, and thus a large majority of the particles are volatile. Methanol is a potential future marine fuel that will reduce emissions of air pollutants and can be made as a biofuel to meet emission targets for greenhouse gases.

TI  - The possible roles of algae in restricting the increase in atmospheric CO2 and global temperature
AB  - Anthropogenic inputs are increasing the CO2 content of the atmosphere, and the CO2 and total inorganic C in the surface ocean and, to a lesser degree, the deep ocean. The greenhouse effect of the increased CO2 (and, to a lesser extent, other greenhouse gases) is very probably the major cause of present global warming. The warming increases temperature of the atmosphere and the surface ocean to a greater extent than the deep ocean, with shoaling of the thermocline, decreasing nutrient flux to the surface ocean where there is greater mean photosynthetic photon flux density. These global changes influence algae in nature. However, it is clear that algae are important, via the biological pump, in decreasing the steady state atmospheric and ocean surface CO2, and thus decreasing radiative forcing, a reduction enhanced by algal increases in albedo. As well as these natural processes there are possibilities that algae can, with human intervention, partly offset the increase in atmospheric CO2. One possibility is to grow algae as sources of fuel for transport, in principle providing an energy source that is close to CO2-neutral. The other possibility is to increase the role of algae in sequestering CO2 as organic C over periods of hundreds or more years in the deep ocean and marine sediments and/or increasing albedo and decreasing radiative forcing of temperature. There are problems, currently unresolved, in the economically viable production of algal biofuels without carbon trading subsidies. Enhanced algal CO2 sequestration also has costs, both in resource input (phosphorus (P) from high P content rocks, a limited resource with a competing use as an agricultural fertilizer) and adverse environmental effects. For example, ocean anoxic zones producing N2O and increased algal production of short-lived halocarbons by algae that both, through breakdown, destroy O-3 and increase UV flux to the Earth's surface.

TI  - Can CCS and NET enable the continued use of fossil carbon fuels after CoP21?
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) does not generate energy. CCS applied to fossil and modern bio-carbon fuels and feedstocks removes environmentally damaging CO2 emissions. CoP21 stipulated a maximum 2A degrees C-1.5A degrees C global warming from 2050 in perpetuity. Both CCS and negative emission technology (NET) are now required to manage the carbon stock in earth's atmosphere and oceans. All components of CCS are operationally proven secure at the industrial scale. Fifteen CCS projects operate globally; seven are under construction. CCS systems increase electricity prices, to about A 100 pound/MWhr. CCS on industry is cheaper and storage costs minimal (A 5-20 pound/tonne). CCS reduces whole economy costs of carbon transition by 2.5 times. Policies of capex subsidy, oversupplied emissions certificates, weak carbon pricing, and weak emissions standards have all failed to develop large cost CCS mega-projects. New carbon certificates could link the extraction of carbon to an obligation to store a percentage of emissions. Certificates connect CCS and NET pathways to secure carbon storage for the public good.

TI  - Ten lessons on the resilience of the EU common fisheries policy towards climate change and fuel efficiency -Â A call for adaptive, flexible and well-informed fisheries management
AB  - To effectively future-proof the management of the European Union fishing fleets we have explored a suite of case studies encompassing the northeast and tropical Atlantic, the Mediterranean, Baltic and Black Seas. This study shows that European Union (EU) fisheries are likely resilient to climate-driven short-term stresses, but may be negatively impacted by long-term trends in climate change. However, fisheriesâ€™ long-term stock resilience can be improved (and therefore be more resilient to increasing changes in climate) by adopting robust and adaptive fisheries management, provided such measures are based on sound scientific advice which includes uncertainty. Such management requires regular updates of biological reference points. Such updates will delineate safe biological limits for exploitation, providing both high long-term yields with reduced risk of stock collapse when affected by short-term stresses, and enhanced compliance with advice to avoid higher than intended fishing mortality. However, high resilience of the exploited ecosystem does not necessarily lead to the resilience of the economy of EU fisheries from suffering shocks associated with reduced yields, neither to a reduced carbon footprint if fuel use increases from lower stock abundances. Fuel consumption is impacted by stock development, but also by changes in vessel and gear technologies, as well as fishing techniques. In this respect, energy-efficient fishing technologies already exist within the EU, though implementing them would require improving the uptake of innovations and demonstrating to stakeholders the potential for both reduced fuel costs and increased catch rates. A transition towards reducing fuel consumption and costs would need to be supported by the setup of EU regulatory instruments. Overall, to effectively manage EU fisheries within a changing climate, flexible, adaptive, well-informed and well-enforced management is needed, with incentives provided for innovations and ocean literacy to cope with the changing conditions, while also reducing the dependency of the capture fishing industry on fossil fuels. To support such management, we provide 10 lessons to characterize â€˜win-winâ€™ fishing strategies for the European Union, which develop leverages in which fishing effort deployed corresponds to Maximum Sustainable Yield targets and Common Fisheries Policy minimal effects objectives. In these strategies, higher catch is obtained in the long run, less fuel is spent to attain the catch, and the fisheries have a higher resistance and resilience to shock and long-term factors to face climate-induced stresses.

TI  - Long-Term Performance of Segmented Benthic Microbial Fuel Cells
AB  - Benthic microbial fuel cells (BMFCs) are a class of bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) that are an emerging technology under development for applications of persistent ocean monitoring. BMFCs function via anaerobic bacteria metabolizing organic matter in sediment and providing electrons to buried anodes. These anodes are electrically connected via an external circuit to an aerobic cathode positioned in the water column. Previous projects by this same group involved large-scale deployments that demonstrated deployment of BMFC systems via a boat-towed sled. These long carpet like anodes (termed ``Magic Carpet{''}) have been shown to generate power densities of 5-10 mW m(-2) in systems ranging from 10 - 40 m(2) systems. A major challenge in the field remains scaling up these systems to generate practical levels of power. This paper evaluates two iterations of segmented 20 m(2) Magic Carpet BMFC systems and compares their long-term performance.

TI  - Investigation of Growth, Lipid Productivity, and Fatty Acid Profiles in Marine Bloom-Forming Dinoflagellates as Potential Feedstock for Biodiesel
AB  - Microalgae-based biodiesel is increasingly recognized as an alternative to crop-based biodiesel. In this study, 10 local strains of dinoflagellates collected from Hong Kong waters, including a monoculture and field sample ofScrippsiella sp.isolated from an algal bloom, were evaluated against the performance of green algaTetraselmis suecica. The specific growth rate, biomass production, lipid productivity, and fatty acid profile were investigated. The total lipid content of isolated strains ranged from 16.2\% to 32.2\% of the total dry biomass, whereas palmitic acid (C16:0) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6n3) were dominant in the fatty acid profile.Scrippsiella sp.has a high lipid productivity (47.3 mg/L/day) and fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) content (55.2-73 mg/g dry weight (dw)), which were comparable to that in green algaT. suecica. Further, monoculture and field sampled bloomingScrippsiella sp.showed no significant difference in most parameters, suggesting the possibility of harvesting a natural algal bloom population as a mitigation strategy to harmful algal bloom and to use as biodiesel feedstock. Overall, dinoflagellate species showed a slower growth rate (0.04-0.57 day(-1)) than most compared species (0.07-1.34 day(-1)), likely due to a large genome size and low chlorophyll to carbon ratio. Notably, most investigated dinoflagellates were not ideal for mass biodiesel production due to the low growth rate and lipid productivity. However, a high level of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in dinoflagellates are prospective for further studies in other biotechnological applications. Though effectively harvesting algal blooming biomass can be complex, it can be further explored as a strategy for algal bloom mitigation and potentially creating values at the advantage of natural bloom when applying harvested biomass for biodiesel and bioactive compounds extraction.

TI  - Microbes help to drive global carbon cycling and climate change: Although global balancing of carbon dioxide is more complex, in the short term some marine microbes trap it, while soil microorganisms release it
AB  - Microorganisms can act as buffers against increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, slowing but not altogether halting climate change. Oceans sequester approximately 25% of human-generated carbon dioxide through physiochemical and biological processes, with the Southern Ocean responsible for absorbing the lionâ€™s share of this total. On land, permafrost is by far the largest store of carbon compounds, where the initial impact of thawing is to release carbon dioxide via microbial decomposition. Prairie grasslands are another essential piece of the carbon cycle puzzle and here, too, initial releases of carbon tend to be followed by periods of stability, leaving uncertainties about long-term effects.

TI  - Impact of algae biofuel on in-use gaseous and particulate emissions from a marine vessel
AB  - In-use emission rates for a marine vessel operating on hydrotreated algae biofuel are reported for the first time. Emission measurements were made on a four-stroke marine diesel engine from a Stalwart class vessel to compare the emission profile from burning ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) to a 50:50 blend of ULSD and algae biofuel (A50). In-use emission measurements followed the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 8178-4 D2 certification test cycle protocol. Particulate matter (PM 2.5), nitrogen oxides (NO x), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO 2) were sampled in accordance with the ISO 8178-2 protocol for each mode of the test cycle. Switching fuel from ULSD to A50 resulted in significant âˆ¼35% lower PM 2.5 emissions for 25 and 50% load and an overall weighted PM 2.5 reduction of âˆ¼25%. Overall reductions of 30 and 20% were observed in elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC), respectively. PM 2.5 was dominated by OC (77-94%) for both fuels. NO x emissions were reduced by âˆ¼10% on switching from ULSD to A50. Overall, the emissions of CO 2 and CO were reduced by 5 and 18%, indicating a slight improvement in fuel economy for this engine while operating on A50. Â© 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The green technologies in an urgent attempt to alleviate fossil fuel usage and CO2 emissions, fuels, heat or electricity must be produced from biological sources by nanotechnology which is economic, energetically efficient, environmentally friendly and not competitive with food production due to unsustain of the current fossil fuel usage and its successive greenhouse gas production. Therefore, nanotechnologies in bioenergy suitable to the friendly environment are marked aim to provide the vital information about the growing field for green energy to minimize the potential environmental risks. It is pointed out that the significantly feasible worldâ€™s eco-energy for the foreseeable future should not only be realized, but also methods for using the current energy and their by-products more efficiently should be found correspondingly, alongside technologies that will ensure minimal environmental impact.

TI  - Continuous production of biodiesel from microalgae by extraction coupling with transesterification under supercritical conditions
AB  - Raw material for biodiesel has been expanded from edible oil to non-edible oil. In this study, biodiesel continuous production for two kinds of microalgae Chrysophyta and Chlorella sp. was conducted. Coupling with the supercritical carbon dioxide extraction, the oil of microalgae was extracted firstly, and then sent to the downstream production of biodiesel. The residue after decompression can be reused as the material for pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals. Results showed that the particle size of microalgae, temperature, pressure, molar ration of methanol to oil, flow of CO2 and n-hexane all have effects on the yield of biodiesel. With the optimal operation conditions: 40 mesh algae, extraction temperature 60 degrees C, flow of n-hexane 0.4 ml/min, reaction temperature: 340 degrees C, pressure: 18-20 MPa, CO2 flow of 0.5 L/min, molar ration of methanol to oil 84: 1, a yield of 56.31\% was obtained for Chrysophyta, and 63.78\% for Chlorella sp. due to the higher lipid content.

TI  - Assessing the contribution of mangrove carbon and of other basal sources to intertidal flats adjacent to one of the largest West African mangrove forests
AB  - Mangrove forests are productive habitats and major potential exporters of organic matter and nutrients to adjacent habitats. Here we examine the extent to which mangrove carbon is transferred to adjacent intertidal food webs in the second largest mangrove-covered area in Africa, in Guinea-Bissau. Applying stable isotope analysis and mixing models, we made comparisons at two spatial scales: (1) a large scale, comparing intertidal flats with (mangrove sites) and without (control sites) adjacent mangrove forests regarding the carbon isotopic signature of macrozoobenthos and sediment organic matter (SOM), and the relative importance of potential primary food sources in sustaining macrozoobenthos, and (2) a fine scale, performing stable carbon isotope measurements along 200 m transects from the coastline out to open intertidal flats, to trace mangrove carbon in macrozoobenthos and in the SOM. We found no evidence that mangrove carbon sustains intertidal food webs, despite SOM being significantly more depleted in 13C in mangrove sites. Mangrove leaves had the lowest relative contribution to the diet of macrozoobenthos, while macroalgae, benthic microalgae and POM showed variable but overall relevant contributions. Yet, at a smaller scale, mangrove carbon was detectable in SOM and in most macrozoobenthos, being strongest within 50 m of the mangrove edge and quickly fading with increasing distance. Our results suggest that there is only a marginal input of mangrove carbon into the food webs of unvegetated intertidal flats. Still, this leaves open the possibility of mangrove forests acting as sources of dissolved inorganic carbon and processed nitrogen, which can be assimilated by the algae and subsequently fuel adjacent food webs.

TI  - We Must Stop Fossil Fuel Emissions to Protect Permafrost Ecosystems
AB  - Climate change is an existential threat to the vast global permafrost domain. The diverse human cultures, ecological communities, and biogeochemical cycles of this tenth of the planet depend on the persistence of frozen conditions. The complexity, immensity, and remoteness of permafrost ecosystems make it difficult to grasp how quickly things are changing and what can be done about it. Here, we summarize terrestrial and marine changes in the permafrost domain with an eye toward global policy. While many questions remain, we know that continued fossil fuel burning is incompatible with the continued existence of the permafrost domain as we know it. If we fail to protect permafrost ecosystems, the consequences for human rights, biosphere integrity, and global climate will be severe. The policy implications are clear: the faster we reduce human emissions and draw down atmospheric CO2, the more of the permafrost domain we can save. Emissions reduction targets must be strengthened and accompanied by support for local peoples to protect intact ecological communities and natural carbon sinks within the permafrost domain. Some proposed geoengineering interventions such as solar shading, surface albedo modification, and vegetation manipulations are unproven and may exacerbate environmental injustice without providing lasting protection. Conversely, astounding advances in renewable energy have reopened viable pathways to halve human greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and effectively stop them well before 2050. We call on leaders, corporations, researchers, and citizens everywhere to acknowledge the global importance of the permafrost domain and work towards climate restoration and empowerment of Indigenous and immigrant communities in these regions.

TI  - THE RISKS OF USING RENEWABLE ENERGIES
AB  - The use of fossil fuels, which supply the needs of modern humanity, pollutes our atmosphere with more and more CO(2), speeding up the greenhouse effect, heating the Earth and generating global changes in our climate. The consequences of this are not known, although we have been given a few scenarios about our future, from the rising of the level of oceans to a new ice age. If the average temperature continuously rises, then the icecaps will melt and the level of the oceans will rise. As 60\% of humanity lives on or near the coast, this will cause serious problems. According to another theory, the enormous mass of freshwater from ice melt will attenuate the salt water of the Gulf Stream and interrupt its flow, which can cause a new ice age in Europe. Anyway, what is sure is that we have started an irreversible process, we must be aware of its consequences and, if possible, we must try to stall it. One possible way to do so is to lower our CO(2) emissions, for example, through the use of renewable energies. Sources of renewable energy include wind, solar and hydro energy and biomass. Using these sources of energy, we can lessen our greenhouse gas emissions. But, of course, this has two sides. Using renewable energy presents plenty of dangers. I try to focus my attention on these dangers in my study. For the use of hydropower we must build dams and aquifers, which can influence another country's water supply, thereby potentially causing conflicts. The use of biomass can also be dangerous. First of all, the mass of green stock can displace food crops and can cause starvation; the cutting and parching of the Brazilian rainforest for growing green stock will have more environmental consequences. These are only two of the problems, dangers and challenges I explain in my study.

TI  - Examining the capacity for cultivating marine macroalgae using process liquids from biogas digestate as nutrient source and cultivation medium
AB  - The land-based and seawater-independent production of macroalgae as a source of renewable biomass with a multitude of potential applications increasingly attracts the attention of science and industry. However, the availability of a feasible nutrient source acceptable for supplying a large-scale cultivation facility on land remains a persisting obstacle that has not yet been overcome. Hence, this study aimed to test an uncomplicated technological approach to sufficiently reduce the nutrient load of the biogas digestate and to identify an optimal ratio of pretreated digestate to volume of cultivation medium. Based on an initial solid-liquid separation of biogas digestate, the liquid phase was treated with flocculation agent and fine separation (liquid A), followed by filtration through an organic sorption filter (liquid B) and finally through a high-performance soil filter (liquid C). The results showed notable differences regarding the nutritional value of the different process liquids. The mixtures of process liquids A to C with artificial seawater (ASW) optimal for biomass increase were 1:50, 1:10 and 1:1, respectively. Maximum biomass increase was achieved by using a mixture of process liquid A and ASW with the ratio 1:50, which resulted in a growth rate of 7.02\% FW d(-1) in comparison to a growth rate of 5.71\% FW d(-1) of the untreated control group that used f/2-standard nutrient supply. Regarding the attempt of using a maximum amount of digestate and of reducing the necessity of diluting the process liquid with ASW, process liquid C with a mixing ratio of 1:1 appeared promising for a large-scale land-based cultivation of marine macroalgae. However, the transfer of the data to other agricultural biogas plants needs to be adapted to the respective case as changing feeding strategies of the biogas fermenters with different biogas substrates might lead to a large variation of nutrients in the biogas digestate resulting in changing quality and quantity of nutrients in the produced process liquids.

TI  - Spatial distribution of an invasive plant Spartina alterniflora and its potential as biofuels in China
AB  - Spartina alterniflora, an invasive plant, has caused enormous ecological consequences since it was introduced to China over 30 years ago. However, as a potential bioenergy plant, it has obvious advantages. Therefore, it is academically important to study its spatial distribution and bioenergy potentials. The present research, using the remote sensing data from China and Brazil earth resources satellite (CBERS), coupled with data from related literature, concludes that the total area covered by the herb in China reaches 34,178ha, mainly in eastern Jiangsu Province, Shanghai Municipality and Zhejiang Province, accounting for 94.22% of the country's total. Its total annual biomass reaches 2.53Mt, producing 39 PJ bioenergy, equivalent to that of 1.33Mt of standard coal. The annual biomass of its above-ground parts is 1.12Mt, producing 18 PJ bioenergy, equivalent to that of 0.61Mt of standard coal. Besides, it also has strong carbon sequestration capabilities, its annual C stock amounting to 1.16Mt, or 4.25Mt of CO2. Therefore it is very significant for the carbon cycle of the ocean ecosystem.

TI  - GREENER METHANOL SUPPLY TO MEET RISING SHIPPING DEMAND
AB  - Green methanol is establishing itself as a contender in the 2050 bunker fuel market, with the chemical industry motivated to go green and new production facilities and new ships raising optimism around the world. Methanol provides considerable retrofit potential as an IMO compliant bunker, being very close to a drop-in fuel for most 2 or 4-stroke marine engines. As such, some vessels may be cost effectively repurposed, extending their useful lives in the process. By 2050, there could be 135 metric ton (Mt) of methanol produced from biomass, 250 Mt produced from green hydrogen, and captured CO2, and 115 Mt from fossil fuels. Demand from land and marine transport will be a key driver for the production of renewable methanol due to increasing regulation of GHG emissions. Methanex, the world's largest producer of methanol, is currently involved in a number of green methanol initiatives including in Iceland where the company has invested in Carbon Recycling International. A study led by the University of the West Indies found that both pyrolysis and auto-thermal reforming (ATR) were the premiere climate-smart choices for production when based on circular CO2 utilization and storage. ATR proved to be the least energy demanding technology, mainly due to the high energy recovery from the partial oxidation that powers the reformation. Methanol is already available in around 100 ports around the world and is being used on around 20 large ships. Waterfront Shipping Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Methanex, has announced eight new methanol fueled dualfuel ships to be built at Hyundai Mipo Dockyard and delivered between 2021 and 2023 in partnership with Marinvest, NYK, Meiji Shipping, KSS Line and Mitsui O.S.K.

TI  - Effects and recovery of larvae of the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa (Desmophyllum pertusum) exposed to suspended bentonite, barite and drill cuttings
AB  - Fossil fuel drilling operations create sediment plumes and release waste materials into the ocean. These operations sometimes occur close to sensitive marine ecosystems, such as cold-water corals. While there have been several studies on the effects of energy industry activities on adult corals, there is very little information on potential impacts to their early life history stages. Larval stages of many marine organisms, including cold-water corals use cilia as a means of feeding and swimming, and if these structures become clogged with suspended particulates, the larvae may sink and be lost to the system. The objective of this study was to understand the response of Lophelia pertusa larvae to a different drilling waste components, and assess post-exposure recovery. Larvae of two ages (eight and 21 days) were exposed to a range of concentrations of bentonite, barite and drill cuttings. Larval sensitivity was assessed using the concentration at which 50% of the larvae showed behavioral effects (EC50) or lethal effects (LC50). Larvae showed greatest sensitivity to bentonite, followed by barite and drill cuttings, and also showed age-related responses that differed among the test materials. Post exposure recovery was variable across materials, with larvae exposed to bentonite having the lowest recovery rates. Understanding the vulnerability of early life history stages to human activities can help inform management strategies to preserve reproductive capacity of important marine ecosystems.

TI  - High risk of abrupt climate change requiring closely estimate biofuel greenhouse gas emissions by life cycle assessment
AB  - The article focuses on a specific environmental evaluation method - Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and it estimates biofuel greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and compares to fossil fuels. It is mainly evaluated by the mean Global Warming impact indicator, expressed in grams of CO2 equivalent per MJ of energy (gCO2eqÂ·MJ-1). Biofuels are highly relevant renewable energy options on a global scale. Comparing with fossil fuels, biofuels in some cases can be carbon neutral or even carbon negative and play an important role in the reduction of GHG emissions. A number of LCA have shown that first generation biofuels provide a little to no benefit for GHG reductions compared to fossil fuels, particularly when indirect effects are considered. LCAs of second and third generation biofuels exhibit great variability and uncertainty but are intended to achieve greater GHG reductions. Highly possible Arctic Ocean ice meltdown in the late summer as soon as in September 2015 and accelerated methane hydrate destabilization in the Arctic Ocean seabed via ocean warming could cause abrupt climate change in the following decade. Mitigation of climate change requires to use only biofuels with the global warming impact indicator close to 0 gCO2eqÂ·MJ-1 (Carbon Neutral) or - gCO2eqÂ·MJ-1 (Carbon Negative).

TI  - What evidence exists on the local impacts of energy systems on marine ecosystem services: a systematic map
AB  - Background: Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere and its impact on the climate are a pressing concern for governments around the world. Reducing GHG emissions by changing the energy production mix is one option to reach targets being set by international communities. As the implementation of renewable and non-renewable energy infrastructure deployed in marine ecosystems increases, it is not clear how these changes will impact on the marine environment and the ecosystem services it provides. To address this knowledge gap a systematic mapping approach was applied, with three key aims: firstly, to provide an overview of the types of impacts being studied for the offshore components of nuclear, offshore oil \& gas and offshore wind arrays; secondly to demonstrate how these impacts can be translated into ecosystem services; and finally to provide a searchable database of the results. Methods: Searches for relevant articles were carried out using academic and grey literature databases. A total of 2297 articles were sourced, which were screened using selection criteria that determined which subject populations, exposure types and outcomes were considered relevant. To translate these findings into ecosystem service impacts, the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) and Millennium Ecosystem Assessment frameworks were used to ensure relevance, transparency and replicability. Results: A total of 50 articles, which equated to 208 studies, spanning four decades since 1970, were selected and coded for the systematic map. Across all energy systems, benthic species were the most studied group. Following this, results then varied by group; marine birds and fish were most prevalent in studies of offshore wind; fish for offshore oil \& gas studies; and pelagic organisms for nuclear. The outcome variables most investigated were changes in population and ecosystem function/process. Of all the ecosystem services associated with the studied impacts, regulating services were investigated most often, due to the large number of studies on benthic organisms. Cultural services, specific to offshore wind, were also prevalent. Discussion: The systematic map provides a searchable database of articles and their relevant studies on the local ecological impacts of marine renewable energies. It has identified a number of potential future areas for primary research; for example, investigating the impacts of decommissioning offshore energy infrastructure on marine habitats and organisms.

TI  - Novel macroalgae (seaweed) biorefinery systems for integrated chemical, protein, salt, nutrient and mineral extractions and environmental protection by green synthesis and life cycle sustainability assessments
AB  - Highly efficient macroalgae based chemical factories and environmental protection have been comprehensively studied for the first time to displace fossil resources to mitigate climate change impact. Wild macroalgae by (bio)phytoremediation and residual macroalgae by biosorption can be used to treat wastewaters, marine environment, soil and sludge. Cultured macroalgae can be processed through drying, milling, grinding, suspension in deionised water and filtration extracting sap of heavy metals; centrifugation of solids recovering nutrients; ion exchange resins of supernatants separating protein and polysaccharides; dialysis purifying protein from salts and pretreatment of polysaccharides producing a sugar platform. Protein profiling shows the presence of the essential amino acids as well as others as food additive, flavour enhancer and pharmaceutical ingredient. Sugars can be converted into a chemical: levulinic acid by controlled acid hydrolysis; 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid by heterogeneous catalytic reaction; succinic acid by tricarboxylic acid cycle; lactic acid by fermentation, with 3-5 times market value than bioethanol. Protein, sugar based chemical and inorganics give the highest to the lowest climate change impact savings of 12, 3 and 1 kg CO2 equivalent per kg product. Their cost of production is estimated at \$2010 t(-1), significantly lower than their market prices, making the integrated marine biorefinery system economically more attractive than lignocellulosic terrestrial biorefinery systems. Social life cycle assessment indicates that the highest to the lowest avoided social impacts will be from the displacements of animal based protein, sugars and minerals, in Indonesia, China and Philippines (producing 27 million tonnes per annum, 93\% of global production).

TI  - Mangrove microbiome reveals importance of sulfur metabolism in tropical coastal waters
AB  - Mangroves under macro-tidal regimes are global carbon sequestration hotspots but the microbial drivers of biogeochemical cycles remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the drivers of mangrove microbial community composition across a porewater-creek-estuary-ocean continuum. Observations were performed on the Amazon region in one of the largest mangrove systems worldwide with effective sequestration of organic carbon buried in soils and dissolved carbon via outwelling to the ocean. The potential export to the adjacent oceanic region ranged from 57 to 380 kg of dissolved and particulate organic carbon per second (up to 33 thousand tons C per day). Macro tides modulated microbial communities and their metabolic processes, e.g., anoxygenic phototrophy, sulfur, and nitrogen cycling. Respiration, sulfur metabolism and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels were linked to functional groups and microbial cell counts. Total microbial counts decreased and cyanobacteria counts peaked in the spring tide. The microbial groups driving carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and methane cycles were consistent across all spatial scales. Taxonomic groups engaged in sulfur cycling (Allochromatium, Desulfovibrio, and Thibacillus) within mangroves were abundant at all scales. Tidally-driven porewater exchange within mangroves drove a progressive increase of sulfur cycle taxonomic groups and their functional genes both temporally (tidal cycles) and spatially (from mangrove porewater to continental shelf). Overall, we revealed a unified and consistent response of microbiomes at different spatial and temporal scales to tidally-driven mangrove porewater exchange. Â© 2021

TI  - Wave Energy in Tropical Regions: Deployment Challenges, Environmental and Social Perspectives
AB  - The harnessing of renewable sources of marine energy has become a promising solution for a number of problems, namely satisfying the increasing demand for electricity, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and the provision of energy to regions unconnected to a national grid. Tropical countries have an interesting dichotomy: Despite their varied potential sources of marine energy, their environmental and social conditions impose severe constraints on the development of a renewable energy industry. Moreover, the exploitation of these opportunities is limited by national economies' reliance on fossil fuels, political and social restraints, and technological immaturity. The present work addresses challenges and opportunities common to wave energy implementation in tropical nations, as a first approach to a regional diagnosis. The motivation for this work is to encourage research on wave energy policies in the Tropics. Technical, environmental, and social challenges to be overcome in wave energy projects are discussed. The technical challenges are grouped into development, deployment, and operation stages of wave energy converters; environmental challenges are divided into biodiversity, cumulative effects, and monitoring aspects, whilst social issues include population growth and energy access matters. The Mexican strategy for developing sustainable technology throughout the wave energy production chain is also presented.

TI  - Renewable sources in India and their applications
AB  - India holds seventh largest share of land and second largest share of human population on the earth. Unique geographical location and bountiful natural resources that have once made India the cradle of human civilisation have been redefined as renewable resources in the wake of fast depleting fossils and impending doom of global warming. Moreover, as the issue of sustainability rises up every now and then, India seeks to find solution in its veteran trusted resources, the sun, the wind, the oceans and flora-fauna, yet following a well-defined strategic trajectory. Due to consistent endeavours and strong policy support, currently, India is amongst top six countries of the world, in terms of highest renewable additions in the past decade, fifth in terms of wind power generation and second largest biogas consumer in the world. Further, a bundle of programmes to promote renewable energy, viz., Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM), National Biomass Cookstoves Initiative (NBCI), National Biogas and Manure Management Programme (NBMMP), Village Energy Security Programme (VESP), Remote Village Electrification Programme (RVEP) and National Hydrogen Energy Programme (NHEP), are being implemented countrywide. Adding one more feather in its cap, recently, India launched its much awaited offshore wind policy. This chapter tries to investigate the renewable energy potential of the country, existing technologies, policies and programmes and finally brings out prospects and challenges of renewable energy for the country.

TI  - About how to capture and exploit the CO2 surplus that nature, per se, is not capable of fixing
AB  - Human activity has been altering many ecological cycles for decades, disturbing the natural mechanisms which are responsible for re-establishing the normal environmental balances. Probably, the most disrupted of these cycles is the cycle of carbon. In this context, many technologies have been developed for an efficient CO2 removal from the atmosphere. Once captured, it could be stored in large geological formations and other reservoirs like oceans. This strategy could present some environmental and economic problems. Alternately, CO2 can be transformed into carbonates or different added-value products, such as biofuels and bioplastics, recycling CO2 from fossil fuel. Currently different methods are being studied in this field. We classified them into biological, inorganic and hybrid systems for CO2 transformation. To be environmentally compatible, they should be powered by renewable energy sources. Although hybrid systems are still incipient technologies, they have made great advances in the recent years. In this scenario, biotechnology is the spearhead of ambitious strategies to capture CO2 and reduce global warming. Â© 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Energy direct inputs and greenhouse gas emissions of the main industrial trawl fishery of Brazil
AB  - This study provides first-time estimates of direct fuel inputs and greenhouse gas emissions produced by the trawl fishing fleet operating off southeastern and southern Brazil. Analyzed data comprised vessel characteristics, landings, fishing areas and trawling duration of 10,144 fishing operations monitored in Santa Catarina State from 2003 to 2011. Three main fishing strategies were differentiated: 'shrimp trawling', 'slope trawling' and 'pair trawling'. Jointly these operations burned over 141.5 million l of diesel to land 342.3 million kg of fish and shellfish. Annually, 0.36-0.48 l were consumed for every kg of catch landed. Because all fishing strategies relied on multispecific catches to raise total incomes, estimates of fuel use intensity were generally low but increased 316-1025% if only nominal targets were considered. In nine years, trawling operations emitted 104.07 GgC to the atmosphere, between 36,800-49,500 tons CO2 per year. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Bioleaching of heavy metals from harbor sediment using sulfur-oxidizing microflora acclimated from native sediment and exogenous soil
AB  - The harbor sediment containing high concentration of heavy metals may pose serious impacts on the marine ecosystem and environmental quality. The bioleaching process has been considered as an environmentally friendly and cost-effective alternative for removing heavy metals from contaminated sediments. In this study, a series of experiments were performed to investigate the feasibility of bioleaching process for removing heavy metals from the contaminated harbor sediments. The performance of the bioleaching process inoculated with sulfur-oxidizing microflora acclimated from the native harbor sediment was compared with that acclimated from the exogenous soil. In the bioleaching experiment with inoculants from native sediment, the efficiency of Zn, Cu, Cr, Pb, and Ni (30Â days) reached 39â€“100%, 21â€“94%, 8â€“63%, 5â€“74%, and 19â€“77%, respectively. While 59â€“100% of Zn, 22â€“100% of Cu, 0â€“95% of Cr, 0â€“100% of Pb, and 22â€“100% of Ni were respectively removed in the bioleaching experiment with inoculants from exogenous soil after 30Â days of reaction time. The results show that the rate and efficiency of metal removal in the bioleaching process decreased with an increase of sediment solid content from 10 to 40Â g/L. The efficiency of metal removal in the bioleaching process with inoculants from the native sediment was lower than those from the exogenous soil due to the bacterial activity. By the fractionation of metal in the harbor sediment, exchangeable, carbonate-bound, and Fe/Mn oxide-bound metals (mobile fractions) were found to be apparently reduced and even organic matter/sulfide-bound and residual metals (stable fractions) were slightly removed after the bioleaching experiment.

TI  - Review on Sustainability of Renewable Energy In India
AB  - Reliable and sustainable energy supply is fundamental to the economic and social fabric of nations, and to the well-being and quality of life for their citizens. Major power generation in India is carried out by conventional energy sources, coal and mineral oil-based power plants which contribute heavily to greenhouse gases emission. India has a vast supply of renewable energy resources, and it has one of the largest programs in the world for deploying renewable energy products and systems. Renewable energy is a clean and sustainable source of energy derived from nature and it has potential to provide solutions to the venerable energy problems being faced by the developing countries like India. To overcome energy shortage in India the renewable energy sources like wind energy, solar energy, geothermal energy, ocean energy, biomass energy and fuel cell technology can be used. Indeed, it is the only country in the world to have an exclusive ministry for renewable energy development, the Ministry of Non-Conventional Energy Sources (MNES).This paper reviews the renewable energy scenario of India. It begins by describing the importance of renewable energy and its advantages over fossil fuels. It gives an overview of the renewable energies in India while evaluating the current status and the deployment of each of these technologies to date in India.

TI  - Localized effects of offshore aquaculture on water quality in a tropical sea
AB  - Aquaculture production has increased steadily in many tropical countries over the past few decades, although impact assessments have been frequently neglected. We investigated the impacts of an offshore barramundi fish farm on water quality in the southern-central Red Sea, a traditionally understudied tropical, oligotrophic, and semi-enclosed basin. Inorganic nutrients, particulate matter, chlorophyll-a, and heterotrophic bacteria were measured periodically over 8 months around the farm. Water down-current from the farm had, on average, more heterotrophic bacteria and chlorophyll-a than up-current (11% and 34% higher, respectively). Ratios of dissolved inorganic nitrogen:phosphorus down-current from the farm were lower than ratios up-current (mean 9.8 vs 16.0, respectively). Phosphate, inorganic nitrogen, and particulate matter showed patterns of enrichment associated with the farm after a fish feeding event. Strategies such as feed optimization and considering hydrodynamics in site selection may improve water quality for future fish farms in Saudi Arabia and other tropical countries. Â© 2021

TI  - The effects of offshore petroleum exploitation on microbial community and antibiotic resistome of adjacent marine sediments
AB  - The exploitation of petroleum in offshore areas is becoming more prosperous due to the increasing human demand for oil. However, the effects of offshore petroleum exploitation on the microbial community in the surrounding environment are still not fully understood. to address this concern, variations in the composition, function, and antibiotic resistance of the microbial community in marine sediments adjacent to an offshore petroleum exploitation platform were investigated using a metagenomics-based method. Significant shifts in the microbial community composition were noted in sediments impacted by offshore petroleum exploitation. Nitrosopumilales was enriched in marine sediments with the offshore petroleum exploitation activities compared to the control sediments. Also, the abundances of function genes involved in carbon, butanoate, methane, and fatty acid metabolism in sediment microbial communities increased due to the offshore petroleum exploitation. Offshore petroleum exploitation led to the propagation of some antibiotic resistance genes (ARG), including a multidrug transporter, smeE, and arnA, in marine sediments via horizontal gene transfer mediated by class I integrons. The total abundance and diversity of ARG in marine sediments, however, were insignificantly impacted by offshore petroleum exploitation.

TI  - Bioprospecting for acidophilic lipid-rich green microalgae isolated from abandoned mine site water bodies
AB  - With fossil fuel sources in limited supply, microalgae show tremendous promise as a carbon neutral source of biofuel. Current microalgae biofuel strategies typically rely on growing high-lipid producing laboratory strains of microalgae in open raceways or closed system photobioreactors. Unfortunately, these microalgae species are found to be sensitive to environmental stresses or competition by regional strains. Contamination by invasive species can diminish productivity of commercial algal processes. A potential improvement to current strategies is to identify high-lipid producing microalgae, which thrive in selected culture conditions that reduce the risk of contamination, such as low pH. Here we report the identification of a novel high-lipid producing microalgae which can tolerate low pH growth conditions. Lig 290 is a Scenedesmus spp. isolated from a low pH waterbody (pH = 4.5) in proximity to an abandoned lignite mine in Northern Ontario, Canada. Compared to a laboratory strain of Scendesmus dimorphus, Lig 290 demonstrated robust growth rates, a strong growth profile, and high lipid production. As a consequence, Lig 290 may have potential application as a robust microalgal species for use in biofuel production.

TI  - Green thermodynamics
AB  - Green engineering is defined as the design, commercialization, and use of processes and products that are feasible and economical while reducing the generation of pollution at the source and minimizing the risk to human health and the environment. Green engineering promotes sustainability in all engineering disciplines and practices, and incorporates development and implementation of technologically and economically viable products while adhering to the principles of green engineering. Green thermodynamics is a subcategory of green engineering related to energy. In thermodynamics, the concept of green can be associated with an energy source, an energy interaction or transfer, and energy conversion or use. An energy source that can be extracted and brought into a useful form with minimal adverse impact on the environment and the future supplies can be viewed as green. With this definition, clean, renewable and sustainable energies like solar, wind, geothermal, tidal, wave, and ocean thermal energies are green energies, but fossil fuels are not. Some forms of bioenergy that involve combustion are not quite green since it is renewable and sustainable, but not clean. Exergy destruction associated with energy transfer and energy conversion, and adverse effects on human health and the environment are measures of deviation from thermodynamic greenness. The starting point for making the incorporation of green engineering widespread in real-world engineering practice is education, and engineering courses should start incorporating green components. In this paper, green components of thermodynamics are identified, general aspects of green practices associated with thermodynamics are discussed, their impacts are assessed, and examples are presented. Extensions to other related areas of green engineering practices are made. It is hoped that this presentation will attract the attention to green aspects of thermodynamics, and will accelerate the generation, dissemination, and utilization of green ideas and practices.

TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic iron oxidizers together drive denitrification and carbon cycling at marine iron-rich hydrothermal vents
AB  - In principle, iron oxidation can fuel significant primary productivity and nutrient cycling in dark environments such as the deep sea. However, we have an extremely limited understanding of the ecology of iron-based ecosystems, and thus the linkages between iron oxidation, carbon cycling, and nitrate reduction. Here we investigate iron microbial mats from hydrothermal vents at LoModified Letter Turned Commaihi Seamount, HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, using genome-resolved metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to reconstruct potential microbial roles and interactions. Our results show that the aerobic iron-oxidizing Zetaproteobacteria are the primary producers, concentrated at the oxic mat surface. Their fixed carbon supports heterotrophs deeper in the mat, notably the second most abundant organism, Candidatus Ferristratum sp. (uncultivated gen. nov.) from the uncharacterized DTB120 phylum. Candidatus Ferristratum sp., described using nine high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes with similar distributions of genes, expressed nitrate reduction genes narGH and the iron oxidation gene cyc2 in situ and in response to Fe(II) in a shipboard incubation, suggesting it is an anaerobic nitrate-reducing iron oxidizer. Candidatus Ferristratum sp. lacks a full denitrification pathway, relying on Zetaproteobacteria to remove intermediates like nitrite. Thus, at LoModified Letter Turned Commaihi, anaerobic iron oxidizers coexist with and are dependent on aerobic iron oxidizers. In total, our work shows how key community members work together to connect iron oxidation with carbon and nitrogen cycling, thus driving the biogeochemistry of exported fluids.

TI  - OTEC - Power systems
AB  - The development of power systems is a key part of the Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) program. The power system development centers on two sets of contracts designated as: PSD-I and PSD-II. These contracts are directed towards: the design of an OTEC power module, the fabrication of a test article for an ocean going test on OTEC-I, and the fabrication of a 10MWe (net) power system. PSD-I was a set of three contracts with: Lockheed, TRW, and Westinghouse. They have completed the preliminary design phase of the power module in December 1978. From these three, Westinghouse was selected to fabricate test heat exchangers for OTEC-I. The PSD-I designs feature the use of shell-and-tube heat exchangers. The PSD-II program was planned to explore the possibility of lower cost power systems through the use of shell-less (or non-shell-and-tube) heat exchangers. Three contractors: General Electric with Sea Solar Power, Lockheed with Alfa-Laval, and TRW with Linde, have been selected to perform the conceptual and preliminary design phases of PSD-II. This paper will present an up to date description of the technical features of each of these design studies. Included will be: heat exchanger design, biofouling control, rotating equipment, auxiliaries, plant layout, and system cost. This paper will also discuss the role of the power systems development program in the larger OTEC program. Copyright Â©1979. Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Relationships among vegetation types, biomass and soil environmental factors in the wetlands of yellow sea and Bohai coastal areas
AB  - Understanding the relationships among wetland types, biomass and environmental factors is fundamental for wetland vegetation restoration. Based on field investigation in coastal areas of Yellow Sea and Bohai, TWINSPAN was used to categorize wetland types, and redundancy analysis was used to determine the major environmental factors affecting the spatial distribution and biomass variation of wetland types, aiming to provide scientific basis for wetland restoration. Results showed that wetland vegetation in coastal areas of Yellow Sea and Bohai could be classified into eleven types. Soil total carbon content and electrical conductivity significantly influenced the spatial distribution of wetland types. The wetlands in coastal areas of yellow Sea and Bohai had high biomass, with the highest (48512 kgÂ·hm-2) occurring in Spartina alterniflora community, followed by Suaeda salsa, Phragmites australis, and Tamarix chinensis communities (&gt;5000 kgÂ·hm-2), and the lower (&lt;5000 kgÂ·hm-2) in other communities. Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen contents were the major factors influencing the spatial variation of wetland biomass. Under climatic warming and increased nitrogen deposition, the biomass of wetland vegetation can be enhanced. Therefore, it is an effective way to strengthen wetland conservation and to restore the degraded wetland ecosystems for enhancing coastal wetland carbon sink and coping with climatic change.

Triple I light (III light), which is calculated based on ecological footprint, bio-capacity, cost and benefit, was introduced to evaluate the economic together with environmental impacts. The assessment results for an assumed scenario suggested the sustainability of the conceptual system. The environmental effect and the economic impact played almost the same role in the assessment results. In the meanwhile, the non energy production dominated the system performance.

TI  - Infomar data supports offshore energy development and marine spatial planning in the irish offshore via the emodnet geology portal
AB  - The characterization of the seafloor is a fundamental first step in informing resource management, marine spatial planning, conservation, fisheries, industry and research. Integrated Mapping for the Sustainable Development of Irelandâ€™s Marine Resource (INFOMAR), Irelandâ€™s national seabed mapping programme, delivers freely available, high-resolution seabed imagery derived from multibeam echosounder data in the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone. The European Union established the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) Geology data portal, which provides harmonized broad-scale seabed substrate information for all European seas and confidence assessments of the information that underpins the geological interpretations. A multi-scale product has been produced using INFOMARâ€™s high-resolution seabed substrate information at the 1:50 000 scale. As part of the Supporting Implementation of Maritime Spatial Planning in the Celtic Seas project, the EMODnet Geology seabed substrate data portal assisted in addressing the challenges associated with the implementation of the European Unionâ€™s Marine Spatial Planning Directive. The seabed substrate data in the EMODnet Geology data portal were identified as a valuable tool for guiding the selection of sites for offshore wind farms in the Irish Sea and their subsequent characterization. This paper outlines the approach to delivering a multi-scale seabed substrate dataset for the Irish offshore and its applicability to marine spatial planning and the development of offshore energy resources.

TI  - Synthesis of Biodiesel from the Oily Content of Marine Green Alga Ulva fasciata
AB  - The present study is focused on the chemical transformation of oils derived from the marine green alga Ulva fasciata Delile to biodiesel. The transesterification of algal oil was performed with a variety of alcohols using Na metal and NaOH as catalysts. Transesterification of algal oil by mechanical stirring yielded significant biodiesel within an hour at 60 degrees C with NaOH and at room temperature with Na metal. In addition, microwave irradiated transesterification produced significant amount of biodiesel with NaOH and Na metal within 1-5 minutes. However, reaction of sodium metal in microwave oven was highly exothermic and uncontrollable that could also damage the radiation source. The reactivity order of alcohols was found to be methanol > ethanol > benzyl alcohol > 1-propanol > 1-butanol > 1-pentanol > 1-hexanol > 2-propanol. Isopropyl alcohol was found to be least reactive due to steric hindrance. Benzyl alcohol was found to be more reactive than 1-propyl alcohol due to the electron withdrawing effect of benzene ring. The highest \% conversion of FAME and FAEE were found to be 97\% and 98\% respectively using Na metal through mechanical stirring. Biodiesel production was confirmed by thin layer chromatography (TLC). Furthermore, the fuel properties including density, kinematics viscosity, high heating value, acid value, free fatty acid (\%), cloud point and pour point of U. fasciata oil and all the esters were determined and compared with the standard limits of biodiesel. Fatty acid methyl, ethyl, 1-propyl, 2-propyl, 1-butyl, 1-pentyl and 1-hexyl esters showed the fuel properties within the biodiesel standard limits therefore all of them were considered as the substitute of biodiesel. On the other hand, the fuel properties of benzyl ester were found to be above the limits of biodiesel specifications and thus it could not be considered as biodiesel. This research article will be helpful to overcome the current challenges of energy crisis, global warming and environmental pollution.

TI  - A strategy for advanced biofuel production and emission utilization from macroalgal biorefinery using superstructure optimization
AB  - The rapid increase in the emission of greenhouse gases over the years signifies the urgent need to explore fuels that emit less CO2, such as biofuels. CO2 emission can be reduced further by productively utilizing the CO2 generated during industrial processes. In this study, we have proposed a strategy to produce advanced biofuel from macroalgal biorefinery and to utilize all waste streams from processing into value-added products. To achieve this aim, we developed a novel superstructure for biorefinery process synthesis based on Saccharina japonica (macroalgae) to determine an optimal design of the biorefinery. Process integration was performed to utilize direct greenhouse gas emissions from the biorefinery and to reduce pollutant emissions and freshwater consumption. A techno-economic and environmental mixed-integer non-linear model was formulated based on this superstructure. To achieve the economic and environmental goals, two objective functions were studied: maximization of the net present value and minimization of CO2 emissions. A comprehensive sensitivity and Monte Carlo simulation model was formulated to evaluate the effects of variation in key model parameters on the overall economics and to perform the risk assessment, respectively. The minimum ethanol selling price range for the integrated design was found to be USD 0.36â€“0.56/L. The optimal design achieved a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions, from 4.86 kg/s to 0.42 kg/s, as well as a 38.6% reduction in freshwater consumption. The risk of the optimal design was found to be 20â€“44% on the basis of the minimum selling price of ethanol. Therefore, this design can be implemented as an economically and environmentally feasible approach to biofuel production. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Energy and exergy analyses of solar drying system of red seaweed
AB  - A solar drying system was designed, constructed and tested for drying of seaweed. Seaweed is a potential source of renewable energy, and it can be converted into energy such as biofuel oil, biodiesel and gas. Red seaweed was dried to the final moisture content of 10\% from 90\% w.b in 15 h. Drying kinetics of red seaweed were investigated and obtained. The nonlinear regression procedure was used to fit three different drying models. The Page's model clearly showed a better fit to the experimental data between Newton's model and Henderson and Pabis model. The Page's model was resulted in the highest value of R-2 and lowest values of MBE and RMSE. At average solar radiation of about 500 W/m(2) and air flow rate 0.05 kg/s, the collector, drying system and pick-up efficiencies were found about 35,27 and 95\%, respectively. This study was performed with energy analysis and exergy analyses of the solar drying process of red seaweed. The specific energy consumption (SEC) of 2.62 kWh/kg was obtained. Moreover, the exergy efficiency of solar drying ranged from 1\% to 93\%, with an average of 30\%. The values of improvement potential were found to be in the range of 0.3 and 630W, with an average of 247W. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Multi-use platforms at sea: A sustainable solution for aquaculture and biodiversity
AB  - Offshore management is a future challenge for the development of offshore renewable energy (ORE) industries and aquaculture because of the worldwide increase of demand for both industries. The synergetic development of marine renewable energy infrastructure with mariculture has been hypothesized as a way to share services and reduce costs. In the Irish Sea, blue mussels (Mytilus edulis L.) represent 40% to 50 % of the total gross turnover of Welsh shellfish industries. Also, the strong tidal currents (> 2m/s) occurring in North Wales, make this area an attractive place for the development of tidal renewable energy projects. A numerical approach has been developed using 2D hydrodynamic model (TELEMAC) coupled with particle tracking model (Matlab) to study connectivity between ORE and aquaculture sites. The study show that the location of ORE could potentially influence the connectivity between populations in the Irish Sea and so the importance to plan future multi-use platforms at sea location.

TI  - The influence of organic pollutant load and external resistance on the performance of a solid phase microbial fuel cell fed orange peel wastes
AB  - The degradation of organic matter in marine sediments could be taken advantage of to produce electricity by using a sediment microbial fuel cell (SMFC) inspired system. A single solid phase microbial fuel cell (SPMFC) in which orange peel wastes were supplemented as a carbon source mixed to marine sediments produced a power of 0.33 mW and a voltage of 0.7 V. By stacking multiple SPMFCs powers of 2.08 mW were generated for a voltage of 4.6 V. The use of dewatered sludge to inoculate the marine sediment improved the SPMFCs' performance. The removal of organic matter in the SPMFC system under closed circuit conditions was very interesting, removal rates were 19%â€“40% from readily oxidizable organic matter,15 to 35% for loss on ignition and 22%â€“55% for total organic carbon, indicating the possibility of using these systems to treat solid organic wastes and produce electricity at the same time.

TI  - Environmental assessment of marine fuels: Liquefied natural gas, liquefied biogas, methanol and bio-methanol
AB  - The combined effort of reducing the emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and greenhouse gases to comply with future regulations and reduce impact on climate change will require a significant change in ship propulsion. One alternative is to change fuels. In this study we compare the life cycle environmental performance of liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied biogas (LBG), methanol and bio-methanol. We also highlight a number of important aspects to consider when selecting marine fuels. A transition to use of LNG or methanol produced from natural gas would significantly improve the overall environmental performance. However, the impact on climate change is of the same order of magnitude as with use of heavy fuel oil. It is only the use of LBG and bio-methanol that has the potential to reduce the climate impact. The analysis did not show any significant differences in environmental performance between methane and methanol when produced from the same raw materials, but the performance of the methanol engines are yet to be validated.

TI  - Anaerobic digestion of algae biomass: A review
AB  - The anaerobic digestion of microalgae is a prospective environmentally feasible option for creating a renewable source of energy for industrial and domestic needs. Microalgae anaerobic digestion is a key unit process that integrates efficiency and beneficially into the production of microalgae derived biofuels. Anaerobic digestion culminating in methane fermentation improves the economic viability of microalgae liquid biofuel production and presents an opportunity for power generation from wastewater derived microalgae. However the anaerobic digestion of microalgae biomass is not straight forward due to several technical restraints including low concentration of digestible biodegradable substrate, recalcitrant substrate constituents, cell wall degradability, low carbon to nitrogen ratio, ammonia toxicity and effects from salinity and associated metal ions. Current production methods for liquid biofuel production from microalgae produce approximately 60-70\% residual biomass that is currently a byproduct. Anaerobic digestion provides biogas, but it can also provide essential nutrient recovery from lipid extracted microalgae biomass. The biogas produced from the anaerobic digestion process can be used to generate onsite electrical power or thermal heat to offset biomass processing and extraction processes. When both of these processes are integrated and operated simultaneously, the benefits to microalgae biofuel production and wastewater treatment derived energy production are increased significantly. To consider the integration of anaerobic digestion into a commercial-scale integrated microalgae production and biofuel refinery facility or wastewater treatment plant we present a review of the literature, the current state of the art and future directions for research.

TI  - Preferential recycling of nutrients - The ocean's way to increase new production and to pass nutrient limitation?
AB  - Uptake of atmospheric CO2 by the oceans and the export of carbon into deeper waters via the biological CO2 pump is driven by the production of particulate organic matter (POM). The elemental ratios of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus within POM follow Redfield ratios, suggesting that the concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and nutrients decrease during new production corresponding to these ratios. Subsequently, new production arid the efficiency of the biological CO2 pump are usually estimated using Redfield ratios. However, our observations in the Baltic Sea and observations elsewhere show significantly greater decreases in DIC during the productive season than that predicted from the decline in nutrients with reference to Redfield ratios, using new DIC, nutrient, and oxygen data from the Baltic Sea, we discuss this discrepancy and provide evidence that preferential recycling of nutrients fuels the productive community with nutrients. Limiting nutrients are preferentially recycled and become available for new production. These findings derived from hydrochemical bulk data confirm the picture of the microbial loop but question the common description of new production and nutrient limitation. Finally, we argue for a carbon-based efficiency estimate of the biological CO2 pump probably exceeding significantly nutrient-based estimates.

TI  - Net primary productivity, biofuel production and CO2 emissions reduction potential of Ulva sp. (Chlorophyta) biomass in a coastal area of the Eastern Mediterranean
AB  - Offshore grown macroalgae biomass could provide a sustainable feedstock for biorefineries. However, tools to assess its potential for producing biofuels, food and chemicals are limited. In this work, we determined the net annual primary productivity (NPP) for Ulva sp. (Chlorophyta), using a single layer cultivation in a shallow, coastal site in Israel. We also evaluated the implied potential bioethanol production under literature based conversion rates. Overall, the daily growth rate of Ulva sp. was 4.5 Â± 1.1%, corresponding to an annual average productivity of 5.8 Â± 1.5 gDW mâˆ’2 dayâˆ’1. In comparison, laboratory experiments showed that under nutrients saturation conditions Ulva sp. daily growth rate achieved 33 Â± 6%. The average NPP of Ulva sp. offshore was 838 Â± 201 g C mâˆ’2 yearâˆ’1, which is higher than the global average of 290 g C mâˆ’2 yearâˆ’1 NPP estimated for terrestrial biomass in the Middle East. These results position Ulva sp. at the high end of potential crops for bioenergy under the prevailing conditions of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. We found that with 90% confidence, with the respect to the conversion distribution, the annual ethanol production from Ulva sp. biomass, grown in a layer reactor is 229.5 g ethanol mâˆ’2 yearâˆ’1.This translates to an energy density of 5.74 MJ mâˆ’2 yearâˆ’1 and power density of 0.18 W mâˆ’2. Growth intensification, to the rates observed at the laboratory conditions, with currently reported conversion yields, could increase, with 90% confidence, the annual ethanol production density of Ulva sp. to 1735 g ethanol mâˆ’2 yearâˆ’1, which translates to an energy density of 43.5 MJ mâˆ’2 yearâˆ’1 and a power density 1.36 W mâˆ’2. Based on the measured NPP, we estimated the size of offshore area allocation required to provide biomass for bioethanol sufficient to replace 5â€“100% of oil used in transportation in Israel. We also performed a sensitivity analysis on the biomass productivity, national CO2 emissions reduction, ethanol potential, feedstock costs and sizes of the required allocated areas.

TI  - A review of energy extraction from wind and ocean: Technologies, merits, efficiencies, and cost
AB  - Sustainable power sources have become indispensable in modern society. The most promising renewable sources of energy are wind and ocean, which are widely distributed worldwide. As such, wind and ocean power technologies have attracted great attention of researchers and engineers, achieving the advanced stage of power development. This work aims to review the possible wind and ocean power technologies, to make a comparative assessment in terms of energy availability, efficiency and cost, and finally to share the acceptance and challenges in the wind and ocean power development. We focus on energy harvesting techniques of onshore and offshore (both fixed and floating foundations) wind energy as well as ocean energy including ocean thermal energy, wave energy, tidal energy, salinity gradient energy, and bioinspired energy harvesting. Given that the theoretical efficiency of a wind turbine is 59.3% maximum (Betz limit), most wind turbines can produce power with 30%â€“35% efficiency, which suggests a scope of further efficiency improvement. The overall offshore installation costs are 2.5â€“3.0 times the onshore costs. The vertical and horizontal axis stream turbines extracting tidal energy have a maximum of 35% efficiency while the shrouded horizontal axis stream turbines may reach 42% efficiency. Galloping turbines with triangular and trapezoidal prisms may have an efficiency up to 40% and 45%, respectively. Ocean wave energy can provide a continuous power supply. The technology however requires further improvement to be of commercial use. The bioinspired energy harvesting techniques are in the infant stages while research work on ocean wave energy and offshore wind power is going on a faster pace compared to other technologies. Recently, flow-induced vibration techniques are getting more attention from the scientific community and developing rapidly. Â© 2022

TI  - Energy boost
AB  - The UK is dealing with the shortage of people to fill the jobs in all areas in the electric utilities, with the rapid increase in the demand of electricity in the UK, hence increased investments. Investments in schemes such as nuclear new-build, particularly the existing powers stations reach the end of their life, and modern gas and coal-fired plants has created various jobs for the engineers across the board. E.ON has been investing billions of pounds to build the next generation of cleaner power stations and has also received approval to build a gas-fired power station at Drakelow in Derbyshire. It is also investing in new renewable technologies, including onshore and offshore wind power, wave and tidal, as well as biomass.

TI  - Continuous design and economic analysis of a Sargassum muticum biorefinery process
AB  - This work assesses scale effects in designing a biorefinery from Sargassum muticum seaweed by applying a detailed process modeling methodology. Two process conversion units were simulated: one considering anaerobic digestion steps for producing biogas and generating electricity (base project), and the other with residual seaweed solids sold as fertilizer (alternative project). A comprehensive economic analysis was performed to estimate the minimum selling price of the process's main product (fucoidan extract). Results indicated that capital expenditures are up to 12.7% times higher in the base project. Minimum selling prices of the fucoidan extract product demonstrate the biorefinery's economies of scale for both projects. Seaweed's low methane potential reduces the economic attractiveness of electricity generation from biogas in the base project. Conversely, organic fertilizer price was more influential in the alternative project. Nonetheless, risk analyses show similar results for both scenarios, mainly due to fucoidan extract selling price and CAPEX estimates uncertainties. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Solar photo voltaics powered seawater desalination plants and their techno-economics
AB  - Acute scarcity of surface water resources and rapidly falling underground water levels in many regions of the world, have created a compelling need for new fresh water resources, especially for population and industries located in coastal regions. The oceans are mankind's only reliable and perennial source of water. Seawater Desalination by the Reverse Osmosis (SWRO) process is currently the most cost-effective technology for small as well as large-scale fresh water production from seawater. Due to depletion of fossil fuel reserves, increasing interest is being expressed in the use of Renewable Energy (RE) sources for seawater desalination and amongst the RE Sources, Solar Photo Voltaics (SPV) power is considered as a viable option. The techno-economics both in standalone mode and in PV-biodisel hybrid mode for capacities from 0.05 MLD to 300 MLD are examined here. As a Technology Demonstrator, a plant of 500 litre/day capacity has been designed, installed and functional at Indian Institute of Technology Madras..

TI  - Design of Gabion Reinforced Railway Embankment Connecting Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal
AB  - The southeastern tip of Pamban Island, Dhanushkodi, is one of the unique attractions of Rameswaram. It is located around 20 km away from Rameswaram. The town of Dhanushkodi is surrounded by the Bay of Bengal on one side and the Indian Ocean on the other side. The railway line from Pamban Station to Dhanushkodi was destroyed in the 1964 cyclone, so by then, the rail transportation facility for Dhanushkodi was stopped. A new railway line and an embankment between Rameswaram to Dhanushkodi are proposed to increase better connectivity. The proposed railway line is highly environmentally sensitive to ocean waves and the geotechnical properties of soil. The conventional earthen embankment is not a viable solution due to the non-Availability of usable soil nearby. At the same time, an elevated railway corridor is quite expensive. Considering the extreme waves, soil characteristics, and usable landmass, a Gabion reinforced railway embankment is proposed for a height of +8.5 m from Cart datum. This embankment is exposed to both the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal region. Gabion reinforced embankments are designed to encounter the extreme wave forces on both facings as well such structures require minimal foundation width for feasible construction. Gabion reinforced embankments are economical, good in wave energy dissipation, quicker construction. Gabions with facia tails are designed for extreme wave forces, and the geotechnical stability of the same is also checked numerically. The combined hydrodynamic forces and monolithic stability of the structure are satisfactory. Â© 2022 IEEE.

TI  - Sediment and terrestrial organic carbon budgets for the offshore Ayeyarwady Delta, Myanmar: Establishing a baseline for future change
AB  - Large river deltas serve as globally important archives of terrestrial and shallow marine biogeochemical signatures and because of rapid sedimentation have the potential to impact global biogeochemical cycling. The Ayeyarwady Delta in Myanmar ranks as the world's third largest river delta in terms of sediment supply; however, modern increases in regional anthropogenic impacts risk severe alteration to sediment and TerrOC loads within this major system. By investigating modern sediment and terrestrial organic carbon (TerrOC) accumulation within the offshore Ayeyarwady Delta this study estimates baseline sediment and TerrOC budgets for this understudied mega-delta. Using 210Pb geochronology of 27 sediment cores collected from the continental shelf, we estimate that 405 (+52/-47) Mt of sediment, or ~70-80% of fluvial sediment discharged from the Ayeyarwady and Thanlwin rivers (the main inputs to the delta), accumulates there annually. Sediment not retained on the shelf is likely partitioned between the Ayeyarwady floodplain, shoreline accretion, and minor deep-sea export. Estimates of TerrOC (based on Î´13C mixing models) were coupled with modern sediment accumulation rates to determine an annual burial of 1.93 (+1.09/-0.15) Mt C on the shelf, with TerrOC burial fluxes being highest in the foreset beds of the subaqueous delta, coincident with the area of highest sediment accumulation rate. Based on estimates of the Ayeyarwady and Thanlwin rivers' TerrOC delivery, an apparent ~100% of TerrOC input is preserved on the continental shelf. However, an across shelf trend of increasing TerrOC degradation with distance offshore is also observed, indicating that while the shelf has high apparent TerrOC sequestration, carbon remineralization is also occurring prior to deposition within the subaqueous delta. Based on these conflicting outcomes, we suggest that input of TerrOC from additional sources other than the Ayeyarwady and Thanlwin rivers roughly balance the observed carbon remineralization. Main additional sources of TerrOC include the Sittang and several smaller rivers, and the Ayeyarwady delta plain below the river gauging station. As anthropogenic development within the Ayeyarwady and Thanlwin watersheds continues to increase, these sediment and TerrOC budgets provide a baseline from which future changes within the offshore Ayeyarwady Delta can be monitored.

TI  - Calcifying cyanobacteria-the potential of biomineralization for carbon capture and storage
AB  - Employment of cyanobacteria in biomineralization of carbon dioxide by calcium carbonate precipitation offers novel and self-sustaining strategies for point-source carbon capture and sequestration. Although details of this process remain to be elucidated, a carbon-concentrating mechanism, and chemical reactions in exopolysaccharide or proteinaceous surface layers are assumed to be of crucial importance. Cyanobacteria can utilize solar energy through photosynthesis to convert carbon dioxide to recalcitrant calcium carbonate. Calcium can be derived from sources such as gypsum or industrial brine. A better understanding of the biochemical and genetic mechanisms that carry out and regulate cynaobacterial biomineralization should put us in a position where we can further optimize these steps by exploiting the powerful techniques of genetic engineering, directed evolution, and biomimetics.

TI  - Microalgae and Its Premises towards Sustainable Energy Development
AB  - This paper features the use of nature's element as a tool to combat current global issues on environment. Through research works by TNB Research Sdn. Bhd. (TNBR), marine phototrophic microalgae is used in reducing CO2 emissions from its fossil-fuel based power plants using. The research program commenced in 2011 with the aim to develop capacity, capability and facilities in biological CO2 fixation. The research program focuses on improving and enhancing the CO2 fixation through four core measures; namely species selection, nutrient optimization, flue gas admission and photobioreactor (PBR) design and engineering. The measures lead to the migration and evolution of culture facilities from laboratory conditions to outdoor, from shake flasks to 6 x 250 liter pilot PBR facility at a live coal-fired power plant, from mono species to consortium of species. Increment of CO2 fixation rates is summarized with discussion on comparisons of other achievements reported elsewhere. A considerable amount of work on analysing the bioactive compound present in the algae - protein, amino acids, carbohydrate, lipid, fatty acids - and its encouraging results, as an impetus towards sustainable development, will also be shared. Premises and observations from various microalgae research works are collated and presented in a manner sufficient to highlight the eminent roles of this tiny creature to become our mentor in providing some solutions to our worldly problems.

TI  - The Potential Role of Ammonia as Marine Fuel-Based on Energy Systems Modeling and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis
AB  - To reduce the climate impact of shipping, the introduction of alternative fuels is required. There is a range of different marine fuel options but ammonia, a potential zero carbon fuel, has recently received a lot of attention. The purpose of this paper is to assess the prospects for ammonia as a future fuel for the shipping sector in relation to other marine fuels. The assessment is based on a synthesis of knowledge in combination with: (i) energy systems modeling including the cost-effectiveness of ammonia as marine fuel in relation to other fuels for reaching global climate targets; and (ii) a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach ranking marine fuel options while considering estimated fuel performance and the importance of criteria based on maritime stakeholder preferences. In the long-term and to reach global GHG reduction, the energy systems modeled indicate that the use of hydrogen represents a more cost-effective marine fuel option than ammonia. However, in the MCDA covering more aspects, we find that ammonia may be almost as interesting for shipping related stakeholders as hydrogen and various biomass-based fuels. Ammonia may to some extent be an interesting future marine fuel option, but many issues remain to be solved before large-scale introduction.

TI  - Carbon Balance in Salt Marsh and Mangrove Ecosystems: A Global Synthesis
AB  - Mangroves and salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems in the global coastal ocean. Mangroves store more carbon (739 Mg C-ORG ha(-1)) than salt marshes (334 Mg C-ORG ha(-1)), but the latter sequester proportionally more (24\%) net primary production (NPP) than mangroves (12\%). Mangroves exhibit greater rates of gross primary production (GPP), aboveground net primary production (AGNPP) and plant respiration (R-C), with higher P-GPP/R-C ratios, but salt marshes exhibit greater rates of below-ground NPP (BGNPP). Mangroves have greater rates of subsurface DIC production and, unlike salt marshes, exhibit active microbial decomposition to a soil depth of 1 m. Salt marshes release more CH4 from soil and creek waters and export more dissolved CH4, but mangroves release more CO2 from tidal waters and export greater amounts of particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), to adjacent waters. Both ecosystems contribute only a small proportion of GPP, R-E (ecosystem respiration) and NEP (net ecosystem production) to the global coastal ocean due to their small global area, but contribute 72\% of air-sea CO2 exchange of the world's wetlands and estuaries and contribute 34\% of DIC export and 17\% of DOC + POC export to the world's coastal ocean. Thus, both wetland ecosystems contribute disproportionately to carbon flow of the global coastal ocean.

TI  - Seaweed and microalgae as major actors of blue biotechnology to achieve plant stimulation and pest and pathogen biocontrol - a review of the latest advances and future prospects
AB  - Modern agriculture needs proper solutions to face the current trend of pesticides and fertilizers reduction. One of the available leverages to support this transition is the use of bioproducts that are more environmentally friendly and less hazardous for human health. Among them, blue biotechnology and more precisely seaweed and microalgae gain interest every year in the scientific community. In agriculture, seaweeds (Macroalgae) have been used in the production of plant biostimulants while microalgae still remain unexploited. Microalgae are widely described as renewable sources of biofuels, bioingredients and biologically active compounds, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), carotenoids, phycobiliproteins, sterols, vitamins and polysaccharides, which attract considerable interest in both scientific and industrial communities. They affect agricultural crops for enhancement of plant growth, seedling growth. They can also improve nutrient incorporation, fruit setting, resistance properties against pests and diseases, improving stress management (drought, salinity and temperature). The present review aimed at the interest of blue biotechnology in agronomy, with a specific focus on microalgae, their biological activities and their possible application in agriculture as a potentially sustainable alternative for enhanced crop performance, nutrient uptake and resilience to environmental stress. This review does not only present a comprehensive study of microalgae as plant biostimulants but also as biofertilizers, with a particular emphasis on future challenges these solutions will have to deal with, microalgae being able to synthesize secondary metabolites with potential biopesticidal action.

TI  - Modelling of fermentative bioethanol production from indigenous Ulva prolifera biomass by Saccharomyces cerevisiae NFCCI1248 using an integrated ANN-GA approach
AB  - Third generation biomass (marine macroalgae) has been projected as a promising alternative energy resource for bioethanol production due to its high carbon and no lignin composition. However, the major challenge in the technologies of production lies in the fermentative bioconversion process. Therefore, in the present study the predictive ability of an integrated artificial neural network with genetic algorithm (ANN-GA) in the modelling of bioethanol production was investigated for an indigenous marine macroalgal biomass (Ulva prolifera) by a novel yeast strain, Saccharomyces cerevisiae NFCCI1248 using six fermentative parameters, viz., substrate concentration, fermentation time, inoculum size, temperature, agitation speed and pH. The experimental model was developed using one-variable-at-a-time (OVAT) method to analyze the effects of the fermentative parameters on bioethanol production and the obtained regression equation was used as a fitness function for the ANN-GA modelling. The ANN-GA model predicted a maximum bioethanol production at 30 g/L substrate, 48 h fermentation time, 10\% (v/v) inoculum, 30 degrees C temperature, 50 rpm agitation speed and pH 6. The maximum experimental bioethanol yield obtained after applying ANN-GA was 0.242 +/- 0.002 g/g RS, which was in close proximity with the predicted value (0.239 g/g RS). Hence, the developed ANN-GA model can be applied as an efficient approach for predicting the fermentative bioethanol production from macroalgal biomass. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The progressive routes for carbon capture and sequestration
AB  - The global warming is directly related to the increased greenhouse gas emissions from both natural and anthropogenic origins. There has been a drastic rise in the concentration of CO2 and other greenhouse gases since the industrial revolution primarily due to the intensifying consumption of fossil fuels. With the need to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate global warming certain strategies relating to carbon capturing and sequestration are indispensable. This paper comprehensively describes several physicochemical, biological and geological routes for carbon capture and sequestration. The trend of the increase in greenhouse gases over the years is illustrated along with the global statistics for fossil fuels usage and biofuels production. The physicochemical carbon capturing technologies discussed include absorption, adsorption, membrane separation and cryogenic distillation. The algal and bacterial systems, dedicated energy crops and coalbed methanogenesis have been vividly explained as the biological routes for carbon sequestration. The geological carbon sequestering route centers on biochar application and oceanic carbon storage. A systematic survey has been made on the origin and impact of greenhouse gases along with the potential for sequestration based on some fast-track and long-term sequestration technologies.

TI  - Environmental and Economic Assessment of a Novel Solvolysis-Based Biorefinery Producing Lignin-Derived Marine Biofuel and Cellulosic Ethanol
AB  - Methanol is considered to be a viable option for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in shipping, the second-highest emitter after road freight. However, the use of fossil methanol is insufficient to meet climate change targets, while renewable methanol is yet unavailable on a commercial scale. This paper presents a novel biorefinery concept based on biomass solvolysis to produce crude lignin oil (CLO) from forest residues, a drop-in biofuel for methanol-propelled ships, and evaluates its environmental and economic profiles. In the base scenario, CLO can achieve emission saving of 84% GHG compared to fossil alternatives, and a minimum selling price (MSP) of $821 per ton of methanol equivalent (ME), i.e., within the range of the current bio-methanol production costs. The emission of GHGs of co-produced ethanol can be reduced by 67% compared to fossil analogues. The increase of renewable electricity share to 75% is capable of shrinking emissions by 1/5 vs. the base case, while fossil methanol losses, e.g., of that in cellulose pulp, can boost emissions by 63%.

TI  - Estimation of mangrove biomass and carbon absorption of Rhizophora apiculata and Rhizophora mucronata in Banda Aceh, Aceh Province
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems can reduce CO2 through a mechanism of sequestration which is absorption of carbon from the atmosphere and its storage in several compartments such as plants, litter and soil organic matter. The purpose of this study was to determine carbon uptake in the mangrove vegetation of Rhizophora apiculata and Rhizophora mucronata in Banda Aceh. The research was carried out in two sampling sites, those were Gampong Jawa and Lambaro Skep Banda Aceh on January to March, 2018. This research was conducted at Marine Chemistry and marine Biology Laboratory, Faculty of Marine and Fisheries, Syiah Kuala University. The method used in this study was destructive sampling method. The results of the study showed that the amount of carbon absorption by Rhizophora apiculata and Rhizophora mucronata were 4033.33 g CO2/tree and 3888.36 g CO2/tree, respectively. The results of statistical calculations using the t-test showed that the carbon absorption of Rhizophora apiculata and Rhizophora mucronata did not different significantly, where the value of p> 0.05 (p = 0.33). Furthermore, the differences between sites also showed that the two stations were not significantly different, with a value of p> 0.05 (p = 0.47).

TI  - Geological settings and controls of fluid migration and associated seafloor seepage features in the north Irish Sea
AB  - Shallow gas accumulation in unconsolidated Quaternary sediments, and associated seepage at the seafloor, is widespread in the north Irish Sea. This study integrates high-resolution seafloor bathymetry and sub-surface geophysical data to investigate shallow gas accumulations and possible fluid (gas and/or liquids) migration pathways to the seafloor in the northern part of the Irish Sea. Shallow gas occurs broadly in two geological settings: the Codling Fault Zone and the Western Irish Sea Mud Belt. The gas has been recognised to accumulate in both sandy and muddy Quaternary marine near-surface sediments and is characterised by three characteristic sub-bottom acoustic features: i) enhanced reflections, ii) acoustic turbid zones, and iii) acoustic blanking. The seepage of shallow gas at the seafloor has resulted in the formation of morphological features including methane-derived authigenic carbonates, seabed mounds and pockmarks. In many instances, the evidence for this gas as biogenic or thermogenic in origin is inconclusive. Two distinct types of pockmarks are recorded in the Western Irish Mud Belt: pockmarks with a relatively flat centre, and pockmarks with a central mound. Based on our observation and existing models, we infer that the formation of a carbonate crust at the seabed surface is needed as a precursor for the creation of such mounds within pockmarks. The formation processes are interpreted to be different for sandy versus muddy sediments, due to variability in erodibility and sealing capacities of the substrate. We suggest that the origin of these features is linked to the presence of deeper hydrocarbon source rocks with existing and reactivated faults forming fluid migration pathways to the surface. This in turn could indicate a mixed thermogenic-biogenic origin for seep-related structures in the study area. These features have significant implications for the future development of offshore infrastructure including marine renewable energy as well as for seabed ecology and conservation efforts in the Irish Sea.

TI  - Efficient utilization of carbon to produce aromatic valencene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using mannitol as the substrate
AB  - As a promising brown macroalgal carbohydrate, mannitol has been an alternative renewable feedstock for biofuel and biochemical production, avoiding competition with food production for natural resources. In this study, we describe a cell factory of the evolved Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on adaptive laboratory evolution that efficiently biotransforms mannitol into the high value-added sesquiterpenoid valencene. The evolved S. cerevisiae BN-91A with a series of mutations in the genome exhibited superior performance in mannitol assimilation, with the expression levels of genes involved in mannitol assimilation being dramatically upregulated by 50-480 fold. When grown on mannitol, the BN-91A strain showed a valencene titer of 17.2 mg L-1 and a carbon conversion efficiency of 1.905 mg g(-1), which were approximately 3-fold and 7-fold higher than those on glucose, respectively. Further analysis of the valencene synthase coding gene revealed an elevation of its gene dose and transcriptional level under mannitol conditions, which were 3-fold and 5-fold as much as those under glucose conditions, respectively. Moreover, the valencene titer of BN-91A had little to no impact upon salt shock, indicating the competence of BN-91A to produce valencene from macroalgae-derived mannitol. An improved valencene titer of 161.1 mg L-1 was obtained in flasks after applying a combinational engineering strategy including precursor supply enhancement, mannitol uptake facilitation and cofactor regeneration acceleration. Finally, a maximum valencene titer of 5.61 g L-1 was obtained in a fed-batch bioreactor with mannitol feeding. Our findings establish a novel strategy of terpenoid production in S. cerevisiae, which opens a new avenue for application of third-generation renewable biomass marine macroalgae.

TI  - The impact of Indonesian peatland degradation on downstream marine ecosystems and the global carbon cycle
AB  - Tropical peatlands are among the most space-efficient stores of carbon on Earth containing approximately 89 Gt C. Of this, 57 Gt (65%) are stored in Indonesian peatlands. Large-scale exploitation of land, including deforestation and drainage for the establishment of oil palm plantations, is changing the carbon balance of Indonesian peatlands, turning them from a natural sink to a source via outgassing of CO2 to the atmosphere and leakage of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the coastal ocean. The impacts of this perturbation to the coastal environment and at the global scale are largely unknown. Here, we evaluate the downstream effects of released Indonesian peat carbon on coastal ecosystems and on the global carbon cycle. We use a biogeochemical box model in combination with novel and literature observations to investigate the impact of different carbon emission scenarios on the combined ocean-atmosphere system. The release of all carbon stored in the Indonesian peat pool, considered as a worst-case scenario, will increase atmospheric pCO2 by 8 ppm to 15 ppm within the next 200 years. The expected impact on the Java Sea ecosystems is most significant on the short term (over a few hundred years) and is characterized by an increase of 3.3% in phytoplankton, 32% in seagrass biomass, and 5% decrease in coral biomass. On the long term, however, the coastal ecosystems will recover to reach near pre-excursion conditions. Our results suggest that the ultimate fate of the peat carbon is in the deep ocean with 69% of it landing in the deep DIC pool after 1000 years, but the effects on the global ocean carbonate chemistry will be marginal.

TI  - The Green Fleet Project: Energy Saving Measures
AB  - The Italian Navy has always had, among its mission, the safeguard of the marine environment, and it is strongly oriented in giving its contribution to the targets fixed form the European Parliament with the ``2020 Climate and Energy package{''}. In 2012 ITN has launched the ``Flotta Verde{''} initiative, with the purposes of reducing gas emissions and improving, at the same time, the national energy security. The paper presents an overview about the Flotta Verde initiative and a case study aimed to optimize the power consumption of Engine-room ventilation Plant for ITN ships. In particular, the study analyzes the energy needed to ensure the proper air flow in the engine-room as a function of the ship operating conditions. Aboard a navy ship, the aim of an engine room ventilation plant is to provide comfortable working conditions, and to ensure the necessary air flow to prevent heat-sensitive apparatus from overheating. The case study compares traditional solutions with new technologies in the field of energy saving and calculates the time for ROI (Return of investment).

TI  - On the energy required to maintain an ocean mirror using the reflectance of foam
AB  - Among the various interventions proposed to remediate the health and security effects of climate change by solar radiation protection is the proposal to enhance natural ocean whitecap formation. Compared to other solar protection interventions, this is technically simple and quickly terminated. However, it has a drawback: even if the energy be obtained from wind or wave, the power demand to maintain a foam raft determines the capitalization of equipment. The average power demand is inversely related to foam lifetime which can be prolonged by surfactants preferably derived from ingenerate resources. Here, we estimate the associated energy and power demands by identifying the parameters that can be adjusted to moderate the capital cost of implementation. Before dividing by efficiency factors, the range of power demand for an intermediate areal energy requirement of 5 MJ/km 2 of ocean varies from 6 to 30 W/km 2 for foam lifetime of 10â€“2 days. The most likely route to deployment is through merchant ship lubrication using bubbly liquids which both reduces fuel consumption and creates an extended wake and is perhaps an example of technical symbiosis.

TI  - Alternative fuels for marine applications: Biomethanol-biodiesel-diesel blends
AB  - Recent emission related limits imposed on marine fuel are causing the ship owners to look for alternative fuels to comply with the new limits. Depletion of fossil fuel raised the attention of researchers to investigate renewable energy sources such as biodiesel and alcohol. Methanol blends as marine fuel leads to drastically reducing sulfur and particle emissions, adopting methanol also shows lower nitrogen oxide emissions and, when produced from renewable sources, lower CO2 emissions over the entire fuel lifecycle. Biodiesel has the potential in fulfilling the environment and economic concerns as it is a renewable and sustainable energy source. Empirical relationships among physical-chemical properties and blends of biomethanol-biodiesel-diesel were assessed by direct gradient analysis. It was inspected how the physical-chemical properties change along an ordination axis of detrended correspondence analysis using â€œveganâ€ package in R. Physical-chemical properties from the multivariate model were predicted by using two types of blendsâ€™ data. The first one was based on the simulated ranges from the used data in calibration of the redundancy analysis, whereas the second one consisted of simulated ranges extrapolated up to 99% of both blends. It was concluded that a blend with 10% biomethanol and 20% biodiesel was the most suitable alternative fuel for marine applications (considering to ISO 8217:2012 standard and environmental requirements for marine fuel).

TI  - Physical and biogeochemical modulation of ocean acidification in the central North Pacific
AB  - Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is increasing at an accelerating rate, primarily due to fossil fuel combustion and land use change. A substantial fraction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions is absorbed by the oceans, resulting in a reduction of seawater pH. Continued acidification may over time have profound effects on marine biota and biogeochemical cycles. Although the physical and chemical basis for ocean acidification is well understood, there exist few field data of sufficient duration, resolution, and accuracy to document the acidification rate and to elucidate the factors governing its variability. Here we report the results of nearly 20 years of time-series measurements of seawater pH and associated parameters at Station ALOHA in the central North Pacific Ocean near Hawaii. We document a significant long-term decreasing trend of -0.0019 +/- 0.0002 y(-1) in surface pH, which is indistinguishable from the rate of acidification expected from equilibration with the atmosphere. Superimposed upon this trend is a strong seasonal pH cycle driven by temperature, mixing, and net photosynthetic CO2 assimilation. We also observe substantial interannual variability in surface pH, influenced by climate-induced fluctuations in upper ocean stability. Below the mixed layer, we find that the change in acidification is enhanced within distinct subsurface strata. These zones are influenced by remote water mass formation and intrusion, biological carbon remineralization, or both. We suggest that physical and biogeochemical processes alter the acidification rate with depth and time and must therefore be given due consideration when designing and interpreting ocean pH monitoring efforts and predictive models.

TI  - A New Biofertilizer Formulation with Enriched Nutrients Content from Wasted Algal Biomass Extracts Incorporated in Biogenic Powders
AB  - Raw algae waste naturally thrown on shores could pose serious threats for landfilling and its reuse for composting or further processing as added-value by-products require knowledge-based decisions and management for the sustainable development of local ecosystems. Raw marine waste containing salt (halite) and heavy metals that eventually accumulate in algae hamper their safe applicability in soil fertilization or in other exploitations. Here, the suitability of algal biomass for use as an environmentally safe fertilizer was investigated, thereby supporting sustainable coastal management. The simple extraction of the dry algal biomass of three abundant Mediterranean species, Enteromorpha intestinalis, Corallina elongata, and Gelidium pulchellum, in water containing sodium carbonate resulted in a greenish extract containing a reduced heavy metals content, and nutrients such as K+, PO43-, SO42-, NO3-, Ca2+, and Mg2+. UV-Vis and Raman techniques, including surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), were employed for the fast evidencing of polyphenols, carotenoids, and chlorophylls in the extracts content, while E. intestinalis extract additionally exhibited polysaccharide signals. Heavy metals analysis showed that the major metals in the extracts were Fe, Ni, Zn, and Cu; however, their levels were an order of magnitude lower than in the dry biomass. The extracts also showed a mild antibacterial effect. The combination option of aqueous extracts with powdered crustacean shells to obtain a novel, eco-friendly, solid biofertilizer complex was further shown, which could be pelleted for convenient use. The immersion of solid biofertilizer pellets in water is accompanied by re-solubilization of the compounds originating from algae extracts, presenting the opportunity for dry storage and easier handling and land applicability. In summary, aqueous extracts of marine algae waste present an environmentally safe and attractive way to recycle excessive algal biomass and to formulate a new, eco-friendly biofertilizer complex.

TI  - The Blade Design of a Bionic Shark Fin Airfoil for a Horizontal Axis Tidal Current Turbine
AB  - The horizontal axis tidal turbine is a typical apparatus to capture the energy in the ocean, but most traditional design methods of a turbine blade have led to the inefficiency of turbines. Therefore, to improve turbine efficiency, a design methodology of a horizontal axis tidal turbine blade based on bionics research is presented in this work. First, the point cloud of fin samples was scanned and processed. The three-dimensional digital models of pectoral and causal fins were extracted by reverse engineering software. Then, the bionic airfoil blade model was obtained through parameter optimization and coordinate transformation and a shark fin airfoil blade based on the bionic principle was designed, which provided a new method for the turbine blade design. Finally, the hydrodynamic performance of the bionic airfoil turbines at different pitch angles was studied through numerical simulations and underwater experiments, and the results showed that the performance of bionic airfoil turbines designed in this paper was better than that of the traditional blade turbines.

TI  - Groundwater-Driven Methane Export Reduces Salt Marsh Blue Carbon Potential
AB  - The burial of ``blue carbon{''} in coastal marsh soils is partially offset by marsh-atmosphere methane (CH4) fluxes, but this offset may be greater if other pathways of CH4 export exist. Here we report that salt marshes also export dissolved CH4 via submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). The volumetric fluxes of salt marsh groundwater into adjacent tidal creeks were calculated from mass balances of the conservative tracer Ra-226 at four study sites in coastal Georgia, USA. Over the 2-year study period, volumetric groundwater fluxes across all sites ranged between 1,700 and 105,000 m(3) day(-1). Dissolved CH4 fluxes of 27-1,200 mu mol CH4 m(-2) day(-1) were calculated by multiplying the volumetric groundwater flux by the groundwater CH4 concentration and normalizing to the intertidal salt marsh area estimated from satellite images. On a mass basis, the cross-site range in CH4 fluxes was 1.3-5.5 g CH4 m(-2) year(-1) with a cross-site mean of 2.8 g CH4 m(-2) year(-1). This is equivalent to 125 (56-245) g CO2 m(-2) year(-1) assuming that CH4 is 45 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas over a 100-year time frame. This sustained-flux global warming potential is similar to the 138 (1.1-260) g CO2 m(-2) year(-1) average calculated across other studies of the direct marsh soil to atmosphere CH4 flux. Therefore, SGD drives an effective doubling of salt marsh CH4 export that offsets a combined total of similar to 30\% of the global cooling potential derived from soil carbon sequestration. Plain Language Summary Salt marshes are wetland ecosystems found along the coast. Scientists and policymakers are interested in salt marshes because they accumulate carbon in their soil over long time scales. This carbon would otherwise enter the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, exacerbating global climate change. However, microorganisms living in the soil break down some of this buried carbon and produce other greenhouse gases, such as methane, that contribute more to warming than carbon dioxide. Scientists have measured how much methane escapes from the soil to the atmosphere. Carbon burial more than offsets this methane export, meaning that salt marshes have a small net cooling effect on Earth's climate. In this study, we incorporate a previously unaccounted pathway for methane export from salt marshes into their radiative budget. Methane in marsh soil and surrounding sediments can be dissolved in groundwater that discharges from the pore spaces between soil and sediment particles. This groundwater flows slowly toward the marsh edge until it discharges into nearby surface waters, carrying dissolved methane with it. We estimate that this methane export from groundwater approximately doubles total methane emissions from salt marshes. This is still not enough methane export to counteract all of the climate cooling benefit of carbon burial in salt marsh soils. However, it is important for policymakers to include both pathways of methane export when calculating the climate cooling benefit of carbon burial in salt marsh soils or its economic value.

TI  - Analytical assessments on the potential of harnessing tidal currents for electricity generation in Malaysia
AB  - Malaysia is heavily dependent on fossil fuel for electricity generation. With the rapidly diminishing of its fuel reserve and the increasingly negative effects of fossil fuels to the environment, the government has begun to utilise bio-fuel and solar radiation for electricity generation. However, the potential of harnessing other renewable sources, particular ocean energy, in Malaysia has not been fully realised. Therefore, studies were carried out to identify the potential of harnessing ocean energy for electricity generation. The Princeton Ocean Model was used to create a three-dimensional numerical ocean model for Malaysia which was calibrated against measurement by a means of adjoint data assimilation approach. A set of reliable tidal speed and tidal elevation data was therefore generated to determine the types of tides available in Malaysia, the potential areas of installing marine current turbines (MCTs), the total amount of electricity to be generated by MCT, the economical viability and the environmental benefits of using MCT in Malaysia. This paper presents the findings on the studies, encompassing the technical, economical and environmental aspects of installing MCT in Malaysia. The results are critical to policy makers and the potential investors on tidal energy in Malaysia for decision making. It may also help the neighboring countries to realize the possible potential of their ocean energy for electricity generation. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Science in support of ecologically sound decommissioning strategies for offshore man-made structures: taking stock of current knowledge and considering future challenges
AB  - The blue growth agenda has spurred an accelerating exploitation and continued development of the coastal and marine environment. This is also driven by the increasing need to generate renewable energy. In most cases, this has resulted in a large number of man-made structures (MMSs) across several soft sediment environments. The nature of these structures ranges from oil and gas installations to harbour walls, anchored buoys, pipelines and offshore wind farms. These structures host fouling communities that are often new to offshore regions, potentially serving as stepping stones for range-expanding (non-indigenous) species and providing habitat and shelter for a variety of marine species. The altered local biodiversity also affects biological and biogeochemical processes from the water column to the seafloor, either directly (e.g. scouring, organic matter export from piles) or indirectly (e.g. closure or displacement of fisheries) and, hence, ecosystem functioning at various spatial and temporal scales. A proper understanding of the effects of artificial hard substrate and the consequences of its removal (e.g. through decommissioning) to marine biodiversity has yet to develop to maturity. This themed article set contributes to the scientific knowledge base on the impacts of MMSs on marine ecosystems with the specific aim to fertilize and facilitate an evidence-based debate over decommissioning. This discussion will become ever more vital to inform marine spatial planning and future policy decisions on the use and protection of marine resources.

TI  - Poly(hydroxyalkanoates): Production, Applications and End-of-Life Strategies-Life Cycle Assessment Nexus
AB  - The runaway production and consumption of oil-based plastics are key drivers of global warming and the increased carbon footprint. Besides, most of this plastic debris ends up in the oceans and constitutes about 80% of all marine debris. This pollution problem calls for a seismic shift to eco-friendly plastics and marine biodegradable ones. Unlike other biobased polymers, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) take pride in their degradation in soil and marine environments. This intriguing marine biodegradation property of PHAs sets it apart as the best choice to curb microplastics, particularly in marine ecosystems. PHAs have also grown in popularity due to other quintessential properties such as biocompatibility, structural variety, and similarity to conventional plastics in terms of physical properties. PHAs are being widely researched for various applications, including packaging, medical, energy, and agriculture. This perspective comprehensively focuses on the state-of-art production and applications of PHA plastics as well as the practical recycling strategies for postconsumer PHAs. The innovative "next generation industrial biotechnology" (NGIB) is well covered in this perspective. Moreover, the nexus between end-of-life strategies and life cycle assessment (LCA) of PHAs waste is elucidated to understand its impact on the environment thoroughly.

TI  - Fuels, lubes & emissions: Is biodiesel the answer?
AB  - Biofuels, and, specifically in the case of shipping, biodiesel, have gathered some support in terms of meeting the criteria for reducing emissions and the dependency on petroleum-based fuels. Two other major areas of concern involving the marine application of biofuels center on oxidation stability and water content. The downside of biodiesels is the pressure on availability, the lack of any cost benefit over traditional marine fuels, doubts about stability, and the fact that there is no current marine specification. Unless production techniques are improved, biodiesels will remain a minor blend component.

TI  - Development of catalytic reduction of renewable carbon resources using well-elaborated organometallic complexes with PNNP tetradentate ligands
AB  - The recent depletion of fossil fuel resources has impelled industrial and academic researchers to search for alternative carbon sources. Developing sustainable resources/energy is one of the most urgent missions for human beings since the increasing resources/energy demand is in drastic conflict with the limited global fossil fuel storage. In another perspective, massive production of CO2 is inevitable and the fatal risk as far as fossil resources are continuously used as the only sources of carbon. Considerable effort has been invested in biotechnology and sustainable/green technologies to develop a chemical industry in which renewable energy resources complement dwindling fossil fuel sources for the new millennium. A round-table discussion of the US Department of Energy identified the top 30 value - added chemicals derived from biomass, which included various (poly)carboxylic acids and polyols. Non-biodegradable microplastics already plague our oceans and are destroying the world. It is really no secret. These chemicals exist in high oxidation and/or highly oxygenated/nitrogenated states, and thus, current state - of-the - art oxidation catalysts must be substantially modified so that new millennium catalysts could effectively promote the reduction and dehydration of such renewable resources. We have developed new molecular technologies based on well - elaborated metal complexes with PNNP tetradentate ligands for dehydration and reduction of unactivated amides, polycarboxylic acids, and CO2 using thermal or light energy. Those catalytic systems represent potentially sustainable methods for the production of alternative energy carriers/platform chemicals on a large scale. Herein, we offer a brief account on the development of molecular insights into mononuclear low-valent transition metal complexes for reduction of a range of renewable carbon resources.

TI  - Recent trends on seaweed fractionation for liquid biofuels production
AB  - Concerns about fossil fuels depletion has led to seek for new sources of energy. The use of marine biomass (seaweed) to produce biofuels presents widely recognized advantages over terrestrial biomasses such as higher production ratio, higher photosynthetic efficiency or carbon-neutral emissions. In here, interesting seaweed sources as a whole or as a residue from seaweed processing industries for biofuel production were identified and their diverse composition and availability compiled. In addition, the pretreatments used for seaweed fractionation were thoroughly revised as this step is pivotal in a seaweed biorefinery for integral biomass valorization and for enabling biomass-to-biofuel economic feasibility processes. Traditional and emerging technologies were revised, with particular emphasis on green technologies, relating pretreatment not only with the type of biomass but also with the final target product(s) and yields. Current hurdles of marine biomass-to-biofuel processes were pinpointed and discussed and future perspectives on the development of these processes given.

TI  - Evidence for the effects of decommissioning man-made structures on marine ecosystems globally: a systematic map
AB  - Background: Many marine man-made structures (MMS), such as oil and gas platforms or offshore wind turbines, are nearing their'end-of-life' and require decommissioning. Limited understanding of MMS decommissioning effects currently restricts the consideration of alternative management possibilities, often leaving complete removal as the only option in certain parts of the world. This evidence-base describes the ecosystem effects of marine MMS whilst in place and following cessation of operations, with a view to informing decision-making related to their potential decommissioning. Method: The protocol used to create this map was published a priori. Systematic searches of published, literature in English were conducted using three bibliographic databases, ten specialist organisational websites or repositories, and one search engine, up to early 2021. A total of 15,697 unique articles were identified as potentially relevant to our research questions, of which 2,230 were screened at the full-text level. Of that subset, 860 articles met all pre-defined eligibility criteria. A further 119 articles were identified through ``snowballing{''} of references from literature reviews. The final database consists of 979 articles. For each article included, metadata were extracted for key variables of interest and coded into a database. Review findings: The vast majority of eligible articles related to the presence of MMS (96.2\%), while just 5.8\% considered decommissioning. Overall, articles mainly considered artificial reefs (51.5\% of all articles) but increasingly oil and gas (22\%), shipwrecks (15.1\%) and offshore wind (13.1\%). Studies were distributed globally, but the majority focused on the United States, single countries within Europe, Australia, Brazil, China, and Israel; 25 studies spanned multiple countries. Consequently, the bulk of the studies focused on the North Atlantic (incl. Gulf of Mexico, North Sea, and Mediterranean Sea) and North Pacific Oceans. A further 12 studies had a global scope. Studies in majority reported on fish (53\%) and invertebrates (41\%), and were disproportionately focused on biological (81\%) and ecological (48\%) impacts. Physico-chemical (13\%), habitat (7\%), socio-cultural (7\%), economic (4\%) and functional (8\%) outcomes have received less attention. The number of decommissioning studies has been increasing since ca. 2012 but remains noticeably low. Studies mostly focus on oil and gas infrastructures in the USA (Gulf of Mexico) and Northern Europe (North Sea), covering 9 different decommissioning options. Conclusions: This systematic map, the first of its kind, reveals a substantial body of peer-reviewed evidence relating to the presence of MMS in the sea and their impacts, but with considerable bias toward biological and ecological outcomes over abiotic and socio-economic outcomes. The map reveals extremely limited direct evidence of decommissioning effects, likely driven at least in part by international policy preventing consideration of a range of decommissioning options beyond complete removal. Despite evidence of MMS impacts continuing to grow exponentially since the early 1970s, this map reveals key gaps in evidence to support best practice in developing decommissioning options that consider environmental, social and economic effects. Relevant evidence is required to generate greater understanding in those areas and ensure decommissioning options deliver optimal ecosystem outcomes.

In this paper, we propose a decarbonization roadmap for Singapore based on an analysis of Singaporeâ€™s energy landscape and a technology mapping exercise. This roadmap consists of four major components. The first component, which also underpins the other three components, is using centralized post-combustion carbon capture technology to capture and compress CO2 emitted from multiple industrial sources in Jurong Island. The captured CO2 is then transported by ship or an existing natural gas pipeline to a neighboring country, where it will be stored permanently in a subsurface reservoir. Important to the success of this first-of-a-kind cross-border carbon capture and storage (CCS) project is the establishment of a regional CCS corridor, which makes use of economies of scale to reduce the cost of CO2 capture, transport, and injection. The second component of the roadmap is the production of hydrogen in a methane steam reforming plant which is integrated with the carbon capture plant. The third component is the modernizing of the refining sector by introducing biorefineries, increasing output to petrochemical plants, and employing post-combustion carbon capture. The fourth component is refueling the transport sector by introducing electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, using biofuels for aviation and hydrogen for marine vessels. The implications of this roadmap on Singaporeâ€™s energy policies are also discussed. Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Bioenergy generation in microbial fuel cells using a blend of chitosan-alginate recovered from waste materials
AB  - In recent decades, power production utilizing wastes as sustainable resources have been attracted much attention due to limited fossil fuels and its considerable influences of climate change. A microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a device that exploit an active microbe as a biocatalyst in an anode compartment for power generation from organic matters in wastewater. The proton exchange membrane (PEM) plays an important role in the generating electrical current. This study deals with the synthesis and characterization of green copolymer-blend membranes consisting of chitosan (CS) derived from chitin recovered from waste crab shells, and alginate (Alg) from brown seaweeds both cheaply and abundantly found in nature. The blended PEMs were prepared at various volume ratios, including pristine CS and Alg PEMs, in order to elucidate the effect of each polymer on MFC performance. The synthesized membranes are investigated by maximum power density generated through MFCs operated with municipal wastewater as anolyte and 50mM potassium ferricyanide as catholyte.

TI  - MACROALGAE FOR SECOND GENERATION BIOFUELS: MYTH OR REALITY? A EUROPEAN PERSPECTIVE
AB  - The global demand for bio-fuels continues unabated. Driven by skyrocketing prices, rising concerns over environmental pollution and global warming, and the movement to alternate fuels, the world ethanol market is projected to reach 27.7 billion gallons per annum by the year 2012. However, the demand for ethanol needs to be balanced by the problems associated with the supply of the raw material feedstock. Corn and sugar cane are the major feed-stocks for the bio-ethanol industry, and the continued use of these crops will drive the food versus fuels debate even more as demand for ethanol increases. Not only does the large-scale production of corn and sugar damage the environment by the use of harmful pesticides, it uses two other valuable resources: arable land and enormous quantities of water. The challenge is to find a feed-stock which is abundant and carbohydrate-rich. This crop needs to be sustainable, use less or no agricultural inputs (pesticides, fertiliser, land, water), and not be part of the human or animal food chain. Seaweed can be that feed stock. Current cultivation technologies available will be examined and the economic aspects of using brown seaweeds for bio-ethanol production will be presented together with some personal views on the feasibility of biofuel production from seaweed.

TI  - The ocean carbon sink - Impacts, vulnerabilities and challenges
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) is, next to water vapour, considered to be the most important natural greenhouse gas on Earth. Rapidly rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations caused by human actions such as fossil fuel burning, land-use change or cement production over the past 250 years have given cause for concern that changes in Earth's climate system may progress at a much faster pace and larger extent than during the past 20 000 years. Investigating global carbon cycle pathways and finding suitable adaptation and mitigation strategies has, therefore, become of major concern in many research fields. The oceans have a key role in regulating atmospheric CO2 concentrations and currently take up about 25% of annual anthropogenic carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Questions that yet need to be answered are what the carbon uptake kinetics of the oceans will be in the future and how the increase in oceanic carbon inventory will affect its ecosystems and their services. This requires comprehensive investigations, including high-quality ocean carbon measurements on different spatial and temporal scales, the management of data in sophisticated databases, the application of Earth system models to provide future projections for given emission scenarios as well as a global synthesis and outreach to policy makers. In this paper, the current understanding of the ocean as an important carbon sink is reviewed with respect to these topics. Emphasis is placed on the complex interplay of different physical, chemical and biological processes that yield both positive and negative air-sea flux values for natural and anthropogenic CO2 as well as on increased CO2 (uptake) as the regulating force of the radiative warming of the atmosphere and the gradual acidification of the oceans. Major future ocean carbon challenges in the fields of ocean observations, modelling and process research as well as the relevance of other biogeochemical cycles and greenhouse gases are discussed.
