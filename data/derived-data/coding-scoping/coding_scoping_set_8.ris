AB  - Wave Energy Converters pose a unique engineering challenge, with complex and innovative technology, to be deployed in hostile locations with limited access opportunities. Reliability is a concern, given that failures may occur in sea states which give peak output, but which could delay repair interventions, leading to significant revenue losses. Reliability can be viewed as an economic question, in which the initial capital costs of a wave energy development, and the available energy yield at its deployed location, are balanced against the future operating and maintenance costs, and revenue losses from breakdowns. This paper describes a model based on real wave data, in which the interaction of the wave resource, capital, operating and maintenance costs, and different levels of reliability and maintainability is examined to determine their effect on the Levellised Cost of Energy from a wave farm.

AB  - For high cost, hard grid connection and low failure probability for large-scale offshore wind power, an innovate seawater desalination system is proposed. It directly couples offshore wind power with high energyconsuming seawater desalination to a new and full one. The system uses 100%off-shore wind power and adopts variable condition optimal control to maintain energy consumption per unit when fresh water production changes due to wind power fluctuation. Furthermore, it changes power transmission as fresh water transmission ashore, which not only solves the difficult problem of large-scale, and super-large-scale wind power application, saves the investment of offshore wind farms and increases the utilization efficiency of wind energy, but also solves the point source pollution problems caused by on-shore largescale and super-large-scale seawater desalination. As a result, the system is of great practical and strategic significance. Â© 2010 IEEE.

TI  - The Sleipner storage site: Capillary flow modeling of a layered CO2 plume requires fractured shale barriers within the Utsira Formation
JO  - International Journal Of Greenhouse Gas Control
PY  - 2014
VL  - 21
IS  - NA
AB  - To prevent ocean acidification and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to capture and store carbon dioxide. The Sleipner storage site, offshore Norway, is the world's first and largest engineered waste repository for a greenhouse gas. CO2 is separated from the Sleipner gas condensate field and stored in the pore space of the Utsira Formation, a saline aquifer approximately 1 km below the surface and 200 km from the coast. Statoil, the field operator, has injected almost 1 Mt/yr of captured CO2 into the storage site since 1996. The buoyant CO2 plume ascended rapidly through eight thin shale barriers within the aquifer to reach the top seal in less than three years. The plume's progress has been monitored by eight seismic surveys, as well as gravimetric and electromagnetic monitoring, which record the spreading of nine thin CO2 layers. This paper presents a capillary flow model using invasion percolation physics that accurately matches the plume's geometry. The approach differs from standard Darcy flow simulations, which fail to match the plume geometry. The calibrated capillary flow simulation indicates that a mass balance for the plume is likely, but can only replicate the plume geometry if the thin intra-formational shale barriers are fractured. The model enables an estimate of the shale barrier behavior and caprock performance. The fractures are very unlikely to have been caused by CO2 injection given the confining stress of the rock and weak overpressure of the plume, and so fracturing must pre-date injection. A novel mechanism is suggested: the deglaciation of regional ice sheets that have rapidly and repeatedly unloaded approximately 1 km of ice. The induced transient pore pressures are sufficient to hydro-fracture thin shales. The fractures enable fast CO2 ascent, resulting in a multi-layered plume. Shallow CO2 storage sites in the Northern North Sea and other regions that have been loaded by Quaternary ice sheets are likely to behave in a similar manner. (C) 2014 The Authors.

TI  - The effects of marine vessel fuel sulfur regulations on ambient PM2.5 at coastal and near coastal monitoring sites in the US
JO  - Atmospheric Environment
PY  - 2017
VL  - 151
IS  - NA
AB  - In August of 2012 the U.S. began implementing fuel sulfur limits on certain large commercial marine vessels within 200 nautical miles (nm) of its coasts as part of a North American Emissions Control Area (NA-ECA). The NA-ECA limited fuel sulfur use in these vessels to below 1\% in 2012 and to below 0.1\% starting in 2015. This work uses ambient PM2.5 monitoring data from the U.S. IMPROVE network and Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) receptor modeling to assess the effectiveness of the NA-ECA at reducing ambient PM2.5 from highsulfur residual fuel oil (RFO) use. RFO combustion emissions of PM2.5 are known to have a fairly unique vanadium (V) and nickel (Ni) trace metal signature. To determine if IMPROVE sites were affected by residual fuel oil combustion, V and Ni data from 65 IMPROVE sites in coastal States of the U.S. were analyzed from 2010 to 2011, the two years prior to NA-ECA implementation. 22 of these IMPROVE sites had a V and Ni correlation coefficient (r(2)) greater than 0.65 and were selected for further analysis by PMF. The slopes of the correlations between V and Ni at these 22 sites ranged from 2.2 to 4.1, consistent with reported V:Ni emission ratios from RFO combustion. Each of the 22 IMPROVE sites was modeled independently with PMF, using the available PM2.5 chemical speciation data from 2010 to 2015. PMF model solutions for the 22 sites contained from 5 to 9 factors, depending on the site. At every site a PMF factor was identified that was associated with RFO combustion, however, 9 sites had PMF factors where RFO combustion was mixed with other aerosol sources. For the remaining 13 sites, PM2,5 from RFO combustion was analyzed for three time periods; 2010-2011 representing the time period prior to the NA-ECA implementation (pre-NA-ECA), 2013-2014 representing the time period where fuel sulfur was limited to 1.0\% (NA-ECA 1.0\% S), and 2015 representing the time period where fuel sulfur was limited to 0.1\% (NA-ECA 0.1\% S). All 13 sites indicated statistically significant reductions in the contribution of RFO combustion to PM2.5 between the pre-NA-ECA period and the two periods of fuel sulfur control. The average decrease in annual average PM2.5 from RFO combustion from the pre-NA-ECA to NA-ECA 1\% S period was 50.2\% (range, 29.0\%-65.4\%) and from the pre-NA-ECA to NA-ECA 0.1\% S period was 74.1\% (range, 33.0\%-90.4\%).

AB  - As an alternative technology to mitigate the carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration from the atmosphere, geological sequestration had been widely accepted as a practical option because of the potential capacity and the relative safety in comparison with another option-ocean sequestration. To investigate the sciences and technologies concerned with it, Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth (RITE) initiated a research and development project for CO2 geological sequestration. The field experiment had been conducted at Nagaoka, Japan. For this technology, one of the geophysical dynamics additionally induced to the original geosystem is the dissolution of injected CO2 into the reservoir water, which is a way for storage. The density of dissolved water is changed leading to a gravity flow. This flow can make contribution to the evolution of CO2 enriched water in the terms of buoyancy. Â© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Emissions tradeoffs among alternative marine fuels: Total fuel cycle analysis of residual oil, marine gas oil, and marine diesel oil
JO  - Journal Of The Air \& Waste Management Association
PY  - 2008
VL  - 58
IS  - 4
AB  - Worldwide concerns about sulfur oxide (SOx) emissions from ships are motivating the replacement of marine residual oil (RO) with cleaner, lower-sulfur fuels, such as marine gas oil (MGO) and marine diesel oil (MDO). Vessel operators can use MGO and MDO directly or blended with RO to achieve environmental and economic objectives. Although expected to be much cleaner in terms of criteria pollutants, these fuels require additional energy in the upstream stages of the fuel cycle (i.e., fuel processing and refining), and thus raise questions about the net impacts on greenhouse gas emissions (primarily carbon dioxide {[}CO2]) because of production and use. This paper applies the Total Energy and Environmental Analysis for Marine Systems (TEAMS) model to conduct a total fuel cycle analysis of RO, MGO, MDO, and associated blends for a typical container ship. MGO and MDO blends achieve significant (70-85\%) SOx emissions reductions compared with RO across a range of fuel quality and refining efficiency assumptions. We estimate CO2 increases of less than 1\% using best estimates of fuel quality and refinery efficiency parameters and demonstrate how these results vary based on parameter assumptions. Our analysis suggests that product refining efficiency influences the CO2 tradeoff more than differences in the physical and energy parameters of the alternative fuels, suggesting that modest increases in CO2 could be offset by efficiency improvements at some refineries. Our results help resolve conflicting estimates of greenhouse gas tradeoffs associated with fuel switching and other emissions control policies.

TI  - Application Internet of Things (IoT) to calibrate with IMO 2050 Decarbonization Charters and Phase Out Greenhouse Gases from the Shipping Industry of Bangladesh
JO  - Oceans Conference Record (ieee)

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - With the application of the Internet of Things (IoT ) linking all the ships and other water vessels with different types of sensors and surveillances for reading, observation and monitoring the existing system, Bangladesh Maritime Safety Administration can calibrate with IMO 2050 Decarbonization Charter and phase out the emission of greenhouse gases to a significant level from the ships and vessels operating in the domestic and international waterways. Furthermore, according to the study, the adaptive measures, thriving in the enforcement of the environmental safety regulations, adoption of new technologies, use of alternative fuels, speed and trim optimisation and speed reduction, applications of route planning, upskilling the workforce, etc. in the context of Bangladesh, eventually create a broader and reliable hub to collect specific data from the source of polluters and help Bangladesh Maritime Safety Administration improve energy efficacy performance of the ships, especially in Annual Efficiency Ratio (AER) Energy efficiency Existing Ship index (EEXI), Energy efficiency Design index (EEDI), Carbon Intensity Index (CII) and in Fuel Oil Reduction Strategy (FORS) and thus reducing carbon emission to a significant level.Collecting primary and secondary data, the paper empirically studies the prospects of installing sensor technologies and surveillances in all the ships and water vessels for fuel efficiency, engine efficiency, carbon emission, methane emission, volatile organic compound emission, and other GHG emissions. The paper maintains that being able to holistically connect all the vehicles operating under Bangladesh Maritime Safety Administration to a single network commonly could create a comprehensive way to facilitate operational best practices, enforcing and implementing the regulatory laws effectively, preparing the budget well, and proposing changes in places where they are duly applicable.While assessing the measurements to align with IMO 2050 Decarbonization Charters, the focus has been duly placed on the cost of technologies, shortage of resources, human capital shortage, administrative challenges, policy constraints, operational challenges, and environmental impacts. Again, IMO 2050 Decarbonization parameters were carefully studied before mapping out the integration of IoT into systems. The possible measures categorised as the short-term, middle-term and long-term instruments are proposed to be implemented phase by phase, encouraging the stakeholders to enhance technical cooperation and capacity-building activities. The study also highlights how the application of IoT and augmented intelligence in the shipping industry can be a breakthrough technology, helping the stakeholders to enforce IMO 2050 Decarbonization Charter, formulate policies appropriately, use alternative low carbon and zero-carbon fuels and innovative technologies to enhance further the energy efficacy of the ships and other water vehicles. The paper concludes that giving tax rebates and financial incentives for going green and being aligned with IMO 2050 Decarbonization Charters could inspire the stakeholders. Â© 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Hydrogen fuel cells are a promising source of energy in shipping, due to its zero carbon and zero pollution operation. This article is focused on the use of PEM fuel cells, which are currently the most common in maritime sector. The often use of PEM fuel cells is also because of international and regional regulations, which require significant reduction of emissions. Operation of PEM fuel cells onboard vessel brings potential risk, however when safety countermeasures are ensured PEM fuel cells are safe to use as well as any other power sources. Vessels are typically equipped with either AC grid or DC grid. Both has different benefits, which are useful in certain applications. Due to that, PEM fuel cells must be able to be integrated into AC and DC grid. Individual examples of integration and their requirements are described in this article.

AB  - This paper presents the stability simulation results of two equivalent aggregated offshore wind farms (OWFs) based on doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) fed to two power grids through a multi-infeed hybrid HVDC system. The multi-infeed hybrid HVDC system consists of a line-commutated converter (LCC) based HVDC link and a voltage-source converter (VSC) based HVDC link. A static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) is connected at the rectifier station of the LCC-based HVDC link. A unified approach based on modal control theory of pole-assignment approach is employed to design damping controllers for the two HVDC links, respectively. Steady-state results under different wind speeds of the two OWFs are carried out. Comparative dynamic responses of the studied system with and without the designed damping controllers for the two HVDC links under wind-speed changes are also achieved. Comparative transient simulations of the studied system with and without the STATCOM subject to a three-phase fault are also performed. Â© 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Many policies and practical measures have been designed for emission reduction in shipping. Many have studied their contribution to emission reduction and impacts on the shipping industry without considering their interactions. This study analyzes how a change in one policy or measure affect the others using a system pulse model. The results suggest that the factors influencing shipping emissions are inter-dependent, and the developed systematic shipping emission model fluctuates periodically. We find that slow steaming is actually not effective in emission reduction in the long-run as it impacts the implementation of other policies. It poses a high demand for the adoption of the EEDI (Energy Efficiency Design Index) policy so as to promote the application of advanced technologies in the shipbuilding process. It also suggests that although the implementation of the EEDI policy can promote the adoption of the EEOI (Energy Efficiency Operating Index) policy, the EEOI policy actually relieves the demand for the EEDI policy.

TI  - Integrating Modular Hydrogen Fuel Cell Drives for Ship Propulsion: Prospectus and Challenges
JO  - NANA
PY  - 2011
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - This paper proposes a new drive system for the ship propulsion. The drive power for propelling ship varies from few MW in a small cruise ship to hundreds of MW for large cargo ships. A typical cruise ship has a 6 MW drive whereas a cargo ship has 80 MW drive. Combustion drives are not sustainable and environment friendly. An idea of electric drive system using hydrogen fuel cell and necessary storage has been proposed. The hydrogen reformer develops hydrogen fuel cell using off-shore renewables like Wind, Wave and Solar power but the power handling capability of this fuel cell system (100 kW) restricts the application to the propulsion drives of several MW. The detail drive scheme describing; how multiple modular hydrogen fuel cell drives are integrated to develop variable power. The different options available for the propulsion system and factors affecting the choice are discussed in detail. Also, how such modular drives are helpful in controlling torque and power requirements is discussed. Replacement of electric drive reduces volume and weight of the ship and the available volume can be utilized for the storage and reform systems. The proposed paper will give a remarkable concept to overcome the challenges of utilizing hydrogen fuel cell to the larger scale and in future it can be extended to all other applications.

AB  - The offshore wind farm industry has substantially grown in recent years. There is a substantial number of wind farms in the waters offshore Europe with several others proposed for regions in North America and Asia. A vast majority of the existing offshore wind turbines are supported on monopile foundations. The presence of a monopile in a flowing body of water causes the water to accelerate around the monopile, which can result in seafloor scour. Scour can significantly reduce the soil support thereby reducing the monopile stability and strength. Scour can also reduce the fundamental natural frequency of the turbine structure. If the natural frequency of the support structure approaches the turbine rotor frequency, a resonant condition will develop that can damage the turbine or its support structure. To avoid this situation, a monitoring system consisting of two strategically located bidirectional accelerometers was installed on the towers of four turbines of an existing offshore wind farm. The objective of the monitoring campaign was to correlate frequency measurements with the overall structural performance of the monopile foundations. The developed approach was based on operational modal analysis and system identification techniques using acceleration response data and calibrated computer models. Identified frequencies were correlated to specific structural performance limit states including; vibrating resonance of the tower with the turbine rotor, lack of foundation stability, and yielding of the monopile foundation material. This paper presents the findings of this work, which can assist owners and operators who may benefit from similar structural health monitoring systems. Â© 2013 SPIE.

AB  - Offshore wind assets have reached multi-GW scale and additional capacity is being installed and developed. To achieve demanding cost of energy targets, awarded by competitive auctions, the operation and maintenance (O&M) of these assets has to become increasingly efficient, whilst ensuring compliance and effectiveness. Existing offshore wind farm assets generate a significant amount of inhomogeneous data related to O&M processes. These data contain rich information about the condition of the assets, which is rarely fully utilized by the operators and service providers. Academic and industrial research and development efforts have led to a suite of tools trying to apply sensor data and build machine learning models to diagnose, trend and predict component failures. This study presents a decision support framework incorporating a range of different supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. The aim is to provide guidance for asset owners on how to select the most relevant datasets, apply and choose the different machine learning algorithms and how to integrate the data stream with daily maintenance procedures. The presented methodology is tested on a real case example of an offshore wind turbine gearbox replacement at Teesside offshore wind farm. The study uses k-nearest neighbour (kNN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms to detect the fault using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data and an autoregressive model for the vibration data of the condition monitoring system (CMS). The implementation of all the algorithms has resulted in an accuracy higher than 94%. The results of this paper will be of interest to offshore wind farm developers and operators to streamline and optimize their O&M planning activities for their assets and reduce the associated costs.

While the storage energy density of this energy vector is a key challenge that makes way to a variety of different solutions, from fossil fuel reformers to sodium borohydride systems, fuel cell systems are generally considered among the future ideal energy converters. Nevertheless very few fuel cell marine applications are available worldwide, none of them is related to a ship application, mainly because of the high power requirements. Fuel cells are relatively new in the shipping sector, up to now no civil industrial system has been commercialized yet while military applications rely only on the U212 submarine of the Italian and German Navy. The lack of favorable niche markets coupled with the strong conservative and traditional design principles held back the investment for optimized marine systems. For this reason, present and past projects made use of conveniently adapted automotive technologies into pilot demos, with particular focus on Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC). However, ships requirements are largely different from automotive ones, not only for the power size that are in the range of MWs instead of kWs. On the other side, in order to take advantage of large scale production as well as of the modularity of fuel cell technology, the integrations of automotive or stationary based fuel cell subsystems, already available on the market, inside a dedicate modular marine system seems to be the solution pursued by many shipbuilders and contemplated by regulatory authorities. In hybrid system configurations, fuel cells are considered in combinations with batteries, another important technology under development, in order to take advantage of the superior energy performances of fuel cell systems and the highly power discharge dynamics of batteries. The need of fuel cell power systems for ships is pushing towards the creation of knowledge that requires laboratories able to challenge the abovementioned issues in order to give answers to shipbuilders and at a lower level also to rule makers.

AB  - This paper presents the operation and characteristics of a doubly salient PM generator for tidal energy turbine. The behavior and the supply strategy of this unconventional machine is described. An energy ratio criterion is introduced and combined with a torque to mass ratio one for the design of such system taking into account both the generator compactness and the converter sizing. A simple method for the calculations of these two criterions is proposed. The influences of the main geometrical parameters which define the machine geometry are firstly studied. Then a multi-objective optimization process is used to optimize the two design criterions. From the calculations of these criterions for 20,000 set of geometrical parameters a Pareto front is highlighted. Several point of this Pareto front which corresponds to typical DSPM designs are presented and analyzed. The results highlight the interest of proposed method which optimize simultaneously the generator design and the converter size. Â© 2016 IEEE.

AB  - The techno-economic characteristics of macro-algae utilisation from European temperate zones was evaluated in a selected Anaerobic Digester (AD) using the chemical process modelling software ECLIPSE. The assessment covered the mass and energy balance of the entire process followed by the economic feasibility study, which included the total cost estimation, net present value calculation, and sensitivity analysis. The selected plant size corresponded to a community based AD of 1.6 MWth with a macro-algae feed rate of 8.64 tonnes per day (dry basis). The produced biogas was utilised in a combined heat and power plant generating 237 kWe(net) electricity and 367 kW(th) heat. The breakeven electricity-selling price in this study was estimated at around (sic)120/MWh. On the ground of different national and regional policies, this study did not account for any government incentives. However, different support mechanisms such as Feed-in-Tariffs or Renewable Obligation Certificates can significantly improve the project viability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Estimating Global "Blue Carbon" Emissions from Conversion and Degradation of Vegetated Coastal Ecosystems
JO  - Plos One
PY  - 2012
VL  - 7
IS  - 9
AB  - Recent attention has focused on the high rates of annual carbon sequestration in vegetated coastal ecosystems-marshes, mangroves, and seagrasses-that may be lost with habitat destruction ('conversion'). Relatively unappreciated, however, is that conversion of these coastal ecosystems also impacts very large pools of previously-sequestered carbon. Residing mostly in sediments, this 'blue carbon' can be released to the atmosphere when these ecosystems are converted or degraded. Here we provide the first global estimates of this impact and evaluate its economic implications. Combining the best available data on global area, land-use conversion rates, and near-surface carbon stocks in each of the three ecosystems, using an uncertainty-propagation approach, we estimate that 0.15-1.02 Pg (billion tons) of carbon dioxide are being released annually, several times higher than previous estimates that account only for lost sequestration. These emissions are equivalent to 3-19% of those from deforestation globally, and result in economic damages of $US 6-42 billion annually. The largest sources of uncertainty in these estimates stems from limited certitude in global area and rates of land-use conversion, but research is also needed on the fates of ecosystem carbon upon conversion. Currently, carbon emissions from the conversion of vegetated coastal ecosystems are not included in emissions accounting or carbon market protocols, but this analysis suggests they may be disproportionally important to both. Although the relevant science supporting these initial estimates will need to be refined in coming years, it is clear that policies encouraging the sustainable management of coastal ecosystems could significantly reduce carbon emissions from the land-use sector, in addition to sustaining the well-recognized ecosystem services of coastal habitats.

JO  - Greenhouse Gases: Science And Technology
PY  - 2020
VL  - 10

AB  - Offshore wind power plants (OWPPs), which are not yet installed in Turkey, are becoming a popular method of energy production around the world because of their environmentally friendly nature. Thus, the installation of OWPPs should be an important agenda item in terms of Turkey's renewable energy policies as a contribution to the global greenhouse gas emission targets. This study proposes a model for installing OWPPs in a suitable part of the Black Sea region of Turkey and simulates the results. The suitable locations for OWPP installation were evaluated according to the technical and geographical conditions of this region and site criteria. Meteorological data from these locations were analyzed in the Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program (WAsP) to determine the best location. In this study, an OWPP model with a 204.6 MW installed power capacity was proposed for the identified location, which has a wind speed of 8.77 m sâˆ’1 and a wind power density of 348 W mâˆ’2. Then, an OWPP model and regional energy transmission system was modeled using DigSilent software. The load flow analysis was performed using this model, and the results show that 7616 tons of toxic gas and 1.527 million tons of greenhouse gas could be reduced in the region in a year if the proposed OWPP were put into operation. Thus, with the installation of OWPP, this study shows that annual CO2 emissions can be reduced by 7.63% for the entire Black Sea region.

Alternative ship emission control measures are proposed, including international NOx emission standards for marine vessels, imposition of a 25-mile offshore shipping lane, reduction of ship cruising speeds in the port area, an economic incentive program to assist shipowners reduce engine emissions, and port infrastructure improvements.

AB  - Mangrove has been destroyed and reforestation is often undertaken, but whether a regenerated forest could restore its ecological function is not clear. This study compares microbial community structure and function in sediment of the 17-years old natural regenerated mangrove forest (Y17) with the original forest (Y74). No significant differences in phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles and microbial metabolism of most carbon substrates were found between these two forests. However, activities of dehydrogenase, protease, cellulase and phosphatase were lower in Y17 than Y74, and some specific microbial functions were also different. Both forests exhibited significant seasonal differences in enzyme activities and microbial characteristics, but such difference was larger in Y17 than Y74, indicating the regenerated forest was more sensitive to season. Correspondence analysis based on PLFA profiles and enzyme activities revealed the microbial community in Y17 was comparable to Y74, suggesting sediment microbial characteristics in natural regenerated mangroves could be restored.

AB  - In order to reduce ship emissions and improve energy efficiency, fuel cell is integrated with diesel generator as hybrid power source for ship power system, in which the basic load is provided by diesel engine and fuel cell to ptovide the rest part when the power load demand turn greater than the basic. In this study, a hybrid power system consists of diesel and alternative energy that provide main power and auxiliary power in sequence has been developed with an optimal energy management strategy proposed to minimize fuel consumption. The MATLAB + SIMULINK simulation environment was adopted to conduct the hybrid power system model to investigate the effectiveness of optimal energy management strategy by comparing ship typical drive cycle with traditional energy management strategy. The results reveal that the proposed optimization method can improve fuel economy with the battery charging profile maintained in reasonable range, and proves that by usingthe intelligent energy mangement method, the running efficiency of diesel engine can be improved, hence satisfying ship power demand and accelerating the stability of the system.

JO  - Environmental Research Letters
PY  - 2015
VL  - 10
IS  - 9
AB  - Artificial removal of CO2 from the atmosphere (also referred to as negative emissions) has been proposed as a means to restore the climate system to a desirable state, should the impacts of climate change become 'dangerous'. Here we explore whether negative emissions are indeed effective in reversing climate change on human timescales, given the potentially counteracting effect of natural carbon sinks and the inertia of the climate system. We designed a range of CO2 emission scenarios, which follow a gradual transition to a zero-carbon energy system and entail implementation of various amounts of net-negative emissions at technologically plausible rates. These scenarios are used to force an Earth System Model of intermediate complexity. Results suggest that while it is possible to revert to a desired level of warming (e.g. 2 Â°C above pre-industrial) after different levels of overshoot, thermosteric sea level rise is not reversible for at least several centuries, even under assumption of large amounts of negative CO2 emissions. During the net-negative emission phase, artificial CO2 removal is opposed by CO2 outgassing from natural carbon sinks, with the efficiency of CO2 removal - here defined as the drop in atmospheric CO2 per unit negative emission - decreasing with the total amount of negative emissions.

AB  - Offshore wind energy has become a hot spot in new-energy development due to its abundant reserves, long power generation time, high unit capacity and low land occupation. In response to the current situation whereby wind energy, and natural and human factors have not been taken into account in the selection of sites for offshore wind-energy-resource development in the traditional ``21st Century Maritime Silk Road{'' region, this paper intends to establish a new risk assessment framework that comprehensively considers the influence of wind resources, the natural environment, and the geopolitical and humanistic environment. The rationality of the new index system and weight determination methods are separately investigated. Some interesting results are obtained by comparing the new framework with traditional frameworks. The results show that the Persian Gulf, the Timor Sea in northern Australia, and the northern part of Sri Lanka in southern India are rich in wind-energy resources and have a low overall risk, making them recommended sites. In addition, unlike the results of previous studies, this paper does not recommend the Somali Sea as a priority area for wind-energy siting due to its high geographic humanity risks.

AB  - Modern offshore turbine blades can be designed for high fatigue life and damage tolerance to avoid excessive maintenance and therefore significantly reduce the overall cost of offshore wind power. An aeroelastic design strategy for large wind turbine blades is presented and demonstrated for a 100Â m blade. High fidelity analysis techniques like 3D finite element modeling are used alongside beam models of wind turbine blades to characterize the resulting designs in terms of their aeroelastic performance as well as their ability to resist damage growth. This study considers a common damage type for wind turbine blades, the bond line failure, and explores the damage tolerance of the designs to gain insight into how to improve bond line failure through aeroelastic design. Flat-back airfoils are also explored to improve the damage tolerance performance of trailing-edge bond line failures. Copyright Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

JO  - NANA
PY  - 2021
VL  - 180
IS  - NA
AB  - The hybrid propulsion is a reality now, increasing her diffusion more and more. The basic concept of Hybrid propulsion is the use of battery packs to store energy and consequentially operate the propulsion system of the ship, in order to have zero emission navigation, especially in areas of environmental interest. Especially this propulsion is spreading in passenger ships, such as small passenger ferries or yacht, due to the importance of carrying people in a clean way. This propulsion makes extensive use of Li-Ion or Li-Po batteries, storing high quantities of energy, (MWh) to provide the propulsion, furthermore, the propulsion systems are usually operating with high voltage (660 V or more) to guarantee adequate efficiency at the system. As well know, the Lithium based batteries offer a good capability storing energy, but there is also a problem of risk of explosion in case of overheating. The author will investigate in the paper, the consequences of the hybrid propulsion in small ships, considering the case study of small passenger ships, examining the interaction among the industrial solutions adopted for the realization of the hybrid propulsion system{[}1] and the specific requirements of the marine rules in terms of changes to the project, to increase the safety of the ship, The paper will examine the aspects of fire protection not only from the point of view of the passive fireprotection but also from the point of view of the containment of problem of overheating, underlining the need of a smart and combined use of manufacturing solutions and remote control systems. The paper will show how the use of the hybrid propulsion is for sure interesting in terms of environment protection, but at the same time, it requires some important changes to the project approach that cannot be underestimated.

TI  - Modeling the Growth Potential of the Kelp Saccharina Latissima in the North Atlantic
JO  - Frontiers In Marine Science
PY  - 2022
VL  - 8
IS  - NA
AB  - It has recently been proposed that macroalgae (e.g., kelp) could be grown in the open ocean as a CO2 removal strategy. Most macroalgae naturally grow in shallow coastal waters, and their ability to grow in open ocean conditions is largely untested. Here we quantify macroalgae growth potential in the North Atlantic using an established model of Saccharina latissima forced by an ocean state estimate. In the relatively clear open ocean waters, we find that growth is possible to depths of up to 50 m across most of the region, with the maximum depth-integrated growth potential between 40 and 50Â°N. The model exhibits a large carbon to nitrogen ratio at the southern end of the growth range. The ratio of kelp carbon to phytoplankton biomass is also relatively high in the southeastern portion of the growth range. Using a sensitivity analysis, we find that the position of the southern limit of the growth range is largely modulated by temperature tolerance on the western side of the basin in the Gulf Stream and low nitrate on the eastern side of the basin. We also find a statistically significant reduction in the kelp growth potential over the period from 2002 to 2019, reflecting the warming of the surface ocean over this period.

TI  - A nutrient relay sustains subtropical ocean productivity
JO  - Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences Of The United States Of America
PY  - 2022
VL  - 119
IS  - 41
AB  - The expansive gyres of the subtropical ocean account for a significant fraction of global organic carbon export from the upper ocean. In the gyre interior, vertical mixing and the heaving of nutrient-rich waters into the euphotic layer sustain local productivity, in turn depleting the layers below. However, the nutrient pathways by which these subeuphotic layers are themselves replenished remain unclear. Using a global, eddy-permitting simulation of ocean physics and biogeochemistry, we quantify nutrient resupply mechanisms along and across density surfaces, including the contribution of eddy-scale motions that are challenging to observe. We find that mesoscale eddies (10 to 100 km) flux nutrients from the shallow flanks of the gyre into the recirculating interior, through time-varying motions along density surfaces. The subeuphotic layers are ultimately replenished in approximately equal contributions by this mesoscale eddy transport and the remineralization of sinking particles. The mesoscale eddy resupply is most important in the lower thermocline for the whole subtropical region but is dominant at all depths within the gyre interior. Subtropical gyre productivity may therefore be sustained by a nutrient relay, where the lateral transport resupplies nutrients to the thermocline and allows vertical exchanges to maintain surface biological production and carbon export.

JO  - Hydrobiologia

AB  - Global warming affects the thermal stratification of freshwater lakes, and thus can lead to thermocline deepening. To follow the direct and indirect effects of thermocline shifts on processes at the sediment-water interface, the thermoclines in six of twelve lake enclosures were deepened by pumping warm surface water below the thermocline. Hypolimnetic temperatures increased and oxygen concentrations decreased due to the treatment. Path modeling suggests a correlation of the treatment to epilimnetic chlorophytes and hypolimnetic diatoms, while the dominant cryptophytes and cyanobacteria remained unaffected by the treatment. Sedimentation rates, ranging between 0.1 and 1.9 g m(-2) day(-1) per enclosure, correlated strongly with the selected phytoplankton groups, but were not affected by the treatment. Concentrations of elements (Ba, Mn, S, Sr), nutrients (NH4 (+), PO4 (3-), Si), and greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) in the upper centimeter of the sediment were not affected by the hypolimnetic changes. Methane and carbon dioxide emission from the enclosures to the atmosphere were negligible. Bacterial and viral abundance in sediments were not affected by the treatment. Results suggest that the benthic ecosystem remains unaffected by slight changes in the pelagial. Further, we conclude that short-term warming does not increase greenhouse gas emissions from temperate, deep, oligo-mesotrophic lakes.

JO  - Journal Of Plant Physiology
PY  - 2016
VL  - 203
IS  - NA
AB  - The Southern Ocean (SO) is a major sink for anthropogenic atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), potentially harbouring even greater potential for additional sequestration of CO2 through enhanced phytoplankton productivity. In the SO, primary productivity is primarily driven by bottom up processes (physical and chemical conditions) which are spatially and temporally heterogeneous. Due to a paucity of trace metals (such as iron) and high variability in light, much of the SO is characterised by an ecological paradox of high macronutrient concentrations yet uncharacteristically low chlorophyll concentrations. It is expected that with increased anthropogenic CO2 emissions and the coincident warming, the major physical and chemical process that govern the SO will alter, influencing the biological capacity and functioning of the ecosystem. This review focuses on the SO primary producers and the bottom up processes that underpin their health and productivity. It looks at the major physico-chemical drivers of change in the SO, and based on current physiological knowledge, explores how these changes will likely manifest in phytoplankton, specifically, what are the physiological changes and floristic shifts that are likely to ensue and how this may translate into changes in the carbon sink capacity, net primary productivity and functionality of the SO.

AB  - Mass conservation and metabolic theory place constraints on how marine export production (EP) scales with net primary productivity (NPP) and sea surface temperature (SST); however, little is empirically known about how these relationships vary across ecologically distinct ocean biomes. Here we compiled in situ observations of EP, NPP, and SST and used statistical model selection theory to demonstrate significant biome-specific scaling relationships among these variables. Multiple statistically similar models yield a threefold variation in the globally integrated carbon flux (~4â€“12 Pg C yrâˆ’1) when applied to climatological satellite-derived NPP and SST. Simulated NPP and SST input variables from a 4Ã—CO2 climate model experiment further show that biome-specific scaling alters the predicted response of EP to simulated increases of atmospheric CO2. These results highlight the need to better understand distinct pathways of carbon export across unique ecological biomes and may help guide proposed efforts for in situ observations of the ocean carbon cycle.

TI  - Implementation of optimization-based power management for all-electric hybrid vessels
JO  - Ieee Access
PY  - 2018
VL  - 6
IS  - NA
AB  - The increasing concern in environmental impacts contributed by the shipping industry leads to a growing interest toward incorporating sustainable energy sources to conventional power systems, to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. However, such advance power system architectures tend to face greater challenges in optimal power allocation due to the increased flexibility to split the load among multiple power sources and diversified operations of different vessel types. To address the power management challenges, in this paper, an instantaneous optimization-based approach is proposed for an all-electric hybrid power system, which adopts the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS). First, the dynamic models of the all-electric hybrid power system are formulated in MATLAB\Simulink and validated on a laboratory-scaled hybrid power system testbed. The power management problem is then formulated using ECMS approach, and a multi-level power management framework is proposed to integrate ECMS solution for practical implementation on an all-electric hybrid vessel. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed approach is validated on a full-scale setup identical to an actual all-electric hybrid vessel with dc distribution in MARINTEK, Trondheim, Norway. The performance of ECMS is also benchmarked against an improve rule-based strategy. The experimental results demonstrated that ECMS can achieve a substantial fuel savings of up to 24.4% as compared with improved rule-based strategy over one cycle of harbor tugboat operations, with the presence of available shore charging.

AB  - Fuel prices and environmental concerns are a high priority for shipowners. The International Maritime Organization's (IMO) Maritime Environment Protection Committee adopted guidelines for the voluntary CO2 indexing of ships in July 2005. In association with Lloyd's Register (LR), studies have recently been undertaken to investigate how to reduce ships' fuel consumption and emissions while remaining cost-neutral. Adopting advanced technologies and best-practice operation management indicated significant potential for consumption reduction. For newbuilds, the proposed operating profile and tailoring the selection of the plant should be taken into account, whereas for existing ships, ship energy management should harmonize the ship's operations with the efficient use of the installed plant.

JO  - Marine Pollution Bulletin

VL  - 56
IS  - 6
AB  - The proposed plan for enrichment of the Sulu Sea, Philippines, a region of rich marine biodiversity, with thousands of tonnes of urea in order to stimulate algal blooms and sequester carbon is flawed for multiple reasons. Urea is preferentially used as a nitrogen source by some cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates, many of which are neutrally or positively buoyant. Biological pumps to the deep sea are classically leaky, and the inefficient burial of new biomass makes the estimation of a net loss of carbon from the atmosphere questionable at best. The potential for growth of toxic dinoflagellates is also high, as many grow well on urea and some even increase their toxicity when grown on urea. Many toxic dinoflagellates form cysts which can settle to the sediment and germinate in subsequent years, forming new blooms even without further fertilization. If large-scale blooms do occur, it is likely that they will contribute to hypoxia in the bottom waters upon decomposition. Lastly, urea production requires fossil fuel usage, further limiting the potential for net carbon sequestration. The environmental and economic impacts are potentially great and need to be rigorously assessed. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Indonesian seas have not been used as a source of electricity yet. One of the potential and abundant sources of energy from the sea is ocean waves. This study describes the measurement of the wave characteristics and calculates its spatial and temporal energy in Pari Island which can be utilized as electrical energy using overtopping ocean wave power plants scheme. The energy that can be harvested from ocean waves is calculated by wave energy converter using the Wave Dragon WEC. This converter is the terminator type. Sea waves on the Pari Island are classified as the smooth sea with 0.16-0.51 meters significant wave height and 2-4 seconds period. The calculated WEC can produce energy up to 28 Mega Joules and power up to 6 Mega Watts. Based on this calculation, Wave Dragon which is an overtopping WEC is able to meet the electricity needs on Pari Island with two options, The first one is using 35 units of WD 1 on the Pari Island Coast with a 500 m distance from the settlement, or the second one is using 6 units of WD 2 which is located in the northeast region of Pari Island waters with 18 Km distance from the settlement of Pari Island.

AB  - The Royal Thai Government recently launched its latest policy regarding the installation of 1,800 MW wind power capacity by 2025. While onshore wind power has significant limitations due notably to land use constraints and public acceptance, offshore wind energy offers good opportunities of development and is thus an interesting alternative. The main objective of this paper is to present the offshore wind resource assessment of the Gulf of Thailand, which covers an area of 320,000 km2. A coupled mesoscale-microscale model is used, along with R1 NCEP/NCAR global reanalysis database, to generate a high resolution wind resource map. Results show that interesting potential areas for offshore wind farm development have wind speeds of up to 6.5 m/s, especially in the upper part of the Gulf of Thailand, covering a surface of 2,112 km 2. With a total potential installed capacity of 5,000 MW, the annual energy production is estimated at 9.64 TWh/year. Â© 2014 Asian Institute of Technology.

AB  - The International Maritime Organization adopted a strategy to reduce the total annual GHG emissions from international shipping by at least 50% by 2050, compared to 2008 levels. The European Union proposed an even farther reaching transformation: the European Commission adopted a set of proposals to make the EUâ€™s transport policies fit for reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. Therefore, all industrial actions in line and consistent with these strategies are essential. One of such activities may be a gradual transition from the most common independent controls of transport shipsâ€™ thrusters, propellers, and rudders to an integrated, power optimized, 3 degrees of freedom joystick control. In this paper, the full mission bridge simulator (FMBS) research on potential energy savings and, consequently, a GHG emission reduction, while steering a RoPax twin-screw ferry equipped with bow thrusters by a joystick control, is presented. The task of navigators engaged in the research was to steer the vessel either via classic engine, rudder, and thruster levers or via a joystick while (1) following the predefined straight track, (2) rotating at the turning area, and (3), finally, crabbing (moving sideways) until stopping at the quay fenders. The conclusions are that energy savings of approximately 10% can be expected for berthing manoeuvres controlled by a joystick, compared to independent actuatorsâ€™ controls. These conclusions have been drawn from a statistical analysis of the shipâ€™s energy consumption during typical manoeuvring phases of 18 berthing operations performed in FMBS. Â© 2021 by the authors.

VL  - 21

AB  - The paper presents problems of limitation the nitrogen oxides emission from marine diesel engines. The emission of noxious substances from combustion of marine fuels is restricted in respect of the atmosphere protection, International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations and others. The IMO requirements were determined by time of being in force. The first tier started in 2000 year, the second in 2011, the third is being valid from 2016 on USA waters and in some chosen port areas (from 2021 will be obligatory on Baltic Sea, North Sea and English Channel) and it is a necessity to comply those last requirements. In case of NOx- between the first and second tier the emission was limited 20\%, while the third step was limited 80\% of the first one. This is a very great challenge, because in nowadays marine diesel engines and marine heavy and diesel oils generally applied, it would seem impossible comply those requirements. It was formed environmental controlled areas of NOx emission (ECA) and they will extend. Governments of some countries (USA, Norway) were introduced on own territorial waters the requirements of NOx and SOx emission. In case of exceeding the limits (or a lack of the proper certificates) it was imposed an ecological charge (a form of tax) or the interdict of entrance on regulated water zones. In the paper it was given an attention to the new challenges for engine producers and ship-owners of fulfilling tier 3 standards or search new substitute solutions. The applying solutions for nitrogen oxides emission limitations cause the decreasing of engine efficiency and increasing the fuel consumption (and carbon dioxide emission) up to ten percent. Due to regulations of marine environment protection they generate additional investment and operation cost for ship-owners and charterers.

AB  - The offshore wind turbine generators (DFIG) are difficult to maintain caused by their low accessibility, so the accuracy of fault identification is higher than onshore DFIGs. The slip power makes the fault characteristics very weak and difficult to identify when DFIGs are close to synchronous speed operation. An identification method was proposed for early faults of inter-turn short-circuit in rotor windings of offshore DFIGs, which was characterized by the differential value of (two-side linkage's observation, TSLO). According to the mechanism of the short-circuit fault in the DFIG rotor windings, the expression of the differential value of TSLO in the inter-turn short circuit was derived. Then the robustness of the fault feature to the slip variation and the rotational speed measurement error is verified by simulation. The simulation and experimental results show that the differential value of TSLO has high sensitivity and high reliability for the early fault identification of the rotor windings in DFIGs, which provides technical support for the accurate identification of the inter-turn short circuit of the rotor windings in DFIGs.

VL  - NA

AB  - There is a growing interest in electrification of offshore production assets using renewable energy devices. Typical configurations have arrays of power generating devices, located a short distance away from the platform and linked by subsea cables. To date, floating offshore wind turbines and wave energy converters have been trialed as sources of electrical power. With hulls, moorings and cables set out in close proximity, there is a unique station keeping risk profile that needs to be managed, to ensure fitness for service through the life of the field. When developing electrification schemes, there is a body of relevant research that can be accessed to help identify and control mooring risks. In the early days of North Sea floating production, the industry encountered multiple instances of accelerated mooring line degradation. The causes and mitigations were researched through joint industry projects, leading to the publication of operating guidance through OGUK, the HSE, ISO and others. This guidance, along with a series of milestone papers, offers a valuable body of learning that is available to electrification projects. In this paper, the authors survey the integrity threats and challenges affecting moorings in electrification schemes that are based around small arrays of wind turbines or wave energy converters. Through qualitative risk assessment, comparison is made to mooring integrity issues in the floating production sector. The relevance of guidance from oil and gas is reviewed. Consideration is given to the consequences of a line failure, and how in some cases these may represent intolerable risks. It is argued that a through-life integrity risk assessment is essential for successful deployments; also, that existing OGUK guidance on mooring integrity be extended, to reflect the specifics of electrification projects.

AB  - Cabling systems specialist Nexans has introduced an innovative hybrid MV (medium-voltage) ship-to-shore connection cable that helps ships berthed in port to cut their engines and plug in to the local power grid and providing an integral data and telecommunication link. This cable will help large ships to make use of AMP (alternative maritime power) systems that effectively eliminate the production of greenhouse gases while in port, and reducing noise emissions and saving on fuel costs. The advanced cabling solution is aimed mainly at the advanced generation of large container vessels, LNG tankers, ferries, and cruiseships, which require vast quantities of electric power to support heating, air conditioning, lighting, and computer control systems. The cable also integrates MV power supply, and controls cores and optical fibers for data transmission such as telephone and Internet in a single, rugged cable, designed to be easy to reel either from onboard or from portside.

JO  - Economic Policy
PY  - 2013
VL  - 28
IS  - 76
AB  - International aviation and maritime transport account for a significant and growing share of global carbon emissions. Yet they are not only excluded from the Kyoto agreement and all current carbon pricing schemes, but do not even pay fuel excises of the type standard for other transport activities. Moreover, each sector benefits from preferential tax treatment - failure to charge VAT on international aviation, and the application of tonnage tax regimes rather than the normal corporate tax in maritime. This paper considers the design of fuel charges in these sectors to address these distortions, and quantifies their impact on emissions, revenue and welfare - showing, amongst other things, that the gain from offsetting the pre-existing tax distortions may be as significant as those from reducing emissions. It shows, too, how compensation schemes can be designed to protect the poorest countries - a key ingredient in the politics of the issue, given the practical need for wide applicability of such charges. The real challenge is to amass the degree of international cooperation required (especially strong for maritime), failure of which to some degree explains their current under-taxation - and, unsurprisingly, to decide who gets the money. Technically, these charges should, if anything, be rather easy to implement. Michael Keen, Ian Parry and Jon Strand

PY  - 2015
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - The signals are everywhere that our planet is experiencing significant climate change. It is clear that we need to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from our atmosphere if we want to avoid greatly increased risk of damage from climate change. Aggressively pursuing a program of emissions abatement or mitigation will show results over a timescale of many decades. How do we actively remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to make a bigger difference more quickly? As one of a two-book report, this volume of Climate Intervention discusses CDR, the carbon dioxide removal of greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere and sequestration of it in perpetuity. Climate Intervention: Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reliable Sequestration introduces possible CDR approaches and then discusses them in depth. Land management practices, such as low-till agriculture, reforestation and afforestation, ocean iron fertilization, and land-and-ocean-based accelerated weathering, could amplify the rates of processes that are already occurring as part of the natural carbon cycle. Other CDR approaches, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration, direct air capture and sequestration, and traditional carbon capture and sequestration, seek to capture CO2 from the atmosphere and dispose of it by pumping it underground at high pressure. This book looks at the pros and cons of these options and estimates possible rates of removal and total amounts that might be removed via these methods. With whatever portfolio of technologies the transition is achieved, eliminating the carbon dioxide emissions from the global energy and transportation systems will pose an enormous technical, economic, and social challenge that will likely take decades of concerted effort to achieve. Climate Intervention: Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reliable Sequestration will help to better understand the potential cost and performance of CDR strategies to inform debate and decision making as we work to stabilize and reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide.

AB  - Electrification of vessel power and propulsion system has been widely utilized in the shipbuilding industry in recent years. It is expected to be adopted in all marine vessel segments as the increasingly strict marine greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions regulations push the maritime fleet to decrease its reliance on conventional fuels such as marine diesel oil (MDO). With the development of sustainable energy sources and energy storage technologies, such as fuel cells, batteries, and super-capacitors, these renewable energy sources are integrated into the marine electric power system to reduce or even achieve zero-emission operation. A comprehensive shipboard power system model is thecrucial foundation for the further research. In this paper, a hybrid shipboard power configuration will be studied and modeled using Matlab/Simulink. The detailed model using average converters' models for the ship power system will be described. Besides, the simulation results shall be shown andanalyzed considering a typical harbor tugboat load profile. Â© 2020 IEEE.

AB  - In addition to the use of waste heat from the vessel's exhaust gas to save energy onboard, reduce the carbon emissions of the ship, and combine the characteristics of ship waste heat, mathematical modeling and testing of ship waste heat temperature difference power generation were carried out in this study. Finally, an experimental platform for temperature differential power generation was established to assess the impact of influencing agents on the efficiency of temperature differential power generation. The results show that the effect of different thermally conductive greases on the efficiency of temperature differential power generation tablets is basically the same. In addition, the rate of flow of cooling water, the cooling plate area, and the heat source temperature have more significant effects on the open-circuit voltage and maximum output power. The results show that the maximum power output growth rate increases with increasing cooling water flow, reaching 8.26\% at 4 L/min. Likewise, increasing the heat source temperature enhances the maximum output power growth rate by 15.25\% at 220 degrees C. Conversely, the maximum output power of the temperature difference power generation device decreases as the cooling plate area increases, and the maximum output power reduction rate is 15.25\% when the cooling plate area is 80 x 200 mm(2) compared to the case of using a cooling plate area of 80 x 80 mm(2). Moreover, the maximum output power of the temperature differential power generation device reaches 13.6 W under optimal conditions. Assuming that the temperature difference power generation plate is evenly distributed on the tailpipe of the 6260ZCD marine booster diesel engine, it could save approximately 5.44 kW center dot h electric power per hour and achieve a reduction in CO2 emissions of 0.3435 kg per hour.

More specifically, we analyse the changes in the dry beach area (quantified through the Pelnard-Considere equation) with and without wave farm protection by means of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. The model is selected after a thorough comparative study involving forty ANN architectures, with one and two hidden layers, and two training algorithms (Levenberg-Marquadt and Bayesian regression). The best results are obtained with a {[}5-10-1] architecture trained with the Bayesian regression algorithm. Once validated, this ANN model is applied to optimize the design and position of the wave farm. The results confirm that ANN models are a useful design tool for hybrid wave farms.

The International Convention on the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) was amended in September1997 and the amendment essentially addresses this vital concern by stipulating regulations for the prevention of air pollution from ships. The tier II and III amendments, currently under deliberation are likely to be brought into force by 2010 with more stringent emission regulations which shall impose new challenges to the marine engine designers. Air pollution control standards, reduction of emissions through engine re-design techniques being adopted by engine manufacturers, cutting down emissions in existing engines by use of aftermarket retrofits and use of alternative fuels / technologies are discussed. Alternative propulsion methods focused around gas turbines aided by other sustainable green technology that can be harnessed to power ships in the current scenario of global warming and high dependence on fossil fuels with soaring prices are also highlighted.

Reductions in blade thickness generally improve performance but must be balanced against the extra cost of material required to make thinner blades strong enough. The authors have carried out a parametric study to quantify the effects of blade geometry choice and construction method on the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) of the turbine, at a range of flow speeds typical for tidal power sites. Both hydrodynamic and structural analyses have been used to develop the blade design, taking into account known costs of materials and manufacture based on experience of building megawatt-scale turbine rotors. The methodology and results from this study can be used by turbine designers to determine the optimum blade thickness for a given flow condition.

AB  - The more and more severe international standards, the rising cost of fuel and a growing awareness of the environmental impact of pollutant emissions have led energy efficiency to become a topic of great interest in the marine field. The strategy for increasing energy efficiency may refer both to the consumption reduction and to the increase of energy recovery systems. This need turns out in monitoring and control strategies for energy processes on board. Monitoring information is recorded and stocked in a database, that needs to be analyzed to find out patterns in large data sets. A huge amount of data, from a RO-RO Passenger ship, has been analyzed in order to gain a further insight into ship performances. Improvements in ship energy performances cannot be reached without a in-depth study of the historical data of the vessel attitude. Moreover, some general indications are given in relation with the experience gained while managing and observing the huge amount of data involved in this study.

AB  - Generating electricity from waves is predicted to be a new source of renewable energy conversion expanding significantly, with a global potential in the range of wind and hydropower. Several wave power techniques are on the merge of commercialisation, and thus evoke questions of environmental concern. Conservation matters are to some extent valid independent of technique but we mainly focus on point absorbing linear generators. By giving examples from the Lysekil project, run by Uppsala University and situated on the Swedish west coast, we demonstrate ongoing and future environmental studies to be performed along with technical research and development. We describe general environmental aspects generated by wave power projects; issues also likely to appear in Environmental Impact Assessment studies. Colonisation patterns and biofouling are discussed with particular reference to changes of the seabed and alterations due to new substrates. A purposeful artificial reef design to specially cater for economically important or threatened species is also discussed. Questions related to fish, fishery and marine mammals are other examples of topics where, e.g. no-take zones, marine bioacoustics and electromagnetic fields are important areas. In this review we point out areas in which studies likely will be needed, as ventures out in the oceans also will give ample opportunities for marine environmental research in general and in areas not previously studied. Marine environmental and ecological aspects appear to be unavoidable for application processes and in post-deployment studies concerning renewable energy extraction. Still, all large-scale renewable energy conversion will cause some impact mainly by being area demanding. An early incorporation of multidisciplinary and high quality research might be a key for new ocean-based techniques. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To meet the stringent gas emissions legislation in marine industry achieving green shipping, the ship operational behavior in actual sailing condition is one of the major concerns for designers and ship owners. In this study, the assessment of fuel consumption and pollutant gas emissions during a container ship operating scenarios was carried out by a hydrodynamic vessel movement model capable of representing the vessel propulsion behavior. The marine engine equipped with turbocharger as well as shafting system and fixed pitch propeller was included in vessel propulsion model by separated sub models connecting the required variables to each other. The propulsion system performance in calm water was well validated by a container ship seakeeping test published in 2003. When sailing encounters heavy weather, the severe ship motion induced by irregular waves bring the thruster very close to water surface, making propeller susceptible to ventilation and causing huge thrust loss. Step modulation strategy of power management system has been employed to save thrust loss and improve fuel efficiency in this study. It manages to save large thrust degeneration and along with benefit of thrust efficiency and emission mitigation, but at the expense of shortened sailing distance. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - IMO is introducing two different emission indexes for a vessel: the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI). The former will be used to assess the design of the vessel, the latter would be used to evaluate the vessel in operation. Both indexes represent the ratio between emissions, in mass of CO2, and the transported cargo quantity per sailed distance. At moment an important debate is focusing on the definition of the 'baseline' values for different ship categories. The collaboration between d'Amico Shipping Company, Registro Italiano Navale and Department of Naval Architecture, Marine Engineering, Electric Engineering of Genoa University provided the framework for a study aimed to evaluate the carbon footprint of the vessels of the D'Amico fleet, the analysis of various aspects of factors effecting the carbon dioxide emissions caused by ships and improvements of fleet energy management techniques. The results of the study can be divided into two main aspects: it is a picture of the actual carbon dioxide emission status of a cargo fleet and it gives the technical instruments and measure tools to start an emission control policy with reference to a ship energy efficiency management plan.

AB  - Although visual effects may be the most defining characteristic of a wind project, implementing fair, transparent and just decision-making processes may be a significant determining factor in success. To shed light on this question, we undertook a study of perceptions of mainland coastal and island residents proximate to the Block Island projectâ€”the first offshore wind project in the United States. The study included a longitudinal survey of residents prior to and after turbine installation, and semi-structured interviews with residents and key stakeholders. We assessed the extent to which respondents were engaged in the planning process, opinions of transparency and fairness, and degree to which the planning process affected their opinion. Although interviewees who held a negative view of state government indicated that it did not cause them to oppose the project, trust in state government was the primary driver of perceptions of process fairness, which in turn was the primary driver of project support. We also found individuals to withhold final judgment of the process until the final outcomeâ€”project operation. Finally, fair process was seen as having benefits distinct from its effect on the outcomeâ€”that is, local residents valued the process itself. Â© 2019 The Authors

TI  - Artificial reef effect in relation to offshore renewable energy conversion: State of the art
JO  - The Scientific World Journal
PY  - 2012
VL  - 2012
IS  - NA
AB  - The rapid worldwide growth of offshore renewable energy production will provide marine organisms with new hard substrate for colonization, thus acting as artificial reefs. The artificial reef effect is important when constructing, for example, scour protections since it can generate an enhanced habitat. Specifically, artificial structures can create increased heterogeneity in the area important for species diversity and density. Offshore energy installations also have the positive side effect as they are a sanctuary area for trawled organisms. Higher survival of fish and bigger fish is an expected outcome that can contribute to a spillover to outer areas. One negative side effect is that invasive species can find new habitats in artificial reefs and thus influence the native habitats and their associated environment negatively. Different scour protections in offshore wind farms can create new habitats compensating for habitat loss by offshore energy installations. These created habitats differ from the lost habitat in species composition substantially. A positive reef effect is dependent on the nature and the location of the reef and the characteristics of the native populations. An increase in surface area of scour protections by using specially designed material can also support the reef effect and its productivity. Â© 2012 Olivia Langhamer.

TI  - Technical potential and abatement costs associated with the use of process emissions from sugarcane ethanol distilleries for EOR in offshore fields in Brazil
JO  - International Journal Of Greenhouse Gas Control
PY  - 2016
VL  - 52
IS  - NA
AB  - This study evaluates the technical feasibility and the abatement costs of the use of CO2 that is generated by the fermentation of ethanol produced in the South-Central region of Brazil to perform enhanced oil recovery using CO2 (CO2-EOR) in oil fields of the Campos basin. This mitigation alternative includes the capture of CO2, its transportation to the location of use and injection. The fermentation of ethanol produces a high concentration stream of CO2 and therefore has a low cost of capture. The technical feasibility analysis demonstrates the potential to use approximately 80% of the CO2 that is emitted by the distilleries. The abatement costs vary with the costs of dehydration, compression and injection of CO2 and with the type of investor in the CO2-EOR infrastructure, which could be an oil company or a set of distilleries. When an oil company invests in the EOR infrastructure, the average abatement cost is approximately US$ 200 per tonne of CO2. When distilleries are the investors, the average abatement cost is approximately US$ 350 per tonne of CO2. This disparity is because the revenue from selling the oil that is produced by EOR is much higher than the revenue from selling the CO2 at the wellhead. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Two 600kW wind turbines were built in the Setana Port area in summer, 2003, and started official electric generation from April 1st, 2004. They are the very first wind turbines built in the offshore area in Japan. In Hokkaido, there are many wind energy development projects on land, and of course there are many wind turbines operating in Tohoku area, northern part of Honshu Island, too. While offshore wind farms, consisting of ten to twenty wind turbines at a single offshore location, are being built and operated from 1980s and 90s in Europe, no such offshore project is realized in Japan before. But cooperating with the Setana Town government, RIOE(Research Institute for Ocean Economics) had examined the feasibility of the offshore site selection of wind turbines, thanks to the large unused sea area of the port and to the financial support from NEDO(New Energy Development Corporation). Potential of the wind energy on site is quite favorable with 7.9m/s average through a year, and good efficiency is expected. RIOE organized research committee on this project for a couple of years and executed the basic design phases. Joint Venture Construction company consisted of Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Penta-Ocean companied were engaged in construction and had unique experience. Problems faced with are not only in the technical but also in the economic field with regard to selling the produced electricity to the Hokkaido Electric Company. Those experiences are described and discussed the possibility of the offshore wind farms in Japan in this paper. Â© 2004 IEEE.

TI  - SPRINGS: Subsea seawater treatment - Case study
JO  - Proceedings Of The Annual Offshore Technology Conference
PY  - 2013
VL  - 1
IS  - NA
AB  - New local subsea processing systems will need to be developed to allow remotely located satellite oil fields to be produced economically. One such system treats seawater for injection into the reservoir. As reservoir waters often contain elevated concentrations of barium or calcium, treatment systems need membranes to remove any sulfates that may form in the seawater before it is injected into the reservoir, in order to avoid severe scaling. SPRINGS (Subsea PRocess and INjection Gear for Seawater) is a collaboration project between Total, Saipem, Veolia Water and VWS Westgarth. It was initiated in 2007 and aims to provide robust solutions featuring the use of membranes for treating seawater on the sea bed in deepwater areas. SPRINGS has now reached qualification stage and a first industrial application is planned for 2015. This paper describes the SPRINGS development project, including an update on the latest progress to date. It presents a specific case study conducted in the Gulf of Guinea which illustrates the commercial and technological advantages, along with the limitations, of deploying this technology for future remote applications. It compares the conventional field architecture utilized in conjunction with water injection from FPSO topsides with the architecture required for a SPRINGS solution on the ocean floor. The information provided allows operators to consider an alternative development strategy for the application of membranes to water injection in remote satellite fields.

AB  - Relatively few studies have been performed on the evaluation of offshore wind resources, and these have been conducted mostly in Northern Europe. In Mediterranean areas the lack of such studies is mainly linked to (1) the difficulty of meteorological monitoring in deeper waters, (2) the complex orography, frequently extending down to the coasts, (3) the sea breeze wind regimes and (4) local winds such as the Bora, Mistral and Sciroc. In the North Adriatic Sea, a shallow basin of the Mediterranean, the first reason is not applicable, but the others are sufficient to make the evaluation of wind speed methods challenging. In this article we estimate the wind climatology at a platform located 15 km offshore of Venice based on 7 years of data and compare it with the wind climatology obtained by five different methods using the long-term data from four coastal meteorological stations, Venezia Tessera, Venezia San Nicola, Ronchi and Rimini. We discuss the applicability of these methods and find that the WAsPÂ® model of RisÃ¸ National Laboratory is still the best tool for wind climate estimates. The results of two new methods are promising, but the methods still require some development. Copyright Â© 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Dynamic-geochemical model is a powerful instrument to evaluate the geochemical effects on CO2 storage capacity, injectivity and long-term containment. The study objective is to apply an integrated multi-step workflow to a carbon capture and storage (CCS) candidate field (offshore), namely hereinafter H field. From experimental analyses, a comprehensive real data-tailored reactive transport model (RTM) has been built to capture the dynamics and the geochemical phenomena (e.g., water vaporization, CO2 solubility, mineral alteration) occurring during and after the CO2 injection in sedimentary formations. The proposed integrated workflow couples lab activities and numerical simulations and it is developed according to the following steps: 1. Mineralogical-chemical characterization (XRD, XRF and SEM-EDX experimental techniques) of field core samples; 2. Data elaboration and integration to define the conceptual geochemical model; 3. Synthetic brine reconstruction by means of 0D geochemical models; 4. Numerical geochemical modelling at different complexity levels. Field rocks chosen for CO2 injection have been experimentally characterized, showing a high content of Fe in clayey, micaceous and carbonate mineralogical phases. New-defined, site-specific minerals have been characterized, starting from real XRD, XRF and SEM-EDX data and by calculation of their thermochemical parameters with a proprietary procedure. They are used to reconstruct synthetic formation water chemical composition (at equilibrium with both rock mineralogy and gas phase), subsequently used in RTM. CO2 injection is simulated using 2D radial reactive transport model(s) built in a commercial compositional reservoir simulator. The simulations follow a step-increase in the complexity of the model by adding CO2 solubility, water vaporization and geochemical reactions. Geochemical processes impact on CO2 storage capacity and injectivity is quantitatively analyzed. The results show that neglecting the CO2 solubility in formation water may underestimate the max CO2 storage capacity in H field by around 1%, maintaining the same pressure build-up profile. Sensitivities on the impact of formation water salinity on the CO2 solubility are presented. In a one thousand years' timescale, changes in reservoir porosity due to mineral alteration, triggered by CO2-brine-rock interactions, seem to be minimal in the near wellbore and far field. However, it has been seen that water vaporization with the associated halite precipitation inclusion in the simulation models is recommended, especially at high-level of formation brine salinity, for a reliable evaluation of CO2 injectivity related risks. The proposed workflow provides a new perspective in geochemical application for CCS studies, which relies on novel labs techniques (analyses automation), data digitalization, unification and integration with a direct connection to the numerical models. The presented procedure can be followed to assess the geochemical short-and long-term risks in carbon storage projects. Copyright Â© 2021 Society of Petroleum Engineers.

AB  - Understanding the future offshore wind energy is crucial for making an appropriate energy strategy. Yet how offshore wind energy will respond to the rapidly intensifying global warming remains inconclusive. Focusing on a tropical sea in Vietnam, this study assesses the climatic impact of global warming on the local offshore wind potential. Dynamically downscaled wind data obtained by an edge-cutting fine-resolution regional climate model with two greenhouse-gases Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios 8.5 and 4.5 were biased-corrected with a quantile mapping method before using for assessment. Results revealed a changing trend of the annual-mean offshore wind speed and power potential in Vietnam under both scenarios. However, the change is seasonally asymmetric with decreases of about 2 â€“ 10% in September-October-November and slight increases of about 2 â€“ 4% in December-January-February. The turbine-based assessment showed that the cumulative annual energy obtained from the 12 MW and 8 MW turbines could reach the highest about 50.9 GWh and 30.7 GWh (2080â€“2099 average under scenario RCP8.5) but the difference in their capacity factor is much smaller, suggesting that turbine 8 MW should be considered in the sense of cost-effectiveness in some areas.

This is due to their small size and relatively high power capacity. These machines mostly are used as the vessels auxiliary engines and as emergency energy supplier. Last decade we can see a trend of high speed diesel use as main engines, particularly for vessels with diesel- electric power propulsion. Last accidents revealed that number of the engines damages appear without any symptom. Available information shows that significant number of accidents is caused by malfunction and defects in cylinder pack (liner, piston, cylinder head). To prevent drastic consequences, detection of abnormalities in the early stage is extremely important {[}3-5]. Our research during four years was focused on AE method implementation for the engine condition monitoring.

AB  - The ocean occupy nearly three-quarters of the earth's surface and represent an enormous source of renewable energy. While many of the world's industrialized nations have conducted exploratory research and development, the total power currently available from ocean energy systems, with the exception of the French tidal power plant, is less than one hundred megawatts (MW). An increasing number of ocean energy conversion systems are approaching an acceptable stage of development for commercial utilization. This paper considers the factors which are the most important in the design and development of ocean energy resource systems. Sources of renewable energy in the marine environment include tides, waves, currents, and thermal gradients. The challenge is to balance the energy resource potential with sources of environmental loading, which are applicable to a specific site, in the most logical and coherent manner possible, in order to make wise choices regarding site selection and system design.

IS  - NA
AB  - The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has set a target to reduce the carbon intensity of shipping, or CO2 emissions per transport work, by at least 40% by 2030 from 2008 levels. While short-term measures which focus on improving energy efficiency have been implemented, their impact on carbon intensity trends of international shipping over time has not been quantified. This study quantifies and attributes the contribution of various driving factors to the overall change in carbon intensity of international shipping by ship type. The carbon intensity changes of each ship type are quantitatively linked to the overall carbon intensity target of the IMO. The study results highlight that reductions in carbon intensity at the ship-type and global level have been largely a result of decreases in energy intensity from 2012 to 2018 but reductions became smaller in the later period (2015â€“2018), underscoring the limits to energy efficiency measures. Furthermore, this study highlights the additional insights that can be drawn on the transport mode and freight activity profiles from the joint analysis of demand and supply-side indicators, revealing not only the changes in freight activity and capacity utilization, but also the shifts in capacity miles travelled for different shipping modes.

TI  - Seaweed afforestation at large-scales exclusively for carbon sequestration: Critical assessment of risks, viability and the state of knowledge
JO  - Frontiers In Marine Science
PY  - 2022
VL  - 9
IS  - NA
AB  - There have been discussions of scaling up offshore seaweed cultivation and sinking it exclusively for carbon sequestration (â€˜ocean afforestationâ€™) and thereby help mitigate climate change, but is this concept feasible? Here we investigate the feasibility of ocean afforestation across five perspectives: 1) Ecological feasibility; 2) Technical feasibility; 3) Economic feasibility; 4) Co-benefits and risks; and 5) Governance and social considerations. Optimising ecological factors such as species selection and use of currents, alongside the use of low-cost biodegradable rafts in theory could see this concept scaled globally. An area of 400,000km2 or 16.4 billion biodegradable rafts would be needed for 1 gigatonne of CO2 fixation given roughly 16 rafts of 25m2 each would be needed per tonne of CO2 fixation. However, CO2 fixation (calculated from net primary productivity) and carbon sequestration (carbon permanently removed from the atmosphere) are fundamentally different processes, yet this distinction is often overlooked. Quantifying carbon sequestration from ocean afforestation remains elusive given several outstanding oceanic biogeochemical considerations. For example, the displacement of phytoplankton communities and their associated carbon sequestration via nutrient reallocation is a critical knowledge gap in understanding the climate change mitigation potential of ocean afforestation. Ocean afforestation also carries complex risks to marine ecosystems, for example, the impact on benthic communities of seaweed deposition. Additionally, governance and social challenges exist such as the legality of operation in relation to ocean treaties. The concept of ocean afforestation is still in its infancy, and while there are large research gaps, further investment into research should be given before the concept can be adequately compared against the suite of potential ocean-based climate change mitigation strategies.

JO  - Ocean And Coastal Management
PY  - 2015
VL  - 113

AB  - The expansion of shrimp aquaculture in Sri Lanka over the past three decades has dramatically changed the coastal landscape, in particular by converting mangrove forests. The current study quantified these impacts in the Puttalam lagoon, an area of the country that has experienced some of the most destructive development. Land use change was analysed using a multi-temporal set of aerial and satellite images taken in 1992/1994 (aerial photographs), 2007 (SPOT 5) and 2012 (Pleiades). The area of shrimp farms increased by 2777% over this 19-year period, with salt pans expanding by 60%. Mangroves declined in area by 34% and coconut groves increased by 17%. Because of problems with disease many intensive shrimp farms are abandoned after a few years, leaving denuded and unproductive landscapes; here a large majority of farms (90% of the total area of shrimp aquaculture) were found to be abandoned. The loss of carbon sequestration and storage services caused by this unsustainable recent history of shrimp farming was calculated as one measure of environmental impact. The documented land use changes in Puttalam lagoon resulted in an estimated net carbon loss of 191584tC. This was mainly due to conversion of mangroves to shrimp farms, making up 75.5% of the total carbon loss. These results demonstrate the scale of environmental degradation caused by intensive shrimp farming in the study area, and highlight the need for an entirely new aquaculture model in Sri Lanka.

AB  - Ocean acidification is impacting marine life all over the world. Understanding how species can cope with the changes in seawater carbonate chemistry represents a challenging issue. We addressed this topic using underwater CO2 vents that naturally acidify some marine areas off the island of Ischia. In the most acidified area of the vents, having a mean pH value of 6.7, comparable to far-future predicted acidification scenarios (by 2300), the biomass is dominated by the brown alga Sargassum vulgare. The novelty of the present study is the characterization of the S. vulgare proteome together with metabolite analyses to identify the key proteins, metabolites, and pathways affected by ocean acidification. A total of 367 and 387 proteins were identified in populations grown at pH that approximates the current global average (8.1) and acidified sites, respectively. Analysis of their relative abundance revealed that 304 proteins are present in samples from both sites: 111 proteins are either higher or exclusively present under acidified conditions, whereas 120 proteins are either lower or present only under control conditions. Functionally, under acidification, a decrease in proteins related to translation and post-translational processes and an increase of proteins involved in photosynthesis, glycolysis, oxidation-reduction processes, and protein folding were observed. In addition, small-molecule metabolism was affected, leading to a decrease of some fatty acids and antioxidant compounds under acidification. Overall, the results obtained by proteins and metabolites analyses, integrated with previous transcriptomic, physiological, and biochemical studies, allowed us to delineate the molecular strategies adopted by S. vulgare to grow in future acidified environments, including an increase of proteins involved in energetic metabolism, oxidation-reduction processes, and protein folding at the expense of proteins involved in translation and post-translational processes.

AB  - While multiple species of macroalgae and seagrass can benefit from elevated CO2 concentrations, competition between such organisms may influence their ultimate responses. This study reports on experiments performed with a Northwest Atlantic species of the macroalgae, Ulva, and the seagrass, Zostera marina, grown under ambient and elevated levels of pCO(2), and subjected to competition with each other. When grown individually, elevated pCO(2) significantly increased growth rates and productivity of Ulva and Zostera, respectively, beyond control treatments (by threefold and 27\%, respectively). For both primary producers, significant declines in tissue C-13 signatures suggested that increased growth and productivity were associated with a shift from use of HCO3- toward CO2 use. When grown under higher pCO(2), Zostera experienced significant increases in leaf and rhizome carbon content as well as significant increases in leaf carbon-to-nitrogen ratios, while sediments within which high CO(2)Zostera were grown had a significantly higher organic carbon content. When grown in the presence of Ulva; however, above- and below-ground productivity and tissue nitrogen content of Zostera were significantly lower, revealing an antagonistic interaction between elevated CO2 and the presence of Ulva. The presence of Zostera had no significant effect on the growth of Ulva. Collectively, this study demonstrates that while Ulva and Zostera can each individually benefit from elevated pCO(2) levels, the ability of Ulva to grow more rapidly and inhibit seagrass productivity under elevated pCO(2), coupled with accumulation of organic C in sediments, may offset the potential benefits for Zostera within high CO2 environments.

AB  - According to various environmental impact assessments, ocean-going vessels as the most important part of the maritime transportation industry will have increasing influence on the global ecosystem in near future. From the navigational and marine hydro-dynamical point of view, the accurate calculation or at least reliable estimation of attainable ship speed at actual sea is essential both from economic and environmental aspects. Reliable ship speed loss estimation under real environmental conditions allows a more accurate prediction of the power increase and fuel consumption as well as gas emissions from ships. On the other hand, technological enhancements like improved hull designs as well as improvement in power and propulsion systems could potentially reduce CO2 emission up to 35\%. These measures could effectively be combined with several other operational measures, such as optimal weather routing and voyage planning for ships, in order to ensure that fuel consumption and CO2 emissions from ships are minimized on every voyage. An appropriate strategy for greener shipping based on aforementioned approaches is proposed in this paper.

AB  - Accurate and reliable phase-resolved prediction of ocean surface waves is crucial for many offshore operations in ocean engineering and marine science. One important application is in optimal control of a power take-off in a wave energy converter, leading to significantly higher power production. Our interest is the forecasting of wave fields based on measurements obtained from multiple upwave locations in moderate seas with small directional spreading angles, such as is prevalent along the south coast of Australia. The prediction model, based on FFTs and propagation of waves according to the linear dispersion relation, is applied to both wave groups and irregular wave fields generated in a wave basin and, additionally, to ocean waves measured with drifting wave buoys. To account for spreading, the model numerically advances linear, plane (i.e. long-crested) waves in space at an optimum offset angle equal to the underlying seastate root-mean-square spreading angle. Averaging predictions based on a few slightly separated measurement locations, each weighted according to the estimated variance of the individual prediction, is shown to be more accurate than that from any single location. We also assess in detail the effect of drifting-buoy measurements in both long-crested and short-crested seas using synthetic wave records and show that it is possible to satisfactorily reconstruct the signal at fixed points based on the Doppler shift felt by the drifting buoy. The reconstructed signals give much better predictions compared to those completely neglecting the effect of even rather slow drift. Â© 2022 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

AB  - This paper proposes a road map for the integration of renewable energy supply to power subsea processing systems. To replace the traditional power supply, like fossil fuel-based generators or grid power, a wind turbine generator (WTG) operating on a islanded mode has been introduced and discussed. A review of the state of the art of WTGs is performed, primarily focused on power and controls aspects, with identification of the main technological gaps left to achieve wind-powered subsea processing. To fully assess the renewable energy integration and current gaps, a study case is proposed which addresses a subsea compression train powered by offshore wind. A thorough analysis is conducted, with meteorological conditions based on the NCS (Norwegian Continental Shelf), where gas line packing is proposed as an innovative means of energy storage. Finally, an economic analysis as well as a CO2 emission estimate is presented to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed road map. Some further discussions and conclusions are presented as well as some propositions for future works. Â© 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers

IS  - 6
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a key technology for addressing global warming by capturing carbon dioxide and storing it somewhere, usually underground. The transportation of CO2 is required since storage sites are not necessarily present near the source sites. Ships can be used for long distance transport of CO2. However, CO2 sources are not always located near the coast; hence onshore transportation may be required in addition to ship for transportation of CO2 from source sites to storage site. Liquefaction is a vital component in ship transportation. In this study, a state-of-the-art CO2 liquefaction processes have been designed by taking CO2 capture facilities into account. The proposed processes require lower liquefaction energy compared to other processes found in the literature. Suitable thermodynamic conditions are required for economical transport of CO2. Therefore, three scenarios each for post-combustion and pre-combustion have been studied in order to explore the effect of thermodynamic conditions on the economics of CO2 transport. The considered scenarios are categorized on the basis of liquefaction plant location as: (i) the capture site, liquefaction plant and shipping terminal are located close to each other; (ii) the capture site and liquefaction plant are far from shipping terminal; (iii) the capture site is far from liquefaction plant and shipping terminal. The scenarios results were useful for deciding the optimum liquefaction plant location. Finally, an economic analysis is performed in order to evaluate the feasibility of CO2 transport from source sites to ship loading terminal.

JO  - NANA
PY  - 2007
VL  - 6527
IS  - NA
AB  - A novel class of vibration-based electrical energy generators is presented for applications in which the input rotary speed is relatively low and varies significantly over time such as wind mills, turbo-machinery used to harvest tidal flows, and the like. Current technology uses magnet and coil based rotary generators to generate electrical energy in such machinery. However, to make the generation cycle efficient, gearing or other similar mechanisms have to be used to increase the output speed. In addition, variable speed mechanisms are usually needed to achieve high mechanical to electrical energy conversion efficiency since speed variation is usually significant in the aforementioned applications. The objective of the present work is the development of electrical energy generators that do not require the aforementioned gearing and speed control mechanisms, thereby significantly reducing complexity and cost, particularly those related to maintenance and service. This novel class of electrical energy generators operates based on repeated vibration of multiple vibrating elements that are tuned to vibrate at a fixed prescribed frequency. The mechanical energy stored in the vibration elements is transformed into electrical energy using piezoelectric elements. The present generators are very simple, can efficiently operate over a very large range of input speeds, and should require minimal service and maintenance. The project is at the early stages of its development, but the analytical modeling and computer simulation studies using realistic system and component parameters indicate the potentials of this class of piezoelectric-based generators for the indicated applications.

AB  - Mangroves are highly productive blue carbon ecosystems that preserve high organic carbon concentrations in soils. In this study, particle size, bulk elemental composition and stable carbon isotope were determined for the sediment cores collected from the landward and seaward sides of two mangrove forests of different ages (M1, ca. 60; M2, ca. 4 years old) to determine the effects of geomorphic setting and age (L1 = old mangrove and S1 = salt marsh stand in M1; L2 = young mangrove and S2 = bare mudflat in M2) on sediments and organic carbon accumulation. The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of the northernmost human-planted mangroves in China to accumulate sediment and carbon. Our results showed that fine-grained materials were preserved well in the interior part of the mangroves, and the capacity to capture fine-grained materials increased as the forest aged. The biogeochemical properties (C/N: 5.9 to 10.8; Î´13 C: âˆ’21.60â€° to âˆ’26.07â€°) indicated that the local organic carbon pool was composed of a mixture of autochthonous and allochthonous sources. Moreover, the accumulation of organic carbon increased with the forest age. The interior part of the old mangrove had the highest organic carbon stock (81.93 Mg Corg haâˆ’1). These findings revealed that mangrove reforestation had positive effects on sediments and organic carbon accretion. Â© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

VL  - 92

AB  - Human activities are responsible for a > 45 \% rise of atmospheric CO2 since the industrial revolution started; burning of fossil fuels being the largest source. Via accelerated weathering of limestone (AWL), CO2 can be captured from effluent gas streams and stored in the marine environment primarily in the form of bicarbonate. We studied the CO2 storage capacity and how AWL-derived water impacts the carbonate chemistry of the southern North Sea. Therefor, a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model was coupled with a sub-module to model the carbonate chemistry. We studied three scenarios: 1) scrubbing effluent gas streams of a combined heat and power plant (60 kW), 2) scrubbing 10 \% or 3) 100 \% of the flue gas of a coal-fired power plant (750 MW). Whereas, impacts on seawater carbonate chemistry due to AWL discharge were imperceptible in the first scenario, a maximum change in pH(T) and calcite saturation state of 0.1 and 0.6 was found in scenario 2. In scenario 3, the decrease in pH(T) exceeded 1 around the discharge site and the calcite saturation state reached 8 in large parts of the Jade Bay, posing the possibility of significant impacts on the marine ecosystem. Abiotic precipitation of calcite might occur around the discharge site. In all three scenarios, 50 \% of the captured CO2 re-entered the atmosphere after the simulated time period of one year. This study shows that care is needed in siting, sizing and operating AWL facilities to maximize climate and ocean ecosystem benefits while minimizing negative environmental impacts.

JO  - Oecologia
PY  - 1999
VL  - 119
IS  - 1
AB  - The ecosystem-level carbon uptake and respiration were measured under different CO2 concentrations in the tropical rainforest and the coastal desert of Biosphere 2, a large enclosed facility. When the mesocosms were sealed and subjected to step-wise changes in atmospheric CO2 between daily means of 450 and 900 Î¼mol mol-1, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 was derived using the diurnal changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The step-wise CO2 treatment was effectively replicated as indicated by the high repeatability of NEE measurements under similar CO2 concentrations over a 12-week period. In the rainforest mesocosm, daily NEE was increased significantly by the high CO2 treatments because of much higher enhancement of canopy CO2 assimilation relative to the increase in the nighttime ecosystem respiration under high CO2. Furthermore, the response of daytime NEE to increasing atmospheric CO2 in this mesocosm was not linear, with a saturation concentration of 750 Î¼mol mol-1. In the desert mesocosm, a combination of a reduction in ecosystem respiration and a small increase in canopy CO2 assimilation in the high CO2 treatments also enhanced daily NEE. Although soil respiration was not affected by the short-term change in atmospheric CO2 in either mesocosm, plant dark respiration was increased significantly by the high CO2 treatments in the rainforest mesocosm while the opposite was found in the desert mesocosm. The high CO2 treatments increased the ecosystem light compensation points in both mesocosms. High CO2 significantly increased ecosystem radiation use efficiency in the rainforest mesocosm, but had a much smaller effect in the desert mesocosm. The desert mesocosm showed much lower absolute response in NEE to atmospheric CO2 than the rainforest mesocosm, probably because of, the presence of C4 plants. This study illustrates the importance of large-scale experimental research in the study of complex global change issues.

JO  - Renewable Energy
PY  - 2021
VL  - 180

AB  - Renewable energy technologies (RETs), particularly solar and wind energy technologies, have experienced a rapid decline in their costs over the last two decades. Several studies claim that RETs are cost-competitive with fossil fuel technologies based on their levelized costs of electricity (LCOE), the most common indicator used to compare the cost competitiveness of electricity-generating technologies. However, no consensus exists due to the wide variations in factors influencing the LCOEs across countries and technologies. This study calculates more than 4000 LCOEs for 11 technologies, varying all input variables. It shows that the LCOEs for RETs, except concentrated solar and offshore wind, are lower than those for fossil fuel technologies at the lower range of capital costs and discount rates of 10% or lower. However, for a reasonable range of input variables, the study cannot justify the low auction prices for solar power, below US$20/MWh, recently observed in some parts of the world. The study illustrates how various factors influence the cost of electricity generation across technologies. It also compares the trends in electricity generation costs between RETs and fossil fuels over the last two decades. Â© 2021

AB  - The main purposes of investigating the generation of the rogue waves in offshore engineering include: 1) prediction of its occurrence to protect the offshore structure from attacking; 2) the experimental investigation of rogue waves/structure interaction for the structure design. The latter one calls high requirement of wave generation and calculation. In this paper, we establish a spatial domain model of fourth order nonlinear SchrÃ¶dinger (NLS) equation for describing deep-water wave trains in moving coordinate system. For the first purpose mentioned above, this paper presents the evolution of random wave trains in real sea state described by the Joint North Sea Wave Project (JONSWAP) power spectrum numerically, which is governed by the NLS equation. The parameters of the spectrum are evaluated to discuss their effect on the occurrence of rogue waves. For the second purpose to generate rogue waves in experimental tank efficiently, the transient wave is focused for its allowance of precise determination of concentration place/time. First we simulate the three-dimensional transient waves in the numerical tank modeling the deepwater basin with double-side multi-segmented wave-maker in Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) with linear superposing theory. To discuss its nonlinearity for the guidance of experiment, the transient wave is set as the initial condition of the NLS equation and the difference from the linear simulation is presented, which could be given as the suggestion to the preparation of experiment.

JO  - Estuarine Coastal And Shelf Science
PY  - 2020
VL  - 238
IS  - NA
AB  - The tide plays a crucial role in maintaining the carbon sink strength in salt marsh ecosystems. Furthermore, the effects of tides on ecosystem carbon exchange could vary with different timescales. Using the eddy covariance technique combined with wavelet analysis, we analyzed the time-frequency characteristics of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) to address the tidal effects on NEE at multiple timescales. The wavelet analysis showed that NEE displayed a tidal-driven pattern with distinct characteristics at the multiday scale (i.e., 8-16 days) and the seasonal scale (i.e., 64-128 days). Moreover, a more significant controlling effect of light rather than air temperature on NEE was found at the diel scale. Tides also affected the variation of the diurnal pattern of NEE. Tidal flooding inhibited nighttime CO2 emissions (NEEnighttime) as well as decreased temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of NEEnighttime from 1.37 to 1.16. In contrast, the response of daytime NEE (NEEdaytime) to tidal activities was more complicated, as the NEEdaytime reacted differently with different months during the growing season. Overall, our findings can contribute to a better understanding of tidal effects on ecosystem carbon exchange in salt marshes.

In this perspective, we delineate next-generation biotechnologies for CCSU supported by engineering design principles derived from ecological processes inspired by three major biomes (plant-soil, deep biosphere, and marine). These are to interface with existing industrial infrastructure and, in some cases, tap into the carbon sink potential of nature. To develop ecosystem-inspired biotechnology, it is important to identify accessible control points of CO2 and CH4 within a given system as well as value-chain opportunities that drive innovation. In essence, we must supplement natural biogeochemical carbon sinks with new bioengineering solutions.

JO  - Renewable Energy
PY  - 2020

IS  - NA
AB  - Oscillating water column (OWC) device is one of the most promising wave energy converters (WECs). Besides the energy conversion efficiency, the survivability should also be considered for a design purpose in the process of wave energy exploitation. In the present study, by introducing the artificial viscous terms into the dynamic free surface boundary condition and Bernoulli equation, a fully nonlinear numerical model based on higher-order boundary element method (HOBEM) is adopted to model the wave dynamics of an OWC device. The viscosity effects on the wave force (i.e., Î”F) is investigated by comparing the predicted wave force by the numerical model with and without these viscous terms. The effects of the chamber geometry parameters, such as front wall draft, chamber width and opening ratio (i.e., air orifice width), on Î”F are investigated. The results indicate that the viscosity effect on the wave force on the seaside surface of the front wall is larger than that on its shoreside surface. The viscosity effect on the total horizontal wave force on the front wall increases with the increase of front wall draft in some extent. The influence of the viscosity on the horizontal wave force increases with opening ratio decreasing due to the increasing air pressure inside the chamber. Â© 2020 The Authors

AB  - Three sheep, a foal, a pony, and a calf were anesthetized and ventilated for short periods, using a high-frequency oscillatory ventilator. The efficiency of CO2 elimination was characterized at various oscillatory frequencies (50 to 30 Hz) and various tidal volumes, although the tidal volume used was always less than the measured dead space of the animal. In general, increasing either the oscillatory frequency or tidal volume increased CO2 elimination, but increasing the tidal volume had more effect. The relationship between these 3 variables was best described by a power law equation. Ventilatory frequencies and tidal volumes required to maintain eucapnia in the species studied were extrapolated from the results and, when technically possible, the potential of the technique to maintain eucapnia was tested in extended runs. The animals were supported successfully over this period, with normal blood gas tensions and no detrimental effects to heart rate and rhythm or arterial blood pressure.

TI  - Are shore power and emission control area policies always effective together for pollutant emission reduction? â€“ An analysis of their joint impacts at the post-pandemic era
JO  - Ocean And Coastal Management
PY  - 2022
VL  - 224
IS  - NA
AB  - Shore power (SP) and emission control area (ECA) have been two of the main polices for a green maritime logistics. However, it is still not clear how the joint impact of these two polices will influence vessels' shipping and energy consumption plan. The influence could be more complicated at the post-pandemic era of COVID-19 when the vessel's refueling could be risky. This paper develops mathematical model of the vessel's routing and fuel inventory decisions by considering both the SP and ECA. Based on the model, we analyze the optimal decision of a vessel under three different policy conditions, which are non-SP, compulsive utilization of SP at all ports, and optional SP utilization by the vessel. The numerical experiments are conducted based on the information of a vessel delivering cargos along the coastline in China. The results uncover a novel phenomenon that the implementation of the SP might incentive the vessel to travel longer distance outside the ECA for a lower total cost that results in more pollutant emissions. We show that the SP policy would influence the vessel's fuel management and refueling times which can change the route of vessel sailing inside and outside ECAs. Sensitivity analysis also shed light on how the government's decision on the SP policy may influence the overall pollutant emissions of the vessel from both berthing at ports and sailing on the sea. We discussed how the fixed cost of refueling, which is affected by the risk of the COVID-19 condition, will influence the vessel's plan under the SP and ECA polices. This study suggests the government to make an integrated policy of both SP and ECA at the post-pandemic era to achieve an overall reduction of the pollutant emission. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Energy efficiency measures are a priority in the near term to reduce the carbon intensity of maritime sector in the next years. Since 2017, IMO has been proposing policies to rapidly promote the adoption of cleaner technologies and fuels for oceangoing vessels. Lithium-ion batteries have been recently installed onboard smaller scale ferries and passenger vessels either as the primary energy source, or then as a hybrid solution. Various lithium-ion battery chemistries are available, with sources pointing at lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide as the most feasible solution for ships. In this Chapter (Section 5.2), the authors focus their attention on the design, modeling, and control of maritime batteries, presenting and discussing real-life applications on sizing, modeling and control. Thermal energy storage (TES) technologies are focused on mismatching the gap between the energy production and consumption by recovering surplus energy during the generation to be used on periods of high demand. Although large amount of studies cover the application of TES technology in fields like renewable energies or industrial applications, very few authors evaluated the use of TES systems in ships to increase the efficiency of the engines and reduce their CO2 emissions. In Section 5.3, an analysis of the potential use of TES systems is presented, considering the heat and cold sources in different types of ships, and its use on board. Potential drawbacks of the use of TES on board ships, such as the integration with existing propulsion layouts, the requirements of weight and volume, are also discussed. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Nowadays it is important to consider sustainable factors in maritime shipping. This is because they are resulting in higher greenhouse effect. One of the factors is fuel emission that may lead to more carbon dioxide emission. In order to reduce fuel emission, one possible way is to optimize vessel speed, but this method may lead to lower service level. Trading off those conflicting relationships is important for planners. Therefore, many existing literatures focus on modelling this problem to be similar to the real world situation and the algorithm that provides the optimal speed within reasonable time. However, in practice, the decision makers also need a decision support system that helps them obtain the optimal speed. Thus, this paper presents a decision support system that seeks to suggest the speed in balancing fuel emission with service level for marine shipping.

AB  - The Offshore Mediterranean Conference (OMC) in Ravenna discussed efforts to breathe new life into old oil and gas platforms, such as refitting for renewable energy, while also cutting CO2 emissions and cost. Italian Economic Development Minister Ivan Scalfarotto said that facilities off the Adriatic coast could be reused for wind and solar energy, or for monitoring the marine environment, seismic, tourism or wireless transmission. Liv Hovem, senior vice president Africa and Europe, DNV GL Oil &amp; Gas at OMC, said that by taking various measures, oil and gas firms could reduce their CO2 footprints cost effectively, on average, by 29%. DNV GL has produced a tool to assess the opportunities, using what it calls a marginal abatement curve (MAC). This considers the cost per ton of CO2 of a measure and the overall CO2 emission reduction. One option is to use floating wind turbines to power subsea facilities, such as subsea water injection, specifically. DNV GL completed a feasibility study, with input from ExxonMobil, Eni and Statoil, on such a concept, based on a site in the North Sea. DNV GL targeted a 44,000 b/d concept, which would traditionally require a 3MW gas turbine on a platform. Ben Oudman, DNV GL also highlighted a project to create an offshore energy hub, which would involve creating artificial islands, supporting offshore wind, as a transmission hub and a platform, as well as fish farming, pumped hydro-storage, and power-to-gas.

JO  - Renewable \& Sustainable Energy Reviews
PY  - 2021
VL  - 148

AB  - Emissions reduction targets are pushing the shipping industry towards cleaner and more energy-efficient solutions. One option proposed is to replace conventional marine fuels with cleaner fuels. This is particularly important for vessels engaged in short-sea shipping and inland waterway transportation because their exhaust gases more negatively affect the local population than long-distance ships do. Hence the aim of this study is to undertake a technical, environmental and economic analysis of alternative fuels to reduce the environmental footprint and lifetime costs of inland waterway transportation. The analysis will focus on Croatia whose existing outdated inland waterway fleet needs to meet the goals of the Low-Carbon Development Strategy of the Republic of Croatia. In the study, a life-cycle analysis and life-cycle cost assessment of different alternative fuels will be performed taking into account the operating profiles and technical characteristics of vessels working in Croatia. The potential effects of a carbon tax are also examined in a case study considering carbon emissions reduction targets in Croatia by 2030. The electrification of ships is highlighted as the most environmentally friendly option for each considered ship, reaching a carbon emission reduction of up to 51\%, while the most cost-effective option varies for each ship.

AB  - For owners of large ocean-going vessels entering a period of economic uncertainty in 2009, climate change may be far from their minds with uncertain bunker fuel costs and uncertain rates contributing to declining profit margins. Yet, despite the gloom, recession may be the catalyst that leads shipping to grasp the exasperation and turn itself green. One of the main drivers of climate change is the aviation industry, while the maritime industry had cruised under the radar of scrutiny for many years - until recently. It seems ironic that as the world reaches its peak oil production before fossil fuel options begin to decline, the shipping industry will have to pay more in choosing cleaner fuels just for the chance to struggle with other demand sources for the chance to purchase more expensive fuel. According to one of the world's leading shipping companies, APL, shipyards can build ships designed for greater efficiency and put in engines, which burn fuel more efficiently and pollute less. However, APL failed to take the initiative to do so. While the IMO continues to consider and go on over potential solutions to CO2 and shipowners fret over higher fuel costs, it is worth pointing out that those solutions already exist, indeed some have been around for many years. There are technologies that are also now available, ready to be employed immediately, and with proven results. These include DK Group's Air Cavity System, wind power, fuel additives, twin propellers, new propeller blades, recovering the waste gas heat. All of which can reduce emissions by up 30% in the container trade and 50% in tankers and bulk trade.

VL  - 59
IS  - 5
AB  - Shallow coastal waters serve an important role as long-term carbon (C) sinks because they capture terrestrial C and retain internally produced C in wetlands and sediments. We show that tropical cyclones (TCs) can lead to rapid CO2 efflux from estuaries, driven by physical and biogeochemical perturbation of these coastal C reservoirs, and that the magnitude of TC-driven CO2 emissions may offset C that accumulates over much longer timescales. In August 2011, Hurricane Irene passed over North Carolina's Neuse River Estuary-Pamlico Sound (NRE-PS), which is part of the second largest estuarine system in the U.S., the Albemarle-Pamlico Sound. Irene rapidly changed the NRE-PS system from a small CO2 sink to a large CO2 source. Irene-induced CO2 efflux from the NRE alone was at least four times the annual riverine C input and seven times the annual atmospheric CO2 uptake. The magnitude and duration of ecosystem disturbance from TCs vary with storm intensity and frequency but likely are qualitatively similar across many terrestrial and coastal systems. Consequently, altered TC activity under future climate scenarios may shift the balance between C accumulation in, and release from, coastal C reservoirs.

AB  - Although transportation has major energy and environmental policy implications, not all sectors are treated equally, and ships often are overlooked. However, ships are a significant source of air pollution and account for a nontrivial portion of U.S. petroleum demand. Moderate emissions standards for new marine engines have been proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency, but these will take well over a decade to become effective once they are enacted, and there are no energy policy provisions for ships. Nonetheless, ships offer cost-effective options for both emissions reductions and the use of alternative fuels. Aware of these issues, the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Transportation Technologies and the Gas Research Institute sponsored a study of the potential use of natural gas as the fuel for passenger ferries as part of their Natural Gas Vehicle Technology Initiative. The results of the study are discussed, with a focus on the energy and environmental issues related to maritime operations in the United States. The challenges and opportunities of a specific project to design, construct, and operate several natural gas-powered ferries in Boston Harbor are discussed. A significant reduction in air pollution and a large increase in the use of natural gas as a transportation fuel are expected from this project, but the greenhouse gas emission impacts are ambiguous. Further, an emissions monitoring and analysis program is described that would greatly improve the accuracy of maritime emissions inventories and would enable ships to take part in existing emissions trading programs in port cities around the country. Such a development would create significant economic incentives to encourage ferry owners to invest in clean fuel technologies, which could have major implications for energy and environmental policy.

As wind farm development is very likely in the Mediterranean Sea, we provide an assessment of the offshore wind potential and identify expected biological effects of such developments in the region. We break new ground here by identifying potential offshore wind farm (OWF) ``hotspots{''} in the Mediterranean. Using lessons learned in Northern Europe, and small-scale experiments in the Mediterranean, we identify sensitive species and habitats that will likely be influenced by OWFs in both these hotspot areas and at a basin level. This information will be valuable to guide policy governing OWF development and will inform the industry as and when environmental impact assessments are required for the Mediterranean Sea.

JO  - Journal Of Environmental Monitoring
PY  - 2007
VL  - 9
IS  - 8
AB  - This Critical Review on environmental concerns of desalination plants suggests that planning and monitoring stages are critical aspects of successful management and operation of plants. The site for the desalination plants should be selected carefully and should be away from residential areas particularly for forward planning for possible future expansions. The concerning issues identified are noise pollution, visual pollution, reduction in recreational fishing and swimming areas, emission of materials into the atmosphere, the brine discharge and types of disposal methods used are the main cause of pollution. The reverse osmosis (RO) method is the preferred option in modern times especially when fossil fuels are becoming expensive. The RO has other positives such as better efficiency (30-50%) when compared with distillation type plants (10-30%). However, the RO membranes are susceptible to fouling and scaling and as such they need to be cleaned with chemicals regularly that may be toxic to receiving waters. The input and output water in desalination plants have to be pre and post treated, respectively. This involves treating for pH, coagulants, Cl, Cu, organics, CO2, H2S and hypoxia. The by-product of the plant is mainly brine with concentration at times twice that of seawater. This discharge also includes traces of various chemicals used in cleaning including any anticorrosion products used in the plant and has to be treated to acceptable levels of each chemical before discharge but acceptable levels vary depending on receiving waters and state regulations. The discharge of the brine is usually done by a long pipe far into the sea or at the coastline. Either way the high density of the discharge reaches the bottom layers of receiving waters and may affect marine life particularly at the bottom layers or boundaries. The longer term effects of such discharge concentrate has not been documented but it is possible that small traces of toxic substances used in the cleaning of RO membranes may be harmful to marine life and ecosystem. The plants require saline water and thus the construction of input and discharge output piping is vital. The piping are often lengthy and underground as it is in Tugun (QLD, Australia), passing below the ground. Leakage of the concentrate via cracks in rocks to aquifers is a concern and therefore appropriate monitoring quality is needed. Leakage monitoring devices ought to be attached to such piping during installation. The initial environment impact assessment should identify key parameters for monitoring during discharge processes and should recommend ongoing monitoring with devices attached to structures installed during construction of plants.

JO  - Proceedings Of The International Offshore And Polar Engineering Conference
PY  - 2017
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - The monopile foundation for an offshore wind turbine (OWT) has been successfully implemented worldwide, particularly in Germany, Denmark and the United Kingdom. Numerous offshore wind farms have been operational for a large percent of their expected service lives. However, one problematic area of concern is that the transition zone of the structure (the connection between the monopile and tower) relies on a grouted connection which fails to support the axial load of the OWT when it is subjected to wind and wave loadings. This is a major implication for offshore wind farms that are installed and, thereby requires a retrofit solution that is not only adequately-effective, but also efficiently implemented. This paper analyzes a retrofit solution that involves drilling holes through the transition piece, grout, and monopile and installing pins, which would completely prevent vertical movement between the transition piece and monopile. The NREL 5MW reference wind turbine was considered for this study, atop a monopile with a 5m diameter. To adequately address the major issue presented, this study consists of three simulation parts. All three parts implemented a finite element model (FEM) analysis of the transition zone to: 1) simulate the transition zone without any additional supports types (e.g. shear keys); 2) simulate the transition zone with the support of shear keys; and 3) simulate the transition zone with the retrofit pins without the implementation of shear keys. These pins will be spaced based on a general following of the DNV guidelines for shear key design. All three of the models are local models only, and thus have simplified loading conditions applied. Each model is 25m tall and are assumed to be fixed at the base. The retrofit solution will then be compared to the other cases to determine its efficacy in transcending the grout-failure problem. From this study it is anticipated that an effective retrofit solution will be simulated for a general OWT size. Copyright Â© 2017 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).

AB  - Aquatic floating plants on BioHaven mats were tested for their potential use as a Best Management Practice to be incorporated within existing stormwater detention ponds. Plants were analyzed for their capability to remove nutrient-pollution in parallel with the study of ecological dynamics. Experiments were carried out in cylindrical mesocosms of 5 m diameter and 1.2 m height, above-ground pools with a water volume of 14 m(3). The design parameters tested were for 5\% and 10\% vegetated floating island coverage of the mesocosm, both with and without shoreline plants called littoral zone. This littoral shelf was 0.5 m thick, graded at a downward slope of 1:5 toward the center using loamy soil with low organic matter content, excavated from below turf grass. Endemic plant species were chosen for the experimental location in central Florida based on a wetland identification manual by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to ensure the study was not compromised by unique climate requirements of the plants. Nutrient and aquatic chemical conditions such as pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, turbidity, and chlorophyll a were monitored to understand their relationships to the general wetland ecosystem. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis identified the microbial activity near the rhizospheric zone. Logistical placement considerations were made using spatial sampling across the horizontal plane of the mesocosms, beneath and around the root zone, to determine if nutrients tend to aggregate around the floating island. This study concluded that the application of floating islands as a stormwater technology can remove nutrients through plant uptake and biological activity. The most cost-effective size in the outdoor mesocosms was 5\% surface area coverage of the mat. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - CCS projects involve a complex legal mechanism. The IPCC (2005) clearly indicated that installations of CCS technology require â€˜long-term managementâ€™ by: ensuring careful site selection; monitoring systems; regulations; and remediation and liability measures. While a large volume of legal study on CCS has been undertaken, a variety of SEA and EIA and their possible mixed approaches are also being considered for designing an effective policy and legal framework for CCS (e.g. IEAGHG, 2007; and Koornneef et al. 2008, 2011). Yet, the best practice of the mixed approach to assisting a policy, legal and regulatory framework is unclear, due to the lack of experience and the varied levels of comprehension. Japan intends to commercialise CCS technology in the future. This paper provides an analysis of examining: whether the key roles and elements of SEA and EIA in response to long-term management are being covered in the current CCS law in Japan. The outcome of this study creates a novel framework of legal analysis, an application of the framework that articulate insights into Japan's legal issues, and a set of potentially useful lessons for the future design of policy and legal framework for CCS projects.

AB  - This paper presents a novel cluster-based approach for operation and control of multiterminal offshore high-voltage dc (HVDC) grids equipped with voltage source converter (VSC) technology. While conventional optimal power flow algorithms for ac transmission systems focus on minimizing generation costs, wind forecast uncertainties and future bulk power transfers preset by contracts between Transmission System Operators require new concepts for control of future offshore multiterminal dc (MTDC) grids. Based on already installed and future planned offshore wind farms in the North Sea, power generation of a wind farm for one time step using specific wind power curves including limited availability, wake effects and dynamic shut off as well as a method to allocate wind power plants to HVDC offshore converter stations are outlined. A sequential Newton Raphson acdc power flow algorithm was developed to cluster MTDC grids into different zones assuring an export of power from wind farm clusters to different control or market areas. The two main control objectives for MTDC grid operation are minimum grid transmission losses and fulfilment of guaranteed power transfers to specific market areas. To provide proof of the overall applicability, acdc power flow simulations were carried out on a specially developed future European Offshore Grid Scenario using real forecasted offshore wind speed data.

AB  - The study showed that the migration and transformation of marine carbon had a close relation with the biogeochemical processes driven by various chemical factors. The growth and decline of nutrient concentration, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), redox potential (Eh), SO4 2-, and sulfur potential (Es) could change marine chemical environment, and thus, affect the migration and transformation of marine carbon. When the nutrient supply was adequate to the nutritional demand of phytoplankton, CO2 was conveyed to deep sea through photosynthesis and organic matter oxidation, which caused the decrease of sea water PCO2 and the increase of sea-air CO2 flux and organic carbon output, making the sea area as a CO2 sink. But, the increasing acidification of marine environment caused by CO2 dissolution and organic matter degradation brought about the solubility augmentation of carbonate in seawater. Moreover, the mineralization of organic carbon was coupled with the changes of DO, Eh, SO42- and Es, and the deposition and burial process of carbon in sediments. In sea water body, high DO and high Eh accelerated the transformation from inorganic carbon to organic carbon, while in sediment, high SO42- was adverse to the burial of organism with low DO and low Eh.

JO  - Environmental Research Letters
PY  - 2016
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
AB  - As long as global CO2 emissions continue to increase annually, long-term committed Earth system changes grow much faster than current observations. A novel metric linking this future growth to policy decisions today is the mitigation delay sensitivity (MDS), but MDS estimates for Earth system variables other than peak temperature (Delta T-max) are missing. Using an Earth System Model of Intermediate Complexity, we show that the current emission increase rate causes a Delta T-max increase roughly 3-7.5 times as fast as observed warming, and a millenial steric sea level rise (SSLR) 7-25 times as fast as observed SSLR, depending on the achievable rate of emission reductions after the peak of emissions. These ranges are only slightly affected by the uncertainty range in equilibrium climate sensitivity, which is included in the above values. The extent of ocean acidification at the end of the century is also strongly dependent on the starting time and rate of emission reductions. The preservable surface ocean area with sufficient aragonite supersaturation for coral reef growth is diminished globally at an MDS of roughly 25\%-80\% per decade. A near-complete loss of this area becomes unavoidable if mitigation is delayed for a few years to decades. Also with respect to aragonite, 12\%-18\% of the Southern Ocean surface become undersaturated per decade, if emission reductions are delayed beyond 2015-2040. We conclude that the consequences of delaying global emission reductions are much better captured if the MDS of relevant Earth system variables is communicated in addition to current trends and total projected future changes.

AB  - With the development of China's offshore wind power, the peak shaving and operation of the power system in the eastern region, which are in a high proportion of power receiving and huge peak shaving demand for local power supply, face greater challenges. In the paper, on the basis of the quantitative analysis of the regulation characteristics of "source-grid-load", a "source-grid-load" coordinated operation strategy that takes into account environmental costs is proposed. It can improve the system's absorptive capacity and at the same time, it can cut the total operating cost of the system and improve the utilization of offshore wind power. In this way, the use of traditional fossil energy and its impact on the environment can be reduced. Taking the grid, as is scheduled in 2030, of a regional power grid as an example, the production and operation simulation and comparative analysis were carried out on the statistics before and after the coordinated operation of "source-grid-load". The results verified the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. Â© 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Man Diesel &amp; Turbo G-Type ultra long stroke marine diesel engine was introduced in October 2010.This ultra long stroke means it has been designed to have reduced engine speeds and there by achieving high efficiency ships with reduced fuel consumption as well as reduced CO2 emissions. The ultra long stroke diesel engine with capability of using large size propeller and there by engines with comparatively low speeds can be used for propulsions of large bulk carriers and oil tankers.

AB  - Nowadays, energy saving and emission reduction have aroused widespread concern in the maritime industry. Energy efficiency optimization is one of the effective ways to save energy and reduce emissions. Ship energy efficiency is synthetically influenced by multiple factors including environmental and operational profile. The randomness of these factors results in very complex interrelation among the environment and ship engine speed as well as ship energy efficiency. It is difficult for the semi-empirical or theoretical modeling methods to describe such interrelation accurately. The rapid development of big data analysis makes it possible to obtain the association rules of various environmental factors and ship energy efficiency as well as engine speed. In this paper, big data analyses in terms of Parallel Distributed K-Means Clustering (PDKC) algorithm and Parallel Frequent Pattern Mining (PFPM) algorithm are adopted to achieve the clustering analysis of ship energy efficiency related data, and to obtain the interrelation among ship energy efficiency and environmental factors as well as engine speed. On this basis, the knowledge base of ship energy efficiency accounting for various environmental factors is established. The constructed knowledge base can be used for exploring optimization methods of ship energy efficiency, promoting decision-making system development and contributing to energy saving and emission reduction of ships.

AB  - This research aims to determine the estimation of biomass, carbon stock, density, and CO2 absorption of true Mangrove stands This is important to know how much the area of the mangrove forest is able to absorb CO2 from the air, so that it can support the area's sustainable management activities in relation to reducing the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. The research method used is a quantitative descriptive method with purposive sampling data collection techniques. Based on the research results obtained 6 types of mangroves namely Sonneratia alba, Rhizophora gymnorhiza, Aegiceras corniculatum, Avicenia marina, Bruguiera gymnorhiza, and Xylocarpus granatum. Based on the calculation using allometric equations, biomass results were 277.945 tons/Ha, estimation of carbon stock was 127.855 tons/Ha, true mangrove stand density was 737 individuals/Ha, and total CO2 absorption of true Mangrove stands was 468.802 tons/Ha.

AB  - The first aim of the research presented here is to examine the effect of turbine control by comparing a passive open-loop control strategy with a constant rotational speed proportional-integral-derivative (PID) feedback loop control applied to the same experimental turbine. The second aim is to evaluate the effect of unsteady inflow on turbine performance by comparing results from a towing-tank, in the absence of turbulence, with results from the identical machine in a tidal test site. The results will also inform the reader of: (i) the challenges of testing tidal turbines in unsteady tidal flow conditions in comparison to the controlled laboratory environment; (ii) calibration of acoustic Doppler flow measurement instruments; (iii) characterising the inflow to a turbine and identifying the uncertainties from unsteady inflow conditions by adaptation of the International Electrotechnical Commission technical specification (IEC TS): 62600-200. The research shows that maintaining a constant rotational speed with a control strategy yields a 13.7% higher peak power performance curve in the unsteady flow environment, in comparison to an open-loop control strategy. The research also shows an 8.0% higher peak power performance in the lab compared to the field, demonstrating the effect of unsteady flow conditions on power performance. The research highlights the importance of a tidal turbines control strategy when designing experiments. Â© 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This paper presents wind speed shear exponents and turbulence intensity (TI) measurements collected from light imaging, detection, and ranging instruments (LiDARs) measuring wind speeds from 40 m to 200 m above sea level and provides comparisons to industry design guidelines. The high-altitude wind speed data are unique and represent some of the first measurements made offshore in this part of the country, which is actively being developed for offshore wind. The data are used to support the New England Aqua Ventus I Floating Offshore Wind Farm to be located 17 km offshore the Northeast United States. Multiple LiDAR measurements were made using a DeepCLiDAR floating buoy and LiDARs located on a nearby island. The measured wind speed shear exponents are compared against industry standard mesoscale model outputs and offshore design codes including the American Bureau of Shipping, American Petroleum Institute, and Det Norske Veritas-Germanischer Lloyd guides. Significant variation in the vertical wind speed profile occurs throughout the year which is not addressed in design standards. Additionally, TI measurements made from the LiDAR, although not widely accepted in the scientific community, are presented and compared against industry guidelines.

AB  - As global energy consumption continues to increase, the negative impact of global warming also grows. Therefore, eco-friendly energy policy is being established all over the world. Korea's energy consumption problems are further complicated by the country's high dependence on energy sourced overseas. Korean energy policy is evolving rapidly to address these problems. Korea has begun to phase out nuclear power and is focusing on developing new sources of renewable energy. So there has been substantial interest in the development of ocean energy. Of all ocean energy technologies, tidal current energy is the closest to the commercialization. Especially, the southwestern coast of Korea is the most promising candidate site for the development of tidal current energy owing to the abundant tidal current energy resource. Meanwhile, ocean energy policy is an important factor in determining the development of ocean energy. Thus, this paper presents the overview of the current status of policy and technology for the tidal current energy system in Korea. These policies explained in this paper can provide significant interest and motivation for the use of tidal current energy resources.

AB  - The shipping industry is an important source of greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrogen oxides. In the past few years, environmental and policy reasons dictate the immense reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in industries worldwide. Towards this direction, the shipping industry has focused on ship trim optimization in the last few years as an operational measure for better energy efficiency and thus a way to reduce consumption and energy-related emissions. In this paper, we present a machine learning solution to the problem of trim optimization. Specifically, we use Internet of Things (IoT) data for speed, draft, and trim in order to accurately predict shaft power. After our machine learning model is trained, we use its predicting capabilities to create the shaft power surface as part of the trim monitoring user interface of the maritime company infrastructure.

AB  - Ocean-going vessels calling on ports all around the world, in general, use on-board diesel engine-generator sets for hotel power supply requirements. These ships, when docked at the ports, consume hotel power produced by the same generators resulting in air pollution. Shutting off these on-board generators and supplying vessel hotel power from the shore can reduce the diesel fuel emissions. This process, when shore power is provided to the vessel auxiliaries by shutting down its on-board generators, is called cold ironing. This technology has been used by the military at naval bases for many decades when ships are docked for long periods. However, recently, as the world's vessel fleet is increasing at a steady pace, vessel calls at specific ports are becoming relatively more frequent In addition, vessel hotel power requirements have increased, and thus the concern of on-board generator emissions during docking periods has become an important air pollution issue. This paper describes electrical power system of a cold ironing project in which barge is used to mount a unit substation and cable management equipment. At present there are no industry standards for cold ironing power system design, especially the grounding of the floating ungrounded ship power supply system. This paper systems, highlights the mainfeatures of cold ironing power with emphasis on personnel and equipment protection by an adequate electrical grounding system.

We then modify Gaussian turbulence using multi-fractal fields and reproduce most of the observed non-Gaussianity. By using cubed velocities as a simplistic wind-turbine interaction model, we demonstrate how the turbulence intensity, integral length, and the intermittency seen in non-Gaussian turbulence make fingerprints on the turbine power. These fingerprints are to some extend verified by comparing measured power with simulated power using a wind-turbine interaction simulator. Â© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

AB  - The British government has approved construction of the $56 million Wave Hub, a deep-sea electricity "socket" that will sit on the seabed 10 mi off the Cornish coast and link as many as 30 wave energy machines to the UK electricity grid. The project, to be located in waters about 150 feet deep, will enable wave energy developers to "plug in" and test the efficiency and durability of their machines, which convert the kinetic energy of waves to electricity. Plans call for the Wave Hub to be connected to the UK grid by a 15-mi undersea cable that will come ashore at a substation at Hayle, in southwest England. Wave Hub could deliver up to 20 Mw of electricity, enough power to meet 3% of Cornwall's electricity needs. The Wave Hub project will cover an area measuring 2.5 mi by 1 mi; each early developer will be given a 5-to-10-year lease for a space in that area. The British government will subsidize $9 million to the offshore Cornish project. Southwest RDA, which has already spent more than $4 million on permitting, has approved $43.4 million for Wave Hub, with 50% of that sum expected to come from the European Regional Development Fund.

AB  - Water desalination plants produce huge amounts of reject brine, which are usually sent back to the sea, where they could, in the long run, result in detrimental effects on the aquatic life as well as the quality of the seawater in the area. In this study, a new approach for the management of desalination reject brine and capture of CO2, where ammoniated brine is reacted with carbon dioxide, has been investigated. The effects of reaction temperature, reaction time, and excess ammonia were assessed. Carbon dioxide was used either as a pure gas or a mixture of 10% CO2 in methane. The experimental results indicated that the optimum reaction temperature was about 20 Â°C and the optimum NH3/NaCl ratio was 2 for synthetic brine solutions and 3 for actual reject brine. The proposed process proved to be effective in reducing the CO2 concentration in a CO2-CH4 gas mixture by more than 90%. The solubility of sodium bicarbonate was found to play a key role in the removal of sodium. The results indicated that the new approach can reduce the salinity of reject brine and, at the same time, contribute to the reduction CO2 emissions. Â© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) could significantly contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reaching international climate goals. In this process, CO2 is captured and injected into geological formations for permanent storage. The injected plume and its migration within the reservoir is carefully monitored, using geophysical methods. While it is considered unlikely that the injected CO2 should escape the reservoir and reach the marine environment, marine monitoring is required to verify that there are no indications of leakage, and to detect and quantify leakage if it should occur. Marine monitoring is challenging because of the considerable area to be covered, the limited spatial and temporal extent of a potential leakage event, and the considerable natural variability in the marine environment. In this review, we summarize marine monitoring strategies developed to ensure adequate monitoring of the marine environment without introducing prohibitive costs. We also provide an overview of the many different technologies applicable to different aspects of marine monitoring of geologically stored carbon. Finally, we identify remaining knowledge gaps and indicate expected directions for future research.

AB  - If carbon capture and storage is to be adopted as a CO2 mitigation strategy, it is important to understand the associated risks. The risk analysis consists of several elements such as leakage probability, assessing the strength of environmental perturbation, and quantifying the ecological, economic, and social impacts. Here, the environmental perturbation aspect is addressed by using a marine system model of the North West European Shelf seas to simulate the consequences of CO2 additions such as those that could arise from a failure of geological sequestration schemes. Little information exists to guide the choice of leak scenario and many assumptions are required; for consistency the assumptions err towards greater impact and what would be in likelihood extreme scenarios. The simulations indicate that only the largest leakage scenarios tested are capable of producing perturbations that are likely to have environmental consequences beyond the locality of a leak event. It is shown that, given the available evidence, the chemical perturbation of a sequestration leak, regionally integrated, is likely to be insignificant when compared with that from continued non-mitigated atmospheric CO2 emissions and the subsequent acidification of the marine system. The potential ecological impacts of a large environmental CO 2 perturbation are reviewed, indicating that the biogeochemical functioning and biodiversity are sensitive. The key unknowns that must be addressed in future research are identified; namely, the fine scale dispersion of CO2 and the ability of ecological systems to recover from perturbation. Â© 2009 IMechE.

AB  - Ocean is one of the renewable sources of energy that can supply part of the world's energy needs and thus reduce the rate of consumption of fossil fuels and other non-renewable resources. The wave energy can be converted to electricity or other forms of usable energy. Water waves have a relatively high power density with a total global power of approximately 1-10 TW, equivalent to a large fraction of the world's current total energy consumption. This study is aimed at evaluating the existing systems for converting the wave energy into electricity with the idea in mind that they could be used in the Caspian Sea, with average wave energy of 5-14 kW/m. To achieve this, major devices in this field along with the most important design parameters are identified and analyzed. Each existing system's main features are presented in a benchmark table, where each feature is assigned a weighting factor. The total score for each energy extraction system is then obtained. The most suitable device is chosen based on the conditions of the Caspian Sea including amplitude, wavelength and frequency of the waves, the depth of the sea as well as the seabed and shore conditions. The performance and maintenance costs of the device have also contributed to the final selection. Based on the current study, point absorber wave energy converters are the most appropriate devices for harvesting wave energy in Caspian Sea. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Intensive fish culture at high ammonium and low pH
JO  - Aquaculture
PY  - 2006
VL  - 255
IS  - 1-4
AB  - Fish excrete two principal toxic metabolites to the water: NH3 and CO2, the former being typically toxic to fish at low (< 0.1 mg N l(-1)) concentrations. However, allowing the accumulation of metabolic CO2(aq) results in pH reduction, thereby reducing the fraction of NH3 from TAN. Such operation strategy may allow increasing the design criteria for TAN, which can result in reduced water flow requirements in flow-through systems. In this study, growth parameters of sea bream Sparus aurata grown in high TAN and low pH values, were monitored. TAN toxicity was first tested in 27-1 aquariums, where sea bream fingerlings were grown in TAN values of up to 20 mg N l(-1) and pH 6.8, without showing any significant negative effects. Following that, two 100 m(3) marine fish-culture tanks were stocked with 84 g fish and supplied with the same daily feed for 250 days. Liquid oxygen enrichment was affected and paddlewheel aerators were used for CO2 stripping. Seawater was supplied to the high TAN experimental system at an average rate of 5.25 m(3) (kg feed)(-1) and to a control tank at an average rate of 22.9 m(3) (kg feed)(-1) (normal flow-through practice). The experimental system included a solids filter, but not a nitrification unit. TAN concentrations measured in the experimental system were much higher than those in the control system (5.44 +/- 1.2 mg N land 1.34 +/- 0.6 mg N l(-1) on average, respectively), however fish growth and fish mortality rates in both systems were statistically identical. The inorganic carbon mass balance differed significantly between the two systems emphasizing the important role of the CO2 stripping device. The choice of stripping device allows controlling the CO2(aq) concentration, which in turn controls the pH value for a given alkalinity value. Such control over the CO2(aq) concentration enables operating the system at relatively high TAN concentrations while maintaining NH3(aq) below the threshold concentration. An aquatic-chemistry model was developed to predict pH value, and consequently CO2(aq) and NH3(aq) concentrations, assuming steady state conditions. Model results were used to determine the minimal makeup water flow-rate that would allow safe operation with regard to the threshold metabolite concentrations. Model results indicated that under the conditions tested, a flow-through system could be operated safely with a ratio as low as 4.4 m(3) seawater (kg feed)(-1) with no need for a nitrification biofilter. The implications of growing fish at high TAN concentrations are extensive, the most important being a significant reduction in water treatment costs. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Monopiles are used as foundation for offshore wind turbines, and are open-ended steel pipe piles with large diameters. For the offshore wind energy converters of 5 MW and higher, the pile diameter may be greater than 5 m. The p-y curve method has been used extensively for the design of pile foundation design and the p-y curves for piles in cohesionless soil are determined based on field test results with a pile diameter of less than 2 m, and less than 200 cycles under cyclic loading conditions. Therefore, some modifications of p-y curves need to be considered for the monopile foundation designing of offshore wind turbine. The suitability of p-y curves for designing monopile foundation is reviewed in this study. The reduction of the subgrade reaction modulus due to pile diameter, the effect of high-cycle of cyclic lateral load and scour around the monopile are considered in the modifications of p-y curves. The deformations calculated with unmodified p-y curves seem to be under estimated.

AB  - Imprudent fossil fuel use for getting energy caused serious environmental problems making us necessary to seeking for alternative energy sources which are renewable and sustainable. Using wind energy is currently considered as one of feasible renewable energy sources, however, the problem of noise pollution from the sweep of turbine blades should be solved. As a feasible solution for the noise pollution problem, the construction of wind farms offshore is currently considered. In addition, many factors can change the onshore wind speed, while offshore wind has a higher wind speed and consistency, which leads to higher energy efficiency. However, the remained intermittency of wind energy makes storage media such as H2 necessary, thus, the construction of an offshore wind base H2 production system can be required for protecting the energy security. In this study, a comparative economic analysis is conducted to verify feasible equipment placements of offshore wind-based H2 production systems in various possible cases with different electrolyzer types, wind speeds, and offshore distances. An optimization study for 4 case scenarios with different regions, offshore lengths, and kinds of electrolyzers, was preliminarily conducted to find several placements that are economically optimal in common. For the optimization, a mixed-integer programming tool in Python was used, and as a result, three absolutely economical placements were selected. Then, the comparative economic analysis with considering the selected three cases was conducted indicating the most feasible placement according to the considered offshore length and wind speed, and costs ranged from 1.64 to 4.46 $ kgH2âˆ’1. From the optimal cases for considered regions (Ulsan, Magallanes), the system using alkaline electrolyzer can achieve the feasible prices for both regions, while using other types stay in ranges of the current green H2 produced by electrolysis.

TI  - Ship Speed Optimization Considering Ocean Currents to Enhance Environmental Sustainability in Maritime Shipping
JO  - Sustainability
PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 9
AB  - Enhancing environmental sustainability in maritime shipping has emerged as an important topic for both firms in shipping-related industries and policy makers. Speed optimization has been proven to be one of the most effective operational measures to achieve this goal, as fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of a ship are very sensitive to its sailing speed. Existing research on ship speed optimization does not differentiate speed through water (STW) from speed over ground (SOG) when formulating the fuel consumption function and the sailing time function. Aiming to fill this research gap, we propose a speed optimization model for a fixed ship route to minimize the total fuel consumption over the whole voyage, in which the influence of ocean currents is taken into account. As the difference between STW and SOG is mainly due to ocean currents, the proposed model is capable of distinguishing STW from SOG. Thus, in the proposed model, the ship's fuel consumption and sailing time can be determined with the correct speed. A case study on a real voyage for an oil products tanker shows that: (a) the average relative error between the estimated SOG and the measured SOG can be reduced from 4.75\% to 1.36\% across sailing segments, if the influence of ocean currents is taken into account, and (b) the proposed model can enable the selected oil products tanker to save 2.20\% of bunker fuel and reduce 26.12 MT of CO2 emissions for a 280-h voyage. The proposed model can be used as a practical and robust decision support tool for voyage planners/managers to reduce the fuel consumption and GHG emissions of a ship.

The research found that the flow field characteristic of counter-rotating HATT is more ordered than traditional HATT. Dynamic performance, power performance and starting requirement of counter-rotating HATT is superior to that of traditional HATT. The optimal range of blade installation angle of counter-rotating HATT is from 57 degree to 65 degree. At an optimal L of near 0.225D (where L is the distance between the front and rear rotators and D is diameter of rotor), counter-rotating HATT showed best power performance among the 3 tested L.

AB  - It is significant to study the aerodynamic characteristics for operational capability of Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT), as HAWT have been widely used in offshore wind energy exploitation in recent years. A 3-D numerical method was developed for the aerodynamic performance of HAWT, which combined panel method with lift line method. Flow phenomena of different blade angles of attack were researched by different tip-speed ratio parts. A 3-D panel method based on the velocity potential was introduced when tip-speed ratio is high, and blade span flow and blade interaction were all considered. Numerical calculation based on lift line method was established for the case of low tip-speed ration, which pays more attention to aspect ratio and viscosity in the high blade angle of attack. Numerical results of NREL PHASE VI wind turbine by use of the present method show good agreement with experimental results, especially for the prediction of the maximum output power of wind turbine. The method can be applied to optimize turbine configurations and characterize aerodynamic loads which act on the offshore wind turbine foundation.

TI  - Coastal carbon processing rates increase with mangrove cover following a hurricane in Texas, USA
JO  - Ecosphere
PY  - 2022
VL  - 13
IS  - 3
AB  - Changes in species distributions and disturbances have complex impacts on ecosystem functioning. In many subtropical coastal wetlands, plant identity and cover are changing, as salt marshes dominated by low-stature herbaceous species transition to woody mangroves. These systems are also subject to frequent and potentially more intense hurricanes, which can alter a range of ecosystem structures and functions. We examined how changes in dominant plant species affected carbon processing in coastal wetlands following a hurricane. We experimentally manipulated cell-scale (3 x 3 m) cover of black mangroves (Avicennia germinans) and salt marsh plants (e.g., Spartina alterniflora and Batis maritima) in fringe and interior locations of 10 plots (24 x 42 m) to create a gradient in mangrove cover in coastal Texas, USA. Hurricane Harvey made direct landfall over our site on 25 August 2017, uniformly decreasing soil nutrients and impacting the spatial patterns of total soil sulfide accumulation (delta S-34). To test how mangrove cover affected carbon processing and retention after the hurricane, we measured litter breakdown rates (k) of A. germinans and S. alterniflora in surface soils and associated microbial respiration rates, and fast- and slow-decomposing standard litter substrates (green and red tea, respectively) in subsurface soils (15 cm depth). Soil temperatures were lower in mangrove than marsh cells, and A. germinans litter k increased linearly with plot-level mangrove cover. Breakdown rates of S. alterniflora and fast-decomposing green tea litter increased nonlinearly with mangrove cover (highest k at intermediate \% cover). Slow-decomposing red tea had similar k in all plots and was highest where soil delta S-34 was greatest. Microbial respiration rates (R) did not change with plot-level mangrove cover for either S. alterniflora or A. germinans litter. Respiration associated with S. alterniflora litter was highest in interior marsh cells, and R associated with A. germinans litter was similar between fringe and interior mangrove cells. Despite widespread declines in soil nutrient concentrations and increases in delta S-34, all predicted to decrease R and k, post-hurricane carbon processing increased with mangrove cover in coastal wetlands. Our results indicate that disturbances can reduce local plant identity effects and may enhance carbon loss.

VL  - 2014-August
IS  - NA
AB  - The research area of asset management and cost reduction for wind energy is increasing in importance as over 100,000 turbine assets are currently installed worldwide. Such large numbers of turbine assets, with a growing offshore component, drive demand for research into improved decision support for wind farm planners and operators - as the operational risk for the assets is removed from OEMs (while under warranty) and is transferred to the power utility owners (post-warranty). The current and future demand for research in this field has thus been driven by the needs of owner/operators and central government policy formulation. The huge potential energy available from offshore wind in particular, is well known. The most crucial aspect of future deployment levels is the economic recovery of this potential energy. The long-term viability of the offshore wind power as a large scale energy solution hinges on reduction of the cost of energy, as a purely cost-based energy market would currently produce a gas- and coal-based system. Operational expenditure (OPEX) accounts for roughly 1/3 of the total cost of energy from an offshore wind farm. Crucially, the number of practical decisions and options available to an operator to reduce OPEX are limited and need to be clearly stated and understood before opportunities for cost reduction can be taken. The areas of research identified by the authors to aid in this process can be summarised into 3 key themes: 1) Asset and meteo-ocean modelling to support offshore operations and maintenance, 2) Analysis of wind farm maintenance data for asset life cycle optimization, and 3) Role of condition monitoring in decreasing OPEX.

AB  - This paper presents measurement and simulation results in offshore wind farms following blocking of the HVDC converter used for connecting the wind farm to the main onshore grid. It is shown that the voltage will rise by approximately 30% within 50-100 ms in the ensuing island operation. The process is superimposed by transients caused by short but repetitive periods of saturation of the transformer resulting in excitation of the resonance frequency between transformer and cable capacitance predominantly in the zero sequence. It is demonstrated that in EMT type simulation the phenomena can be reproduced provided that the wind turbine control and the saturation of the transformer are properly modelled. A simulation tool has been used to demonstrate the effect of the level of wind farm loading at the instant of islanding on the observed phenomena. Â© 2016 IEEE.

TI  - Met-ocean conditions influence on floating offshore wind farms power production
JO  - Wind Energy
PY  - 2016
VL  - 19
IS  - 3
AB  - Met-ocean conditions may affect the performance of a floating wind turbine, since a harsh climate could lead the system to exceed its operating thresholds and thus to force the machine shutdown. In this paper, it is a proposed methodology to evaluate the effect of met-ocean conditions on the long-term dynamic behaviour, and energy production, of a floating wind farm. For a sample of 500 MW farm located off the coast of Aberdeen (Scotland), 20 years of met-ocean data are generated by means of meteorological reanalysis techniques. A subset of 1000 hourly conditions is selected, by means of a maximum dissimilarity algorithm, and input to a dynamic floating wind turbine model. Numerical results are then interpolated for the whole set of met-ocean data, using radial basis functions. This approach allows to dramatically reduce the global computation time. Tower inclination and hub acceleration are chosen as relevant operating parameters: the former mainly depends on mean wind speed and direction, being largest at rated wind speed. The latter is also affected by significant wave height, and reaches its highest values when wind and waves are aligned. For each simulation, any machine exceeding the selected safety threshold is considered to be shut down. Assuming continuous operation, the average lifespan capacity factor of the farm is 50.2%; more restrictive tolerances result in a non-linear reduction of the energy production. This approach may help both at the design and the operational stage, in determining the best trade-off between energy production and safe operation. Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Numerical study on overtopping performance of a multi-level breakwater for wave energy conversion
JO  - Ocean Engineering
PY  - 2018
VL  - 150
IS  - NA
AB  - Overtopping wave energy converter (OWEC) is capable of converting the unstable wave energy into the relatively stable potential energy in its reservoir. The small wave height and the large tidal range in China will cause a lower efficiency of the traditional single-level overtopping device especially at the lower tidal level. The design of the multi-level reservoirs may be a solution to improve the overtopping performance, which can be integrated in the sloping-ramp breakwater. In this study, a multi-level breakwater for wave energy conversion, consisting of two reservoirs with sloping walls at different levels, is proposed. A numerical wave tank based on the VOF model is established in ANSYS-Fluent (R) 12.0 for the OVVEC's performance investigation. The numerical model on predicting the overtopping process and time-averaged discharges is validated by corresponding experimental data. Effects of the opening width of the lower reservoir, sloping angles of two reservoirs and the gap height between the reservoirs on the dimensionless overtopping discharges are studied numerically. It is found that a smaller opening width, larger height ratio, and two sloping angles of 30 degrees have positive effects to improve the overtopping performance of the device.

JO  - Journal Of Marine Science And Engineering
PY  - 2022
VL  - 10
IS  - 3
AB  - The decarbonisation of waterborne transport is arguably the biggest challenge faced by the maritime industry presently. By 2050, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the shipping industry by 50% compared to 2008, with a vision to phase out fossil fuels by the end of the century as a matter of urgency. To meet such targets, action must be taken immediately to address the barriers to adopt the various clean shipping options currently at different technological maturity levels. Green hydrogen as an alternative fuel presents an attractive solution to meet future targets from international bodies and is seen as a viable contributor within a future clean shipping vision. The cost of hydrogen fuelâ€”in the shortâ€term at leastâ€”is higher compared to conventional fuel; therefore, energyâ€saving devices (ESDs) for ships are more important than ever, as implementation of rules and regulations restrict the use of fossil fuels while promoting zeroâ€emission technology. However, existing and emerging ESDs in standalone/combination for traditional fossil fuel driven vessels have not been researched to assess their compatibility for hydrogenâ€powered ships, which present new challenges and considerations within their design and operation. Therefore, this review aims to bridge that gap by firstly identifying the new challenges that a hydrogenâ€powered propulsion system brings forth and then reviewing the quantitative energy saving capability and qualitive additional benefits of individual existing and emerging ESDs in standalone and combination, with recommendations for the most applicable ESD combinations with hydrogenâ€powered waterborne transport presented to maximise energy saving and minimise the negative impact on the propulsion system components. In summary, the most compatible combination ESDs for hydrogen will depend largely on factors such as vessel types, routes, propulsion, operation, etc. However, the mitigation of load fluctuations commonly encountered during a vessels operation was viewed to be a primary area of interest as it can have a negative impact on hydrogen propulsion system components such as the fuel cell; therefore, the ESD combination that can maximise energy savings as well as minimise the fluctuating loads experienced would be viewed as the most compatible with hydrogenâ€powered waterborne transport.

AB  - The maritime industry has entered its pathway of decarbonization. To achieve the IMO's ambitious goals of an absolute emissions reduction of 50\% by 2050, and a 70\% carbon intensity reduction by 2050 compared to the 2008 level, various options for the adoption of technologies and alternative fuels are considered by the market stakeholders.Ammonia, one of the most promising alternative marine fuels has long been considered to reduce carbon emissions. And solid oxide fuel cell is expected to transform ship propulsion technology in the future due to its high utilization of fuels. In this paper, a feasibility study is performed to assess the application of an ammonia cracker-integrated solid oxide fuel cell (hereafter as Ammonia SOFC) system on an ocean-going vessel through a detailed CAPEX, FuelEX, OPEX, Carbon tax, and carbon emission analysis. Comparison is made with direct ammonia, LNG and conventional fuels fired heat engines. The result concludes that it can be economically viable to apply to deep-sea shipping, compared to other marine fuels and propulsion technologies.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In this paper, we present a prototype using polarized-light scattering method to detect the suspended particles. The optical schematic diagram is shown at first to describe how the polarized light is launched and the scattered polarizations are measured. The concept profile and physical image of the prototype and its battery are shown. The prototype was deployed in the Daya Bay (at the edge of South China Sea) in December, 2017. The data showed that the polarization parameters of particles in two deployment sites were quite different. And moreover, the polarization parameters normalized by the intensity, can characterize the difference between the particles in two sites. The prototype can detect the concentration of the particles in water. Advices for the next generation are given in the end.

AB  - The Green Growth Framework for Fiji under its theme for sustainable maritime transportation, envisages deployment of renewable energy technologies, retrofitting of existing vessels and development of improved vessel designs as some of the measures needed to make shipping more energy efficient. In this study, the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP) tool is used to develop various maritime transport scenarios (2016â€“2040) based on possible interventions. Domestic maritime transport used approximately 79 million litres of fuel in 2016 out of which 77% was marine diesel oil while the remaining was premix. The total emissions from maritime transport in 2016 was estimated to be 214 Gg of CO 2 e. At 2% annual growth rate in maritime passenger and freight activity, the total annual fuel consumption will increase to 127 million litres by 2040 with corresponding GHG emissions of 342 Gg of CO 2 e under the BAU scenario. This paper quantifies possible reductions in fossil fuel usage and associated emissions through energy efficiency and alternative fuels in the domestic sea transport sector in Fiji.

AB  - Negative emission technologies (NETs) could play a key role in ensuring net-zero and longer-term net negative emission ambitions are met. However, greenhouse gas emissions (and other pollutants) will occur over the life cycle of a NET and will need to be taken into consideration when developing schemes to roll out their use. We compare five NETs: afforestation/reforestation (AR), enhanced weathering (EW), mangrove restoration (MR), bioenergy and direct air capture with carbon storage (BECCS and DAC), using life cycle assessment to determine their environmental impacts (global warming, freshwater, toxicity etc.). We find that there is a wide range in the environmental impacts estimated across the NETs and the context in which they are used will directly impact which NET has low or high environmental impacts. This is an important aspect to consider when deciding which NET to prioritise in strategies to roll out their use on large scales. If consistent removal of CO2 from the atmosphere is the goal, then AR and MR have the lowest environmental impacts. However, if large and quick CO2 removal is the goal then EW, DAC and BECCS have similar, if not lower, environmental impacts. Â© 2022 The Authors

JO  - Nature Climate Change
PY  - 2012
VL  - 2
IS  - 12
AB  - Sea-level rise (SLR) is a critical and uncertain climate change risk, involving timescales of centuries. Here we use a semi-empirical model, calibrated with sea-level data of the past millennium, to estimate the SLR implications of holding warming below 2 Â°C or 1.5 Â°C above pre-industrial temperature, as mentioned in the CancÃºn Agreements. Limiting warming to these levels with a probability larger than 50% produces 75-80 cm SLR above the year 2000 by 2100. This is 25 cm below a scenario with unmitigated emissions, but 15 cm above a hypothetical scenario reducing global emissions to zero by 2016. The long-term SLR implications of the two warming goals diverge substantially on a multi-century timescale owing to inertia in the climate system and the differences in rates of SLR by 2100 between the scenarios. By 2300 a 1.5 Â°C scenario could peak sea level at a median estimate of 1.5 m above 2000. The 50% probability scenario for 2 Â°C warming would see sea level reaching 2.7 m above 2000 and still rising at about double the present-day rate. Halting SLR within a few centuries is likely to be achieved only with the large-scale deployment of CO2 removal efforts, for example, combining large-scale bioenergy systems with carbon capture and storage.

AB  - The calcium-looping process for post-combustion carbon dioxide capture, an economically and technically feasible method suitable for large-scale use, has recently gained much attention. However, the capture capacity of calcium-based sorbents rapidly decreases after only a few cycles. Herein, calcium-based sorbents with enhanced cyclic CO2-capture capacity have been derived from cheap, natural raw materials by using a simple impregnation method. Limestone and shells were used as the calcium-based raw materials, with sea salt as dopant. Modified limestone had the highest CO2-capture capacity after multiple carbonation-calcination cycles. Sea-salt-doped sorbent showed a relatively stable porous surface during cycles, which resulted in a higher CO2-capture capacity.

VL  - 233
IS  - NA
AB  - In this paper, the possibility of injecting CO2 into a hydrate reservoir, with the only aim of preventing methane release was investigated. Pure methane hydrates were formed and then partially dissociated, due to a provoked temperature increase of 2 degrees C. The same procedure was applied to a system composed by a core of CO2 hydrates and an external shell made with CO2 hydrates. In tests with only methane hydrate, that temperature increase caused partial hydrate dissociation, with a consequent increase in pressure about 7.81-8.42 bar. In presence of CO2 hydrate, the same temperature increase did not cause any dissociation, even if the new established condition were not suitable for CH4 hydrates stability. Results proved that CO2 is capable to form a strong hydrate shell around the methane core, which hinders its dissociation. Two positive contributions were reached: CO2 permanent storage and the prevention of CH4 release in the atmosphere. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this article is to highlight the impact of a periodic power source, such as a tidal turbine, on the operation and sizing of an autonomous hybrid microgrid with photovoltaic panels and storage. The technique of hill climbing (repeated local search) is used to find the optimum combination of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and storage units with respect to the required capital cost for various load curves and weather conditions. To model the operation of the microgrid devices, analytical and phenomenological models, have been used, which take into account the specifications of actual commercial devices. Six different case studies are presented, with and without a tidal generator, which are based on six different sets of electrical consumption data corresponding to the Euripus campus of the National & Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA) in Psachna, Evia, Greece, and respective meteorological and tidal current data from the region. The results show that tidal energy may be used in a RES microgrid, where applicable, to satisfy the base load requirements, leading to a reduction in installed capacities of intermittent RES and storage, accompanied with cost reduction, especially in cases where a high load factor is observed or may be achieved, through demand response mechanisms. Such a hybrid microgrid configuration may be appropriate for regions where low velocity tidal and marine currents exist along with substantial solar and/or wind energy potential, such as the Mediterranean coast line and islands.

JO  - Soil Science Society Of America Journal
PY  - 2020
VL  - 84

AB  - Biological invasion has profoundly influenced coastal soil reservoirs of carbon. Previous carbon studies regarding biological invasion in coastal wetlands mainly focused on soil organic carbon; however, little is known about the mechanisms that control soil inorganic carbon (SIC, e.g., carbonates) variation. In order to explore our understanding, we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate controlling mechanisms of SIC in response to Spartina alterniflora (Loisel) invasion in the east-central China coast, where there is a lack of native salt marsh species. A space-for-time substitution method was used to identify sampling sites, assuming it has the capability to quantify the soil-vegetation relationship along a gradient of the increasing S. alterniflora age (17 year). The results showed that soil inorganic carbon density (SICD) at the 0.3-0.6 m depth exhibited a decline under S. alterniflora invasion, while there was no substantial change at the depths of 0-0.3 m and 0.6-1 m. The majority of the variances in SICD changes could be explained by S. alterniflora invasion and key soil physicochemical variables. In SEM, S. alterniflora invasion, soil water content, and soil texture presented direct influence on SICD throughout the soil profile (i.e., to 1 m depth). Soil salinity presented direct influence on SICD in the upper 0.6 m soil, while pH played an important role in the depth of 0.6-1 m. These results highlight that dynamics of SIC processes are probably controlled by interactions among S. alterniflora invasion and key soil physicochemical variables.

JO  - Sae Technical Papers

IS  - 2021
AB  - The port-logistic industry has a significant impact on the urban environment nearby ports and on the surrounding coastal areas. This is due to the use of large auxiliary power systems on ships operating during port stays, as well as to the employment of a number of fossil fuel powered road vehicles required for port operations. The environmental impact related to the use of these vehicles is twofold: on one hand, they contribute directly to port emissions by fuel consumption; on the other hand, they require some of the ship auxiliary systems to operate intensively, such as the ventilation system, which must operate to remove the pollutants produced by the vehicle engines inside the ship. The pathway to achieve decarbonization and mitigation of energy use in ports involves therefore the adoption of alternative and cleaner technology solutions for the propulsion systems of such port vehicles. This paper presents the performance analysis of a hydrogen powered cargo-handling vehicle for roll-on and roll-off port operations in a real case scenario. The fuel cell/battery hybrid powertrain of the vehicle has been previously designed by the authors. On the base of real data acquired during an on-field measurement campaign, and by means of a validated numerical model of the vehicle dynamics, different mission profiles are defined, in terms of driving and duty cycles, in order to represent typical port operations. A rule-based energy management strategy is then used to estimate the energy and hydrogen consumptions required by the vehicle and to assess its suitability to accomplish the defined target port operations. Outputs from this study show the potential of the proposed solution to take the place, in a foreseeable future, of conventional Diesel-engine vehicles, today commonly used in port logistics, towards a zero-emission scenario.

AB  - In 2007, the population of the United States reached 300 million; that of the globe recently hit 6 billion. Climate change and ecological damage unparalleled in recent history echoed these milestones. Storms have become more erratic and extreme. The first plot of habitable land recently gave way to rising sea levels in coastal India. Deforestation, desertification, and sprawling development are drastically reducing the world's biological diversity and available arable land. Global warming is no longer under dispute. The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change links human behavior with higher land and ocean temperatures and rising sea levels over the past century and into the future (IPCC 2007). The greatest impetus for growing greener is thus the impending crises stemming from climate change. Human activities are responsible for many of these ecological problems. For example, in America's Appalachian region and other mining districts around the world, miners eliminated mountains, filled river valleys, and left gaping holes carved into the earth's crust to reach the underlying natural resources. The use of fossil fuels for transport and manufacturing concentrates pollution in the air, oceans, animals, and, most worrisome, in those who use them and their children. Just as humans have created these problems, they can also relieve them by promoting greener patterns of growth. Most important, they can reduce the demand for energy through promoting green regional design to achieve a greater balance between the built and natural environments, curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Intervention at the regional scale is not only feasible but also necessary to counteract the dangers of climate change. In this essay we define the key aspects of green regional design. We then use the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut metropolitan area as a case study of the application of regional design, detailing its use in the creation of open space, transportation (and related land uses) and energy networks that frame an area's growth and development. We show how it makes the area more livable and competitive while addressing global warming. Copyright Â© 2008 University of Pennsylvania Press.

AB  - The large head mass of an offshore wind turbine can be reduced by using superconducting technology. As a proof of concept, a superconducting 10 MW wind turbine for offshore application is investigated under the SUPRAPOWER project funded by EU-FP7. SC coils were developed using MgB2 tapes and cooled to 20 K by a two stage Gifford McMahon cryocooler in a modular rotating cryostat. To study the coil performance and to measure and control the sub model, a LABVIEW based instrumentation system is developed. To measure the temperature distribution in a rotating cryostat, an optical based sensing system is designed and introduced. The effect of rotation on an optical based sensing system is studied. In this paper, the instrumentation along with the thermal characteristics and validation of the optical sensing system for rotating machines and its installation techniques will be reported.

JO  - Journal Of Cleaner Production
PY  - 2019
VL  - 222
IS  - NA
AB  - The implementation of International Maritime Organization regulations for CO 2 emission reduction has oriented ships to sail at lower speeds. Speed reduction reduces fuel consumption of ships significantly. In order to perform efficient ship operation, energy demand throughout the whole engine room has to be decreased. The goal of the study is to minimize electrical power consumption during slow steaming operation, hence equivalent fuel consumption and emissions could be decreased. A computational study was carried out in order to clarify potential savings with respect to main engine load. The study quantifies the energy savings in main engine cooling system which has significant potential to reduce electrical power consumption in slow steaming operations. Operational requirements are determined with the help of realistic engine room simulator of a container ship which has waste heat recovery system. The values, obtained from the simulator were verified using the technical manual of a diesel engine, which have similar output power range. The results of calculations show that there is great potential to improve energy efficiency when variable pumps are used. Based on the results, from the main engine cooling system, 60% of electrical power demand reduction can be achieved. The power reduction saved by pumps, decreases considerable amount of marine diesel oil consumption as 296.2 tons where 367.4 tons of fuel needed by diesel generators or oil fired boiler. The reduction in fuel consumption is 80% that the saving in the central cooling system corresponds 948 tons of CO 2 emission reduction and $207,300 cost saving. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd

JO  - Applied Energy
PY  - 2022
VL  - 328
IS  - NA
AB  - This study was planned to offer the roadmap for lifecycle clean shipping by addressing the fundamental question of â€˜what are the promising energy solutions for the shipping sector?â€™. This goal was attempted to be achieved by a lifecycle comparative analysis of the viability of three zero-carbon fuels, ammonia, hydrogen, and inland electricity, based on the operational practicality as well as Well-to-Wake environmental impacts. Credible business scenarios were designed with a high-level screening of 27 short-route ferries currently engaged in 26 West-Scotland coastal routes. Then a series of comparative analyses between the diesel and the proposed alternative fuel sources was conducted. While carbon-free fuels are in the early stages of development in the UK, there are various views on how these fuels can be produced, distributed, and used onboard for the clean shipping economy. To determine the optimal energy solutions, all credible scenarios for the upstream pathways for these fuels were developed, based on the current and future prospected UK energy infrastructure and grids. Those scenarios were examined for West-Scotland shipping and extended to the UK targets. Their technical aspects for maritime application were also investigated in consideration of safety, regulation, infrastructural availability, supply chain constraints, barriers, and the downstream emission pathways to their uptake onboard. Ship conceptual designs were briefly conducted to evaluate the systems, technologies, and equipment required for onboard installation to utilise zero-carbon fuels. As a result of the study, when hydrogen was used as a fuel in fuel cells and electricity was supplied as a backup from batteries that store inland power and the solar PV system, GHG emissions were 25.7% of the conventional fossil fuel-using scenario. In addition, it was confirmed that GWP was 22.2% compared to MGO when ammonia was used as fuel without reforming into hydrogen and backup power was supplied from batteries and the solar PV system. It is believed that the analysis results can distinctively demonstrate the adequacy or the inadequacy of current maritime policies for decarbonising shipping. This research finally provides potential solutions for future UK maritime environmental protection and for enhancing the competitiveness of ship owners. In addition, this research concept can serve as a sample that suggests the direction of ideal research for future energy solutions in the marine sector. Â© 2022

AB  - Exploitative innovation emphasizes the refinement of technologies. For example, the super long and super flexible blade is an improvement on the traditional blade. Exploratory innovation emphasizes the breakthrough of technological trajectories. The floating offshore wind turbine represents a revolutionary innovation. For survival and prosperity, wind power enterprises need to excel simultaneously at both exploitative and exploratory innovations. The Chinese government has issued a series of wind power innovation policies, but their impact on exploitative and exploratory innovations is not clear. Moreover, technological path dependence describes the connection between intertemporal innovations. The prevalence of QWERTY keyboard is the best case. While the effect of technological path dependence on the impact of innovation policies is also unknown. Using micro-data from listed Chinese wind power enterprises from 2006 to 2019, this study clarifies the effects of innovation policies on exploitative and exploratory innovations, and assesses the moderating effect of technological path dependence. Our results indicate that the effects of wind power innovation policies are significant, yet ambiguous. All categories of policies improve exploitative innovation, but negatively impact exploratory innovation. Besides, technological path dependence positively moderates the positive relationship between policy and exploitative innovation and the negative relationship between policy and exploratory innovation.

AB  - Anthropogenic activity such as offshore wind energy farm development, shipping activity, resource extraction platforms or marine aquaculture can have adverse impacts on the visual quality of coastal landscapes. GIS-based viewshed analysis is the most widely used technique to address visual impacts. However, despite the wide application its spatial extent remains limited to local and regional studies. This study presents a GIS-based model for cumulative visual impact assessment on macro-regional scale based on a case study for the Baltic Sea. The viewshed model was deployed over a visibility zone covering 54% (223.641 km2) of the Baltic Sea space using a database of 63,672 observation points integrated by geospatial data on existing and planned sea uses representing potential visual stressors. Results show that areas of highest potential visual impact are sheltered coastal areas with complex geomorphological features such as barrier islands, peninsulas, straits, archipelagos and lagoons in combination with intensive anthropogenic activity and presence of nature protected areas. The methodology can be applied to any coastal area of the world to classify coastal areas due to their cumulative viewshed characteristics and as early monitoring tool for visual impact assessment on transboundary scale.

AB  - To meet the International maritime Organization's greenhouse gas (GHG) emission targets of 2030 and 2040, the maritime industry must take a two-pronged approach, which is to grow LNG ship fleet and bunkering capacity while the complex work to develop zero-emission fuel continues. This two-track approach is important to maximizing and accelerating shipping's reduction in GHG emissions. LNG's environmental footprint is significantly better than alternative fuels, e.g., distillates and heavy fuel oils, having almost no sulfur or particulate emission and significantly less nitrous oxide emission, leading to considerably less local pollution around ports and port cities. Specifically, life-cycle assessment of GHG emissions has found LNG to be up to 33% less than traditional heavy fuel oils, a performance which includes any methane slip along the life cycle value chain. Combining LNG as a marine fuel with energy deficient design and operations can make a vessel compliant with IMO 2050 targets.

TI  - Sources of sediment carbon sequestered in restored seagrass meadows
JO  - Marine Ecology Progress Series
PY  - 2016
VL  - 551
IS  - NA
AB  - Seagrass meadows accumulate carbon in sediments as a result of in situ production and sedimentation of particulate organic matter (OM). We quantified the contribution of OM sources to the sediment carbon pool in restored seagrass meadows of different ages (unvegetated and 4 and 10 yr since restoration) in the Virginia coastal bays. Using carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stable isotopes, we estimated the contribution of seagrass (Zostera marina), benthic diatoms and sestonic particles (BD/S), and macroalgae (MA) to the sediment OM pool influenced by restoration (top 10 cm) with a Bayesian mixing model. Marsh grass was not a likely source based on C: N ratios of the sediment OM. The 4 and 10 yr seagrass meadows had similar OM source contributions to the top 10 cm of sediment, which were distinct from those of unvegetated sites. Seagrass, BD/S, and MA contributed 41, 56, and 3\%, respectively, in the 10 yr age treatments and 50, 46, and 4\%, respectively, in the 4 yr age treatments. Diagenesis of OM sources had little impact on the source contribution estimates. In combination with carbon accumulation rates at these sites (37 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), these results indicate that 10 yr after seeding, restored seagrass meadows accumulated seagrass carbon at a rate of 14.3 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and non-seagrass carbon (BD/S and MA) at a rate of 22.4 g C m(-2) yr(-1). This study demonstrates how seagrass restoration contributes to the sequestration of `blue carbon' and quantifies the impact restored seagrass meadow age has on stored sediment carbon.

TI  - A Competitive Advantage of Middle-Sized Diatoms From Increasing Seawater CO2
JO  - Frontiers In Microbiology
PY  - 2022
VL  - 13
IS  - NA
AB  - Diatoms, one of the most important phytoplankton groups, fulfill their carbon demand from seawater mainly by obtaining passively diffused carbon dioxide (CO2) and/or actively consuming intracellular energy to acquire bicarbonate (HCO3 â€“). An anthropogenically induced increase in seawater CO2 reduces the HCO3 â€“ requirement of diatoms, potentially saving intracellular energy and benefitting their growth. This effect is commonly speculated to be most remarkable in larger diatoms that are subject to a stronger limitation of CO2 supply because of their smaller surface-to-volume ratios. However, we constructed a theoretical model for diatoms and revealed a unimodal relationship between the simulated growth rate response (GRR, the ratio of growth rates under elevated and ambient CO2) and cell size, with the GRR peaking at a cell diameter of âˆ¼7 Î¼m. The simulated GRR of the smallest diatoms was low because the CO2 supply was nearly sufficient at the ambient level, while the decline of GRR from a cell diameter of 7 Î¼m was simulated because the contribution of seawater CO2 to the total carbon demand greatly decreased and diatoms became less sensitive to CO2 increase. A collection of historical data in CO2 enrichment experiments of diatoms also showed a roughly unimodal relationship between maximal GRR and cell size. Our model further revealed that the â€œoptimalâ€ cell size corresponding to peak GRR enlarged with the magnitude of CO2 increase but diminished with elevating cellular carbon demand, leading to projection of the smallest optimal cell size in the equatorial Pacific upwelling zone. Last, we need to emphasize that the size-dependent effects of increasing CO2 on diatoms are multifaceted, while our model only considers the inorganic carbon supply from seawater and optimal allocation of intracellular energy. Our study proposes a competitive advantage of middle-sized diatoms and can be useful in projecting changes in the diatom community in the future acidified high-CO2 ocean.

AB  - Due to high fuel prices on the world market and regulations for emission reduction, nowdays many shipping companies are forced to experiment with different types of ship propulsion in order to minimize fuel consumption and meet the criteria for CO2 release into the atmosphere, and thereby to reduce the transportation costs. This article will give an insight into the range of alternative energy sources and various possible alternative solutions for ship propulsion. Some of these projects will enter commercial operation in late 2014. A new generation of ships is a technical concept that is highly advanced and very practical for the environment in the near future. This article will also present the amount of fuel savings and CO2 emission reduction compared to conventional ships, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of different solutions for ship propulsion. In the next few years, we can expect a further major investment in the development of vessels with greater fuel efficiency and reduced CO2 emission by 30\%. That is very useful information that must be taken into account, as the fuel prices on the world market are growing, and requirements for the allowable amount of exhausted CO2 in the atmosphere are becoming more stringent.

JO  - Applied Soil Ecology
PY  - 2022
VL  - 170
IS  - NA
AB  - Coastal marshes play a notable role in sequestering carbon in plants and soil; however, coastal ecosystems are vulnerable to global change in terms of sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion. The effects of independent and interactive hydrological treatments of waterlogging and elevated salinity on soil CO2 effluxes in Spartina alterniflora marshes were investigated based on a mesocosm approach. This study highlighted the importance of respective soil respirations during inundation (nondrainage, Rs.ND) and reaeration (drainage, Rs.D) in the marshes soils. We found that waterlogging treatments heavily suppressed Rs.ND but increased the Rs.D, regardless of salinity levels. Light salinity enhanced soil respiration, whereas high salinity inhibited soil CO2 efflux, regardless of the water table level. Waterlogging strengthened the negative effects of salinity on Rs.ND and offset the negative effects on Rs.D. The variations in soil respiration under the hydrological treatments can be mainly attributed to changes in root biomass; indigenous soil microbial biomass; and activities of sucrase, cellulase and dehydrogenase, as well as ionic concentrations and oxidation-reduction potential. The temperature sensitivity (Q10 value) of soil respiration (only for Rs.D) after drainage showed a notable decline under the conditions of waterlogging and high salinity. The effect degree of coupled hydrological treatments on soil respiration and Q10 values was similar to a single waterlogging factor before drainage and more strongly than a single factor after drainage. We suggest that the soil CO2 efflux under water flooding and reaeration, inundation duration, and salinity levels need to be considered to understand the impacts of future hydrological changes on coastal marshes.

AB  - Maritime shipping is one of the most important activities of the global economy, with outstanding advantages in terms of volume and distance. According to projections by the International Transport Forum, Global demand for marine transportation is expected to grow dramatically over the next three decades. Along with that, maritime activities emit large amounts of greenhouse gases and other harmful emissions, causing negative impacts on the environment. Energy consumption trends (ECT) are formed by the application of potential emission reduction solutions such as technical improvement, use of alternative fuels, efficient and economical use of fuel and optimal vessel operation. However, ECT is, an issue related to various criteria to be assessed. The goal of this study is to make science assessment of ECT which can be developed national ship emission reduction strategy. Availability of energy supply and use, emission reduction potential, economic efficiency were simultaneously considered to evaluating ECT to cut GHG emission from shipping by using Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process combined with opinions of 46 experts. The results show that hydrogen fuel ranks highest in ECT as the future fuel of the maritime industry. The findings of this study are expected as an important platform to develop national ship emission reduction strategy planning. Â© 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

JO  - Philosophical Transactions Of The Royal Society A-mathematical Physical And Engineering Sciences
PY  - 2020
VL  - 378
IS  - 2178, SI
AB  - A system of two coupled four-beam acoustic Doppler current profilers was used to collect turbulence measurements over a 36-h period at a highly energetic tidal energy site in Alderney Race. This system enables the evaluation of the six components of the Reynolds stress tensor throughout a large proportion of the water column. The present study provides mean vertical profiles of the velocity, the turbulence intensity and the integral lengthscale along the streamwise, spanwise and vertical direction of the tidal current. Based on our results and considering a tidal-stream energy convertor (TEC) aligned with the current main direction, the main elements of turbulence prone to affect the structure (material fatigue) and to alter power generation would likely be: (i) the streamwise turbulence intensity (I-x), (ii) the shear stress, vw ` <overbar></mml:mover>, (iii) the normal stress, u<mml:mo>' 2<mml:mo accent={''}false{''}><overbar></mml:mover> and (iv) the vertical integral lengthscale (L-z). The streamwise turbulence intensity, (I-x), was found to be higher than that estimated at other tidal energy sites across the world for similar height above bottom. Along the vertical direction, the length (L-z) of the large-scale turbulence eddies was found to be equivalent to the rotor diameter of the TEC Sabella D10. It is considered that the turbulence metrics presented in this paper will be valuable for TECs designers, helping them optimize their designs as well as improve loading prediction through the lifetime of the machines.

AB  - Nowadays, the use of biofuels has become an unavoidable solution to the depletion of fossil fuels and global warming. The controversy over the use of food crops for the production of the first-generation biofuels and deforestation caused by the second-generation ones has forced the transition to the third generation of biofuels, which avoids the use of arable land and edible products, and does not threaten biodiversity. This generation is based on the marine and freshwater biomass, which has the advantages of being abundant or even invasive, easy to cultivate and having a good energetic potential. Bioethanol production from Ulva lactuca, a local marine macroalgae collected from the west coast of Algiers, was examined in this study. Ulva lactuca showed a good energetic potential due to its carbohydrate-rich content: 9.57% of cellulose, 6.9% of hemicellulose and low lignin content of 5.11%. Ethanol was produced following the separate hydrolysis and fermentation process (SHF), preceded by a thermal acid pretreatment at 120 Â°C during 15 min. Enzymatic hydrolysis was performed using a commercial cellulase (Celluclast 1.5 L), which saccharified the cellulose contained in the green seaweed, releasing about 85.01% of the total glucose, corresponding to 7.21 g/L after 96 h of enzymatic hydrolysis at pH 5 and 45 Â°C. About 3.52 g/L of ethanol was produced after 48 h of fermentation using Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 30 Â°C and pH 5, leading to a high ethanol yield of 0.41 g of ethanol/g of glucose.

TI  - Diversity of ocean acidification effects on marine N-2 fixers
JO  - Journal Of Experimental Marine Biology And Ecology
PY  - 2014
VL  - 457
IS  - NA
AB  - Considering the important role of N-2 fixation for primary productivity and CO2 sequestration, it is crucial to assess the response of diazotrophs to ocean acidification. Previous studies on the genus Trichodesmium suggested a strong sensitivity towards ocean acidification. In view of the large functional diversity in N-2 fixers, the objective of this study was to improve our knowledge of the CO2 responses of other diazotrophs. To this end, the single-celled Cyanothece sp. and two heterocystous species, Nodularia spumigena and the symbiotic Calothrix rhizosoleniae, were acclimated to two pCO(2) levels (380 vs. 980 mu atm). Growth rates, cellular composition (carbon, nitrogen and chlorophyll a) as well as carbon and N-2 fixation rates (C-14 incorporation, acetylene reduction) were measured and compared to literature data on different N-2 fixers. The three species investigated in this study responded differently to elevated pCO(2), showing enhanced, decreased as well as unaltered growth and production rates. For instance, Cyanothece increased production rates with pCO(2), which is in line with the general view that N-2 fixers benefit from ocean acidification. Due to lowered growth and production of Nodularia, nitrogen input to the Baltic Sea might decrease in the future. In Calothrix, no significant changes in growth or production could be observed, even though N-2 fixation was stimulated under elevated pCO(2). Reviewing literature data confirmed a large variability in CO2 sensitivity across diazotrophs. The contrasting response patterns in our and previous studies were discussed with regard to the carbonate chemistry in the respective natural habitats, the mode of N-2 fixation as well as differences in cellular energy limitation between the species. The group-specific CO2 sensitivities will impact differently on future biogeochemical cycles of open-ocean environments and systems like the Baltic Sea and should therefore be considered in models estimating climate feedback effects.

TI  - Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) as a Transitional Choice Replacing Marine Conventional Fuels (Heavy Fuel Oil/Marine Diesel Oil), towards the Era of Decarbonisation
JO  - Sustainability
PY  - 2022
VL  - 14
IS  - 24
AB  - As environmental regulations on sulphur emissions become more severe, the maritime sector is looking for alternative solutions. This study evaluates greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction alternatives and their combined ability to decarbonise international transport. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is becoming widely used, reducing CO2 emissions by 20-30 percent, while it has similar action in other emissions such as SOX. Although costs are attractive, methane slip, which depends on the engine type, reduces GHG gains. Replacing conventional fuels such as heavy fuel oil and marine diesel oil with alternative ones is an effective method to decrease SOx emissions. Liquefied natural gas is highly appreciated as an alternative fuel for maritime transportation. In this frame, the possibility of using alternative fuels, such as LNG, to reduce NOx, CO2 and SOx emissions in Heraklion Port, including certain regionally defined waters, over the life of the vessel will also be explored. The study is conducted for ships calling at Heraklion Port and using alternative fuel such as LNG in different modes (cruising, hotelling, manoeuvring). A fuel-based emission reduction factor, rE(if), is defined in relation to the comparison of two different fuels: conventional (heavy oil, marine diesel) and alternative fuels (LNG). The bottom-up method is used for this data analysis. This study, by defining the reduction of several emissions with the use of LNG, indicates that it is actually an efficient transitional fuel to lead international transport to decarbonisation.

AB  - Wetlands are considered as one of the most effective carbon (C) sink among various ecosystems. To substantiate this view, the present investigation was conducted in one of the units of sewage fed East Kolkata wetlands (EKW), a Ramsar site, over a period of 3years. The result revealed that because of high primary productivity due to abundance of primary producers and other sources of C input primarily through sewage influx, there is net positive balance of C in the system. The rate of C accumulation estimated through C budget was 1245.27-2490.55kg C ha(-1) year(-1) while the rate estimated through sediment core analysis came out to be 1584kg C ha(-1) year(-1). The amount of total C deposited up to 15cm depth in sediment was 29.37Mgha(-1), quite higher than the C deposited up to 15cm depth of reference upland soil which was measured at 23.79Mgha(-1). If C burial from this experiment in 55ha is up-scaled for entire EKW of 12,500ha area, then it empirically corresponds to 56.97-113.94 Gg CO2 captured from atmosphere per annum. EKW is not only used for aquaculture production thereby harvesting blue carbon but also has great potential to accumulate C in its sediments and thus helping mitigate climate change.

AB  - The Mangunharjo mangrove ecosystem is one of the areas affected by land degradation because of the creation of ponds. This research evaluated the mangrove potential capacity for carbon storage, particularly in absorbing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the environment. The estimation used allometric equations that employ tree type and diameter at breast height. The carbon content in sediment was also evaluated using the ignition method. Results showed that the estimated value of standing carbon stock in the Mangunharjo mangrove ecosystem is 152.85 ton he. The highest value (i.e., 68.1 ton ha(-1)) is observed in the area near the river, which is dominated by the Avicennia marina species with a density of 733 ind ha(-1). The lowest value (i.e., 34.69 ton ha(-1)) is observed in the area near the residential area with the A. marina species density of 333.26 ind ha(-1). Sediment carbon stocks in all stations amounted to 236.07 ton ha(-1). The amount of carbon in sediment is influenced by the sediment type, vegetation type, and sediment age. The total carbon stock in the Mangunharjo mangrove ecosystem is 388.92 ton which can be categorized as high potential for environmental services, that is, to absorb CO2.

VL  - 10

AB  - In recent years, research into ships has focused on reducing emissions, consuming less energy, and being more efficient. As a result, the maritime industry has been continuing in a green and sustainable direction. Improving the fuel efficiency of ships and the decarbonization of shipping are important issues to reduce fuel consumption and emitted Greenhouse Gas (GHG) amounts. Decarbonization in the shipping industry could be achieved through technical and operational strategies such as Energy Saving Devices (ESDs) to reduce the fuel consumption of new and existing ships. According to the makers, ESDs can optimize fuel efficiency by up to 15\%. This paper reviews the current literature on stern hydrodynamic ESDs, which are mainly used on typical merchant vessels, i.e., bulkers, tankers, and carriers. A comprehensive review is carried out analysing the different available solutions for stern hydrodynamic ESDs, the working principles, the methods used for the design, optimization, and evaluation of the performance improvements, and the relevant issues of these specific ESDs.

JO  - International Journal Of Greenhouse Gas Control
PY  - 2015
VL  - 38
IS  - SI
AB  - This work is focused on results from a recent controlled sub-seabed in situ carbon dioxide (CO2) release experiment carried out during May-October 2012 in Ardmucknish Bay on the Scottish west coast. Three types of pCO(2) sensors (fluorescence, NDIR and ISFET-based technologies) were used in combination with multiparameter instruments measuring oxygen, temperature, salinity and currents in the water column at the epicentre of release and further away. It was shown that distribution of seafloor CO2 emissions features high spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The highest pCO(2) values (similar to 1250 mu atm) were detected at low tide around a bubble stream and within centimetres distance from the seafloor. Further up in the water column, 30-100 cm above the seabed, the gradients decreased, but continued to indicate elevated pCO(2) at the epicentre of release throughout the injection campaign with the peak values between 400 and 740 mu atm. High-frequency parallel measurements from two instruments placed within 1 m from each other, relocation of one of the instruments at the release site and 2D horizontal mapping of the release and control sites confirmed a localized impact from CO2 emissions. Observed effects on the water column were temporary and post-injection recovery took <7 days. A multivariate statistical approach was used to recognize the periods when the system was dominated by natural forcing with strong correlation between variation in pCO(2) and O-2, and when it was influenced by purposefully released CO2. Use of a hydrodynamic circulation model, calibrated with in situ data, was crucial to establishing background conditions in this complex and dynamic shallow water system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Feasibility of the Zero-V: A zero-emissions hydrogen fuel-cell coastal research vessel
JO  - International Journal Of Hydrogen Energy
PY  - 2020
VL  - 45
IS  - 46
AB  - A study is presented to determine the technical, regulatory, and economic feasibility of a coastal research vessel (named the â€œZero-Vâ€) powered solely by hydrogen fuel cells. Feasibility is examined in the context of science mission profiles of particular significance in coastal oceanography that require a modern, capable, general-purpose coastal research vessel. These missions translate into the primary Zero-V vessel requirements against which technical feasibility is assessed. Hull form analysis indicated a trimaran design enables a vessel that can meet all of the space and volume requirements as well as for fitment of the machinery, service, and control spaces necessary for operation of the vessel. To meet speed and range (endurance) requirements, the vessel needs to be constructed of aluminum to reduce weight. The beam (56 feet), length (170 feet) and draft (12 feet) of the vessel enable it to dock at all primary ports of call. With 1800 kW of installed proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel-cell power for primary propulsion, the cruising speed is 10 knots. With 10,900 kg of consumable LH2 stored in two LH2 tanks, the range of the vessel is 2400 nautical miles, with an endurance of 15 days. Both the greenhouse gas (GHG) and criteria pollutant (NOx, HC, PM10) emissions were estimated based on a complete â€œwell-to-wavesâ€ (WTW) analysis. Using renewable hydrogen, the annual WTW GHG emissions predicted for the Zero-V are 91.4% less than those from an equivalent vessel running on conventional diesel fuel. Analysis of the WTW criteria pollutant emissions show that hydrogen PEM fuel-cell technology can reduce these emissions below stringent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Tier 4 marine diesel engine emissions limits regardless of whether the hydrogen is made using natural gas or renewable methods. The capital construction cost is estimated to be ~ $79 M, not unreasonable when compared to other modern diesel-fueled research vessels of similar size and capabilities. The operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs of the Zero-V were estimated to be 7.7% higher than operating the equivalent diesel-fueled vessel at the assumed fuel prices for LH2 made from steam reforming of fossil natural gas. The approach to safety for the Zero-V is described in terms of the arrangement of hazardous areas on the vessel. Regulatory review of the vessel design by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) and the Class society DNV GL found no fundamental or â€œshow-stoppingâ€ design concerns that would prevent eventual deployment of the Zero-V. Overall, this study found it feasible from technical, regulatory, and economic perspectives to design, build and operate a coastal research vessel powered solely by hydrogen fuel cells.

AB  - A novel ship propulsion concept employs natural gas to reduce ship emissions and improve overall ship propulsion efficiency. This concept proposes a serial integration of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and a natural gas engine, while anode-off gas (gas at the fuel cell exhaust) is used in the natural gas engine. This study focusses on SOFC-gas engine integration by experimentally analyzing the effects of adding hydrogen, which is the main combustible component of the fuel cell anode-off gas, in marine natural gas engines. The overall challenge is to employ the anode-off gas to improve the performance of marine natural gas engines. To study the effects of anode-off gas combustion in natural gas engines, experiments with hydrogen addition in a marine natural gas engine of 500 kW rated power were performed. Natural gas was replaced with 10 \% and 20 \% of hydrogen, by volume, without any penalties in terms of output power. We found that the high combustion rate of hydrogen improved combustion stability, which allowed for better air-excess ratio control. Thus allowing leaning to higher air-excess ratios and extending the, otherwise, limited operating window Hydrogen addition also improved brake thermal efficiency by 1.2 \%, while keeping NOx emissions below the maritime emission regulations. The improvement in engine efficiency with a larger operating window may help improve the load-taking capabilities of marine natural gas engines.

JO  - Environmental Science And Technology
PY  - 2015
VL  - 49
IS  - 16
AB  - This paper explores whether a Panama Canal Authority pollution tax could be an effective economic instrument to achieve Emission Control Area (ECA)-like reductions in emissions from ships transiting the Panama Canal. This tariff-based policy action, whereby vessels in compliance with International Maritime Organisation (IMO) ECA standards pay a lower transit tariff than noncompliant vessels, could be a feasible alternative to petitioning for a Panamanian ECA through the IMO. A $4.06/container fuel tax could incentivize ECA-compliant emissions reductions for nearly two-thirds of Panama Canal container vessels, mainly through fuel switching; if the vessel(s) also operate in IMO-defined ECAs, exhaust-gas treatment technologies may be cost-effective. The RATES model presented here compares current abatement technologies based on hours of operation within an ECA, computing costs for a container vessel to comply with ECA standards in addition to computing the Canal tax that would reduce emissions in Panama. Retrofitted open-loop scrubbers are cost-effective only for vessels operating within an ECA for more than 4500 h annually. Fuel switching is the least-cost option to industry for vessels that operate mostly outside of ECA regions, whereas vessels operating entirely within an ECA region could reduce compliance cost with exhaust-gas treatment technology (scrubbers).

TI  - Green energy from marine algae: Biogas production and composition from the anaerobic digestion of Irish seaweed species
JO  - Environmental Technology (united Kingdom)
PY  - 2013
VL  - 34
IS  - 15
AB  - Marine algae have emerged as an alternative feedstock for the production of a number of renewable fuels, including biogas. In addition to energy potential, other characteristics make them attractive as an energy source, including their ability to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2), higher productivity rates than land-based crops and the lack of water use or land competition. For Ireland, biofuels from marine algae can play an important role by reducing imports of fossil fuels as well as providing the necessary energy in rural communities. In this study, five potential seaweed species common in Irish waters, Saccorhiza polyschides, Ulva sp., Laminaria digitata, Fucus serratus and Saccharina latissima, were co-digested individually with bovine slurry. Batch reactors of 120 ml and 1000 ml were set up and incubated at 35Â°C to investigate their suitability for production of biogas. Digesters fed with S. latissima produced the maximum methane yield (335 ml g volatile solids -1 (gVS-1)) followed by S. polyschides with 255 ml gVS-1. L. digitata produced 246 ml gVS -1 and the lowest yields were from the green seaweed Ulva sp. 191 ml gVS-1. The methane and CO2 percentages ranged between 50-72% and 10-45%, respectively. The results demonstrated that the seaweed species investigated are good feedstocks candidates for the production of biogas and methane as a source of energy. Their use on a large-scale process will require further investigation to increase yields and reduce production costs. Â© 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis.

AB  - The maritime industry is in a mindset to save fuel and reduce emissions. How one achieves this end, however, can be a matter of some debate. While substantial industry effort is being placed on things that can be optimized, to achieve real benefit and financial return one must first understand the details about how the vessel consumes propulsive energy during its mission. This paper discusses a rational, simple, and effective systems engineering approach to identify power and fuel demands via computational propulsion analysis of the individual operating modes of a vesselâ€™s duty cycle. It explains sensible consumption metrics that can be used to evaluate and compare different physical systems, strategic plans, or helm decisions. A duty cycle operating mode analysis calculation for a tugboat in multi-role service (as a harbor tug and in long haul ocean barge towing) is demonstrated using COTS software, including examples of design-side and shipboard decision options and consequences.

AB  - The ability to detect and monitor any escape of carbon dioxide (CO2) from sub-seafloor CO2 storage reservoirs is essential for public acceptance of carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a climate change mitigation strategy. Here, we use repeated high-resolution seismic reflection surveys acquired using a chirp profiler mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), to image CO2 gas released into shallow sub-surface sediments above a potential CCS storage site at 120 m water depth in the North Sea. Observations of temporal changes in seismic reflectivity, attenuation, unit thickness and the bulk permeability of sediment were used to develop a four-stage model of the evolution of gas migration in shallow marine sediments: Proto-migration, Immature Migration, Mature Migration, and Pathway Closure. Bubble flow was initially enabled through the propagation of stable fractures but, over time, transitioned to dynamic fractures with an associated step change in permeability. Once the gas injection rate exceeded the rate at which gas could escape the coarser sediments overlying the injection point, gas began to pool along a grain size boundary. This enhanced understanding of the migration of free gas in near-surface sediments will help improve methods of detection and quantification of gas in subsurface marine sediments.

TI  - ADV Preview Based Nonlinear Predictive Control for Maximizing Power Generation of a Tidal Turbine with Hydrostatic Transmission
JO  - Ieee Transactions On Energy Conversion
PY  - 2019
VL  - 34
IS  - 4
AB  - As the development of tidal turbines attracts more and more attention in recent years, reliable design and efficient control of tidal turbines are becoming increasingly important. However, the majority of existing tidal turbines still utilize traditional fixed ratio geared transmissions and the associated control designs focus on simple feedback controllers that use measurements or possibly estimates of the turbine itself or current local tidal profile. Therefore, the measurement and control are inevitably affected by the inherent delay with respect to the current tidal speeds. This paper proposes a novel tidal turbine with continuously variable speed hydrostatic transmissions and a nonlinear predictive controller that uses short-Term predictions of the approaching tidal speed field to enhance the maximum tidal power generations when the tidal speed is below the rated value. The controller is designed based on an offline finite-horizon continuous time minimization of a cost function, and an integral action is incorporated into the control loop to increase the robustness against parameter variations and uncertainties. A smooth second order sliding mode observer is also designed for parameter estimations in the control loop. A 150 kW tidal turbine with hydrostatic transmission is designed and implemented. The results demonstrate that the averaged generator power increases by 6.76% with this preview based nonlinear predictive controller compared with a classical non-predictive controller.

TI  - Underactuated control and analysis of single blade installation using a jackup installation vessel and active tugger line force control
JO  - Marine Structures
PY  - 2023
VL  - 88
IS  - NA
AB  - The assembly and installation costs account for a large share in the overall expenditures of an offshore wind farm project. Single blade installation is suitable for large scale wind turbines due to the lower crane capability requirement and lower transportation time. By introducing active tension control on the tugger lines, an automatic single blade installation approach can accomplish operations in higher sea states, reduce the waiting-on-weather time, and improve the operational efficiency. Compared to early research, a more complicated control objective is achieved in this paper, i.e., a two-tugger-line configuration is applied to stabilize the suspended blade in three degrees of freedom during crane rotation and blade root-hub mating processes. The pulleys on the crane boom, i.e., the ends of the tugger lines, are assumed to be fixedly placed, resulting in tugger line time-varying inclinations. A novel backstepping-like controller is designed and proved. It is able to stabilize the blade around its equilibrium and make it track the desired path. Sensitivity studies are conducted to evaluate the influence of the tugger line inclinations. In addition, the influence of the installed blades on a three-blade horizontal wind turbine with a monopile foundation is discussed. The proposed active control setup improves the installation success rate and reduces the risks for blade impacts that may occur during mating. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Scour Protections for Offshore Foundations of Marine Energy Harvesting Technologies: A Review
JO  - Journal Of Marine Science And Engineering
PY  - 2021
VL  - 9
IS  - 3
AB  - The offshore wind is the sector of marine renewable energy with the highest commercial development at present. The margin to optimise offshore wind foundations is considerable, thus attracting both the scientific and the industrial community. Due to the complexity of the marine environment, the foundation of an offshore wind turbine represents a considerable portion of the overall investment. An important part of the foundation's costs relates to the scour protections, which prevent scour effects that can lead the structure to reach the ultimate and service limit states. Presently, the advances in scour protections design and its optimisation for marine environments face many challenges, and the latest findings are often bounded by stakeholder's strict confidential policies. Therefore, this paper provides a broad overview of the latest improvements acquired on this topic, which would otherwise be difficult to obtain by the scientific and general professional community. In addition, this paper summarises the key challenges and recent advances related to offshore wind turbine scour protections. Knowledge gaps, recent findings and prospective research goals are critically analysed, including the study of potential synergies with other marine renewable energy technologies, as wave and tidal energy. This research shows that scour protections are a field of study quite challenging and still with numerous questions to be answered. Thus, optimisation of scour protections in the marine environment represents a meaningful opportunity to further increase the competitiveness of marine renewable energies.

AB  - International Paint, BMT ARGOSS, and NAPA have jointly called on the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee to work with independent, vessel performance monitoring organizations to develop a standard methodology to determine the energy saving and eco-efficiency impact of clean technologies fitted to new and existing vessels. As fuel prices remain high and likely to increase as new lower sulfur regulations are introduced, ship owners, operators, and charterers have indicated demand for a more accurate analysis of the methods they can use to reduce fuel consumption, costs, and emissions. Tapping into accurate, high-quality, and high-frequency fuel consumption and vessel performance data, based from ships' sensors monitoring engine torque, navigational systems, and the speed log, throughout the service life of a vessel could become a fundamental way of improving operational efficiency of the global shipping fleet.

TI  - Marine microalgal culturing in open pond systems for biodiesel production-Critical parameters
JO  - Journal Of Renewable And Sustainable Energy
PY  - 2016
VL  - 8
IS  - 2
AB  - In the present scenario, petroleum sourced fuel consumption is unsustainable; therefore, there is a high demand for the development of renewable transport fuels for environmental and economic sustainability. Microalgal fuel, with the significant feature of being carbon neutral, serves as one of the potent tools for tackling the fuel crisis. Enormous researches have been explored using fresh water species on biodiesel production; nevertheless, marine species are still in a grey area, even though reported to have higher lipid content. The current review focuses on a wide spectrum of marine microalgal sources with phycology under the criteria of open pond systems for algal oil production. The discussion on the lipid expression in the marine species have been critically analysed through the vital parameters such as solar irradiation, temperature, pH, nutrient pressure, agitation, CO2 supply, culture depth, aeration, etc. The parameters are interdependent and, if scrutinized wisely, could result in enhanced lipid productivity. Therefore, the open pond culture of marine microalgae with top prioritized parameters such as nitrogen stress, pH, and light penetration will be a suitable combination for the efficient and effective biodiesel production.

AB  - International Maritime Organization (IMO) has initialized a new strategy on greenhouse gas (GHG) to reduce 50% of GHG from international shipping by 2050 comparing to 2008. Recently, solutions, like fuel cell and renewable energy, have been proposed by technology providers and ship designers. Battery-powered ship is a solution that can lead to a considerable reduction or even elimination of gaseous emissions, thus limiting fossil fuels consumptions. This paper aims to determine the benefits and drawbacks of marine battery propulsion system by conducting a comparative study using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). It holistic-ally evaluates the performances of the proposed system and the respective conventional one, applied on a 33-meter-long short-route ferry operating on the Thames. The results indicate the battery-powered system instead of marine engines can reduce the environmental impacts and GHG from ships, which fulfils the IMO requirements and proves the emission control potential of battery-powered systems.

TI  - Mitigating the atmospheric CO2 increase and ocean acidification by adding limestone powder to upwelling regions
JO  - Journal Of Geophysical Research-oceans
PY  - 2008
VL  - 113
IS  - C4
AB  - The feasibility of enhancing the absorption of CO2 from the atmosphere by adding calcium carbonate (CaCO3) powder to the ocean and of partially reversing the acidification of the ocean and the decrease in calcite supersaturation resulting from the absorption of anthropogenic CO2 is investigated. CaCO3 could be added to the surface layer in regions where the depth of the boundary between supersaturated and unsaturated water is relatively shallow (250-500 m) and where the upwelling velocity is large (30-300 m a(-1)). The CaCO3 would dissolve within a few 100 m depth below the saturation horizon, and the dissolution products would enter the mixed layer within a few years to decades, facilitating further absorption of CO2 from the atmosphere. This absorption of CO2 would largely offset the increase in mixed layer pH and carbonate supersaturation resulting from the upwelling of dissolved limestone powder. However, if done on a large scale, the reduction in atmospheric CO2 due to absorption of CO2 by the ocean would reduce the amount of CO2 that needs to be absorbed by the mixed layer, thereby allowing a larger net increase in pH and in supersaturation in the regions receiving CaCO3. At the same time, the reduction in atmospheric pCO(2) would cause outgassing of CO2 from ocean regions not subject to addition of CaCO3, thereby increasing the pH and supersaturation in these regions as well. Geographically optimal application of 4 billion t of CaCO3 a(-1) (0.48 Gt C a(-1)) could induce absorption of atmospheric CO2 at a rate of 600 Mt CO2 a(-1) after 50 years, 900 Mt CO2 a(-1) after 100 years, and 1050 Mt CO2 a(-1) after 200 years.

AB  - In order to scientifically assess the impact of land use/land cover changes on blue carbon pool of coastal tidal marsh, it is valuable to determine the changes of ecosystem carbon stock following conversion of coastal marsh to aquaculture ponds. In the Minjiang River estuary zone, we collected the samples of the aboveground and belowground plants, and the soils (0~100cm) from the Phragmites australis, Cyperus malatensis and Spartina alterniflora marshes, and the top 100cm sediment of the aquaculture ponds reclaimed from above three different marshes. The organic carbon content of plants, and soil / sediment samples were measured. The blue carbon storage of P.australis marsh ecosystem, C.malaccensis marsh ecosystem and S.alterniflora marsh ecosystem was (152.85Â±8.88), (151.63Â±6.33), and (155.85Â±10.82)Mg C/hm2, respectively, and the sediment carbon storage of the aquaculture ponds was (112.69Â±4.26), (128.24Â±15.81), and (118.59Â±8.26)Mg C/hm2, respectively. The blue carbon storage of P.australis marsh ecosystem, C.malaccensis marsh ecosystem and S.alterniflora marsh ecosystem decreased by 26.3%, 15.4%, and 23.9%, respectively, resulting in (145.49Â±33.00), (120.66Â±26.49), and (136.76Â±27.61)Mg CO2-eq/hm2 carbon emissions. Our results showed that conversion of coastal marsh into aquaculture ponds greatly decreased ecosystem carbon storage. We suggested that ecological restoration of aquaculture pond into marsh ecosystem will play an important role in coastal wetland carbon sequestration.

VL  - 2019-May
IS  - NA
AB  - The International Energy Agency Ocean Energy Systems (IEA-OES) has identified a target installed capacity worldwide of 300 GW by 2050 [1]. Verdant Power is advancing the Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) industry towards commercial tidal energy and MW-scale array projects through the development of a scalable mount that integrates life-cycle operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) with an environmentally compatible and scalable turbine. The Verdant Power Kinetic Hydropower System (KHPS) is a 5th generation water-to-wire MRE system that utilizes horizontal-axis turbines installed in fast-moving tidal and river currents to generate renewable energy. The Verdant Power TriFrameâ„¢ (TF) mount is a triangular frame mount that supports three KHPS turbines. Verdant will demonstrate this system at the 5m-rotor diameter scale at its Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)-licensed Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy (RITE) Project in New York City's East River, a highly accessible and well-characterized tidal site. The technical development of the TF mount is based on an iterated and integrated design and risk management process, all geared to the evolving suite of International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) marine energy standards and which includes third-party verification of key performance measures. This paper presents an overview of the integrated design process related to innovative mounting systems for tidal energy converters (TECs) that shows potential to reduce capital and operating costs through improved performance, reliability, and maintainability. With support from the US Department of Energy (DOE) and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), Verdant is conducting an Integrated Design Process (IDP) to develop, build, install, and operate a TF mounting structure supporting three Verdant Power Generation 5 (Gen5) KHPS turbines at the RITE Project. This full-scale, open-water project also includes a demonstration of a periodic O&amp;M cycle. Along with technical performance monitoring, capital and operational cost data will also be compiled. The IDP integrates the capital mount design with the procedures and costs of the associated on-water work (OWW) operations (deployment, installation, retrieval, replacement). The IDP utilizes a risk analysis and management framework for the key components and requires close coordination with partner structural engineers, marine contractors, as well as the system supply chain for fabrication, assembly, and deployment facilities. Numerical modeling tools, component testing, and a failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) are utilized, following the guidance outlined in International Standards and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Risk Management Framework. The entire process is iterated, with updated feedback from all participants, resulting in an optimized design that addresses project metrics and risk mitigation. Using IDP, a TEC mounting system design has been achieved that minimizes the time and cost on-water while ensuring structural, environmental, and operational performance. The application of consensus-based International Standards and a clear risk management framework is highlighted throughout the design process and is critical to ensuring system performance and increasing stakeholder confidence across the industry. Beyond Verdant's RITE project, as the marine energy industry advances, most near-term deployments will likely be at sites driven by supportive national and regional energy and funding policies. The utilization of an IDP, in a standards-based environment, offers a means to develop cost-effective full-scale solutions to capture the opportunities for MRE and specifically, TECs to produce competitive renewable energy.

JO  - Energy Conversion And Management
PY  - 2014

AB  - The issues associated with Ireland's over reliance on fossil fuels to meet energy demands have sparked an interest in renewable energy. Renewable energy resources typically are intermittent and vary significantly in energy intensity. Tidal energy however has the advantage of predictability over large time scales and high power densities. A study of Ireland's tidal-current-energy resource has identified several viable sites. As part of this resource assessment, Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers were installed at two locations along Ireland's west coast, at a site in the Bulls Mouth and the Shannon Estuary. The Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers measured tidal current speed and direction at 30 min intervals over a 30 day period at a range of depths through the water column. This is the first time the measured data appears in the literature as it has only recently been made public. This paper presents tidal current speed and direction, frequency of occurrence of speed, tidal roses at several depths through the water column, and a comparison of theoretical tidal-current-speed profiles with measured data for a site in the Bulls Mouth and in the Shannon Estuary. The paper compares power density at both sites over a lunar month and also proposes a best fit power law exponent with the measured data through the water column. Finally, the paper presents an energetic performance comparison for a tidal current turbine operating at both sites. The data presented in this paper can be used in the design process to estimate the hydrodynamic and structural performance of a tidal current turbine operating under real-life conditions. The data can also be used to assess different control strategies and to design a tidal current turbine to suit the site-specific characteristics. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

JO  - Science Of The Total Environment

AB  - Forested coastal wetlands are globally important systems sequestering carbon and intercepting nitrogen pollution from nutrient-rich river systems. Coastal wetlands that have suffered extensive disturbance are the target of comprehensive restoration efforts. Accurate assessment of restoration success requires detailed mechanistic understanding of wetland soil biogeochemical functioning across restoration chrono-sequences, which remains poorly understood for these sparsely investigated systems. This study investigated denitrification and greenhouse gas fluxes in mangrove and Melaleuca forest soils of Vietnam, using the 15N-Gas flux method. Denitrification-derived N2O was significantly higher from Melaleuca than mangrove forest soils, despite higher potential rates of total denitrification in the mangrove forest soils (8.1 ng N g-1 h-1) than the Melaleuca soils (6.8 ng N g-1 h-1). Potential N2O and CO2 emissions were significantly higher from the Melaleuca soils than from the mangrove soils. Disturbance and subsequent recovery had no significant effect on N biogeochemistry except with respect to the denitrification product ratio in the mangrove sites, which was highest from the youngest mangrove site. Potential CO2 and CH4 fluxes were significantly affected by restoration in the mangrove soils. The lowest potential CO2 emissions were observed in the mid-age plantation and potential CH4 fluxes decreased in the older forests. The mangrove system, therefore, may remove excess N and improve water quality with low greenhouse gas emissions, whereas in Melaleucas, increased N2O and CO2 emissions also occur. These emissions are likely balanced by higher carbon stocks observed in the Melaleuca soils. These mechanistic insights highlight the importance of ecosystem restoration for pollution attenuation and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from coastal wetlands. Restoration efforts should continue to focus on increasing wetland area and function, which will benefit local communities with improved water quality and potential for income generation under future carbon trading.

AB  - Diesel engines have proven themselves powerful, reliable and efficient. However, emissions from fuel combustion of diesel engine always leave by-products of oxides of nitrogen, unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in the exhaust gas. Therefore, environmentalists call for cleaner technology to be used in place of conventional diesel engine. The alternative option of diesel-electric engine is an applicable modern technology that generates lower air emissions. The diesel-electric engine for marine vessel offers significantly higher energy efficiency and lower air emissions, compared to the traditional diesel engine. Marine diesel-electric engine is a hybrid engine that uses diesel fuel to generate mechanical torque and transform to electrical power for driving motor and propels the ship. The developed electrical systems, where the diesel engine can be operated on a variable speed giving a huge potential in fuel saving. The Gensets operate in variable speed mode, where the rpm can be adjusted for minimum fuel oil consumption according to the system load. It also allows the integration of energy storage sources like batteries. The energy storage sources reduce the transient loads on the diesel engines. A petroleum company has therefore launched a green logistics program and adopt diesel-electric engine into the marine logistic process to be an initiative of the environmental friendly offshore operation. The Anchor Handling Tug Supply (AHTS) operate in the Gulf of Thailand for supporting offshore petroleum production. Since 2012, more than 50% of AHTS operated by diesel engines have been replaced by diesel-electric engines. By implementation of the green logistics program, in 2013 our marine fleet can decreased up to 7,100 m3 of Marine Gas Oil (MGO) consumption, whilst also reduces totally 22,000 tons of CO2e emission. Divided from overall picture, the replacement power driven of AHTS by diesel-electric engines contributed to the fuel saving at 4,000 m3 of MGO or 56 % of total MGO reduction. In economical perspective, a company has an opportunity to cut off fuel expense for 206 MMTHB or 6.9 MMUSD per annual. This could reflect a company determination to stay at forefront of the industry as the leading petroleum exploration and production company driven by green practices throughout our operation and supply chains.

Numerical approach was made to reveal the differences of flow physics between 2-D estimation and rigorous 3-D simulation. It was shown that the 3-D effects were dominant mainly due to the variation of tip vortices around the tip region of rotor blade, causing the loss of lift for the reduction of torque for rotating turbine blade. A VAT with supporting circular discs at both ends spanwisely was then proposed to reduce the three-dimensionality and increase the structural strength as well as the power coefficient.

AB  - Anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases could lead to undesirable effects on oceans in coming centuries. Drawing on recommendations published by the German Advisory Council on Global Change, levels of unacceptable global marine change (so-called guardrails) are defined in terms of global mean temperature, sea level rise, and ocean acidification. A global-mean climate model {[}the Aggregated Carbon Cycle, Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model (ACC2)] is coupled with an economic module {[}taken from the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy Model (DICE)] to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis to derive CO2 emission pathways that both minimize abatement costs and are compatible with these guardrails. Additionally, the ``tolerable windows approach{''} is used to calculate a range of CO2 emissions paths that obey the guardrails as well as a restriction on mitigation rate. Prospects of meeting the global mean temperature change guardrail (2 degrees and 0.2 degrees C decade(-1) relative to preindustrial) depend strongly on assumed values for climate sensitivity: at climate sensitivities >3 degrees C the guardrail cannot be attained under any CO2 emissions reduction strategy without mitigation of non-CO2 greenhouse gases. The ocean acidification guardrail (0.2 unit pH decline relative to preindustrial) is less restrictive than the absolute temperature guardrail at climate sensitivities >2.5 degrees C but becomes more constraining at lower climate sensitivities. The sea level rise and rate of rise guardrails (1 m and 5 cm decade(-1)) are substantially less stringent for ice sheet sensitivities derived in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report, but they may already be committed to violation if ice sheet sensitivities consistent with semiempirical sea level rise projections are assumed.

AB  - As world trade grows, fuel prices increase, and International Maritime Organization (IMO) emissions requirements tighten, there is more demand for the marine industry to employ innovative means of reducing the fuel consumption and emissions of shipping vessels. The main engines of large shipping vessels produce a large quantity of low temperature heat, but this valuable heat energy is transferred to cooling systems and rejected to the oceans as waste. At the same time, the electrical needs of shipping vessels are sustained by burning diesel fuel to run generators. Calnetix Technologies, in partnership with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, has developed the Hydrocurrent (TM) 125EJW Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), a modularized system capable of absorbing the waste heat of main engine jacket water and converting it into grid-quality electric power. By combining this renewable source with the existing non-renewable source (engine genets) a unique renewable-non-renewable hybrid power system is realized with minimal changes to overall ship power train. This novel hybrid system can be applied to all new and existing ships and allow for further integration into ship systems with available waste heat. Shipping vessels such as tankers, bulk carriers, and container vessels are typically equipped with a category 3 marine diesel engine for main propulsion. A 30 MW engine, a most common engine size, utilizes 200-300 m(3)/hr of jacket water regulated to a heated temperature of 80-95 C. When integrated into the jacket water and sea water loops, the ORC can produce up to 125 kW of gross grid-quality electric power. This adds an immense benefit to the ship. To produce the same amount of power, a diesel generator consumes as much as 250 metric tons of diesel fuel per year, generates emissions, and requires significant maintenance. Calnetix Technologies has leveraged its core technologies to develop the ORC into a reliable, high efficiency, compact and modular design. The turbo-generator or Integrated Power Module (IPM) is a hermetically sealed, high speed radial turbine coupled to a permanent magnet generator supported by magnetic bearings. Power from the IPM is converted by a high efficiency power converter supplying the ship with reliable power. The integrated design of the ORC along with the sophistication of its controls systems ensures essential ship functions are undisturbed under all conditions. The ORC is designed to comply with Nippon Kaiji Kyokai and Lloyd's Register marine regulations and sea trials are anticipated to take place in 2015.

AB  - Global industrialisation and overexploitation of fossil fuels significantly impact greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in global warming and other environmental problems. Hence, investigations on capturing, storing, and utilising atmospheric CO2 create novel technologies. Few microorganisms, microalgae, and macroalgae utilise atmospheric CO2 for their growth and reduce atmospheric CO2 levels. Activated carbon and biochar from biomasses also capture CO2. Nanomaterials such as metallic oxides, metal-organic frameworks, and MXenes illustrate outstanding adsorption characteristics, and convert CO2 to carbon-neutral fuels, creating a balance between CO2 production and elimination, thus zeroing the carbon footprint. The need for a paradigm shift from fossil fuels and promising technologies on renewable energies, carbon capture mechanisms, and carbon sequestration techniques that help reduce CO2 emissions for a better tomorrow are reviewed to achieve the world's sustainable development goals. The challenges and possible solutions with future perspectives are also discussed. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Increasingly stringent environmental policies are causing sea vessels to look at ways to adapt to reduce emissions. Thankfully, as marine operators explore new ship designs and technologies for achieving cleaner operations, they are also realizing other benefits from hybrid drives and energy storage solutions-including improved safety, reliability and cost savings. The technology has undergone significant advances across a wide range of marine applications over the past several years. The modernization of the ship would generate significant fuel savings, but the overall advantages would stem from energy storage. The ability to use energy reserves generated from the new technology would enable modernization with advanced, power-hungry weapons systems. The US Navy sources indicate hybrid-electric drives will increase vessel mission efficiency by allowing increased time at posts. Adding propulsion-derived ship service, or PDSS, to the HED increases the gains to 12 to 15 percent.
