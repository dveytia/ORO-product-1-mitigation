AB  - Artificial structures in the marine environment may have direct and/or indirect impact on the behaviour and space use of mobile foragers. This study explores whether environmental and physical features in the North Sea-including artificial structures (wrecks, wind turbines, cables, and oil and gas structures) were associated with local abundance of three fish species: cod (Gadus morhua), plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), and thornback ray (Raja clavata). Generalized additive models (GAMS) were used to compare distributions between data collected by fisheries surveys and electronic tags. Distributions of cod, plaice, and ray were correlated with environmental variables including temperature, depth, and substrate, matching findings from previous studies. All species showed seasonal increases in their abundance in areas with high densities of artificial structures, including oil and gas platforms and wrecks. Independent of whether fish purposefully associate with these features or whether structures happen to coincide with locations frequented by these populations, the strong association suggests that greater consideration needs to be given to regulation of habitat alterations, including decommissioning.

TI  - Blue carbon in area-based coastal and marine management schemesâ€“a review
JO  - Journal Of The Indian Ocean Region
PY  - 2019
VL  - 15
IS  - 2
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems are diverse and highly productive coastal habitats (mangroves, seagrasses, and tidal marshes) that sequester large quantities of carbon and provide a suite of important ecosystem services (â€˜co-benefitsâ€™) for humans and the environment. These ecosystems are being threatened globally due to land-use change driven by expanding agriculture, aquaculture, coastal development, and pollution. Climatic impacts further threaten the resilience, functionality, and adaptability of blue carbon ecosystems. â€˜Marine protected areasâ€™ (MPAs) provide a statutory approach for protecting coastal and marine ecosystems, yet are unlikely to meet â€˜additionalityâ€™ requirements. Whereas other effective conservation measures (OECMs) including community-based â€˜locally managed marine areasâ€™ (LMMAs) provide opportunities to enhance blue carbon conservation and restoration efforts. LMMAs likely deliver additional sequestration, although ensuring â€˜permanenceâ€™ of carbon stocks may be more difficult to achieve. This review summarizes key approaches of blue carbon monitoring; governance systems; policy instruments; and investment pathways for conservation and restoration.

AB  - In 2016 a controlled release experiment was jointly conducted by Shell and Statoil at the Oseberg PRM installation to evaluate the possibility of using passive seismic interferometry methods to detect and locate CO2 or hydrocarbon gas emissions to sea. The intention was to efficiently monitor CO2 storage sites, as well as ensuring safe operations and early hydrocarbon leak detection at producing oil fields. In contrast to leak detection systems based on active sonar technology, this method would leverage existing permanent reservoir monitoring (PRM) for both reservoir and containment monitoring purposes without requiring additional source mobilization. The interferometry results showed no clear and easily detectable effects from the generated bubble curtain. Potential reasons for this range from non-stationary vessel noise, location and strength of the line source, and large number of fish attracted by the release.

JO  - Journal Of The American Water Resources Association

VL  - 36
IS  - 2
AB  - Wetlands exist in a transition zone between aquatic and terrestrial environments which can be altered by subtle changes in hydrology. Twentieth century climate records show that the United States is generally experiencing a trend towards a wetter, warmer climate; some climate models suggest that this trend will continue and possibly intensify over the next 100 years. Wetlands that are most likely to be affected by these and other potential changes (e.g., sea-level rise) associated with atmospheric carbon enrichment include permafrost wetlands, coastal and estuarine wetlands, peatlands, alpine wetlands, and prairie pothole wetlands. Potential impacts range from changes in community structure to changes in ecological function, and from extirpation to enhancement. Wetlands (particularly boreal peatlands) play an important role in the global carbon cycle, generally sequestering carbon in the form of biomass, methane, dissolved organic material and organic sediment. Wetlands that are drained or partially dried can become a net source of methane and carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, serving as a positive biotic feedback to global warming. Policy options for minimizing the adverse impacts of climate change on wetland ecosystems include the reduction of current anthropogenic stresses, allowing for inland migration of coastal wetlands as sea-level rises, active management to preserve wetland hydrology, and a wide range of other management and restoration options.

TI  - Assessing Energy Saving and Atmospheric Emission Reduction Opportunities in Marine Shipping Sector: an Empirical Result from Container Liners
JO  - NANA
PY  - 2009
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - For an industry where fuel accounts for at least 30\% of its operating costs, cutting fuel consumption would achieve a major cost reduction. At the same time, this would reduce the marine shipping industry's impact on the environment through reduced emission of SO(x), NO(x), CO(2) and other fuel-related pollutants. Energy conservation and efficiency, or carried even further, utilization of clean renewable energy to replace fossil fuels, is now the most important challenge in the energy application by the industry. Various energy efficiency improvement measures have been suggested by the industry experts, for both new builds and existing vessels. These measures may require significant capital commitment. On the other hand, a well-managed energy system has the potential to save energy requirement of a ship by at least 10\%. It is therefore very important to determine, in light of economic cost and benefits, which one, or which combination, of management and technology alternatives is most promising and shall be applied first. This study is a systematic three-year study-to assess alternatives of reducing fuel consumption onboard merchant ships, with an analysis of the effects of such changes on the ship owner's costs. Starting from current energy practice on board typical merchant ships, the assessment will be carried on to alternative energy technology as well. As the first-stage result, this report documents an investigation of how operating practices affect fuel consumption on board merchant vessels. Actual data obtained from the abstract logs of ten trans-ocean container liners covering three years are used to develop a multivariate model to estimate the elasticity of various factors related to operating practice on the fuel consumption. An assessment is then carried out on possible fuel consumption reduction and cost savings that may result from changes in operating practices. The result confirms, based on actual voyaging data, fuel saving potentials from ship speed reduction and weather routing, two strategies most often suggested by the ship specialists. The study postulates also possible energy efficiency enhancement via shortening planned maintenance intervals of major energy consumers on board, especially of items such as main engine pistons and turbo chargers. However, this preliminary result fails to provide an empirical support to the postulation.

AB  - Study on the Carbon dioxide, CO2 flux was conducted from the intensive shrimp farming Sail Terengganu which applying Biofloc Technology system (BFT) started from March until the end of July subjected to different Day of Culture (DOC) of shrimp ponds. The study was done to identify either the shrimp culture pond applying BFT contribute as the carbon sources or help in sequestrated CO2 in the farm and local area. C: N ratio of 10: 1 was applied to remove the nitrogenous waste in the ponds. Water parameters were analyzed using YSI multiprobe 556 and the Total Inorganic Carbon was analyzed using TOC-L SHIMADZU 5000A machine. The carbon flux (CO2 from water to atmosphere) and the partial pressure of CO2, pCO(2) were calculated and analyzed using CO2 SYS software. About 52 different DOC of shrimps cultured ponds were analyzed for it carbon emission. The results showed a mean CO2 flux about 20.78 +/- 21.28 mmol m(-2)d(-1) and mean partial pressure, CO2 about 785.8 +/- 804.71 mu atm respectively. The pCO(2) were in ranges between 18.7 mu atm to 3049.7 mu atm and were identified that 13 out of 52 ponds have the pCO(2) > 1000 mu atm, 12 ponds have pCO(2)> 500 mu atm to 900 mu atm and 27 ponds have pCO(2) < 400 mu atm which still present the atmospheric equilibrium (360 mu atm) suggested that the most of the shrimp pond still available as carbon sinker even though some of the pond act as sources of atmospheric CO2 . Larger size of shrimp cultured mostly around DOC 80 and above recognized tend to produce higher pCO(2) up to > 1000 mu atm- 3000 mu atm (DOC102 produced pCO(2)of 1639.03 mu atm; DOC 86 produced pCO(2) of 2324.9 mu atm; DOC94 produced pCO 2 of 3049. mu atm; DOC95 produced pCO(2) of 2940.6 mu atm and DOC97 produced pCO(2) of 1108.6 mu atm). This might be due to more production of CO2 from respiration of large shrimp and the heterotrophic activity came from the more excessive of shrimp excretion produced by larger size shrimp as compared to smaller size of shrimp cultured respectively. Increase of pCO(2) will lead to the increases of CO(2)in the atmosphere as can be proved by the relationship of pCO(2) and CO2 in dry air, which well correlated (r(2) = 1 of the linear regression) and for CO2 flux with pCO(2) relationship also were well correlated (r(2) = 0.999 of the linear regression) with slope of respectively 1.040 and 0.026. The escape of CO(2)to the atmosphere was identified come from the heterotrophic activities in the shrimp pond that applying BFT. This BFT is known as bioremediation agent and dominated by heterotrophic bacterial to synthesize the organic carbon loaded and the excessive protein loaded from uneaten feed in the shrimp pond. The heterotrophic activity from the biofloc organisms plus the respiration from the large size of shrimp and microbial in the ponds was recognized as the contributor of CO2 flux in the farming area.

AB  - The results of a study carried out to determine the modification of wave climate around an array of open chambered structures, which could represent an array of wave power devices are presented in this paper. The wave-structure interaction is studied using the Boussinesq wave model within the MIKE 21 suite software. The spacing between two adjacent structures within the array is varied from 1S to 5S, where S is equal to 20 m. The effect of varying the spacing between individual structures and the resulting wave reflection and transmission around the array is illustrated using simulated random waves. The results show that the degree of reflection and transmission mainly depends on the spacing between individual structures and the peak wave periods. The maximum increase in significant wave height due to wave reflection in front of the array reached about 39% and the maximum reduction in significant wave height downstream the array is found to be about 41%. The results presented in this paper should be of interest to the wave energy industry. Copyright Â© 2010 by ASME.

AB  - The voltage source converter based high voltage direct current transmission (VSC-HVDC) technology has become the inevitable development of the long-distance and large capacity transmission of offshore wind farms. However, the fault characteristics of the VSC-HVDC power system with the offshore wind farm have changed fundamentally because both sides of the AC line are power electronic power sources. Severe AC fault near the converter station may cause the blocking of the converter. This directly results in the short duration of fault current during AC faults, and conventional AC line protection faces serious problems of the incorrect operation. In order to solve this problem, a novel fast AC protection based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) was proposed. The Hankel matrix for fault current on both sides of the AC line has been constructed. Since the Hankel matrix can quickly reflect the singularity of signal and its derivative, and the SVD method can use short time window to extract waveform features, the fast fault identification was realized. The proposed protection can use the fault features before the blocking of the flexible DC converter to reliably identify the fault, so as to solve the problem of incorrect operation caused by the disappearance of the fault features of the traditional protection. A detailed model of VSC-HVDC system with offshore wind farms was built in PSCAD, and the effectiveness of the proposed protection was verified by simulation. The simulation results show that the proposed method can identify all kinds of faults quickly and reliably. The fault identification time is less than 5ms, which solves the incorrect operation problem of conventional protection. Â© 2020 Chin. Soc. for Elec. Eng.

AB  - Atlantic Canada is a relatively sparsely populated region with a few large urban centres and many small communities. Many of these communities rely on secondary treatment plants for treatment and disposal of domestic wastes. However, with a generally low tax base and a small pool of technically qualified personnel, maintenance on the plants is often of low quality so that their performance deteriorates after a few years of operation. In this paper the argument is advanced that ocean outfalls provide a more satisfactory means of treating and disposing of domestic wastes in such cases. Details are provided to confirm the low level to which some plants perform; and the design, installation, and postconstruction monitoring of a small ocean outfall are described to show the advantages of this alternative.

AB  - In this work, the effect of biodegradable polymers, i.e. pectin (PC), sodium-carboxymethyl cellulose (Na-CMC), tapioca starch (TS) and dextran (DX) on thermodynamics and kinetics of CO2 hydrates are evaluated on sapphire hydrate reactor. The CO2 hydrate liquid vapour equilibrium (HLWVE) data is evaluated in the presence of biopolymers (1.5 wt\%) using isochoric T-cycle method at temperature and pressure ranging from 278.7 to 283.0 K and 23 to 4.3 MPa respectively. The effect of biopolymers on HLWVE curve is reported by measuring average increment temperature (AT). The constant cooling method is used to evaluate the kinetics of CO2 hydrates at 4.3 MPa in the presence of biopolymers (0.12-1.5 wt\%) at 274.15 K and 277.15 K. The inhibition effect of biopolymers on the kinetics of CO2 hydrate is reported by measuring induction time, hydrate formation rate and amount of gas consumed. The kinetic inhibition strength of biopolymers is compared with poly-N-vinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and with two non-commercial inhibitors, i.e. glycine and tetra-methyl ammonium chloride (TMACI) through relative inhibition strength (RIS). Results reveal that DX shows maximum increment temperature of 0.36 K. While PC and Na-CMC delayed CO2 hydrate nucleation for 423 and 181 min respectively. Additionally, biodegradation study on biopolymers indicates that, compared to PVP, biopolymers are easily biodegradable and show potential for gas hydrate offshore applications.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 189
IS  - NA
AB  - With the emergence of deep learning in the last years, new opportunities arose in Earth observation research. Nevertheless, they also brought with them new challenges. The data-hungry training processes of deep learning models demand large, resource expensive, annotated datasets and partly replaced knowledge-driven approaches so that model behaviour and the final prediction process became a black box. The proposed SyntEO approach enables Earth observation researchers to automatically generate large deep learning ready datasets by merging existing and procedural data. SyntEO does this by including expert knowledge in the data generation process in a highly structured manner to control the automatic image and label generation by employing an ontology. In this way, fully controllable experiment environments are set up, which support insights in the model training on the synthetic datasets. Thus, SyntEO makes the learning process approachable, which is an important cornerstone for explainable machine learning. We demonstrate the SyntEO approach by predicting offshore wind farms in Sentinel-1 images on two of the worlds largest offshore wind energy production sites. The largest generated dataset has 90,000 training examples. A basic convolutional neural network for object detection, that is only trained on this synthetic data, confidently detects offshore wind farms by minimising false detections in challenging environments. In addition, four sequential datasets are generated, demonstrating how the SyntEO approach can precisely define the dataset structure and influence the training process. SyntEO is thus a hybrid approach that creates an interface between expert knowledge and data-driven image analysis. Â© 2022 The Authors

AB  - Offshore wind farms are becoming increasingly common in the coastal margins of marine ecosystems worldwide. Yet, the effects that wind farm structures have on fish populations remain unclear. To explore potential effects, a meta-analysis of studies that have examined the abundance of finfish inside of wind farms compared to nearby reference sites was conducted. Using well-established meta-analytic methods, the overall effect size across all studies was calculated, and then changes in effect size for soft-bottom and complex-bottom oriented species were explored in association with several covariates including characteristics of the wind farm (depth, distance from shore, wind farm age), the sampling design (season, gear type, and distance from the turbine sampled), and ecosystem level characteristics (functional feeding group and fishing presence/absence). The overall effect size was positive and significantly different from zero, indicating greater abundance of fish inside of wind farms. Likewise, positive and significant effect sizes were noted for several covariates for both soft-bottom and complex-bottom species. The findings of this study underscore the need for regional, national, and international collaboration on monitoring approaches and data sharing in order to develop a more holistic understanding of how offshore wind farms affect living marine resources.

TI  - Marine ecosystem modeling beyond the box: Using GIS to study carbon fluxes in a coastal ecosystem
JO  - Ambio
PY  - 2006
VL  - 35
IS  - 8
AB  - Studies of carbon fluxes in marine ecosystems are often done by using box model approaches with basin side boxes, or highly resolved 3D models, and an emphasis on the pelagic component of the ecosystem. Those approaches work well in the ocean proper, but can give rise to considerable problems when applied to coastal systems, because of the scale of certain ecological niches and the fact that benthic organisms are the dominant functional group of the ecosystem. In addition, 3D models require an extensive modeling effort. In this project, an intermediate approach based on a high resolution (20x20 m) GIS data-grid has been developed for the coastal ecosystem in the Laxemar area (Baltic Sea, Sweden) based on a number of different site investigations. The model has been developed in the context of a safety assessment project for a proposed nuclear waste repository, in which the fate of hypothetically released radionuclides from the planned repository is estimated. The assessment project requires not only a good understanding of the ecosystem dynamics at the site, but also quantification of stocks and flows of matter in the system. The data-grid was then used to set up a carbon budget describing the spatial distribution of biomass, primary production, net ecosystem production and thus where carbon sinks and sources are located in the area. From these results, it was clear that there was a large variation in ecosystem characteristics within the basins and, on a larger scale, that the inner areas are net producing and the outer areas net respiring, even in shallow phytobenthic communities. Benthic processes had a similar or larger influence on carbon fluxes as advective processes in inner areas, whereas the opposite appears to be true in the outer basins. As many radionuclides are expected to follow the pathways of organic matter in the environment, these findings enhance our abilities to realistically describe and predict their fate in the ecosystem.

AB  - 90% of traded goods are transported by ship, the vast majority of which are propelled by diesel engines with an energy efficiency of no more than 50%. Among the developments to increase it, waste heat recovery (WHR) technologies still have room to increase overall efficiency. This study looks into the feasibility of recovering waste heat radiated by the block of a large marine diesel engine. An energy, exergy, economic and environmental (4E) assessment is presented. The analysis identifies the amount of heat from the block which is possible to recover and looks into the cost and CO2 emissions reduction gained when waste energy is reused. A cement carrier vessel propelled by two four-stroke engines with 3000 kW nominal rating is used as case study vessel. From onboard measurements and fluids analysis, results unveil the overall heat radiated from engine block and coolers to be 14.93% of total. Scale factor makes available up to 369 kW of radiated heat. Fuel savings achieved by engine block heat recovery will lead to reductions of 3.31% of the total CO2 and 8.33% of the specific NOx gases emitted. Technological means of heat recovery can range from the temper of hot water to use in vessel's accommodation to the recharge of electric batteries by means of thermoelectric generators.

AB  - Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models are increasingly being used to simulate the flow through large wind farms to investigate scenarios with significant wake losses. This study investigates some of the effects caused by combining multiple simulation runs to represent the wide directional bin sizes sometimes required to ensure significant quantities of validation data and to account for wake meandering. CFD simulation results are combined using three different methods for six different directional bin sizes and compared against measurements from the Nysted offshore wind farm. Results show only small variation between averaging the model outputs uniformly or according to measured directional frequencies, whilst utilising a normal distribution reduces the variation between bin sizes. In addition, the greatest variation between results from combined multiple simulations compared to results from a single simulation occurs at the third turbine in a row. It is found that combined CFD results for the larger bin sizes are more accurate than the results for smaller bin sizes, when compared to the measured dataset with corresponding directional bin sizes.

Furthermore, it is expected that by 2020, several dozens of large offshore wind farms (LOWFs) will be built in the Baltic, Irish and North seas. These LOWFs will be constituted of a considerable amount of wind turbines (WTs) packed together. Due to shadowing effects between turbines, the power production is reduced, resulting in a decreased wind farm efficiency. Hence, when LOWFs are considered, wake losses reduction is an important optimization goal that needs to be considered. This work presents a clustering approach to optimize the energy production of LOWFs through a genetic algorithm (GA). The method consists of a turbine clustering strategy where the optimal wind farm layout is obtained in different steps. The number of turbines used in each step is increased until all turbine locations have been optimized. The results demonstrate the method effectiveness. A computational time decrease and a reduction of the problem search space are observed when compared to the standard optimization strategy, without jeopardizing the quality of the optimal layouts achieved.

TI  - Simulating and Quantifying Multiple Natural Subsea CO2 Seeps at Panarea Island (Aeolian Islands, Italy) as a Proxy for Potential Leakage from Subseabed Carbon Storage Sites

PY  - 2019
VL  - 53
IS  - 17
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (CCS) has been discussed as a potentially significant mitigation option for the ongoing climate warming. Natural CO2 release sites serve as natural laboratories to study subsea CO2 leakage in order to identify suitable analytical methods and numerical models to develop best-practice procedures for the monitoring of subseabed storage sites. We present a new model of bubble (plume) dynamics, advection-dispersion of dissolved CO2, and carbonate chemistry. The focus is on a medium-sized CO2 release from 294 identified small point sources around Panarea Island (South-East Tyrrhenian Sea, Aeolian Islands, Italy) in water depths of about 40-50 m. This study evaluates how multiple CO2 seep sites generate a temporally variable plume of dissolved CO2. The model also allows the overall flow rate of CO2 to be estimated based on field measurements of pH. Simulations indicate a release of -6900 t y-1 of CO2 for the investigated area and highlight an important role of seeps located at &gt;20 m water depth in the carbon budget of the Panarea offshore gas release system. This new transport-reaction model provides a framework for understanding potential future leaks from CO2 storage sites. Â© 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The solutions to today's energy challenges need to be explored through alternative, renewable and clean energy sources to enable a diverse national energy resource plan. An extremely abundant and promising source of energy exists in the world's oceans. Ocean energy exists in the forms of wave, tidal, marine currents, thermal (temperature gradient) and salinity. Among these forms, significant opportunities and benefits have been identified in the area of ocean wave energy extraction, i.e., harnessing the motion of the ocean waves, and converting that motion into electrical energy. This paper presents the fundamentals of ocean wave energy, and also a summary of the wave energy research being conducted at Oregon State University. This paper is intended to serve as an introduction to wave energy for scientists and engineers, particularly those with a wind energy background. Â© 2009 IEEE.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration via Biomineralization: Processes, Applications and Future Directions
JO  - NANA
PY  - 2019
VL  - 37
IS  - NA
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from anthropogenic and natural sources contribute to greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change and variability. In recent years, microbially-induced biomineralization of CO2 to precipitate calcium carbonate has been widely explored as a potential strategy to sequester carbon. Several microorganisms occurring in marine, lacustrine and terrestrial ecosystems, including cyanobacteria have capacity to sequester carbon dioxide via biomineralization. Similarly, a number of plant species sequester carbon dioxide through biomineralization. The objectives of this chapter are: (1) to summarize the processes and mechanisms of microbially- and plant-mediated biomineralization, (2) highlight potential applications of biomineralization in CO2 sequestration, and (3) highlight key knowledge gaps and future research directions. Microbially-mediated calcium carbonate precipitation occurs via three main mechanisms: (1) microbially-controlled, (2) microbially-induced, and (3) biologically-influenced biomineralization. Several metabolic processes control biomineralization, including: (1) urea hydrolysis, (2) activity of carbonic anhydrase, (3) microbial reduction of Fe(III), (4) photosynthesis by cyanobacteria fixes CO2, and (5) sulphate reduction. Microbial mats and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) also play a critical role in microbially-mediated biomineralization. Plant species such as the oxalogenic iroko tree (Milicia excelsa) common in coastal tropical Africa, and several acacia species in Australia have been reported to sequester carbon dioxide via the oxalate-carbonate pathway. Calcium carbonate has a longer residence time in the order of millennia, thus is a more stable carbon pool than organic carbon in soils and live biomass. Accordingly, calcium carbonate formed via biomineralization serves a dual function: (1) in carbon capture and storage systems, microbially mediated biomineralization is used as a benign sealant to avoid escape of CO2 directly injected into deep geological systems, and (2) both microbially-and plant-mediated biomineralization sequester CO2, thus reducing its concentration in the atmosphere. For example, an 80 year-old iroko tree is estimated to sequester 500 kg of carbon in its trunk, and approximately 1000 kg of carbon in the surrounding soil, giving a total of 1500 kg of carbon. Microbially-mediated biomineralization is also used in construction materials, cementation and stabilization of porous materials, sub-surface barriers, aquacultural ponds, industrial filler materials, hydraulic control and environmental remediation. Although not designed to store carbon, these applications also constitute a stable carbon pool, thus contribute to carbon sequestration. However, large scale commercialization of the technology remain low, while the economics, and long-term behaviour of biominerals remain poorly understood.

JO  - Proceedings Of The Annual Offshore Technology Conference
PY  - 2018
VL  - 1
IS  - NA
AB  - During an initial Drillship flowback of a newly completed subsea GoM well, the produced fluids were found to contain unexpected and significant concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Despite no detectable levels of H2S in the native reservoir fluids produced from nearby wells in the same sand zone, the flowback separator gas-phase consistently showed H2S concentrations in excess of 100 ppm. It is believed that the souring was caused by irregularities during the completion phase, and the flowback was suspended indefinitely until the serious HS&E concerns could be addressed. Collaboration between the operator and the chemical partner resulted in appropriate operating procedures and chemical selection to allow the well to flowback through existing infrastructure. To mitigate the presence of sour fluids in the carbon steel subsea flowline and topsides plant, the chemical partner was able to prove through laboratory testing that a liquid-phase subsea H2S Scavenger application would prove highly effective. To deliver the chemistry, the scavenger was injected topsides (25 ppm scavenger to 1 ppm gas- phase H2S) into a continuous dead oil circulation that would be used mix with the sour fluids at the wellhead and provide a turbulent flow regime for mixing. This stage of the procedure was preceded by a 500-gallon oil-soluble corrosion inhibitor pill delivered between two pigs to protect the infield flowline from any acid gas induced corrosion. Once well flowback was re-initiated with the treated dead oil circulation, the chemistry was observed to be highly effective at scavenging H2S in the subsea flowline. Draeger tubes and inline gas meters showed no detectable levels of gas-phase H2S during continuous scavenger treatment. To confirm success of the chemical treatment, injection was temporarily ceased and H2S levels were once again detected and began to climb. The value delivered by the relatively small amount of scavenger chemical was tremendous, as the chemical partner was able to help the operator prevent multi-million dollars in workover expenses. Though not immediately quantifiable, the mitigation of topsides HS&E concerns was equally as valuable since the souring was neutralized prior to boarding.

AB  - Enhanced kinetics of carbon dioxide (CO2) hydrate formation will assist in developing technologies for CO2 gas storage, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), and potentially for methane production from natural gas hydrates. The present work is focused on understanding the kinetics of CO2 hydrate formation in both bulk and porous media with pure water and seawater under the influence of non-toxic and low-cost inorganic emulsifiers or builders. Sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) and tetrasodium pyrophosphate (TSPP) was used in a very low concentration of 0.2 wt.\% to promote its economic viability. The experiments were carried out in a 300 mL stirred tank reactor and 100 mL porous bed reactor with an initial pressure of 3.5 MPa and 274.65 K with pure water and seawater, respectively. The porous bed was made with 0.15 mm silica sand with 70\% water saturation. Both STPP and TSPP showed significant improvement in induction time for CO2 hydrate formation. Moreover, STPP showed reasonable enhancement in CO2 gas uptake compared to TSPP in both bulk and porous bed with both pure water and seawater. The average rate of hydrate formation was also better for STPP with multiple growth peaks. The results obtained will enhance hydrate-based technologies for efficient CO2 sequestration in shallow subsea sediments.

The tools developed in these institutes are thereby integrated. The workflow can be applied to proposed carbon storage sites. Starting with a qualitative analysis and scenario definition potential risky scenarios are defined. These are subsequently investigated in a quantitative way, either by so-called fast models or by fully developed numerical codes. The scenario analysis includes modelling of the reservoir and caprock behaviour, well integrity evaluation and migration path analysis. The important item of sensitivity analysis is addressed by probabilistic means. Finally, the consequences of potential surface leakage are addressed in this suite, resulting in a clear picture of the risks at a specific site / time. The presented methodology is tested on a real offshore gas field. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd Ltd.

AB  - The ``C-Plane{''} is a submerged variable depth ocean current turbine that is tethered to the sea floor and uses sustained ocean currents to produce electricity. As part of the development of a 1/30th scale physical model of the C-Plane, a mathematical model and dynamics simulation of the prototype was developed and is presented in this paper. This three-dimensional mathematical model represents the C-Plane as a rigid body with moveable control surfaces that is moored with three linear elastic cable elements. Gravitational, buoyancy, hydrodynamic, cable, gyroscopic, and inertial forces are included and a PC-based dynamics simulation is created. The simulation demonstrates that the C-Plane is stable and capable of changing depth in all expected operating conditions. The C-Plane prototype can fly level from a height of 3 to 6 m using the configuration suggested in this paper. The maximum ascent rates of the C-Plane with a Water speed of 0.3 m/s are 0.015 m/s when the pitch is fixed at 0 degrees and 0.030 m/s when the pitch is fixed at 4 degrees. The maximum descent rates of the C-Plane are 0.018 m/s when the pitch is held at 0 degrees and 0.031 m/s if the pitch is held at -4 degrees. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 5-A
IS  - NA
AB  - Stricter regulations and ambitious targets regarding air emissions from ships have led the shipping industry to a tipping point necessitating disruptive technologies for green and ecological operation. This study introduces a dual-fuel engine innovation with ultra-high energy conversion efficiency, thereby reducing exhaust gas emissions. However, the total cost performance of such an innovation throughout its long lifespan can be a matter of concern for decision makers (i.e. ship owners) if they decide to retrofit their existing fleet. The purpose of this study is to provide insights into the economic performance of such an innovative dual-fuel engine when it is utilized as the main propulsion system. From a cradle-to-grave perspective ranging from construction, operation, maintenance to end-of-life, the life-cycle costing (LCC) framework is proposed to evaluate the long-term cost performance of the dual-fuel engine with that of a conventional diesel engine. By using the net present cost (NPC) as an evaluation indicator, the research results reveal that the dual-fuel engine is considered as a cost-effective option except for the high fuel price differential scenario, meaning that fuel prices are the most critical factor for ship owners. In addition, the environmental impact of these engines is included in the evaluation to show that 33% reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) can be achieved when running the dual-fuel engine, compared to the diesel engine. The proposed framework could conceivably be beneficial in selecting marine engine innovation that takes not only the environmental impact but also the economic performance into consideration.

JO  - NANA

AB  - Over the past 4 years SBM has developed a revolutionary Wave Energy Converter (WEC): the S3. Floating under the ocean surface, the S3 amplifies pressure waves similarly to a Ruben's tube. Only made of elastomers, the system is entirely flexible, environmentally friendly and silent. Thanks to a multimodal resonant behavior, the S3 is capable of efficiently harvesting wave energy from a wide range of wave periods, naturally smoothing the irregularities of ocean wave amplitudes and periods. In the S3 system, Electro Active Polymer (EAP) generators are distributed along an elastomeric tube over several wave lengths, they convert wave induced deformations directly into electricity. The output is high voltage multiphase Direct Current with low ripple. Unlike other conventional WECs, the S3 requires no maintenance of moving parts. The design and operating principle will lead to a significant reduction of both CAPEX and OPEX. By integrating EAP generators into a small scale S3, SBM achieved a world first: direct conversion of wave energy in electricity with a moored flexible submerged EAP WEC in a wave tank test. Through an extensive testing program on large scale EAP generators, SBM identified the challenges in scaling up to a utility scale grid device. French Government supports the consortium consisting of SBM, IFREMER and ECN in their efforts to deploy a full scale prototype at the SEMREV test center in France at the horizon 2014-2015. SBM will be seeking strategic as well as financial partners to unleash the true potentials of the S3 Standing Wave Tube Electro Active Polymer WEC.

VL  - 1971-April
IS  - NA
AB  - Fish protein concentrates (FPC's) have been used in various parts of the world for several centuries. It has only been within the past 30 years, however, that the production of FPC has been investigated on a scientific basis. Today several pilot plants and fullscale industrial plants have been built. Some are now in operation and others will be within a matter of months. Most of these plants produce FPC by solvent (usually isopropyl alcohol) extraction nrocedures. The FPC's produced are, in general, bland tasting and vary in color from white to dark tan. They contain between 75 and 95 percent high-quality protein and they exhibit limited functional properties according to standards set by industry for high protein foodstuffs. The characteristic of limited functional properties, far from being a drawback, is in many circumstances advantageous since FPC can be added to existing food products to markedly improve the nutritional quality without significantly altering other characteristics. Also in some instances, the addition of FPC appears to improve the shelf life of final baked products. One must not assume, however, that all solvent extracted FPC's nor even all isopropyl alcohol extracted FPC's, are completely alike. On the contrary, significant differences in odor, lipid content, stability, taste, nutritional value, and functional properties are obtained depending upon the processing conditions and the species of fish used. Experimental work is now being conducted to produce FPC with various solvents, and with enzymes, microorganisms, or combinations of enzymes and, solvents. The functional properties of products resulting from these processes are improved. Some of these products appear to be particularly promising for use in certain foods because of their functional attributes. Although many problems still remain to be solved and additional research is reouired to show how FPC can be utilized more efficiently, an FPC industry has been born and is growing. Â© Copyright 1971.

AB  - Interest in blue carbon has drastically increased in recent years, particularly in improving the coastal resource carbon storage estimates and the development of methodology for identifying and monitoring such resources. In coastal resource mapping, participatory mapping techniques have the potential to provide a level of granularity and detail by taking advantage of local knowledge. In this work, we aim to evaluate the agreement between blue carbon ecosystem status obtained from participatory mapping versus the ones discriminated from satellite images, as well as assess how â€œrelative proximityâ€ to landmarks affects the accuracy. Results showed that the accuracy of mapped mangrove extents, evaluated as intersection-over-union, is positively correlated with frequency of visits. It is also found that maps generated by participants who have jobs or activities that nurture awareness about mangroves and seagrasses tend to agree better with remotely-sensed maps. The participants were even able to identify small patches of mangroves and seagrasses that are not present in the classified satellite images. While our initial work explores factors that impact the consistency between these sources, there is a need to establish a baseline for which both sources of information are evaluated against; and define relevant accuracy metrics. Our final goal is to systematically combine these two sources of information for an accurate holistic coastal resource map. Â© Authors 2019. CC BY 4.0 License.

JO  - Renewable \& Sustainable Energy Reviews
PY  - 2023

AB  - Brown algae adsorb a considerable amount of CO2 and store carbon in their biomass more than many other algae species. Nowadays, depletion of fossil fuel resources, greenhouse gas emissions, climate change, and the future of human food security have encouraged scientists and policymakers to develop safer and more sustainable al-ternatives of energy sources. Brown algae have attracted most of this attention in North American countries to generate a wide range of products and biomass for biorefinery. In this review paper, various aspects of brown algae cultivation and its biorefinery process are discussed. Main drivers of the sectors, opportunities, challenges, and future prospects of brown algae-based biofuels in North America have been taken into account; the most appropriate processes and pathways are compared to maximize the outputs and environmental benefits, and minimize costs and drawbacks of the industry. Analysis and predictions of renewable energy future in North American countries revealed that biomass-derived fuels, including brown algae biofuels, will play an important role especially in the transportation sector. These biofuels, including bioethanol and biodiesel are accompanied by various co-products and by-products in an optimized biorefinery system to convert every available component of brown algae. However, cultivation of brown algae to produce biomass at a commercial scale with minimum costs and market demands are the main challenges of algal biofuels. Finally, expanding the value chain of the brown algae biorefinery by producing more advanced biofuels such as aviation fuels and value-added co-and by-products would significantly impact North American countries' gross domestic product.

AB  - Stored carbon varies among wetlands, yet they rank among the highest carbon accumulating ecosystems. Leaf litter production and aboveground carbon storage are frequently used as proxies for estimating primary productivity, which can be affected by flooding, salinity and other environmental factors. The objective of this study was to quantify leaf litter production and soil carbon density in two coastal tropical wetland types, namely mangrove swamps and forested freshwater wetlands. Water and soil physicochemical properties, together with leaf litter production, were measured bimonthly between 2007 and 2009 in wetlands of both types, located on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The soils ranged from entirely mineral to entirely organic in the top metre. Mangrove sites had relatively uniform hydroperiods and moderately reductive soils, whereas forested freshwater wetlands had reducing conditions. Electrical conductivity was lower and pH less acidic in forested freshwater wetland soils. Litterfall was around 1000 g m(-2) yr(-1) and annual production did not differ significantly between wetlands, despite the presence of acidic soils with prolonged flooding and high salinity in the mangrove swamps. Also, there were no consistent differences in soil carbon density between the two wetland types. Some forested freshwater wetlands had low litter production and high soil carbon density, whereas some mangrove swamps had high litter production and low soil carbon density. We present information regarding aboveground biomass turnover and belowground carbon storage in coastal tropical forested wetlands which is greatly needed to support us in understanding, valuing and conserving these neglected ecosystems.

PY  - 2006
VL  - 2006

AB  - The presented study focuses on the development of offshore wind farms in conjunction with open ocean aquaculture within the German Bight. For aquaculture enterprises in the open ocean an extensive cultivation of various species, blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), oysters (Ostrea edulis, Crassostrea gigas) and seaweed (Laminaria saccharina), is considered. However, without the solid foundations for wind turbines, such as monopiles and tripods as anchor or connection points, economic installations of equipment for mariculture would not be possible in view of the high-energy environment in this part of the North Sea. Thus, one of the most important questions pertains whether it is technically possible and economic feasible to use the offshore foundation structures as fixation device for aquaculture operations, such as a longline as one possible culture design. A longline culture is an open-water suspended technology in which cultured species are on-grown on ropes or diverse sub-strates, such as rope collectors for the catch of mussel spat, suspended from anchored and buoyed surface or subsurface horizontal ropes (longline). For the calculation of additional foundation costs generated through the attached longline system knowledge on the supplement loads and stresses as well as on the required constructive modifications of the foundation must be obtained. The development and the conceptual design of offshore foundation structures are complex and require an interdisciplinary approach. In the presented project we aim to evaluate the induced loads between a foundation structure for offshore wind energy turbines and a longline system and to develop appropriate connection points. As monopile and tripod foundations are the most common foundation structures to date, these both will be considered within the modeling approach which calculates the respective loads from wind and waves. Both foundation structures are in the dimension of 4-5 MW wind turbines, while the monopile design will be calculated for a water depth of 10 m whereas the tripod for a water depth of 30 m. To validate the model outcomes, an entire monopile-longline-monopile construction is set up in the offshore waters 10 nautical miles off the Island of Sylt at a water depth of about 17 m. At this site, the deformation behavior of the entire system will be determined on the basis of analytically calculated loads supported by the measurement of local stresses at the junction of the longline with the foundation. An additional measurement of forces will be performed on selected mussel collectors. To evaluate the observed loads with respect to environmental conditions, namely currents and waves, accompanying sensors will be installed on site. These achieved datasets will be used for the verification of the computer model for mechanical loads at the longline. Finally it is intended to scale up the model to the proportions of a wind farm while considering the interactions in the wavefield in which the longline system will be located.

The application of LNG as fuel and battery packs to improve the conventional engines performance are already a reality in offshore supply vessels (OSV) around the world. However, the reduction in OPEX and payback time of the additional investment is very dependent of the ship operational profile, which are related to the FPSOs and port facilities particularities in Brazil. In order to estimate the advantages of these technologies in the PSV overall performance several different simulators regarding DP operation, sailing, waiting and anchored mode are combined to obtain a digital twin of the vessel. These simulators are combined to the real data monitored from the ships regarding ship speed, position and heading collected in Brazil based on AIS/AIS-Sat database. This database is combined to the environmental conditions regarding wave, current and wind obtained based on global numerical models to provide the environmental loads acting in the ship during the different stages of the operation. The DP simulations are performed applying a thrust allocation algorithm, the calm water resistance is obtained based on regression models and the added resistance due to waves are computed based on strip theory. The forces are converted into electric load by considering the propeller, generators, switchboard, electric drive and engine efficiency curves combined to a power management system (PMS) algorithm, which balance the loads in the engines according to the operational mode. The baseline for comparison is the current PSV without dual-fuel engines or battery pack. Â© 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

JO  - World Oil

VL  - 228
IS  - 4
AB  - A North Sea Basin Task Force, composed of governments and private and public organizations from the North Sea rim, was established with the aim of developing regulation and management of CO2 storage under the North Sea. Co2 injection potential is being extensively used for UKCS oil fields, for IOR and associated CO2 sequestration, prepared for the UK Department of Trade and Industry. One of the many challenges in the offshore implementation of CO2 injection into oil reservoirs for IOR is the management of Inevitable CO2 back production through producing wells. CO2 credit value is likely to rise in the longer term, while WAG injection costs may fall, if there is more implementation of CO2 injection. The UKCS also has substantial IOR and CO2 sequestration potential from CO2 injection into UKCS oil fields, which is expected to contribute substantially to its value.

TI  - Biological control of Aeromonas salmonicida infection in juvenile Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) with Phage AS-A
JO  - Aquaculture
PY  - 2016
VL  - 450
IS  - NA
AB  - One of the major sources of financial loss for the fish farming industry is the occurrence of infections by pathogenic bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant variants. This problem is most prominent during the early stages of fish development and is difficult to address with traditional antibiotic treatment or vaccination. In this way, alternative environmentally-friendly biological strategies to control bacterial infections need to be implemented. Under this scenario, phage therapy appears as a useful and flexible tool for the inactivation of bacterial pathogens in aquaculture. The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of phage therapy to inactivate Aeromonas salmonicida, the causative agent of furunculosis, a fish disease characterized by high mortality and morbidity. In order to achieve this goal, a new phage was isolated, characterized and tested in artificially-infected Solea senegalensis juveniles and in batch bacterial cultures. Results showed that after 6 h of treatment the phage inhibited the growth of A. salmonicida both in batch cultures and seawater in the presence of fish juveniles (approximate to 4 and 2.5 Log PFU mL(-1), respectively). After 72 h, fish juveniles treated with phages after exposure to A. salmonicida showed no mortality, contrarily to fishes that were only exposed to the bacterium, which presented a mortality of 36\%. This result indicated that phage treatment was effective. In general, a limited regrowth of resistant cells and absence of lysogeny conversion were observed. No significant impact of phage inoculation on natural bacterial communities of aquaculture waterwas detected. However, the bacterial community associated with fish intestinal tractwas moderately affected by the addition of the phage. Interestingly, the differences were not significant when the phage was added in the presence of the host bacteria. Taking this into account, this study provides evidences that the tested phage can be effective and safe against furunculosis during the production of juvenile fish. Statement of relevance A major source of financial loss for the fish-farming industry is the occurrence of bacterial infections. This problem is most prominent in early stages of fish development, and is difficult to address with antibiotics/vaccination. Alternative environmentally-friendly strategies to control bacterial infections are needed.

PY  - 2008

AB  - The tidal flow of sea water induced by planetary motion is a potential source of energy if suitable systems can be designed and operated in a cost-effective manner. This paper examines the physical origins of the tides and how the local currents are influenced by the depth of the seabed and presence of land mass and associated coastal features. The available methods of extracting energy from tidal movement are classified into devices that store and release potential energy and those that capture kinetic energy directly. A survey is made of candidate designs and, for the most promising, the likely efficiency of energy conversion and methods of installing them are considered. Overall, the need to reduce CO2 emissions, a likely continued rise in fossil fuel cost will result in a significantly increased use of tidal energy. What is still required, especially for kinetic energy devices, is a much greater understanding of how they can be designed to withstand long-term immersion in the marine environment.

JO  - Biomass Conversion And Biorefinery
PY  - 2022
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Sorption-enhanced gasification has been shown as a viable low-carbon alternative to conventional gasification, as it enables simultaneous gasification with in-situ CO2 capture to enhance the production of H2. CaO-based sorbents have been a preferred choice due to their low cost and wide availability. This work assessed the technical and economic viability of sorption-enhanced gasification using natural limestone, doped limestone with seawater and dolomite. The techno-economic performance of the sorption-enhanced gasification using different sorbents was compared with that of conventional gasification. Regarding the thermodynamic performance, dolomite presented the worst performance (46.0% of H2 production efficiency), whereas doped limestone presented the highest H2 production efficiency (50.0%). The use of dolomite also resulted in the highest levelised cost of hydrogen (5.4 â‚¬/kg against 5.0 â‚¬/kg when limestone is used as sorbent), which translates into a CO2 avoided cost ranging between 114.9 â‚¬/tCO2 (natural limestone) and 130.4 â‚¬/tCO2 (dolomite). Although doped limestone has shown a CO2 avoided cost of 117.7 â‚¬/tCO2, this can be reduced if the production cost of doped limestone is lower than 42.6 â‚¬/t. The production costs of new sorbents for CO2 capture and H2 production need to be similar to that of natural limestone to become an attractive alternative to natural limestone.

PY  - 2014
VL  - 28
IS  - NA
AB  - This paper examines the costs and benefits of reduction measures for the shipping industry to comply with the forthcoming sulphur emission regulations. Sulphur scrubbers and marine gas oil are two promising alternatives for ship owners. However, their economic comparisons are primarily based on a private perspective. This paper provides a wider viewpoint by integrating the private abatement costs of ship owners and the social environmental benefits from emission reduction. The results showed that the price spread between marine gas oil and heavy fuel oil is a determining factor in making this choice. Marine gas oil tends to have higher net present values than scrubbers when the price spread of fuel is less than 231. Euros per tonne. Furthermore, it is more beneficial to install a scrubber on new ships than retrofits. An old ship is not suitable for a scrubber installation when its remaining lifespan is less than 4. years.

TI  - Experimental study on methane hydrate formation in quartz sand under tri-axial condition
JO  - Journal Of Natural Gas Science And Engineering
PY  - 2021
VL  - 85
IS  - NA
AB  - Methane hydrate (MH) has been considered as one of the cleanest energy resources. Its huge resource reserve and high energy density have attracted widespread attention in the scientific field. The dynamic behavior of MH formation and the resulting hydrate saturation are greatly influenced by the conditions of the formation process, such as water-gas ratio (WGR), pressure (P), temperature (T), and the mass fraction of NaCl (X-NaCl). To gain a better understanding of the kinetic behavior of the in-situ MH deposits, a novel trTaxial horizon fixed bed reactor was set up to synthesize MH samples under typical marine conditions. A series of MH formation experiments were conducted under similar initial stress conditions (initial trTaxial stress of 16.50 MPa to simulate the overburden stress of marine MH) while perturbing the other key factors (WGR, P, T, and X-NaCl) to investigate their effects. The results show that MH saturation attained at the end of formation from an initial water-gas mixing condition was negatively affected by initial WGR, T, and the existence of NaCl. MH formation in the fixed bed reactor increases initial X-NaCl = 3.0 wt\% to a maximum of X-NaCl = 5.29 wt\% and shifts the MH equilibrium curve to a more stringent condition for MH formation. Higher pressure promotes CH4 conversion to MH and increases MH saturation from the start of gas injection to the time when the pressure of the reactor was stable (Delta P < 20 kPa/h). Larger initial WGRs (above MH hydration number = 5.75) and higher pressures result in a reduction of the induction time. Increasing temperature and the presence of NaCl increase the induction time.

IS  - NA
AB  - Due to current and upcoming regulations to address the adverse impacts of particulate matter (PM) from shipping emissions, the maritime sector is required to find energy-efficient ways to comply mainly by using low fuel sulfur content (FSC) in regulated seas. We studied the PM emission from a research ship diesel engine with fuel switching capability, optimized for HFO used at cruising, operated at representative engine loads resulting to varying excess O-2 emission which was an indirect measurement of air-fuel mixture (lambda), using heavy fuel oil (HFO, 1.6 S (\%m)) and diesel fuel (DF, <0.001 S (\%m)). We determined the characteristics and temporal evolution of the PM by using the High Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometry (HR-ToF-AMS) in combination with aethalometer, particle sizers, online gas phase, and filter measurements. The average emission factors were higher for HFO than for DF with relative percent differences of similar to 200, similar to 180, similar to 150, and similar to 145 for SO42-, inorganic elements, organic matter (OM), and PM2.5, respectively, while that for black carbon (BC) was similar for both fuels. The difference between HFO and DF in terms of carbonaceous emissions was higher at 100\% and 25\% than at 75\% and 50\% engine loads. The exhaust temperature (1) decreased with increasing lambda leading to the enhanced emission of OM in HFO and reduced OM and BC emission in DF. Contributions of hydrocarbons and,oxygenated hydrocarbons increased with lambda for HFO and decreased with DF. Gas phase total hydrocarbon (THC) was well correlated with BC only for HFO and OM and BC for DF. Overall, using a lower FSC reduced average PM emissions, however, engine load, and lambda were strongly linked to the characteristics and temporal evolution of major PM emissions. The information in this study may help the marine sector and policy-making process in evaluating and designing future solutions for shipping emission regulations and diagnostics.

AB  - Traditionally seagoing vessels have been designed and optimized to operate at maximum economic speeds based on hydrodynamic considerations. More recently, high fuel prices and increased environmental concerns have challenged this practice. In combination with the introduction of stricter energy efficiency requirements, this makes design improvement a necessity for all new bulk vessels. This is in contradiction to traditional bulk vessel designs, where the focus has been on maximizing the cargo-carrying capacity at the lowest possible building cost, and not on reducing the energy consumption. Moreover, historically the Panama Canal has been an important design criterion, while the new canal locks from 2014 will significantly increase the maximum size of vessels that can sail through the canal. This expansion will enable cost cmd emission reductions through employing larger vessels or by more cost and energy efficient designs being introduced. The present paper provides an assessment of what can be achieved by employing larger bulk vessels and by introducing more energy efficient designs with focus on a vessel's beam, length and hull slenderness expressed by the length displacement ratio.

AB  - In a joint effort to address global climate change, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has considered imposing a regulatory regime on the operational energy effciency of ships to complement the existing mandatory mechanism on design effciency. However, the random and uncertain nature of the operational energy effciency of ships poses a signifcant challenge to performance regulation. In this paper, a quantile regression model, with dummy variables representing the observation calendar years, is applied to quantify the level, the scale and the skewness of the distribution of the operational carbon intensity performance of international shipping. A rating mechanism is further constructed on this basis, which is able to guide the performance of international shipping as a whole in line with the levels of ambition, whilst being robust to certain individual deviations. This rating mechanism is demonstrated using the bulk feet of China as a sample, which shows its competency as a systematic solution for scientifc evaluation of the operational energy effciency of ships.

AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping are an increasing concern. The paper evaluates whether vessel speed reduction can be a potentially cost-effective CO(2) Mitigation option for ships calling on US ports. By applying a profit-maximizing equation to estimate route-specific, economically-efficient speeds, we explore policy impacts of a fuel tax and a speed reduction mandate on CO(2) emissions. The profit-maximizing function incorporates opportunity costs associated with speed reduction that go unobserved in more traditional marginal abatement cost analyses. We find that a fuel tax of about \$150/ton fuel will lead to average speed-related CO(2) reductions of about 20-30\%. Moreover, a speed reduction mandate targeted to achieve 20\% CO(2) reduction in the container fleet costs between \$30 and \$200 per ton CO(2) abated, depending on how the fleet responds to a speed reduction mandate.

AB  - This paper describes the hydrodynamic, pneumatic, and electrical modeling and simulation study performed in the development of the Healy Wave Energy Converter (HWEC). The HWEC, based on a two-body structure, consists of a flotation buoy rigidly connected to a long vertical inertial tube which is open at the top and bottom. A piston-rod assembly is enclosed and connected to the power take-off (PTO) mechanism. Due to inertia of water within the tube, relative motion between the piston and the buoy-inertia tube structure drives the PTO, which consists of an air compressor, a dynamic pressure regulator and a turbine connected to an induction generator supported by a power electronic conversion system. The induction generator is operated in both self-excitation mode using switched capacitors and external excitation mode using an inverter to generate flexible power forms and to maximize the energy yield over a wide range of wave conditions. A PLC based control system ensures balance between the generated and consumed power under all dynamic conditions. Nonlinear time-domain numerical models were developed for each subsystem. The resulting modeling framework was used to specify component requirements, select operational parameters, and evaluate system performance. The HWEC system is designed to output moderate power with high reliability. The present analysis demonstrates that the HWEC can produce and store energy over a wide range of sea states, making it highly suitable for off-grid and micro-grid applications.

JO  - Nature Communications
PY  - 2020
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
AB  - The biological pump transports organic carbon produced by photosynthesis to the meso- and bathypelagic zones, the latter removing carbon from exchanging with the atmosphere over centennial time scales. Organisms living in both zones are supported by a passive flux of particles, and carbon transported to the deep-sea through vertical zooplankton migrations. Here we report globally-coherent positive relationships between zooplankton biomass in the epi-, meso-, and bathypelagic layers and average net primary production (NPP). We do so based on a global assessment of available deep-sea zooplankton biomass data and large-scale estimates of average NPP. The relationships obtained imply that increased NPP leads to enhanced transference of organic carbon to the deep ocean. Estimated remineralization from respiration rates by deep-sea zooplankton requires a minimum supply of 0.44 Pg C yâˆ’1 transported into the bathypelagic ocean, comparable to the passive carbon sequestration. We suggest that the global coupling between NPP and bathypelagic zooplankton biomass must be also supported by an active transport mechanism associated to vertical zooplankton migration.

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - The State of Wyoming, USA, benefits from favorable geologic, regulatory, and infrastructure attributes that promote efficient and sustainable carbon capture and storage (CCS). Two research sites in Wyoming exhibit high potential for the underground geologic storage of greater than 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) over 25 years. Funded by the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s (DOE) Carbon Storage Assurance and Facility Enterprise (DOE CarbonSAFE) Phase I prefeasibility initiative, studies of both sites indicate promising capture, transport, utilization, and storage characteristics. The Dry Fork site is located near Gillette, in northeast Wyoming. Four storage reservoir/seal pairs have been identified at the Dry Fork site that provide excellent prospects for stacked storage of CO2. All four reservoirs lie at sufficient depths to maintain supercritical CO2 and all four seals exhibit favorable characteristics for stratigraphic confinement. The reservoir with the highest expected significance is the Pennsylvanian/Permian Minnelusa Formation, which consists of near-shore dunes and shoreline sands, as well as shale and carbonate layers. The Minnelusa resides at a depth of ~2,900 m below the land surface and is ~45 m thick in the study area. Average porosity for samples from core within 10 km of the study area is 9%, with permeability values as high as 169 mD (n=6). The Permian Opeche Formation seals the Minnelusa and consists of redbed shales with minor fine-grained siltstones and evaporite deposits. Entry pressures as high as ~4700 psia were measured by mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) analysis on core samples from the Opeche. A CarbonSAFE Phase II feasibility proposal at the Dry Fork site has recently been selected for award by the DOE. The second proposed site is located at the Rock Springs Uplift (RSU) in southwest Wyoming. Four reservoir/seal pairs have been studied at the RSU, all of which present promising geologic attributes for the stacked storage of CO2. The two deepest reservoirs (Mississippian Madison Limestone and Pennsylvanian/Permian Weber Formation) and their seals were studied previously under the auspices of the Wyoming Carbon Underground Storage Project (WY-CUSP), which was funded by DOE and the State of Wyoming. For the more recent CarbonSAFE initiative, two shallower reservoir/seal pairs were studied in detail. The highest priority of these reservoirs is the Triassic/Jurassic Nugget Formation, which consists of eolian sands and minor fluvial and interdune deposits. The Nugget lies at a depth of ~2,800 m and is ~140 m thick in the study area. Average measured porosity for samples from core within 40 km of the study site is 9%, with permeability values as high as 91 mD (n=10). The Nugget is sealed by the overlying Jurassic Gypsum Spring and Morrison Formations, as well as a thick (~1,700 m) regional Upper Cretaceous seal that includes shales from multiple geologic units. Entry pressures as high as 1120 psia were measured by MICP for shales within this regional confining unit. Overall, the State of Wyoming provides an advantageous climate to develop sustainable integrated CCS projects based on the following considerations: (1) well-characterized and favorable geology; (2) some of the largest deposits of economically recoverable coal in the USA; (3) an existing CO2-enhanced oil recovery industry, including CO2 pipeline infrastructure; (4) supportive commercial enterprises, including utilities and the oil and gas industry; (5) supportive policymakers; (6) a favorable legal and regulatory environment; (7) proximity to carbon-constrained markets such as the State of California; (8) large CO2 emission sources, including coal-fired power plants; and (9) backing for carbon capture, storage, and management related research and development, specifically implementation of the Integrated Test Center at Dry Fork Station, which is hosting the coal-track of the NRG/COSIA Carbon XPrizeÃ’ competition.

PY  - 2018
VL  - 74
IS  - NA
AB  - This study is part of a multi-phase effort to identify and characterize offshore geological carbon storage (GCS) potential along the Texas Gulf Coast. Previous efforts acquired a high-resolution 3D seismic dataset (P-cableâ„¢) and interpreted a seismically discontinuous zone as shallow gas pockets (&lt;100 m below seafloor) associated with a vertical chimney structure. Our approach was to measure hydrocarbon concentrations and stable carbon isotopes near the seafloor to assess if gas migrated vertically from seismic anomalies. Deep-sourced thermogenic hydrocarbons would indicate that the structure is transmissive which could indicate an unacceptable risk for GCS at the site. Alternatively, hydrocarbons formed in-situ from biogenic processes would not preclude transmissivity of the structure but would add information to the risk assessment. Gases were extracted from 23 piston core samples recovered between 2.56 and 3.50 m subseafloor. Light hydrocarbons and stable carbon isotopes of methane were used for source attribution. The result was that geochemical signatures were consistent with typical background values observed within the first few meters of subsea sediment and therefore did not indicate leakage from depth. From our analysis, we offer insights into the use of hydrocarbon molecular and isotopic compositions at the seafloor for signal attribution as part of environmental assessments at geological CO2 storage sites.

AB  - At the recent UN climate change convention in Kyoto, the EU countries agreed to a further reduction in their CO2 emissions of 8% by 2010. Although the new Sizewell B generator and improvements to other British nuclear plant have helped to ensure that earlier targets have been met, the lack of any planned replacement nuclear generation means that to achieve this new target Britain will need to focus on improving energy efficiency, reducing energy consumption and developing other renewable energy sources as the older stations reach the end of their economic lives. This paper reviews the UK's challenges in a global context and proposes a basis for a national sustainable energy policy with regard to electricity generation. In particular, it calls for the government to encourage development of further nuclear and tidal power stations, including the proposed Severn barrage.

TI  - Methane Production from Gas Hydrate Deposits through Injection of Supercritical CO2

IS  - 7
AB  - The recovery of natural gas from CH4-hydrate deposits in sub-marine and sub-permafrost environments through injection of CO2 is considered a suitable strategy towards emission-neutral energy production. This study shows that the injection of hot, supercritical CO2 is particularly promising. The addition of heat triggers the dissociation of CH4-hydrate while the CO2, once thermally equilibrated, reacts with the pore water and is retained in the reservoir as immobile CO2-hydrate. Furthermore, optimal reservoir conditions of pressure and temperature are constrained. Experiments were conducted in a high-pressure flow-through reactor at different sediment temperatures (2 degrees C, 8 degrees C, 10 degrees C) and hydrostatic pressures (8 MPa, 13 MPa). The efficiency of both, CH4 production and CO2 retention is best at 8 degrees C, 13 MPa. Here, both CO2- and CH4-hydrate as well as mixed hydrates can form. At 2 degrees C, the production process was less effective due to congestion of transport pathways through the sediment by rapidly forming CO2-hydrate. In contrast, at 10 degrees C CH4 production suffered from local increases in permeability and fast breakthrough of the injection fluid, thereby confining the accessibility to the CH4 pool to only the most prominent fluid channels. Mass and volume balancing of the collected gas and fluid stream identified gas mobilization as equally important process parameter in addition to the rates of methane hydrate dissociation and hydrate conversion. Thus, the combination of heat supply and CO2 injection in one supercritical phase helps to overcome the mass transfer limitations usually observed in experiments with cold liquid or gaseous CO2.

TI  - CO2 fluxes across the air-sea interface in the southeastern Beaufort Sea: Ice-free period
JO  - Journal Of Geophysical Research: Oceans
PY  - 2010
VL  - 115
IS  - 4
AB  - Surface mixed layer CO2 fugacities (fCO2-sw) calculated from carbonate system parameters in the southeastern Beaufort Sea during the ice-free period ranged from 240 to 350 Î¼atm in fall 2003 and from 175 to 515 Î¼atm in summer 2004. The surface mixed layer remains mostly undersaturated with respect to atmospheric CO2 (378 Î¼atm) and, therefore, acts as a potential CO2 sink throughout this period. Air-sea CO2 fluxes (FCO2) were first computed assuming ice-free conditions and ranged from -32.4 to +8.6 mmol m-2 d -1 in fall 2003 and summer 2004, respectively. Then we included a reduction factor to account for ice cover (ic) and we computed the resulting fluxes (FCO2-ic). In fall 2003, FCO2-ic ranged from -4.7 mmol m-2 d-1 in the relatively open water of the Cape Bathurst Polynya to -0.1 mmol m-2 d-1 in the southeastern Beaufort Sea, limited by the presence of the multiyear sea ice. In summer 2004, FCO2-ic ranged from -13.1 mmol m-2 d-1 on the western Mackenzie Shelf to +8.6 mmol m-2 d-1 at Cape Bathurst; the variability being ascribed to competing effects of vertical mixing, temperature variations, and possibly biological production. On average, a net sink of -2.3 Â± 3.5 mmol m-2 d-1 was estimated for the ice-free period over the study area. Nevertheless, the FCO2 displays strong variability due to ice coverage, freshwater input, and upwelling events. The potential responses (direction and intensity of potential feedbacks) of the carbon cycle in the study area to a changing Arctic climate are discussed. Â© 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.

JO  - Global Change Biology
PY  - 2018
VL  - 24
IS  - 9
AB  - Accumulation of anthropogenic CO2 is significantly altering ocean chemistry. A range of biological impacts resulting from this oceanic CO2 accumulation are emerging, however, the mechanisms responsible for observed differential susceptibility between organisms and across environmental settings remain obscure. A primary consequence of increased oceanic CO2 uptake is a decrease in the carbonate system buffer capacity, which characterizes the system's chemical resilience to changes in CO2, generating the potential for enhanced variability in pCO(2) and the concentration of carbonate {[}CO32], bicarbonate [}HCO3], and protons {[}H+] in the future ocean. We conducted a meta-analysis of 17 shipboard manipulation experiments performed across three distinct geographical regions that encompassed a wide range of environmental conditions from European temperate seas to Arctic and Southern oceans. These data demonstrated a correlation between the magnitude of natural phytoplankton community biological responses to short-term CO2 changes and variability in the local buffer capacity across ocean basin scales. Specifically, short-term suppression of small phytoplankton (<10m) net growth rates were consistently observed under enhanced pCO(2) within experiments performed in regions with higher ambient buffer capacity. The results further highlight the relevance of phytoplankton cell size for the impacts of enhanced pCO(2) in both the modern and future ocean. Specifically, cell size-related acclimation and adaptation to regional environmental variability, as characterized by buffer capacity, likely influences interactions between primary producers and carbonate chemistry over a range of spatio-temporal scales.

AB  - To limit global warming, governments and industries are engaged in reducing emissions of CO2. There is increasing evidence, however, that it may be necessary to go a step further by removing CO2 already emitted. For the purpose of carbon dioxide removal (CDR), a number of negative emissions technologies (NET) have been proposed. These generally make extensive usage of land, energy and water - if they are to be implemented at the large scales needed. It is therefore important to seek, investigate and compare alternative approaches to NET. Desalination plants, though normally seen as sources rather than sinks of CO2, could be modified to provide a new type of NET. In this study, we propose treating desalination reject brine by electrolysis to form Mg(OH)(2) and thus absorb CO2 via the oceans. The energy and water penalties associated with the electrolysis are calculated as 1.8 GJ per tCO(2) and 13.7 m(3) per tCO(2) respectively, making it an interesting option in comparison with some other types of NET. However, NET-modification more than doubles the specific energy consumption of a reverse-osmosis desalination plant. It is concluded that NET-desalination has potential to contribute to CDR in arid countries (especially if solar energy is used) thus helping to meet Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) following the COP21 summit.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 113
IS  - NA
AB  - Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) is a promising technology to provide sustainable and dispatchable energy supply to oceanic coastal areas and islands. It exploits the temperature difference between deep cold ocean water and warm tropical surface water in an Organic RankineCycle (ORC), guaranteeing a continuous and dispatchable electric production, overcoming one ofthe most critical issue of renewable generators such as PV or wind turbines. Despite the technological maturity of ORC application to OTEC systems, it still presents technical and economicbarriers mainly related to their economic feasibility, large initial investments as well as heavy and time demanding civil installation works. To overcome such issues, multipurpose OTEC plants are proposed, producing electrical power as well as other products, such as useful thermal power (e.g. ambient cooling) and desalinated water. Since OTEC engineering is still at a lowdegree of maturity, there are no widespread and established tools to facilitate OTEC feasibility studies and to allow performance and cost optimization. Therefore, in this paper, a new tool for techno-economic analysis and optimization of multipurpose OTEC plants is presented. Starting from a detailed database of local water temperature and depth, the approach allows to provide a quantitative insight on the achievable performance, required investment, and expected economic returns, allowing for a preliminary but robust assessment of site potential as well as plant size. After the description of the techno-economic approach and related performance and cost functions, the tool is applied to an OTEC power plant case study in the range of 1 MW gross electrical power, including a preliminary assessment of scaling-up effects.

TI  - Modeling of the efficiency of a semisubmerged ocean wave energy converter
JO  - Marine Technology Society Journal
PY  - 2013
VL  - 47
IS  - 4
AB  - The RTI G2 is a terminator-type wave energy converter (WEC) that converts energy through a power take-off (PTO) system located within an elongated, wave-front facing compressible air chamber. The compression and expansion of the chamber is driven by both kinetic and potential energy due to the surge and heave wave forces acting on an actuator plate oriented parallel to oncomingwaves. The RTI G2 converter is mounted on a stabilizing frame, whichmay float or be fixed to the seabed and allows the air chamber to be totally submerged below wave troughs during severe seas. The present work examines the performance of the RTI G2 on a fixed frame. Model tests conducted on a 1:8 scale are reviewed, and a mathematical model to describe the performance of the RTI G2 is developed. The experimental results are used for calibration and validation of the mathematical model. Several orientation angles of the compression chamber aremodeled, with higher orientation angles yielding better efficiencies at higher wave frequencies. The RTI G2 is a novel WEC concept, and the present work provides the first analytical investigation into its behavior.

AB  - To enhance the power coefficient of vertical-axis tidal current turbine, a mathematic optimization model for the blades' deflection angle was presented. In this model, the function of blade deflection angle versus azimuth in one period of motion was expressed as a linear sum of a series of Hicks-Henne functions. And take the functional relation into computational process of hydrodynamic performance of rotor. To optimize deflection angle, the coefficients of those Hicks-Henne functions were taken as design variables, and the power coefficient as objective function. Revolving orientation method was applied as approach to achieve the optimization. Double-multiple streamtube method was adopted to calculate the hydrodynamic performance of turbine. At last, the cycloidal turbine was optimized for verification. Example results indicate that the power coefficient of optimized turbine is evidently higher than that of cycloidal turbine, and the optimized turbine is easier to start.

PY  - 2012
VL  - 134
IS  - 2
AB  - This paper analyzes temperature measurements acquired in the offshore operation of a wave energy converter array. The three directly driven wave energy converters have linear generators and are connected to a marine substation placed on the seabed. The highly irregular individual linear generator voltages are rectified and added on a common dc-link and inverted to 50 Hz to facilitate future grid-connection. The electrical power is transmitted to shore and converted to heat in a measuring station. The first results of temperature measurements on substation components and on the stator of one of the linear generators are presented based on operation in linear and in nonlinear damping. The results indicate that there might be some convective heat transfer in the substation vessel. If high power levels are extracted from the waves, this has to be considered when placing components in the substation vessel in order to avoid heating from neighboring components. The results also indicate that the temperature increase in the linear generator stator is very small. Failure due to excessive heating of the stator winding polyvinyl chloride cable insulation is unlikely to occur even in very energetic sea states. Should this conclusion be incorrect, the thermal conductivity between the stator and the hull of the wave energy converter could be enhanced. Another suggested alteration is to lower the resistive losses by reducing the linear generator current density. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4004629]

TI  - Is It Possible to Achieve IMO Carbon Emission Reduction Targets at the Current Pace of Technological Progress?

AB  - Purpose - The primary purpose of this study is to verify whether the target set out by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for reducing carbon emissions from ships can be achieved by quantitatively analyzing the trends in technological advances of fuel oil consumption in the container shipping market. To achieve this purpose, several scenarios are designed considering various options such as eco-friendly fuels, low-speed operation, and the growth in ship size. Design/methodology - The vessel size and speed used in prior studies are utilized to estimate the fuel oil consumption of container ships and the pace of technological progress and Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) regulations are added. A database of 5,260 container ships, as of 2019, is used for multiple linear regression and quantile regression analyses. Findings - The fuel oil consumption of vessels is predominantly affected by their speed, followed by their size, and the annual technological progress is estimated to be 0.57\%. As the quantile increases, the influence of ship size and pace of technological progress increases, while the influence of speed and coefficient of EEDI variables decreases. Originality/value - The conservative estimation of carbon emission drawn by a quantitative analysis of the technological progress concerning the fuel efficiency of container vessels shows that it is not possible to achieve IMO targets. Therefore, innovative efforts beyond the current scope of technological progress are required.

TI  - Quantification of blue carbon stocks associated with Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadows in Corsica (NW Mediterranean)
JO  - Science Of The Total Environment
PY  - 2022
VL  - 838
IS  - 1
AB  - In the last decades, the increasing necessity to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations has intensified interest in quantifying the capacity of coastal ecosystems to sequester carbon, referred to commonly as `Blue Carbon' (BC). Among coastal habitats, seagrass meadows are considered as natural carbon sinks due to their capacity to store large amounts of carbon in their sediments over long periods of time. However, the spatial heterogeneity of carbon stocks in seagrass sediments needs to be better understood to improve the accuracy of BC assessments, particularly where there is high environmental variability. In the Mediterranean, Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile constitutes extensive meadows considered as long-term carbon sinks due to the development of an exceptional structure known as `matte', reaching several meters in height, which can be preserved over millennia. In order to specify the role of P. oceanica meadows in climate change mitigation, an estimate of carbon stocks has been conducted along the eastern coast of Corsica (NW Mediterranean). The approach is mainly based on the biogeochemical analysis of 39 sediment cores. Organic carbon (C-org; 327 +/- 150 t ha(-1), mean +/- SE) and inorganic carbon stocks (C-inorg; 245 +/- 45 t ha-1) show a high variability related to water depth, matrix (sandy vs rocky substrate) or the depositional environment (coastal vs estuary). The isotopic signature (delta C-13) revealed a substantial contribution of allochthonous inputs of organic matter (macroalgae and sestonic sources) mainly in estuarine environment and shallow areas. The carbon stocks in the first 250 cm of matte (average thickness) were estimated at 5.6-14.0 million t C-org (study site) and 14.6-36.9 million t C-org (Corsica), corresponding to 11.6-29.2 and 30.4-76.8 years of CO2 emissions from the population of Corsica.

JO  - Wetland Science
PY  - 2012
VL  - 10
IS  - 2
AB  - Wetlands are an important ecosystem for carbon storage, contributing 20% of continental carbon storages within 4%-5% of the continental areas. Carbon cycling has become an important ecosystem service set against a background of climate change. China has a coastline of 18 000 km along which there is an estimated 12 000 km 2 of tidal estuarine wetlands. These tidal wetlands are generally rich in animal and plant biodiversity and appear to have an important biogeochemical role within the estuary ecosystem. Estuarine wetlands occur along salinity gradient as a result of tidal inundation and this influences carbon storages by regulating the inputs and outputs of dissolved carbon and the accumulation and erosion of carbon. Research in this area is conflicting. The Min River estuarine wetlands are an important tidal wetland ecosystem in south-east China, as it is located at the boundary between mid- and southern subtropical climate zones. This estuarine wetland is close to Fuzhou city where rapid economic development, building construction and expansion of the city scale has intensified the use of the wetland and over-exploitation of the wetland resources has occurred. As a result, the area of natural wetland is decreasing and the ecosystem services are reducing as its ecological functions are impaired. The Minjiang River estuary is a typical tidal estuary in the south-east of China; Phragmites australis is the dominant species and distributed from upper to lower reaches. Soil depth profiles (0-60 cm cores) were collected from three Phragmites australis communities spread across three wetlands distributed along a salinity gradient; these cores were divided in 10 cm layers and various soil properties were measured including soil organic carbon concentrations. Soil pH, bulk density, sand composition all decreased with soil salinity increased, but, soil clay and silt composition increased. Soil organic carbon concentrations (0-60 cm depths) ranged between 11.6-14.7 g/kg, 14.1-19.2 g/kg and 20.9-2.9 g/kg, respectively in the Phragmite australis marshes in the Youxizhou, Bianfuzhou and Shanyutan wetlands as salinity increased. The amount of carbon stores in each layer in the 3 communities also increased with salinity from 1 408-1 670 t/km 2, 1 328-1 660 t/km 2and 1 320-1 678 t/km 2, respectively with mean site values of 1 534 t/km 2, 1 548 t/km 2 and 1 569 t/km 2, respectively. The total soil (0-60 cm) carbon storages were 9 204.79 t/km 2, 9 288.71 t/km 2 and 9 415.35 t/km 2, respectively. Soil organic carbon concentration and storage increased as soil salinity increased. Soil organic carbon concentration was influenced by many factors.

AB  - Solar energy, wind energy, ocean energy and geothermal energy are the reproducible energy source. The renewable energy, which is used to generate electricity, not only is clean and pollution-free, but also has a large reserve. Therefore, it becomes an important energy in the world. Multi-energy hybrid power supply system based on solar energy, wind energy, ocean energy and geothermal energy is a tendency. But in most cases, a multi-energy hybrid power supply system is bothered by the uncertainty of wind resources and non-continuity of solar power without high-powered control strategy. To provide a sustained, stable and continuous power to customers, a structure of multi-energy hybrid power supply system is established and a neural network model is developed in this paper. A control strategy for multi-energy hybrid power supply systems is proposed by analyzing the characteristics of solar energy, wind energy, ocean energy and geothermal energy. In order to accelerate the convergence and to prevent oscillation, Levenberg-Marquaret algorithm is used and the momentum factor Î± is introduced in the training. Simulation shows that this strategy can make the voltage sustained, stable and continuous in the maximum use of renewable energy, which can be satisfied to customers' electricity need. Â© 2010 IEEE.

TI  - Bunker levy schemes for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction in international shipping
JO  - Transportation Research Part D: Transport And Environment
PY  - 2017
VL  - 57
IS  - NA
AB  - A fuel levy is one of the market-based measures (MBMs) currently under consideration at the International Maritime Organization. MBMs have been proposed to improve the energy efficiency of the shipping sector and reduce its emissions. This paper analyses the economic and environmental implications of two types of levy on shipping bunker fuels by means of an analytical model built on the cobweb theorem. A unit-tax per ton of fuel and an ad-valorem tax, enforced as a percentage of fuel prices, are examined. In both cases, a speed and fuel-consumption reduction equivalent to an improvement in the energy efficiency of the sector would be expected as a result of the regulation enforcement. The speed reduction in the unit-tax case depends on fuel prices and the tax amount, whereas in the ad-valorem case it relies upon the enforced tax percentage. Both schemes lead to industry profit decline, the extent of which depend on the structure of the levy and market conditions. Since there is concern that the costs resulting from the policy will be passed from shipping companies to their customers along the supply chain, the paper dwells on how the costs arising from the enforcement of the levy will be actually allocated between ship-owners and operators, and cargo-owners. In a market characterised by high freight rates and with no or limited excess capacity, a higher percentage of the total tax amount is transferred from ship-owners to shippers. In case of a recession the opposite happens. Â© 2017 The Authors

AB  - Hydrogen may offer considerable potential as a marine fuel. The lower fuel mass when compared with existing hydrocarbon fuels can usefully increase payload which in turn benefits the economics of oceanic transport and provides the opportunity to compete in new markets. The potential to virtually eliminate pollution at the point of use may prove significant at a time when exhaust emissions from shipping are becoming a matter of global concern. The potential for hydrogen in the marine environment, the current state of transferable technologies, the particular technical and economic issues that need to be addressed are considered in the context of a design study being conducted on a high speed foil-assisted catamaran capable of transporting 600 industry standard containers at speeds of up to 64 knots (118.5 km/hr) over trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic trade routes. It is concluded that such a vessel is technically feasible and could achieve door-to-door delivery times as part of an integrated transport chain otherwise only possible by airfreight but at a fraction of the cost.

AB  - Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) {[}1] was introduced by the International Maritime organization (IMO) to stimulate innovation and technical development of all elements that increase the level of energy efficiency of a ship at design stage. Sea going ships over 400 gross tonnage are considered in the current regulation of EEDI. Inland ships are not covered by current EEDI regulations by IMO. As inland vessels share 0.6\% of the global CO2 emission {[}2], the reduction attempt will not have bigger impact. But from the commercial point of view of a country the significance is very high, specially for under developed countries like Bangladesh. Inland self propelled ships face additional restrictions (shallow water/channel, low density water, restriction of ship's dimension, etc.) which increase the power requirement at the same speed, burning more fuel and emit more CO2. This paper is a continuation of the Ph.D research of the author where previous published paper's [}3] results were updated and verified. The result of this paper would be one of the 1st attempts in the world was made to establish EEDI baseline for different types of self-propelled inland ships. (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Developing a profiling glider pH sensor for high resolution coastal ocean acidification monitoring
JO  - NANA

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Coastal and ocean acidification can alter ocean biogeochemistry, with ecological consequences that may result in economic and cultural losses. Yet few time series and high-resolution measurements exist to track the existence and movement of water low in pH and/or carbonate saturation. Past acidification monitoring efforts have either low spatial resolution (mooring) or high cost and low temporal and spatial resolution (research cruises). Therefore, there is a critical need to deploy new, cost-effective technologies that can routinely provide high resolution water column data on regional scales in our coastal ocean. We developed the first integrated glider platform and sensor system for sampling pH in the water column of the coastal ocean. A Deep-Sea ISFET (Ion Sensitive Field Effect Transistor) pH sensor system was modified and integrated into a Slocum G2 glider and tested during a deployment in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. Measurements of pH exhibited a time lag that shifted during the deployment, but shifts were applied to correct pH. Glider pit and spectrophotometric pH measured in discrete water samples were in good agreement for some comparisons but not others, and those offsets were likely the result of delayed or incomplete conditioning (at deployment start) or mismatches due to water sampling techniques. Glider pH data along the cross-shelf transect revealed higher pH associated with the depth of chlorophyll and oxygen maximums and a warmer, saltier water mass. Lower pit occurred in bottom waters of the middle shelf and slope, and nearshore following a period of heavy precipitation. These results demonstrate the application of glider-based acidification monitoring in other coastal regions, providing the foundation of what could become a national acidification monitoring network.

TI  - Multidisciplinary design analysis and optimisation frameworks for floating offshore wind turbines: State of the art
JO  - Ocean Engineering
PY  - 2022
VL  - 251
IS  - NA
AB  - Meeting climate and air quality targets, while preserving the focus on the reliability and cost-effectiveness of energy, became a central issue for offshore wind turbine engineers. Floating offshore wind turbines, which allow harnessing the large untapped wind resources in deep waters, are highly complex and coupled systems. Subsystem-level optimisations result in suboptimal designs, implying that an integrated design approach is important. Literature saw a few attempts on multidisciplinary design analysis and optimisation of floating wind turbines, with varying results, proving the need for an efficient, and sufficiently accurate, integrated approach. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art approaches to multidisciplinary design analysis and optimisation of floating support structures. The choice of the optimisation framework architecture, support platform design variables, constraints and objective functions are investigated. The techno-economic analysis models are closely examined, focusing on the approaches to achieving the optimum accuracyâ€“efficiency balance. It is shown that the representation of the fully coupled system within the optimisation framework requires the introduction of a more complex multidisciplinary analysis workflow. Methods to increase the efficiency of such frameworks are indicated. Non-conventional support structure configurations can be conceived through the application of more advanced parametrisation schemes, which is feasible together with design space size reduction techniques. The set of design criteria should be extended by operation and maintenance cost, and power production metrics. The main technical limitations of the frameworks adopted so far include the inability to accurately analyse a diverse range of support structure topologies in multiple design load cases within a common framework. The cost approximation models should be extended by the chosen aspects of pre-operational phases, to better explore the benefits of the floating platforms. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Environmentally friendly very large Crude carriers
JO  - Journal Of Ocean Technology
PY  - 2009
VL  - 4
IS  - 3
AB  - The reduction of the airborne emissions produced by the diesel-driven generators used aboard ships has been receiving increased attention due to the desire to improve air quality and reduce the generation of greenhouse gases. This is especially true in certain ports where airborneemission restrictions are often the most stringent and health risks due to diesel-engine exhaust are often the most acute. In this paper, the authors describe and analyze a novel arrangement in which photovoltaic (PV) panels installed on the deck of a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) produce electricity using solar energy. This electricity is then used to power an electrolyzer that produces hydrogen from water while the vessel is in transit from one port to the next. The hydrogen produced is stored during the entire voyage and, when the vessel arrives in port, is used as the fuel in a solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) that produces electricity needed by the ship. The fuel-cell system also includes a gas-turbine-driven generator and a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) and steam-turbinedriven generator (TG) to increase the electrical output and efficiency. The results of the analysis show that a combined PV and SOFC-hybrid system has the potential to be a source of shipboard electrical power that produces fewer harmful emissions and operates with a higher efficiency than the diesel-driven generators often used on ships today. Consequently, the use of a fuel-cell installed as part of a hybrid system that utilizes hydrogen generated from the sun's energy could be an environmentally friendly way to generate electricity that reduces both pollution and the dependence on fossil fuels.

AB  - The adoption of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as an alternative marine fuel is a promising solution for â€œgreen shippingâ€, with potential extensive reduction of pollutant emissions. The future development and spread of LNG technologies for ship bunkering and fuel systems operation will necessarily need to face the safety issues associated with the high flammability of LNG, compared to conventional marine fuels. In this study, a comparative analysis of the inherent safety performance of the foreseen technologies for LNG bunkering was performed. Moreover, a comparison with conventional technologies based on marine diesel fuels was also carried out. An inherent safety ranking based on overall indicators deriving from severity of consequences and credibility of loss of containment events was introduced. The results allowed the identification of the inherently safer solutions for maritime fuel bunkering, highlighting critical units and providing insights on the safety issues to be addressed for the future development of green shipping technologies.

TI  - DESIGN OF AN OFFSHORE THREE-BLADED VERTICAL AXIS WIND TURBINE FOR WIND TUNNEL EXPERIMENTS
JO  - NANA

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - The rapid shrinkage of fossil fuel sources and contrary fast-growing energy needs of social, industrial and technological enhancements, necessitate the need of different approaches to exploit the various renewable energy sources. Among the several technological alternatives, wind energy is one of the most emerging prospective because of its renewable, sustainable and environment friendly nature, especially at its offshore locations. The recent growth of the offshore wind energy market has significantly increased the technological importance of the offshore vertical axis wind turbines, both as floating or fixed installations. Particularly, the class of lift driven vertical axis wind turbines is very promising; however, the existing design and technology is not competent enough to meet the global need of offshore wind energy. In this context, the project AEROPITCH co-investigated by EOLFI, CORETI and IRPHE aims at the development of a robust and sophisticated offshore vertical axis wind turbine, which would bring decisive competitive advantage in the offshore wind energy market. In this paper, simulations have been performed on the various airfoils of NACA 4-series, 5-series and Selig profiles at different chord Reynolds numbers of 60000, 100000 and 140000 using double multiple streamtube model with tip loss correction. Based on the power coefficient, the best suitable airfoil S1046 has been selected for a 3-bladed vertical axis wind turbine. Besides the blade profile, the turbine design parameters such as aspect ratio and solidity ratio have also been investigated by varying the diameter and chord of the blade. Further, a series of wind tunnel experiments will be performed on the developed wind turbine, and the implementation of active pitch control in the developed turbine will be investigated in future research.

AB  - There are increasing concerns and regulations regarding the emission of pollutants from shipping. Therefore, regulations such as the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) and Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) have been made mandatory to cope with climate change concerns. To put these efforts into practice, the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) was introduced in 2009 to account for the fuel consumption, distance travelled by the vessel and cargo mass. However, it is stated that these do not apply to ships that are not engaged in transport work such as research vessels and tugboats. These short sea shipping vessels have been neglected under current indexes and it is not possible for their properties to be quantified since current indices are for vessels carrying loads. The numbers of these specialised vessels are increasing in local waters, and are closer to coastal communities where concerns and impact from these pollutants would be more direct. In the IMO greenhouse gas study, options for improving energy efficiency in terms of design includes the concept, design speed and capability, hull and superstructure, power and propulsion whilst the principle of energy efficiency in terms of operation includes fleet management, logistics and incentives, voyage optimisation and energy management. A reliable energy flow breakdown architecture and diagnostics for these smaller vessels is important and will contribute to an understanding of the energy production, distribution and consumption on-board. This feeds into the IMO plan to encourage energy management. A systematic approach consisting of five distinct stages is recommended to accomplish a holistic approach for energy efficiency management. This includes understanding of energy flow breakdown architecture, vessel survey to understand operation and conduct, review existing sensors and new sensor installation, sensor communication and data processing, and finally data analysis. These stages are addressed in this paper to provide an overall understanding of a robust energy efficiency audit procedure and sensor matrix. This includes unifying the existing on-board sensors with the proposed new sensors for additional data collection where primary parameters are not readily available. Inferred secondary parameter calculations are also applied where direct data collection is not possible. This will allow information from the vessel to be transmitted to a common platform to enable detailed data analysis. The aim of this work is to improve energy management and monitoring, which leads to understanding and managing consumption of energy. A case study of this methodology has been carried out on the Princess Royal, a Newcastle University research vessel. Recommendations for further testing and optimisation of this methodology will be applied to tugboats and Offshore Supply Vessels (OSV). Â© Copyright 2017 ASME.

Creating new offshore wind-power developments will require a variety of ground investigation projects. For example, for assessing turbine locations and cable routes onto shore, as well as to investigate potential increased infrastructure developments at the ports servicing the offshore energy market. Having undertaken the initial geophysical survey in 2003, ESG Soil Mechanics returned to the Teesside project in 2008 and 2010, to provide geotechnical site investigation information to further reduce the risks to the main works contract. Before mobilization in the field, ESG Soil Mechanics produced a project plan. This detailed all of the relevant methods of work; the hazards and risks associated with the project; and then identified the appropriate safe systems of work to eliminate them, where possible.

JO  - Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences Of The United States Of America
PY  - 2008

AB  - The fresh water discharged by large rivers such as the Amazon is transported hundreds to thousands of kilometers away from the coast by surface plumes. The nutrients delivered by these river plumes contribute to enhanced primary production in the ocean, and the sinking flux of this new production results in carbon sequestration. Here, we report that the Amazon River plume supports N2 fixation far from the mouth and provides important pathways for sequestration of atmospheric CO2 in the western tropical North Atlantic (WTNA). We calculate that the sinking of carbon fixed by diazotrophs in the plume sequesters 1.7 Tmol of C annually, in addition to the sequestration of 0.6 Tmol of C yr-1 of the new production supported by NO3 delivered by the river. These processes revise our current understanding that the tropical North Atlantic is a source of 2.5 Tmol of C to the atmosphere [Mikaloff-Fletcher SE, et al. (2007) Inverse estimates of the oceanic sources and sinks of natural CO2 and the implied oceanic carbon transport. Global Biogeochem Cycles 21, doi:10.1029/2006GB002751].

AB  - Marine hybrid power systems fed by so-called "alternative fuels"are key enablers to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from ship propulsion and reaching international targets, particularly for large vessels. In this paper, a few scenarios of green propulsion are studied based on low-emission energy carriers, marine batteries, and all-electric power architecture. A cost model is proposed to optimise the power system via minimising the fuel consumption and hence, the operational expenses (OPEX). The proposed cost model includes the different types of fuels and a battery cycling and battery energy dissipation term. The result is an optimal energy management system (EMS) based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that is tuned for alternative fuel. The optimised EMS is tested on a commercial LNG vessel, and it enables a more stable use of generators. However, as the paper reveals, optimised control strategies will not yield practical results in reaching international emission targets. Hence, alternative fuels will be pivotal in reducing emissions from shipping. Â© 2022 IEEE.

Two other major areas of concern involving the marine application of biofuels center on oxidation stability and water content. The downside of biodiesels is the pressure on availability, the lack of any cost benefit over traditional marine fuels, doubts about stability, and the fact that there is no current marine specification. Unless production techniques are improved, biodiesels will remain a minor blend component.

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - In recent years polymer flooding has been field tested extensively and has succeeded in many Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) projects. The use of synthetic polymers in EOR is undesirable from an environmental perspective. Further, due to limitations of the existing synthetic polymers in high temperature and high salinity conditions, thermal degradation among other drawbacks, biopolymers have attracted the attention of the petroleum Industry. Recently, the use of biopolymer schizophyllan for polymer flooding operations has been found to have advantages such as stability under high temperature and high salinity conditions. This biopolymer is commercially produced from the fungus schizophyllum commune using glucose as a carbon source via fermentation process and is currently available in small quantities as an expensive purified pharmaceutical and cosmetic grade material. Our study aims to utilize locally available sources in Malaysia to synthesize the above biopolymer making it cost effective. The fungus schizophyllum commune commonly known as "cendawan kukur" in Malaysia was used as a starting material. Different production media containing carbon and nitrogen sources, required for the growth of the fungus, were utilized for the biopolymer production. Initial viscosity studies carried out using rheometer showed that, the production media comprising sago starch as the carbon source and potato extract as the nitrogen source, showed the highest viscosity value of 0.12 Pa-s at 30Â°C. Therefore, this media was chosen as the most favorable media for the biopolymer production. Further, the biopolymer extracted from this media was identified by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy which showed similarity in chemical structure with reference to commercial schizophyllan data from the literature. The results from Thermo Gravimetric (TG) analysis showed that the biopolymer was thermally stable at higher temperatures similar to that of the commercial schizophyllan. This study would develop the utilization of locally available sources to produce schizophyllan for polymer flooding operations by explaining various characteristics so as to meet the expected requirements for it to be applied in an oil field.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 69
IS  - NA
AB  - Maritime industry is in constant pursuit of viable alternatives in order to comply with present and imminent regulations which address pollution by marine fuels. Cost/emission estimates, which determine the efficacy of compliance options, rely heavily on bottom-up methodologies for estimating fuel consumptions. These methodologies employ representative databases for their estimates instead of actual in-situ data. The use of in-situ data is therefore of paramount importance for accuracy of end results on which industry-wide strategic decisions are based. Moreover, total fuel consumption of a potential alternative is calculated simply using energy conversion factors in comparison to a conventional fuel. However, each compliance-option comprises of unique process-components which demand diverse operational, electrical and heating energy requirements which in turn alter their fuel consumptions and emission inventories. Therefore, each compliance-pathway should be assessed individually using in-situ data in order to estimate fuel consumptions and emission inventories rather than using energy conversion factors between them. A case study which utilizes in-situ data is conducted to assess the effect of fuel-specific processes on energy/operational demand and the emission estimates between residual heavy fuel-oils and liquefied natural-gas for a bulk carrier. The findings reveal that allocation and apportion of fuel-specific electrical/heating energy demands as well as operational components to each compliance option would produce more accurate emission estimates as well as realistic cost comparisons. Moreover, the study endorses that the use of natural gas as a marine fuel is highly commendable and asserts that in fact more emission reductions can be achieved than previously estimated.

JO  - International Gas Union World Gas Conference Papers
PY  - 2012
VL  - 1
IS  - NA
AB  - Today, greenhouse gases and exhaust gas emissions are rightly high on the agenda for all ships owners, operators and charterers. With this in mind, a Charterer Certificate (Green Award Certificate) can be awarded to those demonstrating reduced emissions and fuel oil consumption and increased shipping efficiency. Therefore, a working group of maritime companies (Qatargas Operating Company Ltd. (QG), RasGas Company Ltd. (RG), ConocoPhillips and Rio Tinto) was established to develop a strategy to meet and demonstrate the targets required to achieve this Charterer Certificate. The group has identified the operation of Dual Fuel Main Engine Gas Injection (ME-GI) Engines as a way to help do so. In consideration of the above, a total of 45 Q-Flex and Q-Max vessels chartered to Qatargas Operating Company Ltd. (QG) and RasGas Company Ltd. (RG) are being considered for conversion to Dual Fuel Gas Injection (ME-GI) Engine. Using Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) vapour for the operation of Electronically Controlled High Pressure Gas Injection Engine for propulsion of ships, the conversion work will significantly reduce the emissions when compared with Marine Diesel Oil (MDO) and/or Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) in terms of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), Sulphur Oxides (SOx) and particulate matter (PM). Therefore, there are clear environmental benefits for using this fuel in the main engines along with a general reduction in particulate emissions. Taking into consideration, the relative differences in fuel prices and the strong requirements for lowering engine emissions the interest for using the LNG gas as fuel in the QG and RG LNG carriers has increased. In addition the ME-GI engine has the flexibility to combust both QG and RG gas compositions. Using LNG as a fuel will not affect engine performance in terms of speed, thermal efficiency or power output, and will maintain the same rating as for the fuel oil burning engine. LNG is destined to become the preferred energy source of the future in many areas of the world, and very few doubt this prediction. Hence, as there will most likely be an overcapacity in LNG production and tanker tonnage, this has generated additional interest in using LNG as a fuel source for ocean-bound vessels as it is expected to be cheaper than other types of fuel. This is especially true for vessels trading in Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECA) as they are required to burn Low-Sulphur fuels when within 200 nautical miles of any port or terminal within such an area. As such, it is felt that the cost savings will be even greater if the LNG fuel price is compared against the price for other types of Low- Sulphur fuels. This paper describes the operating philosophy and scope of works that will be required for the retrofit conversion of the Q-Flex and Q-Max vessels to ME-GI duel fuel two-stroke engines.

VL  - 19

AB  - The increasing seaborne transportation of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) in the current volatile global market and energy supply environment puts a pressure on LNG vessels to be more efficient, environmentally friendly, and costeffective. Modern LNG carriers feature complex and tightly integrated machinery systems to convert the onboard primary energy sources to useful energy demands for propulsion, electricity and heat. Therefore, process modelling and simulation techniques combined with an integrated systems approach is required for the evaluation of different configuration alternatives of LNG carriers. In this paper, we used our in-house process modelling framework DNVGL COSSMOS to develop a generic model of an LNG carrier integrated machinery system encompassing various propulsion and energy recovery technologies. The resulting system model was then coupled with a generic operational profile description accounting for various operating modes and intended trading routes of the vessel. The integrated LNG carrier machinery process model was subsequently used for the evaluation of different technology alternatives and machinery configurations. Namely, the model was used to size the gas-fuel compression trains; assess the introduction and optimal size of an LNG reliquefaction plant; compare electric and mechanical propulsion technologies; and, assess the introduction of energy recovery technologies such as shaft generators and exhaust gas economizers. The model-based studies resulted in an improved insight of this complex integrated machinery arrangement, revealing important performance trade-offs and interrelations between the vessel's sub-systems. The results revealed high energy savings potential of 5% to 8% depending on the energy recovery options implemented, operating profile and trading route. At the same time fuel savings of about 6% were identified, improving the overall cost-effectiveness of the integrated system.

JO  - NANA

AB  - The main engine internal combustion and friction of moving parts generate great amount of heat. This heat should be maintained within maker temperature thresholds. This is ensured by main engine fresh water-cooling system which circulate the fresh water in a closed loop and which is cooled in its turn by the seawater cooling system, using seawater as cooling fluid media. Then the hot seawater is thrown overboard ship. The heat generated by friction of the moving parts is absorbed by the lubricating oil system. This cooling process represent a great heat loss that is originally produced by consumption of fuel oil. This leads to the increase of fuel consumption and production of greenhouse gases. This paper proposes one of the design measures, to recover the waste heat, by using the hot main engine fresh water outlet for the heating of the accommodation sanitary water and quantifies the reduction of the greenhouse gases resulting in, for and efficient energy management and to comply with international maritime organization ship energy efficiency plan requirements.

AB  - Organic matter accumulation, the net effect of plant production and decomposition, contributes to vertical soil accretion in coastal wetlands, thereby playing a key role in whether they keep pace with sea level rise. Any factor that affects decomposition may affect wetland accretion, including atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Higher CO2 can influence decomposition rates by altering plant tissue chemistry or by causing shifts in plant species composition or biomass partitioning. A combined greenhouse-field experiment examined how elevated CO2 affected plant tissue chemistry and subsequent decomposition of above- and belowground tissues of two common brackish marsh species, Schoenoplectus americanus (C-3) and Spartina patens (C-4). Both species were grown in monoculture and in mixture under ambient (350-385 mu L L-1) or elevated (ambient + 300 mu L L-1) atmospheric CO2 conditions, with all other growth conditions held constant, for one growing season. Above- and belowground tissues produced under these treatments were decomposed under ambient field conditions in a brackish marsh in the Mississippi River Delta, USA. Elevated CO2 significantly reduced nitrogen content of S. americanus, but not sufficiently to affect subsequent decomposition. Instead, long-term decomposition (percent mass remaining after 280 d) was controlled by species composition and tissue type. Shoots of S. patens had more mass remaining (41 +/- 2\%) than those of S. americanus (12 +/- 2\%). Belowground material decomposed more slowly than that placed aboveground (62 +/- 1\% vs. 23 +/- 3\% mass remaining), but rates belowground did not differ between species. Increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration will likely have a greater effect on overall decomposition in this brackish marsh community through shifts in species dominance or biomass allocation than through effects on tissue chemistry. Consequent changes in organic matter accumulation may alter marsh capacity to accommodate sea-level rise through vertical accretion. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The pollution of land and water by petroleum compounds is a matter of growing concern necessitating the development of methodologies, including microbial biodegradation, to minimize the impending impacts. It has been extensively reported that fungi from polluted habitats have the potential to degrade pollutants, including petroleum compounds. The Red Sea is used extensively for the transport of oil and is substantially polluted, due to leaks, spills, and occasional accidents. Tidal water, floating debris, and soil sediment were collected from mangrove stands on three polluted sites along the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia and forty-five fungal isolates belonging to 13 genera were recovered from these samples. The isolates were identified on the basis of a sequence analysis of the 18S rRNA gene fragment. Nine of these isolates were found to be able to grow in association with engine oil, as the sole carbon source, under in vitro conditions. These selected isolates and their consortium accumulated greater biomass, liberated more CO2, and produced higher levels of extracellular enzymes, during cultivation with engine oil as compared with the controls. These observations were authenticated by gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS) analysis, which indicated that many high mass compounds present in the oil before treatment either disappeared or showed diminished levels.

IS  - NA
AB  - Greenhouse gas shall be reduced from shipping sector. For that purpose the regulation of EEDI (energy efficiency design index for new ships) and SEEMP (ship energy efficiency management plan) have been entry into force from 2013. In order to improve the energy efficiency in ship operation it is necessary to predict the fuel consumption accurately. In actual seas the wave effect is the dominant component of the external forces. In particular it is well known the bow shape above water affects the added resistance in waves. To reflect the effect of the bow shape a method which takes into account the result of simplified tank tests is proposed here. Using the results of tank tests the effect of the bow shape above water can be evaluated with accuracy as well as with robustness. Regarding to the fuel consumption it should be evaluated by combining the ship hydrodynamic performance with the engine characteristics. Especially the operating limits of the main engine, such as the torque limit and the over load protection, are affected to the ship hydrodynamic performance. In rough weather condition the revolution of the main engine will be reduced to be below the operating limits of the engine. This causes the large decrease of ship speed. To prevent the increase of fuel consumption, a control system by Fuel Index as an index of fuel injection has been applied to some ships. The calculation method for the fuel consumption by using Fuel Index is presented. In this paper following contents are reported; 1) development of a calculation method for the added resistance due to waves combined with the simplified tank tests in short waves, 2) comparison of the calculation method with onboard measurement, 3) development of a calculation method for the fuel consumption considering the engine operating mode in actual seas and 4) comparison of the method with onboard measurement of a container ship. From these investigations the availability of the present method is confirmed. Copyright Â© 2013 by ASME.

AB  - Carbon dioxide emissions have become a growing problem worldwide. Global institutions are addressing this problem and developing solutions. Countries that are aware of this problem are implementing regulations that affect global industry and, in particular, maritime transport. Considering that the combustion process, namely, diesel, remains the main energy conversion process on board ships, the question arises: what is the best solution to reduce pollutant emissions? Coastal countries have taken various measures to reduce the emission of harmful gases into the marine environment. The problem with these measures is that it is difficult to accurately predict their impact. This paper looks at one of these measures (slow-steaming) to determine how it affects carbon dioxide emissions from different types of ships and their modes of operation. Engine room simulators were used to study two marine power plants under different operating conditions. Fuel consumption was measured, i.e., flows from heavy fuel oil and diesel oil service tanks to all consumers, and carbon emissions were calculated accordingly. The study showed a large reduction in carbon dioxide emissions in the case of a modern power plant ship, and large deviations when all operating modes were compared.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 70
IS  - 3-4
AB  - Seagrass meadows have long been recognized for their high ecological and economic value (ecosystem services). More recently, a potential role in climate regulation, due to their ability to fix and sequester carbon, has been the focus of intensive study. In the Mediterranean Sea, the matte, a specific structure built by the seagrass Posidonia oceanica, is of particular interest because it keeps buried for thousands of years massive amounts of carbon. Recent studies carried out along the Corsican coasts show a mean fixation of 1.62 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), with a sequestration rate of between 27 and 30 \%, a mean matte thickness of 210 cm and 711 Mg C ha(-1) of organic carbon trapped in the matte. That is to say, a stock corresponding to 1,580 years of P. oceanica carbon sequestration, confirmed by radiocarbon analysis. An extrapolation to the Mediterranean basin (1.0 to 1.5 million hectares covered by P. oceanica meadow; mean matte thickness: 210 cm) shows that the total stock of organic carbon sequestered in the P. oceanica matte might be as much as 711 to 1,067 million Mg C. The conservation of the P. oceanica meadows thus constitutes an issue of major importance since any degradation of the matte, which has been built up over the past millennia, would very likely result in the release of considerable quantities of carbon. Rather than playing a major role in the attenuation of the impact of climate change (blue carbon sequestration), the P. oceanica meadow would then become a source of carbon that would be likely to amplify the greenhouse gas emissions. Management of P. oceanica meadows should take into account not only their role in carbon sequestration, but also the whole the full range of their ecosystem services, in relation with the functioning of the ecosystem.

AB  - Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) is a network of profiling floats carrying sensors that enable observation of as many as six essential biogeochemical and bio-optical variables: oxygen, nitrate, pH, chlorophyll a, suspended particles, and downwelling irradiance. This sensor network represents today's most promising strategy for collecting temporally and vertically resolved observations of biogeochemical properties throughout the ocean. All data are freely available within 24 hours of transmission. These data fill large gaps in ocean-observing systems and support three ambitions: gaining a better understanding of biogeochemical processes (e.g., the biological carbon pump and air sea CO2 exchanges) and evaluating ongoing changes resulting from increasing anthropogenic pressure (e.g., acidification and deoxygenation); managing the ocean (e.g., improving the global carbon budget and developing sustainable fisheries); and carrying out exploration for potential discoveries. The BGC-Argo network has already delivered extensive high-quality global data sets that have resulted in unique scientific outcomes from regional to global scales. With the proposed expansion of BGC-Argo in the near future, this network has the potential to become a pivotal observation system that links satellite and ship-based observations in a transformative manner.

Especially it has a great application prospect in the field of UHV transmission and offshore transmission of large-scale wind power. But the metal particle contamination in GIS/GIL is the key technical problem to improve the equipment insulation strength. We introduce the charged mechanism and stress analysis of a metal particle in GIS/GIL, and analyze the influences of AC, DC or impulse voltages on particle motion and GIS/GIL insulation. Furthermore, we compare the typical insulation faults of GIS/GIL caused by particle contamination, namely the gap breakdown caused by moving particles and surface flashover on insulator adhered by particles. In addition,we summarize the current main particle suppression measures and their mechanisms. Finally, we point out the defects of the existing researches in particle pollution of GIS/GIL and put forward some possible solutions. Â© 2016, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI.

AB  - In Brazil, few studies have been conducted about the assimilation of carbon and biomass accumulation in mangroves despite its great role as a carbon sink. In this sense, this study aimed to estimate the aboveground biomass (AGB) and carbon stocked by mangrove species in a stretch along the Piraque-Acu River in southeastern Brazil, and to verify their relation with some soil parameters. For such, the height and diameter of all trees inside six plots of 100 m(2) were measured and used to quantify AGB through an allometric equation, and soil samples were collected to calculate granulometry, humidity, time of infiltration and permeability. Multiple regressions were used to identify relations between AGB and soil parameters. A total of 296 trees were found in the area and the AGB and carbon assimilated were 48.61 t ha(-1) and 24.30 t ha(-1), respectively. Laguncularia racemosa was the most abundant species and contributed with 61\% of these values. Only a positive relation between AGB/carbon of L. racemosa and soil humidity was found, probably due to the substrate characteristics which contain a large concentration of silt/clay, and may store more water and do not yet provide firmness to the roots. By comparison, this mangrove had a low amount of AGB and carbon stocked and has yet to develop structurally. Along with other ecological functions and its associated ecosystem services such as supplying food for the local community, these features highlight the importance to conserve the studied mangrove and the interlinked coastal ecosystems.

The underwater acoustic communication technique ordinarily governs the usage of clout. The networkâ€™s capability to communicate the collected facts is affected due to minimal renewing capacity in case of the underwater wireless sensor network. The proposed work describes the reliable resources available in underwater for the sensors. The proposed scheme provides the mechanism for energy harvesting from tidal energy into electrical energy to charge the Li-ion cells used in sensors. To cover the maximum area of the ocean sensor, the data aggregators are deployed at three different levels (i.e. bottom, middle and top levels). The sensors deployed in oceans at the top level are static, whereas they are mobile at middle and bottom levels. Â© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

JO  - Journal Of Geophysical Research-oceans

IS  - C9
AB  - Oceanic CO2 levels are expected to rise during the next 2 centuries to levels not seen for 10 - 150 million years by the uptake of atmospheric CO2 in surface waters or potentially through the disposal of waste CO2 in the deep sea. Changes in ocean chemistry caused by CO2 influx may have broad impacts on ocean ecosystems. Physiological processes animals use to cope with CO2- related stress are known, but the range of sensitivities and effects of changes in ocean chemistry on most ocean life remain unclear. We evaluate the effectiveness of various designs for in situ CO2 release experiments in producing stable perturbations in seawater chemistry over experimental seafloor plots, as is desirable for evaluating the CO2 sensitivities of deep sea animals. We also discuss results from a subset of these experiments on the impacts of hypercapnia on deep sea meiofauna, in the context of experimental designs. Five experiments off central California show that pH perturbations were greatest for experiments using `` point source'' CO2 pools surrounded by experimental plots. CO2 enclosure experiments with experimental plots positioned within a circular arrangement of CO2 pools had more moderate pH variation. The concentration of dissolution plumes from CO2 pools were related to the speed and turbulence of near- bottom currents, which influence CO2 dissolution and advection. Survival of meiofauna ( nematodes, amoebae, euglenoid flagellates) was low after episodic severe hypercapnia but lower and variable where pH changes ranged from 0 to 0.2 pH units below normal.

AB  - Due to the increasing impact of ship emissions on the environment and the preventive measures of current regulations introduced by the International Maritime Organization to significantly reduce them, the development of ocean-going all-electric ships has been addressed as a concept applied to achieve it. Being a promising technology considers the use of technology alternatives such as fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors together with the use of zero-carbon alternative fuels such as hydrogen (H2) and ammonia (NH3) as main energy sources. This article addresses a state-of-the-art on several challenges related to the ocean-going zero-emissions ship to achieve a zero-emissions shipping, based on the technology associated with hybrid and all-electric ship, and the zero-carbon fuels alternatives. In this respect, a transition from fossil fuel-based propulsion and auxiliary systems to a zero-emissions ship concept are related to the challenges to overcome the needs of energy density for these new alternatives energy sources compared to current fossil fuel options. The transitional process should consider a first step of hybridization of the propulsion and auxiliary systems of existing ships to get a baseline from where to move forward to a zero-emissions configuration for new designs.

AB  - The energy of waves in sea is renewable. Such resources do not require millions of years to generate and develop and they are endless. Energy production in this way does not have any pollution. These plants can produce the greatest amount of energy during the winter and fortunately at in such times that we need more energy. Small waveforms can be used in remote areas where power transmission is not economical. In this paper, we tried to introduce the idea of converting the energy of sea waves into electricity through a simple generative design, which can be used in any condition of the sea, given that Iran has many coasts and waves' energy can be produced from wind power. Given the fact that the machine is designed to be a turbine, it is aimed even at very low water speeds, it will turn around and the power will be generated. Therefore, this device can be used in the Persian Gulf, which has calm currents. In a wavy or even stormy weather conditions in the Caspian Sea and the rivers with high speed current, faster rotation of the machine and more power generation will be more expedient for this purpose. We also introduce how to make the model and materials used to build the original sample, so that the idea can be realized more than ever.

AB  - Upscaling Carbon Capture and Storage requires identification of suitable storage sites, with robust reservoir seals. The Utsira Formation in the northern North Sea has been flagged as a target for further storage. However, there are no regional studies of seal variability addressing heterogeneities that could facilitate seal bypass. This study aims to: (a) identify, assess and map the elements that promote or restrict fluid migration, (b) develop a matrix to regionally map containment confidence (CC) and (c) rank the different areas for CO2 containment across the Utsira Formation. The seal and overburden were mapped using a high-resolution, pre-stack depth-migrated 3D broadband seismic reflection dataset and 141 exploration wells. Seal geometry, sandstone presence and sandstone connectivity in the seal and overburden were assigned relative CC scores, which were summed to map overall CC of the Utsira Fm. Indicators for shallow gas and migration were mapped and correlated with the other elements. Areas with the lowest CC are in the west of the Utsira Fm. Here, sandstones within the Seal Interval are connected through the overburden via sandy submarine fans. In the southeast, dipping stratigraphy downlaps onto the Utsira Fm., increasing the potential for connection with glacially-derived channel-lobe systems in the overburden. The areas with the highest CC are the central and northeast parts of the Utsira Fm., where the Seal Interval is mudstone-dominated and parallel to the reservoir, and channel-lobe systems identified in the Overburden Interval are disconnected from the reservoir. This area coincides with a thick depocentre of the northern Utsira Fm. These results can be used to inform CO2 storage site selection and constrain future CO2 plume simulation analyses for the Utsira Fm. The CC matrix outlined here can also be adapted and applied to regionally assess the containment of other potential CO2 storage reservoirs in any setting.

AB  - The marine transportation industry is a significant contributor to global emissions of CO2 and other pollutants. Although marine emission standards have become increasingly stringent, increasing fuel efficiency remains the primary objective in terms of further reducing emissions and overall marine energy use. In this paper, a hybrid powertrain is investigated as a means of increasing fuel efficiency for a modern, 100 m class, passenger vessel. The hybrid powertrain includes an Energy Storage System (ESS) based on sodium sulfur (NaS) batteries and commercially available Caterpillar diesel engine-generator sets. The ship's power load profile is based on annual averages for similar vessels. A control strategy and simulation models are developed and implemented in Simulink to analyze the power and energy flows in the hybrid powertrain. The Simulink model is used to compare the base scenario of a ship without energy storage to a hybrid scenario employing a 7.5 MWh NaS battery pack with related control strategy. Annual fuel consumption is the primary measure that is used to assess efficiency. Unlike hybrid powertrains for light-duty surface vehicle transportation, which achieve efficiency gains on the order of 10-20% [8, 9, 10], the hybrid powertrain for a large ship is estimated to lower annual fuel consumption by approximately 2%. The surprisingly small level of fuel savings is explained largely by the granularity of marine power systems, which include multiple generators that can be switched on and off to maximize fuel efficiency.

AB  - This work investigates potential cost reduction trajectories of three emerging offshore renewable energy technologies (floating offshore wind, tidal stream, and wave) with respect to meet-ing ambitious cost targets set out in the Strategic Energy Technology Implementation Plans (SETâ€ Plans) for Offshore Wind and Ocean Energy. A methodology is presented which calculates target costs for current earlyâ€stage devices, starting from the 2030 SETâ€Plan levelised cost targets. Compo-nentâ€based experience curves have been applied as part of the methodology, characterised through the comparative maturity level of each technologyâ€specific cost centre. The resultant earlyâ€stage target costs are then compared with actual costs for current devices to highlight where further cost reduction is still required. It has been found that innovation and development requirements to reach these targets vary greatly between different technologies, based on their current level of technological maturity. Future funding calls and programmes should be designed with these variables in mind to support innovative developments in offshore renewables. The method presented in this paper has been applied to publicly available cost data for emerging renewable technologies and is fully adaptable to calculate the innovation requirements for specific earlyâ€stage renewable energy devices.

AB  - Many wave energy converters have been developed so far, but there are still many engineering problems to be applied to fishery buoys. Gyroscopic generators that use a rotating mass is characterized by the possibility of downsizing, but since low speed precession rotation is used to generate power, efficiency is so low that they do not work in the size of 1 m3. In this study, a new mechanism is proposed which consists of bevel gears, two clutches and gimbals to accelerate spin by transmitting precession torque mechanically to the spin shaft in order to realize high efficiency power generation by high speed spin rotation. Gear-driven gyroscopic generator using this mechanism which has higher efficiency and longer lifespan than former generators is expected to be applied to the power source of the small ocean monitoring buoys for efficient fisheries. A gyroscopic power generator using the accelerating mechanism with flywheel of diameter of 300 mm was designed, and the accelerating mechanism of the generator was manufactured. An experiment was conducted in which a rotating vibration of 0.5 Hz was applied to confirm the effectivity of the mechanism.

TI  - Recovery of dairy manure nutrients by benthic freshwater algae
JO  - Bioresource Technology
PY  - 2002
VL  - 84
IS  - 1
AB  - Harnessing solar energy to grow algal biomass on wastewater nutrients could provide a holistic solution to nutrient management problems on dairy farms. The production of algae from a portion of manure nutrients to replace high-protein feed supplements which are often imported (along with considerable nutrients) onto the farm could potentially link consumption and supply of on-farm nutrients. The objective of this research was to assess the ability of benthic freshwater algae to recover nutrients from dairy manure and to evaluate nutrient uptake rates and dry matter/crude protein yields in comparison to a conventional cropping system. Benthic algae growth chambers were operated in semi-batch mode by continuously recycling wastewater and adding manure inputs daily. Using total nitrogen (TN) loading rates of 0.64-1.03 g m(-2) d(-1), the dried algal yields were 5.3-5.5 g m(-2) d(-1). The dried algae contained 1.5-2.1\% P and 4.9-7.1\% N. At a TN loading rate of 1.03 g m(-2) d(-1), algal biomass contained 7.1\% N compared to only 4.9\% N at a TN loading rate of 0.64 g m(-2) d(-1). In the best case, algal biomass had a crude protein content of 44\%, compared to a typical corn silage protein content of 7\%. At a dry matter yield of 5.5 g m(-2) d(-1), this is equivalent to an annual N uptake rate of 1430 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). Compared to a conventional corn/rye rotation, such benthic algae production rates would require 26\% of the land area requirements for equivalent N uptake rates and 23\%, of the land area requirements on a P uptake basis. Combining conventional cropping systems with an algal treatment system could facilitate more efficient crop production and farm nutrient management, allowing dairy operations to be environmentally sustainable on fewer acres.

AB  - The route layout of submarine cable of offshore wind farm is diverse and different forms of route have a great impact on the comprehensive cost of submarine cable. In this paper, the optimization design method of submarine cable layout is studied in accordance with the electrical networking characteristics of offshore wind farm. The optimization model of submarine cable construction cost and submarine cable operation loss cost is set up. The simulated annealing algorithm is used to optimize the topology of collecting submarine cable and, with consideration of the routing structure of transmission submarine cable and with minimum comprehensive cost of submarine cable at target, the use of MATLAB interpolation fitting function to construct non-linear function of comprehensive cost of submarine cable and position of booster station within the full range of the wind farm and, on this basis, the location of the target booster station with minimum comprehensive cost is calculated so to determine the optimal layout scheme of submarine cable. A good submarine cable optimization layout scheme is obtained throughout case calculation and the comprehensive cost of submarine cable is greatly reduced. The results show that the optimization design method proposed in this paper is effective and can provide guidance for the submarine cable layout of offshore wind farm.

IS  - 57
AB  - The maritime transportation sector globally depends on fossil resources while this option is both diminishing and causing serious environmental and air pollution issues. Recently, hydrogen energy becomes one of the key alternatives addressing these concerns under the increasing press effect of the international community. The use of hydrogen as an energy source in ships is provided by fuel cell technologies. Although there are many types of fuel cells, Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) is the most widely used fuel cell type in the maritime industry. The most important handicap for the use of hydrogen in ships seems to be the production and storage of it. For this reason, fuel cell technology and hydrogen production and storage systems must be developed in order to use hydrogen as the main propulsion system in long-distance transportation in the maritime sector. In this study, Reference Energy System (RES) is established for a chemical tanker ship to determine the current energy flow from various resources to demands. Then the appropriate parameters are assigned and this framework is specified by the respective data. Following this phase; the current situation has been developed as the base scenario and analyzed by using the Low Emission Analysis Programme (LEAP) energy modeling platform. Additionally, two alternative scenarios including the hydrogen-based have been applied against the base scenario to compare the environmental results in the 2017â€“2050 time period. When the results are evaluated, it is predicted that although it is not sufficient for IMO and EMSA targets, implementation of hydrogen contributes to the carbon emission reduction positively and it will be more beneficial to apply to the main drive system with the technological developments to be made in the near future.

TI  - Multifunctional power unit by hybridizing contact-separate triboelectric nanogenerator, electromagnetic generator and solar cell for harvesting blue energy
JO  - Nano Energy
PY  - 2017
VL  - 39
IS  - NA
AB  - The complementary output of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and electromagnetic generator (EMG) can be hybridized and maximized for harvesting blue energy in a broad frequency range. How to optimally design and construct the hybrid structure still remains a challenge. In this work, we proposed a multifunctional hybrid power unit for harvesting blue energy, which consists of contact-separate mode triboelectric nanogenerators (CS-TENGs), freestanding sliding mode electromagnetic generators (FS-EMGs) and commercial water-proof silicon based solar cells (WS-SCs). When harvesting ocean wave kinetic energy, the bottom magnet in FS-EMG moves forth and back driven by the wave motion and makes the top magnet shake upward or downward, thus the two triboelectric layers of CS-TENG contact and separate constantly. The magnet pairs produce the noncontact attractive force that enables the fully enclosed packaging of the TENG part, protecting it from ambient environment. The TENGs effectively harvest low-frequency (<0.5 Hz) motion and the EMGs enable to produce larger output at relatively high frequency, achieving the purpose of harvesting blue energy in a broad frequency range. In addition, considering the adequate illumination on the sea, solar cells are easily integrated to collect solar energy simultaneously. The hybrid power unit has been demonstrated to harvest energy as a practical power source to drive LEDs directly or charge commercial supercapacitors under all weather conditions. The hybrid unit can be easily driven owing to ingenious design and multifunctional outputs.

TI  - Carbon reduction scenarios for 2050: An explorative analysis of public preferences
JO  - Energy Policy
PY  - 2013
VL  - 63
IS  - NA
AB  - This paper presents an analysis of public preferences for a low carbon future UK and compares them with three future scenarios proposed by the UK government based on data from 10,983 self-selected participants who engaged in the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change 'My2050' online simulation. Participants expressed a stronger preference for demand-side options than for supply-side ones. They also chose fuel switching (to electricity) and technical energy efficiency measures above more behaviour focused options. Renewable energy options (wind, solar, marine and hydro) were preferred to other low carbon supply options (nuclear power, carbon capture and storage), with offshore wind power more popular than onshore. Nuclear power was the least popular generation option. Acceptability of the government's three proposed scenarios was tested by comparing these scenarios with the research findings. Greatest support was suggested for the two scenarios emphasising business greenness, home energy efficiency, electrification of home heating and travel behaviour. The lowest level of support was demonstrated for the scenario based on significant growth in nuclear power with minimal increases in energy efficiency. Despite issues regarding the representivity of the sampled respondents, the work demonstrates the possibility of using outputs from the tool to assess publically preferred pathways.

AB  - Generating energy efficiency through behavioural change requires not only understanding and empathy with user interests and needs but also the fostering of energy saving awareness, a technique and framework that supports operators and ship owners. There is strong potential to make use of different technical solutions to increase energy efficiency, but many cost-efficient solutions relate to carrot-and-stick incentives for operators to minimise energy consumption. These incentives range from voyage planning with weather routing eco-driving bonus, to torque limitations and changes in company policies, all of which demonstrate that the operators' on-board importance for the energy consumption has been identified. Data collection will allow operators to make better decisions in the lifecycle of the ship from knowledge-driven design to operation, redesign and lifetime extension. Various systems are available for data acquisition, storage and analysis, some of which are delivered by well-known marine suppliers while others are stand-alone systems. The lack of standardization for data capture, transmission and analysis is a challenge, so systematic improvement is required in shipping companies to achieve energy savings. When these are achieved, they will be the result of customer requirements, cost pressure or individual driving forces in the companies. The potential energy savings, brought up in interviews, shows up to 35\% on specific routes and up to 60\% in specific maneuvers. These savings will be made feasible by operators and crews being involved in the decision-making process.

TI  - Probabilistic analysis of Vette fault stability in potential CO2 storage site Smeaheia, offshore Norway
JO  - International Journal Of Greenhouse Gas Control
PY  - 2021
VL  - 108
IS  - NA
AB  - Reliable assessment of fault stability is key for safe CO2 storage in a saline aquifer in fault-bounded structures. The Alpha structure located in the Vette fault's footwall in the Smeaheia area, offshore Norway, is one of the potential CO2 storage sites with a fault-bounded three-way closure. Assessing fault stability in the Smeaheia area is challenging because of the uncertainties associated with the subsurface fault properties (i.e., fault rock lithologies, strength and geometry of faults, etc.). Besides, CO2 injection-related pore pressure changes is another critical factor for mechanical deformation and potential failure. We employed a stochastic analytical approach to assess the probability of Vette fault failure using the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) and First Order Reliability Method (FORM). The possible fault smear scenarios of the Vette fault zone are evaluated by interpreting the seismic section and the detailed geological understanding. Each scenario's likelihood and the corresponding probability of failure are then integrated stochastically using an event tree method. Overall, Vette fault's system reliability shows a good to average performance range, which has a system probability of failure between 10âˆ’3 to 10-4. This finding suggests that the Vette fault will likely act as a potential barrier during CO2 injection into the Alpha structure. Moreover, the sensitivity study reveals that the stresses (both horizontal and vertical) and fault rock strength (i.e., cohesion and friction angle) are the most crucial parameters to characterize uncertainty reduction.

JO  - Biogeosciences
PY  - 2013
VL  - 10
IS  - 10
AB  - Increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide drive accompanying changes in the marine carbonate system as carbon dioxide (CO2) enters seawater and alters ocean pH (termed ``ocean acidification{''}). However, such changes do not occur in isolation, and other environmental factors have the potential to modulate the consequences of altered ocean chemistry. Given that physiological mechanisms used by organisms to confront acidification can be energetically costly, we explored the potential for food supply to influence the response of Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) larvae to ocean acidification. In laboratory experiments, we reared oyster larvae under a factorial combination of pCO(2) and food level. Elevated pCO(2) had negative effects on larval growth, total dry weight, and metamorphic success, but high food availability partially offset these influences. The combination of elevated pCO(2) and low food availability led to the greatest reduction in larval performance. However, the effects of food and pCO(2) interacted additively rather than synergistically, indicating that they operated independently. Despite the potential for abundant resources to counteract the consequences of ocean acidification, impacts were never completely negated, suggesting that even under conditions of enhanced primary production and elevated food availability, impacts of ocean acidification may still accrue in some consumers.

AB  - The maritime transportation sector is one of the main contributors to global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has adopted a strategy to reduce these emissions from international shipping >50% by 2050, compared to 2008's emissions. Therefore, ship owners need to adopt solutions to bring emissions within these and other future limits by means of environmentally friendly fuels (hydrogen or hydrogen carriers) and high efficiency propulsion technologies (fuel cells). This paper focuses on the replacement of the conventional Diesel genset installed on a hybrid small-size ferry, with an innovative system based on PEMFC technology. A real case scenario is investigated: the total energy/power demand of the vessel is determined basing on a typical operational profile. Then, a preliminary redesign of its powertrain configuration is proposed along with an energy management strategy. The analysis has allowed to define the hydrogen consumption for a daily operation. Finally, different storage technologies involving both compressed and liquefied hydrogen have been considered and compared, in order to identify ship's weight and space requirements.

AB  - In the carbon-neutral scenarios fixed by most developed countries, wind and solar resources play a significant role due to their substantial potential. Their instability can be mitigated through smarter designs of energy systems, including sector coupling and cross-border interconnections, which require detailed information on the spatial and temporal evolution of these intermittent resources. The present study aims at estimating the spatialâ€“temporal energy potential of wind in Japan based on meteorological weather data. These data allow to analyze the potential of resources sharing to reduce power generationâ€™s lack and excess, even in such an isolated country due to its variety of climate conditions and local energy demand. The correlation skewness is introduced as a measure of the sitesâ€™ uniqueness to identify important sites for the spatial distribution of capacity toward the efficient stabilization of supply at a national scale in a model-free fashion.

AB  - Brown macroalgae are an attractive, untapped resource and a favourable alternative for conventional fossil fuels, given their low lignin and high polysaccharide content. However, the restricted bioavailability of structurally complex carbohydrates for digestion, results in a low biomethane potential. This paper reviews the various pretreatment technologies explored to optimise saccharification prior to fermentation, categorised as: physical, biological, chemical, thermal and a combination of methods. A techno-economic assessment was conducted to evaluate the commercial viability of each process. Hydrothermal pretreatment proves the most promising technique for brown algae application, since it improves methane productivity, carries a net positive energy balance and generates a bio-fertilizer, while mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Pilot scale research is necessary to evaluate the feasibility of full-scale implementation for brown algae bioconversion. A case study of the Cambi (TM) process concludes the paper as it exemplifies the successful utilisation of hydrothermal pretreatment for sewage sludge biogas production.

AB  - The success of carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects depends on the ability of storage sites to contain CO2 without leakage; and the ability to convince regulators and the general public in the safety of the technology. If leakage were to occur after formal closure of the injection site, this could be over small areas from discrete point sources, such as abandoned wells, resulting in localised high concentrations of CO2 in near-surface ecosystems. Consequently, studies of the potential environmental consequences of CCS have focused on near-surface ecosystems and, as a result, environmental impacts of localised elevated CO2 on terrestrial and marine ecosystems are areas of active research. However, a CO2 storage site, in itself, could also impact on deep subsurface microbial ecosystem and biogeochemical processes, potentially affecting groundwater quality. Using a microbial energetics approach, the significance of these impacts can be scoped with a simple evaluation tool. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - DC collection system for an offshore wind farm has become an alternative to AC system. Since the DC system requires high-cost converter technology to be integrated to existing AC grid, the cost of overall system becomes a concern. Submarine XLPE collection cable connecting wind turbines with substation is part of the electrical system cost. Effective cable layout design and right cable size selection can contribute to cost reduction. This paper presents a DC collection system layout optimization for offshore wind farm using Genetic Algorithm and Traveling Salesman Problem. The cable cost is minimized as an objective function considering cable power losses, cable cross-section, and cable length. Case studies are conducted considering fix substation locations and optimum number of feeders are identified. Results are compared with optimized AC layout in an earlier study and show that DC collection system cable cost has superiority over AC system cost. Â© 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The Energy Efficiency Design Index is a new regulation which is being developed by the International Maritime Organization to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from ships. This Paper highlights various problems, which are expected to occur with the introduction of the index. Especially fast RoRo and RoPax vessels for coastal transportation are subject to those restrictions and might therefore have enormous problems to achieve the required index. The reduction of the ship speed seems to be the only possible way to reduce the attained EEDI in such a way to be able to fulfill the new guideline for fast ships. For a standard 200m Ferry only a speed not higher than about 22 knots will be allowed. Based on various examples, the application of the EEDI for fast RoRo and RoPax vessels is explained and the expected problems are described. In addition, the impact of the index on the design process itself will be shown and new design concepts are presented. Furthermore, this thesis will give some recommendations how to optimize a ship for minimizing the EEDI while maximizing design speed of the vessel. Â© 2011 American Society of Naval Engineers.

AB  - World climate change challenges and the world's consistent growing demand for energy during the past decade have brought the need to explore for more renewable energy resources. The continuation of exploring green energy sources results Osmotic Power- a new emission-free source of sustainable energy that can be used to generate electricity. Osmotic power plant is only feasible in places where rivers flow out to the ocean. The leading virtue of osmotic power is that it would be capable to produce a steady and reliable supply of renewable base load power as an alternative of other variable sources like solar or wind. There are some hurdles to generate osmotic power. Developing suitable membrane and initial construction cost are top on of them. Though Osmotic power is years from commercial feasibility but researchers think that it could provide thousands of terawafts of base load power per year around the globe. This paper presents an overview of osmotic power generation system with the analysis of potential benefits and limitations of it.

JO  - Applied Energy
PY  - 2021
VL  - 282
IS  - NA
AB  - Conversion of biomass into biofuel and biochar with a subsequent soil storage is assumed as a prospective strategy of reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. However, substantial uncertainties exist in this field regarding the country-level potential of biochar carbon sequestration, indirect effects of biochar implementation on overall environment, and dominating factors. This study conducted a life cycle assessment of country-wide incorporation of biochar in agriculture, and associated potential benefits. Results showed that over 920 kg CO2e (CO2-equivalent) could be sequestrated via converting 1 t of crop residues into biochar. As an example, based on crop residues availability statistics for China in 2014, the estimated annual carbon sequestration potential could be as high as 0.50 Pg CO2e (1 Pg = 1 Ã— 109 t). The most significant potential for biochar carbon sequestration was identified in the central south, east and northeast of China, which contributed 65% of the national biochar carbon sequestration potential. The biochar system could also contribute to mitigation of the following environmental problems: marine aquatic biodiversity destruction, surface soil and water acidification, etc. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that biochar yield, carbon content in biochar, electricity conversion efficiencies of bio-oil and pyrolysis gas were the critical parameters determining the biochar system's overall carbon sequestration potential and environmental effects. This study provides guidance on evaluating biochar's potential carbon sequestration capacity and comprehensive environmental impacts, as well as research and development needs. Â© 2020

AB  - One of the promising ways in environmental protection of the marine internal combustion engines (ICE) is the neutralization of harmful substances in exhaust gas through engine gas recirculation (EGR) technology. However, the use of such techniques conflicts with the engine's energy efficiency and leads to increased fuel consumption. It is promising to use technologies that would increase fuel and energy efficiency of ICE with EGR systems and combine high environmental efficiency with engine fuel efficiency. The technology of precooling intake air at the suction of turbocharger by waste heat using chiller (WHUCh) was developed for ICE with the EGR system. The advantage of this solution is the possibility of using the waste heat of recirculation gases to reduce the heat load on the scrubber recycling system and fuel consumption. The scheme-design solution of the EGR system using the heat of recirculation gas by an ejector chiller (ECh) for cooling the air at the intake of the main ship engine is proposed. The effect of using the heat of recirculation gas for cooling engine intake air is analyzed, taking into account the changing climatic conditions on a vessel's route line. It is shown that using the heat of recirculation gas for cooling engine intake air by ejector refrigeration machine reduces the air temperature at the entrance of the main engine by 5-15 degrees C, which decreases the specific fuel consumption by 0.5-1.4 g/(kW.h). It reduces emissions of harmful substances (NOx by 26-38\%; SOx by 9-14\%) when the engine is running with recirculation of gas.

TI  - Geochemical mapping of a blue carbon zone: Investigation of the influence of riverine input on tidal affected zones in Bull Island
JO  - Regional Studies In Marine Science
PY  - 2021
VL  - 45
IS  - NA
AB  - Bull Island (BI) is a coastal sand spit that formed as an unintended consequence of the construction of two walls, built over 200 years ago in Dublin Port, Ireland to alleviate silting of the shipping route. A large lagoon, on the land side of the island was separated in 1964 by the construction of a causeway to produce two separate lagoons that are now impacted by different water sources. Here we investigate the influence of riverine inputs on the two adjacent but unconnected tidal wetland lagoons. The South lagoon (SL) is supplied by tidal water passing through the eutrophic R. Liffey and R. Tolka estuary zones, while the North Lagoon (NL) is supplied by seawater and to a lesser degree, freshwater from the R. Liffey plume. Within each of these zones a clear ecotone exists between the mudflats (MF) and vegetated saltmarshes (SM). We determined the quantity and distributions of bulk geochemical characteristics across BI's sediments, including total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), metals, and also, 16 individual polyromantic hydrocarbon's (PAH's) as an indication of anthropogenic input. Primary focus was placed on studying the blue carbon sediments of the lagoon zones. Significant differences in analytical results showed major influences exerted on sediment geochemistry within each lagoon. This study highlights the ability of a functioning coastal wetland to flourish and sequester elevated levels of carbon, metals and pollutants under the constraints of increasing anthropogenic impact. As the inadvertent result of geo-engineering, BI and its environs is a very important site to investigate the potential of artificially constructed wetlands to act as blue carbon reservoirs.

AB  - Renewable energy systems become more present in the energy market and wind power has already proven it's potential. The offshore wind farms have also been continuing its growth rapidly due to much better wind conditions like onshore wind farms. The studied system here is a variable speed wind generation system based on Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG). In this topology, stator side converter and rotor side converter is used to implement the DFIG control to achieve wind power conversion. Here, a maximum power control strategy is incorporated with the DFIG, whereby the produced power serves as the active power reference for the DFIG. Stator flux oriented vector control is applied to decouple the control of active and reactive power generated by the DFIG based wind turbine. A DC/DC boost converter is used for DFIG system to DC grid connection. This system represents transferring offshore wind power to the terrestrial ac grid through the High Voltage DC (HVDC) network. The details of the control strategy and system simulation results in Simulink are presented in the paper. Â© 2015 IEEE.

TI  - Ocean acidification and marine aquaculture in North America: potential impacts and mitigation strategies
JO  - Reviews In Aquaculture
PY  - 2017
VL  - 9
IS  - 4
AB  - Shifting environmental conditions resulting from anthropogenic climate change have recently garnered much attention in the aquaculture industry; however, ocean acidification has received relatively little attention. Here, we provide an overview of ocean acidification in the context of North American aquaculture with respect to potential impacts and mitigation strategies. North American shellfish farms should make ocean acidification an immediate priority, as shellfish and other calcifying organisms are of highest concern in an increasingly acidifying ocean and negative effects have already been felt on the Pacific coast. While implications for various finfish have been documented, our current understanding of how acidification will impact North American finfish aquaculture is limited and requires more research. Although likely to benefit from increases in seawater CO2, some seaweeds may also be at risk under more acidic conditions, particularly calcifying species, as well as non-calcifying ones residing in areas where CO2 is not the primary driver of acidification. Strategies to mitigate and adapt to the effects of acidification exist on the regional scale and can aid in identifying areas of concern, detecting changes in seawater carbonate chemistry early enough to avoid catastrophic outcomes, and adapting to long-term shifts in oceanic pH. Ultimately, ocean acidification has already imposed negative impacts on the aquaculture industry, but can be addressed with sufficient monitoring and the establishment of regional mitigation plans.

JO  - Mediterranean Marine Science
PY  - 2018
VL  - 19
IS  - 2
AB  - Naturally occurring microbial decomposition of organic matter (OM) in coastal marine environments cause increased acidity in deeper layers similar or even exceeding the future predictions for global ocean acidification (OA). Experimental studies in coastal areas characterized by increased inputs of OM and nutrients, coping with intermittent hypoxic/anoxic conditions, provide better understanding of the mechanisms affecting nutrients and carbon biogeochemistry under the emerging effects of coastal pH decrease. Laboratory CO2-manipulated microcosm experiments were conducted using seawater and surface sediment collected from the deepest part of Elefsis Bay (Saronikos Gulf, Eastern Mediterranean) focusing to study the co-evolution of processes affected by the decline of dissolved oxygen and pH induced by (a) OM remineralization and (b) the future anthropogenic increase of atmospheric CO2. Under more acidified conditions, a significant increase of total alkalinity was observed partially attributed to the sedimentary carbonate dissolution and the reactive nitrogen species shift towards ammonium. Nitrate and nitrite decline, in parallel with ammonium increase, demonstrated a deceleration of ammonium oxidation processes along with decrease in nitrate production. The decreased DIN:DIP ratio, the prevalence of organic nutrient species against the inorganic ones, the observations of constrained DON degradation and nitrate production decline and the higher DOC concentrations revealed the possible inhibition of OM decomposition under lower pH values. Finally, our results highlight the need for detailed studies of the carbonate system in coastal areas dominated by hypoxic/anoxic conditions, accompanied by other biogeochemical parameters and properly designed experiments to elucidate the processes sequence or alterations due to pH reduction.

AB  - The maritime industry is in a mind-set to save fuel and reduce emissions. How one achieves this end, however, can be a matter of some debate. Although substantial industry effort is being placed on things that can be optimized, to achieve real benefit and financial return one must first understand the details about how the vessel consumes propulsive energy during its mission. This article discusses a rational, simple, and effective systems engineering approach to identify power and fuel demands via computational propulsion analysis of the individual operating modes of a vessel's duty cycle. It explains sensible consumption metrics that can be used to evaluate and compare different physical systems, strategic plans, or helm decisions. A duty cycle operating mode analysis calculation for a tugboat in multirole service (as a harbor tug and in long haul ocean barge towing) is demonstrated using commercial off-the-shelf software, including examples of design-side and shipboard decision options and consequences.

AB  - Oscillating water column (OWC) systems are water power generation plants that transform wave kinetic energy into electrical energy by a surrounded air column in a chamber that changes its pressure through the waves motion. The chamber pressure output spins a Wells turbine that is linked to a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG), flexible devices that adjust the turbine speed to increase the efficiency. However, there are different nonlinearities associated with these systems such as weather conditions, uncertainties, and turbine stalling phenomenon. In this research, a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) combined with an airflow reference generator (ARG) was designed and validated in a simulation environment to display the efficiency enhancement of an OWC system by the regulation of the turbine speed. Results show that the proposed framework not only increased the system output power, but the stalling is also avoided under different pressure profiles.

TI  - Gas seeps and gas hydrates in the Amazon deep-sea fan
JO  - Geo-marine Letters
PY  - 2018
VL  - 38
IS  - 5
AB  - Deep-sea fans have been proposed to act as carbon sinks, rapid deposition driving shallow methanogenesis to favor net storage within the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ). Here, we present new evidence of widespread gas venting from the GHSZ on the upper Amazon deep-sea fan, together with analyses of the first samples of gas hydrates recovered offshore NE Brazil. Multibeam water column and seafloor imagery over an 18,000-km(2) area of the upper Amazon fan reveal 53 water column gas plumes, rising from venting features in water depths of 650-2600 m. Most gas vents (60\%) are located along seafloor faults that record the ongoing gravitational collapse of the fan above deep d,collements, while others (40\%) are located in water depths of 650-715 m within the upper edge of the GHSZ. Gas compositions from hydrates recovered in vents at three locations on and north of the fan indicate biogenic sources (dominantly methane with 2-15\% of CO2; delta C-13 from - 81.1 to - 77.3aEuro degrees), whereas samples from vents adjacent to the fan proper include possible thermogenic contributions (methane 95\%, CO2 4\%, and ethane 1\%; delta C-13 - 59.2aEuro degrees). These results concur with previous findings that the upper edge of the GHSZ may be sensitive to temporal changes in water temperatures, but further point to the importance of gas escape from within areas of gas hydrate stability. Our results suggest the role of fluid migration along pathways created by faulting within rapidly deposited passive margin depocenters, which are increasingly recognized to undergo gravitational collapse above d,collements. Our findings add to evidence that gas can escape from sediments to the sea in areas where gas hydrates are stable on passive margins, and suggest the need of further studies of the dynamics of deep-sea depocenters in relation to carbon cycling.

TI  - Addition of carbon sorbents to reduce PCB and PAH bioavailability in marine sediments: Physicochemical tests
JO  - Environmental Science And Technology
PY  - 2004
VL  - 38
IS  - 20
AB  - The addition of activated carbon as particulate sorbent to the biologically active layer of contaminated sediment is proposed as an in-situ treatment method to reduce the chemical and biological availability of hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We report results from physicochemical experiments that assess this concept. PCB- and PAH-contaminated sediment from Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, San Francisco Bay, CA, was contacted with coke and activated carbon for periods of 1 and 6 months. Sediment treated with 3.4 wt % activated carbon showed 92% and 84% reductions in aqueous equilibrium PCB and PAH concentrations, 77% and 83% reductions in PCB and PAH uptake by semipermeable membrane devices (SPMD), respectively, and reductions in PCB flux to overlying water in quiescent systems up to 89%. Adding coke to contaminated sediment did not significantly decrease aqueous equilibrium PCB concentrations nor PCB or PAH availability in SPMD measurements. Coke decreased PAH aqueous equilibrium concentrations by 38-64% depending on coke dose and particle size. The greater effectiveness of activated carbon as compared to coke is attributed to its much greater specific surface area and a pore structure favorable for binding contaminants. The results from the physicochemical tests suggest that adding activated carbon to contaminated field sediment reduces HOC availability to the aqueous phase. The benefit is manifested relatively quickly under optimum contact conditions and improves in effectiveness with contact time from 1 to 6 months. Activated carbon application is a potentially attractive method for in-situ, nonremoval treatment of marine sediment contaminated with HOCs.

JO  - Renewable \& Sustainable Energy Reviews
PY  - 2020
VL  - 131
IS  - NA
AB  - In order to comply with stringent environmental regulations, shipbuilders and ship-owners are seeking cleaner fuels and the integration of renewable energy sources into ship power systems. Such solutions regularly result in additional costs for ship operators, both in the case of retrofitting existing ships or acquiring completely new vessels. This paper deals with the life-cycle cost assessments (LCCAs) of different power system configurations of a ro-ro passenger vessel operating in the Croatian short-sea shipping sector. Electrification of the ship is considered as an option to reduce the carbon footprint (CF) of the vessel and to achieve economic savings during its lifetime. In this sense, the ship operational profile is analysed and its total power needs are determined. The life-cycle assessments of an existing diesel engine-powered solution and two potential battery-powered ship options (with and without photovoltaic cells) are performed by means of GREET 2018 software. Furthermore, these options are compared from an economical viewpoint, where different carbon credit scenarios are investigated. The results show that a diesel engine-powered vessel has the highest carbon footprint, as expected. However, it is also found that a battery-powered vessel (with or without photovoltaic cells) has a minimum environmental footprint and at the same time represents economically the most favourable solution for all possible carbon allowance scenarios. This indicates that all-electric ships seem to be a promising option for the future development of the Croatian short-sea shipping sector.

TI  - Speed models for energy-efficient maritime transportation: A taxonomy and survey
JO  - Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies
PY  - 2013
VL  - 26
IS  - NA
AB  - International shipping accounts for 2.7% of worldwide CO2 emissions, and measures to curb future emissions growth are sought with a high sense of urgency. With the increased quest for greener shipping, reducing the speed of ships has obtained an increased role as one of the measures to be applied toward that end. Already speed has been important for economic reasons, as it is a key determinant of fuel cost, a significant component of the operating cost of ships. Moreover, speed is an important parameter of the overall logistical operation of a shipping company and of the overall supply chain and may directly or indirectly impact fleet size, ship size, cargo inventory costs and shippers' balance sheets. Changes in ship speed may also induce modal shifts, if cargo can choose other modes because they are faster. However, as emissions are directly proportional to fuel consumed, speed is also very much connected with the environmental dimension of shipping. So when shipping markets are in a depressed state and " slow-steaming" is the prevalent practice for economic reasons, an important side benefit is reduced emissions. In fact there are many indications that this practice, very much applied these days, will be the norm in the future. This paper presents a survey of speed models in maritime transportation, that is, models in which speed is one of the decision variables. A taxonomy of such models is also presented, according to a set of parameters. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is difficult for these converters to operate in higher dc bus voltage due to the switching transients, large voltage stress on each switches and large losses. Therefore, Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) has been gaining popularity over these converters in the field of high voltage and high power applications such as HVDC. In this paper, control of MMC based multiterminal HVDC transmission system for offshore wind energy integration and subsea oil and gas application are presented. Different strategies to regulate the DC link voltage, active and reactive power flow and AC grid voltage of the passive subsea grid in a 3-terminal offshore HVDC grid have been presented.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In situ sorbent amendment for persistent organic pollutant sequestration in sediment has over the past 15 years steadily progressed from bench-scale trials to full-scale remediation applications. Hindering a wider technology uptake are, however, concerns about ecotoxic side-effects of the most commonly used sorbent, activated carbon, on sensitive, sediment dwelling organisms like Lumbriculus variegatus. Using River Tyne sediment polluted with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and L. variegatus as a case study, sorbent alternatives and magnetic sorbent-recovery were investigated as potential engineering strategies to mitigate such ecotoxic side-effects. The potential benefits of contacting the treated sediment with fresh River Tyne water, as would naturally occur over time in the intended applications, were studied. RESULTS: Magnetic biochar was identified as an effective PAH sorbent with less ecotoxic side-effects than magnetic activated carbon. After 85.1-100\% magnetic recovery of this biochar, no ecotoxic side-effects on L. variegatus were measurable in the treated sediment. Results show that ecotoxic effects of magnetic activated carbon can be alleviated through sorbent recovery. In contrast, contacting treated sediment repeatedly with River Tyne water had no measurable benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic biochar is a promising sorbent material for the remediation of PAH polluted sediment. (c) 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Accurate forecasts of ocean waves energy can not only reduce costs for investment, but it is also essential for the management and operation of electrical power. This paper presents an innovative approach based on long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the power generation of an economical wave energy converter named ``Searaser{''}. The data for analysis is provided by collecting the experimental data from another study and the exerted data from a numerical simulation of Searaser. The simulation is performed with Flow-3D software, which has high capability in analyzing fluid-solid interactions. The lack of relation between wind speed and output power in previous studies needs to be investigated in this field. Therefore, in this study, wind speed and output power are related with an LSTM method. Moreover, it can be inferred that the LSTM network is able to predict power in terms of height more accurately and faster than the numerical solution in a field of predicting. The network output figures show a great agreement, and the root mean square is 0.49 in the mean value related to the accuracy of the LSTM method. Furthermore, the mathematical relation between the generated power and wave height was introduced by curve fitting of the power function to the result of the LSTM method.

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - To meet the reduction targets of greenhouse gas emissions by highly polluting vessels such as cruise ships, several strategies are possible: the introduction of new fuels (i.e. LNG, hydrogen and biofuel), the installation of more efficient engines, the electrification of the propulsion systems, the lightening of the structures, the energy efficiency improvement of the auxiliary services (i.e. air conditioning). In particular, vessels weight reduction can be achieved by introducing new materials. The aim of this work was to manufacture an innovative laminate, which comes from the combination of a cork layer and an aluminium honeycomb sandwich, intended to provide an eco-friendly and lightweight solution for structures potentially destined to marine applications, such as ship decks, hulls or cabins' construction. The suggested solution is expected to combine several functions and properties, such as low density and thermal and acoustic insulation - which potentially influence propulsion and auxiliaries fuel consumption-as well as good mechanical performances. The investigation was particularly focused on the potentialities offered by the cork layer, traditionally addressed at insulation purposes, in supporting and enhancing the impact-absorption capabilities of the aluminium honeycomb structure, especially in view of the potential marine applications which often suffer from low-velocity impact events. Having a dual function: (i) to lighten the superstructures and (ii) to promote the thermal and acoustic insulation, by thus influencing, respectively, propulsion and auxiliaries fuel consumption. For instance, the suggested solution could be used for cabins' construction. In the present work, the energy absorption capabilities of the new lightweight structure were evaluated by means of low-velocity impact tests. An excellent response, comparable to that of double-layer aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels, was observed, suggesting that the new structure is a promising and sustainable alternative for marine constructions.

AB  - Monopiles for offshore wind are the most used foundations by farm operators due to their low production costs, when compared to other bottom-fixed or floating foundations. In this research, a monopile foundation for offshore wind power was evaluated for its soil interaction and grout behavior, and an appropriate numerical model for the structural analysis of the foundation and tower was developed. FAST 8, an aero-hydro-servo-elastic numerical code developed by NREL, was used to obtain the loads applied on the supporting structures. These loads were pre-processed before they were inputted on the finite element model, developed using the finite element software ANSYS. The considered conical grout connection, which connects the monopile to the transition piece through friction, was modeled under a changing-status nonlinearity condition. To model the soil-pile interaction, a p-y model was applied using the ANSYS APDL commands. Static, modal, and transient structural analyses were produced to study the structure suitability for its use on offshore environments. Different soil interactions were modeled, and their results were then compared within the transient and modal analysis, indicating that the angle of the grout connection strongly affects the loading conditions on the grout. Moreover, scouring affects the dynamic behavior of the overall supporting structures, thus protection against this phenomenon is suggested.

AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) strategy reduces ship emission to 2020 and zero in 2050, the ship-owners and ship operators are looking for economic solutions to meet the new emission requirements. The available solutions include using Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) or sulphur-free-fuel, switching form high sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) to marine gas oil or distillate fuels, using very-low-sulphur fuel oil or compliant fuel blends and using scrubber/exhaust gas cleaning system on the ship, which allows operation on regular HSFO. The cost of changing and using fuel may be too high as a barrier for Vietnamese ship-owner. Therefore, advantages and disadvantages of available options need to analysis. In this article, the pros and cons of available options were analysed by using thematic PLEET analysis that considering political, legal, economic, environmental, technological and sociological aspects. The results show that using compliant blended fuel is a priority solution for the most Vietnamese commercial ship-owners as well as using LNG fuel will be a solution for building new ships. It is expected that this research would make any contribution to improving the efficiency of commercial ships to satisfy the IMOâ€™s strategy. Â© 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Maritime transport is one of the largest greenhouse gas emitting sectors of the global economy, responsible for around 1 GtCO2eq every year. To comply with the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, the research is devoted introducing low and zero-carbon fuels and innovative propulsion technologies. In this context, hydrogen fuel cell powertrains can play a crucial role due to their high energy and environmental performances. In this paper, a techno-economic feasibility analysis for replacing an 8.3 MW diesel engine with a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell system is performed for a chemical tanker ship. For this purpose, a detailed method, that aims to estimate the volume and mass of the fuel cell system as well as of the hydrogen storage technologies, is developed. Three on board hydrogen storage technologies are considered: i) compressed hydrogen, ii) liquid hydrogen, iii) metal hydrides. Results highlight that the fuel cell-based powertrain is characterized by 60% less volume and 56% less mass compared to the diesel engine. As far as the hydrogen storage technologies are concerned, all solutions present significantly lower volumetric and gravimetric energy densities and therefore, additional volume and mass are required in comparison with diesel fuel configuration. These results involve a reduction of the total cargo capacity to comply with tanker ship physical constraints. The cargo should be reduced by 1.3%-1.1% for compressed hydrogen (at 350 bar and 700 bar, respectively), 0.1% for liquid hydrogen, and 9% for metal hydrides. Finally, the economic assessment in terms of Operational Expenditures, based upon the predicted hydrogen price reduction as well as the diesel price increase, in different cost scenarios (2020â€“2050), are evaluated. Results show that the competitiveness of the hydrogen solution with a retail price of 4 $/kg can be achieved by considering an incentive for the avoided CO2 equal to 112 $/tons. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Decarbonizing Maritime Transport: The Importance of Engine Technology and Regulations for LNG to Serve as a Transition Fuel
JO  - Sustainability
PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 21
AB  - Current Greenhous gas emissions (GHG) from maritime transport represent around 3\% of global anthropogenic GHG emissions and will have to be cut in half by 2050 to meet Paris agreement goals. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is by many seen as a potential transition fuel for decarbonizing shipping. Its favorable hydrogen to carbon ratio compared to diesel (marine gas oil, MGO) or bunker fuel (heavy fuel oil, HFO) translates directly into lower carbon emissions per kilowatt produced. However, these gains may be nullified once one includes the higher Well-to-tank emissions (WTT) of the LNG supply chain and the vessel's un-combusted methane slip (CH4) from its combustion engine. Previous studies have tended to focus either on greenhouse gas emissions from LNG in a Well-to-wake (WTW) perspective, or on alternative engine technologies and their impact on the vessel's Tank-to-wake emissions (TTW). This study investigates under what conditions LNG can serve as a transition fuel in the decarbonization of maritime transport, while ensuring the lowest possible additional global warming impact. Transition refers to the process of moving away from fossil fuels towards new and low carbon fuels and engine technologies. Our results show: First, the importance of applying appropriate engine technologies to maximize GHG reductions; Second, that applying best engine technologies is not economically profitable; Third, how regulations could be amended to reward best engine technologies. Importantly, while the GHG reduction of LNG even with best engine technology (dual fuel diesel engine) are limited, ships with these engines can with economically modest modification switch to ammonia produced with renewable energy when it becomes available in sufficient amounts.

TI  - An approach for evaluating the stochastic behaviour of wave energy converters
JO  - Applied Ocean Research
PY  - 2022
VL  - 129
IS  - NA
AB  - Due to their random nature, obtaining reliable models that can describe the behaviour of waves is far from simple. This paper presents an approach for forecasting the capabilities of wave energy converters (WECs) for two points, one of them located offshore and the other nearshore. Bivariate Weibull distributions were fitted from spectral significant wave height and mean peak period data. Then, models relating the parameters of these distributions to the day of the year were obtained using mixture density networks, which give the distribution of the predicted variables instead of their expected value. Energy conversion capabilities were forecasted by generating a set of random values for the bivariate Weibull coefficients from the modelled distributions for the period in question. Predicted cumulative distributions for spectral significant wave heights and mean peak periods were then combined with the matrix of the converter in question, allowing the corresponding energy conversion capability to be computed. The proposed method was validated by considering data from the last three years, which were not used to train the models. The resulting predictions were consistent not only with the expected seasonal behaviour, but also with the expected differences between the offshore and nearshore points. It should be also noted that all the validation energy values fall into the forecasted 95% confidence intervals, showing the effectiveness of the approach. Â© 2022 The Author(s)

TI  - INTERNATIONAL TREATIES AND US LAWS AS TOOLS TO REGULATE THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM SHIPS AND PORTS
JO  - NANA
PY  - 2013
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Regulations on greenhouse gas emissions within the maritime sector are possible, and some are in progress, using the tools of both international treaty law and federal regulations. Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC), port and coastal States have jurisdiction over all ships entering their waters and thus have the unique ability to put efficient mitigation strategies in place, ranging from the inexpensive mandatory reduction in vessel speed to the more expensive commitment of installing shore-side electricity or scrubbing/sequestration equipment. These efforts should be financially supported by federal grants to avoid the race to the bottom. On a more global scale, LOSC Article 213 may contain greenhouse gas emissions within its definition of pollution. Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships of 1973 (MARPOL) is more directly on point for pollution control and is thus the more viable mechanism. Under MARPOL Annex VI, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has made progress towards determining the feasibility of multiple technological, operational, and market-based approaches to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, including reforms in design, fuel, and operation. Despite this progress, the IMO must now take action and incorporate these approaches into MARPOL Annex VI to allow party nations to enforce them within their waters. Alternatively, the implementation of these approaches may be forced by a global cap-and-trade scheme resulting from the negotiations conducted under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Assigning these emissions to the flag State as a form of punishment for its cooperation in helping its flagged vessels avoid current regulation is suggested; however, creating a virtual country for the marine shipping industry is the more politically attractive option. On a federal front, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has made progress in tightening the the regulations in section 213 of the Clean Air Act (CA) governing marine vessels. These improvements, combined with the recent success of the designation of U. S. waters as a SOx Emission Control Area, will have substantial health and climate change-related benefits. However, carbon dioxide emissions for marine vessels remain unregulated, as well as, for the most part, category 1 and 2 engines. The EPA needs to continue to promulgate additional standards under CA section 213 to fill in these gaps.

TI  - Carbon dioxide storage in deltaic saline aquifers: Invasion percolation and compositional simulation
JO  - Spe Reservoir Evaluation And Engineering
PY  - 2021
VL  - 24
IS  - 3
AB  - Storage of large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) within deep underground aquifers has great potential for long-term mitigation of climate change. The U.S. Gulf Coast is an attractive target for CO2 storage because of the favorable formation properties for injection and containment of CO2. Deltaic formations are one of the primary targeted depositional environments in the Gulf Coast. In this paper, we investigate CO2 storage in deltaic saline aquifers through a combination of geological modeling and flow simulation. The approach presented in this paper based on a combination of invasion percolation and compositional reservoir simulation focuses on buoyancy-dominant flow of CO2 in the long term and its pressure-driven flow in the short term. The results provide insights into how to screen and identify prospective locations for CO2 storage and determine the underlying geological features controlling CO2 migration for a basin-scale study. The geological model in our study is developed based on a laboratory-scale three-dimensional (3D) flume experiment replicating the formation of a delta structure and populated with geologic properties according to Miocene Gulf of Mexico natural analogues. We used invasion percolation simulations to understand the buoyancy-driven flow and the relationship between architecture, stratigraphy, and fluid migration pathways. The results were used to develop an upscaled model for compositional simulation with the key features of the original geological model and to determine injection schemes that maximize the injection capacity and minimize the amount of mobile CO2 in the formation. To achieve this, we used compositional reservoir simulations to study the pressure-driven flow and phase behavior. The results of invasion percolation simulations were used to identify the key stratigraphic units affecting CO2 migration. The realistic geometries and high resolution of the model facilitate the transfer of results from synthetic to subsurface data. The results allow for the analysis of deltaic depositional environments, important stratigraphic surfaces, and their impact on CO2 storage. The reservoir simulation model and phase behavior were validated against available field and laboratory data. The results of reservoir simulations were used to investigate the effects of main mechanisms, such as gas trapping and solubilization, on storage capacity. We compared our simulation results based on invasion percolation (buoyancy driven) and reservoir simulation (pressure driven). The comparison is helpful to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and determine best practices to evaluate CO2 migration within similar formations. The unique and extremely well-characterized deltaic model allows for unprecedented representation of the depositional aquifer architecture. This research combines geologic modeling, flow simulation, and application for CO2 storage. The integrated conclusions will constrain predictions of actual subsurface flow performance and CO2 storage capacity in deltaic systems while identifying potential risks and primary stratigraphic migration pathways. This research provides insights on prediction of CO2 storage performance and characterization of prospective saline aquifers. Copyright Â© 2021 Society of Petroleum Engineers

AB  - Offshore wind power generation has traditionally been reserved for shallow-water locations as wind farm technology has, to date, concentrated on seabed fixed platforms. The requirements for inshore and offshore wind turbines are quite different requiring alternative technology to enable the effective utilization of wind power in all environments. The construction of the Hywind floating wind turbine is based on a proven deepwater floating platform design. This comprises a tall cylinder; containing flotation tanks partly submerged 100 meters below the surface. Hywind is currently moored in 220 meters of water with in excess of 100 meters of power cable weighing about a ton per ten meters. The cable must be able to accommodate all movement and loading from the ocean in relation to the static platform, as well as its own weight, and therefore has a different performance specification from the cable used in static shallow-water wind farms.

AB  - There has been increasing focus on conserving coastal ecosystems as they have been recognized as high ecosystem carbon stocks and are in the process of land conversion. The present study aims to examine how different vegetation covers impact the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock in coastal sabkhas. To this end, the study was carried out at ten sampling sites represent ten sabkhas in Saudi Arabia's southern Red Sea coast for two main goals: (1) to examine the vertical distribution of SOC content, SOC density, and the soil bulk density (SBD) based on different vegetation covers, and (2) to assess these locations' SOC stocks. This study posits that sabkhas with different vegetation covers had distinct parameters specified above. Significant SBD differences were observed in sabkhas with different vegetation covers, with the lowest mean values of sabkhas having >75-100\% vegetation cover and the highest mean values of sabkhas having 0-25\% vegetation cover. The studied sabkhas also showed significant difference in the total means of SOC density, SOC content, and SOC stock in terms of different vegetation covers, with the highest mean values of sabkhas having >75-100\% vegetation cover and the lowest mean of sabkhas having 0-25\% vegetation cover. The present study is the first to focus on Saudi Arabia's sabkha blue carbon stocks and its results can help add to the literature on sabkhas carbon stock, thus aiding relevant government agencies working towards sabkhas management, encouraging public awareness regarding sabkhas conservation stocks, and their part in climate change mitigation.

AB  - Marine environment is facing a great challenge from rapid population growth and increased human activities. The uncontrolled discharge of wastewater and ballast water has caused the growth of harmful bacteria and algal blooms. Here we report a self-powered electrochemical water treatment system for sterilization and algae removal in wastewater using the newly invented triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) that provides the power from the water wave. A synergetic effect of both free chlorine and reduced graphene oxide during the electrolysis process resulted in an effective impact to bactericidals and high-efficiency algae removal. This system achieves more than 6 log (99.9999\%) removal of three model bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis and Vibrio alginolyticus, and high removal efficiencies for mixed marine algae. Our study demonstrates an innovative and unique approach toward a totally self-powered electrochemical water treatment system for bacterial inactivation and algae removal without supplying additional power. This is a step toward self-powered environmental electrochemistry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Victorian Carbon Dioxide Geological Storage Options; an engineering evaluation of storage potential in southeastern Australia
JO  - NANA
PY  - 2011
VL  - 4
IS  - NA
AB  - In a carbon constrained environment, the ongoing utilisation of southeastern Australia's extensive brown coal reserves, largely contained within Victoria's Latrobe Valley, will require substantial mitigation of the related greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon Dioxide Capture and (geological) Storage (CCS) has been selected as a potential emissions mitigation technology for this region. Three basins were short-listed as potential injection sites within Victoria: the Gippsland Basin (both onshore and offshore); the offshore Bass Basin; and the offshore Torquay Sub-Basin. These sites were taken through a provisional subsurface engineering evaluation, which allowed an evaluation of the likely viability of large-scale CO2 storage within the three basins, the security of CO2 containment, achievable injectivity and capacity. The work presented here was premised on CO2 injection commencing in 2015, at an initial injection rate of 5 MT annually, increasing to 20 MT annually by 2020. The southern flank of the Gippsland Basin (offshore) ranks highest in terms of estimated accessiblity and storage capacity, with over 700 MT of CO2 storage available, characterised by saline aquifer trapping. The storage capacity of the Bass Basin is estimated to be over 400 MT, available within structural traps. The onshore Gippsland Basin and the Torquay Sub-Basin are ranked as the least suitable for the long-term storage of CO2, due to uncertainties associated with injectivity and containment, together with relatively small estimated storage capacities (<100 MT). The current study illustrates that significant potential for storage exists in both Victoria's offshore Gippsland Basin and the Bass Basin. Although indicative costs are large the region provides an ideal platform from which large-scale CO2 storage projects of global importance may be undertaken. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We present a real options approach to evaluate technology and capacity choices under regulatory uncertainty. Our two-phase, regime-switching model includes the option of investing in different technologies as well as a charter and layup option, respectively. For a base-case version of this model, we derive an analytical solution before studying the effect of regulatory uncertainty in a numerical extension that relaxes certain restrictive assumptions. We then describe three regulatory regimes, an emissions cap, an emissions tax and a cap-and-trade market, and compare how effectively each reduces emissions. Applying the model to maritime container shipping, we develop insights on the optimal technology choice for reducing SOx emissions. We find that regulatory uncertainty can increase not only project values but also owned capacity. From a regulatory perspective, an emissions cap reduces emissions more effectively whereas an emissions tax reduces the cost of regulation. The cap-and-trade market emerges in many respects as superior to an emissions tax. Finally, we show that setting the emissions cap level-or deciding on the level above which an emissions tax or emissions trade apply-is critical because reduction in total industry emissions are not necessarily continuous.

TI  - Machine Learning Techniques for Renewable Energy Forecasting: A Comprehensive Review
JO  - Green Energy And Technology
PY  - 2022
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Over the past decade, renewable energy resources, such as wind, solar, biomass, ocean energy and other kinds of energy, are becoming attractive technologies for building green smart cities. These new forms of energy can complete the worldâ€™s energy demand, protect the environment and provide energy security. Statistics have shown that renewable energy resources offer between 15 and 30% of the worldâ€™s energy. Moreover, the production and consumption of different kinds of renewable energy are constantly increasing every year. However, forecasting renewable resources in terms of production and consumption is becoming more vital for the decision-making process in the energy sector. Indeed, the accurate forecasting of renewable energy permits to ensure optimal management of energy. In this context, machine learning techniques represent a promising solution to deal with forecasting issues. Several solutions and forecasting models based on machine learning have been extensively proposed in the literature for predicting power energy that should be deployed for future smart cities. This chapter aims to conduct a systematic mapping study to analyze and synthesize studies concerning machine learning techniques for forecasting renewable resources. Therefore, a total number of 86 relevant papers published on this subject between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2021, were carefully selected. The selected articles were classified and analyzed according to the following criteria: channel and year of publication, research type, study domain, study context, study category and machine learning techniques used for forecasting renewable resources. The results showed that wind energy and solar energy were used massively in selected papers, and the forecasting of power production based on hourly forecast model and minutely forecast was the primary interest in the majority of selected papers. Furthermore, artificial neural network (ANN) and deep neural network (DNN) were the most regression algorithms used to predict renewable energy sources.

PY  - 2011
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Increasing interest in marine hydrokinetic (MHK) energy has led to significant research regarding optimal placement of emerging technologies to maximize energy capture and minimize effects on the marine environment. Understanding the changes to the near-and far-field hydrodynamics is necessary to assess optimal placement. MHK projects will convert energy (momentum) from the system, altering water velocities and potentially water quality and sediment transport as well. Maximum site efficiency for MHK power projects must balance with the requirement of avoiding environmental harm. This study is based on previous modification to an existing flow, sediment dynamics, and water-quality code (SNL-EFDC) where a simulation of an experimental flume is used to qualify, quantify, and visualize the influence of MHK energy generation. Turbulence and device parameters are calibrated against wake data from a flume experiment out of the University of Southampton (L. Myers and A. S. Bahaj, Near wake properties of horizontal axis marine current turbines, in Proceedings of the 8 th European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference, 2009, pp. 558-565) to produce verified simulations of MHK-device energy removal. To achieve a realistic velocity deficit within the wake of the device, parametric studies using the nonlinear, model-independent, parameter estimators PEST and DAKOTA were compared to determine parameter sensitivities and optimal values for various constants in the flow and turbulence closure equations. The sensitivity analyses revealed that the Smagorinski subgrid-scale horizontal momentum diffusion constant and the k-Îµ kinetic energy dissipation rate constant (CÎµ4) were the two most important parameters influencing wake profile and dissipation at 10 or more device diameters downstream as they strongly influence how the wake mixes with the bulk flow. These results verify the model, which can now be used to perform MHK-array distribution and optimization studies. Â© 2011 MTS.

PY  - 1997
VL  - 21
IS  - 3
AB  - Measurements of loads, wind climate and turbulence, power and other parameters have been conducted for several years on the 5MW Vindeby Offshore Wind Farm. The wind farm is located 2-3 km off the coast of one of the Danish islands in the south of the Baltic Sea and consists of 11 wind turbines each of 450 kW, arranged in two rows with 5 and 6 machines, respectively. Online measurements of fatigue loading (rain-flow counting) have been gathered resulting in approx. 13,000 sets of valid 1/2 hour statistics (mean, standard deviation, maximum and minimum); in the case of fatigue the concept of equivalent load has been applied to store results in a compact format. The good data quality and the (obvious) homogeneous terrain surface (water) facilitate detailed analyses of both pure offshore effects and the combined effect of being offshore and having increased loads due to wake effects. Thus, in the paper extreme loads and fatigue loads are analyzed and compared to loads onshore. The results may possibly be applied when re-designing wind turbines from inland climate to the climate of offshore locations in identical climate regions. The work was co financed by the European Union under contract JOU2-CT93-0350.

AB  - Airfoil is a key factor that influences the hydrodynamic performance of vertical axis tidal current energy turbine. In order to explore the influences from the runner's blade airfoil towards its hydrodynamic performance, three-dimensional unsteady flow numerical simulation on four airfoils of straight blade H type of tidal current energy turbines was carried out, under the precondition of same turbine compactness. Through investigating the influences from the four different airfoils of H blade towards the runner in terms of its dynamic torque feature and hydropower utilization coefficient, this research has analyzed the hydrodynamic performance of the tidal current energy turbine. As the research result indicates, the maximum dynamic torque value of the single-blade turbine with NACA0015 airfoil is significantly higher than that of the other three airfoils; while the maximum value of the overall runner torque is determined by the operating conditions such as different stream speed etc. As a whole, hydropower utilization coefficient of the turbine with asymmetric airfoil NACA4415 is better than that of the other three airfoils. This research has provided references for the design and airfoil selection for the new type of tidal current energy turbine.

AB  - WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤ Corporation has developed the world's most powerful engine, 14-cylinder RT-flex96C, for a large, fast container vessel, which entered into service on September 1, 2006. The low-speed engine is based on an already well-established 12-cylinder RT-flex96C design, which was developed from the RTA96C engine type widely applied in container ships since 1998. It provides unparalleled flexibility in the way the engines operates, resulting in smokeless operation at all operating speeds, lower fuel consumption, reduced maintenance costs, and lower steady operating speeds for better maneuvering. An important feature of the engine is the high-efficiency waste heat recovery system, which provides major savings in fuel consumption and reductions in exhaust gas emissions. The engine also extends the power available to suit the new generation of large containerships, with the complete flexibility of RT-flex common-rail technology.

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Traditionally seagoing vessels have been designed and optimized to operate at maximum economic speeds based on hydrodynamic considerations. More recently, high fuel prices and increased environmental concerns have challenged this practice. In combination with the introduction of stricter energy efficiency requirements, this makes design improvement a necessity for all new bulk vessels. This is in contradiction to traditional bulk vessel designs, where the focus has been on maximizing the cargo-carrying capacity at the lowest possible building cost, and not on reducing the energy consumption. Moreover, historically the Panama Canal has been an important design criterion, while the new canal locks from 2014 will significantly increase the maximum size of vessels that can sail through the canal. This expansion will enable cost and emission reductions through employing larger vessels or by more cost and energy efficient designs being introduced. The present paper provides an assessment of what can be achieved by employing larger bulk vessels and by introducing more energy efficient designs with focus on a vesselâ€™s beam, length and hull slenderness expressed by the length displacement ratio.

JO  - Mechanical Systems And Signal Processing
PY  - 2013
VL  - 40
IS  - 1
AB  - The test field alpha ventus is the first operating German offshore parks for wind energy. Twelve Wind Energy Converters (WECs) of the 5 MW-class are installed, both, for commercial and research reasons. Due to upcoming mass production and uncertainties in loads and behaviour, monitoring the foundation of these structures was desired. Two goals addressed are the extraction of modal parameters for model validation and the estimation of condition parameters to allow a hypothesis of the system's state. In a first step the largedatabase is classified by Environmental and Operational Conditions (EOCs) through affinity propagation which is a new approach for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) on wind turbines. Further, system identification through data driven stochastic subspace identification (SSI) is performed. A new, automated approach called triangulation-based extraction of modal parapeters (TEMP), using stability diagrams, is a key focus of the presented research. Finally, extraction of condition parameters for tower accelerations classified by EOCs, based on covariance driven SSI and Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) Models, is performed for several observation periods from one to 16 weeks. These parameters and their distributions provide a base line for long term observations. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

JO  - Deep-sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers
PY  - 2003
VL  - 50
IS  - 8
AB  - We present inorganic carbon data from the coastal upwelling region west of Vancouver Island, Canada (âˆ¼48.5Â°N, 126Â°W) directly after an upwelling event and during summer downwelling in July 1998. The inner-shelf buoyancy current, the outer-shelf and the slope regions are contrasted for both wind regimes (up- and downwelling). Results show strong biological drawdown of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) in response to upwelling over the outer-shelf. In contrast, measured pCO2 is exceptionally high (pCO2 &gt; 1000 ppm) in the inner-shelf current, where biological uptake of carbon is consistently large. The biological C:N uptake ratio appears to increase when nitrogen becomes limiting (during downwelling), while the POC:PON ratio is relatively constant (slightly lower than the Redfield ratio) suggesting that excess carbon uptake does not go into the POC pool. As expected, large cells dominate where measured primary productivity is greatest. Sub-surface inorganic carbon (and pCO2) is high over the shelf. We suggest that carbon concentrations may be higher in coastal waters because of remineralization associated with high productivity that is confined to a smaller volume of water by bathymetry. At the coast these sub-surface concentrations are more efficiently mixed into the surface (especially during winter) relative to deeper offshore regions. Thus, despite high primary production, coastal waters may not aid in sequestration of atmospheric carbon. Â© 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 54
IS  - NA
AB  - The shipping sector's emissions and energy efficiency are attracting increasing international scrutiny, with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) actively promoting better energy management by implementing mandatory Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plans (SEEMP). Key potential measures to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions are speed optimization and improved communication with charterers and ports to work towards `just in time' operation when there are known delays in port (Virtual Arrival). In this paper we assess empirically, for the first time, the potential reduction in fuel consumption and emissions from the implementation of a Virtual Arrival policy in a global context based on ship position data from the Automated Identification System (AIS). We evaluate 5066 voyages performed by 483 Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) between 44 countries for the period 2013-2015 and estimate the potential for fuel savings if unproductive waiting time at the destination ports can instead be utilized to reduce the average sailing speed. We find that even if only 50\% of the estimated waiting time can be avoided, the consequential slow-down in average sailing speeds leads to an average reduction of 422 tonnes of CO2 and 6.7 tonnes of SOx emissions per voyage. Our findings are important for policy making and the optimization of voyage management in shipping companies as they illustrate the substantial savings on fuel costs and emissions from the broad implementation of Virtual Arrival compared to the prevailing first-come first-served berthing policy and the standard charterparty term of sailing with `utmost dispatch'.

TI  - Nitrate addition stimulates microbial decomposition of organic matter in salt marsh sediments
JO  - Global Change Biology
PY  - 2019
VL  - 25
IS  - 10
AB  - Salt marshes sequester carbon at rates more than an order of magnitude greater than their terrestrial counterparts, helping to mitigate climate change. As nitrogen loading to coastal waters continues, primarily in the form of nitrate, it is unclear what effect it will have on carbon storage capacity of these highly productive systems. This uncertainty is largely driven by the dual role nitrate can play in biological processes, where it can serve as a nutrient-stimulating primary production or a thermodynamically favorable electron acceptor fueling heterotrophic metabolism. Here, we used a controlled flow-through reactor experiment to test the role of nitrate as an electron acceptor, and its effect on organic matter decomposition and the associated microbial community in salt marsh sediments. Organic matter decomposition significantly increased in response to nitrate, even at sediment depths typically considered resistant to decomposition. The use of isotope tracers suggests that this pattern was largely driven by stimulated denitrification. Nitrate addition also significantly altered the microbial community and decreased alpha diversity, selecting for taxa belonging to groups known to reduce nitrate and oxidize more complex forms of organic matter. Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy further supported these results, suggesting that nitrate facilitated decomposition of complex organic matter compounds into more bioavailable forms. Taken together, these results suggest the existence of organic matter pools that only become accessible with nitrate and would otherwise remain stabilized in the sediment. The existence of such pools could have important implications for carbon storage, since greater decomposition rates as N loading increases may result in less overall burial of organic-rich sediment. Given the extent of nitrogen loading along our coastlines, it is imperative that we better understand the resilience of salt marsh systems to nutrient enrichment, especially if we hope to rely on salt marshes, and other blue carbon systems, for long-term carbon storage.

JO  - Advances In Marine And Brackishwater Aquaculture
PY  - 2015
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - This book compiles the latest findings in the field of marine and brackishwater aquaculture. It covers significant topics such as techniques of culture of live feeds (microalgae, rotifer, Artemia, marine copepod & polychaetes), while also highlighting vital themes like the culture and applications of free and marine sponge associated microbial probiotics, controlled breeding, seed production and culture of commercially important fin and shell fishes. Moreover, the book focuses on the breeding and culture of marine ornamental fishes, sea cucumber and sea urchin and discusses seaweeds culture, aqua feed formulation and nutrition, water quality management in hatchery and grow-out culture systems, fish disease diagnosis and health management and cryopreservation of fish gametes for sustainable aquaculture practices, all from a multidimensional perspective. The global fish production was 154 million tonnes in 2011 which more or less consisted of capture and culture fisheries (FAO, 2012). Roughly 80% of this is from inland-freshwater aquaculture and the remainder from capture fisheries in the marine and brackishwater sector. However, marine and brackishwater catches have recently begun to diminish due to overexploitation, climate change and pollution. The UNEP report affirmed that if the world remains on its current course of overfishing, by 2050, the ocean fish stock could become extinct or no longer commercially viable to exploit. In these circumstances, aquaculture is considered to be a promising sector to fulfill our future protein requirement. However, brackishwater and marine fish production now face serious challenges due to e.g. lack of quality fish seeds, feeds, poor water quality management and diseases. Fisheries and aquaculture sectors play a vital role as potential sources of nutritional security and food safety around the globe. Fish food is rich in protein, vitamins, phosphorous, calcium, zinc, selenium etc. In addition, fish contains omega-3 fatty acids, which help to prevent cardiovascular diseases. Fish food can also provide several health benefits to consumers. The omega 3 fatty acids found in fish can reduce the levels of LDL cholesterol (the bad cholesterol) and increase the HDL levels (the good cholesterol). Research conducted in Australia has proved that fish consumption can be used to cure hypertension and obesity. It is also reported that people who ate more fish were less prone to asthma and were able to breathe more easily. Omega 3 fish oil or fish consumption can help to prevent three of the most common forms of cancer: breast cancer, colon and prostate cancer. The omega 3 fatty acids present in fish or fish oil induce faster hair growth and prevent hair loss. Since most varieties of fish are rich in protein, eating fish helps to keep hair healthy. Furthermore, fish or fish oil helps in improving the condition of dry skin, giving it a healthy glow. It is useful in treating various skin problems such as eczema, psoriasis, itching, redness of skin, skin lesions and rashes. It is well known that eating fish improves vision and prevents Alzheimers and type-2 diabetes, and can combat arthritis. Further, fish oil or fish is good for pregnant women, as the DHA present in it helps in the development of the babys eyes and brain. It helps to avoid premature births, low birth weights and miscarriages. In addition, it is widely known that fish can be a good substitute for pulses in cereal-based diets for the poor. The global fish production was roughly 154 million tonnes in 2011 (FAO, 2012). It is estimated that by 2020 global fish requirements will be over 200 million tonnes; as such, innovative technological improvements are called for in order to improve the production and productivity in fisheries. In this context, this book provides valuable information for academics, scientists, researchers, government officials and farmers on innovative technological advances for sustainable fish production using aquaculture methods. The book identifies the main issues and trends in marine and brackishwater aquaculture from a global perspective in general and in the Indian context in particular. It includes 23 chapters written by prominent researchers from various institutes and universities across India, who address the latest aquaculture technologies with distinctive approaches to support academics, researchers and graduates in the fields of Fisheries, Aquaculture, Marine Science, Marine Biology, Marine Biotechnology, Zoology and Agricultural Sciences. Our thanks go to our contributors; we are confident that all readers will immensely benefit from their valued expertise in the field of marine and brackishwater aquaculture. Â© Springer India 2015.

TI  - Bi-Objective Optimization of Vessel Speed and Route for Sustainable Coastal Shipping under the Regulations of Emission Control Areas
JO  - Sustainability
PY  - 2019
VL  - 11
IS  - 22
AB  - To comply with the regulations of emission control areas (ECAs), most operators have to switch to low-sulfur fuels inside the ECAs. Besides, a low-carbon objective is essential for long-term environmental protection; thus, is regarded as important as making profit. Therefore, the operators start making speed and route decisions under the two objectives of minimizing carbon emissions and maximizing profit. Drawing on existing methods, this paper formulates the profit and carbon emissions in sustainable coastal shipping, investigates the speed and route principles, and determines the best tradeoff between profit and carbon emissions. It is found that vessel speed should be set between emissions-optimum speed and profit-optimum speed, and the route must be selected in light of the speed decision. Next, the optimal choices of speed and route were examined under different scenarios and vessel types. The results show that the operation measures and objectives depend greatly on fuel price, vessel load, and vessel parameters. The operator should speed up the vessel if he/she wants to make more profit or if the scenario is favorable for profit making; e.g., low fuel price and high vessel load (LFHL). Large vessels should pursue more profit under LFHL conditions, without having to sail further outside the ECA. But this rule does not apply to small vessels. In addition, the operator should slow down the vessel inside the ECA and sail further, outside the ECA, with the growth in the price spread between marine gas oil (MGO) and heavy fuel oil (HFO), especially at a low HFO price. The research findings help operators to design operational measures that best suit the limit on sulfur content in fuel and the situation of the shipping market.

AB  - Maritime transport plays a central role in the debate about the sustainability of the transport sector. Analyses suggest that air emissions from shipping account for a significant portion of total emissions, affect air quality, and contribute to climate change and human health problems. The existing trend suggests that the situation will worsen. These results, though affected by obvious uncertainties, highlight the urgent need to take action. Harmful environmental impacts are controlled primarily through legislation prohibiting the use of certain substances, setting limits on emissions, and enforcing certain technical standards. However, the basis for designing effective policy instruments to abate air emissions is finding reliable estimates of those emissions. For the shipping sector, a debate continues about the most appropriate way to achieve its air emissions estimate. This paper contributes to this debate by proposing a new methodology that applies some of the available theories from the naval design scientific field to derive a microscopic analytical formulation of the energy produced and consumed by a ship during its trips. The methodology proposed is applied to evaluations of potential savings in energy and emissions by adjusting the speed-acceleration profile of ships in port. Results achieved confirm the power of the methodology and open its application to other case studies. They also highlight an aspect usually neglected in the literature: the impact of ships' activities in port on the environment. The simple exercises performed show clearly the relevance of the issue. They are also able to show that better management of ships' movements in port may produce significant environmental benefits.

AB  - Since 1990, Europe and the European Commission have invested a huge amount of research in the geological storage of CO2, The aim was initially to create an inventory of potential storage sites and volumes, later to build models to study the subsurface behavior of CO2 and the storage matrix and to forecast possible problems, later still to perform risks analysis at all relevant time scales. Since Statoil started injecting CO2 on an industrial scale off-shore Norway in 1996, the focus has shifted to the monitoring of geological storage. Over the last ten years, experience has been acquired with both large scale projects (Sleipner, Norway; Weyburn, Canada) and more limited in scope, so called "subsurface laboratories" in Germany, The Netherlands and Poland. Two new geological storage projects (In Salah, Algeria and SnÃ¸hvit, Norway) now provide the opportunity to build on this work. The CO2ReMoVe project started on 1 March 2006. It is being carried out under the umbrella and with the support of the European Commission's Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technology Development. For five years, 30 partners from 12 different countries all over the world will invest EUR 15 million in an effort to bring together all relevant research and industry experience and know how in the field of underground storage of carbon dioxide. The consortium of industrial, research and service organizations proposes a range of monitoring techniques, applied over an integrated portfolio of storage sites in order to develop: 1. methods for base-line site evaluation; 2. new tools for monitoring storage and possible well and surface leakage; 3. new tools to predict and model long term storage behavior and risks; 4. a rigorous risk assessment methodology for a variety of sites and time scales; 5. Guidelines for best practice for the industry, policy makers and regulators. The recommendations from these international efforts will form an important step towards a worldwide consensus in licensing and certification of the storage activities in a number of geological media. These will include oil and gas reservoirs, coal seams and aquifers. It can be expected that the project will achieve a better understanding with the policy makers and the public that CO2 can be safely transported and stored in the subsurface and that this storage can at all times be safely monitored. The project will also provide the assurance required for geologically stored CO2 to qualify for credits under the emissions trading mechanism. It can be expected that the project will lead to greater understanding among policy-makers and the public that CO2 can be safely transported and stored in the subsurface, and that this storage can be safely monitored at all times the project will also provide the assurance required for geologically stored CO2 to qualify for credits under the emissions trading mechanism.

AB  - The IPCC forth assessment reported that the global mean sea level will rise by up to 59cm due to the melting of snow and glaciers on the land and thermal expansion of sea water if no effort is made to reduce emissions of green house gas. In an extreme prediction lowland areas in Korea could be vulnerable to inundation by a sea level rise of 69cm, which is 10 cm above that of the global mean. The area would be inundated by up to 393.44km(2) for a 60 cm rise in sea level, with total damage of US\$ 26,046 million in the dry land areas only. The highest cost of the damage is expected to be observed in the most industrialized areas of Korea with the highest annual income, even though the inundation would be most serious in the Jeonnam area. While areas will be inundated depending on their morphological characteristics, the socio and economic factors are also critical determinants of the cost of damage. A damage cost assessment is the first step in constructing policies and measures for responding to the rising sea level. The present cost estimation could be a component for the basis of building an adaptation strategy.

It can be grown in almost any enclosed space and it multiplies rapidly and requires very few inputs to flourish - mainly just sunlight, water and carbon dioxide and significant in the reduction of green house gases. Ethanol production from algae is better and efficient when compared with the generation from any other substrate because it is simple to ferment. Ethanol can also be produced by intracellular fermentation in algae. Algae can also be apart of integrated energy systems which can produce energy in different forms along with more useful by-products. Algae are very much sensitive towards the contamination that may hamper its growth. Genetic engineering can play an important role in developing the algae that can be used for the production of ethanol under the natural conditions.

AB  - This study was focused on the estimation of air pollutants, such as PM (particulate matters), Sox (sulfur oxides), COx (carbon dioxide), and NOx (nitrogen oxides), from a diesel propulsion engine installed on a naval vessel. Legislative and regulatory actions for exhaust emissions from ships are being strengthened in international communities and by national governments to protect human health and the environment. In this context, various technologies have been developed from all of the nations of the world to meet strict standards. These regulations are based on commercial ship applications and according to size, but are not suitable for military naval vessels, which have much different engine operating conditions, among other things. Additionally, there is no international emission control system for military ships. Emission factors have been updated for commercial ship types from work at various research institutes; however, it is difficult to develop emission factors for military vessels because of their specific characteristics. In this paper, exhaust emissions from diesel engines installed on naval vessels were estimated with emission factors calculated using fuel-based methods and fuel sulfur content analysis.

AB  - IMO is introducing two different emission indexes for a vessel: The Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI). The former will be used to assess the design of the vessel, the latter would be used to evaluate the vessel in operation. Both indexes represent the ratio between emissions, in mass of CO2, and the transported cargo quantity per sailed distance. At moment an important debate is focusing on the definition of the 'baseline' values for different ship categories. The collaboration between d'Amico Shipping Company, Registro Italiano Navale and Department of Naval Architecture, Marine Engineering, Electric Engineering of Genoa University provided the framework for a study aimed to evaluate the carbon footprint of the vessels of the D'Amico fleet, the analysis of various aspects of factors effecting the carbon dioxide emissions caused by ships and improvements of fleet energy management techniques. The results of the study can be divided into two main aspects: it is a picture of the actual carbon dioxide emission status of a cargo fleet and it gives the technical instruments and measure tools to start an emission control policy with reference to a ship energy efficiency management plan.

AB  - Greenhouse gases and other emissions from vessels and related activities in maritime trade have caused significant environmental impacts especially global warming of the atmosphere. Consequently, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) concern significant care to the reduction of ship emissions and improvement of energy efficiency through operational and technical measures. The proposed short-term measure is ship speed reduction in which the ship speed is reduced below its designed value. Therefore, the present paper aims at evaluating the potential energy efficiency and environmental benefits from using speed reduction measure through energy efficiency design index (EEDI), energy efficiency operational indicator (EEOI) and ship emissions calculation models as recommended from IMO. As a case study, a medium sized Container Ship is investigated. The results show that, reducing ship speed by 12.6\% will reduce CO2 emissions by about 36\%. Moreover, the attained EEDI value will be improved by 31.7\% and comply with not only the current IMO requirements but also with the future ones. Additionally, reducing ship speed by 12.6\% will reduce EEOI value from its value at design speed by 26.5\%. Furthermore, it is noticed that SOx emission will comply with IMO 2020 limit if ship speed is reduced by 6.8\% and above.

AB  - With the increasingly serious pollution from the ships berthing at port and the emergence of low-carbon policies, shore power (SP) and low sulfur fuel oil (LSFO) have become effective means to reduce the emissions from ships berthing in the ports. In order to analyse two emission mitigation strategies, we establish a noncooperative game model in a transport chain consisting of a terminal and two carriers who adopt SP or LSFO strategy and obtain the equilibrium results and pricing strategies under different conditions. We observe that, when the carbon price is lower than a threshold, both carriers will choose LSFO; otherwise, both carriers will adopt SP. However, if the two carriers cooperate to maximize their total profits, they will simultaneously choose LSFO when the carbon price is lower than another threshold or choose SP when the carbon price is higher than the threshold, which will maximize the total profits of the transport chain. If the carbon price is less than the threshold, the consumer surplus will be maximized when two carriers adopt LSFO, otherwise the consumer surplus will be maximized when two carriers use SP. If two carriers cooperate to maximize their total profits, this will maximize the entire transport chain's profits and the consumer surplus. Finally, the validity of model is verified by taking Shenzhen Port as an example.

JO  - International Journal Of Electrical Power And Energy Systems
PY  - 2021
VL  - 133
IS  - NA
AB  - Low frequency AC technology has been presented as a configuration that can potentially reduce the total cost of existing transmission systems. Such cost reduction could be achieved by increasing the power transfer capacity of High Voltage AC cables operating at low frequency and removing the offshore converter when compared to High Voltage DC systems. The purpose of this paper is to suggest an optimal design of Low Frequency AC transmission systems. This results in obtaining the optimal Low Frequency AC voltage level, location, number of reactors and the Back-to-Back converter size for an Offshore Wind Power Plants with a defined rated power and distance to shore. Additionally, the Low Frequency AC, High Voltage AC and High Voltage DC equivalent configurations are compared in terms of total cost and the final transmission system is selected. The analysis of a practical case study is presented in detail, followed by an expansion of the methodology application on various configurations. Also, cost sensitivity analyses for two opposed cases are provided to identify the variation of the break-even distance of Low Frequency AC with High Voltage AC and High Voltage DC. Lastly, different non-standard transmission frequencies are analyzed and an optimal frequency is defined for a range of Offshore Wind Power Plants rated powers and distances. The paper presents a methodology that can be applied considering different relevant parameters, e.g. transmission voltages, cable cross sections and cost data.

AB  - Three-dimensional unsteady eddy numerical simulations are carried out for the hydraulic performances of the pit turbine unit of a tidal power station by using the detached-eddy model based on the CFD method. The pressure pulsation information at key measuring points located in the passage under different water heads is obtained and analyzed. The results show that all the pressure pulsation in the whole passage of the tidal pit turbine contains rotation frequency, and the nearer the distance to the runner is, the larger is the amplitude of the rotation frequency. The pressure pulsation at the runner chamber is strong, and its amplitude increases with the increase of water heads. The predominant frequency is the rotation frequency with three and six times. The pressure pulsation at the inlet side of guide vanes and the outlet conduit is weak and its frequency is low. Change of the water head has a little effect on the pressure pulsation at the inlet side of guide vanes. The flow regime in the outlet conduit is the best under the design condition, and the pressure pulsation is the smallest.

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Demagnetization of permanent magnet machines is a fault that evolves over time leading to an eventual catastrophic failure. This condition is of particular interest in renewables, with emphasis on remote applications such as offshore wind, tidal and wave energy harvesting. Moreover, the demagnetization fault can be either uniform or non-uniform. The strong majority of research papers are focusing on nonuniform demagnetization and typically study the case of a single faulty magnet. This is because, the uniform demagnetization does not create harmonics that can be detected with spectral methods. Despite the above, the study of single magnet demagnetization studies have been criticized due to being unrealistic to describe most practical cases where permanent magnet machines are subjected to demagnetization due to overloading and/or overheating conditions and leading to uniform demagnetization. This paper sheds some light into such theories, while studying a, realistically induced in the lab, demagnetization case of a direct-drive C-GEN permanent magnet generator. Â© 2022 IEEE.

AB  - This study used a stated preference approach to assess potential impacts of offshore wind farms on recreational boaters in and around Rhode Island (US) waters. To develop the stated preference survey, seven focus groups were conducted with recreational boaters in Rhode Island (RI) in 2017. A combined mail and on-line choice experiment survey was administered in the spring and summer 2018 to 2500 owners of US Coast Guard documented recreational vessels with a hailing port in Rhode Island. The survey instrument elicited recreational boaters' preferences for particular attributes of a recreational boating trip (location, proximity to a wind farm, amount of nearby boating activity, main activity during trip, trip costs). Data were analyzed using the mixed logit model to understand how changes in individual attributes affect the acceptability of a boating trip. Findings indicate that the value of a recreational boating experience is considerably reduced in areas with offshore wind farms. Findings from this study provide valuable insights into the potential impacts of the growing offshore wind industry on one group of marine resource users and potential management strategies for addressing these impacts in the US.

PY  - 2017
VL  - 55
IS  - 1
AB  - Sea-level rise and saline water intrusion have caused a shortage of fresh water and affected agricultural areas globally. Besides inundation, the salinity could alter soil nitrogen and carbon cycling in coastal soils. To examine the effect of salinity, an incubation experiment was used to investigate soil nitrogen and carbon cycling from an acid sulfate soil and an alluvial soil with and without additional nitrogen and carbon sources. Four levels of saline solution of 0.03, 10, 16 and 21dSm-1 were used to submerge acid sulfate and alluvial soil samples in a 125-mL jar. The experimental jars were incubated in the dark at 25Â°C. Gas samples were collected over 4 weeks and analysed for nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). The results showed that salinity significantly decreased N2O emissions from the acid sulfate soil but did not affect emissions from the alluvial soil. Addition of glucose and nitrate enhanced N2O production in both salt-affected soils. Emissions of CO2 were not different among the salinity treatments, whereas available carbon and nitrate promoted soil respiration. Changes in CH4 fluxes over the 4-week incubation were the same for both soils, and substrate addition did not affect emissions in either soil. The findings indicate that salinity has altered carbon and nitrogen cycles in the acid sulfate soil, and future fertiliser and crop management will need to account for the changed nutrient cycling caused by saline water intrusion and climate change.

The article starts by summarizing three of the main innovation challenges facing the offshore wind sector harsh conditions, capital intensity, and production bottlenecks before it delves into the specific details about how Vestas and Siemens Wind Power approach turbine development. It divides this discussion into six distinct segments: resources and expenditures, stakeholder involvement and collaboration, testing and maintenance, control and knowledge management, adaptability of designs, and customization and marketing. The study finds that both Vestas and SWP, despite their corporate and cultural differences, utilize the same elements of closed and open styles. It lastly suggests that the notion of style itself may challenge certain assumptions held by scholars about managing the research and innovation process. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Lipid Remodeling Reveals the Adaptations of a Marine Diatom to Ocean Acidification
JO  - Frontiers In Microbiology
PY  - 2021
VL  - 12
IS  - NA
AB  - Ocean acidification is recognized as a major anthropogenic perturbation of the modern ocean. While extensive studies have been carried out to explore the short-term physiological responses of phytoplankton to ocean acidification, little is known about their lipidomic responses after a long-term ocean acidification adaptation. Here we perform the lipidomic analysis of a marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum following long-term (similar to 400 days) selection to ocean acidification conditions. We identified a total of 476 lipid metabolites in long-term high CO2 (i.e., ocean acidification condition) and low CO2 (i.e., ambient condition) selected P. tricornutum cells. Our results further show that long-term high CO2 selection triggered substantial changes in lipid metabolites by down- and up-regulating 33 and 42 lipid metabolites. While monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) was significantly down-regulated in the long-term high CO2 selected conditions, the majority (similar to 80\%) of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) was up-regulated. The tightly coupled regulations (positively or negatively correlated) of significantly regulated lipid metabolites suggest that the lipid remodeling is an organismal adaptation strategy of marine diatoms to ongoing ocean acidification. Since the composition and content of lipids are crucial for marine food quality, and these changes can be transferred to high trophic levels, our results highlight the importance of determining the long-term adaptation of lipids in marine producers in predicting the ecological consequences of climate change.

AB  - Vertical axis wind turbine is gradually playing a great potential in offshore floating wind power generation system. In order to improve the starting performance of vertical axis wind turbine, an asymmetric-primary axial-flux hybrid-excitation generator (APAFHG) for offshore vertical axis maglev wind turbine is proposed. However, the complexity of the controllable levitation force makes it difficult to control the generator. In this paper, the levitation force characteristics of APAFHG under different currents are analyzed and the mathematical model of levitation force is derived. First, the topology and operation principle of APAFHG are introduced, Second, the levitation force performance of APAFHG under DC excitation, d-axis and q-axis current is obtained by finite element method, and the characteristics of levitation force are analyzed with the change of applied current. Finally, the mathematical model of APAFHG levitation force is deduced and verified. The results show that the characteristics and the mathematical model of levitation force can play an important role in the control of levitation force and the decoupling control of power and levitation force.

AB  - Offshore wind energy capitalizes on the higher and less turbulent wind at sea. Shallow water sites are profitable for deployment of monopile wind turbines at water depths of up to 30 meters. Beyond 30 meters, the wind is even stronger and less turbulent. At these depths, floating wind turbines become profitable, capable of accessing unexploited wind resources while reaching regions of new consumers. However, floating wind turbines are subject to reduced structural stiffness which results in instabilities when standard wind turbine control systems are applied. Based on optimal control, this paper presents a new minimum thrust control strategy capable of stabilizing a floating wind turbine. The new control strategy explores the freedom of variable generator speed above rated wind speed. A comparison to the traditional constant speed strategy, shows improvements in structural fore-aft oscillations and power stability when using the new control strategy.

AB  - Hybrid Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells/Lithium-ion battery powertrains are a promising solution for zero-local-emissions marine propulsion. The present study aims to optimize the design and operation of such hybrid powertrain for small-size passenger ferries, taking into account the performance degradation of both fuel cells and batteries. A Mixed-Integer Linear-Programming approach and a hierarchical method are adopted to concurrently minimize the fuel cells degradation, the capital expenditure and the operating expenditure, while constraints are included in the model to limit the battery degradation. The results show that the proposed multi-objective optimization can lead to a reduction of fuel cells degradation by up to 65\% compared to a cost-minimization only. However, this can imply an increase in the battery capacity by up to 136\%. The proposed method has general validity, and it is a useful tool for both preliminary design and choice of the optimal energy management strategy for ships energy systems.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11

AB  - The North Sea basin is one of the busiest maritime areas globally with a considerable number of anthropogenic pressures impacting the functioning of the marine ecosystem. Due to growing EU ambitions for the deployment of large offshore wind farm projects (OWF), as part of the 2050 renewable energy roadmap, there is a key need for a holistic understanding of OWF potential impacts on the marine ecosystem. We propose a holistic Cumulative Effect Assessment methodology, applied using a geo-spatial open-source software, to assess impacts of OWF related pressures on selected seabed habitats, fish, seabird and mammal species. We take into account pressures specific to the three OWF development phases, spanning 1999â€“2050, for the entire North Sea basin. Our results underline 2022 as the peak year of cumulative impacts for the approved OWFs, followed by a considerable increase in potential impacts of the planned 212GWs, by 2050. The spatio-temporal analysis of the OWF environmental impacts presents the shift between highly impacted areas over the studied timeline and distinguishes between concentrated areas of high impacts (Sâ€“E of UK) and dispersed areas of high impacts (Germany). Our results can inform decision-makers and the OWF industry in a joint effort to mitigate the environmental impacts of future large OWF developments. Â© 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Expected limits on the ocean acidification buffering potential of a temperate seagrass meadow
JO  - Ecological Applications
PY  - 2018
VL  - 28
IS  - 7
AB  - Ocean acidification threatens many marine organisms, especially marine calcifiers. The only global-scale solution to ocean acidification remains rapid reduction in CO2 emissions. Nevertheless, interest in localized mitigation strategies has grown rapidly because of the recognized threat ocean acidification imposes on natural communities, including ones important to humans. Protection of seagrass meadows has been considered as a possible approach for localized mitigation of ocean acidification due to their large standing stocks of organic carbon and high productivity. Yet much work remains to constrain the magnitudes and timescales of potential buffering effects from seagrasses. We developed a biogeochemical box model to better understand the potential for a temperate seagrass meadow to locally mitigate the effects of ocean acidification. Then we parameterized the model using data from Tomales Bay, an inlet on the coast of California, USA which supports a major oyster farming industry. We conducted a series of month-long model simulations to characterize processes that occur during summer and winter. We found that average pH in the seagrass meadows was typically within 0.04 units of the pH of the primary source waters into the meadow, although we did find occasional periods (hours) when seagrass metabolism may modify the pH by up to +/- 0.2 units. Tidal phasing relative to the diel cycle modulates localized pH buffering within the seagrass meadow such that maximum buffering occurs during periods of the year with midday low tides. Our model results suggest that seagrass metabolism in Tomales Bay would not provide long-term ocean acidification mitigation. However, we emphasize that our model results may not hold in meadows where assumptions about depth-averaged net production and seawater residence time within the seagrass meadow differ from our model assumptions. Our modeling approach provides a framework that is easily adaptable to other seagrass meadows in order to evaluate the extent of their individual buffering capacities. Regardless of their ability to buffer ocean acidification, seagrass meadows maintain many critically important ecosystem goods and services that will be increasingly important as humans increasingly affect coastal ecosystems.

AB  - Vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) are advantageous for the development of large-scale offshore wind power because the drive system is located at the bottom of the turbine. This study investigates the structural strength of a tri-floater floating foundation supporting a 2.6 MW Darrieus VAWT. Finite element models of the floating foundation were developed using space plate-beam elements. The environmental loads, such as the aerodynamic loads, static wind loads, and wave-current loads, were considered. The general strengths of the floating foundation were calculated for the normal operating case (a cut-out wind speed of 25 m s(-1) and blade rotation of 12 r min(-1) were used to analyze the most unfavorable loads) and an extreme case (wind speed of 40 m s(-1) and parked blades), and the weak components of the structure were analyzed. The results show that the floating foundation meets the strength requirements and the structural stress is highest when the wave, wind, and current are in a collinear direction. The main and secondary supporting bars transmit the loads between the stand columns and the tower foundation, and their stresses are higher than those in the other components. In the actual design, these supporting bars should be strengthened. The aerodynamic loads are very important and should be considered in the structural strength analysis of the floating foundation and the floating wind turbine system.

TI  - Maritime shipping and emissions: A three-layered, damage-based approach
JO  - Ocean Engineering
PY  - 2015
VL  - 110
IS  - NA
AB  - Policy emphasis in ship design must be shifted away from global and idealized towards regional based and realistic vessel operating conditions. The present approach to reducing shipping emissions through technical standards tends to neglect how damages and abatement opportunities vary according to location and operational conditions. Since environmental policy originates in damages relating to ecosystems and jurisdictions, a three-layered approach to vessel emissions is intuitive and practical. Here, we suggest associating damages and policies with ports, coastal areas possibly defined as Emission Control Areas (ECA) as in the North Sea and the Baltic, and open seas globally. This approach offers important practical opportunities: in ports, clean fuels or even electrification is possible; in ECAs, cleaner fuels and penalties for damaging fuels are important, but so is vessel handling, such as speeds and utilization. Globally we argue that it may be desirable to allow burning very dirty fuels at high seas, due to the cost advantages, the climate cooling benefits, and the limited ecosystem impacts. We quantify the benefits and cost savings from reforming current IMO and other approaches towards environmental management with a three-layered approach, and argue it is feasible and worth considering.

TI  - ON THE FURTHER OPTIMIZATION OF THE `GREEN WATER CONCEPT' FOR WAVE ENERGY CONVERSION
JO  - NANA
PY  - 2013
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - This paper presents initial results from the following-up study of the `inverse' or `green water concept' for wave energy conversion. Initially presented in 2009, the `inverse concept' was developed by MARIN as a vehicle for open discussion and exchange of ideas in the field of wave energy conversion. Pilot model tests presented in 2010 showed the great potential of the concept, but also revealed the challenges associated with Power Take Off design. The present study aims to further optimize the inverse concept. A new PTO system has been incorporated, based on robustness and effective use of the structure's (de)optimized hull. The resulting renewed concept combines maximized vessel motions with OWC-type of wave energy conversion. This paper focuses on the motion response of the renewed concept. Frequency domain calculations show the response of the concept with water columns (moonpools) at the bow and stern. Remarkably, the already maximized motions of the hull become even more extreme when moonpools are incorporated Special attention is given to the relative motions of the water inside the moonpools, as these give an indication of the wave energy conversion potential of the concept. The relative water motions inside the moonpools show a large response that is characterized by multiple peaks. This indicates the concept's ability to convert energy in a wide range of sea states. Results from additional diffraction analysis show that through proper tuning, the water columns inside the moonpools can be modeled as solid water-bodies. This allows for a future numerical modeling of the hydrodynamic interaction between structure, water columns, entrapped air and PTO damping in the time domain.

Among the companies that have gambled using water wave as a source of power are Finavera, Pelamis, and Wave Dragon. Meanwhile, because of highly tidal predictability, many companies are staking their invesments on tidal stream. In 2007, Marine Current Turbines, staked its claims to be the first tidal energy company to connect power to the grid as part of a commercial project when it submerged SeaGen, its tidal generator, in the turbulent currents of Strangford Narrows in Northern Ireland. SeaGen consists of twin rotors 16m in diameter, each driving a generator via a gearbox. The rotor blades can work in both directions, allowing them to make use of the tide both the coming and the ebbing. Although some are already in the market, wave power is still in its research and development stage. It is a question of finding the right conversion mechanism and further a matter of building one at a reasonable cost that can survive the elements. As the industry is new, it is too early to judge which is better, tidal stream or wave power.

JO  - Science Technology \& Human Values
PY  - 2011
VL  - 36
IS  - 2
AB  - Many geoengineering projects have been proposed to address climate change, including both solar radiation management and carbon removal techniques. Some of these methods would introduce additional compounds into the atmosphere or the ocean. This poses a difficult conundrum: Is it permissible to remediate one pollutant by introducing a second pollutant into a system that has already been damaged, threatened, or altered? We frame this conundrum as the ``Problem of Permissible Pollution.'' In this paper, we explore this problem by taking up ocean fertilization and advancing an argument that rests on three moral claims. We first observe that pollution is, in many respects, a context-dependent matter. This observation leads us to argue for a ``justifiability criterion.'' Second, we suggest that remediating actions must take into account the antecedent conditions that have given rise to their consideration. We call this second observation the ``antecedent conditions criterion.'' Finally, we observe that ocean fertilization, and other related geoengineering technologies, propose not strictly to clean up carbon emissions, but actually to move the universe to some future, unknown state. Given the introduced criteria, we impose a ``future-state constraint''. We conclude that ocean fertilization is not an acceptable solution for mitigating climate change. In attempting to shift the universe to a future state (a) geoengineering sidelines consideration of the antecedent conditions that have given rise to it-conditions, we note, that in many cases involve unjustified carbon emissions -and (b) it must appeal to an impossibly large set of affected parties.

VL  - 10
IS  - NA
AB  - Power production from the high energy density offshore wind has now emerged as a potential source of renewable energy for the future of mankind. While the installed global cumulative offshore wind capacity in 2014 was around 8 GW [1], almost all of this came from the shallow water sites (water depths equal to 25m or less) where typical bottom founded structures (such as: monopole, jacket, concrete gravity type, etc.) are used to support the turbines. Today, most of the shallow water sites are exhausted, and the industry is looking for setting up turbines at the deeper water sites, where the existing bottom founded structures tend to become massive and expensive. On the other hand, the floating wind turbine concept, apart from being expensive, is more suitable for water depth of 100 m or more. It is expected that in the near future, the industry will primarily focus on concepts that may extend the application range of the existing bottom founded structures towards the deeper waters. In this paper, a novel support structure concept termed "Bottom supported tension leg tower" is presented, and its preliminary technical feasibility is checked for a monopile type structure for 50 m water depth. The concept can also be used with a jacket or a gravity type support structure. The potential of using the monopile based structure at 100m water depth is also briefly addressed. Â© 2017 ASME.

JO  - Marine Ecology Progress Series
PY  - 2022
VL  - 698
IS  - NA
AB  - We assessed the release of greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4) from air-exposed sediments and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from inundated sediments in 2 Brazilian mangrove forests. Our focus was on the impact of biogenic structures, i.e. pneumatophores and crab burrows, on greenhouse gas emissions. Emission of CO2 from air-exposed bare sediment (111-156 and 57-148 mmol m-2 d-1 in darkness and in light, respectively) was comparable to DIC release from inundated sediment (122-158 and 52-62 mmol m-2 d-1, respectively). Pneumatophores and crab burrows increased dark CO2 emission during air exposure by 113-123 and 49-91\%, respectively. CH4 emission from air-exposed bare sediment (0.22-0.25 mmol m-2 d-1) was increased 92-137 and 288-607\%, respectively, by pneumatophores and burrows. Carbon loss in the form of CO2 and DIC from sediments with biogenic structures can at the two study locations be extrapolated to 64.1 and 71.0 mol C m-2 yr-1. These values fit well with literature values of litterfall in the studied area, providing carbon accretion of 28.5 and 21.6 mol C m-2 yr-1. However, the budget will be unbalanced if the role of biogenic structures is not considered. In the presence of biogenic structures, CH4 emissions of 2.8 and 3.3 mol C m-2 yr-1 (when converted to CO2 units) will partly (10-15\%) counteract the climate mitigation effect of the accumulated carbon. Carbon budgets in mangrove sediments may therefore be flawed if the contribution of biogenic structures to greenhouse gas emissions is ignored.

AB  - Searching for a new eco-friendly marine fuel has become necessary to eliminate the adverse effects arising from shipsâ€™ emissions. The current paper investigates using blue/green ammonia as a marine alternative fuel from environmental and economic points of view. A new RO/RO vessel under construction is investigated as a case study. Three propulsion systems are considered: heavy fuel diesel engine, blue/green ammonia diesel engine and blue/green solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). Environmentally, SOFC green ammonia-fueled ship is the best selection with NOx and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissionsâ€™ reduction of 93.4% and 92% compared with the traditional propulsion system. Economically, SOFC blue ammonia-fueled ship will be the best selection with total ship saving cost of 5.71% and annual levelized cost of energy 0.19 $/kWh. Finally, SOFC green ammonia-fueled ship proposes to be eco-friendly with cost effectiveness of 172.92 $/ton-emissions as a step forward to achieve IMO 2030 strategy. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the upper Bay of Fundy on Canada's east coast, with the world's largest tides and located close to a major electrical energy market, tidal power plants (TPPs) are likely to offer substantial quantities of economical, clean, renewable energy. Each coastal zone however has its own specific environmental characteristics which translate into environmental concerns when TPPs are being contemplated. At Fundy, the most important of these concerns are: A-siltation, B-shorebird survival, C-fish-stock survival, D-sea-mammal survival, E-drainage of agricultural lands and F-changes in the tidal regime in the Bay of Fundy-Gulf of Maine Basin. The tools are available to assess these concerns qualitatively which the paper demonstrates. For the quantitative assessment of the ecological concerns however, i.e. the concerns relating to living organisms, the overall performance of an ecologically designed, built and operated pilot TPP is required. When a pilot plant can be proven to operate symbiotically with a thriving marine and shore-based flora and fauna can the construction of a full-fledged TPP be considered.

AB  - The design and selection on outgoing power cables of offshore wind farm affect the security and stability operation of power system. In this paper, based on a practical offshore wind farm in Jiangsu Province, modeling and comparative analysis of two typical outgoing power cables, those are three-core and single-core submarine cables at 35 kV, for offshore wind farms are implemented. Considering the costs of one-time investment and lifetime operating, an economical mathematical model for outgoing power cables is established. Additionally, combining structural and environmental parameters of outgoing power cables, transient heat transfer model is proposed and real-time simulated with finite element software Comsol. According to the economy and heat transfer reliability models, comprehensive comparative analyses were done between the two typical cables. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of the two typical cables and application conditions are summarized, which provide an important reference for future application of outgoing power cables for offshore wind farms.

AB  - A novel wave energy converter concept is developed at Uppsala University, Department of Engineering Science. The concept is based on a synchronous permanent magnet linear generator, placed on the seabed. The piston of the generator is directly connected to a surface-floating buoy with a rope. The tension in the rope is maintained with springs that pull the piston downward. The three-phase current induced in the stator coil has a varying amplitude and frequency and a conversion is therefore necessary. Research has been carried out in three main areas: generator design, dynamic behavior and grid connection. The generator is modeled by full physics numeric simulations, based on a 2-dimensional finite element formulation of the time dependent electromagnetic field. A first set up is built to experimentally verify the simulated results. The impact of different parameters are estimated with mathematical models and verified by experiments. This paper includes both simulated and experimental results. Copyright Â© 2005 by ASME.

AB  - The colloquial term 'cold-ironing' refers to connecting a ship to shore power when it is at berth, as its main and auxiliary engines, made of steel/iron, are shut down, literally becoming cold. In the current environment where strict emission regulations govern virtually every ship operation, shore power has become an essential service sought by ships at berth in emission controlled ports. At present, these ships in port can receive shore power only when they are at berth, usually during the transfer of cargo or passengers. However, there are many more ships anchored in and around the ports awaiting access to berths. Efficient supply of shore power to these anchored ships is a challenge and thus they rely on their on-board power generation systems to supply essential loads. As the waiting time can vary from a few hours to weeks, emissions from these ships are significant, especially as they are clustered together in close proximity to land. Therefore, if an efficient and effective way of powering anchored ships with clean or low emission power is available, it can significantly contribute towards reducing emission around busy ports as well as the operating cost of anchored ships. In an attempt to address this problem, authors propose a floating power platform for 'offshore coldironing'. The proposed system consists of a fuel cell, a battery bank, and a small LNG engine driven generator set installed on a floating platform such as a barge and moored in close proximity to the anchored ships to supply them with their required electrical power. Nowadays, with the advancements of the fuel cell technology, installation of a suitable fuel cell stack on a floating platform such as a barge has become feasible. Nevertheless, fuel cells response slowly and thus fast dynamic loads such as dynamic positioning load in adverse sea conditions can easily push the fuel cell beyond its safe operating range, possibly creating power system instabilities that can result in blackouts. In addition, the floating platform itself needs dynamic positioning or some form of control to maintain its position relative to supplied ships, further influencing the dynamic load. The battery bank can support the fuel cell to cope with such loads. However, in extreme situations, even the battery bank will discharge rapidly and the fuel cell may struggle to charge it. Therefore, when the state of charge of the battery bank drops below a defined lower threshold, the LNG engine-driven generator set starts and provides boost power to charge the batteries. As the generator is used only when the battery charge is low, and the emission from the LNG is relatively low in comparison to other fossil fuels used on-board, the proposed system can be considered as a low emission technology solution. The feasibility of the proposed concept of floating power platform, from the power system control perspective, is investigated in this paper through modelling and simulation, with the results clearly showing the efficacy of the proposed hybrid power system to supply the dynamic loads encountered on anchored ships.

JO  - Global Biogeochemical Cycles
PY  - 2022

AB  - About a quarter of the total anthropogenic CO2 emissions during the industrial era has been absorbed by the ocean. The rate limiting step for this uptake is the transport of the anthropogenic carbon (C-ant) from the ocean mixed layer where it is absorbed to the interior ocean where it is stored. While it is generally known that deep water formation sites are important for vertical carbon transport, the exact magnitude of the fluxes across the base of the mixed layer in different regions is uncertain. Here, we determine where, when, and how much C-ant has been injected across the mixed-layer base and into the interior ocean since the start of the industrialized era. We do this by combining a transport matrix derived from observations with a time-evolving boundary condition obtained from already published estimates of ocean C-ant. Our results show that most of the C-ant stored below the mixed layer are injected in the subtropics (40.1\%) and the Southern Ocean (36.0\%), while the Subpolar North Atlantic has the largest fluxes. The Subpolar North Atlantic is also the most important region for injecting C-ant into the deep ocean with 81.6\% of the C-ant reaching depths greater than 1,000 m. The subtropics, on the other hand, have been the most efficient in transporting C-ant across the mixed-layer base per volume of water ventilated. This study shows how the oceanic C-ant uptake relies on vertical transports in a few oceanic regions and sheds light on the pathways that fill the ocean C-ant reservoir.

AB  - Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI) is commonly mentioned as a potential efficient and clean combustion concept. This study makes the first evaluation of natural gas-diesel RCCI combustion for mid-speed marine engines. A state-of-the-art dual-fuel engine with 350 mm bore diameter is the basis for numerical simulations. GT-Power is used to create a one-dimensional air-path model. RCCI is simulated using TNO's multi-zone combustion model incorporating detailed chemical kinetics. The simulations aim to optimize engine efficiency, with peak in-cylinder pressure and emissions as constraints. The study shows best-point Indicated Efficiency of 47.8\% is achievable (@75\% load) using RCCI mode on stock engine hardware, while meeting IMO Tier III's NO limit. This performance is similar to the best contemporary marine gas engines, but RCCI also provides additional methane and CO emission reductions. Thus, RCCI combustion can meet Europe's new rigorous Stage V limits, offering significant improvements in a marine engine's GHG footprint. Crucially, the study indicates an engine using hardware optimized for RCCI could deliver outstanding indicated efficiencies of 52\%, with emissions of below 1 g/kWh for all legislative species. This combination of high efficiency and ultra-low emissions would make RCCI combustion an attractive proposition for future marine propulsion and gen-set applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
