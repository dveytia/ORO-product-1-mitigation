AB  - This paper is about understanding the role and importance of public responses to offshore wind power. It builds on a framework for understanding social acceptance and opposition to onshore turbines, and reviews the emerging research on offshore wind. While less is known about how people will respond to offshore than onshore wind, there is now an emerging body of research. From this literature, several common factors which influence responses have emerged and are discussed here: the (continued) role of visual impact; place attachment to the local area; lack of tangible benefits; relationships with developers and outsiders; and the role of the planning and decision-making systems. The paper argues that, as with onshore developments, the public should be included in decision-making about offshore wind farms, and that they have a key role which should not be underestimated. The paper concludes with some thoughts about the means to involve people and how effected communities might be effectively acknowledged, identified and engaged. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Dual wave farms and coastline dynamics: The role of inter-device spacing
JO  - Science Of The Total Environment
PY  - 2019
VL  - 646
IS  - NA
AB  - In dual wave farms, i.e., arrays of wave energy converters (WECs) with a dual function - generation of renewable power and mitigation of coastal erosion - the spacing between the WECs is a fundamental design parameter. The present research has the objective of establishing how this parameter affects the shoreline evolution behind the array and, on this basis, to propose and apply a method to determine the optimum spacing for coastal protection. The method is demonstrated on a beach subjected to severe erosion. Five case studies are considered: four with different inter-WEC spacings, and one without the wave farm (baseline). A spectral wave propagation model is applied to analyse the variations in significant wave height behind the WEC array. Longshore sediment transport rates are calculated, and a shoreline model is applied. We find that in all the case studies the dry beach area is greater than in the baseline (no farm) case study, which proves the capacity of the dual WEC array to mitigate the erosive trends of the system. Importantly, we obtain that the inter-WEC spacing plays a fundamental role in the evolution of the shoreline and, consequently, in the effectiveness of the WEC array for coastal protection. The case studies with intermediate spacings yield the best performance in terms of dry beach area. More generally, the benefits of dual wave farms in terms of protection of coastal properties and infrastructure, and the ensuing savings in conventional coastal defence measures (coastal structures, beach nourishment, etc.) contribute to the development of wave energy by enhancing its economic viability. The methodology presented in this paper can be used to optimize the design of dual wave farms elsewhere. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - It has been reported that deep saline aquifers represent the largest geologic CO2 storage resource. To better predict containment effectiveness and long-term reservoir behavior of these formations, it is important to understand the potential geochemically induced changes to the porosity and permeability of both the primary sealing formation and CO2 storage formation rocks. To investigate these potential changes, an experimental study to probe the geochemical interactions of CO2/brine/rock system under geologic CO2 storage conditions was conducted in a static reaction system. Marine shale (primary sealing formation) and Lower Tuscaloosa sandstone (CO2 storage formation) core samples taken from the Plant Daniel CO2 storage test site (Jackson County, Mississippi) were exposed to CO2-saturated brine in a batch reactor at relevant geologic storage conditions (85 degrees C and 23.8 MPa CO2 pressure) for 6 months. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, computed tomography, and brine chemistry analyses were performed before and after the exposure. Permeability measurements from the marine shale and sandstone core samples before and after CO2/brine exposure indicated a significant effective permeability change. Sealing marine shale permeability increased following exposure while the permeability of the sandstone from the storage formation was observed to decrease. Analysis results of the primary sealing formation sample (marine shale) at the Plant Daniel CO2 storage test site have not been reported before. The permeability decrease of the Lower Tuscaloosa sandstone sample reported in this study verifies the results reported in a previous study. These results have implications for the integrity of the primary seal in a CO2 storage setting.

PY  - 2021
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Recently, the stringent international regulations on ship energy efficiency and NOx emissions from ocean-going ships make energy conservation and emission reduction be the theme of the shipping industry. Due to its fuel economy and reliability, most large commercial vessels are propelled by a low-speed two-stroke marine diesel engine, which consumes most of the fuel in the ship. In the present work, a zero-dimensional model is developed, which considers the blow-by, exhaust gas bypass, gas exchange, turbocharger, and heat transfer. Meanwhile, the model is improved by considering the heating effect of the blow-by gas on the intake gas. The proposed model is applied to a MAN B&amp;W low-speed two-stroke marine diesel engine and validated with the engine shop test data. The simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental results. The accuracy of the model is greatly improved after considering the heating effect of blow-by gas. The model accuracy of most parameters has been improved from within 5% to within 2%, by considering the heating effect of blow-by gas. Finally, the influence of blow-by area change on engine performance is analyzed with considering and without considering the heating effect of blow-by. Â© IMechE 2021.

AB  - Concerns about harmful exhaust emissions from ships have been an issue. Specifically, the emissions at ports are the most serious. This paper introduces a hybrid power system that combines conventional diesel generators with two different energy storage systems (ESSs) (lithium-ion batteries (LIB) and supercapacitors (SC)) focused on port operations of ships. To verify the proposed system, a bulk carrier with four deck cranes is selected as a target ship, and each size (capacity) of LIB and SC is determined based on assumed power demands. The determined sizes are proven to be sufficient for a target ship through simulation results. Lastly, the proposed system is compared to a conventional one in terms of the environmental and economic aspects. The results show that the proposed system can reduce emissions (CO2, SOX, and NOx) substantially and has a short payback period, particularly for ships that have a long cargo handling time or visit many ports with a short-term sailing time. Therefore, the proposed system could be an eco-friendly and economical solution for bulk carriers for emission problems at ports.

TI  - A NUMERICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF MARINE HYDROGEN-NATURAL GAS-DIESEL TRI-FUEL ENGINES
JO  - Polish Maritime Research
PY  - 2020
VL  - 27
IS  - 4
AB  - Maritime shipping is a key component of the global economy, representing 80-90\% of international trade. To deal with the energy crisis and marine environmental pollution, hydrogen-natural gas-diesel tri-fuel engines have become an attractive option for use in the maritime industry. In this study, numerical simulations and experimental tests were used to evaluate the effects of different hydrogen ratios on the combustion and emissions from these engines. The results show that, in terms of combustion performance, as the hydrogen proportion increases, the combustion ignition delay time in the cylinder decreases and the laminar flame speed increases. The pressure and temperature in the cylinder increase and the temperature field distribution expands more rapidly with a higher hydrogen ratio. This means that the tri-fuel engine (H-2+CH4+Diesel) has a faster response and better power performance than the dual fuel engine (CH4+Diesel). In terms of emission performance, as the hydrogen proportion increases, the NO emissions increase, and CO and CO2 emissions decrease. If factors such as methane escape into the atmosphere from the engine are considered, the contribution of marine tri-fuel engines to reducing ship exhaust emissions will be even more significant. Therefore, this study shows that marine hydrogen-natural gas-diesel tri-fuel engines have significant application and research prospects.

TI  - South region of the gulf of California large marine ecosystem upwelling, fluxes of CO2 and nutrients
JO  - Environmental Development
PY  - 2017
VL  - 22
IS  - NA
AB  - The Gulf of California Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) is one of the most productive and biologically rich marine ecosystems in the world with a high rate of endemic species. The combination of high biological productivity and biological richness characterizing the region is the result of its unique geology and geography, shaping strong currents and tides that generate the upwelling of cool, nutrient-rich waters. These waters support an extremely high abundance of plankton that in turn is the basis of a complex food web sustaining a diversity of fish, birds, and marine mammals. As Mexico's most important fishery region, the Gulf of California provides seafood to locals and for export to other countries. In addition, manifold coastal lagoons, coastal marine sea-beds, mangrove forests, and 922 islands are important reproductive, nesting and nursing sites for hundreds of resident and migratory bird species. However, even when several oceanographic processes that confer a high productivity to the Gulf of California LME have been documented, there is very little field work to monitor these phenomena, such as coastal upwelling in the southern region, as well as the spatial and temporal variability in nutrient concentrations, the effect of exchange with coastal systems and the role of the Gulf of California as a sink or exporter of carbon dioxide (CO2), for example, in winter the region of the Grandes Islas, there are a source of CO2 to the atmosphere (pCO(2) > 580 mu atm). On this, the records show that in the last 250 years the concentrations of atmospheric CO2 in the world have increased and it has been reported that the ocean daily fixed 2.2 metric tons of CO2, this content has changed from 280 mu atm before the industrial revolution to 407 mu atm in recent times. In the Gulf of California, studies conducted on carbon dioxide (air-ocean flow, dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity) are scarce, and suggest a net flow CO2 from coastal waters into the atmosphere mainly in the region of the Grandes Islas, caused by the intense vertical mixing. In the absence of time-series data on the processes occurring in the southern part of the Gulf, it is necessary to start continuous records of temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH vertical structure and the measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity and nutrients to improve understanding of the biogeochemical structure of the water column and possible exchanges with the coast.

JO  - Marine Biology
PY  - 2015
VL  - 162
IS  - 6
AB  - A large percentage of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere is absorbed by the oceans, causing chemical changes in surface waters known as ocean acidification (OA). Despite the high interest and increased pace of OA research to understand the effects of OA on marine organisms, many ecologically important organisms remain unstudied. Calcidiscus is a heavily calcified coccolithophore genus that is widespread and genetically and morphologically diverse. It contributes substantially to global calcium carbonate production, organic carbon production, oceanic carbon burial, and ocean-atmosphere CO2 exchange. Despite the importance of this genus, relatively little work has examined its responses to OA. We examined changes in growth, morphology, and carbon allocation in multiple strains of Calcidiscus leptoporus in response to ocean acidification. We also, for the first time, examined the OA response of Calcidiscus quadriperforatus, a larger and more heavily calcified Calcidiscus congener. All Calcidiscus coccolithophores responded negatively to OA with impaired coccolith morphology and a decreased ratio of particulate inorganic to organic carbon (PIC:POC). However, strains responded variably; C. quadriperforatus showed the most sensitivity, while the most lightly calcified strain of C. leptoporus showed little response to OA. Our findings suggest that calcium carbonate production relative to organic carbon production by Calcidiscus coccolithophores may decrease in future oceans and that Calcidiscus distributions may shift if more resilient strains and species become dominant in assemblages. This study demonstrates that variable responses to OA may be strain or species specific in a way that is closely linked to physiological traits, such as cellular calcite quota.

JO  - City And Environment Interactions
PY  - 2021
VL  - 12
IS  - NA
AB  - Constraining uncertainty in the global carbon cycle requires valid assessment of both surface and stored carbon in marine and coastal ecosystems (Blue Carbon) as well as terrestrial carbon (forests, peatlands, and soils) {[}Pendleton et al., 2012]. Quantifying the global carbon stock of coastal salt marshes, potentially the most efficient carbon-burying ecosystems in the world per area, is a key area of further research in both of these fields Pendleton et al., 2012. One of the largest challenges is that despite the fact that salt marshes often sequester carbon several meters deep, nearly all estimates of salt marsh carbon stocks consider only the upper 1 m of sediment (Windham-Myers et al., 2015) {[}54]. This is particularly concerning because coastal wetlands are increasingly at risk due to climate change, sea level rise, and anthropogenic disturbance and destruction (Deegan et al., 2012) [}15]. Using full-depth measurements from marsh cores, we estimate the carbon stock of five salt marshes in the highly urbanized estuary of Jamaica Bay, New York and argue that partial-depth measurements can underestimate carbon stocks. These estimates use calculated carbon content and probe depth data of these marshes collected between 2000 and 2019, applying this data across the full area of the marsh obtained from satellite imagery. Carbon density measurements are then multiplied by the full-depth volume of the marshes to create an estimate of total carbon stock. In addition to calculating present-day estimates, we compare our carbon stock estimates to historical Jamaica Bay imagery to calculate historical carbon stocks and carbon loss. The carbon stock estimates presented here show a 95\% carbon stock loss between 1885 and 2019 in Jamaica Bay and highlight the severe underestimation of carbon stocks without full-depth calculations. These findings have important implications for disappearing salt marshes with regard to the global carbon cycle and the incorporation of belowground carbon into global climate models. The findings are increasingly relevant for advocacy efforts aiming to conserve these marshes with sea level rise.

VL  - 118
IS  - 4
AB  - Estuarine and coastal wetlands exhibit high rates of carbon burial and storage in anaerobic sediments, but the extent to which carbon sequestration is offset by methane (CH4) emissions from these ecosystems remains unclear. In this study we combine measurements of sediment-air CH4 fluxes with monitoring of belowground CH4 pools in a New Jersey tidal marsh in order to clarify mechanistic links between environmental drivers, subsurface dynamics, and atmospheric emissions. Measurements were conducted in an unvegetated mud flat and adjacent low marsh vegetated with Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis. Pore water measurements throughout the year revealed long-term CH4 storage in mud flat sediments, leading to a seasonal lag in emissions that extended into winter months. CH4 reservoirs and fluxes in vegetated sediments were well described by an empirical temperature-response model, while poor model agreement in unvegetated sediments was attributed to decouplings between production and flux due to storage processes. This study highlights the need to incorporate sediment gas exchange rates and pathways into biogeochemical process models.

AB  - To a certain extent, adhesive bonding of measurement equipment is very common in science and technology, e.g. adhesive bonding of small-scale strain gauges. Adhesive bonding of the entire equipment for a fully autonomous pile driving monitoring of an impact-driven large-scale foundation structure for an offshore wind farm is a completely new application method. Several offshore wind farms are currently under construction in the North and Baltic Seas. Impact pile driving of the large-scale foundations usually causes much louder noise than permitted by regulations, so methods for noise reduction are necessary. Geotechnical engineers of the TU Braunschweig are investigating combined methods for reducing that noise, and in 2014 they had the opportunity to install measurement equipment for the investigation of dynamic pile deflections during pile driving into three of in total eighty monopiles (length: 60Â m, diameter: 6Â m) of an offshore wind farm in the German North Sea. Due to certification issues conventional methods of fastening such as screwing or welding were not permitted. Instead, adhesive bonding of all parts (sensors, cables, shielding, recorder/computer) was successfully applied and withstood impact driving with several thousand blows of up to 1200Â g (earth gravity). The authors would like to present the concept and preceding tests of the adhesive bonding applied within the research project â€˜triadâ€™. Â© 2015, Wisner et al. All Right Reserved.

AB  - Super Grids are large continent-wide expansions of existing and planned high voltage power grids which have been proposed for bulk power transfers across international boundaries and for enhanced stability of underlying power infrastructure. This paper focuses on two such schemes in Europe and Latin America, reviews the architectures, analyses the reasons for the differences, and presents a better understanding on how each topology and its characteristics may be leveraged to plan similar Super Grids in other parts of the globe. Predominantly, proposals for such Super Grids nucleate around extensive application of high voltage direct current (HVDC) technology for long distance power transmission with low losses. Ultra high voltage alternating current (UHVAC), with voltages above 800 kV AC, is also a competing alternative for low losses power transmission. This review paper presents a systematic and practical understanding on what could be the most suitable topology for each power transmission requirement. Â© 2019 IEEE.

AB  - This work proposes an air-core DC-DC solid state transformer to connect the wind turbines of an offshore wind farm in series with a DC transmission link. This emerging layout does not use a power transformer to increase the voltage from the offshore collector network to the transmission level, nor does it require a rectifier station to convert the electrical energy to DC. The diode-clamped rectifiers, connected to each permanent-magnet generator, are controlled to drain sinusoidal currents from the generators in order to extract the maximum power from the wind turbines. The air-core transformer, designed by means of a finite element software, ensures the galvanic isolation between the wind generator and the HVDC link. From the generator side, a single-phase full-bridge three-level inverter feeds the primary coil of the transformer, whereas the secondary coil is wound using by means of an XLPE-insulated cable. This paper also presents a strategy for designing the controllers that regulate the output voltage of each wind conversion unit. Results from digital simulations, obtained with PSCAD/EMTDC, are presented to validate the technical feasibility of the proposed DC-DC solid-state transformer scheme, as well as to demonstrate its performance under different operational conditions.

JO  - Ocean Engineering
PY  - 2019
VL  - 190
IS  - NA
AB  - The increasing economic cost and environmental impact of maritime transportation necessitate the reduction of fossil fuel consumption of ocean-going cargo ships. Although fundamental ship propulsion system theory is well-known and is at a mature stage of development, there is still an enormous variety in the assessment methodology of (environmental) transport performance of ships. Furthermore, calibration of ship propulsion system model parameters with testbed, towing tank and full-scale measurement data is rare, as these measurements are both difficult and expensive. Finally, the effects of different power management strategies on the ultimate energy conversion effectiveness of typical cargo ships have rarely been investigated systematically. In this paper these three issues are discussed, addressed and solved for a representative benchmark chemical tanker. This ship was chosen to investigate the so-called energy conversion effectiveness under various propulsion control and electric power generation modes, as ample real ship data is available. The transport performance assessment of the ship's power plant is generalised for hybrid arrangements with either Power-Take-Off or Power-Take-In. The results show that an optimal combination of propulsion control, power management and voyage planning will further reduce the global fuel consumption and CO2 emissions produced by the shipping industry.

JO  - Proceedings Of The Royal Society B: Biological Sciences
PY  - 2017
VL  - 284
IS  - 1859
AB  - Carbon burial is increasingly valued as a service provided by threatened vegetated coastal habitats. Similarly, shellfish reefs contain significant pools of carbon and are globally endangered, yet considerable uncertainty remains regarding shellfish reefsâ€™ role as sources (+) or sinks (-) of atmospheric CO2. While CO2 release is a by-product of carbonate shell production (then burial), shellfish also facilitate atmospheric-CO2 drawdown via filtration and rapid biodeposition of carbon-fixing primary producers. We provide a framework to account for the dual burial of inorganic and organic carbon, and demonstrate that decade-old experimental reefs on intertidal sandflats were net sources of CO2 (7.1 Â± 1.2 MgC ha-1 yr-1 (m Â± s.e.)) resulting from predominantly carbonate deposition, whereas shallow subtidal reefs (-1.0 Â± 0.4 MgC ha-1 yr-1) and saltmarsh-fringing reefs (-1.3 Â± 0.4 MgC ha-1 yr-1) were dominated by organic-carbon-rich sediments and functioned as net carbon sinks (on par with vegetated coastal habitats). These landscape-level differences reflect gradients in shellfish growth, survivorship and shell bioerosion. Notably, down-core carbon concentrations in 100- to 4000-year-old reefs mirrored experimental-reef data, suggesting our results are relevant over centennial to millennial scales, although we note that these natural reefs appeared to function as slight carbon sources (0.5 Â± 0.3 MgC ha-1 yr-1). Globally, the historical mining of the top metre of shellfish reefs may have reintroduced more than 400 000 000 Mg of organic carbon into estuaries. Importantly, reef formation and destruction do not have reciprocal, counterbalancing impacts on atmospheric CO2 since excavated organic material may be remineralized while shell may experience continued preservation through reburial. Thus, protection of existing reefs could be considered as one component of climate mitigation programmes focused on the coastal zone. Â© 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Focus is paid to a monopile used as foundation for a wind turbine at Horns Rev located in the Danish sector of the North Sea. The outer diameter of the pile is 4 m and the subsoil at the location consists primarily of sand.

AB  - Due to the fact that the emissions is a very important and challenging issue in our world today, especially for the shipping industry, so the use of more environmental friendly fuels in marine engines has become very attractive among researchers. The most interesting and promising alternative fuel is hydrogen (H2) and extensive research on feasible production and developing advance reliable consumption methods is ongoing. In this paper, the implication of hydrogen and performance of the propulsion system of a very large crude carrier is studied, by considering the speed required for the relevant marine voyage cycle to investigate and assessed when fuel is partially switched from diesel to hydrogen. Through developing an advance code in the Matlab-Simulink software, the effect of hydrogen percentage from 1 % to 10 % on CO2 emission and propulsion performance is assessed for the proposed marine voyage and the results are compared with the case of natural gas/diesel or solely conventional diesel. The modeling prediction indicates that by changing the composition of fuels used, at the same time trying to maintain the same power output and proper performance of the engine and propulsion system, the amount of CO2 emission could significantly be reduced, up to 10 % or even more than 24 % in the cases that the energy share of hydrogen and natural gas is 10 % and 99 % for dual fuel hydrogen/diesel and dual fuel natural gas/diesel engines, respectively.

AB  - Sea wave power may help to solve the problem of energy crisis of the world with pollution free environment. Low cost and efficient electric power generation is main challenge in this sector. In this research work a linear generator has been characterized to find optimum condition in the laboratory environment. A machine named simple harmonic oscillator has been used in our laboratory as alternate of the sea wave. The electric power of the linear generator has been increased with turn's number of the induction coil and frequency of the coil oscillation. In a series of magnets the arrangement of 2 cm gap between the magnets gives the maximum output for the bobbin length 3 cm that was interested. Repulsion arrangement of the magnets is relatively better. The ferromagnetic core increases the electric power. Considering all above arrangement it is expected that an efficient and low cost power plant may be developed by the linear generator.

AB  - As a step in investigating the possibility of storing CO2 in the deep sea, simulations on sedimentation of CO2 or CO2 clathrate were performed with consideration for dissolution. (1) In the case that CO2 is injected into the sea, it is necessary to inject CO2 at an extremely close point to the sea bottom, because CO2 is dissolved and diffused into the sea in a short time and it will affect the characteristics of the sea water in the vicinty of the injected point. (2) If the difference between injected depth and expected depth for clathrate storage is small, some part of the injected clathrate will be stored at the sea bottom, and then it is diffused into the sea to affect the characteristics of the sea water in the vicinity of the sea bottom. If the differnce is large, all injected clathrates are dissolved into sea water. Then it is expected that the effect of clathrate injection on the environment of deep sea would be small because the dissolved CO2 is diluted into the sea at each depth. (3) In the case that CO2 is stored at the sea bottom, it is necessary to be stored in a hollow place where CO2 is not dissolved into the sea from stored CO2 by diffusion on the basis of current flow, and pH is not partially increased to affect the vicinity in the neighborhood of stored place.

AB  - Maritime shipping represents a valuable and economical mode of international cargo transportation. Also maritime transport operates from combustion of fossil fuels which represents a substantial part of the total greenhouse gas emission and contributes significant amounts of greenhouse gases (GHG) associated with global warming. International Maritime Organization has developed technical and operational measures to control the CO2 emissions from ships and additionally vessels today are designed with better energy efficiency. An important operational management aspect is slow steaming where as an action on ship intentionally reduces vessel service speed and results the reduction of fuel costs. This paper investigates the relationship and impact among slow steaming cost reduction and furthermore the carbon emission reduction, shipment delay and dangerous anchoring due to ports limitations, through the evaluation with Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution. This method represents a multi-criteria decision analysis method and is a useful tool for decision makers facing multi criteria processes in order to investigate the value of an alternative compared with the ideal solution. It also evaluates the decisions that should be taken into consideration from the ships managers for the most advantageous operation of the ship. Â© 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

AB  - This paper presents the results of an electromagnetic design and numerical analysis conducted on a 10-MW-class second-generation high-temperature superconducting generator (2G HTSG) used in an offshore wind power turbine. To report the operation reliability of 10-MW-class HTSGs employed in offshore environment, various electric insulation techniques (EITs) for HTS field coils (FCs), such as no-insulation, metal insulation, and metal-insulator transition insulation, are considered in this study. Using the time-transient solver of the three-dimensional (3D) electromagnetic finite element analysis (FEA), we investigated the electromagnetic characteristics of the HTSG with the three EITs in terms of the electrical output of the HTSG and the critical current of the FCs. To analyze the charging characteristic of the HTS FCs with the three EITs in steady-state operation as well as the electrical in transient-state operation, electric equivalent circuit models are built with key parameters based on the electromagnetic FEA results. Finally, the performances of the HTS FCs are discussed and evaluated in terms of the electromagnetic response and stability characteristics. Â© 2002-2011 IEEE.

TI  - Power System Design Optimization for a Ferry Using Hybrid-Shaft Generators
JO  - Ieee Transactions On Power Systems
PY  - 2022
VL  - 37
IS  - 4
AB  - Ferry contributing a significant amount of greenhouse gas is one of the critical vessels to be electrified. Designing a power system for a ferry with hybrid-shaft generators is different from designing a power system for other vessels because of its fixed route. More clearly, ferries repeatedly travel between their port of origin and port of destination, and before the next voyage, the battery must be recharged to the initial state so that the optimal energy management scheme can be repeatedly applied. Furthermore, the flexibility of hybrid-shaft generators, which allow more fuel saving, increases design complexity. In this paper, a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem is first formulated, and a power management algorithm with an initialization step for fulfilling the battery recharging requirement and a refinement step for minimizing the fuel consumption is proposed. The simulation results obtained from data of an actual ferry show that the proposed power management algorithm can fully recharge the battery and consumes less fuel than a rule-based power management scheme. Simulations also reveal that fuel consumption depends on available shore power, highlighting the necessity to develop charging infrastructure for practical electrification. Because of its speed, the algorithm can support hardware sizing, e.g., battery sizing.

TI  - Reductions in cost and greenhouse gas emissions with new bulk ship designs enabled by the Panama Canal expansion
JO  - Energy Policy
PY  - 2013
VL  - 59
IS  - NA
AB  - Historically, fuel costs have been small compared with the fixed costs of a bulk vessel, its crewing and management. Today, however, fuel accounts for more than 50% of the total costs. In combination with an introduction of stricter energy efficiency requirements for new vessels, this might make design improvement a necessity for all new bulk vessels. This is in contradiction to traditional bulk vessel designs, where the focus has been on maximizing the cargo-carrying capacity at the lowest possible building cost and not on minimizing the energy consumption. Moreover, the Panama Canal has historically been an important design criterion, while the new canal locks from 2014 will significantly increase the maximum size of vessels that can pass. The present paper provides an assessment of cost and emissions as a function of alternative bulk vessel designs with focus on a vessel's beam, length and hull slenderness, expressed by the length displacement ratio for three fuel price scenarios. The result shows that with slenderer hull forms the emissions drop. With today's fuel price of 600. USD per ton of fuel, emissions can thus be reduced by up to 15-25% at a negative abatement cost.

TI  - Carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus budgets for a shallow subtropical coastal embayment (Moreton Bay, Australia)
JO  - Limnology And Oceanography
PY  - 2002
VL  - 47
IS  - 4
AB  - Average annual carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus budgets were constructed for Moreton Bay. Primary production was the dominant source of carbon (by two orders of magnitude), N fixation was the dominant source of nitrogen, and point sources were the dominant source of phosphorus to the bay. About 41\% of the nitrogen and 70\% of the phosphorus entering Moreton Bay was exported to the ocean, and about 56\% of the nitrogen was lost to denitrification. The high percentage loss of phosphorus to the ocean was directly related to the short residence time of the bay (46 d), which was consistent with other shallow coastal ecosystems. In contrast, the percentage loss of nitrogen to the ocean was low compared to other coastal systems due to the high percentage loss through denitrification associated with autotrophic sediments in the bay that enhance denitrification. Because most denitrification studies have been carried out using only dark incubations, the importance of denitrification to the nitrogen budgets of coastal systems in general may be underestimated. Carbon loss from Moreton Bay was dominated (by two orders of magnitude) by atmospheric exchange of CO, associated with benthic and pelagic respiration. The distinct difference between Moreton Bay (subtropical) and temperate systems was the dominance of biological (microbial: N fixation and denitrification) over physical inputs and losses of nitrogen. High N fixation in turn fuels a positive annual mean net ecosystem metabolism (NEM) of 21 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and suggests that primary production in the bay is phosphorus limited at the whole ecosystem scale.

AB  - The shipping sector decarbonisation has attracted great attention due to the sector contribution to worldwide carbon emissions. This study aims at investigating the techno-economic- environmental performance of different ship power plants to identify sustainable solutions for a case study cargo ship. Four scenarios, considering conventional and hybrid power plants, the latter with installed batteries, both using marine gas oil and ammonia fuels, are analysed to estimate the pertinent lifetime key performance indicators characterising their economic and environmental performance. Additionally, taxation schemes of varying extent are considered, and a sensitivity analysis is carried out on the most uncertain input parameters, namely, fuel prices and capital cost. This study results demonstrate that the hybrid plant using ammonia exhibits the lowest environmental footprint associated with 66\% carbon emission reduction, whilst increasing the lifetime cost by 40\%. Taxation schemes close to 340 EUR per CO2 tonne are required to render it economically viable whilst meeting the IMO targets for 2050 on CO(2 )emissions reduction. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the economic parameters is highly sensitive to fuel price and the capital expenditure.

AB  - In recent years, with the development of shipping industry, the mass of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions originating from ships is also increasing rapidly. To reduce the GHG emissions from ships, designing the optimised routes with higher energy use efficiency is becoming more important for ships navigating in short seas. Based on the innovative application of energy efficiency operational index (EEOI), a route optimisation model is established. To solve the model, we divide one single voyage into several voyage segments and consider the variable speed across voyage segments. Then the navigation strategy is used to find out the sailing route of the minimum EEOI value, this sailing route is called as the green route. Finally, numerical experimental results show that the EEOI values of the experimental groups which used the optimised navigation method are 4.67\%-16.95\% lower than that of the control group. The results demonstrate that the green route designed in this paper can effectively improve the energy use efficiency of ships.

AB  - This article, as far as possible based on the available literature, empirical measurements, and data from mesoscale models describes and compares expected wind conditions within the Baltic Sea area. This article refers to aspects related to the design and assessment of wind farm wind resources, based on the author's previous experience related to onshore wind energy. The consecutive chapters of this publication are going to describe the present state and the presumptions relating to the development of wind energy within the Baltic Sea area. Subsequently, the potential of the sea was assessed using mesoscale models and empirical data from the Fino 2 mast that is located approximately 200 kilometers away from the majority of areas indicated in the Polish marine spatial development plan draft of Poland for offshore wind farm development (Maritime Office in Gdynia 2018). In the chapter describing mesoscale models, the author focused his attention on the GEOS5.12.4 model as the source of Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application 2 data, also known as MERRA2 (Administration National Aeronautics and Space Agency, 28), which, starting from February 2016, replaced MERRA data (Thogersen et al. 2016) and have gained a wide scope of applications in the assessment of pre-investment and operational productivity due to a remarkable level of correlation with in-situ data. Model-specific data has been obtained for eight locations, which largely overlap with the locations of the currently existing offshore wind farms within the Baltic Sea area. A significant part of this publication is going to be devoted to the description of the previously mentioned Fino 2 mast and to the analysis of data recorded until the end of 2014 by using the said mast (Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency 2018). The analysis has been carried out by means using scripts made in the VBA programming language, making it easier to work with large chunks of data. Measurements from the Fino 2 mast, together with long-term mesoscale model-specific measurements can be used, to some extent, for the preliminary assessment of wind farm energy yield in the areas designated for the development of renewable energy in the Polish exclusive maritime economic zone (Maritime Office in Gdynia 2018). In the final part of this article, pieces of information on the forecasted Baltic Sea wind conditions, especially within the exclusive economic zone of Poland, are going to be summarized. A major focus is going to be put on the differences between offshore and onshore wind energy sources, as well as on further aspects, which should be examined in order to optimize the offshore wind power development.

AB  - IMO is introducing two different emission indexes for a vessel: the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI). Both EEDI and EEOI will be probably used as part of a levy scheme to force the maritime sector to significantly reduce the carbon footprint. At present do exist few ports and/or states applying fees based on ship emissions. The reliability of a regular shipping service, or service reliability, defined as the probability to complete the link within schedule, is an important parameter that greatly influences commercial aspects, as well as the ship carbon footprint. In this paper the authors present a procedure to evaluate the EEOI indicator by Monte Carlo simulation, estimating the total ship fuel consumption as a function of the random variables displacement and speed. A complete series of operating data concerning two years of navigation, for a commercial trade in the Mediterranean Sea, were collected and used to validate the code.

AB  - In addition to the largest existing expanse of tropical forests, the Brazilian Amazon has among the largest area of mangroves in the world. While recognized as important global carbon sinks that, when disturbed, are significant sources of greenhouse gases, no studies have quantified the carbon stocks of these vast mangrove forests. In this paper, we quantified total ecosystem carbon stocks of mangroves and salt marshes east of the mouth of the Amazon River, Brazil. Mean ecosystem carbon stocks of the salt marshes were 257 Mg C ha(-1) while those of mangroves ranged from 361 to 746 Mg C ha(-1). Although aboveground mass was high relative to many other mangrove forests (145 Mg C ha(-1)), soil carbon stocks were relatively low (340 Mg C ha(-1)). Low soil carbon stocks may be related to coarse textured soils coupled with a high tidal range. Nevertheless, the carbon stocks of the Amazon mangroves were over twice those of upland evergreen forests and almost 10-fold those of tropical dry forests.

An optimized energy management system is proposed to control the microgrid power flow with the objective of minimizing the CO2 emission from the supporting MGT while exploiting the flexibility of control of the specific storage technology to achieve high efficiency and large energy capacity. The novelty relies on a mixed use of techniques, some of which typical of energy system planning and other of primary controls, because currently the grid under study only operates on 2 MGTs and we had to provide the comprehensive solution to verify how to decarbonize such services for the near future, along with its economics.

The controller parameters of both rectifier and inverter will have a great impact on both the system itself and the other parts of the transmission system due to the connection of DC transmission line. Usually, the controller parameters on each side are designed and tested separately. Therefore, the performance of the whole system can hardly achieve the best operation state. In this paper, a new method of coordinated optimization considering DC line is proposed. A united transfer function model is also established. Then, according to ITAE (integral of time multiplied by the absolute value of error) criterion, the parameters of both converters are optimized simultaneously. Simulation results verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed optimization method. Â© 2015 IEEE.

JO  - Limnology And Oceanography
PY  - 2022
VL  - 67
IS  - 2, SI
AB  - Climate change has created a need for solutions that can counteract greenhouse gas emissions. One is the expansion and maintenance of natural carbon (C)-sequestration habitats, such as forests and coastal and marine vegetated ecosystems, socalled ``blue carbon ecosystems{'' including salt marshes, which represent large and long-term C-storage potential. While salt marsh blue carbon is gaining international attention, Baltic and Nordic salt marshes have been neglected in the blue carbon context. Here, we quantified C-stocks and C-sequestration rates in grazed and nongrazed sites of three Danish salt marshes, and evaluated whether grazing livestock, the standard management to increase biodiversity of the marshes, affect C-stocks and sequestration rates. The aboveground biomass and vegetation height in nongrazed salt marshes were significantly larger than for grazed salt marshes, but this did not lead to significantly enhanced overall sediment- or C-accumulation rates. Detailed model analyses of sediment profiles even indicated significantly higher C-densities in surface layers at grazed sites. Averaged C-densities, C-stocks (top 43 cm sediment) and sequestration rates estimated from Pb-210 profiles ranged 0.011-0.022 g C cm(-3), 4228-8178 g C m(-2), and 17-45 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively, with the latter being low in the global context. While this pioneering study for the Baltic and Nordic regions showed a neutral to positive effect of grazing on C-sequestration, there is a need to explore the overall C-footprint of this practice, including effects on net greenhouse gas emissions and coastal defense capacity, and define blue carbon management strategies for salt marshes to maximize their climate change mitigation and adaptation capacity while supporting biodiversity.

JO  - International Shipbuilding Progress
PY  - 2020
VL  - 67
IS  - 1
AB  - One of the major challenges facing the maritime sector today is the transition to zero emission carbon-neutral vessels. In particular, work vessels such as dredging vessels are required to operate worldwide and under heavy conditions. These vessels have a high power density, limited on-board space, require often a large autonomy, and therefore will need very energy dense fuels. This article presents an environmental and economic assessment of four cutter suction dredger drive system design alternatives with the life cycle performance assessment tool. This tool includes the most important environmental factors as well as the net present value. The effect of emission costs and fuel price developments may be taken into account with scenarios, and this article illustrates that they have a large effect on the economic viability of future zero emission vessels. A combination of clean fuels, new prime mover technologies, efficient design and effective system integration has the potential to achieve zero emissions while maintaining the vessels' functionality. However, technology alone cannot solve the complex challenge of energy transition in the maritime sector. In order to make zero emission designs economically viable, a system wide integration is needed, meaning cooperation in the value chain and effective policies. Â© 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - This paper describes a method to reduce cost and improve efficiency of offshore wind farms. The method employs the use of dual, counter-rotating blades equipped with special tubercle clad blades. Power is transmitted from the blade assembly to the platform deck via a 90Â° magnetic translating system. The generator, transformer, switchgear and controls are mounted at deck level; hence the weight and footprint of the nacelle are greatly reduced. The Advanced Offshore Wind System also employs a tri-pod tower unit and caisson support structure. The vertical-mounted power transmission shaft is constructed of a carbon composite material having steel bearing areas. The result of the various components operating as a unit greatly reduces cost, lowers maintenance cost and provides more deliverable power than conventional offshore wind systems.

AB  - The combination of wave and aerodynamic loads acting on Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWT) creates a complex system that must be studied in detail to harness as much energy possible while maintaining structural integrity. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a useful analysis tool, which enables to consider the key parameters (e.g., mooring line forces, wave characteristics, aerodynamic loads) and, thus, help in the design process. However, its computational cost is often prohibitive. For this reason, simplifications must typically be introduced. In this paper, simulations of heave decay tests, with and without moorings, under regular waves were compared with experimental data obtained from previous studies carried out by Saitec Offshore Technologies in the MaREI Centre (Ireland).

AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) is, next to water vapour, considered to be the most important natural greenhouse gas on Earth. Rapidly rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations caused by human actions such as fossil fuel burning, land-use change or cement production over the past 250 years have given cause for concern that changes in Earth's climate system may progress at a much faster pace and larger extent than during the past 20 000 years. Investigating global carbon cycle pathways and finding suitable adaptation and mitigation strategies has, therefore, become of major concern in many research fields. The oceans have a key role in regulating atmospheric CO2 concentrations and currently take up about 25% of annual anthropogenic carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Questions that yet need to be answered are what the carbon uptake kinetics of the oceans will be in the future and how the increase in oceanic carbon inventory will affect its ecosystems and their services. This requires comprehensive investigations, including high-quality ocean carbon measurements on different spatial and temporal scales, the management of data in sophisticated databases, the application of Earth system models to provide future projections for given emission scenarios as well as a global synthesis and outreach to policy makers. In this paper, the current understanding of the ocean as an important carbon sink is reviewed with respect to these topics. Emphasis is placed on the complex interplay of different physical, chemical and biological processes that yield both positive and negative air-sea flux values for natural and anthropogenic CO2 as well as on increased CO2 (uptake) as the regulating force of the radiative warming of the atmosphere and the gradual acidification of the oceans. Major future ocean carbon challenges in the fields of ocean observations, modelling and process research as well as the relevance of other biogeochemical cycles and greenhouse gases are discussed.

TI  - Low-ILUC biofuel production in marginal areas: Can existing EU policies support biochar deployment in EU MED arid lands under desertification?
JO  - Chemical Engineering Transactions
PY  - 2018
VL  - 65
IS  - NA
AB  - Arid lands in EU MED areas are increasing in extension year by year, as it is well documented by many studies of International Institutions (as EC-JRC, EEA, etc). EU MED farmers face the dramatic effects of extended drought conditions, that combined with extreme phenomena as floodings or thunderstorms make economic profitability of agriculture very low or even negative. This is associated with a clearly increasing abandonment rate of agricultural land in EU. The most EU critical areas are located in Spain, but also Greece, Italy and Portugal, as well as in the non-EU Southern rim of the MED basin. Biochar could represent an effective approach to fight desertification, together with other agronomic practices which can vary depending on the specific location or crops. Biochar can be cheaply produced from residual biomass through processes such as slow pyrolysis or hydrothermal carbonization, and its combination with compost obtained from the Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (OFMSW) or digestate from anaerobic digestion can offer both a short and a medium-to-long term effect in dryland agriculture. These lands, that otherwise would inevitably leave the active utilisation in conventional agriculture, would be suitable for energy crop cultivation, as drought resistant oil crop, well meeting the latest indications in the EC REDII proposal. Through biochar (and derived product) application, the loss of Utilised Agricultural Land in EU MED drylands can be prevented. From the policy side, it thus makes sense to investigate if existing policies are sufficient to facilitate the wide market deployment of biochar, or if new instruments are needed. Our analysis demonstrates that currently operational EU policies, could be well used to implement biochar related actions in arid lands. However, most often these measures are not transferred into concrete programmes at regional level, especially in the agricultural sector. In fact, EU and Member States already have quite a large number of instruments that can directly or indirectly support actions targeted to increase the resilience of these arid lands to Climate Change, generating a significant impact on the environmental and socio-economic situation. Policy should support initiatives that can provide clear evidences, be cost- and environmentally-effective, and adapted to local conditions. The present work investigated EU/MS policies that could potentially support the improvement of soil resilience to climate change in EU MED region, by enabling widespread diffusion of biochar. The EU legislative elements that were considered are the EU agricultural policy, the EU Carbon sequestration & storage policy (seen in the framework of the COP21 agreement and its core goals), and the EU renewable energy policy, even if others would also apply. We considered sunflower cultivation in dry land of Central area (Tuscany) of Italy. Results showed that marginal land could be seen as an opportunity to produce low-ILUC biofuels (as mentioned in the EC REDII proposed Directive), without conflicting with food production or generating negative effects on GHG emissions. The Long-term storage of C in the soil through biochar would perfectly match with the Climate strategy defined at International level (Paris COP21 and following). Soil, after ocean, is the second most abundant C sink: Paris-COP21 called for C-negative actions (and not just C-neutral ones). In this respect, the proposed approach would perfectly match with EU (ETS) and International (COP21) policy for the coming decades. Copyright Â© 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

TI  - Geoengineering impact of open ocean dissolution of olivine on atmospheric CO2, surface ocean pH and marine biology
JO  - Environmental Research Letters
PY  - 2013
VL  - 8
IS  - 1
AB  - Ongoing global warming induced by anthropogenic emissions has opened the debate as to whether geoengineering is a `quick fix' option. Here we analyse the intended and unintended effects of one specific geoengineering approach, which is enhanced weathering via the open ocean dissolution of the silicate-containing mineral olivine. This approach would not only reduce atmospheric CO2 and oppose surface ocean acidification, but would also impact on marine biology. If dissolved in the surface ocean, olivine sequesters 0.28 g carbon per g of olivine dissolved, similar to land-based enhanced weathering. Silicic acid input, a byproduct of the olivine dissolution, alters marine biology because silicate is in certain areas the limiting nutrient for diatoms. As a consequence, our model predicts a shift in phytoplankton species composition towards diatoms, altering the biological carbon pumps. Enhanced olivine dissolution, both on land and in the ocean, therefore needs to be considered as ocean fertilization. From dissolution kinetics we calculate that only olivine particles with a grain size of the order of 1 mu m sink slowly enough to enable a nearly complete dissolution. The energy consumption for grinding to this small size might reduce the carbon sequestration efficiency by similar to 30\%.

AB  - The present work shows the design of a mesoscopic low-power hydrokinetic turbine (160 cm in diameter). We analyze the relationship between the density of the fluid and the speed of the California Current with respect to the energy that is captured by the turbine due to the design. A critical factor in the implementation of the turbine on this scale is the design of the blades, which must withstand the loads generated by the force of the tides and the conditions of the marine environment (salinity, cavitation phenomena along the body of the blades, among others). A free code program based on a Matlab environment was used for the optimization of the blade and in ANSYS Fluent the drag and lift coefficient values were analyzed for a selected profile. The turbine elements were designed in Solid Works. When the current speed is maximum, we achieve a final electrical power of 4.5kW, approximately.

JO  - Nature Communications
PY  - 2022
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
AB  - The sediment-water interface in the coastal ocean is a highly dynamic zone controlling biogeochemical fluxes of greenhouse gases, nutrients, and metals. Processes in the sediment mixed layer (SML) control the transfer and reactivity of both particulate and dissolved matter in coastal interfaces. Here we map the global distribution of the coastal SML based on excess Pb-210 (Pb-210(ex)) profiles and then use a neural network model to upscale these observations. We show that highly dynamic regions such as large estuaries have thicker SMLs than most oceanic sediments. Organic carbon preservation and SMLs are inversely related as mixing stimulates oxidation in sediments which enhances organic matter decomposition. Sites with SML thickness >60 cm usually have lower organic carbon accumulation rates (<50 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and total organic carbon/specific surface area ratios (<0.4 mg m(-2)). Our global scale observations reveal that reworking can accelerate organic matter degradation and reduce carbon storage in coastal sediments. The authors map the global distribution of the mixed layer in coastal ocean sediments, based on a neural network model. These observations reveal that mixing can accelerate organic matter degradation and reduce carbon storage in the coastal ocean.

AB  - The maritime institutions aim at contributing to reducing the adverse effects arising from the ships, machinery operation through the possibilities exit in the engine room simulators. The current paper explains the importance of engine room simulators in maritime education in general and focuses on their use in the field of evaluation and management of machinery within the engine room space. As a case study, an electric powered passenger ship and an oil tanker ship are investigated regarding applying ship energy management onboard. This investigation could be achieved using the possibilities available in TRANSIS ERS 5000. With reference to passenger ships, the results show the possibility of saving energy with a reduction of CO, SOx, CO2 and C emissions by about 7.97, 10.54, 12.36, and 20.11%, respectively. However, regarding tanker ships, the results reveal that a reduction of speed by 10% will achieve fuel saving by about 25%. Â© 2019: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects

AB  - Seagrass meadows have long been recognized for their high ecological and economic value. More recently, a potential role in climate regulation due to their ability to fix and sequester carbon has been the focus of intensive study. In the Mediterranean Sea, the matte, a specific structure constructed by the seagrass Posidonia oceanica is of particular interest because it keeps buried for thousands of years massive amounts of carbon. In order to study construction process of the matte and to quantify the carbon stocks it sequesters, 12 cores (mean: 2.0 m, maximum: 3.6 m height) were taken at the Natura 2000 site of the Grand Herbier de la CÃ´te Orientale in Corsica. Samples were taken at 10 to 40 m water depth using a Kullenberg corer during the CARBONSINK oceanographic cruise aboard R/V Lâ€ŸEurope (August 2018). The actual matte thickness was compared with HR seismic reflection data for calibration and to characterize the organic carbon content. The mean thickness of the matte was estimated to be 2.1 m and 3 626 years BP old, yielding a mean accretion rate of 0.58 mm year-1. However, the average accretion rate, based on steady matte growth, does not always correspond to reality and several interruptions of growth were observed within the matte structure. The matte constitutes a valuable biological archive containing information regarding the evolution of both the terrestrial and the coastal Corsican ecosystems. Charcoal fragments or pollen grains are some examples of proxies stored in the matte that, in these cases, can provide information on fire episodes in Corsica or on long-term changes in the vegetation on the island, respectively.

AB  - To mitigate climate change due to international shipping, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) requires shipowners and ship technical managers to improve the energy efficiency of ships' operations. This paper studies how voyage planning and execution decisions affect energy efficiency and distinguishes between the commercial and nautical components of energy efficiency. Commercial decisions for voyage planning depend on dynamic market conditions and matter more for energy efficiency than nautical decisions do for voyage execution. The paper identifies the people involved in decision-making processes and advances the energy-efficiency literature by revealing the highly networked nature of agency for energy efficiency. The IMO's current energy efficiency regulations fail to distinguish between the commercial and nautical aspects of energy efficiency, which limits the ability to mitigate climate change through regulatory measures. Policymakers should expand their regulatory focus beyond shipowners and technical managers to cargo owners to improve energy efficiency and reduce maritime transport emissions.

AB  - Owing to the emergent trends in Arctic shipping, different market and policy-based measures would be considered to minimize the negative impacts from vessel-based emissions to the fragile Arctic sea environment. This study analyzes the effectiveness of enforcing HFO-banned areas and emission tax for the environmental sustainability of Arctic shipping. The locations of potential HFO-banned areas are analyzed with an optimization model to minimize the total emissions and cost separately and three scenarios are analyzed with free-ice, medium-ice, and heavy-ice conditions based on daily ice-thickness data obtained from the Arctic Data ArchiveTOPAZ4 system. The analysis is done for a voyage from Asia to Europe and vessel speeds and location data are gathered from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). Vessel-based emissions are estimated following the IMO fourth GHGs study in 2020 which incorporates the vessel's engine load, propulsive power demanded at different speeds, and fuel consumption with auxiliary engines and boilers, among others. A spatial variation of the selected HFO-banned areas is observed when changing ice conditions while producing different levels of CO2, CH4, N2O, BC, and SOx emissions. Although the enforcement of HFO-banned areas and emission tax reduces the total emissions, it significantly increases the total cost of the voyage. The medium-ice condition generates the least emission level and significantly different results are derived from environmental and economic objectives with all scenarios.

AB  - The total useful wave resource around the world is estimated to be larger than 2 TW. Harvesting a small portion of the available wave energy resource could contribute significantly to meet the urgent energy demand. Therefore, a lot of wave energy converters have been developed in the past decades. Traditionally, air turbine, hydroelectric motor and linear electromagnetic motor are used in wave energy converters as the power takeoff system. Although these power takeoffs have their own advantages, power takeoffs are still recognized as the most important challenge in ocean wave energy technology. In this paper, a mechanical motion rectifier (MMR) based power takeoff system is proposed and prototyped for wave energy converter. This power takeoff system can convert the bi-directional wave motion into unidirectional rotation of the generator by integrating two one-way clutches into a rack pinion system. A 500W prototype which contains a heaving buoy and MMR-based power takeoff system was designed and fabricated. The models of power takeoff system and the corresponding single-buoy wave energy converter are built and analyzed. Lab testing of power takeoff mechanism and ocean testing of the overall ocean wave converter system are also conducted. Copyright Â© 2015 by ASME.

JO  - Journal Of Ship Production And Design
PY  - 2016
VL  - 32
IS  - 4
AB  - Traditionally, offshore support vessels have been designed to ensure that they can perform their duties at nearly any sea state. This has been achieved through multiple engines and advanced dynamic positioning systems. This in combination with high safety standards set by the oil companies has resulted in a general operational pattern with vessels running multiple engines at low-to-medium loads to be prepared for unexpected incidents to happen at any time. At medium-to-high power, the combustion engine produces each kilowatt hour with the lowest fuel consumption and the lowest emissions. When engines operate at low power, fuel consumption per kilowatt hour produced increases. For the cost of the operation, this increase in specific fuel consumption at lower loads makes a small impact compared to the total cost of the operation, while for emissions low loads implies that emissions of exhaust gases such as nitrogen oxides and aerosols such as black carbon increases rapidly due to less favorable combustion conditions. This study investigates potential emission and fuel consumption reductions, which can be achieved by introduction of hybrid technologies including their climate mitigation potential. In this context, hybrid means engines of different sizes, battery storage of energy to take peak power requirements, and power management systems with a more balanced focus on reducing emissions and energy consumption while maintaining a high safety standard. Our results indicate that hybrid technologies reduce both emissions and fuel consumption, and that the climate impact of the emission reduction is much larger than the impact due to the reduction in fuel consumption alone.

Although many wave energy conversion devices are unidirectional, the symmetrical, dome-shaped ``Shallow Surf Ramp{''} (SSR) is efficiently capable of capturing each of these wave systems simultaneously, while converting the available wave energy into relatively steady electrical power, and transmitting it to shore for grid distribution. Significant deficiencies in the wave resource have been noted to occur as often as several days in succession ten and 10 days each summer month. The SSR concept can provide efficient capture of a wide range of wave energy that can be used to offset these deficient wave resource days.

AB  - There is a constant need for the reduction of operational and maintenance costs of Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS). The most efficient way of reducing these costs would be to continuously monitor the condition of these systems, which allows for early detection of the degeneration of the generator health, facilitating a proactive response, minimizing downtime, and maximizing productivity. Wind generators are also inaccessible since they are situated on extremely high towers, which are usually 70m more in height. There are also plans to increase the number of offshore sites increasing the need for a remote means of WECS monitoring that overcomes some of the difficulties of accessibility problems. Therefore it is important of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis in WECS. A monitoring scheme of transfer its monitor status with AJAX technology was put forwords in this paper. A remote condition monitoring platform (RCMP) was designed and constructed in this project. And its result brings us an effective solution to deal with the WECS condition monitoring.

AB  - A wind farm, mainly, is composed of a set of turbines, one or more transmitters and a set of electrical cable connections between turbines and transmitters. Determination of turbine locations within the farm to maximize total power generation is called turbine location (TL) problem. Relative turbine positions affect the amount of overall energy because of wake effects. Determination of cable connections among turbines and transmitters to collect produced energy by turbines at transmitters is called cable layout (CL) problem. While TL problem is directly effective on the total energy production in the farm, CL problem indirectly affects the total energy due to the power losses. In the literature, TL and CL problems are solved sequentially where the layout found by solving of TL is used as an input of CL problem. To minimize wake effects in TL problem, distances between turbine pairs should be increased, however, as the distances are increased the cable cost increases in CL problem. A new mathematical model is developed to deal with simultaneously solving of TL and CL problems. A set of test instances are used to show the performance of the proposed model. The experiments show the practical use of the proposed holistic model. Â© 2019 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

AB  - Coastal wetlands offer many important ecosystem services both in natural and in social systems. How to simultaneously decrease the destructive effects flowing from human activities and maintaining the sustainability of regional wetland ecosystems are an important issue for coastal wetlands zones. We use carbon credits as the basis for regional sustainable developing policy-making. With the case of Gouqi Island, a typical coastal wetlands zone that locates in the East China Sea, a carbon cycle model was developed to illustrate the complex social-ecological processes. Carbon-related processes in natural ecosystem, primary industry, secondary industry, tertiary industry, and residents on the island were identified in the model. The model showed that 36780 tons of carbon is released to atmosphere with the form of CO2, and 51240 tons of carbon is captured by the ecosystem in 2014 and the three major resources of carbon emission are transportation and tourism development and seawater desalination. Based on the carbon-related processes and carbon balance, we proposed suggestions on the sustainable development strategy of Gouqi Island as coastal wetlands zone.

AB  - In this study, the use of methanol is proposed as an alternative fuel to comply with the international maritime organization (IMO) emission regulations. Environmental and economic analysis of the methanol-diesel dual fuel engine is carried out. As a case study, cellular container ship is investigated. The results show environmental benefits for reducing NOx, SOx, CO, CO2, and PM emissions by 76.78\%, 89\%, 55\%, 18.13\%, and 82.56\%, respectively. In order to reduce the dual fuel cost to the cost of the diesel fuel at maximum continuous rating (MCR), the ship speed should be reduced by 28\%. In addition, the currently operated diesel engine uses selective catalytic reduction method (SCR) to comply with the IMO emission regulations. Combining the benefits of ship slow steaming and the saved SCR costs, the cost-effectiveness of dual-fuel engine for reducing NOx, CO, and CO2 emissions will be 385.2 \$/ton, 6548 \$/ton, and 39.9 \$/ton, respectively.

It leads to the high increasing of fuel consumption for ship operation on the ocean. Moreover, in 2010, International Maritime Organization (IMO) introduced Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) as a technical measure to limit pollution of the environment resulted by marine engines [1]. EEDI is expressed by CO2 gram per ship's capacity. So smaller EEDI means smaller CO2 exhausting to the environment. With that reason, many efforts have been made to optimize ship's fuel consumption, to save the operation cost, on the one hand and to reduce the CO2 emission, or reduce EEDI on the other hand. From the EEDI equations [2], according to Bazari & Longva, 2011 and IMO MEPC 63 (2011) [2], there are 15 methods of EEDI reduction. Within these 15 methods, hull form and propulsion optimization are common approaches for many designers and researchers. To optimize the hull form and propeller, the designers need to carry many designs then select the best one based on their performance. Estimation of hull form and propeller performance usingmodel tests widely accepted as most reliable means, and could be considered as the closest method to reality. However, due to time and cost for making testing models, it is not suitable for optimization process; it is just only used to validate the result of optimization. Besides, with the rapid improvement of computational resources, Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) is getting to become a useful tool in ship design and power prediction. CFD method is able to look into local flow properties and providing a room for designers to improve the design. In this paper, the authors will investigate the capability of CFD method for propeller and propeller - hull form performance calculation, during ship optimization process. The approach of CFD here is Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANSE). During the optimization process, many designs have to be analyzed, so the level of accuracy and computational time of the calculation have to be taken into account. The paper has two major parts. For the propeller calculation in open water, the authors will perform 3 methods to model the rotation of propeller and select the best one in terms of accuracy and time consumption. Later, the self-propulsion simulation is carried out. That is a setup with full rotating propeller behind a ship. The ISIS - CFD code, integrated in the commercial software Numeca Fine Marine is used. The simulation results will be compared with model test results. Â© 2016 The Vietnam Maritime University.

JO  - Science Of The Total Environment
PY  - 2017
VL  - 607-608
IS  - NA
AB  - Rising atmospheric CO2 causes ocean acidification that represents one of the major ecological threats for marine biota. We tested the hypothesis that long-term exposure to increased CO2 level and acidification in a natural CO2 vent system alters carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) metabolism in Posidonia oceanica L. (Delile), affecting its resilience, or capability to restore the physiological homeostasis, and the nutritional quality of organic matter available for grazers. Seawater acidification decreased the C to N ratio in P. oceanica tissues and increased grazing rate, shoot density, leaf proteins and asparagine accumulation in rhizomes, while the maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II was unaffected. The 13C-dilution in both structural and non-structural C metabolites in the acidified site indicated quali-quantitative changes of C source and/or increased isotopic fractionation during C uptake and carboxylation associated with the higher CO2 level. The decreased C:N ratio in the acidified site suggests an increased N availability, leading to a greater storage of 15Nâ€“enriched compounds in rhizomes. The amount of the more dynamic C storage form, sucrose, decreased in rhizomes of the acidified site in response to the enhanced energy demand due to higher shoot recruitment and N compound synthesis, without affecting starch reserves. The ability to modulate the balance between stable and dynamic C reserves could represent a key ecophysiological mechanism for P. oceanica resilience under environmental perturbation. Finally, alteration in C and N dynamics promoted a positive contribution of this seagrass to the local food web. Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) regulates the GHG Emissions from ships through operational and technical measures. According to the survey, thousands of owners will be affected which may initially bring inflation in marine transportation economics. Many people believe that installing Energy Saving Devices could help the ships perform. On the contrary, many others are limiting the engine power, fuel consumption and emissions from highly complex network of sensors as well. The present study could benefit the ship owners who would wish to adapt a less complex methodology using Machine Learning which utilizes ship performance database of several voyages in order to do prediction of Fuel oil consumption in derated power in collaborating with the forecasted weather data. The study proposes a method to estimate the Power consumption of ships by predicting the ship operational performance at various environmental conditions, and to provide Engine Derating measures to improve the EEXI. An oil tanker is selected as the candidate vessel and a predictive model is developed with the vessel's Noon Report data. The predictive variables considered are engine brake power, engine RPM, draft, trim, speed over ground, speed through water and environmental factors. The machine learning model is trained over the analysed data and relations between parameters are established. Data is categorized into test and train datasets and a comparative analysis between combination of various multiple regression models, classification models and feature engineered datasets was conducted. The effectiveness of the models is measured based on a number of key performance indicators. The developed model can predict the power consumption of the vessel with excess of 95\% accuracy. Moreover, a preliminary version of mobile application (speed log app) is also developed to digitally enter the noon data on board the ship.

TI  - Fully coupled aero-hydrodynamic analysis of a biomimetic fractal semi-submersible floating offshore wind turbine under wind-wave excitation conditions
JO  - Renewable Energy
PY  - 2023
VL  - 203
IS  - NA
AB  - With wind energy utilization shifting to the deep sea, floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) have huge potential to improve the competitiveness of offshore wind energy generation. However, traditional FOWT systems are often in force imbalance due to the unique swaying characteristics caused by the unfixed foundation and high center of mass of the platform. Therefore, a novel bionic semi-submersible floating platform based on Victoria Amazonia (with random fractal structure) is proposed to increase the hydrodynamic stability of FOWT. A regular fractal structure with similar number of perforations and perforated area is also implemented to verify the effectiveness of the bionic FOWT. In this study, the unsteady computational fluid dynamic approach is adopted to simulate the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic response. More specifically, the dynamic fluid-body interaction module integrated in STAR-CCM+ is employed to establish a FOWT numerical model with rotating blades, tower, and mooring line system. Furthermore, the volume of fluid model in conjunction with the 6-DOF solver was used to efficiently solve the fluid-induced dynamic motion of FOWT in a multi-phase flow composed of air and water. Finally, the fully coupled calculation of the fractal structure FOWT was performed using the established reliable numerical model. The maximum average thrust and power of 736.43 kN and 5294.04 kW are obtained by random fractal FOWT in aerodynamic responses, while in hydrodynamic amplitude responses, the maximum decreases of 19.16% are obtained by both random fractal and regular fractal structures. As for amplitude responses in heave and surge, the random fractal FOWT of 12.91% and 5.05% decreases performs relatively better than the regular one (11.48% and 4.09% decreases). In addition, the visualization of unsteady flow fields and vortices in fractal structures is investigated in detail. Compared with the regular fractal structure, vortices within random fractal structure interact adequately with the pontoon walls, resulting in higher energy absorption effect and stability. Â© 2022

JO  - Iop Conference Series: Earth And Environmental Science
PY  - 2020

IS  - 1
AB  - Global shipping accounts for nearly one million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually during 2013 - 2015 period, and could grow 50%-250% by 2050 if the condition is unchanged. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) as the specialized agency responded to this issue written in MEPC.304(72) about strategy of reducing green house gas (GHG) emissions from ships. Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) is a monitoring tool based on CO2 emissions proposed by IMO written in MEPC.282(70). The purpose of this research is to evaluate factors influencing the results of EEOI. Estimation of fuel oil consumption using proposed methods by Bialystocki and Konovessis and Moreno-GutiÃ©rrez, et al. are compared with actual fuel oil consumption resulted in average error of 20.44% and 15.45%. The EEOI results is 0.000905 ton CO2/TEU-nm for MV Meratus Benoa and 0.000509 ton CO2/TEU-nm for MV Meratus Bontang. Benchmarking process using the same voyage route revealed that MV Meratus Benoa is less efficient than MV Meratus Bontang. MV Meratus Benoa carried less average cargo than MV Meratus Bontang, while having more average fuel oil consumption. Proposed improvement for better EEOI results is improving the cargo management especially for MV Meratus Benoa and evaluation in ship's operational setting for any specific sea conditions.

AB  - Although several studies have assessed soil organic carbon (SOC) of individual mangrove forests in China, no study has comprehensively investigated mangrove SOC and quantitatively estimated carbon sources ranging in latitude from tropical to subtropical latitudes. Therefore, this study explored the distribution patterns and factors controlling the deposition of SOC in four national mangroves nature reserves of southeastern China, specifically Yunxiao in Fujian Province, Gaoqiao in Guangdong Province, and Dongzhaigang and Wenchang in Hainan Province. Sediment core samples were collected and sectioned into subsamples to determine soil properties, including pH, salinity, moisture, bulk density, content and density of SOC, as well as carbon stable isotope ratios (delta C-13). SOC contents varied with sampling sites and different mangrove communities, with 1.19 +/- 0.06\%, 2.52 +/- 0.11\%, 0.81 +/- 0.101\% and 4.78 +/- 0.35\% for Yunxiao, Gaoqiao, Dongzhaigang and Wenchang sites, respectively. Soil pH, salinity, and bulk density were negatively correlated with SOC contents at all four sites. The Yunxiao site had the highest SOC delta C-13 value (-25.2 +/- 0.2\%), likely attributable to the severe invasion of Spartina alterniflora (a C-4 plant with higher delta C-13 value than typical mangrove species). Significant negative correlations were also found between SOC and the delta C-13 values in three sites except Wenchang. Our results suggest that soil texture, dominant mangrove species and biological invasion had marked effects on SOC contents and distribution patterns of tropical and subtropical mangrove forests in China.

The conference covered several topics pertaining to the technical implications of a substantial injection of gas, the ability of the reservoir to permanently contain sequestered gas, and the legal and climate change obligations of the process. Measuring the amount of CO2 that can be contained in a North Sea reservoir was also discussed during presentation. Other topics that were discussed include difficulty in monitoring the migration of CO2 within a reservoir as geophysics cannot distinguish between methane and injected CO2.

JO  - Sustainability (switzerland)
PY  - 2021

AB  - Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the global shipping sector have been increasing due to global economic growth. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set a goal of halving GHG emissions from the global shipping sector by 2050 as compared with 2008 levels, and has responded by introducing several international regulations to reduce the GHG emissions of maritime transportation. The impact of GHG emissionsâ€™ regulation and measures to curb them have been evaluated in the IMOâ€™s GHG studies. However, the long-term influence of these GHG emission measures has not yet been assessed. Additionally, the impact of various GHG reduction measures on the shipping and shipbuilding markets has not been considered; accordingly, there is room for improvement in the estimation of GHG emissions. Therefore, in this study, a model to consider GHG emission scenarios for the maritime transportation sector was developed using system dynamics and was integrated into a shipping and shipbuilding market model. The developed model was validated based on actual results and estimation results taken from a previous study. Subsequently, simulations were conducted, allowing us to evaluate the impact and effec-tiveness of GHG emission-curbing measures using the proposed model. Concretely, we conducted an evaluation of the effects of current and future measures, especially ship speed reduction, transition to liquid natural gas (LNG) fuel, promotion of energy efficiency design index (EEDI) regula-tion, and introduction of zero-emission ships, for GHG emission reduction. Additionally, we conducted an evaluation of the combination of current and future measures. The results showed that it is difficult to achieve the IMO goals for 2050 by combining only current measures and that the introduction of zero-emission ships is necessary to achieve the goals. Moreover, the limits of ship speed reduction were discussed quantitatively in relation to the maritime market aspect, and it was found that the feasible limit of ship speed reduction from a maritime market perspective was approximately 50%.

AB  - An experimental and theoretical investigation of the flow field around small-scale mesh disk rotor simulators is presented. The downstream wake flow field of the rotor simulators has been observed and measured in the 21m tilting flume at the Chilworth hydraulics laboratory, University of Southampton. The focus of this work is the proximity of flow boundaries (sea bed and surface) to the rotor disks and the constrained nature of the flow. A three-dimensional Eddy-viscosity numerical model based on an established wind turbine wake model has been modified to account for the change in fluid and the presence of a bounding free surface. This work has shown that previous axi-symmetric modeling approaches may not hold for marine current energy technology and a novel approach is required for simulation of the downstream flow field. Such modeling solutions are discussed and resultant simulation results are given. In addition, the presented work has been conducted as part of a UK Government funded project to develop validated numerical modeling tools which can predict the flow onto a marine current turbine within an array. The work feeds into the marine energy program at Southampton to assist developers with layout designs of arrays which are optimally spaced and arranged to achieve the maximum possible energy yield at a given tidal energy site.

JO  - Energy \& Fuels

AB  - Global warming along with energy demand and rising prices of natural energy resources have motivated studies to find some renewable and clean energy. The use of algae as the third-generation biofuel can avoid the competition for farmland, and algae can be considered as a potential future source of renewable energy. Algae can be used for biogas production through anaerobic digestion (AD). Fucus vesiculosus and Fucus serratus are the two dominating species of brown seaweed growing in the Baltic Sea in the southwest of Sweden. Pretreatment can significantly affect the biogas production because hydrolysis of the algae cell wall structure is a rate-limiting step in the AD process. In this study, four different pretreatments: mechanical, microwave (600 W, 2 min), ultrasonic (110 V, 15 min), and microwave combined with ultrasonic (600 W, 2 min; 110 V, 15 min) were applied to the seaweed and then codigested with a biogas plant leachate. The aim of this study was to investigate methane yields from AD after these pretreatments. The results showed that when compared with only mechanical pretreatment, the ultrasonic, ultrasonic combined with microwave, and microwave pretreatments could obtain increased cumulative methane yields of 167, 185, and 156\%, respectively. The combined pretreatment showed a maximum methane yield of 260 mL/g.of volatile solids after 20 days of digestion. The ultrasonic combined with microwave pretreatment showed a significant improvement in methane yield when compared with the mechanical pretreatment.

AB  - Over the last decades, global environmental degradation and climate changes have led to concerns about the continued use of fossil fuels. Maritime transport is not only an important element of the global energy supply chain but by itself is a global consumer of energy, contributing to climate impact. To reduce the impact of shipping on the global environment, the International Maritime Organization has established new regulations on emissions from ships. A large number of potential solutions are announced and developed as a means to minimize emissions onboard ships, such as LNG, LPG, methanol, hydrogen, ammonia or to use electric batteries, etc. The article encloses the main factors of international maritime transport activity contributing to global warming, offers a look at the fuel usage for shipping as a sequential element of energy chain following his particular life cycle.

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Objectives/Scope: Downhole Annular Barrier (DAB) systems employed in intervention can correct integrity and conformance control issues during well lifecycle, extending the productive term in a safe and costeffective manner. These emergent wireline technologies come with unique challenges for logistics, quality control, and engineering, but can also provide solutions to difficult problems, with high value to spend ratio, in the non-rig intervention sector. The paper will review one such successful intervention, completed offshore Trinidad W.I., in a gas well presenting long term Sustained Casing Pressure (SCP). The desired end state of the well was A-Annulus at 0 psi SCP, which would return the well to a safe state and permit a planned infrastructure project to move ahead. Methods, Procedures, Process: Operational objective was isolation of the casing annulus pressure from the source by injecting epoxy into the annular space at depth, forming a 360-degree pressure barrier. The project can be broken down into three main sections. The paper and presentation will address each section with its specific challenges, learnings, and outcomes: Onshore Epoxy and Tool Preparation Each Downhole Annular Barrier job employs a custom recipe epoxy suited to the planned logistics timing and expected bottomhole conditions. Quality control of the epoxy recipe and mixing process as well as temperature control of the batch after mixing is key to the sealing properties of the final epoxy plug. â€¢ An Epoxy Lab and Mixing Station was dismantled, air freighted, and reconstituted in Trinidad near to the field operations port. Special insulated offshore CCU were built to transport and contain filled epoxy canisters while maintaining low temperature requirements (near to 0 deg C for up to 30 days). â€¢ Build and System Integration Testing (SIT) of the downhole system (anchoring, stroking, hydraulic testing, perforation, and injection) with the electric line system (conveyance, telemetry, power). Offshore Job Execution The DAB system employed is designed to complete multiple operations in a single trip into the well, including perforating and high-pressure epoxy injection, with precise position control and monitoring. This is made possible with the multifunction modular tool. The operation was dynamic by design and contingencies were implemented based on the well response. Multiple epoxy annular plugs were placed into the A Annulus at depth, with high pressure injection. Results, Observations, Conclusions: Well Response and Assessment Utilizing advanced annular surface monitoring technology and PvT analysis, precise assessment of the annulus pressure build was recorded throughout the operation. Once the project criteria were met, the operation was successfully concluded. Copyright 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

AB  - The main source of emissions from sea-going vessels is the exhaust gas from burning fuel in the ship's combustion engines. The first regulation of exhaust gas emissions from ships, which came into effect twenty years ago, was not strict. However, the global 2020 cap on maximum 0.5 % sulphur in the exhaust gas from the ships combustion engines, in combination with the required reduction of nitrogen and carbon emissions for new-built vessels, is an economical and technical challenge for the shipping industry. Alternative fuels such as LNG, LPG, Methanol or Hydrogen is one tempting option for meeting these new requirements. Alternatively, traditional fuels can be used in combination with measures such as exhaust gas cleaning, engine and combustion process modifications. The data and literature of the options and their pros and cons tends to be fragmented and not easily available for shipping- lines, designers and builders. For these reasons, the motivation for this study has been to give an overview of options and compare based upon key performance indicators. The comparison includes; Emissions from Combustion; Well to wake emissions; Space and weight requirements; and Cost. Â© SNAME, SOME 2018.All rights reserved.

AB  - To be efficient means more than optimizing a ship to bum less fuel when loaded and at its design service speed. It must bum less fuel and cleaner fuel across a wide range of loading conditions and a wide range of speeds. To be efficient means more than saving fuel; it means burning the right fuel in the right place, making a pathway for the use of gas, nuclear, and fuel cell solutions. BV has prepared new guidance on compliance with future IMO-mandated energy efficiency standards, by way of information notes covering certification of the Energy Efficiency Design Index and Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan, respectively. For owners who wish to go beyond IMO efficiency edicts, the society has developed a new, additional class notation, Energy Efficiency Monitoring. This will encompass the energy performance of the ships main equipment, e.g., propulsion machinery, generating sets, boilers, propeller, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning installations, lighting, deck gear, and cargo pumps. The notation will cover measurement of operational and ambient data, calculation of the equipment's actual energy performance, corrections of performance in accordance with standard reference data for sea state, ambient conditions, and comparisons between original and corrected performance. By such means, the owner may identify and focus on equipment which is not running as it should, with the aim of maximizing overall ship efficiency. BV is participating in the French collaborative research project EONAV, aimed at developing an onboard decision support tool to help reduce vessel energy consumption and emissions.

AB  - Numerical modelling is likely the only available tool to evaluate and predict the fate of CO2 injected in deep geological reservoirs, and particularly in depleted hydrocarbon fields. Here we present a methodology which aims at evaluating the geological leaking risk of an underground storage using a depleted oil field as the host reservoir. The methodology combines basin and reservoir scale simulations to determine the efficiency of the storage. The approach was designed for the study of the reservoir after the injection of CO2 and then does not take into account any CO2 injection period. The approach was applied to the Forties field (North Sea) for which CO2 behaviour was simulated for a 1000 y time period. Our findings suggest that local geological conditions are quite favourable for CO2 sequestration. Possible residence time of CO2 will be in the order of thousands of years and, thus such geological depleted hydrocarbon fields storage is probably a good alternative for a long term CO2 sequestration. Additionally, results of this work can help to establish criteria to identify other mature hydrocarbon fields aimed for CO2 sequestration. Copyright Â© 2005, Institut franÃ§ais du pÃ©trole.

AB  - We investigated the effect of artificial marine cloud brightening on extreme temperatures over East Asia. We used simulation data from five global climate models which have conducted the GeoMIP G4cdnc experiment. G4cdnc was designed to simulate an increase in the cloud droplet number concentration of the global marine lower clouds by 50\% under the greenhouse gas forcing of the RCP4.5 scenario. G4cdnc decreased the net radiative forcing in the top of the atmosphere more over the ocean, alleviating the rise in mean temperature under RCP4.5 forcing. For extreme temperatures, G4cdnc reduced both the monthly minimum of daily minimum temperature (TNn) and monthly maximum of daily maximum temperature (TXx). The response of TNn was higher than that of TXx, especially in the winter, over the Sea of Okhotsk and the interior of the continent. This spatial heterogeneity and seasonality of the response were associated with sea ice-albedo and snow-albedo feedbacks. We also calculated the efficacy of warming mitigation as a measure of the relative effect of geoengineering. The efficacy for TXx was higher than that for TNn, opposite to the absolute effect. After the termination of geoengineering, both TNn and TXx tended to rapidly revert to their trend under the RCP4.5 forcing.

AB  - There is a significant increase in the attention given to green maritime ship technologies due to the growing importance of sustainable operations. mainly due to the implementation of several new legislative actions taken by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). There is considerable potential for reducing emissions in the shipping sector. Various solutions are already existing and a plethora of technologies available for retrofitting on existing vessels. The article presents an example of practical application of energy saving by fitting the central cooling system with keel cooler on the Car Ferry 'ASD' trading in west Africa. The use of that solution is limited to small ships, with new development, central cooling system with keel coolers has a chance to spread out on bigger ships in the future. It will mainly depend on efficiency and reliability of keel coolers secure systems. Â© 2018 IEEE.

AB  - The study presents an investigation of Waves4Powerâ€™s WaveEL 3.0 wave energy converter (WEC). It was used as a reference for full-scale measurements of the mooring forces and buoy motions in a measurement campaign 2017 at an installation location off the coast of Runde in Norway. A numerical simulation model of the installation was developed in the DNV GL software SESAM. Unfortunately, the sea state conditions were not measured during the measurement campaign. Hence, a methodology was developed that used the recorded motion data to compute the sea state conditions at the test site. The simulated WEC motions based on the computed sea states agreed very well with the measured WEC motions. The measured and simulated mooring forces were compared under various environmental conditions. 3-hour sea state realizations are typically preferred in numerical simulations. However, influences from the tide at the test site showed that sea states were normally stationary for only 1â€“2 h. The measured and simulated average mooring forces agreed very well during 1-hour periods, whereas the simulations overestimated the mooring forces in 3-hour periods because of the tide.

AB  - We have investigated a hybrid power train for ship crane operations, using a lithium-ion battery in conjunction with diesel gensets for auxiliary power generation, as an alternative to a conventional power train using only gensets. We have simulated crane operations in port using both solutions, in order to quantify the potential economic gains of using hybrid power generation. This study is based on a real open-hatch dry bulk vessel of 50,000 dwt, which is compared with a corresponding newbuilding ship with hybrid auxiliary power generation. We have modelled the complete auxiliary power system, including diesel generators, lithium-ion batteries, cranes and ship hotel consumers. We have developed a novel hybrid control strategy that has the potential to reduce the minimal size and thereby cost of batteries for hybrid ships. Our results indicate that the hybrid solution will lead to about 30\% reduced fuel consumption and CO2 emissions while operating cranes, which amounts to annual savings of \$110,000, with \$450,000 savings over three years of operation, as well as reduced capital costs compared to the conventional power generation system.

AB  - OMEGA (Offshore Membrane Enclosures for Growing Algae) is a system for growing microalgae in closed, floating photo-bioreactors constructed of flexible, inexpensive, and durable plastic with small sections of semi-permeable membranes for gas exchange and forward osmosis (FO). OMEGA modules are filled with municipal wastewater and further fertilized by pumping CO2-rich exhaust into OMEGA from wastewater facilities, coastal power plants, or other local sources. OMEGA modules float just below the surface; the surrounding saltwater provides structural support and temperature control, while surface waves mix the algae inside. FO membranes dewater the culture over the 10-day growth cycle to facilitate harvesting. If the system leaks, it releases wastewater that meets current regulation, and freshwater algae that cannot survive in the surrounding saline environment. OMEGA's operation provides a triple payback: production of biofuels, fertilizer, and other valued products, wastewater processing, and carbon sequestration.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to examine plant biomass accumulation and carbon (C) storage in four different aged Sonneratia apetala plantations in the Leizhou Bay in South China. The allometric equations using diameter at breast height (DBH) and height (H) were developed to quantify plant biomass. The total forest biomass (TFB) of S. apetala plantation at 4, 5, 8, and 10 years old was 47.9, 71.7, 95.9, and 108.1 Mg ha(-1), respectively. The forest biomass C storage in aboveground (AGB) and roots at 4, 5, 8, and 10-year plantation was 19.9, 32.6, 42.0, 49.0 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Soil organic C (SOC) on the top 20 cm of sediments increased by 0.3, 6.8, 27.4, and 35.0 Mg ha(-1)after 4, 5, 8, and 10 years of reforestation, respectively. The average annual rate of total carbon storage (TCS) accumulation at 4, 5, 8, and 10-year S. apetala plantation was 5.0, 7.9, 8.7, and 8.4 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The TCS values in this study were underestimated because we only estimated SOC storage on the top 20-cm sediments in these plantations. This study suggests these young S. apetala plantations have the characteristics of fast growth, high biomass accumulation, and high C storage capacity, especially in sediments. They sequestrated C at a high but varying rate over time. The large-scale reforestation of S. apetala plantations in the open coastal mudflats in southern China has great potential to sequestrate more C as well as restore the degraded coastal land. The potential ecological issues associated with the increasing monoculture plantations were discussed. More long-term monitoring and research are needed to further evaluate biomass and C accumulation of S. apetala plantations over time as well as how the increasing distribution of this monoculture plantation will influence the few native mangrove remnants.

JO  - Chemosphere
PY  - 2022
VL  - 286
IS  - 3
AB  - Mangrove wetlands are subjected to pollution due to anthropogenic activities. Mangrove fitness is mainly determined by root exudates and microorganisms activities belowground, but the mechanisms are not yet well known. Rhizospheric interactions among mangrove sediments, microorganisms and root exudates were simulated. In particular, low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOA), were examined to explore the metal(loid)s rhizospheric dynamics via batch experiments. Using a combination of comparative sterilised and unsterilised sediments, LMWOA extracts and sediments constituents were examined. Factors such as the solution pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), arsenic and iron species and metal(loid)s in the aqueous phase were evaluated. The results show that on an average, the As decreased by 68.3 \% and 42.1 \% under citric and malic acid treatments, respectively, after sterilisation. In contrast, the As content increased by 29.6 \% under oxalic acid treatment. Microorganisms probably facilitate sediment As release in the presence of citric and malic acids but suppress As mobilisation in the presence of oxalic acid. Fe, Mn and Al were significantly (p < 0.05) positively correlated with the trace metal(loid)s (Zn, Pb, Ni, Cu, Cr, Co, Ba, Cd and As). The solution pH was negatively correlated with the solution As. Both DOC and pH reach the peaks at the end of all treatments. The As absorption-desorption dynamics are closely linked to proton consumption, Fe-Mn-Al sedimentation of ageing performance and organic ligand complexation. The study provides an insight into the rhizospheric processes of microbial involvement and gives an enlightening understanding of the metal(loid)s redeployment for plant adaptation in mangrove wetlands.

JO  - Ieee Transactions On Energy Conversion
PY  - 2017
VL  - 32
IS  - 2
AB  - All-electric ships (AES) are considered as an effective solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions as they provide a better platform to use alternative clean energy sources such as fuel cells (FC) in place of fossil fuel. Even though FCs are promising alternative, their response is not fast enough to meet load transients that can occur in ships at sea. Therefore, high-density rechargeable battery storage systems are required to achieve stable operation under such transients. Generally, in such hybrid systems, dc/dc converters are used to interface the FC and battery into the dc link. This paper presents an intelligent FC power management strategy to improve FC performance at various operating points without employing dc/dc interfacing converters. A hybrid AES driveline model using genetic programming is utilized using Simulink and GeneXProTools4 to formulate operating FC voltage based on the load current, FC air, and fuel flow rates. Genetic algorithm is used to adjust air and fuel flow rates to keep the FC within the safe operating range at different power demands. The proposed method maintains FC performance as well as reduces fuel consumption, and, thereby, ensures the optimal power sharing between the FC and the lithium-ion battery in AES application.

TI  - Enhancing CO2 bio-mitigation by genetic engineering of cyanobacteria
JO  - Energy \& Environmental Science
PY  - 2012
VL  - 5
IS  - 8
AB  - The increasing of atmospheric CO2, which is considered as a major greenhouse gas, plays a crucial role in global warming and climate change. In addition to reducing CO2 emissions from anthropogenic activities, it is more urgent to actively remove CO2 from the air. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a feasible but high-cost technology to remove CO2 from the flue gases of coal-fired power plants. On the other hand, CO2 sequestration by biological approaches shows potential and has the benefit that the biomass generated from the fixed CO2 can then be utilized for other purposes. However, CO2 bio-mitigation technology is still under development because the efficiency of CO2 capture and fixation is too low to be applicable in industry. In this study, we enhanced a photobioreactor-based microalgal CO2 mitigation system by combining the chemical capture/transformation of CO2 by carbonic anhydrase (CA) with the biological fixation of captured CO2 by cyanobacteria. We genetically engineered the cyanobacteria to produce and secrete CAs in the medium. The secreted CAs efficiently transformed dissolved CO2 to HCO3-. And HCO3- was taken up by the cyanobacteria and further fixed into biomass through photosynthesis. To our knowledge, we have demonstrated for the first time that CO2 can be sequestrated in a sustainable way through combining the chemical transformation of CO2 with the biological CO2 fixation in a microalgal photobioreactor system.

AB  - Protection of the environment, especially within the most recent years, has become a constant problem considered by the states and the governments of the world, which are more and more concerned about the serious problems caused by the continuous deterioration of the environment. The long term effects of pollution on the environment generated by the lack of penalty regulations, have directed the attention of statesmen upon the necessity of the elaboration of normative acts meant to be effective in the continuous fight with it. Maritime transportation generates approximately 4\% of the total of the CO2 emissions produced by human activities. This paper is intended to present two methods of estimation of the gases emissions on-board a vessel, methods that are very useful for the crews which are exploiting them. For the determination and the validation of these methods we are going to use the determinations from the tank ship. This ship has as a main propulsion engine Wartsila DU Sulzer RT Flex 50 - 6 cylinders that develops a maximal power of 9720 kW and has a permanent monitoring system of the pollutant emissions. The methods we develop here are using the values of the polluting elements from the exhaust gases that are determined at the exit of the vessel from the ship yard, in the framework of the acceptance tests. These values have been introduced within the framework of a matrix in the MATHCAD program. This matrix represents the starting point of the two mentioned methods: the analytical method and the graphical method. During the study we are going to evaluate the development and validation of an analytical tool to be used to determine the standard of emissions aimed at thermal machines on ships. One of the main objectives of this article represents an objective assessment of the expediency of using non-fuels for internal combustion engines in vessels.

The United States (US) and other donors are providing financial and technical support for climate change country studies to help meet their needs under the UNFCCC The US Country Studies Program (US CSP) was originally announced by President Bush at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Brazil in 1992. The Program is currently assisting 56 country studies to address climate change. There are strong components of ocean and coastal assessment, adaptation and management in 41 of the 56 studies in the US CSP. All studies in the Program are implemented under respective bilateral cooperative agreements. Technical assistance for conducting GHG inventory, climate change impact vulnerability studies, and adaptation and mitigation assessments includes training of analysts, sharing of contemporary tools and assessment techniques, implementation of information-sharing workshops, and an exchange program for analysts. Emphases have been put on strengthening of human and institutional capacity to cope with global climate change issues, hence providing developing and transition countries with a sustained basis for meeting the goals of the UNFCCC.

AB  - It is difficult to identify the operational modal parameters of an offshore wind turbine structure accurately because the structural modal information in its responses is buried by the strong recurring harmonic excitation induced from the wind turbine's impeller with high rotating speed. In order to solve the problem of structural operational modal identification, a method combining the modified eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) with the probability density function (PDF) was proposed here. Subsequently, the interference coming from the rotating frequencies and frequency multiplication was eliminated and the effective identification for the multi-operational modal parameters of a certain offshore wind turbine test prototype was achieved based on the measured signals under different operational conditions. It was shown that this approach can not only avoid the strong harmonic interference so as to obtain the real structural operational modes effectively, but also has a better engineering applicability in online real-time monitoring and evaluation of the structural operational security for offshore wind turbine structures.

PY  - 2015

AB  - This study assesses the economic and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions impacts of a proposed 400-MW wind farm (Big Wind) in Hawaii. Due to its island setting, this project is a hybrid between onshore and offshore wind development. An undersea cable would carry the power from Maui County, which has high-quality wind areas, to the population center of Oahu, which has fewer sites for wind power. The project is additionally motivated by Hawaiiâ€™s high electricity rates, which are nearly three times the national average, and a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) mandating that 40Â % of the Stateâ€™s electricity sales be met through renewable sources by the year 2030. Using an economy-wide computable general equilibrium model coupled with a fully dynamic optimization model for the electric sector, we find that the 400-Â MW wind project increases gross state product by $2.2 billion (in net present value) and average annual per capita income by $60 per year. Although there are potentially near-term welfare losses if there are capital cost overruns, fuel costs are a dominant factor in determining the cost-effectiveness of the project. However, without upgrades to Hawaiiâ€™s grid and/or its operations, there is a trade-off between investment in wind energy projects and solar PV. If higher levels of intermittent resources cannot be integrated into the system, higher-cost biofuels serve a more prominent role in meeting the RPS. Without upgrades, wind and solar PV generation are restricted, and hence, reduction in GHG emissions in excess of those present without the Big Wind project is negligible. With upgrades, the project is estimated to reduce GHG emissions by an additional (Formula presented.) from 2020 to 2040. Â© 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

JO  - Nature Climate Change

VL  - 6

AB  - Human-induced ocean acidification impacts marine life. Marine bacteria are major drivers of biogeochemical nutrient cycles and energy fluxes(1); hence, understanding their performance under projected climate change scenarios is crucial for assessing ecosystem functioning. Whereas genetic and physiological responses of phytoplankton to ocean acidification are being disentangled(2-4), corresponding functional responses of bacterioplankton to pH reduction from elevated CO2 are essentially unknown. Here we show, from metatranscriptome analyses of a phytoplankton bloom mesocosm experiment, that marine bacteria responded to lowered pH by enhancing the expression of genes encoding proton pumps, such as respiration complexes, proteorhodopsin and membrane transporters. Moreover, taxonomic transcript analysis showed that distinct bacterial groups expressed different pH homeostasis genes in response to elevated CO2. These responses were substantial for numerous pH homeostasis genes under low-chlorophyll conditions (chlorophyll a <2.5 mu g l(-1)); however, the changes in gene expression under high-chlorophyll conditions (chlorophyll a >20 mu g l(-1))were low. Given that proton expulsion through pH homeostasis mechanisms is energetically costly, these findings suggest that bacterioplankton adaptation to ocean acidification could have long-term effects on the economy of ocean ecosystems.

AB  - The shipping sector is becoming increasingly aware of global environmental impact of ships and is forced, by international legislation, to gradually reduce its emissions. International conventions (IMO) and energy efficiency standards set challenges to shipping sector, to ship owners and ship designers, to offer propulsion concepts which will effectively reduce or completely eliminate emission rates and increase energy efficiency with acceptable technological costs and adjustment time. New concepts include environmental friendly fuels in existing propulsion architecture, hybrid propulsion and all-electric propulsion architecture with the possible application of renewable energy sources, which are reviewed in this paper. Each concept has advantages and disadvantages regarding adjustment time, implementation cost and energy storage system capacity. The conclusion of this paper is that the Internal Combustion (IC) engines won't be completely replaced in the shipping sector in middle term, but will be able to use environmental friendly fuels or fuels without global carbon footprint, such as e-ammonia, blue-ammonia and bio-methanol as the most promising carbon-neutral fuels in the decarbonization path.

VL  - 245

AB  - The shipping industry is facing increasing demands to reduce its environmental footprints. This has resulted in adoption of new and more environmental friendly power sources and fuels for on-board power generation. One of these novel power sources is the Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) which has a great potential to act as a power source, thanks to its high efficiency and capability to handle a wide variety of fuel types. However, SOFCs suffer from low transient capabilities and therefore have never been considered to be used as the main power source for maritime applications. In this paper, novel component sizing, energy and power management approaches are proposed to enable the use of SOFCs as the main on-board power source for the first time in the literature and integrate them into the liquefied natural gas fueled Power and Propulsion System (PPS) of vessels. The proposed component sizing approach determines the power ratings of the on-board sources (SOFC, gas engine and battery) considering size and weight limits, while the energy and power management approaches guarantee an optimal power split between different power sources and PPS stability while looking after battery aging. The results indicate that the combined proposed optimization-based approaches can yield up to 53\% CO2 reduction and 21\% higher fuel utilization efficiency compared to conventional diesel-electric vessels.

AB  - The Paris Basin seems a suitable location for CO2 capture and storage given both the amount of CO2 produced and the availability of depleted fields and deep saline aquifers. This study investigates the petrophysical properties in relation to the sedimentary and diagenetic environment of the Oolithe Blanche Formation (Middle Jurassic), a deep saline aquifer considered a potential candidate for CO2 storage. Because of the scarcity of core data in the Paris Basin, our investigation was based on the study of field analogues in the south-east part of the Paris Basin. The Oolithe Blanche Formation (Bathonian) is 70-80m thick. Eighteen oriented blocks were collected from three outcrops selected for the different sedimentological facies identified in the formation. Their petrophysical properties were measured: porosity, pore size distribution derived from mercury injection tests, permeability and capillary imbibition parameters. The sedimentary and diagenetic facies were defined by using optical microscopy coupled with image analysis on thin sections and SEM. The Oolithe Blanche Formation is composed of oolitic and bioclastic limestones, deposited in a shallow marine setting. Three main sedimentological facies were defined: the oolitic shoal facies, the tide dominated facies and the prograding oolitic facies. They exhibit subtle variations in composition and in the distribution of carbonate textures. Porosity, measured using the water saturation triple weight method, ranges from 6% to 34%. Permeability values are low, between 0.1mD and 9mD. The data from mercury intrusion porosimetry show that the distribution of the pore throat diameter is either unimodal (microporosity only) or bimodal (macro- and microporosity). Microporosity is intraparticle (intraooid) and macroporosity is interparticle and is related to dolo-dedolomitization. Variations of petrophysical parameters can be explained by the microstructure. Now, these latter results calibrated by studying field analogues must be extended to borehole data and core data to optimize our knowledge of the deep saline aquifer of the Oolithe Blanche Formation. Without such investigations, it will be impossible to estimate the suitability of this deep saline aquifer for CO2 storage. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Impact of waste heat recovery systems on energy efficiency improvement of a heavy-duty diesel engine
JO  - Archives Of Thermodynamics
PY  - 2017
VL  - 38
IS  - 3
AB  - The increase of ship's energy utilization efficiency and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions have been high lightened in recent years and have become an increasingly important subject for ship designers and owners. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is seeking measures to reduce the CO2 emissions from ships, and their proposed energy efficiency design index (EEDI) and energy efficiency operational indicator (EEOI) aim at ensuring that future vessels will be more efficient. Waste heat recovery can be employed not only to improve energy utilization efficiency but also to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, a typical conceptual large container ship employing a low speed marine diesel engine as the main propulsion machinery is introduced and three possible types of waste heat recovery systems are designed. To calculate the EEDI and EEOI of the given large container ship, two software packages are developed. From the viewpoint of operation and maintenance, lowering the ship speed and improving container load rate can greatly reduce EEOI and further reduce total fuel consumption. Although the large container ship itself can reach the IMO requirements of EEDI at the first stage with a reduction factor 10% under the reference line value, the proposed waste heat recovery systems can improve the ship EEDI reduction factor to 20% under the reference line value.

AB  - The revised MARPOL Convention addresses emissions from ships under Annex VI, chapter 4, entered into force since 1st January 2013. It set mandatory measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from international shipping, with the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) made mandatory for new ships, and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) made a requirement for all ships. The major consumption of energy and burning of fuel onboard is generally required for Ballast water management, Sea water cooling, Cargo operation and Propulsion. Energy efficiency plays the most important role in reduction of energy consumption, fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, accounting for up to 53% of total CO2 emission reductions onboard ship. In pumping applications onboard vessels for sea water cooling systems, the use of proposed Variable Frequency Drives (VFD) control can cut the energy consumption by as much as 60%. Here we have developed a model of adjustable speed drives for controlling high power centrifugal pumps onboard ship for energy conservation and eco-friendly sailing. The results of simulation shows that the proposed method of flow control using VFD not only saves energy but also reduces burning of fuel and also results in a reduction of greenhouse gas emission. Therefore by the use of proposed Green, Smart and Intelligent technology, we can save significant energy and reduce emission of GHG, so as to meet stringent norms as per MARPOL ANNEX-VI, Chapter-4.

AB  - Algae are organisms that grow in marine environments and use carbon dioxide and light to create bio-mass. There are two groupings of algae: microalgae and macroalgae. Macroalgae are the large, multi-cellular algae often seen growing in ponds. Microalgae, on the other hand, are tiny, unicellular algae that normally grow in suspension within a body of water. Algae oil from microalgae has the possible to become a sustainable fuel source as biodiesel. Microalgae are produced through photosynthesis by utilizing sunlight, water, carbon dioxide and other nutrients. The Botryococcus braunii algal oil was extracted by mechanical extraction method. The transesterification reaction of Botryococcus braunii algal oil with methanol and base catalyst was used for the production of biodiesel. The samples B20 were prepared for each methyl ester obtained from Botryococcus braunii algal oil separately and then the doping of TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles were added to the each B20 blend samples at a dosage of 50 ppm and 100 ppm with an aid of ultrasonicator. Moreover, in the absence of any engine modifications, the performance and emission characteristics of those blend samples have been investigated from the experimentally measured values such as density, viscosity, calorific value, etc. while the engine performance was also analyzed through the parameters like BSFC, BTH, exhaust emission of CO, HC, NOx and CO2. The experimental results reveal that the use of biodiesel blend with nano additives in diesel engine has exhibited good improvement in performance characteristic and reduction in exhaust emissions.

AB  - Global average temperature has increased in the last one hundred years. This increase in temperature is labeled as global warming, which is due to different greenhouse gases that pollute the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is the largest contributor, its main source being from the electricity production sector. There has been discussion by experts and organizations as to whether zero carbon dioxide emissions in this sector is possible by 2050. This paper studies and analyzes wind, nuclear, and hydroelectric power production to accomplish this goal. It also examines and selects the ideal turbine (onshore and offshore) for each year from 2018 to 2050 using estimated research and development. The scope focuses on night time base load to exclude solar energy from this study. The strategy represents the entire United States by focusing on 20 metropolitan areas (Case Shiller Metropolitan Areas). Due to time constraints, only a select 5 of the 20 Case Shiller metropolitan areas will be modeled. Using Mathematical Programming Language for linear programming, we optimized the number of each alternative in each region modeled. An economic model was used from National Renewable Energy Laboratory to estimate the job growth for the system in the areas. The analysis provides the cost and economic impact that the system will have on the regions. It is recommended that a method to levitate the price of the system is needed which can be in the form of carbon tax or governmental subsidies. Â© 2017 IEEE.

JO  - Journal Of Marine Science And Engineering
PY  - 2021
VL  - 9
IS  - 4
AB  - Accurate, reliable, and real-time prediction of ship fuel consumption is the basis and premise of the development of fuel optimization; however, ship fuel consumption data mainly come from noon reports, and many current modeling methods have been based on a single model; therefore they have low accuracy and robustness. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid fuel consumption prediction model based on sensor data collected from an ocean-going container ship. First, a data processing method is proposed to clean the collected data. Secondly, the Bayesian optimization method of hyperparameters is used to reasonably set the hyperparameter values of the model. Finally, a hybrid fuel consumption prediction model is established by integrating extremely randomized tree (ET), random forest (RF), Xgboost (XGB) and multiple linear regression (MLR) methods. The experimental results show that data cleaning, the size of the dataset, marine environmental factors, and hyperparameter optimization can all affect the accuracy of the model, and the proposed hybrid model provides better predictive performance (higher accuracy) and greater robustness (smaller standard deviation) as compared with a single model. The proposed hybrid model should play a significant role in ship fuel consumption real-time monitoring, fault diagnosis, energy saving and emission reduction, etc.

AB  - Marine pollution is one of the main concerns of our society. In order to reduce air pollution produced by ships, the International Maritime Organization has developed technical, operational and management measures. Part of the operational measures refers to CO2 emissions that contribute to the energy efficiency of the vessel. The difficulty in assessing the energy efficiency of the vessel rests with the diversity of voyage parameters, including quantity of cargo, distance and type of fuel in use. Assessing the energy efficiency of the vessel is thus not a matter of determining the absolute value of the CO2, but of providing a meaningful construct to enable tracking performance trends over time, for the same ship, a fleet of ships or across the industry. This concept is the Energy Efficiency Operational Index, EEOI. The purpose of this study is to analyse the influence of a well predicted voyage on the EEOI value. The method used consists in a comparative analysis of two situations regarding berthing prospects: the real passage plan and an early prediction that supposes the vessel to arrive on time as required. The results of the study represent a monitoring tool for the ship owners to assess the EEOI from the early stage of designing the berthing prospects.

JO  - Biogeosciences
PY  - 2013
VL  - 10
IS  - 11
AB  - A mesocosm experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of photosynthetic performance on the energetic balance of coastal phytoplankton, in relation to community production and autotrophic phytoplankton biomass in future coastal oceans. Natural phytoplankton assemblages were incubated in field mesocosms under ambient condition (control: ca. 400 mu atm CO2 and ambient temperature), and two sets of potential future ocean conditions (acidification: ca. 900 mu atm CO2 and ambient temperature; greenhouse: ca. 900 mu atm CO2 and 3 degrees C warmer). The photosynthetic performances were estimated by in vivo fluorometry (effective quantum yield (Phi(PSII)), steady-state light response curves (LCs)) and in situ incorporation of C-14 (photosynthesisirradiance curves). The Phi(PSII) and rETR(m,LC) (relative maximum electron transport rate) clearly reduced under acidification, in particular, when phytoplankton were exposed to high light levels. However, P-max(B) (maximum photosynthetic rate) was the same in the ambient and acidification conditions. Thus, phytoplankton utilized less light under acidification condition, but could still assimilate a similar amount of carbon compared to the ambient condition. The P-max(B) and alpha (photosynthetic efficiency) under greenhouse condition were significantly higher than those under ambient condition without any difference in Phi(PSII), rETR(m,LC) and alpha(,LC) (electron transport efficiency) between the treatments. Therefore, phytoplankton utilized the same amount of light under greenhouse condition, but could assimilate more carbon than under ambient condition. As a result, Chl a normalized primary production was higher in greenhouse than in other conditions. Nevertheless, the community production did not change between the experimental treatments. The main reason for the lack of a change in primary production under future climate conditions is the control of autotrophic phytoplankton biomass by grazing. Consequently, acidification and greenhouse environments have a potential to increase growth and primary production of phytoplankton by enhancing inorganic carbon assimilation efficiency when top-down regulation is negligible.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 161
IS  - NA
AB  - Recently, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and government sectors have enacted several stringent regulations to curb the emissions of ships. Green fuel and scrubber installation are two prevailing adaptation strategies used by ships to reduce emissions. Green fuel leads to a high shipping cost with the consumption of low-sulphur but highly-priced oil, while scrubber installation is a long-term decision, which incurs a high capital cost from the setting up of desulphurization facilities but ensures ships can continue consuming low-priced oil. This paper makes a theoretical and holistic investigation of the strategy choice of a container ship in an inland river by taking into account the impact of streamflow velocity. For the inland shipping service, the sailing speed of a ship is the sum of its engine speed and streamflow velocity. The engine speed determines the fuel consumption, and the sailing speed determines the round-trip time of a ship. We found that the engine speed of a ship increases with respect to the streamflow velocity under both strategies in the sense of cost minimization. Also, the streamflow velocity increases the incentive of a ship to install a scrubber. Finally, numerical experiments based on the Yangtze River are conducted to demonstrate our proposed models.

JO  - Environmental Research Letters
PY  - 2021
VL  - 16
IS  - 6
AB  - To reduce local air pollution, many ports in developed countries require berthed ships to use shore-based electricity instead of burning diesel to meet their electricity requirement for loads such as lights, cargo-handling equipment, and air conditioning. The benefits of this strategy in developing countries remain understudied. Based on government data for all major ports in India, we find that switching from high-sulfur fuel to shore power reduces hoteling emissions of particulate matter (PM2.5) by 88%; SO2 by 39%; NO x by 85%; but increases CO2 emissions by 12%. Switching from low-sulfur fuel reduces hoteling emissions of PM2.5 by 46% and NO x by 84% but increases SO2 emissions by 240% and CO2 emissions by 17%. The lifetime cost savings from the switch to electricity are $73 M for high-sulfur fuel and $370 M for low-sulfur fuel. We estimate that switching from high-sulfur fuel to shore power might avoid at most a couple of dozen premature deaths each year, whereas switching from low-sulfur fuel could lead to a slight increase in premature mortality. Therefore, policymakers must first clean up power generation for shore power to be a viable strategy to improve air quality in Indian port cities. Â© 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Blue biotechnology can greatly help solve some of the most serious social problems due to its wide biodiversity, which includes marine environments. Microalgae are important resources for human needs as an alternative to terrestrial plants because of their rich biodiversity, rapid growth, and product contributions in many fields. The production scheme for microalgae biomass mainly consists of two processes: (I) the Build-Up process and (II) the Pull-Down process. The Build-Up process consists of (1) the super strain concept and (2) cultivation aspects. The Pull-Down process includes (1) harvesting and (2) drying algal biomass. In some cases, such as the manufacture of algal products, the (3) extraction of bioactive compounds is included. Microalgae have a wide range of commercial applications, such as in aquaculture, biofertilizer, bioenergy, pharmaceuticals, and functional foods, which have several industrial and academic applications around the world. The efficiency and success of biomedical products derived from microalgal biomass or its metabolites mainly depend on the technologies used in the cultivation, harvesting, drying, and extraction of microalgae bioactive molecules. The current review focuses on recent advanced technologies that enhance microalgae biomass within microalgae production schemes. Moreover, the current work highlights marine drugs and human health products derived from microalgae that can improve human immunity and reduce viral activities, especially COVID-19.

AB  - Recent regulatory developments in the maritime industry will hasten the shift in usage of conventional marine fuels like HFO and MDO to a cleaner fuel like Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) to meet its ambitious target of lowering carbon dioxide and other noxious gases emissions. Efficient use of energy and waste heat recovery and onboard a ship will help the industry meet this target in the meantime. This paper presents the findings from the modelling of a dual fuel marine diesel engine and ORC system cooled by vaporising LNG and simulation using a system engineering software, Siemens Simcenter Amesim 16. Engine manufacturer's design data is used as inputs to run the ORC systems running on two working fluids, n-heptane and n-octane to derive the net work and thermal efficiency when installed on a LNG-fuelled Platform Supply Vessel. The ORC system running on n-heptane is found to provide an annual fuel savings of 7\% with an estimated payback period of 2.7 years, making it an attractive option for shipowners.

AB  - The emerging concept of integrated demand response (IDR) is a promising platform for promoting the utilization of renewable energy sources (RES) and improving energy efficiency in multi-energy systems. In this paper, a robust scheduling model for a power, cool, and hydrogen-based islanded microgrid (MG) in the presence of hydrogen fueling stations (HFSs) and EV parking lots (EVPLs) is proposed. Additionally, the impact of power and cooling-based IDR is investigated in reducing the operating cost of the proposed system. The proposed multi-energy MG is equipped with power generation, wind turbine, electrical, cooling and hydrogen storage systems, power to hydrogen (P2H) facility and an electrical chiller to meet power, cooling, and hydrogen demands simultaneously. In order to deal with wind power generation uncertainty, a robust optimization approach is employed without the need for probability density function (PDF) or scenario generation, which strengthens the optimal operation of the proposed multi-energy MG against the wind power uncertainty and allows the operator to apply a risk-averse approach. Numerical results demonstrate that the establishment of IDR in the presence of storage systems reduces the total operating costs by 5.6%. Â© 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Interest in reducing the environmental impact of maritime shipping operations has recently been induced by the International Maritime Organization's latest set of regulations. Consequently, this study involves a macro-level view of the entire supply chain, emphasizing how liquefied natural gas exporters can reduce the environmental impact of shipping activities of energy commodities (LNG, hydrogen, ammonia and their blends) through greater uptake of cleaner fuel alternatives. This study tests the notion that demand for alternative fuels will continue to increase as the transportation sector integrates cleaner fuels to comply with increasing environmental regulations. Using Qatar as a case study, linear programming was used to develop a mathematical model where several scenarios are assessed, and the optimal combination of fuels sold, and bunker fuel consumed is determined. Firstly, by looking for maximum profit given the constraints imposed; secondly, by looking for minimal greenhouse gas emissions under the same constraints; and thirdly, by looking for maximum profit and minimum environmental impact. Results demonstrate that cleaner fuels can reduce emissions of maritime industry. While solving for minimal emissions regardless of profit, outcomes suggest that LNG is the most favourable fuel to sell due to the high demand and high production capacity, whereas NH3 is the most favourable for fuelling ships. This solution yielded a significant reduction of CO2 emissions as opposed to that expected from HFO. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

On-board emission measurements were carried out both for the main and auxiliary engines which are four-stroke medium speed diesel engines. The concentrations of NOx, SOx, CO, CO2, O-2, PM and HC were measured for various engine loads. The shaft power measurements were also performed. The weighted emission factors, monthly and annual emissions of the ferry are calculated using the experimental data. The weighted emission factors of NOx, SOx, CO, CO2, HC and PM emissions for the main engine are found to be 11.91 g/kWh, 0.10 g/kWh, 0.67 g/kWh, 611.14 g/kWh, 0.62 g/kWh and 0.079 g/kWh, respectively. For the auxiliary engine, the weighted emission factors of NOx, SOx, CO, CO2 and HC are respectively, 13.01 g/kWh, 0.11 g/kWh, 2.19 g/kWh, 641.69 g/kWh and 1.31 g/kWh. The amount of emissions from the ferry is found to be maximum in the summer season. The results show that the emission factors are the major parameter in the emission inventory studies and should be defined carefully. It is seen that the ship emissions, especially SO2 and PM emissions can be reduced substantially by using the ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel. Therefore, the sustainability of the maritime transport can be improved by utilizing the ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel for the propulsion of ships.

AB  - Coastal saline rice fields play an increasingly important role in rice production and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, few studies investigated the influences of nitrogen (N) fertilizer and soil ameliorant on GHG emissions simultaneously in this region. Thus, a field experiment was established to study the effects of different N fertilizers and soil ameliorant on global warming potential (GWP) and yield-scaled GHG intensity (GHGI) after accounting for carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), agrochemical inputs, and farm operations along with agronomic nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) during the rice season of 2016 in a coastal saline paddy in Lianyungang, China. The experiment was initiated with four N treatments (N0, no N; Nu, urea; Nm, organic-inorganic mixed fertilizer; Nw, organic fertilizer made from wheat straw) and two ameliorant (A) treatments (A0, no ameliorant; Al, 22.5 kg ha(-1) ameliorant). The results showed that three N fertilizers significantly increased the CH4 emissions, N2O emissions, GWP, and grain yield by 42.2\% (p < 0.001), 57.1\% (p < 0.001), 49.8\% (p < 0.001), and 58.9\% (p < 0.001), respectively. NuA1, NmA1, and NwA1 treatments obviously reduced the yield-scaled GHGI by 21.3\%, 16.3\%, and 12.4\%, respectively, relative to the corresponding NuA0, NmA0, and NwA0 treatments. Overall, although three N fertilizers would increase the GWP, combining an ameliorant amendment with N fertilizer can effectively reduce the yield-scaled GHGI and meanwhile increase the grain yield, particularly the NmA1 strategy.

TI  - Optimisation of hybrid renewable energy systems on islands: A review
JO  - Island Studies Journal
PY  - 2022
VL  - 17
IS  - 1
AB  - Access to energy services is recognised as a fundamental aspect of economic and social development. This is particularly important for isolated areas, where electrical supply is not guaranteed. Because of their inherent geographic characteristics, islands are prominent cases of isolated areas that must import and burn fossil fuels, with environmental and economic consequences. In this context, Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems (HRES) emerge as an alternative to traditional generation to reduce energy costs and environmental issues. This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing HRES on islands, based on energy optimisation. We present an extensive review of HRES optimisations across 73 island cases, collecting information about energy demand, energy system sizes, and optimisation methodologies. The most commonly proposed HRES components are identified, and a significant power relationship is found between population and annual energy demand on islands. Further, we identify islands with higher-than-expected and lower-than-expected consumption and the underlying causes. The main limitations of the reviewed studies are discussed, particularly with regards to availability and quality of hourly demand data and/or meteorological data required for renewable energy assessments. Several approaches to fill these gaps in information are reviewed here, concluding with a discussion of emergent methods and technologies.

TI  - The importance of exercise: Increased water velocity improves growth of Atlantic salmon in closed cages
JO  - Aquaculture
PY  - 2019
VL  - 501
IS  - NA
AB  - There is increasing concern about Norwegian salmon farming and the possible environmental impacts from sea lice, escaped fish and release of toxic chemicals and organic emissions to the coastal waters. Closed containment systems (CCS) have the potential to eliminate the problems with sea lice and to reduce escapes and emissions. When closing the cages, water volumes and velocity are regulated and the identification of optimal current velocities for growth and fish welfare from sea transfer to harvest size becomes necessary. This study describes two trials with LOW (0.10-0.27 BL/s) and MODERATE (0.36-0.63 BL/s) water velocity on performance of post-smolt Atlantic salmon in CCS. In trial 1 (168 days, 10.9 degrees C, fish size: 884-3007 g and 41.5-59.0 cm), round weight increased with 219 g (p = .012) and condition factor with 0.11 (p = .016) in the MODERATE group compared with LOW group. The MODERATE group obtained specific growth rate (SGR) of 0.76 and thermal growth coefficient (TGC) of 2.75, compared to 0.72 and 2.56 in the LOW group. MODERATE water velocity was also associated with higher relative heart size (RHS) (p = .016), higher liver index (HSI) (p = .005), increased fillet yield (p <= .001) and lower levels of cathepsin activity in muscle tissue. In trial 2 (46 days, 7.1 degrees C, fish size: 327-482 g and 29.9-33.7 cm), round weight increased with 52 g (p = .019) and condition factor with 0.05 (p = .009) in the MODERATE group compared with LOW group. The MODERATE group obtained SGR of 0.77 and TGC of 2.68, compared to SGR of 0.60 and TGC of 2.02 in the LOW group. No significant difference was observed in white muscle cell hyperplasia, measured as the proportion of small (< 20 mu m diameter) muscle fibres (p = .145). Both trials showed only minor differences in slaughter yield, fillet quality (protein, fat, water) and mortality. The present study shows that moderate water velocity (0.36-0.63 BL/s) is favourable for growth rates for Atlantic salmon during the entire on-growing period in CCS. Effects on a broader range of metabolic variables and welfare indicators were also documented.

AB  - In October 2016, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted mandatory fuel data reporting requirements by amending Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. Before the adoption of the IMO Data Collection System (IMO DCS), the European Union (EU) introduced a regulation requiring monitoring, reporting and verification of greenhouse gas emissions from ships as an initial step to inform further action. This regulation enabled the EU to include greenhouse gas emissions from shipping as a part of their collective climate change strategy, known as the EU MRV system. This article analyses the EU MRV system and the IMO DCS against standards of transparency and answerability. It argues that whilst neither the EU MRV system nor the IMO DCS promotes optimal transparency or answerability, the EU MRV represents a framework that comes closer to promoting answerability through transparency.

AB  - The use of fossil fuels is unsustainable due to limited supply and also due to large emissions of Carbon dioxide due to the effect of global warming. Biofuel is a viable option but can, as produced today; only provide a limited amount of fuels needed. Biofuels are presently derived from terrestrial plants, which require large amounts of arable land. Biofuels from microalgae on the other hand do not necessarily require arable land and can theoretically replace fossil fuels absolutely. Biofuels from microalgae could use industry waste water as growth medium particularly paper industry waste water is an interesting potential provider due to its high nitrogen and phosphorus in waste water. In this research work marine microalgae Nannochloropsis Salina was cultivated using f/2 medium using modified air lift photo-bioreactor along with the paper industry effluent waste water, The doubling time calculated from optical density attained at 48 hrs the cell count almost doubled during this period. Since the marine species is sensitive to pH we need to maintain the pH at 7 below 7indicated the decreased biomass levels in culture. The lipid extraction was studied using solvent methods. The functional compounds in lipids FAME were studied using GC-MS analysis, the Nannochloropsis salina showed qualities of growing in fresh water and brackish water apart from the marine water which is a desirable characteristic for algal phycoremediation.

In this context, we report the design of a piezoelectric energy harvesting system that can be used to harvest energy from the ocean. The harvester is composed of a piezoelectric cantilever structure and a magnet as the tip-mass of the piezoelectric module, atop which a rail (tube) with a metal ball is positioned. The system is tested with a setup that simulates ocean waves.

JO  - Journal Of Marine Science And Engineering
PY  - 2022
VL  - 10
IS  - 12
AB  - To increase the utilization of wave and other renewable energy resources, an integrated system consisting of an offshore wind turbine and a wave energy converter (WEC) could be used to harvest the potential energy. In this study, a dimensionless optimization method is developed for shape optimization of a hollow cylindrical WEC, and an optimal shape is obtained using a differential evolution (DE) algorithm. The frequency domain response characteristics of the WEC with different geometric shapes and viscous damping loads are studied. The numerical model of the wind-wave integrated system, which consists of a semisubmersible platform and the WEC, is developed and used. The dynamic responses of the integrated system with and without using the WEC optimum section are compared. The results show that the dimensionless optimization method utilized in this paper is very applicable for hollow cylindrical WECs. A smaller inner radius and larger draft increase the heave RAO amplitude of the WEC significantly. In addition, optimization of the WEC shape and power take-off (PTO) damping coefficient can significantly improve the energy capture of the integrated system, which increases by 32.03\%. The research results of this paper provide guidance for achieving the optimum design of offshore wind-wave energy integrated systems and quantify the benefits of using optimum designs in the produced wave energy power. In addition, the proposed dimensionless optimization method is generic and can be widely applied to different types of WECs.

In case of a seepage, previous researches indicate that behavior of seeping CO2 significantly depends on flow rate and bubble size, which are expected to be controlled by gas migration through unconsolidated marine sediments. In this study, gas-liquid-solid three phase flow 3D simulator was developed by coupling of LBM-DEM to predict those phenomena. Simulation results indicate that channel forming through unconsolidated layer affects the behavior of gas seepage and bubble forming, and the resultant bubble migration and dissolution in the sea-water column.

JO  - Natural Gas Industry

VL  - 33
IS  - 2
AB  - The development of LNG-powered vessels is of great significance to energy saving and emission reduction in inland waters shipping in China. In view of this, this paper first analyzes and predicts the shipping business trend, fuel consumption and LNG demand potential in China. Then, this paper makes an investigation into supply price of LNG resources, economical efficiency of LNG's being substitute for fuel oils, and the process of gas-powered vessels development. The following conclusions are drawn of the prospect of LNG as an alternative fuel for shipping vessels in China. (1) LNG is less competitive than fuel oils but more cost-effective than diesel. (2) In the future, LNG supply will satisfy the need of LNG as a vessel fuel and its price will be acceptable in the shipping business in China. (3) From both technical and economic points of view, LNG is a good alternative fuel for inland and offshore cargo ships and engineering ships, but not for fishing boats due to its small tonnage, short shipping time as well as fuel subsidies. (4) There are still many problems to solve in terms of legislation, technology, LNG supply on waters, etc. In general, the replacement of shipping vessel fuels by LNG will first go through a trial period of 2 - 3 years, then a start-up period of 2 - 3 years, and finally come into the business development. (5) With the possibility of this replacement and the process of market cultivation taken into account, it is predicted that the maximum demand volume of LNG as an alternative vessel fuel will be about 0. 6 billion m3 in 2015 and nearly 4 billion m 3 in 2020. In the end, this paper suggests that government departments in charge and the related enterprises should make overall plans and have a sense of ability to reasonably promote this project.

AB  - Offshore wind farms will experience significant growth over the coming decades. To ensure its sustainable development, it will be necessary to reduce the operation and maintenance costs associated with this technology, among other actions. To this end, the foundation is the most important structural element with the greatest economic impact on the project. To guarantee its correct operation and structural safety over time, an adequate maintenance plan informed by a comprehensive inventory is necessary. In this article, an inventory proposal for gravity-based support structures (GBS) is made. It is developed through a simple six-step methodology supported by data collected and analysed from seventeen wind farms with GBS foundations. The result indicates an inventory proposal for GBS foundations, with an innovative general structure that is organised in levels, and applicable to the most common GBS types currently used in the offshore wind energy sector. A procedure was created to complete the inventory, as well as an organisational structure for the management of the data generated during the process. The applicability and functionality of the inventory were tested against four case studies, and one of its potential applications in the field of maintenance strategies is shown. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

VL  - 265
IS  - NA
AB  - The maritime industry leading organization International Maritime Organization (IMO) is bringing more and more restrictive and effective rules on reducing greenhouse gas and air polluting emissions since the significant portion of the greenhouse gas emissions in the world are caused by commercial vessels. Therefore, an alternative energy source is seeking by maritime industry and fuel cells can play a major role in converting such energy sources into electrical energy. The aim of this study is to compare commercial fuel cell types that can be used in merchant ships and a maximum of 5 MW main engine power is considered due to the limited power output of fuel cells. The environmental and economical performances of fuel cell types were compared and criterionsâ€™ weightings were found according to expert points using the analytic hierarchy process. A final comparison table is formed giving evaluation points for each fuel cell type and weighting for each criterion depending on their importance in the maritime industry. Fuel cells are ranked by eight different criteria and according to experts, safety is the most important criterion and then followed by emissions, efficiency, cost, lifetime, power output, fuel type, and size, respectively. Among seven different fuel cell types; proton exchange membrane, alkaline, phosphoric acid, diesel oil using molten carbonate, liquefied natural gas using molten carbonate, diesel oil using solid oxide and liquefied natural gas using solid oxide fuel cells, the first three places are formed by diesel oil using molten carbonate fuel cell, proton exchange membrane fuel cell and diesel oil using solid oxide fuel cell which are received 4.053, 4.044 and 3.969 respectively from the total point 5.000. As a result, diesel oil using molten carbonate fuel cell, which takes place with a slight margin from proton exchange membrane fuel cell, has been found as the most suitable fuel cell type for ships. This study highlights that despite strict emission regulations, as a fuel, diesel oil is still a strong fuel option for ships with different energy conversion units like fuel cells.

AB  - This chapter examines the International Maritime Organisationâ€™s new shipping measures to reduce GHG and their intersection with other areas of international law and policy, following the adoption of the Paris Agreement. The chapter examines binding commitments to enhance energy efficiency on ships and reduce GHGs under MARPOL and framework policy measures under the IMO Initial Strategy adopted to position the IMO as the key regulator of GHG emission reduction in shipping. A key challenge at the intersection of shipping and climate regimes has been for the IMO to ensure standards common to all ships, in order to maintain a level playing field in shipping, yet also to implement the principle of common but differentiated responsibility under the UNFCCC regime. While capacity building measures now form an important element of the IMOâ€™s future work, there remains a lack of consensus on all elements of the strategy, such as how it relates to the IMO principles of non-discrimination and no more favourable treatment. The IMO Initial Strategy is important because it aligns the work of the IMO with the UN climate regime, incorporating ambitious targets for the phasing out of the GHG in shipping in the short and medium term. However, the IMO Initial Strategy is non-binding, so much will depend on how the IMO balances its climate ambitions with its role in securing maritime transport as a driver of global trade and development.

TI  - Community composition has greater impact on the functioning of marine phytoplankton communities than ocean acidification
JO  - Global Change Biology
PY  - 2014
VL  - 20
IS  - 3
AB  - Ecosystem functioning is simultaneously affected by changes in community composition and environmental change such as increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and subsequent ocean acidification. However, it largely remains uncertain how the effects of these factors compare to each other. Addressing this question, we experimentally tested the hypothesis that initial community composition and elevated CO2 are equally important to the regulation of phytoplankton biomass. We full-factorially exposed three compositionally different marine phytoplankton communities to two different CO2 levels and examined the effects and relative importance (Ï‰2) of the two factors and their interaction on phytoplankton biomass at bloom peak. The results showed that initial community composition had a significantly greater impact than elevated CO2 on phytoplankton biomass, which varied largely among communities. We suggest that the different initial ratios between cyanobacteria, diatoms, and dinoflagellates might be the key for the varying competitive and thus functional outcome among communities. Furthermore, the results showed that depending on initial community composition elevated CO2 selected for larger sized diatoms, which led to increased total phytoplankton biomass. This study highlights the relevance of initial community composition, which strongly drives the functional outcome, when assessing impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning. In particular, the increase in phytoplankton biomass driven by the gain of larger sized diatoms in response to elevated CO2 potentially has strong implications for nutrient cycling and carbon export in future oceans.

JO  - Renewable Energy
PY  - 2021
VL  - 179
IS  - NA
AB  - To fully extract the potential of offshore wind power, the wind farms are built further from mainland and the capacity is growing larger. Low Frequency AC (LFAC) transmission System is a promising solution to the integration of large offshore wind farms in long distance. This paper conducts a comparative economic analysis of LFAC. Compared to 50 Hz High Voltage AC (HVAC) transmission, LFAC can reduce charging current in AC cables to enhance the transmission ability in long distance. Compared to High Voltage DC (HVDC) transmission, LFAC eliminates the large expense of offshore converter station. In addition, the topologies of AC/AC converter in LFAC also influences the economic performance signifi-cantly. By designing typical AC/AC converters based on modular multilevel technique in a unified way, this paper performs a full-scale economic comparison in different voltage level, active power and reactive power cases. Furthermore, the economic comparison based on capital cost of HVAC, HVDC and LFAC is comprehensively studied considering different transmission capacity and the AC/AC converter topologies. The economic range of HVAC, LFAC and HVDC application is obtained, and results show that LFAC is suitable for medium distance circumstances (around 80-200 km). The economic range of LFAC expands when power rating increases. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

JO  - Energy Conversion And Management
PY  - 2020
VL  - 206
IS  - NA
AB  - With the continuous rise in world oil prices and increasing environmental awareness, how to improve ship energy efficiency and reduce ship pollution emissions has become a common concern of the shipping industry. Waste heat recovery technology is an effective method to improve the fuel economy of ships and help the future ships to meet the increasingly stringent Energy Efficiency Design Index of the International Maritime Organization. Under the thermodynamic analysis results of the 8S90ME-C10.2 low-speed marine diesel engine, this paper proposed a waste heat recovery scheme that combined the supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle power generation system with the Kalina cycle power generation system. According to the energy and exergy balances of the combined cycle system, a MATLAB program based on the REFPROP database was established. With the application of control variate method, the influence of the key operating parameters including the main compressor inlet temperature, the turbine inlet temperature, the main compressor outlet pressure, the expander inlet pressure, and the ammonia solution mass concentration on the system performance was thoroughly analyzed. Moreover, the multi-objective optimization matching between the diesel engine and the combined power generation system was carried out from the viewpoints of the thermodynamic performance and economic performance and the impact of the system on the fuel economy and the Energy Efficiency Design Index of the ship was calculated. The results showed that the combined power generation system was used to recycle the waste heat of diesel engine exhaust gas and bypass exhaust gas to generate electricity, which reduced the annual fuel consumption and the Energy Efficiency Design Index to 16.62\% and 15.01\%, respectively. Finally, this study provides a reference for researchers to study the combined use of supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle and Kalina cycle to recycle the waste heat of the marine diesel engine.

TI  - Impacts of the Increasingly Strict Sulfur Limit on Compliance Option Choices: The Case Study of Chinese SECA
JO  - Sustainability
PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 1
AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has proposed several environmental regulations on controlling SOx and NOx emissions from ships in coastal areas. Under the framework of IMO, some areas have established strict emission control areas (ECAs) to reduce emissions, which mainly contain Europe and North America. To further strengthen the control and supervision over air pollutants from shipping activities, the Sulfur cap regulation of 0.5\% by mass will come into effect on 1 January, 2020 globally, when all the sailing vessels on the high sea should use fuels with sulfur content less than 0.5\%. This limit is stricter for the global recognized sulfur emission control areas (SECAs), where it was 0.1\% since 1 January 2015. However, Chinese local SECA lags behind the globally recognized SECAs, where the 0.5\% Sulfur cap was implemented from 2016 and it has to be strengthened along with the global sulfur cap 2020. These increasingly stringent emission regulations have huge effects on shipping operators. The current study discusses the potential impacts of the stricter sulfur cap on operators' compliance option choices, where fuel-switching and scrubber system are analyzed under different sulfur limits. Meanwhile, the slow steaming practice is incorporated into the fuel-switching option by considering speed differentiation in different sulfur limit areas. This study develops a cost-minimizing model using NPV (net present value) method. It analyzes the optimal option within vessels' lifespan considering the tradeoff between the initial investment and future operational cost for newbuilding vessels based on a case study. In addition, emissions of CO2 and SOx are compared under different compliance options in different sulfur cap scenarios. Our results find that the scrubber system is a suitable option to comply with the 0.5\% global sulfur limit, and a higher efficiency of sulfur abatement can be attained by the scrubber system option. However, it emits more carbon emissions due to higher energy consumption used by the scrubber system. In addition, the effects of additional vessels deployed in the cycle on the compliance choices are also demonstrated in the analysis.

AB  - The environmental problems brought by the shipping industry have drawn the attention of all parties, making it critical to select a fuel system that combines economic and environmental benefits when ordering new ships. This paper narrows down a list of fuels to four high-potential options: LNG, methanol, hydrogen, and ammonia. Based on the dual perspectives of shipowners and the public, this study takes different-sized ships as the object, establishes mathematical models throughout their life cycle, and selects a variety of indicators to evaluate alternative fuels. The findings demonstrate that, in the short term, heavy fuel oil with scrubbers is the most economically advantageous option for all sizes of container ships, but methanol is a desirable alternative when taking into account the social cost of pollutants. Hydrogen might be the ultimate fuel to reduce emissions in the long run when the price gap closes. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Potential of a piezoelectric energy harvester from sea waves
JO  - Journal Of Sound And Vibration
PY  - 2014
VL  - 333
IS  - 5
AB  - A sea wave energy harvester from the longitudinal wave motion of water particles is developed. The harvester consisting of a cantilever substrate attached by piezoelectric patches and a proof mass is used to collect electrical energy owing to the electromechanical coupling effect of the piezoelectric patches from the longitudinal wave motion. To describe the energy harvesting process, a mathematical model is developed to calculate the output charge and voltage from the piezoelectric patches according to the Airy linear wave theory and classical elastic beam model. Results show that the mean value of the generated power increases with the increase in the ratio of the width to the thickness of the cantilever, the wave height, the sea depth (which equals to the cantilever height in this study), the ratio of the proof mass to the cantilever mass, and the ratio of the sea depth to the wave length. A value of the power up to 55 W can be realized for a practical sea wave with the values of the sea depth, wave height and wave length to be 3 m, 2 m, and 15 m, respectively. The collected power harvesting with respect to different categories of the sea waves are provided. Our simulations also show the generated electric power can be further increased by an increase in dimensions of the harvester considering the scale effect. This research develops a new technique for energy harvesting from sea waves by piezoelectric energy harvesters. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - THE MODELLING AND OPTIMAL CONTROL OF A HYBRID PROPULSION SYSTEM FOR AN ICE -CAPABLE SHIP
JO  - NANA

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Due to the effect of global warming, navigation on the Northern Sea Route (NSR) has become a more economical and reliable choice for international cargo transportation. In some ways, global warming has increased the opportunity of shipping activities in the Arctic region and hence the need for ice-capable vessels. NSR shipping provides benefits for international trade, but challenges still exist. Although conventional direct drive propulsion system connected to 2 stroke marine engine is normally considered the most efficient approach for long-range transport, for icebreaking operation which requires prime movers to work at partial load, conventional mechanical propulsion systems generally have poor fuel efficiency and high emissions. Moreover, the harmful gases produced by ships trading in NSR have a significant impact on the Arctic climate. Moreover, a traditional mechanical drive icebreaker with a diesel engine is required to operate at high torque, low rpm during icebreaking operation. Thus conventional diesel engine that isn't optimised to operate at this point would be inefficient and would produce black carbon due to incomplete combustion, which has the potential to cause ice, snow, and cloud albedo out of proportion with normal pattern, thus lead to serious impacts on the Arctic environment and eco-system. Arctic ship propulsion systems have been developing since the 19th century, with modifications such as the use of diesel electric propulsion systems and nuclear power propulsion systems which can ideally meet the requirements of ice breaking operation (low speed and high torque), however, drawbacks still exist in these systems, such as poor fuel efficiency at low speeds for diesel electric propulsion and for nuclear power, there are limitations such as high initial cost, management of nuclear waste and the fact that the required deep knowledge of nuclear technology is mastered by few countries. Hybrid propulsion is a new technology for ice-capable ships, which can address the partial loading efficiency problem in diesel-electric propulsion by charging and discharging a battery energy storage unit which can allow the ship to work in zero-emission mode in some sensitive areas. In this paper, detailed modelling, primary control strategies (voltage and frequency stability) and efficiency analysis of system components such as the motor, generator, battery and conversion devices etc. are and implemented in software, and then the whole power system is simulated with a secondary control strategy (load power sharing and battery aging concern) in both ice and open water load conditions. The results from the diesel electric system and hybrid system total fuel consumption within a target journey are compared to investigate the advantage of the hybrid system, which show up to a 40\% fuel consumption reduction for hybrid propulsion arrangement. A tertiary control strategy for energy management is analysed and implemented in the system to further reduce system fuel consumption.

AB  - To exploit various energy carriers simultaneously and optimal distribution of energy in smart electrical infrastructure, a smart energy hub (S. E. Hub) concept was emerged. Therefore, the S. E. Hub is an effective solution for creating an efficient energy system. This paper attempts to provide a new management framework for the smart island which consists of Smart Energy and Water Hub (S. E. W. Hub) and microgrid. Also, optimal planning of multiple energy infrastructures of S. E. W. Hub is done considering operational constraints. Furthermore, the impact of the microgrid which includes wind turbines (WTs), photovoltaic power plant (PVPP) and tidal generation on the optimal planning of the S. E. W. Hub is investigated. The planning minimizes the total investment and operation costs as well as the environmental pollutants costs. In the proposed management framework, the balancing of thermal, electrical and water energy is provided. Due to the uncertainties associated with the considered energy sources, an effective scenario-based method is provided to accurately model such uncertainty factors. The validation of the proposed approach is shown through different cases implemented on a real industrial building and the problem is solved in the GAMS environment using CPLEX solver.

JO  - Journal Of Molecular Liquids
PY  - 2023
VL  - 371
IS  - NA
AB  - Vast methane hydrates found in seabeds dispersed throughout ocean sediments and permafrost areas are a potential source of revenue as they act as an energy source. The encapsulation of carbon dioxide into the spaces occupied by methane molecules also creates a storage solution for greenhouse gases. This replacement reaction has two purposes; the first is energy release in the form of CH4 gas and the second is CO2 storage. This article presents experimental results on the CH4-CO2 replacement process using a. laboratory scale reactor with pure water and nanoparticles. Furthermore, the addition of nitrogen, as well as the use of thermal stimulation was studied experimentally to assess the enhancement of the replacement reaction. Additives such as graphene and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were utilized in the methane hydrate formation to further enhance the rate of hydrate formation. The experimental measurements show that a gas mixture of 80 mol%N2/20 mol%CO2 yields a CH4 replacement efficiency of 17.04 %, while 28.77 % replacement efficiency was the highest CH4 replacement efficiency obtained using thermal stimulation with pressurized CO2. The highest amount of CO2 sequestrated was 57.03 %. This was achieved via thermal stimulation with pressurized CO2. The lowest CO2 sequestrated was 10.57 % with 90 mol% CO2/10 mol%N2. The results confirm the significant improvements in CH4 hydrate formation, CH4 replacement efficiency, and CO2 sequestration ratio using graphene and SDS solutions. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

JO  - Continental Shelf Research
PY  - 2022

AB  - In September 2017, following passage of Typhoon Talim, daily satellite imagery captured a large area (âˆ¼300-km long and âˆ¼160-km wide) of high concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl a) that persisted for at least 8 days on the East China Sea (ECS) shelf. Ship-based measurements were conducted 5â€“6 days after the passage of Talim. Results showed that surface seawater within the area of high Chl a concentration had features of high salinity, low temperature, and low partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in comparison with surrounding seawater. The high Chl a concentration reflected a phytoplankton bloom triggered by upwelling nutrient-rich deeper water attributable to the passage of Typhoon Talim. The change in surface pCO2 in the area of high Chl a concentration was explained by the combined effects of upwelling deeper water and subsequent biological production. The airâ€“sea CO2 flux in the area of high Chl a concentration was âˆ’2.8 Â± 0.4 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1 in the post-typhoon stage, which turned the study area from near equilibrium (0.3 Â± 0.3 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1 in the surrounding water) to a moderate CO2 sink. This phytoplankton bloom absorbed 0.013 Tg C during the 8 days following the passage of Talim, effectively canceling out 28% of the typhoon-induced CO2 efflux during typhoon passage across the ECS. Therefore, the effect of typhoons on airâ€“sea CO2 flux in the post-typhoon stage cannot be ignored. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Traditionally, the environmental performance of marine systems in terms of exhaust emissions has never been among the primary concerns of the maritime industry. However, this situation is going to quickly change, as in the shipping sector Energy Efficiency Design and Operation IMO Indexes testify. In such a context it is worth mentioning that the greening of shipping operations can be effectively achieved by a suitable system design and energy management. Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) should be a tool to monitor and to optimize ship and fleet efficiency performance; as a consequence it will have a deep impact on the reduction not only of the exhaust gas emissions but also of the operational costs. To reach this goal energy modelling represents the keyword. In particular, the estimate by simulation, of onboard power generation, consumption and losses plays a fundamental role for driving, for instance, a decision support tool toward the optimal choices as far as energy management is concerned. To this purpose, in the paper the authors present the outcomes of the activities carried out to develop a simulation tool able to represent an overall ship system from the energetic point of view. Modelling approach and the results of numerical simulations performed by the authors to estimate vessel fuel consumption in a real case study are shown and discussed.

IS  - 1
AB  - Multifunction ships, naval vessels in particular, need to reduce fuel consumption while maintaining manoeuvrability. Hybrid propulsion that runs a main diesel engine and electric drive in parallel can achieve this. However, a parallel control strategy needs to be developed. In this paper, we use a simulation model of a hybrid propulsion system to investigate two parallel control strategies for diesel mechanical and electrical propulsion on multifunction ships. For the case study frigate, parallel control can increase the ship top speed with 3 kts when using two 4 MW electric drives and two 10 MW main diesel engines, compared with the same baseline hybrid propulsion without parallel control. The diesel engine speed control with electric drive torque control strategy increases ship acceleration rate with 17\% and reduces average engine thermal loading with 150 K. Moreover, the electric drive speed control with diesel engine torque control strategy can improve acceleration rate by 40\%, while eliminating thermal loading fluctuation due to heavy seas, and also reducing engine average thermal loading with 150 K. Future combination of the proposed electric drive speed control strategy with an adaptive pitch control and optimal power split strategy can potentially further increase hybrid propulsion plant performance.

PY  - 2016
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - The shipping industry is investigating alternative fuels for ships in order to comply with stricter emission requirements implemented by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a promising alternative since it could reduce emissions substantially and offer potential fuel cost savings. But the investment in LNG fuelled vessels is currently facing a high degree of uncertainty, such as the differential between the prices of LNG and conventional maritime fuels, the availability of LNG, and the reliability of its supply chain. This paper makes an attempt to study the possibility of investing in LNG powered vessels under uncertainty. A deferral option model is proposed to quantify the value of flexibility for a deferral based on multi-variables following specified stochastic processes. By exploiting the stochastic processes, it is possible to determine the value of deferral by solving a dynamic program using a least squares Monte Carlo simulation. The model is tested on an investment of a new chemical vessel with 19,000 deadweight tonnage (dwt) powered by LNG. Empirical analysis may suggest different investment strategies based on the probabilities of exercising an option, and related option values each year, and it indicates further that the attractiveness of LNG as a ship fuel is dominated by three parameters: difference of ship prices between a LNG powered vessel and a reference one, price difference between LNG and conventional fuel prices, and the share of operation time inside emission control areas (ECAs).

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - The wind turbine has become an efficient way for clean energy. For offshore wind turbine in a sandy area, the monopile is a widely used foundation type under proper water depths. During the life time, monopiles are subjected to millions of cyclic loads from winds and waves and scouring around the pile is a common phenomenon, both of which can influence the operation safety of the offshore turbine. To study the coupled effects of cyclic loading and scouring on the horizontally loaded pile, a series of horizontal monotonic and cyclic loading tests on model piles were carried out in sandy soil. The influence of pile diameter, cyclic loading amplitude, and scour depth on the long-term residual accumulated displacements of a monopile is investigated. The test results show that the deformation mode of pile and the dilatancy of sand result in different static responses of the pile. A quantised work is presented to estimate the accumulated residual displacements of the pile, in which the effects of the three factors can be expressed in a united expression. Since the lateral capacity is a crucial parameter for the normalisation in regression analysis, the confirmation of a lateral capacity should be related to the corresponding concern in practical projects.

AB  - Ship emissions reduction targets are forcing the maritime transportation industry on the way to replacing conventional marine fuel oil with cleaner fuels. This is especially significant for ocean-going vessels that carry huge cargo such as container ships. Therefore, the present paper aims to perform environmental and energy efficiency analysis for the utilization of liquefied natural gas (LNG) instead of conventional marine fuel to reduce the carbon-footprint and enhance the energy efficiency of container ships. In this study, the environmental analysis is based on the calculation of ship emissions released by using dual-fuel engine powered by LNG and compared with that released by conventional ones. The results show that the conversion process has achieved a 30\% reduction in carbon dioxide, 81\% reduction in nitrogen dioxide and 97\% reduction in sulfur oxide. While the ship's energy efficiency is assessed by using the design index which shows that LNG can comply with the current rules and future ones.

TI  - Natural iron fertilization of the coastal ocean by ``blackwater rivers{''
JO  - Science Of The Total Environment
PY  - 2019
VL  - 656
IS  - NA
AB  - The present study elucidates the role of natural iron fertilization of the coastal ocean by so-called ``blackwater rivers{''}. Areas of marsh, fen, peatland, boreal forest etc. are characterized by organic-rich soils. From those soils, humic substances (humic and fulvic acids) are leached to the aquatic system resulting in river water that is low in pH and dark-brown in color. The point is that ``blackwater rivers{''} tend to be rich in dissolved iron due to the unique chelating properties of humic and fulvic acids which bind Fe(III) and keep it in solution. We performed algal physiological (growth rate) experiments under conditions of iron deficiency with the marine unicellular phytoplankton algae Chlorella salina and Diacronema lutheri in 0.2 mu m cut-off filtered mixtures of natural ``blackwater river{''} water and synthetic seawater. Our results demonstrate that the iron naturally present in ``blackwater rivers{''} is readily bioavailable to bothmarine algal species. Further more, the humic and fulvic acids exert an additional stimulatory effect on the marine algae. Both algae thrive much better in the presence of natural humic and fulvic acids as compared to a mediumwhere EDTA is used as an iron-chelating agent. Our results indicate that ``blackwater rivers{''}, in sharp contrast to other types of rivers, are excellent sources of bioavailable iron to marine phytoplankton. This natural iron fertilization may give rise to photosynthesis-driven sequestration of CO2 from the atmosphere to the sea, as can be seen from the visualization of CO2 surface concentrations by NASA (NASA GEOS-5 model) which shows the global sources and sinks of CO2 localized in time and space. The results by NASA suggest that strong marine CO2 sinks in coastal waters tend to occur close to ``blackwater river{''} estuaries. It is thus evident that ``blackwater rivers{''} act as important sources of a limiting nutrient (iron) to the ocean. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

PY  - 2017
VL  - 10

AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) and some countries have gradually strengthened the laws regulating ship exhaust emissions. The aim of this paper is to estimate the impact of an after-treatment technology exhaust gas cleaning (EGC) system on marine diesel engine emissions and the cost advantage compared to using low-sulfur fuel oil. The emission characteristics of SO2 and particulate matter (PM) produced from high sulfur oil and low sulfur oil in a low-speed two-stroke marine diesel engine were also presented. The removal efficiency of SO2 has been tested and the PM removal efficiency was also predicted in this study. When using high sulfur oil, the emission factor of SO2 and PM were from 8.73 g/kWh to 11.6 g/kWh and 2.0 g/kWh to 2.7 g/kWh, respectively. These values are significantly higher than the emission values from using low sulfur oil. The fuel sulfur content (FSC) was the key factor affecting the emission factors of SO2 and PM. The fuel change could reduce the mass emission factor of PM, which is above 90\% for the total particle emission with the two fuels. When using the EGC system, the desulfurization efficiencies were above 99\%. The pH values at a 25, 39, 53, and 67\% load were also stabilized to be around 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, and 8, respectively. The EGC system can also capture part of the primary PM and secondary PM formed from SO2. The EGC system was more effective for PM of the size larger than 1 mu m. Thus, according to this study, the usage of low sulfur oil and EGC will also substantially decrease the emission of currently unregulated hazardous chemical species in the exhaust gas of ships in addition to satisfying future emissions regulations of ship. Furthermore, the EGC system also had a significant cost advantage compared to using low-sulfur fuel oil.

TI  - Optimization modelling of the impacts of a Severn Barrage for a two-way generation scheme using a Continental Shelf model
JO  - Renewable Energy
PY  - 2014
VL  - 72
IS  - NA
AB  - The Severn Estuary has the world's second largest tide range and a barrage across the estuary, located just seawards of Cardiff in Wales and Weston in the South West England, has been proposed for over half a century, with the objective of extracting large amounts of tidal energy. A Severn Barrage, as previously proposed by the Severn Tidal Power Group (STPG), would be the largest renewable energy project for tidal power generation in the world, if built as proposed, and would generate approximately 5% of the UK's electricity needs. However, concerns have been raised over the environmental impacts of such a barrage, including potential increase in flood risk, loss of intertidal habitats etc. In addressing the challenges of maximizing the energy output and minimizing the environmental impacts of such a barrage, this research study has focused on using a Continental Shelf model, based on the modified Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) with a barrage operation module (EFDC_B), to investigate both the far and near field hydrodynamic impacts of a barrage for different operating scenarios. Three scenarios have been considered to simulate the Severn Barrage, operating via two-way generation and using different combinations of turbines and sluices. The first scenario consisted of 216 turbines and 166 sluices installed along the barraâ‰¥ the second consisted of 382 turbines with no sluices; and the third consisted of 764 turbines and no sluices. The specification of the sluice gates and turbines are the same for all scenarios. The model results indicate that the third scenario has the best mitigating effects for the far-field and near-field flood risks caused by a barrage and produces the most similar results of minimum water depth and maximum velocity distributions to those obtained from simulating the natural conditions of the estuary, i.e. the current conditions. The results also show that the flow patterns around the barrage are closest to those for the existing natural conditions with minimal slight changes in the estuary. Thus, the results clearly indicate that the environmental impacts of a Severn Barrage can be minimized if the barrage is operated for two-way generation and under the third scenario. Although it appears that the energy output for the third scenario is less than that obtained for the other two scenarios, if very low head (VLH) turbines are used, then the third scenario could generate more energy as more turbines could be cited along the barrage structure. Therefore, the study shows that a Severn Barrage, operating in two-way generation and with 764 turbines (ideally VLH turbines), would be the best option to meet the needs of maximizing the energy output, but having a minimal impact on environmental changes in the estuary and far-field.

AB  - The effect of using an additive based on alumina nanoparticles and oleic acid to reduce the environmentally harmful gas emissions from biodiesel and its blends in diesel. Of all this, the physic-chemical properties of the blended fuels were calculated with the help of correlations of colloidal particles and blending rules, setting additive levels of 10, 20, and 50 ppm. The results showed decreases in emissions of sulfur dioxide and particulate matter, respectively, whereas carbon dioxide emissions recorded no significant improvement but any changes in actual fuel efficiency. For nitrogen dioxide emissions, an increase was observed with the implementation of the specific concentrations of nanoadditives; these were illustrated by improvements in the delay of the ignition times, which would be appropriate for proper operation of the engine.

TI  - USE OF MACROALGAE FOR MARINE BIOMASS PRODUCTION AND CO2 REMEDIATION - A REVIEW
JO  - Journal Of Applied Phycology

VL  - 6
IS  - 1
AB  - Biomass production from macroalgae has been viewed as important mainly because of the need for pollution abatement. Environmental considerations will increasingly determine product and process acceptability and drive the next generation of economic opportunity. Some countries, including Japan, are actively promoting `'green'' technologies that will be in demand worldwide in the coming decades. Should an international agreement on CO2-reduction be ratified, its effective use for energy production would be of high priority. This report shows that macroalgae have great potential for biomass production and CO2 bioremediation. Macroalgae have high productivity, as great or greater than the most productive land plants, and do not compete with terrestrial crops for farm land. The review focuses on recent data on productivity, photosynthesis, nutrient dynamics, optimization and economics. Biomass from macroalgae promises to provide environmentally and economically feasible alternatives to fossil fuels. Nevertheless, the techniques and technologies for growing macroalgae on a large-scale and for converting feedstocks to energy carriers must be more fully developed.

AB  - It was determined carbon sequestration potencial in mangrove forest soil located within the natural protected area named "TÃ©rminos Lagoon" in Carmen Island, Campeche-MÃ©xico. Six sampling zones were considered within a mangrove forest located in the Botanical Garden of the Autonomous University of Carmen City. Samplings were carried out from February to August during 2009 considering three climatic periods ("Norths" season, dry season and rainy season). The seasonal influence on carbon storage was evident (from 1.2 to 22.2 kg C / m-2), with the highest rate of carbon sequestration in the dry season, in flooded soils with greater predominance of red mangrove, and is lower in those soils rarely flooded with a higher prevalence of buttonwood mangrove individuals. The organic matter content and organic carbon was greater at 30 cm depth for flooded areas, where long periods of flood tides and low rates of decomposition maintain anoxic conditions. The sandy soils of the study areas with high pH values and red mangrove associations have a high potential for carbon sequestration and we can conclude that it can be increased in future years.

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) mandatory requirement for Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) has been in place since 01 January 2015 to address emission and global warming concerns. This regulation must be satisfied by newly-built ships with 400 gross tonnages and above. In addition, the MEPC-approved 2013 guidance, ISO 15016 and ISO 19019 on EEDI serves the purpose for calculation and verification of attained EEDI value. As such, verification should be carriedout through an acceptable method during sea trial and this demands extensive planning during propulsion power system design stage. Power and speed assessment plays the important factor in EEDI verification. The shaft power can be determined by telemeter system using strain gage while the ship speed can be verified and calibrated by differential ground positioning system (DGPS). An actual measurement was carried-out on a newly-built ship during sea trial to assess the correlation between speed and power. In this paper, the Energy-efficiency Design Index or Operational Indicator Monitoring System (EDiMS) software developed by the Dynamics Laboratory-Mokpo National Maritime University (DL-MMU) and Green Marine Equipment RIS Center (GMERC) of Mokpo National Maritime University was utilized. Mainly, EDiMS software employs four channels - engine speed, ship speed, shaft power and fuel consumption - for the verification process. In addition, the software can continuously monitor air pollution and is a suitable tool for inventory and ship energy management plan. Ships greenhouse gas inventory can likewise be obtained from the base of emission result during the engine shop test trial and the actual monitoring of shaft power and ship speed. It is suggested that an integrated equipment and compact software be used in EEDI verification. It is also perceived that analog signals improve the measurement accuracy compared to digital signal. Other results are presented herein. Â© 2016 The Vietnam Maritime University.

JO  - International Journal Of Energy And Environmental Engineering

VL  - NA

AB  - The identification of offshore wind farms necessitates the consideration of multiple factors, including technical, social, economic, and ecological ones, amongst others. In the current study, a multi-criterial model is applied by incorporating wind speed, water depth, grid proximity, tourism activities, and marine spatial constraint factors to determine optimum sites for offshore wind farm placements in the Republic of Mauritius. The North-Eastern region, off the coast of Grand Gaube, has been found to be promising, with an annual electricity potential of 1650Â GWh, owing to favourable wind regime of about 7.95Â m/s at 100Â m height. Moreover, the site location, at an average water depth of 38Â m, favours the adoption of conventional jacket foundation. A levelized cost analysis reveals that the electricity generated from the offshore farm would be priced at $163/MWh, which makes it cost-competitive as compared to heavy fuel oil at $218/MWh. A scenario looking at the installation of a 608Â MW offshore wind plant, which represents the theoretical maximum that may be attained in the optimum region identified, revealed that exploitation of this site has the potential to decrease up to 1.5 times the share of imported fuel oil and diesel for electricity needs. Besides providing guidelines for the implementation of offshore wind technology in Mauritius, the paper reflects on important gaps for adoption, including factors that seek to ease policy uptake.

AB  - The imminent development of a number of offshore wind farms in the Republic of Ireland presents a sizable opportunity to stimulate the Irish economy through the growth of an indigenous and globally competitive offshore wind supply chain. This study uses a value chain analysis to evaluate the economic and employment potential of the offshore wind sector for Ireland. The analysis is based on the expenditure on products and services required to develop an offshore wind farm, the planned capacity of projects in the pipeline, and the ability of Irish companies to supply the sector. Results suggest that by 2030, 2.5â€“4.5GW of domestic offshore wind development could create between 11,424 and 20,563 supply chain jobs and generate between â‚¬763 m and â‚¬1.4bn in gross value added.

TI  - Low carbon maritime transport: How speed, size and slenderness amounts to substantial capital energy substitution
JO  - Transportation Research Part D: Transport And Environment
PY  - 2015
VL  - 41
IS  - NA
AB  - Three responses that reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions in maritime transport are slower speeds, larger vessels and slender hull designs. We use crude oil carriers as our illustrative example; these represent nearly a quarter of international sea cargo movements. We estimate the potential and costs in these which can all be described as capital substituting for energy and emissions. At different degrees of flexibility and time scales: speed reductions are feasible immediately when there are vessels available, though more capital will be tied up in cargo. Deployment of larger and more slender vessels to a greater extent requires fleet renovation, and also investments in ports and infrastructure. A novel finding in our analysis is that if bunker costs rise as a result of emission costs (fees, quotas), then this may depress speeds and emissions more than if they result from higher oil prices. The reason is that for higher oil prices, more capital tied up in cargo may give cargo owners an interest in speeding up, partly counteracting the impulse from fuel costs that tends to slow vessels down. Emission costs, in contrast, do not raise cargo values. Â© 2015 The Authors.

AB  - As International Maritime Organization set 2030 and 2050 targets to reduce CO2 emissions in maritime sector, the investigation of innovative clean solution as hydrogen fuel cells for clean energy generation onboard is gaining more and more value. The present study investigates the thermal integration between PEM fuel cells and metal hydrides (for hydrogen storage) on board the first Italian zero-emissions ship with hydrogen and batteries propulsion, named ZEUS, built by Fincantieri Yard and launched in 2022. A model-based approach is developed to ensure the system's control at different load demands for the vessel, including transient conditions. The study focuses on the most critical conditions for fuel cells during navigation, namely from maximum to minimum power and vice-versa. Load reduction does not imply particular issues, while load maximum increase may cause some problems in terms of stability, negatively affect fuel cell stacks lifetime. Three solutions are investigated and compared to solve the problem to achieve a safe and robust control system: (i) decrease the current ramp for fuel cells from 50 to 10 A/s; (ii) introduce an intermediate load step; (iii) adopt an advanced Model Predictive Control strategy.

AB  - Young unconsolidated terrigenous sediments represent the general geological context where the main offshore Adriatic fields are located. In such geological environment, sea floor subsidence, caused by hydrocarbon extraction, could eventually occur. In Italy in order to prevent any possible impact of the hydrocarbon production activities on coastal areas environments and infrastructures, before starting-up a new hydrocarbon off-shore development project, a monitoring plan to measure and analyse total subsidence evolution has to be submitted to the Italian Authorities. Though many tools are available for subsidence monitoring onshore, few are available for offshore monitoring. ENI, in order to fill the gap, conducted a research program, with different suppliers, to generate a monitoring system tool to measure seafloor subsidence. Advanced feasibility studies have been carried out with three different companies: Company 1; Company 2 and an Italian company, AGISCO, operating in the field of geotechnical instrumentation and consulting. Company 1 and Company 2 proposed the use of interesting technologies (respectively based on fiber optics and electrical tiltmeters), but with a technology readiness level lower than AGISCO's one, that proposed an advanced solution based on already available industrial components and easily implemented up to desired size. The AGISCO proposed tool was based on the internal cable altitude-dependent pressure changes, measured using pressure transducers. The AGISCO tool had already several applications on shore in dry/semi-dry places, but has never been applied to offshore subsidence monitoring for oil and gas industry. The company, in 2015, built for ENI the first prototype of the tool. The tool, according to ENI technical specifications resulted as a robust cable, with variable outside diameter (from 40 to 140 mm) and 100m interval spaced measuring points. The paper, through the design of instruments from the three companies, describes the process that has led to the choice of Agisco tool and outlines the future steps that will have to be taken towards the installation of the tool.

JO  - International Journal Of Marine Energy
PY  - 2016
VL  - 16

AB  - Tidal energy is a renewable resource that can contribute towards meeting growing energy demands, but uncertainties remain about environmental impacts of device installation and operation. Environmental monitoring programs are used to detect and evaluate impacts caused by anthropogenic disturbances and are a mandatory requirement of project operating licenses in the United States. In the United Kingdom, consent conditions require monitoring of any adverse impacts on species of concern. While tidal turbine sites share similar physical characteristics (e.g. strong tidal flows), similarities in their biological characteristics have not been examined. To characterize the generality of biological attributes at tidal energy sites, metrics derived from acoustic backscatter describing temporal and spatial distributions of fish and macrozooplankton at Admiralty Inlet, Washington State and the Fall of Warness, Scotland were compared using t-tests, F-tests, linear regressions, spectral analysis, and extreme value analysis (EVA). EVA was used to characterize metric values that are rare but potentially associated with biological impacts, defined as relevant change as a consequence of human activity. Pelagic nekton densities were similar at both sites, as evidenced by no statistically significant difference in densities, and similar daily density patterns of pelagic nekton between sites. Biological characteristics were similar, suggesting that generic biological monitoring programs could be implemented at these two sites, which would streamline permitting, facilitate site comparison, and enable environmental impact detection associated with tidal energy deployment.

AB  - Chemical and stable carbon isotopic modifications during the freezing of artificial seawater were measured in four 4 m(3) tank incubations. Three of the four incubations were inoculated with a nonaxenic Antarctic diatom culture. The 18 days of freezing resulted in 25 to 27 cm thick ice sheets overlying the residual seawater. The ice phase was characterized by a decrease in temperature from -1.9 to -2.2 degreesC in the under-ice seawater down to -6.7 degreesC in the upper 4 cm of the ice sheet, with a concurrent increase in the salinity of the under-ice seawater and brine inclusions of the ice sheet as a result of physical concentration of major dissolved salts by expulsion from the solid ice matrix. Measurements of pH, total dissolved inorganic carbon (C-T) and its stable isotopic composition (delta(13)C(T)) all exhibited changes, which suggest minimal effect by biological activity during the experiment. A systematic drop in pH and salinity-normalized C-T by up to 0.37 pH(SWS) units and 376 mumol C kg(-1) respectively at the lowest temperature and highest salinity part of the ice sheet were coupled with an equally systematic C-13 enrichment of the C-T. Calculations based on the direct pH and C-T measurements indicated a steady increase in the in situ concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2(aq)) with time and increasing salinity within the ice sheet, partly due to changes in the dissociation constants of carbonic acid in the low temperature-high salinity range within sea ice. The combined effects of temperature and salinity on the solubility of CO2 over the range of conditions encountered during this study was a slight net decrease in the equilibrium CO2(aq) concentration as a result of the salting-out overriding the increase in solubility with decreasing temperature. Hence, the increase in the in Situ CO2(aq) concentration lead to saturation or supersaturation of the brine inclusions in the ice sheet with respect to atmospheric pCO(2) (approximate to3.5 X 10(-4) atm). When all physico-chemical processes are considered, we expect CO2 degassing and carbonate mineral precipitation from the brine inclusions of the ice sheet, which were saturated or highly supersaturated with respect to both the anhydrous (calcite, aragonite, vaterite) and hydrated (ikaite) carbonate minerals.

AB  - Maritime transportation has been a cost-effective option among other transport modes. Meanwhile, this demand has been increasing day by day because of the expanding global economy. The ships are one of the most important transport and trade vehicles in the world; 90% of the world trade is carried out by maritime transport, and this sector plays a crucial role in climate change and global warming because it is one of the key sectors leading to emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas (GHG). In other sectors that lead to CO2 emissions, i.e., energy production, manufacturing industry, and heating in residences, energy efficiency has been improved and emissions have been reduced significantly. However, there has been no net reduction in the transport sector; total CO2 emissions have also increased because of the continuous increase in freight and passenger traffic, although efficiency has increased. Increasing the energy efficiency of a ship allows for fuel consumption reduction and GHG emissions. In this study, the energy system of a chemical tanker ship was analyzed and then modeled by using the long-range energy alternatives planning system, a widely used platform for energy policy analysis and climate change mitigation assessment, including a comprehensive energy flow diagram, namely, reference energy system. A base scenario was developed, and the ship's energy systemwas convenient to be analyzed and evaluated in terms of technical, economic, and environmental aspects, including low-emission development strategies, to comply with marine engine regulations of the International Maritime Organization.

An investigation of the fatigue load spectra of the wind turbines was performed enabling a detailed evaluation besides the damage equivalent load. Therefore, load spectra of a turbine in free-stream and a turbine experiencing wake inflow conditions were compared. Atmospheric stability was taken into account by means of the Bulk Richardson number. It was shown, how atmospheric stability affects load spectra of tower base and blade root bending moment. Hereby, it was found that few events of high fatigue loading increase the damage equivalent load (DEL) substantially, especially in unstable conditions.

AB  - The growing threat of global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels has led scientists to explore solutions such as underground injection of CO2. Possible alternatives for CO2 storage include the oceans, deep saline reservoirs and depleted oil and gas reservoirs. One of the key issues to be addressed with regard to underground reservoir storage is CO2 loss from storage due to leakage through faults and fractures in the geological structure. Thus, while flow Of CO2 gas and water or oil through fractures is anticipated to occur, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding prediction of flow phenomena. Complicated gas-liquid flow phenomena in geologically varied domains are also expected during CO2 injection. This paper presents the experimental and numerical results on the two-phase flow phenomena in a simulated single fracture. The bubbly flow in the fracture was obtained and bubble properties were studied. It is found that the bubbly flow features frequent bubble coalescence. The influence of flow rate of both phases on the bubble size and velocity is also presented. A transient laminar model was established to simulate a case of an experimental bubbly flow. In order to reconstruct the twophase interface, a geometric reconstruction scheme of volume of fluid (VOF) model was adopted. Simulated bubbly flow has the same feature observed from experimental work.

AB  - Alternative, and especially renewable, marine fuels are needed to reduce the environmental and climate impacts of the shipping sector. This paper investigates the business case for hydrogen as an alternative fuel in a new-built vessel utilizing fuel cells and liquefied hydrogen. A real option approach is used to model the optimal time and costs for investment, as well as the value of deferring an investment as a result of uncertainty. This model is then used to assess the impact of a carbon tax on a ship owner's investment decision. A low carbon tax results in ship owners deferring investments, which then slows the uptake of the technology. We recommend that policymakers set a high carbon tax at an early stage in order to help hydrogen compete with fossil fuels. A clear and timely policy design promotes further investments and accelerates the uptake of new technologies that can fulfill decarbonization targets. Â© 2022 The Author(s)

The next presenter, who is working on the evolution of climate change, air pollution, and anti-trust policy, concluded that understanding of carbon capture and storage is quite low in the public level of awareness. The third presenter who is working on policy analysis on environmental issues, especially on climate change and air pollution, discussed the implications of carbon capture and storage. The fourth presenter, who is working on the carbon dioxide sequestration, discussed on ways to foster public acceptance regarding CO2 sequestration in aquifers. Finally, the last presenter discussed on the public perceptions of carbon dioxide disposal. She suggested that general public had a relative preference for geological over oceanic disposal of CO2.

AB  - The achievement of a radical global reduction of greenhouse gases requires a legal-institutional setting capable of facilitating such a transition on a wide range of renewable technologies. This paper identifies and critically evaluates the key institutional, procedural and substantive legal mechanisms facilitating or preventing sustainable production of blue renewable energy with Finland as a case study country. The focus is on offshore wind power and hydropower. While we approach energy transition from the perspective of an EU member state, we simultaneously shed light on the relevant parts of the EU legal framework that significantly affect national legal frameworks.

AB  - Significant expansion of global food supply will require new advancements of similar impact to the Green Revolution. The Ultimate Ocean Ranch envisions enhancement of open-sea biological productivity through artificial upwelling of deep-ocean nutrients by means of ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC); food products will be derived by management of integrated ``floating grazing platforms,{''} which could also enhance atmospheric carbon dioxide sequestration and net oxygen production in the photic zone. Some of the required technologies exist; some must be developed. Commercialization of the concept will be required; this in turn will require the fullest possible integration of value-generating activities. We estimate, from typical ecological parameters and from some assumptions that can only be evaluated through research, that about \$ 3.3 M in aquatic food products could be produced annually from the water-pumping capability of a hypothetical 10-MW OTEC plant. This is not a large return on investment, but it precedes research and engineering development; other values will be generated. The urgency of the food problem and the lack of nullifying obstacles indicates further evaluation of this concept.

AB  - Nowadays, with the higher voice of ship energy saving and emission reduction, the research on energy efficiency management is particularly necessary. Energy efficiency management and control of ships is an effective way to improve the ship energy efficiency. In this paper, according to the new clean propulsion system configurations of 5000 tons of bulk carrier, the energy efficiency management control strategy of the clean propulsion system is designed based on the model of advanced brushless doubly-fed shaft generator, propulsion system using LNG/diesel dual fuel engine and energy consumption of the main engine for reducing energy consumption. The simulation model of the entire propulsion system and the designed control strategy were designed. The influence of the engine speed on the ship energy efficiency was analyzed, and the feasibility of the energy efficiency management control strategies was verified by simulation using Matlab/Simulink. The results show that the designed strategies can ensure the power requirement of the whole ship under different conditions and improve the ship energy efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions.

AB  - The concept of eco-maintenance aims to prolong the lifetime of the system to maintain while minimizing environmental losses due to maintenance. This concept is developed for renewable energy production system (Reps) like wind turbines or photovoltaic panel. REPS generate clean and inexhaustible energy. However the production of this energy is unpredictable because it depends on the weather. Moreover failures that occur on the means of production make the operation less interesting. However the implementation of technical resources (fault detection sensor, vehicles and transfer system for technicians, tools and spare parts) improves the performance of the production system. In this paper a model for REPS with an application on wind energy production system (offshore wind farm + maintenance systems) was developed and simulations have been performed. Hence we show the importance to design and optimize the maintenance the REPS for reducing cost and environmental issues. Â© 2016, Springer-Verlag France.

TI  - An optimally-controlled RANS Actuator force model for efficient computations of tidal turbine arrays
JO  - Ocean Engineering
PY  - 2020
VL  - 212
IS  - NA
AB  - A steady-state Actuator force model using the RANS equations is developed to calculate the power production and the flow through arrays of tidal or river Darrieus turbines. It uses detailed three dimensional force distributions depending on the position on the turbine, obtained beforehand by a set of blade-resolved URANS simulations of the turbine. New power coefficient and force coefficient laws depending on the local velocity instead of the upstream velocity are established and appear to be independent from the local turbine blockage in an array. Those laws are used to construct a model that adapt the Actuator force distributions to the local velocity of the flow reaching each turbine, in order to simulate each turbine functioning close to its maximum efficiency point. The model is validated against experimental measurements on a reduced-scale Darrieus turbine. A fence farm configuration and a two row farm configuration are investigated and compared to results of the same model adapted in two dimensions. The local blockage effect is more favorable for fences than for staggered turbine configurations, increasing the local velocity and the power production for each turbine. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Carbon dioxide capture using liquid absorption methods: a review
JO  - Environmental Chemistry Letters
PY  - 2021
VL  - 19
IS  - 1
AB  - Anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is inducing global warming, ocean acidification, polar ice melting, rise in sea level, droughts and hurricanes, thus threatening human health and the global economy. Therefore, there is a need to develop cost-effective technologies for CO(2)capture. For instance, solution absorption is promising due to a large processing capacity, high flexibility and reliability, and rich experience in engineering applications. Nonetheless, actual commercial solutions, solvents and processes for CO(2)capture suffer from slow reaction kinetics, low absorption capacity, high-energy consumption, susceptibility to corrosion, toxicity, low stability and high costs. Therefore, current research focuses on developing more economical, effective, green and sustainable technologies. Here we review 2015-2020 findings on CO(2)capture using liquid absorption methods. Methods are based on various solutions, solvents and processes such as carbonate solution, ammonia solution, amine-based solution, ionic liquid, amino acid salt, phase changing absorbent, microcapsulated and membrane absorption, nanofluids and phenoxide salt solution. We discuss absorption performance, absorption mechanism, enhancement pathways and challenges. Amine- and NH3-based absorbents are widely used, yet they are limited by high regeneration energy, corrosiveness and degradation, reagent loss and secondary pollution caused by NH(3)escape. Phase changing absorbents are getting more attention due to their lower cost and lower energy penalty. The incorporation of membrane and microencapsulation technologies to absorbing solvents could enhance CO(2)absorption performance by reducing corrosion and increasing selectivity. Adding nanoparticles to solvents could improve CO(2)absorption performance and reduce energy requirement. Besides, solvent blends and promoter-improved solvents performed better than single and non-promoted solvents because they combine the benefits of individual solvents and promoters.

JO  - Plant Science Today
PY  - 2019
VL  - 6
IS  - 2
AB  - Seagrass ecosystems are considered as major blue carbon sinks, thus contributing directly to the mitigation of climate change by storing carbon in their habitats. However, empirical data for carbon stocks in Malaysia seagrass meadow sediment remain unreported in a standardised format. This paper presents data on organic (OC) and inorganic carbon (IC) stocks, and stable isotope signatures of carbon (Î´ 13 C) in bulk seagrass sediments collected from Sungai Pulai estuary (Johor, Malaysia). Within this estuary, seagrasses form shoals at Tanjung Adang and Merambong. Organic carbon and Î´ 13 C values in bulk sediment were analysed by an elemental analyser and a continuous flow isotope-ratio mass spectrometer, respectively, while sediment IC data was derived from loss-on-ignition calculations of sample mass differences. The data from these samples are presented as downcore profile of OC (values range at 0.14% to 2.49%), IC (0.16% to 5.29%), Î´ 13 C values of organic matter (- 27.9 to -20.4), and cumulative carbon stocks (1.03-3.39 kg OC m -2 and 0.76-2.84 kg IC m -2 ) in the top 30 cm of sediments. This dataset is applicable for regional and local blue carbon studies, which would allow insights into carbon sink and carbon cycling capacity, in addition to gaining insights into the provenances of carbon stored in seagrass meadows.

JO  - Sunflowers: Cultivation, Nutrition, And Biodiesel Uses
PY  - 2011
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Since more than 960 million people in the world are suffering from chronic hunger, a growing concern is whether farmers will switch to biofuel production to the detriment of food security. However, there is a fundamental difference between sunflowers and other crops such as maize, wheat, etc.: biodiesel is produced from sunflowers, and bioethanol is produced by fermenting other crops that contain sugar or starch. South Africa excludes maize as a feedstock for bioethanol production because it is a food, but there is no feedstock excluded for biodiesel production because all its feedstocks are both fuel and food. Bioenergy investment can bring opportunities that will (i) drive rural development, and (ii) increase the harvest for both food and fuel crops. Across the African continent, farmers are making efforts to diversify into biofuel production: for example, in Botswana, one such new project aimed at producing biodiesel from oil extracted from sunflower seeds has the potential to improve incomes for farmers and create new jobs. As the need for power to fuel the world's economy grows, biofuels are increasingly being seen as an opportunity for African farmers. Therefore, sunflower production plays an important role in the tight balance of food-fuel security as well as the environment. Thus, sunflower cultivation can be seen as an opportunity to improve the society in developing countries. However, the future is not without problems: the scenario of climate change indicates that African agriculture will be hit hard by droughts and salinization of groundwater aquifers as the sea level rises. Though sunflowers are drought resistant, they are sensitive to salt stress. Considering the link between climate change and development, detailed studies on plant response to salt stress will be required in order to enable continued cultivation of sunflowers.

PY  - 1992
VL  - 64

AB  - This issue of the journal contains 25 papers from a workshop on one of the most intriguing aspects of the carbon cycle -- that of natural carbon sinks. A key finding of the workshop was the unanimous decision to discard the steady-state assumption and explore the implications of such a departure for the understanding of the global carbon budget. During the workshop, numerous potential carbon sinks that to date had not been considered in the modeling of the carbon cycle were identified. These included the coastal zone, biomass-accreting mature forests, soils, and other sectors of the biota such as arid lands. In a sense, this workshop's conclusion closes the historical loop in the analysis of the carbon cycle by validating Clarke's (1908) initial assumption that the biota was the sink for the excess CO2 produced by the burning of organic fuels. A second key finding of the workshop was that substantial potential exists for capturing and sequestering carbon in natural systems. It is economically feasible to manage existing and additional terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to substantially increase the level of carbon sequestration. The prospect of managing natural systems to absorb additional carbon should begin to change the mind-set under which scientists, policy makers and society deal with the issue of further greenhouse gas increases.

TI  - The response of nematodes to deep-sea CO2 sequestration: A quantile regression approach
JO  - Deep-sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers
PY  - 2010
VL  - 57
IS  - 5
AB  - One proposed approach to ameliorate the effects of global warming is sequestration of the greenhouse gas CO2 in the deep sea. To evaluate the environmental impact of this approach, we exposed the sediment-dwelling fauna at the mouth of the Monterey Submarine Canyon (3262 m) and a site on the nearby continental rise (3607 m) to CO2-rich water. We measured meiobenthic nematode population and community metrics after âˆ¼30-day exposures along a distance gradient from the CO2 source and with sediment depth to infer the patterns of mortality. We also compared the nematode response with that of harpacticoid copepods. Nematode abundance, average sediment depth, tail-group composition, and length: width ratio did not vary with distance from the CO2 source. However, quantile regression showed that nematode length and diameter increased in close proximity to the CO2 source in both experiments. Further, the effects of CO2 exposure and sediment depth (nematodes became more slender at one site, but larger at the other, with increasing depth in the sediment) varied with body size. For example, the response of the longest nematodes differed from those of average length. We propose that nematode body length and diameter increases were induced by lethal exposure to CO2-rich water and that nematodes experienced a high rate of mortality in both experiments. In contrast, copepods experienced high mortality rates in only one experiment suggesting that CO2 sequestration effects are taxon specific. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

JO  - International Journal Of Hydrogen Energy
PY  - 2017
VL  - 42
IS  - 1
AB  - Hybrid fuel cell propulsion systems for marine applications are attracting widespread interest due to the need to reduce ship emissions. In order to increase the potential of these systems, the design of an efficient energy management strategy (EMS) is essential to distribute the required power properly between different components of the hybrid system. For a hybrid fuel cell/battery passenger ship, a multi-scheme energy managements strategy is proposed. This strategy is developed using four schemes which are: state-based EMS, equivalent fuel consumption minimization strategy (ECMS), charge-depleting charge-sustaining (CDCS) EMS, the classical proportional-integral (PI) controller based EMS, in addition to a code that chooses the suitable scheme according to the simulation inputs. The main objective of the proposed multi-scheme EMS is to minimize the total consumed energy of the hybrid system in order to increase the energy efficiency of the ship. The world's first fuel cell passenger ship FCS Alsterwasser is considered and its hybrid propulsion system is modelled in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The performance of the developed multi-scheme EMS is compared to the four studied strategies in terms of total consumed energy, hydrogen consumption, total cost and the stresses seen by the hybrid fuel cell/battery system components considering a daily ship operation of 8Â h. Results indicate that a maximum energy and hydrogen consumption savings of 8% and 16.7% respectively can be achieved using the proposed multi-scheme strategy. Â© 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - This paper looks at Multi-Terminal Voltage Source Converter High Voltage Direct Current (MT-VSC-HVDC) technology as a means of distributing renewable electricity generation, whilst providing a dependable, secure, resilient transmission network with redundancy and quality. VSC-HVDC has already proven itself for transmission links over 900km and more are being built. For MT-VSC-HVDC technology to be viable and proven within the offshore industry, it would have to face up to the already proven HVAC and VSC-HVDC links used today, like Germany's BorWin1 wind farm venture. Many papers have studied VSC-HVDC technology over HVAC in terms of its engineering and economics, but very little has been done in the way of MT-VSC-HVDC. This new transmission medium shall be reviewed in terms of its economics, viability and operational costs through a simplified model. This paper was instigated by another research being conducted on fault analysis within a meshed VSC-HVDC network. Evidence in this paper will ascertain the importance of MT-VSC-HVDC networks within the future of renewable energy networking, when compared with point-to-point HVDC/HVAC networks and when covering larger seas.

AB  - Blades of tidal stream turbines have to sustain many different loads during operation in the underwater environment, so securing their structural safety is a key issue. In this study, we focused on periodic loads due to wave orbital motion and propose a load reduction method with a blade design. The flap of an airplane wing is a well-known structure designed to increase lift, and it can also change the load distribution on the wing through deflection. For this reason, we adopted a passive flap structure for the load reduction and investigated its effectiveness by an analytical method based on the blade element moment theory. Flap torsional stiffness required for the design of the passive flap can be obtained by calculating the flap moment based on the analytic method. Comparison between a flapped and a fixed blade showed the effect of the flap on load reduction in a high amplitude wave condition. Â© 2020, Korea Ocean Research and Development Institute.

AB  - Decarbonization of marine transport is a key global issue, with the carbon emissions of international shipping projected to increase 23\% to 1090 million tonnes by 2035 in comparison to 2015 levels. Optimization of the energy system (especially propulsion system) in these vessels is a complex multi-objective challenge involving economical maintenance, environmental metrics, and energy demand requirements. In this paper, data from instrumented vessels on the River Thames in London, which includes environmental emissions, power demands, journey patterns, and variance in operational patterns from the captain(s) and loading (passenger numbers), is integrated and analyzed through automatic, multi-objective global optimization to create an optimal hybrid propulsion configuration for a hybrid vessel. We propose and analyze a number of computational techniques, both for monitoring and remaining useful lifetime (RUL) estimation of individual energy assets, as well as modeling and optimization of energy use scenarios of a hybrid-powered vessel. Our multi-objective optimization relates to emissions, asset health, and power performance. We show that, irrespective of the battery packs used, our Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) algorithm is able to achieve over 92\% accuracy in remaining useful life (RUL) predictions. A k-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN) is proposed for prognostics of state of charge (SOC) of back-up lead-acid batteries. The classifier achieved an average of 95.5\% accuracy in a three-fold cross validation. Utilizing operational data from the vessel, optimal autonomous propulsion strategies are modeled combining the use of battery and diesel engines. The experiment results show that 70\% to 80\% of fuel saving can be achieved when the diesel engine is operated up to 350 kW. Our methodology has demonstrated the feasibility of combination of artificial intelligence (AI) methods and real world data in decarbonization and optimization of green technologies for maritime propulsion.

Despite this great potential, there are no commercial offshore wind farms in operation in the US, and, in the EU, offshore wind accounts for < 2% of all generation. A discussion on the case for offshore wind projects covers regulatory, technological, and economic challenges; absence of a comprehensive permitting regime for offshore projects; the Energy Policy Act of 2005 - the first federal legislation to address offshore wind; demonstration projects, power purchase contracts, purchasing regimes, and state and local permitting; tough turbine technology; and costs of offshore wind farms.

AB  - Enhanced species richness can stimulate the productivity of plant communities; however, its effect on the belowground production of forests has scarcely been tested, despite the role of tree roots in carbon storage and ecosystem processes. Therefore, we tested for the effects of tree species richness on mangrove root biomass: thirty-two 6 m by 6 m plots were planted with zero (control), one, two or three species treatments of six-month-old Avicennia marina (A), Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (B) and Ceriops tagal (C). A monoculture of each species and the four possible combinations of the three species were used, with four replicate plots per treatment. Above- and belowground biomass was measured after three and four years' growth. In both years, the all-species mix (ABC) had significant overyielding of roots, suggesting complementarity mediated by differences in rhizosphere use amongst species. In year four, there was higher belowground than aboveground biomass in all but one treatment. Belowground biomass was strongly influenced by the presence of the most vigorously growing species, A. marina. These results demonstrate the potential for complementarity between fast- and slow-growing species to enhance belowground growth in mangrove forests, with implications for forest productivity and the potential for belowground carbon sequestration.

JO  - Acta Geotechnica
PY  - 2021
VL  - 16
IS  - 5
AB  - Calcareous sand, a special type of sand commonly used for the construction of coastal engineering in tropical coasts, is usually required to be strengthened due to its poor engineering mechanical properties. Microbially induced carbonate precipitation has been proved to be a promising method for this purpose. A higher cementation level generally leads to a greater strength enhancement, but tends to cause brittle failure of bio-cemented calcareous sand, which in turn brings great potential risks for the coastal engineering. Therefore, the shear behaviour, especially the brittle behaviour, of bio-cemented calcareous sand needs to be understood properly, and taking some measures to improve its brittle behaviour is also necessary. In this regard, a series of triaxial compression tests were conducted to study the shear behaviour of bio-cemented calcareous sand with various cementation levels, and the waste rubber particles are used to improve the brittle behaviour of bio-cemented calcareous sand. The test results show that the shear strength of bio-cemented calcareous sand increases with the increase in cementation level, and the brittle behaviour is significant gradually. The waste rubber particles contribute to improve the brittle behaviour of bio-cemented calcareous sand, reducing the dilation of bio-cemented calcareous sand and slowing the changes in dilatancy with the increment of stress.

AB  - The use of end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring to confirm the correct placement of a tracheal tube immediately after intubation is mandatory in the operating theatre. Tracheal intubation in critically ill patients can be challenging. Quick and accurate confirmation of tracheal tube placement is essential to minimise complications. This survey explored the use of end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring to confirm tracheal tube placement in intensive care units in the UK. Questionnaires were sent to either the lead clinician or clinical director of randomly selected general adult intensive care units. One hundred and twenty-seven replies were received from the 215 questionnaires sent (response rate 59\%). Twenty per cent of the units did not have an end-tidal carbon dioxide monitor, 20\% had one end-tidal carbon dioxide monitor per bed and 60\% had one end-tidal carbon dioxide monitor between several beds. Only 50\% of the units having an end-tidal carbon dioxide monitor use it to confirm correct tracheal tube placement. Of these 50\%, only about a third use it for every intubation. Seventy-two per cent of respondents felt that end-tidal carbon dioxide is well suited to confirm correct placement of tracheal tube in critically ill patients, but 50\% did not think that confirmation using end-tidal carbon dioxide should be mandatory for intubations outside the operating theatre. Half of the units not having end-tidal a carbon dioxide monitor cited lack of resources as a reason. In summary, although four in every five intensive care units surveyed have end-tidal carbon dioxide monitors, only a small proportion use them to confirm correct placement of tracheal tube after intubation.

AB  - The Northern Sea Route (NSR) has recently become an alternative route for seaborne transportation between Europe and Asia due to the decreasing ice conditions. The reduced sailing distance can provide great savings in time used and fuel consumption. However, there are environmental concerns regarding increased emissions in Arctic areas. Emission regulations in MARPOL's Annex VI sets limits for emission of sulphur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in special areas. The Arctic areas are potentially a candidate for a such status. There are several alternative technologies under development to comply with the new regulations, including exhaust gas cleaning systems, cleaner fuel and cleaner engines. However, the costs of complying are significant, and payback on investments depends on the overall operational profile. This paper addresses the decision of using either the NSR or the SCR between Europe and Asia, given a new Emission Control Area (ECA) in the Arctic Seas. The study quantifies the effects of introducing ECA regulations in these areas, and compares the costs of sailing the NSR to the costs of sailing the conventional route via the Suez Canal. The study considers one case ship and three different scenarios with different technology installed in order to comply with emission regulations. The results from the scenario simulations show significant reductions in fuel consumption and emission reductions for the NSR. However, with the present fuel cost and emission legislation, the NSR with an Arctic ECA will not be cost efficient compared to the SCR. Â© 2015 by ASME.

AB  - Ships have an indispensable role in trading and transportation. Due to the growth of population and the new demands of the growing economies, the need for shipping but also its harmful effects are increasing and emission problems will grow further in the future. The main harmful effects caused by shipping are carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), oxides of sulfur (SOx), particulate matter (PM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and black carbon (BC). The emissions have global effects on the health of a large number of people, especially those living in cities with a harbour. Although emissions caused by shipping are comparatively small, they must be in focus. With the increasing importance of global warming and social awareness, ship manufacturing industry should behave in parallel with the new rules. International organizations, such as International Maritime Organization (IMO), and several governments brought strict rules to reduce the emissions to an acceptable level. Besides, innovative and effective technologies are developed by some companies under the support of international organizations and national authorities. In this study, we aimed to investigate the current regulations and emission reduction technologies. Annual emission footprint estimation is calculated in order to remark the potential danger of shipping emissions. Two methodologies are used for calculations, namely, fuel consumption approach and engine power approach. Emission factors are taken from three different studies. In fuel consumption approach, the total emission amounts were 10115.7 and 9213.7 tons (according to Cooper and Gustafsson {[}35] as well as Eyring et al. {[}18] emission factors). For engine power approach, three different results are reached: 11503.1, 11191.2 and 11546.4 tons of Cooper and Gustafsson {[}35], Eyring et al. [}18] and CALEPA {[}36] emission factors.

AB  - Improving ship system efficiency is a growing concern for the marine industry. New regulations imposed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) have set efficiency targets for new and existing ships. These targets are outlined in the energy efficiency design index (EEDI) and will reach a maximum of 30% by 2025. In order to satisfy the regulations, ship owners are exploring new methods to improve the efficiency of existing systems. One such method is to capture and repurpose engine waste heat. Many ships employ exhaust steam boilers to recover heat from engine exhaust. This represents a source of high quality heat (â‰¥ 200Â°C). At these temperatures, it is relatively easy to extract thermal energy. In contrast, low quality heat sources, such as engine jacket water (â‰¤ 100Â°C), have been largely ignored. Steam production is impractical at such low temperatures. A new technology was needed to take advantage of low temperature heat sources on the ship. Calnetix Technologies, in conjunction with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), developed an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) specifically designed to utilize engine jacket water as a heat source. The first prototype was successfully built, tested, and certified by Lloyd's Registry (LR) and Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (NK) in March 2015. The system generates up to 125 kW from a heat source with temperature range 80Â°C to 95Â°C. This prototype was installed, commissioned, and placed into service on the Arnold Maersk container ship in April 2016. This paper will discuss difficulties which arose during the installation. It will also present and discuss data collected by the ORC's sensors during its first several months of operation. Finally benefits of the ORC operation in conjunction with auxiliary ship systems will be explained. Â© 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - An important ecosystem service of tropical coastal vegetation including seagrass beds and mangrove forests is their ability to accumulate carbon. Here we attempt to establish the driving forces for the accumulation of surface organic carbon in Southern Thailand coastal systems. Across 12 sites we found that in line with expectations, seagrass beds (0.6 +/- 0.09\%) and mangrove forests (0.9 +/- 0.3\%) had higher organic carbon in the surface (top 5 cm) sediment than un-vegetated mudflats (0.4 +/- 0.04\%). Unexpectedly, however, mangrove forests in this region retained organic carbon, rather than outwell it, under normal tidal conditions. No relationship was found between organic carbon and substrate grain size. The most interesting finding of our study was that climax and pioneer seagrass species retained more carbon than mixed-species meadows, suggesting that plant morphology and meadow characteristics can be important factors in organic carbon accumulation. Insights such as these are important in developing carbon management strategies involving coastal ecosystems such as offsetting of carbon emissions. The ability of tropical coastal vegetation to sequester carbon is an important aspect for valuing the ecosystems. Our results provide some initial insight into the factors affecting carbon sequestration in these ecosystems, but also highlight the need for further research on a global scale.

AB  - Dredging is a regular maintenance for navigation in harbours and water channels; however, disposal of dredged sediment poses environmental liability and leads to shortfall of disposal facilities. This study demonstrated an innovative approach to transform contaminated sediment into eco-friendly sediment blocks, by applying binary cement and CO2 curing. The binary use of magnesium oxide cement (MOC) and ordinary Portland cement (OPC) with air curing improved the compatibility of heavy metals and cement by provision of sufficient magnesium hydrates for metal sequestration. However, an introduction of MOC weakened compressive strength and increased water absorption of sediment blocks. Therefore, 1-d CO2 curing was employed to transform soluble magnesium hydrate into stable carbonates, and densify the microstructure and reduce the porosity from 18.5\% to 16.9\%, which enabled a substantial enhancement in strength (2.8 times) as well as carbon sequestration (3.98 wt\%) in 40\% MOC sample. A subsequent 7-d air curing with moisturizing facilitated continuous carbonation and rehydration of binary cement, resulting in a deeper carbonation and higher strength by the provision of additional nucleation sites of reactive magnesium oxide. Although accelerated carbonation had an adverse influence on metal immobilization in OPC sample due to pH decrease, it provided synergistic interaction with binary cement samples due to sufficient hydrates and pH buffering capacity. Therefore, binary cement with CO2 curing presents a novel and green stabilization/solidification technology for recycling contaminated sediment as valuable and eco-friendly construction materials.

AB  - Integrating oscillating water columns (OWCs) into a row of closely-spaced hollow piles can form a wave farm, leading to cost reductions through cost-sharing with other structures and thus making the wave energy conversion more economically viable. It is important to understand the effects of the distance between the OWCs in the row on the performance of the wave farm. Using an air-water two-phase flow model, validated by a set of wave-flume test results, the hydrodynamic performance of the wave farm was investigated, with a focus on effects of the distance between OWCs on capture efficiency as well as wave transmission and reflection. The power takeoff (PTO) was represented by an orifice whose effects were parameterized by a porous media in the simulation. Sidewall effects that may be encountered in wave flume tests were also discussed.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Detailed wave energy resource assessments are necessary for the planning and design of wave energy converters. The waves in the U.S. Pacific Northwest have been identified as very energetic making this coast potentially suitable for wave energy harvesting. Several efforts to harvest this resource are under way in this region, however no long term, high resolution description of the resource is presently available. Here, the results of a 7 year hindcast are presented at a 30 arc-second resolution using the numerical models WAVEWATCH III and SWAN. The hindcast accuracy was quantified by comparing to measured buoy data yielding linear correlation coefficients similar to 0.90 for the significant wave height. This study describes the alongshore variability of the resource over the continental shelf. The general decline of the wave power with depth is explained by considerations of wave refraction and shoaling. Further, due to wave refraction, areas off the central and southwest Oregon coast are identified that show increased wave power at 50 m of water in comparison with the 250 m value. These areas also show increased temporal variability. In addition, areas with preferentially narrower wave spectra in both frequency and direction are identified off southwest Oregon. Further, general trends in the directionality of the resource indicate a systematic switch in the wave direction with latitude. The seasonality of the resource is also assessed in terms of variability and trends relevant to the planning and deployment of wave energy converters. The continental shelf is mapped in terms of the coefficient of variability, which is greater (smaller) than unity during the summer (winter) and regardless of the season smaller in southwest Oregon.

AB  - An artificial mound was settled in the shallow ocean to enhance vertical mixing of nutrients and consequent primary production. It is expected that this technology contributes to the biological fixation of CO2 in the ocean. The turbulent mixing generated by the interaction between tidal currents and the mound was numerically simulated by using large eddy simulation in the cases of spring and half tides. The energy dissipation rate calculated from the numerical simulation shows a large horizontal variation when the tidal speed is large and a clear enhancement by the mound can be seen. The comparison between numerical result and the measurement implies that the location of the measurement was not included in the region of large energy dissipation. The vertical diffusivity was estimated from the numerical result to roughly quantify the vertical diffusive velocity of nutrients, which was enhanced up to 10âˆ’6â€“10âˆ’5Â mÂ sâˆ’1 when the tidal speed is its maximum, while it was 10âˆ’7Â mÂ sâˆ’1 when the effect of the mound is little.

AB  - Microbial plankton respiration is the key determinant in the balance between the storage of organic carbon in the oceans or its conversion to carbon dioxide with accompanying consumption of dissolved oxygen. Over the past 50 years, dissolved oxygen concentrations have decreased in many parts of the world's oceans, and this trend of ocean deoxygenation is predicted to continue. Yet despite its pivotal role in ocean deoxygenation, microbial respiration remains one of the least constrained microbial metabolic processes. Improved understanding of the magnitude and variability of respiration, including attribution to component plankton groups, and quantification of the respiratory quotient, would enable better predictions, and projections of the intensity and extent of ocean deoxygenation and of the integrative impact of ocean deoxygenation, ocean acidification, warming, and changes in nutrient concentration and stoichiometry on marine carbon storage. This study will synthesize current knowledge of respiration in relation to deoxygenation, including the drivers of its variability, identify key unknowns in our ability to project future scenarios and suggest an approach to move the field forward.

AB  - Most Wave Energy Converters (WECs) produce highly distorted power due to the reciprocal motion induced by ocean waves. Some WEC systems have integrated energy storage that overcomes this limitation, but add significant expenses to an already costly system. As an alternative approach, this article investigates the direct export option that relies on aggregate smoothing among several WECs. By optimizing the positioning of the WEC devices with respect to the incoming waves, fluctuations may be mutually canceled out between the devices. This work is based on Fred. Olsen's WEC system Lifesaver, and a WEC farm consisting of 48 devices is designed in detail and simulated. The major cost driver for the electrical export system is the required oversize factor necessary for transfer of the average power output. Due to the low power quality, this number can be as high as 20 at the entry point of the electrical system, and it is thus crucial to quickly improve the power quality so that the downstream power system is efficiently utilized. The simulations undertaken in this work indicate that a high quality power output can be achieved at the farm level, but that a significant oversize factor will be required in the intermediate power system within the farm.

AB  - We discuss the use of the environmental contour method to derive design loads for an active stall-regulated offshore wind turbine. Two different Danish offshore environments, Redsand and Horns Rev, are considered for the locations of the turbine. The accuracy of the derived design loads is assessed by comparing them with exact solutions derived using full integration over an accurate description of the failure domain. The error in estimating design loads is introduced because 2 key assumptions of the method are violated: first, the limit state surface, especially in the operating range of the turbine, is not well-approximated by a tangent hyperplane at the design point; and second, failure in any of the possible turbine states (e.g., operating or parked states are discussed here) needs to be considered in computing accurate failure probabilities. It is recommended that environmental contours and iso-response curves be plotted and interpreted before establishing design load levels.

AB  - Planktic diatoms are the largest primary producers in marine and freshwater habitats. Their dry biomass accumulates up to 50\% of lipids and contains water-soluble beta-1,3-glucans as major storage products. Because of the world-wide abundance of these photosynthetic protists, beta-1,3-glucans may rival cellulose as the polysaccharide with the highest annual production on Earth. Here we show the feasibility of a simple and efficient process leading to bio-hydrogen by dark fermentation of microalgal biomass with the thermophilic bacterium Thermotoga neapolitana. Production of the biogas on minimum medium supplemented only with the extract of the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii proved that algal biomass per se can serve as substrate for sustaining the biotechnological process with no requirement of any pretreatment and external integration of other nutrients. At the same time, lipids unused for the anaerobic production of the biogas, can be employed for production of bio-diesel, thus considerably increasing the economic potential of these renewable feedstocks.

VL  - 8

AB  - The partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) in the sea and the air-sea CO2 flux in plume waters are subject to interactions among biological production, horizontal advection, and upwelling under wind events. In this study, time series of pCO(2) and other biogeochemical parameters in the dynamic Changjiang plume were presented to illuminate the controlling factors of pCO(2) and the air-sea CO2 flux after a strong south wind event (July 23-24, maximum of 11.2 ms(-1)). The surface pCO(2) decreased by 310 mu atm (to 184 mu atm) from July 24 to 26. Low-pCO(2) waters (<200 mu atm) were observed in the following 2 days. Corresponding chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen (DO) increase, and a significant relationship between DO and npCO(2) indicated that biological uptake drove the pCO(2) decrease. The salinity of undersaturated-CO2 waters decreased by 3.57 (from 25.03 to 21.46) within 2 days (July 27-28), suggesting the offshore advection of plume waters in which CO2 had been biologically reduced. Four days after the wind event, the upwelling of high-CO2 waters was observed, which increased the pCO(2) by 428 mu atm (up to 584 mu atm) within 6 days. Eight days after the onset of upwelling, the surface pCO(2) started to decrease (from 661 to 346 mu atm within 3 days), which was probably associated with biological production. Regarding the air-sea CO2 flux, the carbon sink of the plume was enhanced as the low-pCO(2) plume waters were pushed offshore under the south winds. In its initial stage, the subsequent upwelling made the surface waters act as a carbon source to the atmosphere. However, the surface waters became a carbon sink again after a week of upwelling. Such short-term air-sea carbon fluxes driven by wind have likely occurred in other dynamic coastal waters and have probably induced significant uncertainties in flux estimations.</p>

AB  - Due to the environmental damage caused by pollutants generated from ships, air pollution regulations are increasingly being strengthened and new technologies are being developed for the use of various eco-friendly fuels. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is an attractive eco-friendly fuel that can bridge the transition to commercialized zero-carbon ships. LPG, as an alternative marine propulsion fuel, has advantageous characteristics and market competitiveness, particularly for fishing vessels as well as small and medium-sized domestic vessels. This study quantitatively analyzed the annual fuel consumption costs and reduction in the air pollutants by using LPG fuel in South Korean registered ships that had a high feasibility for conversion to LPG fuel. For all the ships, the annual fuel consumption was reduced by 7.5â€“10.4% and the fuel cost by 8.8â€“25.9%. Furthermore, compared to conventional fuels, the most harmful pollutants such as SOx, PM10, and PM2.5 could be removed after converting to LPG fuel, and CO2 emissions could be reduced by 10â€“14%. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the use of LPG through government policies and price subsidies, particularly for fishing vessels with a high feasibility for conversion to LPG. These efforts should be based on the effectiveness and competitiveness of LPG, which is widely applicable regardless of ship size and can reduce air pollutants like when using liquefied natural gas fuel.

These seawater samples were sampled from the East China Sea located Shanghai and Zhejiang province in China. The stack gas desulfurization of coal-fired power plant by seawater was conducted on 100 m(3)/h scale at Zhejiang. A pilot plant with 6000 m3/h scale has been completed and put into operation in Shanghai. It is found that the removal efficiency of SO2 increase with ratio of seawater with stack gas. The removal rate of SO2 in stack gas reached about 90-95\% when a plate tower was used. The waste seawater absorbed SO2 can return to the sea after aeration and neutralization.

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - To meet the reduction targets of greenhouse gas emissions by highly polluting vessels such as cruise ships, several strategies are possible: the introduction of new fuels (i.e. LNG, hydrogen and biofuel), the installation of more efficient engines, the electrification of the propulsion systems, the lightening of the structures, the energy efficiency improvement of the auxiliary services (i.e. air conditioning). In particular, vessels weight reduction can be achieved by introducing new materials. The aim of this work was to manufacture an innovative laminate, which comes from the combination of a cork layer and an aluminium honeycomb sandwich, intended to provide an eco-friendly and lightweight solution for structures potentially destined to marine applications, such as ship decks, hulls or cabinsâ€™ construction. The suggested solution is expected to combine several functions and properties, such as low density and thermal and acoustic insulation - which potentially influence propulsion and auxiliaries fuel consumptionâ€”as well as good mechanical performances. The investigation was particularly focused on the potentialities offered by the cork layer, traditionally addressed at insulation purposes, in supporting and enhancing the impact-absorption capabilities of the aluminium honeycomb structure, especially in view of the potential marine applications which often suffer from low-velocity impact events. Having a dual function: (i) to lighten the superstructures and (ii) to promote the thermal and acoustic insulation, by thus influencing, respectively, propulsion and auxiliaries fuel consumption. For instance, the suggested solution could be used for cabinsâ€™ construction. In the present work, the energy absorption capabilities of the new lightweight structure were evaluated by means of low-velocity impact tests. An excellent response, comparable to that of double-layer aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels, was observed, suggesting that the new structure is a promising and sustainable alternative for marine constructions.

AB  - Seagrasses are among the planet's most effective natural ecosystems for sequestering (capturing and storing) carbon (C); but if degraded, they could leak stored C into the atmosphere and accelerate global warming. Quantifying and modelling the C sequestration capacity is therefore critical for successfully managing seagrass ecosystems to maintain their substantial abatement potential. At present, there is no mechanism to support carbon financing linked to seagrass. For seagrasses to be recognised by the IPCC and the voluntary C market, standard stock assessment methodologies and inventories of seagrass C stocks are required. Developing accurate C budgets for seagrass meadows is indeed complex; we discuss these complexities, and, in addition, we review techniques and methodologies that will aid development of C budgets. We also consider a simple process-based data assimilation model for predicting how seagrasses will respond to future change, accompanied by a practical list of research priorities.

AB  - Mangroves are recognized as one of the richest carbon storage systems. However, the factors regulating carbon sinks in mangrove ecosystems are still unclear, particularly in the subtropical mangroves. The biomass, production, litterfall, detrital export and decomposition of the dominant mangrove vegetation in subtropical (Kandelia obovata) and tropical (Avicennia marina) Taiwan were quantified from October 2011 to July 2014 to construct the carbon budgets. Despite the different tree species, a principal component analysis revealed the site or environmental conditions had a greater influence than the tree species on the carbon processes. For both species, the net production (NP) rates ranged from 10.86 to 27.64Â MgÂ CÂ haâˆ’1Â yearâˆ’1 and were higher than the global average rate due to the high tree density. While most of the litterfall remained on the ground, a high percentage (72%â€“91%) of the ground litter decomposed within 1Â year and fluxed out of the mangroves. However, human activities might cause a carbon flux into the mangroves and a lower NP rate. The rates of the organic carbon export and soil heterotrophic respiration were greater than the global mean values and those at other locations. Only a small percentage (3%â€“12%) of the NP was stored in the sediment. The carbon burial rates were much lower than the global average rate due to their faster decomposition, indicating that decomposition played a critical role in determining the burial rate in the sediment. The summation of the organic and inorganic carbon fluxes and soil heterotrophic respiration well exceeded the amount of litter decomposition, indicating an additional source of organic carbon that was unaccounted for by decomposition in the sediment. Sediment-stable isotope analyses further suggest that the trapping of organic matter from upstream rivers or adjacent waters contributed more to the mangrove carbon sinks than the actual production of the mangrove trees.

AB  - Coastal sediments contain a large amount of dissolved organic matter (DOM), which can be mobilized into the overlying water by natural and anthropogenic activities. The bioavailability and subsequent biogeochemical effects of this sediment-derived DOM are unclear. To investigate those, we collected a sediment pore-water DOM (SDOM) sample and its overlying seawater to conduct a bioassay experiment, which allowed tracking of both short-term and long-term microbial processes in the context of DOM transformations. Short-term incubation results show that the SDOM extract supported the growth of specific taxa. The microbial community composition changed dramatically and an approximately 50\% of SDOM-derived carbon was consumed within the first 2 days. Viruses likely played a role in promoting bacterial community succession, further enhancing transformation of this SDOM. Long-term incubation results show that labile DOM was gradually consumed, while approximately 16\% of the initial SDOM appeared to be recalcitrant to microbial utilization and remained at the end (after 110 days) of the incubation experiment. Despite the short-term drastic changes in microbial community composition, a highly diverse microbial community is similar to the control at the end of the incubation. It is suggested here that resuspension of coastal sediments weakens their role as a net sink of carbon, with most of the mobilized SDOM transformed by successive microbial communities in the overlying seawater and the remaining recalcitrant organic material becoming part of the long-lived DOM pool. Thus, the bioavailability of the coastal SDOM might influence the carbon budget in coastal oceans.

AB  - Carbon-capture and storage is considered to be a potential mitigation option for climate change. However, accidental leaks of CO2 can occur, resulting in changes in ocean chemistry such as acidification and metal mobilization. Laboratory experiments were performed to provide data on the effects of CO2-related acidification on the chemical fractionation of metal(loid)s in marine-contaminated sediments using sequential extraction procedures. The results showed that sediments from Huelva estuary registered concentrations of arsenic, copper, lead, and zinc that surpass the probable biological effect level established by international protocols. Zinc had the greatest proportion in the most mobile fraction of the sediment. Metals in this fraction represent an environmental risk because they are weakly bound to sediment, and therefore more likely to migrate to the water column. Indeed, the concentration of this metal was lower in the most acidified scenarios when compared to control pH, indicating probable zinc mobilization from the sediment to the seawater.
