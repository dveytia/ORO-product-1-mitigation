JO  - Catena

IS  - NA
AB  - The fast growing exotic Sonneratia apetala has been widely used to increase the mangrove area in China. Despite of the rapidly accumulated biomass, S. apetala does not increase the soil organic carbon (SOC) storage comparing with native mangroves. The belowground biomass of mangrove, especially its fine roots, plays an important role in SOC sequestration. Here, the soil physicochemical properties, vegetation and fine-root biomass and SOC stock were compared between S. apetala (22-year-old) plantation and native mangrove at different stages (20, 40, and 80-year-old) The 22-year-old S. apetala already had a higher vegetation biomass and fine root biomass than the 20-year-old and 40-year-old native mangrove. However, no significant differences in the SOC stock were observed between S. apetala and native mangrove (20-year-old and 40-year-old). The biomass of vegetation and fine root and SOC stock of S. apetala were all significantly lower than that of 80-year-old Rhizophora stylosa. Multiple stepwise regression analysis suggested that lower C:N ratio of fine roots and soil salinity in S. apetala can promote the decomposition rate of fine roots and then offset the carbon accumulation advantage related to higher fine root biomass. Restoration of mangrove was effective to enhance soil carbon stock, but the exotic S. apetala should be decreased or avoided in the future, especially in the Natural Reserve.

TI  - The intra-annual variability in the performance of wave energy converters: A comparative study in N Galicia (Spain)

PY  - 2015
VL  - 82
IS  - NA
AB  - This paper presents the analysis of the intra-annual power performance of different WECs (wave energy converters) at two locations of interest in the northern coastal region of Galicia (NW Spain). With this aim, the wave resource at the locations of interest is characterised by considering a procedure whose implementation on a coastal region produces the required wave spectral information for reconstructing the coastal resource in terms of monthly characterisation matrices with the adequate resolution for conducting accurate performance computations of WECs. Next, the monthly performance of different WECs at these locations is estimated through the combination of the characterisation matrices obtained and the efficiency of the technologies analysed. The results show that the analysis of the intra-annual performance of different technologies at different locations is a key aspect so as to define the most appropriate WEC-site combination for harnessing the wave energy resource in a coastal region. Finally, the information produced by implementing the methodology considered in this work allows the reconstruction of the wave resource at any coastal site (not only at the selected locations), in the form of monthly high resolution characterisation matrices, and thus, the monthly performance of any WEC-site combination can be computed.

AB  - The growing requirements for limiting the negative impact of all modes of transport on the natural environment mean that clean technologies are becoming more and more important. The global trend of e-mobility also applies to sea and inland water transport. This article presents the results of experimental tests carried out on a life-size, parallel diesel-electric hybrid propulsion system. The efficiency of the propulsion system was analysed for two modes of operation (electric and diesel) and for different engine speeds and loads. Analysis of the impact of using a hybrid propulsion system on fuel consumption was carried out on a case study vessel and for six actual journeys. The use of hybrid propulsion in zero emission mode enables up to four times higher energy efficiency when compared to a conventional drive, while reducing CO2 emissions and air pollution to zero, as well as a hundred-fold reduction in noise emissions. High flexibility in the operation of such a drive enables the use of intelligent power control technology (smart propulsion). This article shows that the use of hybrid propulsion reduces the negative impact on the environment to a minimum and allows for a significant reduction in the vessel's operating costs.

TI  - INTEGRATED SYSTEM DESIGN AND CONTROL OPTIMIZATION OF HYBRID ELECTRIC PROPULSION SYSTEM USING A BI-LEVEL, NESTED APPROACH
JO  - NANA
PY  - 2020
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Hybrid electric powertrain systems present as effective alternatives to traditional vehicle and marine propulsion means with improved fuel efficiency, as well as reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air pollutants. In this study, a new integrated, model-based design and optimization method for hybrid electric propulsion system of a marine vessel (harbor tugboat) has been introduced. The sizes of key hybrid powertrain components, especially the Li-ion battery energy storage system (ESS), which can greatly affect the ship's life-cycle cost (LCC), have been optimized using the fuel efficiency, emission and lifecycle cost model of the hybrid powertrain system. Moreover, the control strategies for the hybrid system, which is essential for achieving the minimum fuel consumption and extending battery life, are optimized. For a given powertrain architecture, the optimal design of a hybrid marine propulsion system involves two critical aspects: the optimal sizing of key powertrain components, and the optimal power control and energy management. In this work, a bi-level, nested optimization framework was proposed to address these two intricate problems jointly. The upper level optimization aims at component size optimization, while the lower level optimization carries out optimal operation control through dynamic programming (DP) to achieve the globally minimum fuel consumption and battery degradation for a given vessel load profile. The optimized Latin hypercube sampling (OLHS), Kriging and the widely used Expected Improvement (EI) online sampling criterion are used to carry out ``small data{''} driven global optimization to solve this nested optimization problem. The obtained results showed significant reduction of the vessel LCC with the optimized hybrid electric powertrain system design and controls. Reduced engine size and operation time, as well as improved operation efficiency of the hybrid system also greatly decreased the GHG emissions compared to traditional mechanical propulsion.

AB  - Exploiting solar power for hydrogen production from seawater is a great challenge owing to the corrosive properties of seawater and inadequate visible-light conversion capabilities. Here we report an uncomplicated post-processing method to construct Ti3+ self-doped titanium-silicon material with corrosion resistance. This is a new experimental method to regulate the electrical, optical, and photocatalytic performances of titanium-containing photocatalysts in a controlled way. Moreover, we demonstrate that Ti-O-Si materials with different calcination temperatures can serve as a highly efficient and convenient catalyst for photogeneration of hydrogen from water and simulated seawater. Consequently, the optimized Ti-O-Si (400) sample exhibits impressive enhancement in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance, by nearly 10.0 and 43.1 times compared with TiO2 nanoparticles in water and simulated seawater. The Ti-O-Si (400) with substantial Ti3+ and oxygen vacancies exhibits an excellent photocatalytic H2 production performance due to the improved separation and transmission of the photogenerated electron-hole, the extended visible light response, and corrosion resistance. Our work opens a new door to engineering the intrinsic properties of the titanium-containing materials. Â© 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

TI  - The value of carbon sequestration and storage in coastal habitats
JO  - Estuarine Coastal And Shelf Science
PY  - 2014
VL  - 137
IS  - NA
AB  - Coastal margin habitats are globally significant in terms of their capacity to sequester and store carbon, but their continuing decline, due to environmental change and human land use decisions, is reducing their capacity to provide this ecosystem service. In this paper the UK is used as a case study area to develop methodologies to quantify and value the ecosystem service of blue carbon sequestration and storage in coastal margin habitats. Changes in UK coastal habitat area between 1900 and 2060 are documented, the long term stocks of carbon stored by these habitats are calculated, and the capacity of these habitats to sequester CO2 is detailed. Changes in value of the carbon sequestration service of coastal habitats are then projected for 2000-2060 under two scenarios, the maintenance of the current state of the habitat and the continuation of current trends of habitat loss. If coastal habitats are maintained at their current extent, their sequestration capacity over the period 2000-2060 is valued to be in the region of 1 pound billion UK sterling (3.5\% discount rate). However, if current trends of habitat loss continue, the capacity of the coastal habitats both to sequester and store CO2 will be significantly reduced, with a reduction in value of around 0.25 pound billion UK sterling (2000-2060; 3.5\% discount rate). If loss-trends due to sea level rise or land reclamation worsen, this loss in value will be greater. This case study provides valuable site specific information, but also highlights global issues regarding the quantification and valuation of carbon sequestration and storage. Whilst our ability to value ecosystem services is improving, considerable uncertainty remains. If such ecosystem valuations are to be incorporated with confidence into national and global policy and legislative frameworks, it is necessary to address this uncertainty. Recommendations to achieve this are outlined. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 32
IS  - 8
AB  - Tidal freshwater forested wetlands (TFFW) provide critical ecosystem services including an essential habitat for a variety of wildlife species and significant carbon sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide. However, large uncertainties remain concerning the impacts of climate change on the magnitude and variability of carbon fluxes and storage across a range of TFFW. In this study, we developed a process-driven Tidal Freshwater Wetlands DeNitrification-DeComposition model (TFW-DNDC) that has integrated new features, such as soil salinity effects on plant productivity and soil organic matter decomposition to explore carbon dynamics in the TFFW in response to drought-induced saltwater intrusion. Eight sites along the floodplains of the Waccamaw River (USA) and the Savannah River (USA) were selected to represent the TFFW transition from healthy to moderately and highly salt-impacted forests, and eventually to oligohaline marshes. The TFW-DNDC was calibrated and validated using field observed annual litterfall, stem growth, root growth, soil heterotrophic respiration, and soil organic carbon storage. Analyses indicate that plant productivity and soil carbon sequestration in TFFW could change substantially in response to increased soil pore water salinity and reduced soil water table due to drought, but in interactive ways dependent on the river simulated. These responses are variable due to nonlinear relationships between carbon cycling processes and environmental drivers. Plant productivity, plant respiration, soil organic carbon sequestration rate, and storage in the highly salt-impacted forest sites decreased significantly under drought conditions compared with normal conditions. Considering the high likelihood of healthy and moderately salt-impacted forests becoming highly salt-impacted forests under future climate change and sea-level rise, it is very likely that the TFFW will lose their capacity as carbon sinks without up-slope migration.

TI  - Reducing nitrogen waste from shrimp farming: An integrated approach
JO  - NANA
PY  - 2001
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - One of the key challenges facing the shrimp fanning industry is to develop and apply new practices and technologies that improve the efficiency with which the nitrogen (N) in shrimp feeds is converted to shrimp biomass. It is also critical to ensure that residual N waste is minimized or eliminated prior to discharge into receiving waters. The ability to meet these goals depends on an understanding of the fate and transformations of dietary N in shrimp production ponds and effluent treatment systems. Our studies of intensive Penaeus monodon ponds in Australia have confirmed previous observations that most of the N (90\%) enters the ponds as feed, but only 22\% is retained by the shrimp at harvest. The remainder enters the pond system resulting in high concentrations of ammonium and dissolved organic N (DON), and a high biomass of nanoplankton and bacteria. The high ammonium levels in our study were principally the result of rapid remineralization of detritus on the pond floor, and to a lesser extent, shrimp excretion and water column processes. DON appeared to be produced principally from leaching of shrimp feed and faeces. Ammonium was rapidly cycled through the microbial community whilst most of the DON was refractory. We found that a high proportion of the N added to the ponds was discharged from ponds (57\% over a shrimp growth season). The settlement ponds that we studied had limited effectiveness to reducing N loads in discharge waters (up to 20\%), and this was limited to the particulate N loads. Our studies suggest that settlement ponds alone are unlikely to significantly reduce DON loads; therefore, improvements to feeds and feeding strategies could provide the best means of reducing DON. In this paper we examine the potential to develop and apply new practices and technologies for reducing N waste from shrimp ponds. These include improvements in feed formulations and feed management, genetic selection for improved feed conversion ratios, improved in-pond processing of N, and improved design and management of effluent treatment systems. We. anticipate that all these factors will contribute significantly to the reduction of waste N, particularly if they are incorporated into an integrated waste reduction program. However, we speculate that, for R monodon, improvements in feed management practices coupled with waste-treatment and recirculation are likely to have the greatest short-term impacts. In the longer term, improvements to feed formulations, coupled with the domestication of R monodon and genetic selection for feed conversion efficiency, should result in significant cumulative improvements to the reduction of N waste, and ultimately the sustainability of shrimp fanning.

AB  - Protection of marine environment and reduction of GHG emissions are currently imperative criterion for ship design. For ships in service, including fishing vessels powered by internal combustion engines, options of retrofitting are sought to reduce their hydrodynamic resistance and fuel consumption. One such possibility is the addition of a simple-shape bulbous bow, which can be installed at low cost to upgrade a fishing vessel. We present an analysis of the effect that the bulbous bow has on fishing vessel resistance across the whole range of speeds at which the entire work cycle of the vessel is carried out. The resistance was calculated using a calculation of fluid dynamics (CFD) method for the actual size of the vessel. We show that it is possible to develop such a bulbous bow for which the resistance of fishing vessel with a bulbous bow is going to be lower than that of an unmodified shape. For the modified shape of the fishing vessel, fuel consumption, amount and composition of exhaust gases were calculated and the obtained results were compared with the parameters of the vessel without modification. The tests carried out and the obtained calculation results indicate that a significant reduction of fuel consumption and GHG emissions may be obtained for the existing old fishing vessels at low anticipated modernization costs.

AB  - Ships are an integral part of modern commercial transport, leisure travel, and military system. A diesel engine was used for the first time for the propulsion of a ship sometime in the 1910s and has been the choice for propulsion and power generation, ever since. Since the first model used in ship propulsion, the diesel engine has come a long way with several technological advances. A diesel engine has a particularly high thermal efficiency. Added to it, the higher energy density of the diesel fuel compared to gasoline fuel makes it inherently, the most efficient internal combustion engine. The modern diesel engine also has a very unique ability to work with a variety of fuels like diesel, heavy fuel oil, biodiesel, vegetable oils, and several other crude oil distillates which is very important considering the shortage of petroleum fuels that we face today. In spite of being highly efficient and popular and in spite of all the technological advances, the issue of exhaust gas emissions has plagued a diesel engine. This issue has gained a lot of importance since 1990s when IMO, EU, and the EPA came up with the Tier I exhaust gas emission norms for the existing engine in order to reduce the NOx and SOx. Harsher Tier II and Tier III norms were later announced for newer engines. Diesel fuels commonly used in marine engines are a form of residual fuel, also know as Dregs or Heavy Fuel Oil and are essentially the by products of crude oil distillation process used to produce lighter petroleum fuels like marine distillate fuel and gasoline. They are cheaper than marine distillate fuels but are also high in nitrogen, sulfur and ash content. This greatly increases the NOx and SOx in the exhaust gas emission. Ship owners are trapped between the need to use residual fuels, due to cost of the large volume of fuel consumed, in order to keep the operation of their ships to a competitive level on one hand and on the other hand the need to satisfy the stringent pollution norms as established by the pollution control agencies worldwide. Newer marine diesel engines are being designed to meet the Tier II and Tier III norms wherever applicable but the existing diesel engine owners are still operating their engines with the danger of not meeting the applicable pollution norms worldwide. Here we make an effort to look at some of the measure that the existing marine diesel engine owners can take to reduce emissions and achieve at least levels prescribed in Tier I. Proper maintenance and upkeep of the engine components can be effectively used to reduce the exhaust gas emission. We introduced a pilot program on diesel engine performance monitoring in North America about two years ago and it has yielded quite satisfying results for several shipping companies and more and more ship owners are looking at the option of implementing this program on their ships.

AB  - The new regulations for the prevention of marine pollution are compelling the shipping industry to a change of strategy. This research provides an economical analysis of the short term alternative options for ship owners: to fit exhaust gas cleaning system on board using heavy fuel oil; to burn marine gas oil or to switch from heavy fuel oil to low sulfur fuel entering emissions controlled areas. An economic evaluation model of investments has been developed in order to compare the different solutions. Based on technical data of engines and operative vessel profiles, the model provides possible measurement tools to consider for the investment choice in the defined reference scenario. Different scenarios can be created by modifying investment conditions, environmental regulations and fuel price forecasts. The results of the model application to three real vessels of different types encourage the ship owners to adopt the option of the seawater scrubber. Copyright Â© 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Due to better wind conditions at sea, offshore wind farms have the advantage of higher electricity production compared to onshore and inland wind farms. In contrast, a greater material input, leading to increased energy consumptions and emissions during the production phase, is required to build offshore wind farms. These contrary effects are investigated for the first German offshore wind farm alpha ventus in the North Sea. In a life cycle assessment its environmental influence is compared to that of Germany's electricity mix.In comparison to the mix, alpha ventus had better indicators in nearly every investigated impact category. One kilowatt-hour electricity, generated by the wind farm, was burdened with 0.137 kWh Primary Energy-Equivalent and 32 g CO2-Equivalent, which represented only a small proportion of the accordant values for the mix. Furthermore, the offshore foundations as well as the submarine cable were the main energy intensive components. The energetic and greenhouse gas payback period was less than one year.Therefore, offshore wind power, even in deep water, is compatible with the switch to sustainable electricity production relying on renewable energies. Additional research, taking backup power plants as well as increasingly required energy storage systems into account, will allow further calculation. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mooring systems are required to keep floating wave energy converters (WECs) on station. The mooring concept might impact the performance of the WEC, its cost and its integrity. With the aim of clarifying the pros and cons of different mooring designs, we present the results from physical model experiments of three different mooring concepts in regular and irregular waves, including operational and survival conditions. The parameters investigated are the tension in the cables, the motions of the device in the different degrees of freedom and the seabed footprint in each case. We can see that the mooring system affects the performance of the wave energy converter, but the magnitude of the impact depends on the parameter analysed, on the mode of motion studied and on the conditions of the sea. Moreover, different configurations have similar performances in some situations and the choice of one over another might come down to factors such as the type of soil of the seabed, the spacing desired between devices, or environmental impacts. The results of our experiments provide information for a better selection of the mooring system for a wave energy converter when several constraints are taken into account (power production, maximum displacements, extreme tensions, etc).

AB  - A high resolution Computational Flow Dynamics (CFD) numerical model is built based on a laboratory experiment in this research to study impacts of tidal turbines on surface wave dynamics. A reduction of similar to 3\% in wave height is observed under the influence of a standalone turbine located 0.4 m from the free surface. The artificial wave energy dissipation routine `OBSTACLE' within FVCOM is shown to effectively capture the correct level of wave height reduction, reproducing the CFD results with significantly less computational effort. The turbine simulation system is then applied to a series of test cases to investigate impact of a standalone turbine on bed shear stress. Results suggest an apparent increase in bed stress (similar to 7\%) up-stream of the turbine due to the inclusion of surface waves. However, in the immediate wake of the turbine, bed stress is dominated by the presence of the turbine itself, accounting for a similar to 50\% increase, with waves having a seemingly negligible effect up to 9D (D is the turbine diameter) downstream of the turbine. Beyond this point, the effect of waves on bed shear stress become apparent again. The influence of OBSTACLE on bed stress is also noticeable in the far wake, showing a reduction of similar to 2\% in wave height. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The detrimental environmental impacts of climate change that are a result of high atmospheric CO2 concentrations have prompted global efforts to limit the continuous increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Many are now relying on the deployment of various carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) methods which have been found reliable for reducing CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Various industries are shifting towards the decarbonisation of their operations through the use of a combination of various CCUS activities. This could involve the conversion of CO2 into value-added chemicals, the utilization of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), the injection of CO2 into geological formations and/or oceans, the biological fixation of CO2, and other similar activities. Such operations are often referred to as CO2 â€œsinksâ€. It is often crucial for industries to identify which CCUS operations to deploy, especially when faced with many choices, since factors such as the cost of implementation and the sink efficiency play a significant role in the sink selection process. In this work, a mathematical model that helps identify optimal CO2 sink locations within industrial clusters is developed and utilized. Identifying optimal sink locations is an important factor that needs to be considered as part of a CCUS network planning problem.

TI  - Trace element bias in the use of CO2 vents as analogues for low pH environments: Implications for contamination levels in acidified oceans
JO  - Estuarine Coastal And Shelf Science
PY  - 2013
VL  - 134
IS  - NA
AB  - Research into the effects of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems has increasingly focused on natural CO2 vents, although their intrinsic environmental complexity means observations from these areas may not relate exclusively to pH gradients. In order to assess trace element levels and distribution in the Levante Bay (Vulcano Island, NE Sicily, Italy) and its suitability for studying biological effects of pH decline, Ba, Fe and trace elements (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, V and Zn) in sediment were analysed from 7 transects. Where present, Cymodocea nodosa leaves and epiphytes were also analysed. At the spatial scale of the bay, trace element concentrations in sediments and biota showed wide variability, possibly related to both input from fluid emissions and seawater physico-chemical variables (i.e. pH and Eh), which may considerably affect the solubility and bioavailability of potentially harmful trace elements. According to two pollution indices (MSPI: Marine Sediment Pollution Index and SQG-Q: Sediment Quality Guideline Quotient), the bay can be considered to be affected by low contamination with moderate potential for adverse biological effects, especially in the area between about 150 and 350 m from the primary vent, where localized detrimental effects on biota may occur. Generally, biological samples showed concentrations that were comparable with the lower values of seagrass ranges. The overall results of this study support the complex spatial dynamics of trace elements in the CO2 vent studied, which are constrained by both direct input from the vent and/or biogeochemical processes affecting element precipitation at the sediment-seawater interface. Consequently, great caution should be used when relating biological changes along pH gradients to the unifactorial effect of pH only, as interactions with concurrent, multiple stressors, including trace element enrichments, may occur. This finding has implications for the use of CO2 vents as analogues in ocean acidification research. They should be considered more appropriately as analogues for low pH environments with non-negligible trace element contamination which, in a scenario of continuous increase in anthropogenic pollution, may be very common.

AB  - Power solutions for seagoing vessels have typically been designed to enable operation at maximum economic speeds based on hydrodynamic considerations, and to ensure that vessels have the necessary power to be seaworthy and maneuverable in heavy weather and in high sea states. Historically, fuel costs have been low compared to fixed and other variable costs, but more recently, rising fuel prices and environmental concerns have made it more attractive to reduce fuel consumption through lower steaming speeds. Since speed reduction drastically reduces power requirements, it has become common to operate at 15 to 50% of the installed power in calm to moderate sea conditions. When engines operate at low power, fuel consumption per kWh produced power increases slightly, while the emissions of exhaust gases increase rapidly due to incomplete combustion. This study investigates flexible hybrid power solutions, i.e. power take out (PTO), power take in (PTI) and batteries in combination with internal combustion engines. The focus is on the full operational range from being idle at berth to the peak power needed in critical situations in high sea states. Our results indicate that hybrid solutions are cost-competitive with traditional engine setups. They also reduce the environmental impact, including greenhouse gas emissions and cost effectively satisfies IMOâ€™s energy efficiency requirements (EEDI).

JO  - Energies
PY  - 2021
VL  - 14

AB  - Liquefied natural gas has attracted attention through an explosive increase in demands and environmental requirements. During this period, the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), which was adopted by the International Maritime Organization, expecting to significantly reduce CO2 from ships, has become an important key. It has triggered a change in use from steam turbine systems and dual fuel diesel electrics to highâ€efficiency main engines such as MEâ€GI engines to meet the EEDI requirements. However, since the MEâ€GI engines use 300 bar of fuel gas pressure, it is necessary to resolve problems of the pressure controllability and to prevent the reductions of the reâ€liquefaction amount caused by clogging of the lubricant mixed with the fuel gas during the compression. The purpose of this study is to propose a novel control strategy with a newly developed configuration for controlling the pressure so as not to trip the BOG compressors when the MEâ€GI engines are tripped, and for preventing a reduction on reâ€liquefaction amount. Unlike the typical configuration used in the current vessels, this proposal separately provides the fuel gas at 150 bar without lubricants to the reâ€liquefaction. In addition, three control strategies are proposed, depending upon the application of multiâ€controllers and the location of the pressure transmitters. A simulation was conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed method, focusing on the controllability of the pressure and the reâ€liquefaction amount, in comparison with the typical configuration. As results of the simulation, the proposal showed excellent controllability without trips of the BOG compressors even in abnormal conditions and confirmed the great reliquefaction performance.

AB  - The outcomes from the two IMO Greenhouse Gas Studies (2009 & 2014) (IMO, 2008), (IMO, 2016), highlighted the magnitude of shipping's impact on climate change. This, in combination with the rather stringent regulations, which are continuously being adopted, have resulted in the development of innovative and energy efficient technologies aiming at mitigating shipping's impact on the environment. This design project proposes an energy efficient solution aiming at the reduction of air emissions generated by the fleet of one of the largest sections of international shipping, containerships. By designing a containerised battery system capable of providing 10.3MWh of useful energy, the ultimate aim is to replace an existing diesel generator and to operate the battery system on manoeuvring. With the aid of a load planner software it was ensured that such a system can be loaded on-board a specific containership, without a negative impact on the stability and the structural integrity of the employed vessel. The battery system can be charged both by a shore supply (cold ironing) as well as during the seagoing part of the voyage. The energy feasibility of such a system and the emissions reduction were verified by developing several software models, which allowed various case study trips to be investigated. Results from the case studies suggested that with such a system on-board, emissions can be reduced by 19% when the ship carries only normal containers and by 4 % when the ship carries normal and refrigerated containers. However, the performed financial analysis indicated that such an investment would result to a loss, primarily due to the current price of battery systems.

AB  - The fuel type selection according to optimal pathway from extraction of a raw material (feedstock) to its processing to transportation and finally its use in marine engines (well to wheel) based on the cost and emission criteria is the main motivation factor to conduct the current investigation. The undertaken procedure has been customized based on the available data (ship/bunker route and mileage, the ship powertrain system, etc.) of the shipping industry under the SeaTechH2020project (seatech2020.eu). Theselectedmodeling platformis utilizedfor thelife cycleassessmentofthree potential fuels of diesel, methanol, and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Different fuel production pathways and powertrain dual-fuel technologies havebeen takenintoaccountas the mainvariables, while the subsidiary factors such as transportation parameters (fuel economy andAvg. speed) are includedin the calculations. The economic aspect and emission reduction trade-off for various scenarios are conducted to introduce the optimal solution based on the stakeholder interest in the shipping industry. The study also considers the fuel transport to the respective ports for a selected vessel from diverse fuel export locations andtravelled routes accordingtodatasets available for the same project.

PY  - 2016
VL  - 13
IS  - 20
AB  - Quantifying marine sedimentary carbon stocks is key to improving our understanding of long-term storage of carbon in the coastal ocean and to further constraining the global carbon cycle. Here we present a methodological approach which combines seismic geophysics and geochemical measurements to quantitatively estimate the total stock of carbon held within marine sediment. Through the application of this methodology to Loch Sunart, a fjord on the west coast of Scotland, we have generated the first full sedimentary carbon inventory for a fjordic system. The sediments of Loch Sunart hold 26.9 +/- 0.5 Mt of carbon split between 11.5 +/- 0.2 and 15.0 +/- 0.4 Mt of organic and inorganic carbon respectively. These new quantitative estimates of carbon stored in coastal sediments are significantly higher than previous estimates. Through an area-normalised comparison to adjacent Scottish peatland carbon stocks, we have determined that these mid-latitude fjords are significantly more effective as carbon stores than their terrestrial counterparts. This initial work supports the concept that fjords are important environments for the burial and long-term storage of carbon and therefore should be considered and treated as unique environments within the global carbon cycle.

TI  - Guidelines and cost-benefit analysis of the Structural Health Monitoring implementation in offshore wind turbine support structures

VL  - 12
IS  - 6
AB  - This paper investigates how the implementation of Structural Health Monitoring Systems (SHMS) in the support structure (SS) of offshore wind turbines (OWT) affects capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operational expenditure (OPEX) of offshore wind farms (WF). In order to determine the added value of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), the balance between the reduction in OPEX and the increase in CAPEX is evaluated. In this paper, guidelines for SHM implementation in offshore WF are developed and applied to a baseline scenario. The application of these guidelines consist of a review of present regulations in the United Kingdom and Germany, the development of SHM strategy, where the first stage of the Statistical Pattern Recognition (SPR) paradigm is explored, failure modes that can be monitored are identified, and SHM technologies and sensor distributions within the turbines are described for a baseline scenario. Furthermore, an inspection strategy where the different structural inspections to be carried out above and below water is also developed, together with an inspection plan for the lifetime of the structures, for the aforementioned baseline scenario. Once the guidelines have been followed and the SHM and inspection strategies developed, a cost-benefit analysis is performed on the baseline case (10% instrumented assets) and three other scenarios with 20%, 30% and 50% of instrumented assets. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the effects of SHM hardware cost and the time spent in completing the inspections on OPEX and CAPEX of the WF. The results show that SHM hardware cost increases CAPEX significantly, however this increase is much lower than the reduction in OPEX caused by SHM. The results also show that an increase in the percentage of instrumented assets will reduce OPEX and this reduction is considerably higher than the cost of SHM implementation. Â© 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The Arctic Ocean is a potentially important sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) With a recent estimate suggesting that the region Contributes from 5 to 14\% of the global ocean's net uptake of CO2. In the western Arctic, Ocean, the focus of this paper the Chukchir Sea is a Ocean sink for CO2 compensated for by outgassing of CO2 from the East Siberian Sea shelf. The Arctic marine carbon cycle and exchange of CO2 between the ocean and atmosphere appear particularly sensitive to environmental changes, including sea ice loss, warming, changes in seasonal marine phytoplankton primary production, changes in ocean circulation and freshwater inputs, and even the impacts of ocean acidification. In the near term, further sea ice loss, increases in phytoplankton growth rates, and other environmental and physical changes in the Arctic are expected to cause a limited net increase in the uptake of CO2 by Arctic surface waters. Recent studies suggest that this enhanced uptake will be short lived, with surface waters rapidly warming and equilibrating with the atmosphere. Furthermore, release of large stores of carbon from the surrounding Arctic landmasses through rivers into the Arctic Ocean and further warming over the next century may alter the Arctic from a CO2 sink to a source over the next century.

IS  - NA
AB  - The design of an offshore energy storage system carries unknowns which need to be studied at an early stage of the project to avoid unnecessary costs of failures. These risks have led to an increasing dependence on more sophisticated mathematical models. This paper refers specifically to energy storage in the offshore wind farming industry and has the objective of proposing an adiabatic compressed air energy (A-CAES) system which would be integrated on a semi-submersible offshore wind turbine (OWT) platform. Calculations in respect to the sizing of the main sub-components of the system are included and estimates for the overall round trip efficiency are presented. Preliminary calculations to size the various parts of the energy storage system (ESS) have been carried out based on the energy availability of an offshore 8 MW wind turbine with real wind data from the North Sea. The load data to determine the lowest 12-hour demand period was taken from the Nordpool database. The calculations of the proposed conceptual design are based on an operational scenario in which the 24-hour period of a particular day is split in a 12-hour charging and 12-hour discharging cycle. For charging, a 5-bank, 2-stage compressor train is used to pressurize a number of steel cylindrical vessels with compressed air. This is followed by a process in which the compressed air is discharged across 12 hours using a 2-bank, 2-stage expander turbine. The multiple compression banks enable a modular power delivery to the air storage vessels, with the number of compressors utilized varying subject to wind availability. The two stages allowed for the air to be cooled in between the stages using heat exchangers, transferring the heat of compression to a pressurized sea water circuit. The hot water would be stored in thermally insulated vessels at 3500C to heat the inlet expanding air in the discharge period. A 70 and 100 Bar charging scenarios, both with a cushion pressure (CP) in the air storage vessel (ASV) of 10 Bar at the end of the discharge cycle have been considered. Standard performance criteria are calculated such as compression and expansion ratios, inlet and outlet temperatures for the respective expansion and compression air streams and flow rates within the heat exchangers to come up with an indicative sizing proposal for the respective turbo machinery and storage vessels making up the system. Round trip efficiencies are also calculated. The study determined that a CAES system consisting of 9 compressed air storage vessels operating with a peak pressure of 100 Bar should meet the storage requirements. It is also estimated that the entire CAES system would require around 1082 m2 of deck area on the platform to accommodate the pressure vessels, the compressor and expander trains, the heat exchanger and the hot water storage vessel.

AB  - Public opinion shares a deep concern on the environmental impact of pollutants emitted by transport vectors in the air. Even if ships contribute to only 3.5% of the total CO2 emissions, all the marine stack-holders shall join in the objective of further reducing the emission levels from ships in the next few years. IMO is enforcing this objective via the introduction of new regulations on the energy efficiency of new-buildings and existing ships. The amendments to MARPOL Annex VI Regulations, add a new chapter 4 to Annex VI on Regulations on energy efficiency for ships to make mandatory the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) for all ships. Other amendments to Annex VI add new definitions and the requirements for survey and certification, including the format for the International Energy Efficiency Certificate. The regulations apply to all ships of 400 gross tonnages and above and are expected to enter into force on 1 January 2013. On the other hand there is in this case a virtuous relationship between environmental care and economic convenience, especially as far as operational energy saving measures are concerned, as with the increasing costs of fuel every operational action which may increase the energy efficiency of the ship without any expensive re-fitting is expected to reduce the operational costs. It is recognized that monitoring of performance is the pivot around which the SEEMP is cycling as it provides a concrete basis upon which to set-up the planning and evaluate the results thus leading to the requirement for further improvement. Continuous on-line monitoring and immediate availability of all relevant data to the ship stack-holders is also the cornerstone of any progress towards increased ship autonomy. The ship Automation System is the natural candidate to act as the primary collector of all the data relevant to energy efficiency and as the manager of all the processes / plants which may affect the energy efficiency of the ship.

AB  - The article presents the regulations of the International Maritime Organization aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions from international shipping. One of the main objectives is to search the alternative to fossil fuels. The main problem is the lack of indication of the target fuel for shipping. The current changes, forced by international regulations, are made by the decisions of shipowners who themselves are looking for an alternative fuel that will enable them to continue their activities. Attempts have been made to use fuels considered as transient, which will be used in the perspective of about 10 years. However, this is too short a time compared to the life of the ship (20â€“30 years). This will force another change in the type of fuel used on ships still in operation, which will result in additional costs associated with the adaptation of the shipâ€™s power plant fuel systems to a different type of fuel. The article evaluates the changes that currently taking place. Scenarios of the most likely directions of changes in a perspective of 2050 have been indicated. Â© 2022, Politechnika Lubelska.

AB  - This article aims to develop a novel hybrid offshore wind-wave energy conversion system (HOW-WECS) configuration which can successfully feed a stable power to the customers of remote communities in near-shore areas or remote islands. The proposed configuration uses a minimum number of converters for the integration of the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind energy system with the direct-drive linear permanent magnet generator (DDLPMG) based wave energy system. Advanced control schemes for the DFIG and the DDLPMG are presented to enhance the power extraction from the implemented HOW-WECS. The dynamic and the transient performance of the proposed system and the associated control schemes are tested under various operating scenarios and electrical fault conditions. The dynamic performance was acceptable as the implemented control strategies were able to keep the stator voltage and the stator current of the DFIG sinusoidal and balanced, the frequency excursions are within the acceptable band, and the common ac-bus voltage of the distribution network stable under all operating scenarios. The results prove the effectiveness of the proposed system under transient conditions and the ability of the proposed HOW-WECS to recover quickly to gain its pre-fault conditions once the fault was cleared.

JO  - Journal Of Marine Science And Engineering
PY  - 2022
VL  - 10

AB  - Horizontal-axis tidal current turbines have considerable potential to harvest renewable energy from ocean tides. The pitch control system is a critical part of variable-pitch tidal turbines. Existing control strategies for tidal turbines mainly rely on flow measurement devices to obtain tidal velocities, which are costly and subject to many limitations in practical applications, making them unsuitable for small off-grid tidal turbines. In this paper, we propose a pitch control strategy for a 120 kW horizontal-axis tidal current turbine based on the output power of the generator. The torque of the turbine was calculated based on the blade element momentum theory, and a dynamic model of the tidal turbine was established. The dynamic characteristics of the turbine and generator were studied under various flow rates and pitch angles. On the basis of the characteristic analysis, the generating efficiency of the unit was improved under a low flow rate, and the output power was limited to a rated value under high-current velocity by regulating the pitch angle. Furthermore, a novel protection and start up strategy is proposed to protect the unit and make full use of the tidal energy when the tidal current velocity exceeds the limit value. We performed simulations, the obtained results of which demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the designed control strategies.

Data-driven methods are employed first to approximately obtain a known analytic expression for isotropic local blockage effects, and then deployed to find candidate expressions for anisotropic local blockage effects. The dataset for the analysis of anisotropic local blockage is collected from 3D Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of an infinitely wide array of actuator disks for nearly 2,000 different blockage configurations. This study builds upon previous work in array optimisation of both tidal and wind turbines, where the local power coefficient may increase substantially for optimal array configuration. A brief discussion on the relationship between the local blockage and wind farm blockage is also provided. Other theoretical approaches and possible refinements to the presented analytic model are also discussed. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

PY  - NA
VL  - NA

AB  - Understanding phytoplankton community shifts under multiple stressors is becoming increasingly important. Among other combinations of stressors, the impact of trace metal toxicity on marine phytoplankton under the ocean acidification scenario is an important aspect to address. Such multiple stressor studies are rare from the Arabian Sea, one of the highest productive oceanic provinces within the North Indian Ocean. We studied the interactive impacts of copper (Cu) and CO2 enrichment on two natural phytoplankton communities from the eastern and central Arabian Sea. Low dissolved silicate (DSi < 2 mu M) favoured smaller diatoms (e.g. Nitzschia sp.) and non-diatom (Phaeocystis). CO2 enrichment caused both positive (Nitzschia sp. and Phaeocystis sp.) and negative (Cylindrotheca closterium, Navicula sp., Pseudo-nitzschia sp., Alexandrium sp., and Gymnodinium sp.) growth impacts. The addition of Cu under the ambient CO2 level (A-CO2) hindered cell division in most of the species, whereas Chla contents were nearly unaffected. Interestingly, CO2 enrichment seemed to alleviate Cu toxicity in some species (Nitzschia sp., Cylindrotheca closterium, Guinardia flaccida, and Phaeocystis) and increased their growth rates. This could be related to the cellular Cu demand and energy budget at elevated CO2 levels. Dinoflagellates were more sensitive to Cu supply compared to diatoms and prymnesiophytes and could be related to the unavailability of prey. Such community shifts in response to the projected ocean acidification, oligotrophy, and Cu pollution may impact trophic transfer and carbon cycling in this region.

AB  - Ship hull and propeller fouling has a severe impact both on fuel costs and on greenhouse gas emission, thus, it is an important subject to consider when developing a maintenance plan to enhance energy efficiency and reduce gas emissions from ships. This paper presents a two-step approach for evaluating the actual propulsive performance of a ship through analyzing continuous onboard measurement. First, the onboard monitored data are corrected for the wind and wave effects using fast and transparent empirical methods. Second, the corrected data are filtered based on hydrodynamic criteria. A case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology. Subsequently, the processed data are analyzed by mathematical tools to derive an engine power-rpm curve to represent the actual propulsive performance of the ship. By comparing the derived curve against the nominal curve for engine design, it is possible to identify the deterioration of the ship's condition, which is the key task in developing the identification capability that is needed in a proactive maintenance procedure. This methodology is expected to support the maritime sector in combating climate change by reducing the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from ship operations.

AB  - A brief review of the literature is provided on the characteristics of marine currents and the approaches used for simulating tidal turbines. The feasibility of using CFD models to simulate time-dependent turbulent flow around a tidal turbine is then explored. Two different approaches for specifying the structure of the turbulent inflow conditions in CFD models are compared: the von Karman spectral approach and the Synthetic Eddy Method (SEM) of Jarrin et al. (2006). The former model is commonly employed in the wind industry and is coded into Garrad Hassan's Tidal Bladed and NREL's TurbSim. Different approaches are also tested for decomposing the turbulence at the inlet into resolved and modelled components. The results from these tests indicate that the turbulence produced using the SEM inlet conditions is slightly less susceptible to decay with downstream distance than the von Karman approach provided that the modelled turbulent kinetic energy accounts for only a small fraction of the total turbulence energy. Simulations of the unsteady flow around a tidal turbine, represented here as a simple porous disc, provide some insight into the effect of large-scale flow oscillations on the wake of the turbine. The wake structures obtained from unsteady CFD simulations are compared to those obtained using a steady approach. The results indicate that the presence of large coherent turbulent structures in the incident flow field produces a shorter wake than predicted by steady flow simulations. This work represents the first stage in the development of a unified model which will couple meta-scale simulations of flow in an estuary or complete channel to detailed small-scale simulations of the flow around tidal turbine devices.

AB  - Hybrid ship as a kind of transport mode with high energy consumption, the monitoring of energy consumption and the control of energy conservation and emission reduction are particularly important. Therefore, effective energy consumption monitoring and emission control methods in the process of ship operation have attracted great attention in related fields. Therefore, this study optimized the structure of the energy consumption monitoring equipment for hybrid ships, and achieved the energy consumption monitoring and control by effectively collecting the energy consumption data of hybrid ships. The application of real-time monitoring system for ship energy consumption can better monitor the energy consumption of hybrid ships and realize the treatment and control of energy conservation and emission reduction according to the monitoring results. At the same time, according to the current situation of ship energy consumption management, through the analysis of the characteristics of ship operation and diesel engine fuel system, this study proposed a low loss, high precision mass flowmeter, to achieve the requirements of energy conservation and emission reduction control. Based on this, strengthening ship basic management, saving Marine fuel and reducing pollution can achieve a win-win situation between economy and environment.

JO  - Sustainable Energy Grids \& Networks
PY  - 2016
VL  - 5
IS  - NA
AB  - In this paper, the investigation of an offshore wind energy conversion system with a high frequency link is continued. The design of the conversion system aims for a high efficiency and low weight and volume. It is composed of a permanent magnet generator, an AC-AC converter, a high frequency transformer and a diode bridge rectifier. The system is intended for a DC collection grid of turbines connected in series. Three different AC-AC converters are considered: the direct and indirect matrix converter and the back-to-back converter. The design of the entire conversion system is presented with emphasis on the converter and the high frequency transformer. The efficiencies of these two components as well as filters are assessed using a simulation model of the conversion system and device datasheet for the converter and analytical analysis for the transformer and filters. The conversion systems with the three converters show comparable efficiency performance; the system with the matrix converter however displaying the highest efficiency of 96.53\%, the indirect matrix converter 86.4\% and the back-to-back the lowest, 96.36\% or 93.51\% depending on the filter design. This paper is the prequel to a second part where the conversion system is further developed to improve the converter efficiency and the transformer design. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper presents the initial work on a fixed multi-chamber OWC (MCOWC) concept. The paper reports theoretical and experimental modeling. It begins with initial tests to verify the simple idealized model of a fixed OWC multi-chamber concept. These take place under small-amplitude regular-wave wave tank conditions. The analysis is carried through to assess the effect of the Capture Width (Hydrodynamic efficiency). Experimental data is put forward from the mounting of level sensors and anemometers to test the hydrodynamic performance of a fixed MCOWC at different wave periods. The orifice effects of the chamber on the relative amplitudes of the inner free water surface and air flow rate in the duct are investigated. The experimental results will be used as real case data in order to optimize the orifice area and to maximize the chamber power according to the air flow velocity above the water surface inside the chambers.

VL  - 46

AB  - Plug-in hybrid fuel cell and battery propulsion systems appear promising for decarbonising transportation applications such as road vehicles and coastal ships. However, it is challenging to develop optimal or near-optimal energy management for these systems without exact knowledge of future load profiles. Although efforts have been made to develop strategies in a stochastic environment with discrete state space using Q-learning and Double Q-learning, such tabular reinforcement learning agents' effectiveness is limited due to the state space resolution. This article aims to develop an improved energy management system using deep reinforcement learning to achieve enhanced cost-saving by extending discrete state parameters to be continuous. The improved energy management system is based upon the Double Deep Q-Network. Real-world collected stochastic load profiles are applied to train the Double Deep Q-Network for a coastal ferry. The results suggest that the Double Deep Q-Network acquired energy management strategy has achieved a further 5.5\% cost reduction with a 93.8\% decrease in training time, compared to that produced by the Double Q-learning agent in discrete state space without function approximations. In addition, this article also proposes an adaptive deep reinforcement learning energy management scheme for practical hybrid-electric propulsion systems operating in changing environments.

TI  - Norwegian ship-owners' adoption of alternative fuels
JO  - Energy Policy

AB  - The shipping sector's rising greenhouse gas emissions are often considered â€œhard-to-abateâ€. Some ship-owners have recently adopted or started to consider the adoption of alternative fuels, but systematic studies of this are still lacking. We address this gap by studying how ship-owners differ in both actual and intended adoption of alternative fuels. We analyze data from a unique survey with 281 ship-owners in Norway, a major ship-owning country and center for maritime technology development, with descriptive statistics and analysis of variance. We find early adopters among large and established ship-owners in offshore, international cargo and domestic passenger shipping segments, which are often subjected to specific contractual demands for alternative fuel adoption. Laggards were typically small and young ship-owners operating in shipping segments where demands for alternative fuel adoption are weak. Our findings also suggest that firms' business strategy and financial and knowledge resources may have relevance for ship-owner's adoption of alternative fuels. Our study has implications for national and international policymaking, highlighting for example how contracting mechanisms can be an effective tool in incentivizing the adoption of alternative fuels.

TI  - A data-driven study of IMO compliant fuel emissions with consideration of black carbon aerosols
JO  - Ocean Engineering
PY  - 2020
VL  - 218
IS  - NA
AB  - The shipping industry has been facing increasing pressure to reduce environmental emissions. For instance, starting in 2020 the International Maritime Organization (IMO) required a reduction of the global sulfur limit for shipping fuels outside designated Sulfur Emission Control Areas (SECA) from 3.5% to 0.5% on a mass basis. Other pollutants are also being targeted for short-term and long-term reduction. Aiming at providing sustainable fuel solutions for the stage of tank to propeller, this manuscript evaluates various shipping fuel options focusing on quantitatively comparing the fuel consumption and emissions of major air pollutants. A bottom-up emission inventory model is developed by analyzing and optimizing multiple sources of load factors, specific fuel consumption and emission factors. Rather than taking deterministic emission leading values, this work improves the model quality by considering external factors and the latest emission data and processing a detailed ship-by-ship calculation for the ship database collected by the shipboard Automatic Identification System (AIS). The amounts of carbon dioxide for the main engine, auxiliary engine and auxiliary boilier are firstly calculated, and then the fuel consumption per nautical mile are computed by integrating CO2 intensity. Next, ship exhaust gases are calculated for two categories: (i) gases impacting the global warming potential (GWP) and (ii) the non-GWP gases. Besides sustainable solutions within one specific ship fleet, this work firstly establishes a nautical mile-based fuel consumption per unit of capacity bin for major merchant ships to serve as a basis for finding an optimized fuel solution among different ship types. In addition to addressing the typical ship-source pollutants, this work also focuses on negative environmental effects resulting from BCA because it has not been thoroughly considered in the literatures despite its contribution to GWP. To illustrate the value and applicability of the proposed approach, a case study is solved to estimate the cumulative fuel consumption and GWP-related gas emission inventory for a transoceanic trip from Houston to Rotterdam. The results demonstrate that the GWP gas emissions of heavy fuel oil with scrubber are 38% more than those of one LNG dual-engine option. Explicit consideration is also given to BCA emissions. The results indicate that the blended fuel aimed at satisfying the IMO 2020 Sulfur Cap does not perform well in BCA emission control. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recently, demands for the application of energy saving devices on ships are rapidly increasing in many shipping and/or shipbuilding companies to prepare upcoming regulations on the reduction of the green house gas emission and enlarging CO2 emissions trading market. In developing such devices, it is crucial to understand their hydrodynamic characteristics and to consider their corresponding effects accurately on the powering performance of a ship when applied. In this study, a number of model tests for several large container vessels were performed to investigate effects of a "rudder bulb" on the powering performance. From these investigations, a modified extrapolation method of full scale wake fraction is proposed which can be reflected into the practical evaluation of the rudder bulb acting on the full scale wake field. In near future, the proposed method will be verified by comparing the powering performance of full scale sea trials with that of model tests. Â© 2010 COPPE/UFRJ.

VL  - NA

AB  - The north Irish Sea is earmarked for the development of several offshore wind farms. The complex Quaternary history of this area has resulted in a legacy of geotechnically challenging deposits, including heterogeneous glacial deposits, soft sediments and gas-charged sediments. Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) is commonly used onshore to produce shear wave velocity (Vs) profiles and is increasingly being used offshore (UMASW). When used in tandem with in-situ Cone Penetration Testing (CPTU) profiles it is a powerful tool for characterising offshore deposits. UMASW profiles were obtained from sites across the north Irish Sea coincident with CPTU profiles. Vs profiles from UMASW show good agreement with CPTU parameters in a range of geological settings. The purpose of this paper is to present a characterisation of geological deposits using a combined approach of CPTU and UMASW. By doing so the aim is to further develop classification charts that can give reliable characterisations of offshore deposits by combing non-invasive geophysical techniques and traditional CPTU.

JO  - Nature
PY  - 2022
VL  - 603
IS  - 7901
AB  - Carbon storage by the ocean and by the land is usually quantified separately, and does not fully take into account the land-to-ocean transport of carbon through inland waters, estuaries, tidal wetlands and continental shelf waters-the `land-to-ocean aquatic continuum' (LOAC). Here we assess LOAC carbon cycling before the industrial period and perturbed by direct human interventions, including climate change. In our view of the global carbon cycle, the traditional `long-range loop', which carries carbon from terrestrial ecosystems to the open ocean through rivers, is reinforced by two `short-range loops' that carry carbon from terrestrial ecosystems to inland waters and from tidal wetlands to the open ocean. Using a mass-balance approach, we find that the pre-industrial uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide by terrestrial ecosystems transferred to the ocean and outgassed back to the atmosphere amounts to 0.65 +/- 0.30 petagrams of carbon per year (+/- 2 sigma). Humans have accelerated the cycling of carbon between terrestrial ecosystems, inland waters and the atmosphere, and decreased the uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide from tidal wetlands and submerged vegetation. Ignoring these changing LOAC carbon fluxes results in an overestimation of carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems by 0.6 +/- 0.4 petagrams of carbon per year, and an underestimation of sedimentary and oceanic carbon storage. We identify knowledge gaps that are key to reduce uncertainties in future assessments of LOAC fluxes. An assessment of the land-to-ocean cycling of carbon through inland waters, estuaries, tidal wetlands and continental shelf waters provides a perspective on the global carbon cycle and identifies key knowledge gaps.

The 100 LNG carriers represent â‰ˆ 25% of the current global fleet. WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤'s dual-fuel technology was first launched in the early 1990s for use in land-based power plant applications. The first marine installation of the 5ODF engine came a decade later. The technology allows the engine to be operated on either natural gas, light fuel oil, or heavy fuel oil, and switching between fuels can take place seamlessly during operation, without loss of power or speed, which ensures safety and continuous installation operability. The engine is designed to have the same output regardless of the fuel used.

AB  - This paper presents optimal generation scheduling for minimization of fuel consumption (FC) in a typical offshore support vessel with DC power system architecture employing four identical diesel generator (DG) sets. FC is analyzed for (i) equal load sharing among DGs in AC architecture, (ii) equal load sharing among DGs in DC architecture and (iii) optimal load sharing among DGs in DC architecture using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Due to the presence of non-linearity in Specific FC (SFC) curves of the diesel engines, the PSO algorithm is used. The SFC-vs-load relationship obtained from Brake SFC (BSFC) map of the diesel engines is characterized using a Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (PCHIP) interpolation. A solution to problem has been attained by comparing yearly fuel consumption in the three cases for the load profile of target vessel. This method can be applied to any vessel equipped with multiple generation units having DC power system architecture.

AB  - The emission of greenhouse gases has grown in unprecedented levels since the beginning of the industrial era. As a result, global climate changes, such as heightened global temperature and ocean acidification, are expected to negatively impact populations. Similarly, industrial and urban unsustainable development are also expected to impose local impacts of their own, such as environmental pollution with organic and inorganic chemicals. As an answer, biomarkers can be used in environmental programs to assess these impacts. These tools are based in the quantification of biochemical and cellular responses of target species that are known to respond in a sensitive and specific way to such stresses. In this context, carbonic anhydrase has shown to be a promising biomarker candidate for the assessment of global and local impacts in biomonitoring programs, especially in marine zones, such as coral reefs, considering the pivotal role of this enzyme in the calcification process. Therefore, the aim of this review is to show the recent advances in the carbonic anhydrase research and the reasons why it can be considered as a promising biomarker to be used for calcifying organisms.

JO  - Journal Of Cleaner Production
PY  - 2019
VL  - 232
IS  - NA
AB  - Marine macroalgae (seaweed) has many advantages over terrestrial crops as a source of renewable biomass but is severely underutilised at present, especially within Europe. In particular, macroalgae has elevated poly- and monosaccharide content, making it an ideal feedstock as a heterotrophic fermentation sugar source for the production of higher value chemicals. Recent reports have detailed the suitability of seaweeds as a feedstock for the production of single-cell oils (SCOs) which have application in food, oleochemicals and fuels. It is proposed that a biorefinery system based on the production of SCOs alongside other secondary metabolites, has the potential to provide a sustainable replacement to terrestrial oils such as palm oil. This work therefore evaluates, for the first time, the environmental and economic sustainability of a production process for SCOs from seaweed Saccharina latissima using the oleaginous yeast Metschnikowia pulcherrima. Two alternative fermentation systems were considered, and uncertainties associated with the seasonal variation in seaweed carbohydrate yield and fermentation performance were integrated into the analysis. From an environmental perspective, the work indicates that seaweed derived SCO lipids and fats can be comparable to a terrestrial oil mix, with a potential climate change impact ranging between 2.5 and 9.9 kg CO2 eq. kg(-1) refined SCO. Interestingly and of particular significance, environmental impacts are mainly dominated by energy demand within fermentation and upstream processing steps. From an economic perspective, a break-even selling price for the oil was determined as between epsilon 5,300-epsilon 31,000 tonne(-1) refined SCO, which was highly dependent on cost of the seaweed feedstock. Overall, we demonstrate that key uncertainties relating to seaweed cultivation costs and hydrolysate fermentation at scale result in a large range in values for environmental impact and economic return on investment. Yet even within the constraints and limitations of current knowhow, seaweed already offers a viable proposition for the competitive production of exotic oils similar to cocoa or shea butter in price and nature.

In addition, we point out that ecosystem services in the mitigation of climate change must be referenced against a manufacturing process, such as cement's normal lifetime of carbon dioxide sequestration. Without such a reference state, sequestration services may be severely overestimated and when used within a cap and trade system, it will lead to an increased rate of carbon dioxide emissions.

The key issues in this field are to understand the interaction between bodies; and develop the awareness of how to utilize the impact of these. This paper describes a set of numerical simulations designed to investigate the optimum configuration of a simple two-body point absorber model. The results confirm that the ability to extract energy depends on the mass and geometry of the moving parts, together with the damping of generator. It is also demonstrated that the outcome is sensitive to the distance between the two moving bodies and local wave condition.

AB  - Injection of CO2 into basaltic formations provides significant benefits including permanent storage by mineralisation and large storage volume. The largest geological storage potential lies offshore and in the case of basalt, along the mid-oceanic ridges where CO2 could be stored as carbonate minerals for thousands of years. Most of the bedrock, both on land and offshore Iceland consists of basalt that could theoretically be used for injection of CO2, fully dissolved in water. The most feasible formations are the youngest formations located within the active rift zone. It is estimated that up to 7000 GtCO(2) could be stored offshore Iceland within the Exclusive Economic Zone. Site specific geological research and pilot studies are required for refining the concept and offshore pilot scale projects should be considered as the next steps in evolving the method.

AB  - Almost all of the motors in ships are two-stroke engines, the most efficient main drivers available for large ships needing long range performance. Until these engines are replaced by alternatives the focus will be on new fuels, particularly, alternative fuels to replace high sulfur fuel oil. LNG is considered the alternative fuel frontrunner. Producing almost no SOx or particulate matter emissions, LNG also boasts low NOx emissions and GHG emission reduction benefits (from fuel tank to stack) of between up to 22%, dependent on engine type. Despite these advantages, ships will not achieve zero CO2 emissions with LNG alone since it is still a fossil fuel, posing the additional challenge of CH4 slip. Another challenge with LNG has been limited bunkering infrastructure and higher CAPEX requirements. LPG is one possible alternative to LNG. Methanol and ethanol, on the other hand, present other alternatives to LNG, with similar profiles to LPG. As drop-in fuels, methanol and ethanol are easier to handle in comparison to LNG, and benefit from a well-developed global terminal network. Alternative fuels for moving towards carbon neutrality, biofuel, synthetic methane, synthetic natural gas, and biomethane, are being considered. Meanwhile, H2 and NH3 are being considered for a carbon-free future.

JO  - Environmental Science \& Technology
PY  - 2014
VL  - 48
IS  - 16
AB  - The influence of ocean acidification in deep-sea ecosystems is poorly understood but is expected to be large because of the presumed low tolerance of deep-sea taxa to environmental change. We used a newly developed deep-sea free ocean CO2 enrichment (dp-FOCE) system(1) to evaluate the potential consequences of future ocean acidification on the feeding behavior of a deep-sea echinoid, the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus fragilis. The dp-FOCE system simulated future ocean acidification inside an experimental enclosure where observations of feeding behavior were performed. We measured the average movement (speed) of urchins as well as the time required (foraging time) for S. fragilis to approach its preferred food (giant kelp) in the dp-FOCE chamber (-0.46 pH units) and a control chamber (ambient pH). Measurements were performed during each of 4 trials (days -2, 2, 24, 27 after CO2 injection) during the month-long period when groups of urchins were continuously exposed to low pH or control conditions. Although urchin speed did not vary significantly in relation to pH or time exposed, foraging time was significantly longer for urchins in the low-pH treatment. This first deep-sea FOCE experiment demonstrated the utility of the FOCE system approach and suggests that the chemosensory behavior of a deep-sea urchin may be impaired by ocean acidification.

AB  - Royal Dutch Shell and HR Biopetroleum companies jointly prepare for the construction of a pilot plant in Hawaii that will cultivate marine algae to produce vegetable oils and bio-fuels. Their joint effort is called Cellana. This is another stage in the effort of the Shell company to develop a new generation of bio-fuels from sustainable non-foodstuff raw materials. The algae are promising because they grow fast, are rich in vegetable oils, and can be cultivated in basins of sea water, reducing to a minimum the use of fertile earth and fresh water. Shell is the majority shareholder of Cellana. The site, on loan from the Natural Laboratory of the Hawaii Authority (NELHA) is near commercial companies that specialize in algae for the industry of nutrition and of pharmaceuticals. The algae will come from Hawaii or will be approved by the Hawaii Ministry of Agriculture. Once harvested, the vegetable oil in the algae will be extracted. The program will have recourse to counsel in science from the Universities of Hawaii, Southern Mississippi, and, in Nova Scotia, Dalhousie. Algae have the advantage of rapid growth. They can double their volume several times in one day and produce much more oil per acre than alternative vegetables such as rapeseed oil, palm oil, soya oil, or jatropha oil. Also, the facilities can be built along the coasts, thus not inconveniencing traditional agriculture. In the long term, the aquatic farms can absorb or capture the carbon dioxide emissions directly from industrial facilities such as power plants. The Cellana demonstration plant will use carbon dioxide stored in cylinders to explore this potential.

TI  - Towards defining reasonable minimum composition thresholds â€“ Impacts of variable CO2 stream compositions on transport, injection and storage

VL  - 114
IS  - NA
AB  - To set up recommendations on how to define â€œreasonable minimum composition thresholdsâ€ for CO2 streams to access CO2 pipeline networks, we investigated potential impacts of CO2 streams with different and temporally variable compositions and mass flow rates along the CCS chain. All investigations were based on a generic â€œCCS cluster scenarioâ€ in which CO2 streams captured from a spatial cluster of eleven emitters (seven fossil-fired power plants, two cement plants, one refinery and one steel mill) are collected in a regional pipeline network. The resulting CO2 stream (19.78 Mio t impure CO2 per year) is transported in a trunk line (onshore and offshore) and injected into five generic replicate storage structures (Buntsandstein saline aquifers) offshore. Experimental investigations and modeling of selected impacts revealed beneficial as well as adverse impacts of different impurities and their combinations. Overall, no fundamental technical obstacles for transporting, injecting and storing CO2 streams of the considered variable compositions and mass flow rates were observed. We recommend to define minimum composition thresholds for each specific CCS project through limiting i) the overall CO2 content, ii) maximum contents of relevant impurities or elements, iii) acceptable variability of concentrations of critical impurities, and defining impurity combinations to be avoided.

JO  - Advanced Functional Materials
PY  - 2022

AB  - Harvesting wave energy is challenging due to the waves' direction, randomization, and ultra-low vibration frequency limitations. Here, a double-sided fluff and double Halbach array structured hybrid triboelectric-electromagnetic nanogenerator (FH-HG) for harvesting ultra-low frequency wave energy is reported. The double-sided fluff fabricates three triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), which significantly enhance space utilization and volume power density. Meanwhile, the double Halbach array electromagnetic generator (H-EMG) provides the optimum counterweight in the double-sided fluff TENG (F-TENG) and transforms the mechanical energy into electrical energy. The optimal linkages of TENGs and EMGs are both specified as parallel, according to a series of theoretical analyses and experimental comparisons. As the result, the maximum volume power density of F-TENG and H-EMG is achieved at 2.02 and 16.96 W m(-3), respectively. The design of the double-sided fluff and the double Halbach array ensures the device's superior output at low frequencies while also increasing its endurance. Furthermore, the outputs of the FH-HG can power some small electronic devices and the Bluetooth transmission system to achieve the purpose of real time marine environmental monitoring. Overall, benefiting from the excellent structural design and distinctive operational mechanism, the FH-HG provides a remarkable candidate for harvesting wave energy on a large scale.

TI  - Analytical estimates of the energy yield potential from the Alderney Race (Channel Islands) using marine current energy converters
JO  - Renewable Energy
PY  - 2004
VL  - 29
IS  - 12
AB  - Energy from marine currents offers the promise of regular and predictable electrical generation at higher power densities than other renewables. The marine current resource is potentially large but mainly concentrated in a number of sites around the world. The power density for a horizontal axis turbine operating in such currents has a similar form to that of a wind turbine and is dependent on the cube of the velocity and the fluid density which for water is about 1000 times that of air. These two factors imply that the power density for marine current energy converters will be appreciably higher than that of wind generators resulting in smaller and hence more manageable size turbines. In the UK, for example, tidal races which exist in the waters around the Channel Islands and the 'Sounds' off the Scottish west coast are well known. The energy density at such sites is high due land mass constrictions which result in large current velocities at depths which are suitable for the installation of multiple arrays of turbines. This study was undertaken for the purpose of quantifying the potential of generating electricity from the Alderney Race in the Channel Islands. The work quantifies the resource, identifies fluid currents that could be used for the establishment of various size arrays in the race and constructs some logical course of action and direction for the installation of marine current turbines in arrays in the Race. The analytically predicted results for the selected site of the Alderney race showed that such installations can realise energy yields in excess of 7.4 TWh which is equivalent to 2% of the UK requirements for the year 2000. However, despite the totally predictable resource the energy yield of the site followed an uneven power production which could be used in a planned mixed power production structure. The analysis, although based on data from Admiralty Charts, has shown that there is a large potential for energy generation from such sites. Furthermore, and by virtue of the topography of the site, it is feasible to envisage a modular approach to the installation of size-dependent marine energy conversion devices or turbines to be deployed in phases taking into account technology progression and developments.

TI  - Coordinated Converter Control Strategy in Hybrid AC/DC Power Systems for System Frequency Support
JO  - Energy Procedia
PY  - 2016
VL  - 94
IS  - NA
AB  - This paper proposes a coordinated converter control strategy for multi-terminal dc (MTDC) grids in hybrid AC/DC power systems. Previous works have shown the possibility of providing frequency containment reserve (FCR) from offshore wind farms to ac grids through MTDC grids using frequency and dc voltage droop control. However, due to the characteristics of dc voltage droop control, the frequency support would come both from offshore wind farms and all other ac grids connected to the MTDC. This paper proposes a coordinated MTDC converter control strategy that maximizes the share of the FCR contribution from an offshore wind farm and reduces the contribution of other ac grids. A hybrid AC/DC power system consisting of offshore wind farm and two asynchronous grids connected through an MTDC grid is used as a test system. Using the test system, different scenarios are analyzed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed coordinated control strategy. Â© 2016 The Authors.

International Maritime Organization (IMO) has adopted universal measures that made shipping the first industrial sector to have binding global regime in place to reduce its CO2 emissions. Within the context of IMO's EEDI (Energy Efficiency Design Index), it was agreed that vessels constructed after 2025 will be 30 percent more efficient than those built in 2000. Developments of new propellers, the shape of the hull, antifouling technologies, all contribute to vessels having less emissions per ton kilometer.

JO  - NANA

IS  - NA
AB  - CCS presents the opportunity to utilise Australia's coal and gas resources in an emissions constrained world. Through this study, we have undertaken the most comprehensive assessment to date of the practical equipment costs associated with transporting and storing CO2 captured from power plants in Australia. The implementation of CCS in Australia will require a large transport and storage network involving pipelines, booster pumps, wells, storage site facilities and storage site monitoring. Such a network does not currently exist and needs to be built if CCS is to be deployed at scale. Excluding initial compression, the total plant costs for transport and storage of CO2 from power plant emission hubs in Australia are estimated to vary from as little as \$5-14/t injected for cases with short transport distance and good quality storage sites up to about \$60/t injected for transport of large volumes of CO2 over long distances to lower quality sites. These costs should not be confused with total project costs that include additional owner's costs of at least 15-40\% for proving up storage sites, undertaking the required front end engineering and obtaining project approvals. The total project costs may also require extra risk-adjusted costs. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Several vessel owners and managers are considering alternative fuels, such as biodiesel and innovative crankcase systems, to comply with environmental regulations. The use of alternative fuels and innovative crankcase systems are also helping vessel owners and managers, to overcome the challenges of increased operating costs. A nee generation of fuel filtration systems have been developed specifically for these applications. The technology enables vessel operators in reducing the environmental impact of marine diesels, while maintaining optimum performance levels. It has been observed that filtering biofuels derived from vegetable oils or biomass offer an effective carbon neutral alternative to conventional diesel. Biofuels can also have a significant adverse effect on the cold filter plugging point (CFPP) of fuel, leading to reduced engine performance and complete breakdown.

AB  - There are various candidate sites for tidal stream energy extraction in the English Channel. In this paper we examine the tidal stream resource at Portland Bill and the south coast of the Isle of Wight. A depth-averaged numerical model is developed and compared to field measurements. The presence of rows of tidal turbines is simulated using a line-discontinuity to represent the head loss across the turbines. The head loss is given by linear momentum actuator disc theory. At each site the length of the turbine rows, the local blockage ratio, and the location of the turbines are varied. For Portland Bill the presence of an array with multiple rows of turbines is also considered. We find that it is likely that (based purely on the hydrodynamics) power could viably be extracted at each site, with the mean power produced by each site being in the order of 10s MW

AB  - Carbon absorption and storage, known as carbon sequestration, have reduced global warming through photosynthesis. Seagrass beds in coastal ecosystems have high plant productivity and are found to have the ability to reduce the effect of global warming due to the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere. Due to the anthropogenic effect, decreasing environmental quality, such as tourism, may affect seagrass diversity and growth, therefore its carbon contents. This study investigates the ability of seagrass species as carbon storage and their diversity in a common tourist destination area referred to as disturbed habitat, located at Sanur and an area that is less disturbed, referred to as undisturbed habitat. Samples were collected from 3 transects 50m in length that were placed on each site. Three plots, each measuring 0.5 x 0.5 m, were employed on each transect. The number of individuals of each species and the percent plant coverage were measured on each plot. Plant biomass and carbon content were extracted in the Lab and divided into below- and above-ground. The result shows that eight species were found at Sanur and only four from Samuh sites. On average, the percentage of plant coverage was higher at the Samuh site. Samuh site. The plant biomass and carbon storage were lower at Samuh than at the Sanur site. Species differences from each site affect the plant biomass, so the carbon content. Anthropogenic activities are not the only ones to determine the carbon storage of seagrass, but rather the species morphology. Â© 2021. All Rights Reserved.

JO  - Fuel
PY  - 2016
VL  - 182
IS  - NA
AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) has gradually strengthened the laws regulating ship exhaust emissions. The majority of ships designed for international voyages and powered by large two-stroke marine diesel engines use heavy fuel oil (HFO), which has the advantage of a low price compared to other types of fuel. However, HFO generates large amounts of harmful exhaust emissions during combustion in a marine diesel engine. In addition, as fuel costs account for a large portion of the expenditure budgets of the shipping companies that operate and manage such ships, fuel cost reduction is of considerable interest to such companies. In this study, two fuel additives, oil-soluble Ca-based and oil-soluble Fe-based organometallic compounds, which can improve the performance of diesel engines, were injected into HFO at fixed concentrations (1/4000 and 1/6000 of the total fuel, respectively), in attempts to reduce fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. For enhanced experimental accuracy and reproducibility, a large two-stroke diesel engine installed in a land-based power plant was used as the test subject. Evaluative tests were conducted for three engine loads (50\%, 75\%, and 100\%). The engine performance (i.e., the fuel consumption rate, maximum combustion pressure, and exhaust gas temperature) and the exhaust emissions (NOx, particulate matter (PM)) were analyzed before and after the fuel additive insertion.

The development and utilization of low head and ultralow head hydraulic resources can increase the runner's energy parameters, make up for the defects of large size and low speed of the unit, and reduce the construction investment. The bulb tubular turbine's operation stability and structural strength are compared and analyzed by the orthogonal test method to improve the perfomance of bulb tubular turbine. The results show that the optimal design scheme can be obtained when the number of guide vane is 16, the distance between the guide vane and the blade is 1995 mm, the hub ratio is 0.31, the relative twist angle of the blade is 27 degrees, and the cascade density is 0.72. After optimization, the bulb tubular turbine's efficiency and output are increased by 5.72\% and 2.86\% at a low flow rate, respectively. The vortex at the tailpipe is reduced, and the blade work effect and the cavitation performance are well. The maximum pressure pulsation amplitude in the flow passage is reduced by 73.15\%, the maximum blade deformation is reduced by 39.59\%, and the maximum blade static stress is reduced by 13.16\%. Finally, the reliability of numerical simulation results is verified by the model test.

JO  - Energies
PY  - 2022
VL  - 15
IS  - 24
AB  - The increasing environmental concerns due to emissions from the shipping industry have accelerated the interest in developing sustainable energy sources and alternatives to traditional hydrocarbon fuel sources to reduce carbon emissions. Predominantly, a hybrid power system is used via a combination of alternative energy sources with hydrocarbon fuel due to the relatively small energy efficiency of the former as compared to the latter. For such a hybrid system to operate efficiently, the power management on the multiple power sources has to be optimised and the power requirements for different vessel types with varying loading operation profiles have to be understood. This can be achieved by using energy management systems (EMS) or power management systems (PMS) and control methods for hybrid marine power systems. This review paper focuses on the different EMSs and control strategies adopted to optimise power management as well as reduce fuel consumption and thus the carbon emission for hybrid vessel systems. This paper first presents the different commonly used hybrid propulsion systems, i.e., dieselâ€“mechanical, dieselâ€“electric, fully electric and other hybrid systems. Then, a comprehensive review of the different EMSs and control method strategies is carried out, followed by a comparison of the alternative energy sources to diesel power. Finally, the gaps, challenges and future works for hybrid systems are discussed. Â© 2022 by the authors.

JO  - Offshore Technology Conference Asia 2018, Otca 2018
PY  - 2018
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Hydrate formation in subsea flowlines is one of the main concerns to safely transport the hydrocarbon fluids in the field of flow assurance. To prevent blockage of hydrate, thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors (THIs) have been injected into the subsea flowlines; however, the high injection amount of THIs may drive up operational expenditure (OPEX) with increasing water depth of oil and gas reservoirs. Kinetic hydrate inhibitors (KHIs) have been investigated as an alternative for few decades. In this study, microcapsules were designed using microfluidics concept for efficient release of KHIs at off-shore transport line of hydrocarbon and gas. Hydrate formation kinetics among four different systems, pure water, microcapsules containing poly vinyl caprolactam (PVCap), microcapsules without PVCap, and PVCap aqueous solution was investigated. The dispersive Raman was applied to understand hydrate formation on microcapsules with temperature change under static condition, and autoclave study also was employed to confirm the shear rate effect on microcapsule stability. From the both experiments, it was confirmed that release of KHI solution from microcapsules delayed the formation of hydrate at the target temperature and showed a similar efficacy comparing to the bulk KHI solution under turbulent condition. These results indicated the release of PVCap solution can be controlled by adjusting the membrane thickness of the microcarriers, which would provide operational flexibility to manage the risk of hydrate plug formation.

AB  - Environmental issues and targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have reinforced attempts to increase energy efficiency for all stakeholders, including the shipping industry. International maritime organization (IMO) has prescribed operational and design measures to develop energy efficiency and decrease ship emissions, and one of the effective operational measures is trim optimization, which is a feasible measure because it does not necessitate ship structural modification or engine advancement, but it can reduce the ship resistance and decrease fuel consumption. The study of trim optimization can be implemented by conducting experimental tests, but it is a difficult, expensive method and consumed more time. Therefore, the present paper proposes a numerical method to predict the optimum trim which achieves the minimum ship resistance and lower fuel consumption. The current paper investigated two types of ships as a case study, bulk carrier, and container ship. The optimization process has studied several trim conditions, ship drafts, and speeds. The results showed that positive trim (trim by bow) have an increasing effect on fuel consumption, while the negative trim (trim by stern) have a decreasing effect on fuel consumption. Fuel-saving based on using optimum trim at each speed is a significant quantity to be benefited as it would reduce the operating costs and increase the energy efficiency.

PY  - 2013
VL  - 6
IS  - NA
AB  - Environmental restrictions now favor cleaner fuels, and Natural gas (LNG) is one of the most promising alternative fuels. Highly efficient natural gas fuelled engines have been developed since around 1990. These engines are now entering maritime applications, offering significant emission reductions, both in a local and global perspective. Using LNG as fuel reduce NOx emissions by up to 90%, SOx and particulate matter (soot) are reduced by 95-100% and CO 2 emissions are reduced by up to 25%, when compared to traditional marine fuels. These emission reductions are significant contribution especially in local and regional environments. Using LNG as a clean fuel also offers a significant increase in total energy efficiency. Combining power and heat generation, natural gas fuelled engines for on-shore power generation offer a total thermal efficiency of 80-90%, depending on the waste heat recovery rate. For liquid fuels exhaust heat recovery is limited due to the sulfur content, which may cause acid corrosion. Onboard ships, LNG fuelled engines have potential to utilize waste heat to obtain significant higher thermal efficiency than their diesel engine counterpart. LNG is mainly available from fossil sources, but now also increasingly from renewable sources as bio-gas. For storing and transportation LNG is preferred as less challenging compared to high pressure CNG. On the coast of Norway a LNG distribution system is now being built, supplying a fleet of more than 40 ships. LNG is transported by special designed small LNG carriers from the production plants to a series of main terminals along the coastline. From these main terminals the LNG is distributed by trucks to the local fuelling stations, or for direct fuelling of the ships. This paper will present the basic technology and experiences from this full scale LNG fuel system. The paper will discuss local and global environmental benefits, technical solutions, safety issues, and costs issues related to the distribution system and the on-board fuel installations.

Several economic parameters, as capital or O\&M costs, have been considered. In addition, a sensitivity analysis has been performed by varying the discount rate in three different scenarios. Several types of physical restrictions have been taken into account: bathymetry, submarine electrical cables, seabed geology, environmental conditions, protected areas in terms of heritage, navigation areas, seismic fault lines, etc. Spatial operations have been carried out to complete the procedure, using Model Builder of GIS software. Results indicate the most suitable areas in economic terms in Portugal to install wave energy devices. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

JO  - Ocean Engineering
PY  - 2020
VL  - 217

AB  - Efficient tidal turbine designs rely upon the hydrodynamic performance of the turbine blade sections. A significant consideration for the likely power generation capacity of a tidal turbine is the effect of biofouling on the blade performance. A turbine blade surface is susceptible to large scale macrofouling, mainly from encrusters, such as barnacles and molluscs, colonising the developing surface. This paper considers the case of when a barnacle attaches to the upper (suction) surface of the blade section. Results of experiments to investigate the unsteady flow characteristics of the blade section are presented, and the modification of the hydrodynamic performance coefficients due to the presence of a barnacle is evaluated. The barnacle has no significant effect upon the lift in steady flow and unsteady flow, but there is a very large increase in the drag. Dependent upon the degree of barnacle encrustation, the effect on a turbine blade drag may be significant and lead to a degradation of a turbine predicted performance. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

JO  - Proceedings Of The Annual Offshore Technology Conference
PY  - 2020
VL  - 2020-May
IS  - NA
AB  - Two major challenges in CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) are the high mobility of CO2 and reservoir heterogeneity. High CO2 mobility, related to the low density and viscosity of CO2, compared to in-situ fluids can cause viscous fingering, gravity override, and flow in thief zones resulting in poor reservoir sweep efficiency and low oil recoveries. Mobility control foam can improve CO2 EOR and CO2 storage potential by mitigating unfavorable CO2 properties and reducing the impact of reservoir heterogeneity. CO2 foam injection involves injecting a foaming agent (surfactant) with CO2 to generate stable foams in porous media. This work presents an incremental physical upscaling approach that moves from the pore-to core-to fieldscale for characterizing and optimizing foam systems for CO2 mobility control, EOR, and CO2 storage. An additional focus was to visualize and describe in-situ fluid saturation dynamics during CO2 storage processes. We address the challenges associated with transferring CO2 foam EOR technology offshore, using lessons learned from an ongoing onshore pilot in the Permian Basin of west Texas. The aim is to encourage co-optimized CO2 EOR and long-term CO2 storage foam technology as part of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) for offshore applications.

JO  - Energies
PY  - 2021
VL  - 14

AB  - One key directive to realize the global transition towards net-zero emission goals is to integrate more renewable energy resources into the generation mix. Due to higher and more consistent wind speeds, offshore wind farms (OWFs) have the potential to generate more energy at a steadier rate than their onshore counterpart. However, at the collection system level, all the OWFs use alternating current (AC) technology at present. Nonetheless, with an increasing capacity of the single wind turbine (WT) and larger distances to the shore, the use of direct current (DC) technology at the collection system level is beneficial. To select a suitable DC collection system topology, this paper proposes a comprehensive analytical reliability evaluation method, based on the Universal Generating Function technique, together with associated economic factors. Four candidates DC collection system options were evaluated with different WT capacities for a 400 MW OWF. The availability indices such as Generation Ratio Availability and Expected Energy Not Supplied were used to assess their reliability levels. The results show that the radial topology with a single platform DC/DC converter is more reliable and economical than the other candidate options.

TI  - Reforming International Fisheries Law Can Increase Blue Carbon Sequestration
JO  - Frontiers In Marine Science
PY  - 2022
VL  - 9
IS  - NA
AB  - The oceans are by far the largest carbon sink and are estimated to have absorbed roughly 40 percent of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions since the beginning of the industrial era. The climate services performed by the oceans can be described as an interaction between a physical and a biological carbon pump. Whereas the role of the physical carbon pump is well established, the full scale of the climate services provided by the biological carbon pump has only recently been understood. This pump is made up of services provided by different marine species, from microbes to marine mammals. Many of these species are managed under the international law of the sea and subject to the concept of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). Although the MSY concept has developed since its inception, maximum generation of fish for human consumption remains the core objective according to the law of the sea. Under MSY based management, states are not required to consider the climate services represented by different marine organisms, making this regime unable to balance the interest of maximizing fish as a product against the oceansâ€™ role in carbon sequestration. In order to make optimal use of the carbon sequestering features of marine organisms, this perspective proposes five action points. Foremost, MSY should be complemented with a new management objective: maximum carbon sequestration (MCS). Although many aspects of climate-based fisheries management remain to be explored, it appears clear that this would imply allowing stocks to recover to maintain a larger amount of biomass, increasing conservation measures for species particularly efficient in providing negative emissions, differentiation of fisheries within species as well as a new approach to ecosystem management. Climate reforming international fisheries law could make an important contribution to the operationalization of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, as well as the UN Sustainable Development Goals. As a first step, international guidelines should be developed on how to integrate the concept of maximum carbon sequestration in fisheries management.

AB  - The Washington State Department of Ecology conducted a large-scale ocean acidification (OA) study in greater Puget Sound to: (1) produce a marine carbon dioxide (CO2) system dataset capable of distinguishing between long-term anthropogenic changes and natural variability, (2) characterize how rivers and freshwater drive OA conditions in the region, and (3) understand the relative influence of cumulative anthropogenic forcing on regional OA conditions. Marine CO2 system data were collected monthly at 20 stations between October 2018 and February 2020. While additional data are still needed, the climate-level data collected thus far have uncovered novel insights into spatiotemporal distributions of and variability in the regional marine CO2 system, especially at low salinities in shallow, river-forced shelf regions. The data provide a strong foundation with which to continue monitoring OA conditions across the region. More importantly, this work represents the first successful long-term OA monitoring program undertaken at the state-level by a regulatory agency. Therefore, we offer the work described herein as a blueprint to help state and local scientists and environmental and natural resource managers develop, implement, and conduct long-term OA monitoring programs and studies in their own contexts and jurisdictions.

AB  - Carbon and nitrogen storage in exotic Halophila stipulacea were compared to that in native Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa meadows and adjacent unvegetated sediments of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea and to that in native H. stipulacea of the Red Sea at sites with different biogeochemical conditions and level of human pressure. Exotic H. stipulacea possessed considerable storing capacity, with 2-fold higher Corg stock (0.71 Â± 0.05 kg mâˆ’2 in the top 20 cm of sediment) and burial (14.78 gCorg mâˆ’2 yâˆ’1) than unvegetated areas and C. nodosa meadows and, surprisingly, comparable to P. oceanica. N (0.07 Â± 0.01 kg mâˆ’2) and Cinorg (14.06 Â± 8.02 kg mâˆ’2) stocks were similar between H. stipulacea and C. nodosa or unvegetated sediments, but different to P. oceanica. Corg and N stocks were higher in exotic than native H. stipulacea populations. Based on isotopic mixing model, organic material trapped in H. stipulacea sediments was mostly allochthonous (seagrass detritus 17% vs seston 67%). Corg stock was similar between monospecific and invaded C. nodosa meadows by H. stipulacea. Higher stocks were measured in the higher human pressure site. H. stipulacea introduction may contribute in the increase of carbon sequestration in the Eastern Mediterranean. Â© 2019, The Author(s).

JO  - Environmental Science And Technology
PY  - 2013
VL  - 47
IS  - 19
AB  - Autonomous in situ sensors are needed to document the effects of today's rapid ocean uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide (e.g., ocean acidification). General environmental conditions (e.g., biofouling, turbidity) and carbon-specific conditions (e.g., wide diel variations) present significant challenges to acquiring long-term measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) with satisfactory accuracy and resolution. SEAS-DIC is a new in situ instrument designed to provide calibrated, high-frequency, long-term measurements of DIC in marine and fresh waters. Sample water is first acidified to convert all DIC to carbon dioxide (CO2). The sample and a known reagent solution are then equilibrated across a gas-permeable membrane. Spectrophotometric measurement of reagent pH can thereby determine the sample DIC over a wide dynamic range, with inherent calibration provided by the pH indicator's molecular characteristics. Field trials indicate that SEAS-DIC performs well in biofouling and turbid waters, with a DIC accuracy and precision of âˆ¼2 Î¼mol kg-1 and a measurement rate of approximately once per minute. The acidic reagent protects the sensor cell from biofouling, and the gas-permeable membrane excludes particulates from the optical path. This instrument, the first spectrophotometric system capable of automated in situ DIC measurements, positions DIC to become a key parameter for in situ CO 2-system characterizations.

AB  - Mooring systems are a significant capital cost of a floating wave energy converter and their premature failure negatively impacts operational costs. Excessive peak loads and accumulated fatigue damage can lead to failure, so these factors are cost drivers in wave energy converter design. Here, the potential to reduce platform motion and mooring loads through modification of the power take-off (PTO) control are investigated. An approximate velocity tracking control strategy is implemented with a linear quadratic regulator design method using differential weighting of system states. It is demonstrated that the controller can be tuned to capture similar mean power to an optimally tuned, passively damped system while significantly reducing mooring line cyclic loading. The relative accumulated fatigue damage in the mooring lines in a high energy sea-state is found to be reduced by between 43% and 92% as a result of using the approximate velocity tracking control strategy.

TI  - Assessment of collection systems for HVDC connected offshore wind farms
JO  - Electric Power Systems Research
PY  - 2015
VL  - 129
IS  - NA
AB  - Abstract A technical and economic comparison is made between DC and AC collection systems of offshore wind farms. DC collection systems have the advantages of reduced weight and size of the DC cables and DC cables are free from reactive power compensation. The heavy 50/60 Hz transformers in the offshore transmission platform of AC collection systems can be replaced with smaller size medium frequency transformers in DC collection systems. However, the need for a high power DC-DC converter with high voltage transformation ratios and DC protection methods will remain a challenge for the DC collection systems. Also, DC collection systems do not necessarily reduce the power conversion stages compared to the AC collection systems even if HVDC (High Voltage DC) transmission is used to transfer the offshore wind power from the collection systems to the onshore grids. A cost assessment study verifies that the cost reductions achieved by the reduced size of the DC cables and offshore platform are outweighed by the cost of DC protective devices and DC-DC converters. This is because the length of the DC collection cables is relatively short compared to the long distance HVDC cables. The technical comparison supported by the simulation results shows that the total losses in the DC collection systems are higher than in AC collection systems. The effect of collection bus voltages on the losses is analysed for the DC collection systems. Â© 2015 The Authors.

TI  - Increasing Arctic Sea Ice Albedo Using Localized Reversible Geoengineering
JO  - Earths Future
PY  - 2018
VL  - 6
IS  - 6
AB  - The rising costs of climate change merit serious evaluation of potential climate restoration solutions. The highest rate of change in climate is observed in the Arctic where the summer ice is diminishing at an accelerated rate. The loss of Arctic sea ice increases radiative forcing and contributes to global warming. Restoring reflectivity of Arctic ice could be a powerful lever to help in the effort to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C. Polar ice restoration should be considered in planning of 1.5 degrees C pathways. In this paper, a novel localized surface albedo modification technique is presented that shows promise as a method to increase multiyear ice using reflective floating materials, chosen so as to have low subsidiary environmental impact. Detailed climate modeling studying the climate impact of such a method reveals more than 1.5 degrees C cooler temperatures over a large part of the Arctic when simulating global sea ice albedo modification. In a region north of Barents and Kara Seas temperatures have been reduced by 3 degrees C and in North Canada by almost 1 degrees C. Additionally, there are notable increases in sea ice thickness (20-50 cm Arctic wide) and ice concentration (>15-20\% across large parts of central Arctic). These results suggest that the geoengineering technology proposed in this study may be a viable instrument for restoring Arctic ice. Plain Language Summary This paper describes a method to preserve and restore ice in the Arctic in order to reduce the effects of climate change. This method is benign by design, developed to restore ice in the Arctic in targeted areas to build back the reflective ice that has melted over the past several decades. The aim is to restore the Arctic ice's historic function of reflecting sunlight. By applying reflective materials such as glass microspheres on young, low-reflectivity sea ice, we can protect the young ice from the summer Sun, much like a white shirt fends off the Sun for a person on a hot summer day. This way the ice may be conserved and converted over time into highly reflective multiyear sea ice. Climate modeling shows that this method can cool the Arctic significantly and can rebuild Arctic ice area and volume, hence reducing Arctic as well as global temperature rise.

AB  - Described was an alongshore wave energy power generation device, of which the special dual-channel structure could convert the flow of sea water in dual directions into the rotation of the impeller in a single direction. A two-dimensional numerical calculation of the structure of the dual-channel was performed by utilizing the MRF (moving reference frame) model in the software Fluent 6.3. The velocity and pressure distribution of the fluid inside the channel were analyzed when the number of blades was 4 and the fluid turned various angles. The water flow rate through the power generation equipment item and its output power were also studied. Furthermore, the influence of the angle that the blades on the impeller turn on the utilization efficiency of the wave energy was investigated. The calculation results show that when the turning angle of the impeller is relatively small, the pressure difference between any two zones of the impeller is conspicuous, thus the flow rate passing through the equipment item is relatively small. With an increase of the turning angle of the impeller, the pressure difference between any two zones of the impeller will first decrease and then increase. Corresponding with this, the flow rate passing through and the output power of the equipment item will first increase and then decrease gradually.

VL  - NA

AB  - This paper presents the control strategy of a dc series offshore wind farm with an onshore modular multilevel converter (MMC). The series connection of the dc wind turbines establishes the HVDC transmission voltage level with neither offshore transformer nor centralized converter station, indicating huge savings on offshore wind farm investment. However, power production unbalance in the wind farm or bypass of any wind turbine may impose overvoltage at the outputs of several wind turbines. A global control strategy, which regulates the HVDC voltage level by controlling the onshore MMC, is thus proposed to ensure the operation of each wind turbine under a safe voltage level while no power production is lost in the wind farm. This paper first introduces the whole wind generation system. Then the steady state analysis of the dc series offshore wind farm and the overvoltage phenomenon are described, which lead to the proposal of the global control strategy. The detailed realization of the global control strategy by use of the MMC is given after a short recall of the MMC arm average model. Â© 2016 IEEE.

AB  - There is growing pressure to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from maritime transportation. One of the most effective strategies for reducing GHG emissions is to switch from conventional fuels such as heavy fuel oil to alternative fuels. Green hydrogen is a promising alternative for the shipping industry. Nonetheless, its potential usage will depend on more than its environmental friendliness. Economic, technical, and safety factors must be assessed. This paper provides a critical assessment of the potential usage of green hydrogen in the shipping industry with an evaluation of production routes, techno-economic performance, storage, and safety. Benchmarking is also carried out compared to existing â€˜greyâ€™ and â€˜blueâ€™ production routes specific to shipping industry applications. Important metrics for liquid hydrogen are analyzed to evaluate production cost and GHG emissions for various routes. Furthermore, a comparison is made for the safety and health issues of hydrogen compared to conventional and emerging maritime shipping fuels. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Plant biomass resources have been gradually used to restore and improve saline soils. However, little is known about whether the applications of reed straw (PA) and biochar (BC) in degraded coastal salt marshes are beneficial for blue carbon sink enhancement and carbon drawdown. Here, we evaluated the effects of 3\% PA and 3\% BC applications on the vegetation, soil and blue carbon sink function of degraded salt marsh ecosystems and assessed their CO2 reduction capacities based on the life cycle. The results showed that the applications of PA and BC improved the soil quality of degraded salt marshes. Suaeda salsa recovered after 3\% PA and 3\% BC additions, and its carbon sequestration increased by 133\% and 12\%, respectively. The carbon pool of the degraded salt marshes was elevated by 0.4\%-2.8\% compared with that before restoration. The structural equation modelling indicated that both PA and BC application decreased soil electrical conductivity, while promoted the recovery of the plant carbon pool and an increase in the soil carbon pool. We calculated a CO2 drawdown of 137 kg center dot t(-1) for the 3\% PA addition in comparison with a CO2 emission of 175 kg center dot t(-1) for the 3\% BC addition based on a life cycle assessment. These findings indicate that PA and BC can be effectively used to restore degraded salt marshes and enhance blue carbon sinks while PA application is a better choice for degraded coastal wetlands rehabilitation to achieve carbon drawdown from a life cycle perspective.

AB  - W3G Marine (W3GM) based in Aberdeen, Scotland, and the Dutch shipbuilder IHC Merwede collaborated on the development of W3GM's patented design for an offshore wind turbine installation ship (OWTIS). The OWTIS concept has major advantages over existing assets, not least in its ability to improve offshore safety by necessitating fewer tasks to be performed offshore. It is environmentally friendly and able to operate in harsh weather and deploy large loads. The OWTIS concept is not limited by water depth and is readily transferable to the oil and gas heavy-lift market. The purpose-designed OWTIS will be equipped with a unique 1500-ton crane which, when used in conjunction with the patented lift system, will enable fully assembled wind turbines to be installed in one lift onto pre-installed foundations. This new industry-changing vessel will reduce the cost of installing offshore wind turbines by at least one third compared to current methods. IHC Merwede and W3GM expect that OWTIS will be the first of a series of vessels to enable the burgeoning offshore wind industry to meet the economic targets for round three of offshore wind farm development in the UK and other similar projects in Europe.

AB  - Understanding the kinetics of carbon dioxide (CO2) hydrate formation in pure water, seawater and porous media aids in developing technologies for CO2 gas storage, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and potentially for methane production from methane hydrates. The present work is focused on understanding the kinetics of CO2 hydrate formation in pure water and seawater at an initial formation pressure of 6 MPa (providing a driving force of about 4.0 MPa) and a formation temperature of 276.15 K with 75\% water saturation in three silica sand particle sizes (0.16 mm, 0.46 mm and 0.92 mm). The seawater (3.3 wt\% salinity) used in the present study is obtained from sea coast of Chennai (India). It is observed that the gas consumption of CO2 in hydrate is more for smaller silica sand particle and decreases as the size of the sand increases. The total gas consumed at the end of the seawater experiment is found to be less than the gas consumed at the end of the pure water experiment. This is due to the fact that salts in seawater act as a thermodynamic inhibitor resulting in lower gas consumption of CO2 in hydrate. The average rate of hydrate formation observed is optimum in 0.46 mm particles and is observed to be higher as compared to 0.16 and 0.92 mm particles over 10 h experimental time. This indicates that 0.46 mm silica sand provides an optimum environment for efficient hydrate formation. The study can be useful to understand the suitability of potential sandstone reservoir for CO2 sequestration in the form of hydrate in the presence of saline formation water. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the world approximately 90\% of freight is provided by maritime transport. Sea vessels provide a relatively large amount of total emissions in the world {[}1]. Nowadays marine pollution, especially air emissions from passenger ships berthing close to the city centers is an important factor making impact to the cities air quality. This problem can be partially solved by the ship's shore power system. This system will also reduce the vessel's fuel consumption, equipment maintenance and crew costs.

AB  - IMO's own International Shipping Facts and Figures report 2012 stated the number of vessels across the globe of 100 Gross Tonnage and over was 104,304, with cargo carrying vessels being 55,138 and expressed concern about the exponential increase of CO2, NO2, CH4 and so forth in recent year. The EU responded by setting targets. The EU 2050 objectives set some intermediate targets for Eco-Efficient Vessel Emission Reduction for key pollutants: CO2: >80% (-30% by 2020), NOx: 100% (-80% by 2020), SOx: 100% (-80% by 2020) and Noise Reduction: -3dB. A review of current research (Ziarati et al, 2018) clearly shows that the targets set for 2020 by both IMO and EU were not achieved and the 2050 goals are also unlikely to be achieved. The Industry is taking steps to reduce its air pollution and carbon footprint due to recent and upcoming IMO and EU regulations; IMO GHG study, Buhang et al (2009) reports that IMO has introduced some limits but has been unable to monitor ship emissions. EMSA has tried the use of satellites and drones to monitor ships, which pollute the sea but has been unable to monitor ship emissions and waste discharge at sea effectively due to technical difficulties and also vastness of the oceans. As the regulations and technologies governing energy efficiency on board ships becomes more complex it is realised by both the IMO and the shipping industry that seafarers need specific training to a much higher level in these fields. There needs to be a position specifically for managing, checking and controlling a shipâ€™s emissions for gases that are harmful to human health and the environment, an "Emissions Manager". As this is a brand new position, there are neither defined competences for this role nor any specific knowledge, understanding or proficiency for it. The paper gives full account of IMO efforts in recent years in setting legislation for key pollutants and reports on a new job specification for the Emissions Manager and proposes that an e-course being developed by several EU member states for the training of key ship officers and crew on how to minimise and monitor harmful emissions. The corresponding programme concerned with the current practice of managing emissions as well as the principle of making ships energy efficient. The new training programme targets both current cadets and existing seafarers in order to complement their skills.

AB  - Integrated power system combines electrical power for both ship service and electric propulsion loads by forming a microgrid. In this article, a battery/flywheel hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is studied to mitigate load fluctuations in a shipboard microgrid. This article focuses on how to determine the reference operation state of the flywheel, which depends on both future power load and the power split between the battery and flywheel. Two control strategies are proposedx2014;an optimization-based approach and a lookup-table-based approach. Case studies are performed in different sea conditions, and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control strategies outperform baseline control strategies in terms of power fluctuation mitigation and HESS power-loss reduction. A comparison between the two proposed approaches is performed, where their performances are quantified, the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy are analyzed, and the cases where they are most applicable are highlighted.

AB  - While regulations are being strengthened to prevent air pollution from ships in Korea and other countries, the Korean government has passed the Eco-Friendly Ship Act, which is effective from 1 January 2020. Therefore, for coastal ships constructed in Korea, the emission of air pollutants should be reduced by alternative fuel and improving their propulsion system. Accordingly, the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries in Korea has announced a plan to promote the conversion of all 140 government ships into eco-friendly ships using liquefied natural gas or electric propulsion systems by 2030. To apply these propulsion systems, rules, and regulations of the Korea government must first be reorganized. In this study, the type and development trend of electric propulsion systems are reviewed, and trends in regulations for installing electric propulsion systems on ships in various countries, including the United States and Europe, and institutions, including the IEC, IEEE, and International Maritime Organization, are analyzed. Finally, the standardization of the regulation system is discussed to facilitate the introduction of eco-friendly ships to Korea, and relevant implications will be presented. Â© 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Operations and maintenance issues in the offshore wind energy sector An explorative study
JO  - International Journal Of Energy Sector Management
PY  - 2016
VL  - 10
IS  - 2, SI
AB  - Purpose - There is increasing research interest in the expansion of the offshore wind energy sector. Recent research shows that operations and maintenance (O\&M) account for around 20-35 per cent of the total energy costs in this sector. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of O\&M issues in the offshore wind energy sector to propose initiatives that can help reduce the cost of energy used by offshore wind farms. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on an in-depth literature review and a Delphi study of a panel of 16 experts on O\&M. Findings - Consisting primarily of conceptual papers and/or modelling papers, the extant literature identifies several challenges for O\&M in the offshore wind energy sector. These challenges can be grouped into four categories: issues related with industry immatureness; distance/water depth; weather window; and policy issues. The Delphi study identified three other major issues that lead to increased O\&M costs: too many predefined rules that limit development; lack of coordinated planning of the different services offered at the wind farms; and lack of a common approach on how O\&M should be managed strategically. Research limitations/implications - The present study is based only on Danish respondents. Future research needs to include various respondents from different countries to identify country-specific contingencies. Practical implications - The paper provides an overview of the O\&M issues in the offshore wind energy sector to prioritize where future resources should be invested and, thus, reduce O\&M costs. Originality/value - This is the first paper on O\&M issues that bridges both literature studies and industry expert opinions.

AB  - Experiments with both uni- and multidirectional wave realizations with a stiff pile subjected to extreme wave forces are considered. Differences in crest heights and force peaks resulting from directional spread waves are analysed. The wave realizations are reproduced numerically in the fully nonlinear wave model OceanWave3D. The numerical reproductions compare well to the experiments. Only for the largest forces significant differences are seen, which is due to a very simple breaking filter applied in OceanWave3D. In the wave spectra, the higher harmonics occur for smaller frequencies than the straight multiples of the peak frequency. Further, the higher harmonics of the multidirectional wave spectra contain less energy. Both effects can be explained by the second order wave theory. Finally, the computed wave kinematics are used to investigate the dynamic response of an offshore wind turbine. The excitation of the first natural frequency is largest for the unidirectional wave realizations, as the higher harmonics are largest for these realizations. Â© 2017 ASME.

JO  - Publications On Ocean Development
PY  - 2019

IS  - NA
AB  - When contemplating planning and governance of human development it is perhaps typical to focus attention on the land. However, as this volume demonstrates it is also important to remember that the sea covers more than two thirds of our planetâ€™s surface and provides a wide range of essential goods and services upon which humans, and ultimately all life on Earth, depend. Indeed, land-sea interactions (LSI) have been significant in shaping patterns of human activity on both land and sea since ancient times. For example, humans have always looked to the sea for food, transport and trade, waste disposal and cultural and spiritual fulfilment, and coastal areas have been favoured places for human settlement. Today 16 of the worldâ€™s 23 mega cities (with populations exceeding 10 million) are in coastal locations1 and with the prospect of the global population rising from 7.6 billion in 2017 to over 11 billion by 21002 ongoing urbanisation of coastal areas can be anticipated. Beyond general trends of globalisation and the importance of international connectivity, one of the factors driving contemporary coastal and marine development is that the sea is increasingly being seen as a source of new â€˜Blue Growthâ€™ opportunities. Established maritime sectors, such as shipping and offshore oil and gas production, are now frequently accompanied by a range of other offshore uses, such as aquaculture and wind power developments. Technological advances are also opening new business possibilities in sectors such as blue biotechnology, ocean renewable energy and marine mineral extraction3. Alongside these very tangible human interactions with the marine environment, modern science is revealing the reality of less tangible, but in many ways more profound dependencies on the sea, including the vital role it plays in climate regulation and carbon capture. Equally, it is enhancing our understanding of the intricate web of connections between human activity - both land and sea based - and the health of the marine environment. Â© Sue Kidd, 2019

AB  - The call for concerted global action against the climate change impact is well heard. 191 countries would communicate their progressive plans through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as signatories to the Paris Agreement. Harbour crafts as part of the larger maritime ecosystem, can significantly contribute to reduced emissions. In this paper, HyForce, the next generation 2 MW hydrogen powered virtual tugboat was designed for a feasibility assessment for her techno-economic and environmental footprint to replace existing diesel-powered tugboats. The study compares the use of hydrogen fuel cells and an internal combustion engine to perform the same dynamic load profile for a typical tugboat mission. The results from the study show that a signpost for commercial competitiveness of HyForce is influenced primarily by the projected liquid hydrogen cost of 5.10 USD per kg in 2040 with a 2,000 USD/kW capital cost for the fuel cells. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from a â€œwell-to-wakeâ€ analysis for fossil-based hydrogen and renewable hydrogen supply chains were conducted, and the results show 26.9% and 75.6% reduction, respectively, compared to similar tug running on diesel fuel.

GloMEEP has the purpose of fostering a reduction in the emissions through the adoption and implementation of energy efficiency measures. With the aim of providing a tool for costs and benefits analysis of these energy efficiency measures, DNV GL developed an interactive spreadsheet for IMO. The tool is meant to provide an assessment of the impact of the various possible energy efficiency measures. It computes the effects of these technical operational measures on both the EEDI and the EEOI, and also the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve. In the present paper, use, results and potential of the model have been exploited by using input data derived from the specific segment of cruise vessels. Â© 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

A novel single-buoy heaving device called wave energy converter (WEC) based on hydrostatic transmission (HST), or can be shortened as HSTWEC, is proposed to convert mechanical energy generated by ocean waves into electric energy. Modeling and simulations with both regular and irregular waves were then carried out to investigate working performances of the designed HSTWEC. The results showed that more than 78% of wave energy can be absorbed. In addition, an adaptive controller was designed to improve the performance of the suggested device. Effectiveness of the overall HSTWEC control system was finally proved by simulations. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In response to global sulfur emission restrictions, China has established sulfur emission control areas in its coastal areas. This has a huge impact on China's coastal shipping ships. These ships can adopt the following three sulfur abatement options to deal with it: (1) using low-sulfur fuel, (2) using an exhaust gas cleaning system, and (3) using alternative fuel Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). This paper has established two models from two different perspectives to analyze the differences of abatement options between the shipowners and the general public. Sensitivity analyses are carried out on the factors affecting the sulfur abatement options, including remaining lifespan of ships, ship power, initial cost of sulfur abatement options, and fluctuations in the price of fuel. By analyzing the impact of these factors on the choice of the shipowners to reduce sulfur emission, this paper proposes some incentives and subsidy policies accordingly, which can provide references for policymakers.

Seven different operational modes with different loading profiles have been introduced for the vessel. The ship uses an LVDC distribution system to share power among sources, and distribute power among different loads. To simulate this hybrid electric power system, a nonlinear programming method is used to identify the optimal power sharing criteria between generators and the energy storage. The control strategy is based on the diesel generators loading level, which is implemented in MATLABÂ®. A comparison is made by counter posing the simulation results of the ship power system, before and after using the energy storage. The simulation results show improved fuel consumption in the hybrid electric system for all operational modes, particularly for dynamic positioning and harbor modes. Â© 2012 IEEE.

AB  - The maritime industry has great potential for improving energy efficiency in both new builds and existing ships. It is, therefore, necessary to identify the areas where improvements can be made to reduce fuel consumption, and influence to the shipowners, shipyards and designers of ships on the need to implement these improvements in energetic efficiency and to achieve a reduction of between 25% and 75% of CO2 emissions as IMO report 2009 provides, making ships even more environmentally friendly. The study was conducted focusing on one type of ship such as containership, compiling a database of these ships built from 2000 to 2014. The 3618 ships comprising the study were taken from the database of Lloyd's Register of Shipping. With all the technical data on each of the ships, we proceeded to relate the main and auxiliary power, with the operating speed of the vessel, its displacement and GT, by size, age and generation ships. All the above comparisons were made according to ship sizes, graphically and analytically in which interesting conclusions could be drawn in the relevant dimensioning of the main and auxiliary engines, as well as the operation of the ship. Because of the current crisis some owners have already begun to change their size criteria of propulsion and auxiliary engines of these vessels, their management and operation as well as their speed. Another significant finding was the identification of some shipyards that build their ships with an oversize and exaggerated power of the main and auxiliary engines, regardless of the effect on increasing fuel consumption and impact on the environment. Finally, we have performed a comparative study of EEOI of these vessels by size and age to determine the environmental signature and their evolution. All this leads us to determine a set of measures to be applied, for example, power reduction or derating, etc. on existing ships and applied to new designs, thus reducing the propulsion and auxiliary power of these ships and collaborating to reduce greenhouse gases.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 209
IS  - NA
AB  - In this study, five decades of simulated wave climate in Northeast Asia were used to investigate the intra-annual variation and long-term change of wave energy potential. The results show that in general, the nearshore areas of the eastern Pacific side of Japan have the highest annual mean wave power while Japan and Taiwan function as natural barriers to prevent oceanic waves to propagate from the Pacific Ocean towards Korea and eastern China. The wave energy hotspots vary, seasonally mainly from the east of Japan during the spring to Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan during the autumn, with the highest values in nearshore areas reach around 40 kW/m in September. The results indicate that the intra-annual stability of wave energy resources is the lowest in the western coasts of Japan, whereas this area has contained the least change of wave energy during five decades. On the contrary, southern areas of Japan despite having higher monthly stability show the highest reduction of wave power in the long-term. Hence, a novel index was proposed and applied in nearshore areas in order to specify the most suitable areas for wave energy exploitation considering the sustainability of the resources in both short and long-term.

JO  - Technological Forecasting And Social Change
PY  - 2023
VL  - 187
IS  - NA
AB  - A decrease in energy resources has motivated nations around the world to shift their focus to low carbon energy transition through renewable sources of energy. Offshore wind farms have emerged as a viable resource due to their many advantages. Wind energy boasts a positive image globally but does possess certain challenges. With this consideration, this study examines the challenges and barriers involved in the implementation of offshore wind energy through multi criteria assessment. Beginning with an examination of the common barriers identified from current literature resources, this study then consults a focus group and analyzes the barriers through a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach known as DEMATEL. This study considers both technical and functional barriers and it offers a particular focus on the developing nation of India, because India's energy demands are significant. The role of employing an Indian context is primarily due to the significant decrease in non-renewable energy resources. Further, developing nations like India are often hampered by the challenges of initial installation of vital clean energy sources. Few existing studies offer empirical case studies for India. Our study finds that a lack of awareness is the most influential barrier, and if that barrier can be eradicated, offshore wind energy systems may contribute to easing India's energy burdens. Hence, this study assists offshore wind engineers in exploring the technology's barriers and limitations and in securing appropriate eradication strategies. Among five different challenge dimensions, this study finds governance (D1) is the key influential dimension and Lack of awareness (B4) is the most influential factor among 25 considered factors. With these results, this study bridges the gap between engineers and top-level management to explain the some of the core issues related to the implementation of offshore wind farms. Finally, this study presents useful insights considering future enhancements and recommendations for an effective implementation of offshore wind farms with the assistance of identified influential barriers for achieving effective low carbon energy alternatives.

TI  - The relationship between the development of global maritime fleets and GHG emission from shipping
JO  - Journal Of Environmental Management
PY  - 2019
VL  - 242
IS  - NA
AB  - International shipping currently accounts for about 3\% of total global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but would continue to rise as transport capacity expands. If the shipping industry aims at delivering its proportionate contribution to curbing global warming under the Paris agreement, the sector has to, inevitably, promote energy conservation and emission reduction. A rapidly growing oceangoing fleet size and correspondingly rising GHG emissions on a global scale raise an interesting research question: could a certain relationship between the two be characterized as a function so that further emissions can be forecast based on the model? The paper adopts an allometric approach based on biological scaling laws to explore the potential relationship between the fleet size and corresponding GHG emissions from shipping. The results show that both the slowdown of the navigation speed and the current implementation of the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and Energy Efficiency Operation Index (EEOI) are effective on the whole. By employing the model, the development trends of GHG emissions from shipping in the future can be better understood. Through model applications and result analysis, numerical results validate the effectiveness of this method. The paper not only studies the development of GHG emissions from shipping in the past, but aslo evaluates its specific emission quantities in the future which is in line with the GHG emission reduction targets proposed by IMO on the 72nd IMO meeting, which will be helpful for policy decisions on the quota of GHG emissions to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and port administrators.

AB  - In recent years, most of countries have paid much attention on the energy saving, additive fuels and air pollution. Nowadays, LPG or CNG engines have been widely used on automobiles to meet the need of energy regulating and harmful emissions reducing. With the rapid development of transport and tour on waters, more and more boats and ships are used. Most of the propelling engines are diesels, and they give out a lot of smoke and harmful emissions to the air and the unburned oil in water. We have researched and developed a series of marine LPG engines which were used for propelling or generating electricity on boats to answer the request of environment protection in the field of rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs in China. We are now researching on gas engines that will be used as the power of LNG vessels, or the generating sets on land.

TI  - United Kingdom: Yorkshire fields could capture 6% of UK emissions
JO  - Chemical Engineer
PY  - 2008
VL  - NA
IS  - 805
AB  - According to Amec, the UK could reduce its CO2 emissions by over 6% by capturing and storing emissions from a handful of large industrial sites in the Yorkshire and Humber regions. Working on behalf of Yorkshire Forward, Amec has studied the infrastructure network needed to connect local industrial emitters to suitable CO2 storage sites in the North Sea. According to Amec's project director Alastair Rennie, this would cost around $3.95 billion, which would cover the infrastructure needed to compress and transport the gas, but not the cost of capturing the gas or the technology at the wellhead. The plan sees a number of companies developing the infrastructure in stages. The Yorkshire and Humber area is ideally suited as a first project of this kind, because it has both a relatively small number of large-scale CO2 emitters, including the Drax, Eggborough, and Ferrybridge, and a large number of mature gas fields nearby with a well-understood, stable geology, ideal for carbon storage. Many of these are expected to be depleted between 2012 and 2030. Amec's calculations assume that only 25% of the CO2 emitted in the area would ultimately be abated, that is the amount captured minus the emissions associated with the process of gas capture and transportation. Even so, the contribution would be very noticeable, amounting to around 35.6 million ton/yr by 2030, or 6.4% of the country's total CO2 emissions in 2005. At best, Rennie calculates that the Yorkshire and Humber region could abate 46.3 million ton/yr of carbon by 2040.

AB  - Interest in renewable energy in Iran has increased continually over the past decade. Iran has an excellent hydro power energy resource and the use of this resource will assist in the development of a sustainable energy future. Iran - with its many narrow channels and significant tidal range - might be expected to have considerable potential for tidal current power generation. The Khowr-e Musa Bay is a large coastal embayment on the south-western coast of Iran in which the peak tidal currents exceed 2 m/s. It is therefore a promising site for tidal stream power. The assessment employed a statistical method, for estimating tidal current energy resource at the selected site, during one lunar month (since 6 November 1996 to 7 December 1996). With the introduction of constraints and limitations, the technical, practical, accessible and viable tidal current energy resources were obtained. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Energy efficiency of integrated electric propulsion for ships â€“ A review
JO  - Renewable And Sustainable Energy Reviews
PY  - 2020
VL  - 134
IS  - NA
AB  - There has been mounting concerns over energy consumption and environmental impacts due to an increase in worldwide shipping activities. The International Maritime Organization has adopted regulations to impose limits on greenhouse gas emissions originated from fuel combustion of marine vessels. Such regulations are introduced in terms of energy efficiency design index and energy efficiency operational indicator. Extensive electrification of ship propulsion and shipboard power systems has been vastly proposed in the literature to make onboard energy systems more efficient. However, energy efficiency in the context of maritime transport is becoming even more stringent. Various technologies and operational practices therefore are being proposed to ensure full compliance with the tightening restrictions. The methods to increase energy efficiency and environmental performance of all-electric ships to satisfy such requirements involve integration of energy storage with a contribution of intelligent power management to optimize power split between various power generation sources; a tendency toward DC power distribution due to eliminating the need of all generators to be synchronized at a specific frequency; installation of unconventional propulsors for greater maneuverability requirements while keeping fuel consumption low; adoption of low carbon content fuel like liquefied natural gas for dual fuel diesel electric propulsion; establishment of onboard renewable energy systems for alternative clean power options; fuel cell integration in complementary operation with conventional diesel generators. This paper identifies promising technologies and practices that are applicable to onboard energy systems of all-electric ships and also reveals energy efficiency sensitivity of all-electric ships to different applications. The proposed strategies should be eventually combined with alternative technology-based and operational-based measures as implemented on conventional propulsion ships in order to realize full potential for energy efficient operation.

AB  - In order to comply with International Maritime Organization (IMO) gas emissions legislations and to cut fuel costs, ship owners are considering different options both in terms of utilization of different fuels and of introduction of energy recovery solutions. In the first part of the paper, an overview on emissions and fuel reduction technologies is presented. Among these, Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) using Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC) is receiving growing attention in particular, to recover low temperature waste heat in 2-stroke diesel engines. In order to assess the potential of the ORC utilization in terms of fuel saving, in this work, a preliminary thermodynamic analysis is presented. The analysis is based on a thermodynamic process simulation model of an ORC applied to a 2-stroke diesel engine implemented using Engineering Equation Solver (EES). The simulation model allows to analyse different type of engines and different waste heat recovery layouts. In this work, strategies for heat recovery in the cooling water circuits have been compared and different working fluids considered. Overall, the analysis allowed to identify the best waste heat recovery plat configuration both in terms of layout and working fluid. The preliminary thermodynamic analysis shows that recovering heat from the high temperature cooling water circuit allows a potential reduction in fuel consumption of 0.9-1%. Â© 2017 IMEKO

TI  - Strategies for the low sulfur policy of imoâ€”an example of a container vessel sailing through a european route
JO  - Journal Of Marine Science And Engineering
PY  - 2021
VL  - 9
IS  - 12
AB  - Ships are an important part in international trade transportation and a major source of pollution. Therefore, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) implemented an amendment to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) Annex VI, which stipulates that the sulfur content in marine fuel oil shall not exceed 0.5 wt.% starting in 2020. In order to meet the IMO low sulfur policy, shipping lines could adopt one of the following strategies: (1) using very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO), i.e., with sulfur content less than 0.5 wt.%; (2) installing scrubbers or other exhaust gas aftertreatment systems; or (3) replacing current fuels with clean alternative fuels such as natural gas. This study evaluates the feasibility and benefits of these strategies for shipping lines in order to determine the most cost-effective measures. First, according to the feasibility of the strategies evaluated by SWOT analysis, although scrubbers can reduce emissions of sulfur oxides into the atmosphere, more and more countries are restricting the discharge of wastewater from open-loop scrubbers into their waters. Instead, VLSFO and liquefied natural gas (LNG) are good choices in terms of environmental protection and economic benefits. Therefore, this study further evaluates the two strategies of replacing high sulfur fuel oil (HSFO) with VLSFO and converting diesel engines to LNG engines based on a cost-benefit methodology. This study took an 8500 TEU container vessel, which is powered by a marine diesel engine with the nominal power of 61,800 kW, sailing the Asian-European route as an example, and calculated the total incremental costs, pollutant emission reductions, and cost benefits arising from the implementation of the VLSFO and LNG strategies, respectively. According to the results of this study, the total incremental cost of LNG is higher than that of VLSFO in the first 4.7 years, but this gradually decreases, making the gap of the total incremental costs between the two strategies wider year by year. In comparison with using HSFO without any improvement, the total incremental costs of the VLSFO and LNG strategies increase by 12.94% and 22.16% over the following five years, respectively. The use of LNG can significantly reduce SOx, PM, NOx, and CO2 emissions; on the other hand, it leads to more CH4 emissions than the VLSFO strategy. Compared to doing nothing, the cumulative reduction rates of SOx, PM, NOx, and CO2 emissions over the next five years after the adoption of the LNG strategy are 3.6%, 7.0%, 70.4%, and 15.7%, respectively. The higher emission reduction rates of LNG compared to VLSFO illustrate that the former has a good effect on the suppression of exhaust gas pollution. In terms of the cost-benefit evaluation of the two strategies, this study shows that the VLSFO strategy is more cost-effective than the LNG strategy in the first 2.5 years, but that the cost-benefit ratio of the latter increases year by year and exceeds that of the former, and the gap between them widens year by year. Based on the evaluation results of this study, the LNG strategy is suitable for ocean-going container vessels with fixed routes and younger or larger sized vessels to meet the IMO low sulfur policy. In contrast, the VLSFO strategy is appropriate for old merchant ships with fewer container spaces. LNG is a suitable medium-and long-term strategy, i.e., for more than 2.5 years, for shipping lines to meet the IMO low sulfur policy, while VLSFO is a suitable short-term strategy.

AB  - The VSC-HVDC system performance has the most competitive and new feasible solution for integration of high wind penetration at offshore sites for efficient power transmission. This paper presents an overview of various control strategy for power converters and the plan of services in VSC-HVDC transmission. For long distance transmission line, reactance limits the transfer capability of high voltage alternating current (HVAC) system. With the advancement of VSC-HVDC technology reactance can be smoothly controlled, hence transfer capability can be enhanced. VSC-HVDC (voltage source converter- high voltage direct current) technology also meets the challenges that are faced by 2-level and multilevel converters. Rapid developments in IGBT open new gate for controlled strategy in converters. Due to this there is a paradigms shift in interfacing renewable energy with electric power system. The real and reactive power can be controlled indepedently by using VSC-HVDC system and black start capability is restored by an AC grid. This paper lays focus on VSC-HVDC transmission technology with integration offshore wind power. It will help operating engineers, designers, and research scholars to focus on this work and decision making. VSC-HVDC transmissions are giving ease of belongingness to energy transition.

AB  - The use of LNG as a fuel for passenger ships is currently attracting interest because the fuel is comparatively clean, eliminating SO x emissions and reducing NO x and CO 2 pollution by âˆ¼ 80 and 20%, respectively, and it is also cheap in comparison to the present oil prices. Bureau Veritas is working on solutions for LNG use in passenger vessels. A big issue for passenger ships that want to use LNG as a secondary fuel is finding sufficient space suitably located for the LNG storage. It may be above or below deck, in independent type B tanks for large capacity cold storage or type C pressurized tanks for limited capacity such as for short sea shipping. Technical solutions to install gas fuel engines in passenger vessels are in place, but there are still issues, including regulatory ones, to address. Bureau Veritas has recently updated NR 529 "Safety of gas-fuelled ships" and is working together with shipyards, operators and engine manufacturers to use LNG fuelled solutions to deliver what passengers and owners want.

JO  - Journal Of Chemical Engineering Of Japan
PY  - 2003
VL  - 36
IS  - 4
AB  - CO2 mitigation options have been overviewed from an engineering point of view. There have been proposed a number of mitigation options, which can be divided into three categories; 1. reduction of energy intensity; 2. reduction of carbon intensity; 3. carbon sequestration. In this review paper, various mitigation options are reviewed focusing on the carbon sequestration options. A reduction in energy intensity is essentially an energy saving. A reduction in carbon intensity could be achieved by switching to energy resources with lower carbon contents. Based on the 2001 IPCC report, the mitigation potential related to energy intensity is estimated at 1,900-2,600 Mt-C/year in 2010, and 3,600-5,050 Mt-C/year in 2020, including other greenhouse gas equivalents. There are additional benefits in implementing these options; they are economically beneficial, and have no associated harmful effects. The carbon sequestration options can be divided into two categories; the enhancement of the natural sinking rates of CO2, and a direct discharge of anthropogenic CO2. The relevant sequestration options in the first category include terrestrial sequestration by vegetation, ocean sequestration by fertilization, and an enhancement of the rock weathering process. In the direct discharge options, the CO2 produced from large point sources, such as thermal power stations, would be captured and separated, then transported and injected either into the ocean or underground. Although the sequestration options are less beneficial in terms of cost per unit CO, reduction compared to other options, technical developments in sequestration options are necessary for the following reasons; 1. A huge potential capacity for carbon sequestration, 2. carbon sequestration enables a continuous use of fossil fuels, which is unavoidable at the moment, before switching to renewable energy sources. Each sequestration option has advantages and disadvantages in terms of capacity, cost, the time scale of the sequestration, the stability of sequestered CO2, and additional environmental impacts, which depend on the location, time, and amount of sequestration. Thus, reliable evaluations of the mitigation efficiency are essential for each sequestration option upon implementation.

JO  - Renewable Energy
PY  - 2017

AB  - A significant number of estuaries in the UK not only have a high tidal range but also exhibit strong tidal currents, where tidal farms could be used for energy extraction. The purpose of this study is to examine the influence that the geometry of the channel has on the impact of a tidal farm deployed in an estuary. A hydrodynamic model (Mike21) has been used to model several idealised estuaries with dimensions based on a group of locations suitable for tidal energy extraction in the UK. The maximum changes in low and high water levels with the tidal farm have been identified for each case and located within the estuary. The changes in the time for the low and high tides in a point inside the estuary have also been analysed. It is noted that the maximum changes in water levels due to the farm range from the order of mm to a few dm and the locations of these changes are strongly dependent on the geometry of each case. In addition, the effect is generally more noticeable in the increase of low water levels and the decrease of high water levels than vice-versa. This would be associated with the loss of intertidal areas and the reduction of flood risk levels. In terms of the changes in the time of low and high water levels, the effects of the farm are negligible in all cases. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Seaweed farming is widely perceived as one of the most environmentally benign types of aquaculture activity. In the past 10 yr, global seaweed production has doubled and reached 31.8 million t. Farmed seaweed also has important functions in local ecosystems. We focus on the production, bioavailability, and bacterial degradation rates of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from cultured kelp Saccharina japonica. Semi in situ incubations in 2 growing seasons were conducted to estimate DOC production, and laboratory incubations were used to determine bioavailability and decay rates of DOC from cultured kelp. Results showed that DOC production was 6.2-7.0 mg C (g dry wt)(-1) d(-1) in the growing seasons, and the proportion of DOC in net primary production was 23.7-39.1\%. The decomposition rate of DOC was 4 +/- 1\% d(-1) and 9 +/- 1\% d(-1) in January and April, respectively. About 37.8\% remained as refractory DOC after 150 d incubation. It was calculated that the total DOC from kelp in Sanggou Bay was approximately 11.3 times of that from phytoplankton for the whole bay (144 km(2)). Our results suggest that more than half of the bioavailable DOC will be exported out of the bay to potentially support the wider food chain through bacterial uptake. Cultured kelp is therefore an important source of DOC in the embayment, contributes to the coastal DOC pool and provides a potential pathway for carbon dioxide sequestration.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9
IS  - 1
AB  - Coastal vegetated ecosystems are major organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) sinks, but the mechanisms that regulate their spatial variability need to be better understood. Here we assessed how superficial sedimentary OC and TN within intertidal vegetated assemblages (saltmarsh and seagrass) vary along a flow gradient, which is a major driver of sediment grain size, and thus of organic matter (OM) content. A significant relationship between flow current velocity and OC and TN stocks in the seagrass was found, but not in the saltmarsh. OC and TN stocks of the saltmarsh were larger than the seagrass, even though that habitat experiences shorter hydroperiods. Mixing models revealed that OM sources also varied along the flow gradient within the seagrass, but not in the saltmarsh, showing increasing contributions of microphytobenthos (17â€“32%) and decreasing contributions of POM (45â€“35%). As well, OM sources varied vertically as microphytobenthos contribution was highest at the higher intertidal saltmarsh (48%), but not POM (39%). Macroalgae, seagrass and saltmarsh showed low contributions. Local trade-offs between flow current velocities, hydroperiod and structural complexity of vegetation must be considered, at both horizontal and vertical (elevation) spatial dimensions, for better estimates of blue carbon and nitrogen in coastal ecosystems.

AB  - The assessment of the effects of Ocean Acidification (OA) on marine life has received increasing attention in recent marine research. On a mesocosmic scale, the CO2 levels in seawater can be manipulated to evaluate experimentally the consequences of OA on marine organisms (vertebrates and invertebrates). An ideal manipulation of carbonate chemistry should mimic exactly the changes to carbonate chemistry, which will occur in years to come. Although some methods have been described in the literature, here we describe in detail a simple, robust and inexpensive system to produce CO2-enriched seawater by bubbling the seawater with air-CO2 mixtures. The system uses mass flow controllers (MFC) to blend atmospheric air with pure CO2 to produce two pCO(2) levels. The air-CO2 mixtures are delivered continuously to seawater equilibration reservoirs, and simultaneously to an infrared CO2 analyser to verify CO2 levels in the air-CO2 mixture delivered to the equilibration tanks. We monitored both pH and total alkalinity in the equilibration reservoirs over a period of one year in order to document the long-term performance of this system for simulating the future carbonate chemistry of seawater in a coastal laboratory. System performance was sufficient to maintain three contrasting (e.g., 397, 709 and 1032 matm) and relatively constant (the coefficient of variability was 11 \%, 9 \% and 9 \% respectively) seawater pCO(2) during a year-long monitoring.

A theoretical model is presented based on the linearized velocity potential, the image theory and the matched axisymmetric eigenfunction expansion formulations. The WECs under examination are the heaving absorber and the oscillating water column device. From the present analysis it is demonstrated that the absorbed wave power by the examined WECs in front of a vertical wall is strongly affected by the geometrical parameters of the converters and their mechanical components, and these should be considered when designing the WEC-breakwater system so as to increase its wave power efficiency.

AB  - Monitoring productivity in coastal wetlands is important due to their high carbon sequestration rates and potential role in climate change mitigation. We tested agricultural- and forest-based methods for estimating the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (f APAR), a key parameter for modelling gross primary productivity (GPP), in a restored, managed wetland with a dense litter layer of non-photosynthetic vegetation, and we compared the difference in canopy light transmission between a tidally influenced wetland and the managed wetland. The presence of litter reduced correlations between spectral vegetation indices and f APAR. In the managed wetland, a two-band vegetation index incorporating simulated World View-2 or Hyperion green and near-infrared bands, collected with a field spectroradiometer, significantly correlated with f APAR only when measured above the litter layer, not at the ground where measurements typically occur. Measures of GPP in these systems are difficult to capture via remote sensing, and require an investment of sampling effort, practical methods for measuring green leaf area and accounting for background effects of litter and water.

AB  - The marine auxiliary diesel engines installed in the large transoceanic ships are used in order to generate the electricity but at the same time these engines are able to produce a significant amount of the harmful exhaust gas emissions. Therefore the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) concluded an agreement, which has to control generating of gaseous emissions in maritime transport. From this reason started to be used some of the alternative fuels in this branch. There was performed a study, which investigated emissions of the auxiliary marine diesel engine during application of the experimental fuels. The different testing fuels were created using the ratios 0%, 50%, 80% and 100% between the biodiesel and the ULSDF (Ultra Low Sulphur Diesel Fuel). The experimental measurements were performed at the different engine loading levels and various engine speeds in order to investigate an influence of the mixed fuels on the engine operational characteristics.

TI  - GIS-based site suitability analysis for wind farm development in Saudi Arabia
JO  - Energy
PY  - 2017
VL  - 141
IS  - NA
AB  - The harmful effects of traditional methods of power generation on the environment has created a need to strategically plan and develop renewable and sustainable energy generation systems. This paper presents the wind farm site suitability analysis using multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach based on geographic information system (GIS) modeling. This analysis is based on different climatic, economic, aesthetic and environmental criteria like wind resource, accessibility by roads, proximity to the electrical grid, and optimum/safe distance from various settlements and airports. Using information from published literature, criteria constraints like buffer zones, exclusion zones and suitability scores for each criteria is developed. An analytical hierarchy process, AHP is employed to assign appropriate weights to the criteria according to their relative importance. The developed model is then applied to the entire Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The most suitable sites are found to be (i) near Ras Tanura on the coast in the Eastern Province; (ii) Turaif in Al-Jawf region at northern borders and (iii) Al-Wajh on the coast in the western region. The central and southeastern region is found to be unsuitable mainly due to scarce wind resource, few settlements and less connectivity by roads and electrical grid. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Cerium-modified biochar: A recycling biomaterial for regulating phosphorus availability in paddy ecosystem from coastal mudflat reclamation
JO  - Geoderma
PY  - 2019
VL  - 346
IS  - NA
AB  - Phosphorus (P) is a vital element for plant growth, especially in mudflat-reclaimed soil due to its extra alleviation of adverse effect by salt stress. P availability in mudflat-reclaimed soil is a critical factor for crop yield. In this study, cerium-modified straw biochar (Ce-MSB) derived from maize straw was prepared and characterized and its influence on P availability of the paddy soil was evaluated. The results indicated that the cerium elements were chemically bound to the functional groups of the biochar surface through SEM, EDX and FTIR techniques. The equilibrium process of P by Ce-MSB was described well by the Langmuir isotherm model (R-2 > 0.99). The maximal P adsorption capacity of Ce-MSB was influenced remarkably by temperature. Accordingly, the addition of Ce-MSB significantly decreased the P content of surface water in paddy system after 3 months, while increasing the soil P availability. Furthermore, the incorporation of both common biochar and Ce-MSB into the soil increased the SOM content, while decreased soil pH and EC. Biolog EcoPlateTM trials indicated that Ce-MSB has no significantly negative effects on soil microbial diversity. This study provides valuable information for the source-reduction of P discharge from paddy system and improvement of P availability.

VL  - 31
IS  - 3
AB  - Over the past decade regulatory emission control has been adopted and even stricter emission reductions are being considered. In order to comply with the present and future regulations the ship owners and engine manufacturers are facing a difficult task. The shipping industry is presently offering multiple choices such as scrubbers and Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), dual fuel engines, Liquefied Natural Gas / Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LNG/LPG) powered engines, and lately the introduction of methanol and ethanol as alternative fuels. This work presents a short overview of the possible use of methanol and ethanol as alternative fuels in shipping. The first part of this work deals with physical properties of methanol and ethanol, production and availability, as well as advantages and disadvantages in comparison with other fuels. In the second part the cost perspective is presented together with the cost-benefit analysis, which is the most important aspect in the ship owner's decision whether to invest into the new alternative. Methanol and ethanol are not magical solutions, but rather another alternative which, from the cost perspective, offers a potential under certain circumstances. These circumstances are competitive prices in comparison to Marine Gas Oil (MGO) and time spent in Emission Control Area (ECA) which should be a large portion of the total sailing time. In this paper the scientific methodology was followed by using the method of compilation, the descriptive and the comparative methods.

TI  - High-CO2 Levels Rather than Acidification Restrict Emiliania huxleyi Growth and Performance
JO  - Microbial Ecology
PY  - NA
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - The coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi shows a variety of responses to ocean acidification (OA) and to high-CO2 concentrations, but there is still controversy on differentiating between these two factors when using different strains and culture methods. A heavily calcified type A strain isolated from the Norwegian Sea was selected and batch cultured in order to understand whether acclimation to OA was mediated mainly by CO2 or H+, and how it impacted cell growth performance, calcification, and physiological stress management. Emiliania huxleyi responded differently to each acidification method. CO2-enriched aeration (1200 mu atm, pH 7.62) induced a negative effect on the cells when compared to acidification caused by decreasing pH alone (pH 7.60). The growth rates of the coccolithophore were more negatively affected by high pCO(2) than by low pH without CO2 enrichment with respect to the control (400 mu atm, pH 8.1). High CO2 also affected cell viability and promoted the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which was not observed under low pH. This suggests a possible metabolic imbalance induced by high CO2 alone. In contrast, the affinity for carbon uptake was negatively affected by both low pH and high CO2. Photochemistry was only marginally affected by either acidification method when analysed by PAM fluorometry. The POC and PIC cellular quotas and the PIC:POC ratio shifted along the different phases of the cultures; consequently, calcification did not follow the same pattern observed in cell stress and growth performance. Specifically, acidification by HCl addition caused a higher proportion of severely deformed coccoliths, than CO2 enrichment. These results highlight the capacity of CO2 rather than acidification itself to generate metabolic stress, not reducing calcification.

TI  - Potential of sub-seafloor CO2 geological storage in northern South China Sea and its importance for CCS development in South China
JO  - NANA
PY  - 2013
VL  - 37
IS  - NA
AB  - The South China, especially Guangdong Province, as the most developed area of China emitted large CO2 from energy consumption and industrial production, actively advocates low-carbon development strategies. As an effective option to reduce CO2 emissions, CCS is potentially an effective option to reduce CO2 emissions to low-carbon economy development of South China, especially to Guangdong province. The CO2 storage potential in sedimentary basins onshore South China is limited as previous indicated. So the potential of sub-seafloor CO2 storage in offshore basins would be important. According to the assessment in this paper, large sedimentary basins offshore in the northern SCS have huge CO2 storage potential. Miocene deltaic, coastal plain, and neritic clastic rocks in these basins contain high-porosity and high-permeability aquifers and excellent seals. The estimated effective storage capacity, which is 2.6\% of the theoretical capacity, is similar to 300 GtCO(2) in PRMB, similar to 57 GtCO(2) in BBGB, similar to 41Gt CO2 in QDNB and similar to 160Gt CO2 in YGHB. On the whole, the Tertiary sedimentary basins in northern SCS margin have large storage capacities of abut 567Gt CO2, which provide a promising storage option for CCS implementation in South China. As the high costs is a major obstacles for sub-seafloor CO2 storage, the reuse of infrastructures for oil and gas development, such as platforms, wells and pipelines, would be the first choice. Although the theoretical storage capacities of the offshore oil and gas fields in the northern SCS are small, they distributed as groups and clusters and associated with sufficient quantified CO2 storage capacity in the saline aquifers. Further assessments are needed to define the residual life (= equipment life minus the field life) of the infrastructures, their practical and matched storage capacities, as well as a proper character and site screening particularly in regard to containment and risk of leakage. All these have been done well ahead of the real abandons of the oil/gas fields, so that the fields are in ``CO2 Storage Readiness (CSR){''}. (c) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

JO  - Journal Of Geophysical Research: Oceans
PY  - 2012
VL  - 117
IS  - 8
AB  - Determining a robust trend of surface ocean carbon dioxide (CO2) for a period shorter than a decade is challenging due to large seasonal variability and a sparsity of data. Here, we estimate the multiannual trend of surface CO2 in the region of 19N-20N, 65W-68W for the period of 2002-2009. We used an unprecedented number of high-quality underway data of the fugacity of CO2 in surface seawater (fCO2SW) collected from 137 cruises using an automated system onboard the cruise ship Explorer of the Seas. The growth rate of fCO2SW was estimated by two de-seasonalization approaches that showed similar and significantly lower values than the atmospheric increases, leading to a large increase in the CO 2 sink. The seasonal difference in the trends was significant, with fCO2SW values in winter showing no increase, while summer fCO 2SW values lagged only slightly with the atmosphere. We attribute the lack of an increase in winter fCO2SW values to sea surface temperature changes, which are closely correlated with the El Nio-Southern Oscillation cycle, and to changes in the mixed layer depth. The slower increase of fCO2SW is also related to decreases in salinity. The 8-year averaged annual net sea-air CO2 flux was -0.06 0.18 mol m -2 yr-1 compared to a climatology that shows a flux out of the ocean of +0.11 mol m-2 yr-1. The increasing flux differs from previous, mostly longer-term results for regional studies and time series stations in the North Atlantic, which suggests a decrease or no change in oceanic CO2 uptake.

TI  - Long-term acclimation to near-future ocean acidification has negligible effects on energetic attributes in a juvenile coral reef fish
JO  - Oecologia
PY  - 2019
VL  - 190
IS  - 3
AB  - Increased levels of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) drive ocean acidification and have been predicted to increase the energy use of marine fishes via physiological and behavioural mechanisms. This notion is based on a theoretical framework suggesting that detrimental effects on energy use are caused by plasma acid-base disruption in response to hypercapnic acidosis, potentially in combination with a malfunction of the gamma aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors in the brain. However, the existing empirical evidence testing these effects primarily stems from studies that exposed fish to elevated CO2 for a few days and measured a small number of traits. We investigated a range of energetic traits in juvenile spiny chromis damselfish (Acanthochromis polyacanthus) over 3months of acclimation to projected end-of-century CO2 levels (similar to 1000 mu atm). Somatic growth and otolith size and shape were unaffected by the CO2 treatment across 3months of development in comparison with control fish (similar to 420 mu atm). Swimming activity during behavioural assays was initially higher in the elevated CO2 group, but this effect dissipated within similar to 25min following handling. The transient higher activity of fish under elevated CO2 was not associated with a detectable difference in the rate of oxygen uptake nor was it mediated by GABA(A) neurotransmitter interference because treatment with a GABA(A) antagonist (gabazine) did not abolish the CO2 treatment effect. These findings contrast with several short-term studies by suggesting that end-of-century levels of CO2 may have negligible direct effects on the energetics of at least some species of fish.

TI  - The 44-year Mediterranean HIPOCAS wind database: A useful tool to analyse offshore extreme wind events from a long-term regional perspective
JO  - Coastal Engineering
PY  - 2008
VL  - 55
IS  - 11
AB  - Nowadays, many efforts are leading to use the high potential offshore wind energy resources. A detailed assessment of the offshore wind resources arises as a first-rate requirement. Most of such assessment is based on extreme offshore wind atlas generated mainly from global reanalysis and satellite data. Both sort of data show certain shortcomings related, among others, to coarse spatial resolution and time inhomogeneity issues, respectively. This snag seems to be crucial over areas such as the Mediterranean Basin, which is characterized by a complex land-sea distribution and a significant orography. The HIPOCAS Mediterranean long-term (1958-2001) wind database comes to overcome the aforementioned reanalysis shortcoming and provides a Mediterranean wind data set useful to perform extreme wind analysis. This contribution also deals with a statistical extreme wind analysis over the whole Mediterranean offshore areas. Extreme return periods and levels are obtained from annual maxima using a number of distributions. Additionally, an alternative regional statistical method based on regional L-moment statistics is also proposed. The regional technique is applied to reduce uncertainty and allows a higher number of measurements to be included in the analysis, using data from a homogeneous region instead of from a single location. The herein performed extreme wind analysis provides a detailed assessment of high wind offshore areas over the Mediterranean and constitutes a subject of great interest for evaluation of wind resources.

PY  - 2015

IS  - 5
AB  - The extraction of hydrokinetic energy from ocean currents or tides involves the use of marine turbines generating turbulent wakes. The prediction of the wake characteristics is essential because the velocity deficit and increased levels in turbulence intensity dictate the interaction between turbines and any environment impact. A numerical methodology combining the parabolised Navier-Stokes equations with a modified actuator-disk model is presented. The main innovation of the modified actuator-disk model is that the flow is considered to be non-uniform downstream of the turbine. The numerical method is used to reproduce the experiments of Neary et al. (2013) and Mycek et al. (2014). The computational results show that the modification in the actuator-disk model aids in the reproduction of the experimental measurements. The simulations also show that increased levels in the ambient turbulence intensity cause a faster recovery in the turbulent wake, which agrees with experiments.

AB  - There is an urgent need to replace petroleum-based plastic with bio-based and biodegradable alternatives. Polyhydroxyal-kanoates (PHAs) are attractive prospective replacements that exhibit desirable mechanical properties and are recyclable and biodegradable in terrestrial and marine environments. However, the production costs today still limit the economic sustainability of the PHA industry. Seaweed cultivation represents an opportunity for carbon capture, while also supplying a sustainable photosynthetic feedstock for PHA production. We mined existing gene and protein databases to identify bacteria able to grow and produce PHAs using seaweed-derived carbohydrates as substrates. There were no significant relationships between the genes involved in the deconstruction of algae polysaccharides and PHA production, with poor to negative correlations and diffused clustering suggesting evolutionary compartmentalism. We identified 2987 bacterial candidates spanning 40 taxonomic families predominantly within Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Burkholderiales with enriched seaweed-degrading capacity that also harbour PHA synthesis potential. These included highly promising candidates with specialist and generalist specificities, including Alteromonas, Aquisphaera, Azotobacter, Bacillus, Caulobacter, Cellvibrionaceae, Duganella, Janthinobacterium, Massilia, Oxalobacteraceae, Parvularcula, Pirellulaceae, Pseudomonas, Rhizobacter, Rhodanobacter, Simiduia, Sphingobium, Sphingomonadaceae, Sphingomonas, Stieleria, Vibrio and Xanthomonas. In this enriched subset, the family-level densities of genes targeting green macroalgae polysaccharides were considerably higher (n=231.6Â±68.5) than enzymes targeting brown (n=65.34Â±13.12) and red (n=30.5Â±10.72) polysaccharides. Within these organisms, an abundance of FabG genes was observed, suggesting that the fatty acid de novo synthesis pathway supplies (R)âˆ’3-hydroxyacyl-CoA or 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA from core metabolic processes and is the predominant mechanism of PHA production in these organisms. Our results facilitate extending seaweed biomass valorization in the context of consolidated biorefining for the production of bioplastics. Â© 2022 The Authors.

JO  - Ecological Indicators
PY  - 2021
VL  - 129
IS  - NA
AB  - Labile fractions of soil carbon pools are sensitive to environmental changes, which would influence the stabilization of soil carbon. However, it is unclear whether the dynamics of labile organic carbon (LOC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) are coupled and how they influence each other in coastal wetland. The present work investigated the trends of soil carbon fractions among mangrove and Spartina alterniflora communities with different stand ages (1, 5, 10, and 15 years), at Quanzhou Bay Estuary Wetland Nature Reserve, China. We found that SOC in a mangrove ecosystem increased over time, while there was no significant trend in S. alterniflora dominated ecosystems. The highest LOC of mangrove appeared in 5-year-old communities, and then decreased with stand age. In S. alterniflora communities, content of labile fractions increased with the stand age. These trends indicated different soil carbon dynamics when comparing mangrove and S. alterniflora ecosystems. The development of mangroves promoted accumulation of recalcitrant carbon, while S. alterniflora ecosystems contributed to an increase of labile carbon. This phenomenon is probably caused by the characteristics of vegetation and the hydrological conditions. Mangroves contribute more refractory organic carbon to the soil carbon pool, while accumulation of LOC in S. alterniflora communities may inhibit the stabilization of SOC. Our study on the relationship of LOC and SOC implies that complex interactions occur among soil carbon pools and environmental conditions in coastal wetlands, suggesting soil carbon models should take into account decoupled dynamics of LOC and SOC.

AB  - By burning of fossil fuels humankind emits more than 8 billion tons of carbon (Gt C) in the form of CO2 to the atmosphere. Since the onset of the industrial revolution the cumulative emissions have led to an increase of the atmospheric CO2 concentration which corresponds to an additional radiative forcing in the atmosphere. Of the three reservoirs which exchange carbon on the time scale of centuries - atmosphere, terrestrial biosphere, and ocean - the ocean is by far the largest. The marine CO2 system comprises the chemical species HCO3-, CO2- 3, and CO2(aq). This gives rise to the pH-buffering nature of seawater as well as its high uptake capacity for anthropogenic CO 2. Four measurement parameters of the marine CO2 system are available for an accurate analytical characterization. These parameters also provide a means of sensing the role of physical, chemical, and biological drivers for the marine carbon cycle. The marine carbon cycle features major natural processes that exchange carbon with the atmosphere and re-distribute it throughout the ocean. These are known as "pumps" and driven by physical and biological factors. While the "physical pump" is inevitably enhanced by the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2, even the sign of the response is currently not clear for the "biological pumps". A host of potential consequences of global change (temperature rise, ocean carbonation, ocean acidification) have been identified. These are currently studied intensively with respect to their climate sensitivity as well as the climate feedback potential. Â© 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - As part of ship acquisition decision making, owners and key stakeholders need to evaluate ship design and technology solutions across economic and environmental criteria in addition to safety and other regulatory requirements. Changes in technology, market, fiscal and other regulatory conditions may furthermore significantly influence value retention over the investment period. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) provides structure and clarity in otherwise complex decision problems, allowing decision makers to identify promising courses of action in a holistic manner. Combined with stochastic evaluation techniques, MCDM may facilitate problem exploration and learning in situations where outcomes are uncertain. In this article, we combine two variants of â€œStochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysisâ€ (SMAA) with â€œTechnique for Ordering of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solutionâ€ (TOPSIS) to evaluate the use of biofuels, natural gas and electricity on Norwegian ferry crossings. We analyze uncertain criteria values for environmental impacts, costs, fuel access and public acceptance across seven ferry combinations for a crossing. Criteria weighting is performed deterministically and stochastically to extract and interpret the conditions under which alternatives perform well or poorly. The case study shows that all-electric propulsion is preferable, while plug-in hybrid solutions with natural gas also give a robust performance. The approach is beneficial in handling multiple, uncertain performance metrics and provides a transparent and holistic foundation for evaluating marine emission reduction technology options in ship acquisition decision contexts.

AB  - The regular periodicity of astronomical tides allows their accurate prediction, and so it should be possible to determine how best to optimise the future distribution of arrays of tidal energy devices for any shelf sea region. By considering together the magnitude and phase of tidal currents over a shelf sea region, maximum aggregated power generation, with minimal periods of low generation, can be deduced. Here, we make use of the greedy algorithm to optimise future exploitation of the tidal stream resource over the northwest European shelf seas, a region which contains a world-leading tidal energy resource. We also apply a penalty function to the greedy algorithm, favouring the selection of future hypothetical sites where power generation would be out-of-phase with previously developed sites. Our results demonstrate that the Pentland Firth and Channel Islands would be optimal sites for parallel development for relatively low numbers of arrays, with important contributions from the Irish Sea for larger scale exploitation. Although there is minimal phase diversity between European tidal stream sites to deliver firm power generation, it is possible that tidal range could contribute to such baseload through the parallel development of lagoons or impoundments.

AB  - The synergetic offshore wind dataset derived from a combination of scatterometers (QuikSCAT, OSCAT and ASCAT-A, B) have been utilised and validated with available buoy data. It is observed that, the mean deviation in wind speed between the co-located buoy and synergetic scatterometer data is small of the order 2\% and the power density showed a difference of 2.5\%. The combined synergetic maps of wind speed, wind power density and practical power production from two offshore wind turbines V112 3M and G128 5M have been analysed and evaluated on a seasonal and annual basis. Further, considering the available area after exclusions, conflict regions due to shipping, visual and avian exclusions, India has a net power production of 364 GW (3190 TWh/yr) for V112 3M and 516 GW (4522 TWh/yr) for G128 5M turbines at 80 m hub height. This would reduce overall carbon emissions of 3117 and 4418 million tons respectively per year. Finally, the Levelised cost of energy is computed for two optimum sites in shallow waters off Gujarat and Tamil Nadu coasts and found to be lowest of around 106.87 (sic)/MWh in Tamil Nadu site, suggesting an optimum site for wind farm development.

AB  - A submerged wave energy point absorber, TWED (Torres Wave Energy Device), has been studied under regular and irregular wave conditions. A partial non-linear time domain model of the TWED has been implemented in Simulink. The numerical model was exploited to test the sensibility of the TWED performance to changes in some variables under regular waves: generator damping constant, floater diameter, depth, frictions and drag coefficients. In this paper, the TWED was also optimized for maximum energy production under a real wave climate. To obtain the average wave performance of the converter, a 44 year series of data record has been employed. The objective functions have been the Average Absorbed Power (AAP) and the sea-state generator damping constant (K). After the optimization, AAP full time series have been obtained. Then several statistics analysis for AAP has been carried out for different time intervals; in order to study the variability of AAP. In addition, an evaluation of the TWED behaviour in a sea state in the Operation Limit has been studied. It has been found that the instantaneous absorbed power in a sea state could be as much as 20 times higher than the mean absorbed power. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Valorization of the chemical diversity of the tropical red seaweeds Acanthophora and Kappaphycus and their applications in aquaculture: A review
JO  - Frontiers In Marine Science
PY  - 2022
VL  - 9
IS  - NA
AB  - The role that seaweeds play as primary producers and ecosystems engineers in marine coastal ecosystems is widely acknowledged. Seaweeds, however, are also important drivers in the development of the blue bioeconomy due to their vast diversity of unique chemicals with a broad range of industrial and biotechnological applications. In tropical regions, seaweed production has been focused on a few species only, because of their hydrocolloids used in the food industry. There is a strong need to identify new applications of red seaweed species in other sectors such as aquaculture. Therefore, to diversify the culture of red seaweeds, more tropical species need to be investigated for their chemical composition and potential application in aquaculture, and then, to develop a method for a sustainable cultivation of new seaweed candidates and enhance their economic potential. Based on this context, we analyze the potential value of the red edible seaweed Acanthophora spp., an under-valued seaweed species which is naturally abundant in tropical countries, and Kappaphycus spp., a commercially valuable seaweed commonly used for polysaccharide extraction. The vast chemical diversity of seaweeds (polysaccharides, phytohormones, amino acids, and pigments) has led to research on a wide range of applications in aquaculture, including pathogen control, immunostimulant, antioxidant, bioremediation, feed, UV protectants, increase in seafood shelf life, animal colorant, and growth regulator for microalga culture. This review hopes to stimulate the interest among seaweed researchers to investigate other local seaweed species and seek greater added value of their biomass and chemical compounds and their applications in the aquaculture sector. Additionally, this information will help stakeholders to benefit from these two red seaweeds by contributing to the diversification of the blue bioeconomy in tropical countries.

AB  - As the largest archipelagic country globally, Indonesia holds great energy potential to be used as electric energy, one of which is ocean wave energy. Energy from ocean waves that never run out and can reach many remote islands, becomes the optimal option to be used as a power plant in supplying electricity in Indonesia's 3T (Underdeveloped, Frontmost, and Outermost). By utilizing the movement of waves in oscillating columns, ocean wave power plants-oscillating water column (PLTGL-OWC) become one of the simplest types of power plants, and easy to apply in various locations. This study aims to see the potential of the electric power generated by PLTGL-OWC. The data used is a hindcast of wave height, wavelength and the period from Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika (BMKG) during 2013-2018. Electrical power is obtained after calculating the power of ocean waves and then multiplied by the efficiency of the OWC system in this study, which is 11.917% in units of kW. It was found that the condition of sea wave height in the 3T region in this study peaked in the JJA period when the Australian monsoon was active. The area with the tremendous potential for generating power is located in West Coast Regency, Lampung with an average electrical power of 25.85 kW per year, while the lowest power potential is in Nias Regency, which is 0.12 kW per year.

With this in mind, port authorities, ship-owners, industry suppliers and regulators are now focusing on the decadeold technology known as shore-to-ship power, for which universal electrical standards are on the verge of being ratified by IEEE, ISO and the IEC. Onshore power supply allows commercial ships calling at ports to turn off their diesel engines and tap into cleaner energy sources. Having successfully delivered the world's first shore-to-ship power connection to the port of Gothenburg, Sweden in 2000, ABB has not only the technologies but also the experience required to make the complete connection, onboard and onshore.

AB  - Wind power generation plays a critical role in meeting the energy demand in Denmark. Due to increasing penetration of renewable energy, and in particular wind power, the frequency deviation has become a national problem that needs to be solved urgently to continue the positive development of renewables. In this paper, a co-optimization method of an offshore wind farm with the battery energy storage system (BESS) is proposed which enable the wind farm to participate in both days ahead (DA) electricity market and primary frequency control reserve market. The optimization problem involves the hourly bidding energy, charging and discharging status which creates a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. The bilinear term is linearized using big M method in this work and thus the facilitate the conversion from a MINLP to a MILP problem. The results show that the wind farm owner can obtain more profits if they want to provide ancillary service using the proposed bidding strategy. It is expected that such proposition could ensure market and political support for continuous wind power installations in Denmark. Â© 2018 IEEE.

AB  - One of the main concerns of our society is certainly environmental protection. The international efforts for maintaining a clean environment are various and this paper refers to the efforts in the maritime transport field. The subject of our study is the concept of Energy Efficiency Operational Index (EEOI), developed to provide ship-owners with assistance in the process of establishing the emissions from ships in operation, and to suggest the methods for achieving their reduction. As a monitoring tool, EEOI represents the mass of CO2 emitted per unit of transport work. Using the software developed by the authors, it will emphasize the variation of the EEOI value for one vessel using different types of fuel during the laden and ballast voyages, for a period of three months, as stated in the Ship's Log Books. The main consumers considered are Main Engine, Diesel Generators and steam Boilers, and the types of fuel used will be as per charter party agreements and following the specific international and local rules and regulations. The results for the quality parameter EEOI and the average cost of achieving them will be included in compared cost-to-quality graphs, in order to underline the profitability of the studied methods for minimizing the air emissions.

AB  - In order to accelerate the access into the energy market for ocean renewables, the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs for these technologies must be reduced. In this paper a reliability-based simulation tool for the optimization of the management of an offshore renewable energy (ORE) farm is presented. The proposed tool takes into account the reliability data of the simulated devices and estimations on the energy produced to create a series of results in terms of availability and maintainability of the farm. The information produced supports operational and strategic decision making regarding the O&M for offshore farms. A case study simulating a conceptual tidal energy project, consisting of an array of two tidal turbines located off the north coast of Scotland, is presented to show some of the results achievable with this model. The proposed methodology, although adopted for a tidal farm here, is generally applicable to other kinds of ORE farms. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In December 2003, the International Maritime Organisation Assembly adopted resolution A.963(23) on policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from international maritime commercial shipping. The outcomes to date are three policies; the " Energy Efficiency Design Index " (EEDI), the " Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan" (SEEMP) and the " Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator" (EEOI). The first two of these were included in MARPOL Annex VI Chapter 4 in July 2011 at MEPC 62 and apply to certain types of commercial ships. Although warships are exempt from IMO regulations, many navies throughout the world strive to meet IMO environmental regulations. As most navies are a reflection of their governments" policy, environmental stewardship is generally held as a high priority for navies during peacetime operations. This paper explores if and how the EEDI and SEEMP can be applied to warships.

JO  - International Journal Of Hydrogen Energy
PY  - 2014
VL  - 39
IS  - 29
AB  - One of the main challenges that our society must overcome in this century is that of finding alternative energy sources to fossil fuels. These, ideally, must be inexpensive, less polluting than current fuels and available for a substantial time. One promising alternative is hydrogen, which has the great advantage that it can be produced by coupling renewable energy devices with water electrolysis. Several projects devoted to connecting photovoltaic and wind systems with electrolysis devices have been successful; however, little research has been done into the coupling of ocean wave energy converters with water electrolysis. The work here proposes a basic system that stores the energy from waves in the form of hydrogen. The WEC considered is a novel design known as a Blow-Jet, which captures waves and converts them into a water jet. The performance of the Blow-Jet is found to depend more on wavelength than on wave height. The electrolyser results show, at 0.200 A and 1.88 V, that the electrolysis of water produces 0.082 Nl h(-1) of hydrogen and a current efficiency (eta(I)) of 90.58\%.

AB  - This paper presents a method of operating a zero-emission power system in marine vessels. The main goal of the proposed method is to reduce losses of drivetrain devices. The power sources considered in this work are proton exchange membrane fuel cell and lithium-ion battery while the main power consumers are induction motors driven propulsion system. Both sources and consumers are connected to a common DC bus through power conversion devices. In the proposed method, the DC bus voltage level is controlled according to the loading of the fuel cells. By controlling the DC bus voltage, it allows operation of fuel cell DC/DC converter in freewheeling mode which significantly reduces the converter losses. In addition, this approach is also expected to reduce the motor and battery drive losses. Feasibility of the proposed operation method and loss calculations are presented on a real-time hardware-in-loop simulator consisting of real control units and virtual power device models.

AB  - Marine engines often use diesel as an alternative fuel to improve the economy. In recent years, waste oil, biodiesel and alcohol fuel are the most famous research directions among the alternative fuels for diesel. With the rapid development of the shipping industry, the air of coastal areas is becoming increasingly polluted. It is now necessary to reduce the emission of marine engines to meet the strict emission regulations. There are many types of alternative fuels for diesel oil and the difference of the fuel may interfere with the engine emissions; however, PM, HC, CO and other emissions will have a negative impact on SCR catalyst. This paper reviews the alternative fuels such as alcohols, waste oils, biodiesel made from vegetable oil and animal oil, and then summarizes and analyzes the influence of different alternative fuels on engine emissions and pollutant formation mechanism. In addition, this paper also summarizes the methods that can effectively reduce the emissions of marine engines; it can provide a reference for the study of diesel alternative fuel and the reduction of marine engine emissions.

AB  - One of the newly emerging environmental issues is underwater noise pollution. It has both negative environmental and socio-economic impacts and threatens sustainable shipping. While other types of shipping pollutants have been regulated and societal awareness has been raised, due to the intangible characteristics of underwater noise pollution, there is neither societal awareness nor an international legally binding instrument to mitigate underwater noise pollution. This paper aims to raise awareness of ship owners regarding UWN pollution by introducing the sources of UWN pollution, as well as proposing a transdisciplinary policy for shipping companies to mitigate UWN pollution from their ships. The proposed policy is aligned with IMO's initial GHG strategy, especially the Energy Efficiency Design Index, Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index, and Enhanced Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan. This multi-dimensional approach will make stakeholders more enthusiastic to tackle underwater noise pollution while enhancing the efficient use of capacities and resources.

AB  - Saving fuel and reducing emissions are major drivers in the marine industry, with a large number of potential modifications and machinery options available to enable the greening of shipping. Assessing which technology and what combination of solutions gives favourable economic results needs careful consideration of the vessel's operational profile. Electrification of shipboard systems introduces operational flexibility, offering the potential for fuel savings and emission reductions. Auxiliary drives, energy storage and onshore power supply are three approaches which address the issues of ship fuel consumption/emissions, specifically during in-harbour operation of vessels. In this paper, the impact of these three technologies on ship environmental performance and energy consumption is assessed by considering a real case RoRo vessel sailing a real operational profile. Models of the resultant system are built such that the machinery configurations can be analysed separately or in conjunction with each other. The results stress the importance of the operational profile of the vessel, showing significant fuel and emissions reductions during in-harbour operations but relatively small savings when considering operation through a complete return voyage. The sensitivity of the results to fuel and utility costs are also considered and shown to have a large impact on the economic feasibility (or otherwise) of different solutions. Â© 2016

AB  - In the near future, offshore wind farms will become the most important local power sources in China's coastal provinces. In this context, this paper first summarizes the main problems faced by the power grid fed by large-scale offshore wind power. These problems include commutation failure of DC system, limitation of wind power absorption, insufficient voltage stability, continuous weakening of frequency stability, insufficient power angle stability and overtop short-circuit current in AC system. Therefore, this paper puts forward a series of strengthening methods, including adding equipment, changing grid structure and applying flexible HVDC transmission technology. Meanwhile, we also explain the applicable scenarios of different measures. Finally, a case study is carried out in Jiangsu power grid, and a scheme of building a three-terminal flexible HVDC transmission system across the Yangtze River is proposed. This scheme can strengthen the voltage stability and eliminate the undesirable limitation of wind power absorption in Suzhou. Â© 2021 IEEE.

JO  - Environmental Research Letters
PY  - 2018
VL  - 13
IS  - 3
AB  - The chemical weathering of rocks currently absorbs about 1.1 Gt CO2 a-1 being mainly stored as bicarbonate in the ocean. An enhancement of this slow natural process could remove substantial amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere, aiming to offset some unavoidable anthropogenic emissions in order to comply with the Paris Agreement, while at the same time it may decrease ocean acidification. We provide the first comprehensive assessment of economic costs, energy requirements, technical parameterization, and global and regional carbon removal potential. The crucial parameters defining this potential are the grain size and weathering rates. The main uncertainties about the potential relate to weathering rates and rock mass that can be integrated into the soil. The discussed results do not specifically address the enhancement of weathering through microbial processes, feedback of geogenic nutrient release, and bioturbation. We do not only assess dunite rock, predominantly bearing olivine (in the form of forsterite) as the mineral that has been previously proposed to be best suited for carbon removal, but focus also on basaltic rock to minimize potential negative side effects. Our results show that enhanced weathering is an option for carbon dioxide removal that could be competitive already at 60 US $ t-1 CO2 removed for dunite, but only at 200 US $ t-1 CO2 removed for basalt. The potential carbon removal on cropland areas could be as large as 95 Gt CO2 a-1 for dunite and 4.9 Gt CO2 a-1 for basalt. The best suited locations are warm and humid areas, particularly in India, Brazil, South-East Asia and China, where almost 75% of the global potential can be realized. This work presents a techno-economic assessment framework, which also allows for the incorporation of further processes. Â© 2018 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

The shipping industry underwent a tremendous growth during the last century (from 2.6 billion tons annual shipments in 1970 to 9.2 billion tons annual shipments in 2012). The industrial revolution and unrestricted transcontinental trade have catalyzed the global trade volume. Nowadays; merchant ships, approximately 50,000 in number, are sailing across the globe to deliver cargoes of various kinds. On the other hand, the shipping industry is also responsible for a notable amount of total CO2 emissions and several other harmful air pollutants such as Sulfur Oxides, Nitrogen Oxides and Particulate Matter. It may, however, be noted that shipping continues to remain a better environmental option for commercial transportation compared to other available means due to lowest gCO2/ton.km emissions. There is indeed an unrelenting requirement for further improvements in energy efficiency and emissions reduction in the shipping industry as global shipping volume is predicted to continue growing significantly in future. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has been vigorously seeking for new measures for further improvements in energy efficiency and emissions reduction, and swift implementation of these measures to reduce the harmful emissions from international shipping. A major improvement in fuel efficiency and significant reductions in harmful emissions from ships has been achieved over the past decades through improved powering technologies and increasing energy-efficiency of engine and propulsion systems. These technologies can be divided into three major groups, i.e., machinery options, propeller efficiency options and alternate powering options. In this chapter; a comprehensive overview of these green ship technologies is presented which includes basic concepts, principles and potential, related core issues and possible solutions.

AB  - The feasibility of the Northern Sea Route is assessed for seasonal operations of oil product tankers using alternative fuel types. A speed optimisation model is used that minimises the required freight rate (RFR) of a Long Range 2 (LR2) tanker against alternative routes. A cost model is developed that incorporates real hourly speed data from tanker voyages between the 2011 and 2019 summer/autumn seasons, and primary and secondary data regarding cost and operational factors. The analysis is based on naphtha and jet fuel/kerosene trades between Europe and Asia. A prospective ban on the use of High Sulphur Fuel Oil (HSFO) in the Arctic, and alternative fuels, such as the new Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO) and Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) are included to take into account of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) 2020 global sulphur limit and its long-term strategy towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - This paper discusses the AC fault ride through of two terminal modular multilevel converter (MMC) VSC based HVDC integration of combined offshore wind and wave farms. The combined offshore wind and wave farms are modelled as a controllable three phase voltage source connected to a 600MVA, 460kV/370kV transformer. A 31- level MMC has been selected because of acceptable harmonic attributes. Two 300kV DC submarine cables with length of 100km have been employed in this study. A voltage source has been connected in series with an inductive resistive circuit to give a short circuit ratio of 3.5. This paper finally presents a comparative simulation analysis of hysteresis based and PI based DC voltage controller for fault ride through (FRT) capability. The analysis showed that the PI method resulted in smaller overshoots and dips. A high switching frequency PWM based electromagnetic transient (EMT) model in MATLAB/Simulink was developed for the analysis. Â© 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Wave Energy Converters (WECs) have excellent potential as a source of renewable energy that is yet to be commercially realised. Recent attention has been focused on the installation of Oscillating Water Column (OWC) devices as part of breakwaters or harbour walls to provide advantages of cost-sharing structures and proximity of power generation facilities to existing infrastructure. In this paper, a time-domain numerical model of a fixed Multi-Chamber Oscillating Water Column (MC-OWC) is developed in MATLAB. This model is validated against a scale model experiments performed in a wave flume and good agreement is found. The validated model is used to investigate the effect of the power take-off damping on device performance parameters for a given environmental condition.

TI  - Velocity measurements in reservoir rock samples from the SACROC unit using various pore fluids, and integration into a seismic survey taken before and after a CO2 sequestration flood
JO  - NANA
PY  - 2009
VL  - 1
IS  - 1
AB  - The SACROC field, located in west Texas in the Permian Basin, is the oldest CO2 enhanced oil recovery site in the United States, with over 93 million tons of CO2 injected as of 2007. Recently, the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) of the United States Department of Energy has begun to support an enhanced oil recovery project at the SACROC field in north central Texas, working in close collaboration with the Bureau of Economic Geology in Austin, Texas. The project requires the injection of CO2 at a depth of approximately 2040 meters into a reef structure. This project involves both repeat reflection seismic surveys and rock physics based analysis of core material. In the SACROC field, hydrocarbons were flooded out using water, and will be flooded with liquid CO2 during the summer of 2008. An experiment is planned whereby we first image fluid floods through reservoir rock using a CT scanner at NETL in order to see what the residual saturations of the previous fluids are. We then plan to conduct velocity measurements in this order, so that we can obtain a good estimate of conditions in different parts of the reservoir. We will then measure the P and S wave velocities, porosity, and permeability at varying pressures and temperatures that simulate reservoir conditions after each successive flood. In addition to velocity measurements, we will measure porosity, permeability, Young's Modulus, Poisson's ratio, and stress and strain measurement under simulated in situ reservoir conditions. Preliminary P and S wave velocity measurements were made in dry Berea sandstone samples in order to have a base reference material to compare our results to. Our Berea measurements were 2402 m/s for Vp, 1688 m/s for Vs, and 0.703 for Vs/Vp for an unstressed sample, which agrees well with the literature. The measured velocities, the P and S waveforms, the velocity vs. confining pressure will be used to calibrate our acoustical measurements both in dry and saturated samples of the carbonate SACROC reservoir rock using oil, gas, water, and CO2. We then plan on doing the first of several seismic surveys in the SACROC field in west Texas. The first survey will be completed during the summer of 2008, and presented at this meeting. Using our velocity measurements, we hope to be able to discern the difference between areas of the reservoir rock that are saturated with different pore-filling phases. With repeated surveys over the next few years, we hope to be able to observe the area of extent of various floods of CO2 that are scheduled to be injected into several wells in the area using the laboratory measurements we collected.

TI  - A Novel Big Data Collection System for Ship Energy Efficiency Monitoring and Analysis Based on BeiDou System
JO  - Journal Of Advanced Transportation
PY  - 2021
VL  - 2021
IS  - NA
AB  - The call for green shipping is increasing, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from ships becomes more and more important. Traditional ship energy efficiency monitoring is based on the noon reports, which are susceptible to human error and have a time delay. Many ship energy efficiency monitoring systems have been designed and developed, but they usually cannot send data to the shore in time. In order to identify abnormal fuel consumption in time, this paper realizes a big data collection system for ship energy efficiency monitoring based on the BeiDou System. The system installed on two sister container ships has already collected a lot of data. Big data analysis methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation analysis, are applied in the system to realize data visualization and analysis. Using PCA, it turns out that the shaft power of the main engine is related to a certain ship speed, which is also affected by load and weather conditions, and is the biggest factor in determining fuel consumption. To realize the assessment of hull fouling and the optimization of ship trim, a useful physics-based analysis is proposed. The analysis shows that the fouling of ship body greatly increases its resistance. Our analysis method can also find the best trim under specific loading condition. All these points are important for reducing fuel consumption and improving ship efficiency.

AB  - Wave energy is a renewable and pollution-free energy source that has a potential world-wide contribution to the electricity market estimated in the order of 2,000 TWh/year, which represents about 10\% of the world's electricity consumption with an investment cost of EUR 820 billion. Sea waves have one of the highest energy densities among the Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Today, the largest problem in harvesting wave energy is obtaining reliability of the technology and bringing the cost down. The main types of wave energy converters are: - The oscillating water column, which consists of a partially submerged, hollow structure open to the sea below the water line. - Overtopping devices that collect the water of incident waves in order to drive one or more low head turbines. - Point absorbers (floating or mounted on the sea bed), which usually provide a heave motion that is converted by mechanical, magnetic and/or hydraulic systems in linear or rotational motion for driving electrical generators. -Surging devices that exploit the horizontal particle velocity in a wave to drive a deflector or to generate the pumping effect of a flexible bag facing the wave front. Obviously the amount of available energy depends on the different distribution of the wave energy on the world coastlines. The most energetic sites are situated on the west coasts of the oceans at middle latitudes. European and Australian west coasts reach amounts of 80 kW/m of available wave energy; in fact, the first ``wave farms{''} have been installed in Portugal and Scotland where the energy due to the waves reaches these highest values. The power in a wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude and to the period of the motion. Therefore, long period (>7-10 s), large amplitude (>2 m) waves have energy fluxes commonly averaging between 40 and 70 kW per m width of oncoming wave. Situated at the end of the long, stormy fetch of the Atlantic, the wave climate along the western coast of Europe is characterized by particularly high energy. In the Mediterranean basin, the annual power level off the coasts of the European countries varies between 4 and 11 kW/m, the highest values occurring in the area of the south-western Aegean Sea. In the Thyrrenian Sea, this lowest value of 4 kW/m is acceptable as a limit for possible location of an offshore wave farm. In order to identify the best sites and to optimize the location of new wave farms offshore of the coastlines of the Campania region (South of Italy), the significant wave height data set of ISPRA has been used, on which the Italian Wave Atlas is based. The wave buoys data are useful to calibrate the wave prediction model WWIII implemented by the Department of Applied Sciences of the University Parthenope, which simulates the most significant wave storm events of the last ten years. This procedure has been used to produce in the recent past a risk assessment of the Campanian coastlines to the wave impact, so it can also be used to evaluate the potential wave energy to be converted offshore of the Campanian coasts.

AB  - Even though shipping is one of the most efficient methods of transport in terms of carbon produced per ton-mile, it is the target of major carbon reduction efforts. Shipping accounts for âˆ¼ 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions which is likely to double by 2050. And as only 30-31% of marine fuel is used to power the vessel, technology will be the crucial factor in reducing these emissions. A discussion on bunkering and fuel testing covers Intertanko's call to the IMO to set target levels for the energy efficiency of new ships; possibility that lMO will regulate shipping by setting its own targets; risks associated with carrying different grades of fuel; drivers for fuel oil testing; concerns on wear to equipment and machinery; monitoring wear; optimizing lubricant feed rate; troubleshooting using online tools and technology; testing marine fuel for H2S content; and Shell's tests using GTL gasoil as a replacement for marine gasoil in a Caterpillar Marine auxiliary engine.

JO  - Southern Forests-a Journal Of Forest Science
PY  - 2021
VL  - 83
IS  - 3
AB  - Mangroves are recognised as an important carbon sequester and therefore demand accurate biomass and carbon stock estimations. This study aimed to develop additive biomass models for Heritiera fomes, the most dominant tree species of the Sundarbans Reserved Forest in Bangladesh. Using a non-destructive method, 219 small branches (diameter < 7 cm) were harvested from 97 individual trees to develop biomass models for leaves and smaller branches. The biomass of bigger branches (diameter > 7 cm) and stem was calculated from the volume and mean wood density value after debarking while the biomass of all other components was derived from the determined fresh to oven dry weight conversion ratio. Finally, the biomass of one individual tree was calculated by adding the biomass of trimmed and untrimmed leaves, small and large branches, foliage and stem. An independent data set was used to validate the best-fit model. A component-wise (leaves, branches, bark and stem) biomass model was developed by recovering subsequent cross-component correlations which were then aggregated using the weighted Gaussian maximum likelihood estimation method. Among the components model, D (diameter at breast height) alone performed best for leaves and branches while the product of D and H (total tree height) proved the better results for stem and bark. Our best-fit model (Biomass = 0.0389D(2.3773) H-0.4178 + 0.0492D(2.3027) + 0.0112D(1.1144) H-1.4572 + 0.0306D(1.8507)) showed the highest model efficiency with the lowest AIC, RMSE\%, MAE, and MPE values. The efficiency of our non-destructive model has shown that it is as effective as other widely used pan-tropical models. Our built models can therefore be used for accurate estimation of biomass and carbon stock in H. fomes of the Sundarbans Reserved Forest, Bangladesh.

TI  - Optimizing power generation of a bottomraised oscillating surge wave energy converter using a theoretical model
JO  - Proceedings Of The European Wave And Tidal Energy Conference
PY  - 2021
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Preliminary sizing of an oscillating surge wave energy converter (OSWEC) is an iterative process that relies on knowledge of the relevant hydrodynamic coefficients for a given geometry. Often, the complex definition of the device geometry requires coefficients to be obtained through experiments or numerical boundary element solvers such as WAMIT. These techniques demand significant user and computational effort, therefore inhibiting the fine-scale parametrization of object dimensions. In this study, a theoretical model, originally presented in Michele et al. (2016), is developed and demonstrated to efficiently optimize the power production for an OSWEC device (subjected to certain environmental conditions) with variations in device widths, heights, and distances from the seabed. Assuming negligible device thickness, the OSWEC motions are modeled as a bottomraised two-dimensional flap in regular waves using potential flow theory formulated in elliptical coordinates. The solutions to this diffraction-radiation problem are obtained using Mathieu functions with appropriate boundary conditions. The resulting potentials are then used to derive frequency-dependent expressions for the added mass and radiation-damping coefficients, along with waveexcitation magnitude in surge, pitch, and coupled surgepitch motions. Good agreement in hydrodynamic coefficient curves is shown between the theoretical model and the numerical results obtained from the boundary element-based program WAMIT. The theoretical model is then employed to maximize the time-averaged output power while maintaining or reducing the hinge reaction force, with variations in device dimensions, wave frequency, and amplitude.

AB  - Multi-body wave energy converter is being considered to be one of harvest technologies to maximize the potential to extract the renewable source of energy from the ocean. The key issues in this field are to understand the interaction between bodies; and develop the awareness of how to utilize the impact of these. This paper describes a set of numerical simulations designed to investigate the optimum configuration of a simple two-body point absorber device. Deep-water condition is applied and regular surface waves are used to describe the ocean waves. The single point-absorber system is modeled as two independently moving bodies connected to a direct driven linear generator and the generator is simplified as a spring-damping system. The results confirm that the ability to extract energy depends on the mass and geometry of the moving parts, together with the damping of generator. It is also demonstrated that the outcome is sensitive to the distance between the two moving bodies and local wave condition. Â© 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

AB  - The thermodynamic characteristics of a combined cycle applied with a topping cycle such as a trilateral cycle at relatively high temperatures and a bottoming cycle such as an organic Rankine cycle at relatively low temperatures have been theoretically investigated. This is an electric generation system used to recover the waste heat of the exhaust gas from a diesel engine used for the propulsion of a large ship. As a result, when the boundary temperature between the topping and the bottoming cycles increased, the system efficiencies of energy and exergy were simultaneously maximized because the total exergy destruction rate (Â£Ed) and exergy loss (Â£) decreased, respectively. In the case of a marine diesel engine, the waste heat recovery electric generation system can be utilized for additional propulsion power, and the propulsion efficiency was found to be improved by an average of 9.17 % according to the engine load variation, as compared to the case with only the base engine. In this ease, the specific fuel consumption and specific C02 emission of the diesel engine were reduced by an average of 8.4% and 8.37%, respectively.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems sequester and store large amounts of carbon in both biomass and soil. In this study, species diversity, the above and below-ground biomass as well as carbon stock by the mangroves in Kanhlyashay natural mangrove forest were estimated. Six true mangrove species from four families were recorded in the sample plots of the study area. Among them, Avicennia officinalis L. from the Acanthaceae family was the abundance of species with an importance value of 218.69%. Shannonâ€“Wienerâ€™s diversity index value (Hâ€² = 0.71) of the mangrove community was very low compared to other natural mangrove forests since the mangrove stands in the study site possessed a low number of mangrove species and were dominated by a few species. Estimated mean biomass was 335.55 Â± 181.41 Mg haâˆ’1 (AGB = 241.37 Â± 132.73 Mg haâˆ’1, BGB = 94.17 Â± 48.73 Mg haâˆ’1). The mean overall C-stock of the mangrove stand was 150.25 Â± 81.35 Mg C haâˆ’1 and is equivalent to 551.10 Â± 298.64 Mg CO2 eq. The role of forests in climate change is two-fold as a cause and a solution for greenhouse gas emissions. The result of the study demonstrated that the mangroves in Letkhutkon village have high carbon storage potential, therefore it is necessary to be sustainably managed to maintain and increase carbon storage. Climate change mitigation may be achieved not only by reducing the carbon emission levels but also by maintaining the mangrove ecosystem services as carbon sinks and sequestration.

JO  - Ocean Engineering

AB  - Energy saving and emission reduction have attracted a great deal of attention in the maritime industry. The optimization of a ship's energy efficiency can reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions effectively. However, most of the available studies only focus on either the sailing speed or route optimization, and the interaction between speed and route under the influence of multiple environmental factors was not accounted properly. In this paper, a novel joint optimization method of the sailing route and speed, which considers the interaction between route and speed as well as multiple environmental factors, is proposed to fully exploit the energy efficiency's potential. Moreover, a joint optimization model of the sailing route and speed, which is based on an energy consumption model that considers multiple environmental factors, is established. Next, a solution algorithm for the joint optimization model is investigated in order to achieve joint decision-making with regard to the sailing route and speed. Finally, a case study is conducted that demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can achieve the optimal sailing route and speed under complex environmental conditions, as well as a reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of about 4\%.

AB  - Offshore renewable energies have been identified as important clean sources of energy in line with sustainable development goals. However, their use can generate conflicts with other maritime activities, as well as the protection of biodiversity and the marine environment. This article analyses the influence of regulatory frameworks and ocean governance in the implementation of such devices, from a legalâ€“political point of view. In this sense, it studies how the law of the sea addresses potential international conflicts between ocean energy installations and other activities (e.g., navigation) developed by other states. It also studies the importance of preventive legal toolsâ€”marine spatial planning, strategic environmental assessment, and environmental impact assessmentâ€”to anticipate and reduce clashes with other sea users as well as environmental damages that may be caused by these structures. Likewise, this research analyses different national consent procedures and legalâ€“economic supporting schemes, to identify those that boost the implementation of such projects more quickly. Finally, the relevance of enhancing the involvement of affected coastal communities and local stakeholders in the decision-making processes, as well as in the socio-economic benefits of offshore renewable energy projects to increase their social acceptance, is also emphasized.

TI  - Total life cycle emissions of post-Panamax containerships powered by conventional fuel or natural gas
JO  - Journal Of The Air \& Waste Management Association
PY  - 2019
VL  - 69
IS  - 2
AB  - This study proposes an easy-to-apply method, the Total Life Cycle Emission Model (TLCEM), to calculate the total emissions from shipping and help ship management groups assess the impact on emissions caused by their capital investment or operation decisions. Using TLCEM, we present the total emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases (GHGs) during the 25-yr life cycle of 10 post-Panamax containerships under slow steaming conditions. The life cycle consists of steel production, shipbuilding, crude oil extraction and transportation, fuel refining, bunkering, and ship operation. We calculate total emissions from containerships and compare the effect of emission reduction by using various fuels. The results can be used to differentiate the emissions from various processes and to assess the effectiveness of various reduction approaches. Critical pollutants and GHGs emitted from each process are calculated. If the containerships use heavy fuel oil (HFO), emissions of CO2 total 2.79 million tonnes (Mt), accounting for 95.37\% of total emissions, followed by NOx and SOx emissions,which account for 2.25\% and 1.30\%, respectively.The most significant emissions are from the operation of the ship and originate from the main engine (ME).When fuel is switched to 100\% natural gas (NG), SOx, PM10, and CO2 emissions show remarkable reductions of 98.60\%, 99.06\%, and 21.70\%, respectively. Determining the emission factor of each process is critical for estimating the total emissions. The estimated emission factors were compared with the values adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).The proposed TLCEM may contribute to more accurate estimates of total life cycle emissions from global shipping.Implications: We propose a total life cycle emissions model for 10 post-Panamax container ships. Using heavy fuel oil, emissions of CO2 total 2.79 Mt, accounting for approximately 95\% of emissions, followed by NOx and SOx emissions. Using 100\% natural gas, SOx, PM10, and CO2 emissions reduce by 98.6\%, 99.1\%, and 21.7\%, respectively. NOx emissions increase by 1.14\% when running a dual fuel engine at low load in natural gas mode.

AB  - As one of the important ecosystem services of wetlands, carbon sequestration of lakes and swamps in China were investigated in this paper. Based on the reported bulk density and total organic carbon content, we estimated the carbon sequestration rate of major lakes and swamps regions in China. The carbon sequestration capacity of lakes of the whole country was 1981.87GgC Â· a-1. Lakes in East China exhibited the highest carbon sequestration rate and the greatest carbon sequestration capacity. Swamps demonstrated a total higher carbon sequestration of 4.9lTgC, 1.47 times greater than that of lakes in China. Among the five varieties of swamps, mangrove had the highest carbon sequestration rate of 444.27 gC Â· m-2Â· a-1, while the inland marsh was of the greatest carbon sequestration capacity, the amount was 1501.12 GgC a-1. Wetlands reclamation led to huge amount of carbon emission, and the carbon loss due to reclamation of lakes and swamps were 0.82 and 26.9Tg, respectively. After the great flood in 1998, wetlands recovery policies such as returning farms to lakes and swamps were implemented. The carbon sequestration potential of wetlands recovery was 30.48GgC Â·a-1, including 30.26GgC Â· a-1 from returning farms to lakes and 0.22GgC Â· a-1 from returning farms to swamps. Under the ongoing National Wetland Conservation Action Plan, the carbon sequestration potential of wetland restoration was estimated at 6.57GgC Â· a-1. Accordingly, wetland protection and restoration can improve the carbon sequestration potential of wetlands.

AB  - Harnessing ocean wave energy is an old challenge that has gained momentum in recent years. In this paper, we present the flow and electrical characterization of a prototype of an alternate liquid metal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator at a laboratory scale which has the potential to make use of the energy of marine waves for its conversion into electrical energy. The eutectic alloy Galinstan, used as a working fluid, was driven in oscillatory motion in a duct of a rectangular cross-section exposed to a transverse magnetic field generated by permanent neodymium magnets. The electric current induced by the motion of the liquid metal in the magnetic field was collected through copper electrodes and delivered to the load. The oscillatory axial velocity component along the duct was measured using ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry for different oscillation frequencies. In turn, the output currents and voltages were measured for different operation conditions and the electric power and efficiency were estimated from experimental measurements. The coupling of this generator to a wave energy converter (WEC) is discussed.

AB  - Effluents from desalination technologies may influence natural bacterial assemblages due to changes in salinity, pH, dissolved organic carbon concentration (DOC), DOC quality and cellular hydrostatic pressure. Salinity, pH, and pressure change effects on heterotrophic bacterial production (as measured by leucine incorporation) were examined in experiments with surface water from the Delaware Bay, Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean. Bacterial production decreased by 57-67\% when salinity of Atlantic Ocean and Delaware Bay surface water samples were increased from ambient to 60 PSU. Decreasing ambient seawater pH from 8.0 to below 5.0 with CO2 gas reduced production by 96-100\%. Decreasing seawater pH by 1.5 units at 33 PSU caused equivalent inhibition to increasing salinity by 27 PSU (pH 8.0). Bacterial production in Pacific Ocean surface water pressurized for 72 h was decreased 40\% by increasing salinity, when measured I h after decompression. However, production increased 43\% with increasing salinity when, measured 24 h after decompression. One explanation for these divergent effects between the 1- and 24-h sampling at ambient pH may be community adaptation. Strains amongst the natural assemblage that survived the pressurization by saturating their membrane phospholipids would likely be better adapted to compete for available nutrients under elevated salinity.

PY  - 2008
VL  - 2
IS  - 4, SI
AB  - Large-scale injections Of CO2 into subsurface saline aquifers have been proposed to remediate climate change related to buildup of green house gases in the atmosphere. The pressure buildup caused by such injections may impact a volume of the basin significantly larger than the CO2 plume itself In areas with hydrological settings similar to the Gulf Coast Basin, the perturbation of the flow-field in deep parts of the basin could result in brines or brackish water being pushed up-dip into unconfined sections of the same formations or into the capture zone of fresh-water wells. The premise of the current study is that the details of multiple-phase flow processes necessary to model the near field evolution of the CO2 plume are not necessary to describe the impact of the pressure anomaly on up-dip aquifers. This paper quantitatively explores conditions under which shallow groundwater would be impacted by up-dip displacement of brines, utilizing an existing carefully calibrated flow model. Modeling an injection of water, arguably equivalent to 50 million tons of CO2/year for 50 years resulted in an average water-table rise of similar to 1 in, with minor increase in stream baseflow and larger increase in ground water evapotranspiration, but no significant change in salinity.

TI  - Energy efficiency and fuel changes to reduce environmental impacts
JO  - Shipping And The Environment: Improving Environmental Performance In Marine Transportation
PY  - 2016
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Many different emissions from ships are directly related to a ship's fuel consumption. This is particularly true for emissions to air, which are generated during the combustion process in the engines. Hence, improving the conversion process from fuel energy to transport work can be an effective means of reducing ship emissions. Solutions for reducing ship fuel consumption are generally divided into design and operational measures. Design measures primarily include technical solutions implemented when the ship is designed, constructed, and retrofitted, such as weightreduction, hull coatings, air lubrication, improvement of hull design, optimal propulsion systems and harvesting waste energy. Operational measures are related to how the ship or the fleet is operated and include measures such as weather routing, optimal ship scheduling, improved ship logistics, and on-board energy management. Although reducing fuel consumption always generates an environmental benefit, it should be noted that the use of different fuels results in different impacts on the environment for a given energy conversion efficiency. Another way to reduce emissions is therefore related to the type of fuel used on a ship, e.g., diesel fuels, gases, alcohols and solid fuels. However, choosing a fuel is not an easy process because it is influenced by a broad range of criteria, including technical, environmental and economic criteria.

AB  - The Energy Systems Research Unit within the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Strathclyde has developed a novel contra-rotating tidal turbine (CoRMaT). Novel aspects of this turbine include two contra-rotating sets of rotor blades directly driving an open-to-sea permanent magnet generator (PMG). The balancing of reactive forces by the use of contra-rotation enables the use of a single-point compliant mooring system for station keeping. A series of tank and sea tests have led to the deployment and demonstration of a small stand-alone next generation tidal turbine. The stability of a single-point mooring system is examined and power quality from the direct drive generator is evaluated. It is noted that good stability from a single-point mooring can be achieved within a real tidal stream; however from sea testing of the turbine off the west coast of Scotland in the Sound of Islay, it is shown that some instabilities in device station keeping may have an effect on the output electrical power quality. Finally, the scaling up of the power take-off and delivery options for a 250 kW production prototype are described and assessed. It was concluded that the most promising option was an enlarged version of the system already tested, namely a direct-drive contra-rotating PMG.

JO  - International Journal Of Energy Research
PY  - 2021
VL  - 45
IS  - 2
AB  - Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) can supply backup power for a remote island microgrid that generates power from tidal energy, photovoltaics (PV), and wind turbines. Since SOFCs need high temperature operation, though, the possible output adjustments are relatively slow. Therefore, SOFC with renewable energy requires the electricity compensation by a storage battery. This paper reports the analysis results using MATLAB/Simulink 2016b simulations of a microgrid with tidal energy, photovoltaics, and SOFC generators. The dynamic characteristics of the modeled SOFC are estimated from experimental tests of a product in Japan, and the suitable battery capacity for such a microgrid is determined. Furthermore, proposed system stores surplus electricity using a hydrogen energy carrier, energy supply can be carried out only in renewable energy. The remote tropical islands of Ternate and Pulau-Tidore served as a case study area for the proposed microgrid. Proposed microgrid for a remote island was modeled using MATLAB/Simulink 2016b. The simulations clarified the suitable combination of tidal power generation, PV, and SOFC capacity assuming a maximum load. The required capacity of a Li-ion storage battery in the example case of Indonesia's remote Ternate and Pulau-Tidore Island needs to be 3.2% of the maximum hourly load if the maximum load on the microgrid is 1200 kW.

TI  - LNG COLD ENERGY POTENTIAL FOR CONTAINER SHIP AND FERRY
JO  - Motor Ship
PY  - 2020
VL  - 101
IS  - 1183
AB  - WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤â€™s patented cold energy recovery system has demonstrated operational savings on the LNG-fuelled ferry Viking Grace by reducing the amount of electricity consumed in HVAC system cooling compressors. To further improve, a new study from Denmark looks beyond that to the potential of LNG cold energy for vessels with dual-fuel engines. Main engine exhaust gases, jacket cooling water, seawater and an intermediate glycol-water system for HVAC cooling were considered as heat sources for the ORC unit. The maximum power output was obtained using butane as the working fluid for the seawater and glycolwater configurations, iso-pentane for jacket water and n-pentane for engine exhaust gases. The savings attainable when using the LNG cold energy to further cool engine scavenge air (to increase engine efficiency and reduce NOx emissions) were highly dependent on relative air humidity. High humidity meant that up to 39% of the heat was used to condense the water vapor rather than to cool the air in tropical conditions. The estimated fuel savings under ISO conditions (ambient temperature of 25Â°C and relative humidity of 30%) ranged from 0.41% to 0.44%. The system combines thermal energy storage with a waste heat recovery system based on ORC technology, and it was evaluated for a hypothetical ferry requiring 1MW of auxiliary power. The results suggest that the proposed system could reduce CO2 emissions by 8% and could be economically competitive with the installation of battery systems to supply power during port stays, especially for newbuilds.

AB  - To understand, mitigate and reduce the detrimental effects on human health and the environment from exhaust gas emissions from ships it is necessary to be able to estimate the quantity and location of these ship emissions in time. Currently, the two most commonly used ship emission assessment methods sit on opposite ends of the spectrum â€“ the top-down approach, which provides low resolution yet efficient aggregated results however is unable to account for specific shipping activities, and the bottom-up vessel-by-vessel approach, which provides near-instantaneous ship emissions production at a high resolution â€“ yet is data and time intensive. To address the market gap for a ship greenhouse emission estimation method that hybridises the best of both the bottom-up and top-down methods the novel Ship Emissions Assessment (SEA) method is proposed as an innovative hybrid solution. It is a cost effective and resource efficient method, presenting spatial ship emissions utilising widely accessible data, and it is precise â€“ fulfilling the requirements needed to evaluate ship emissions reduction measures. Novel SEA method is the first in its endeavour to replace Automatic Identification System (AIS) Vessel-based raw data allocation, by using rapid analyses of readily available ship track density data and average voyage information. It combines obtained average voyage distance with voyage average speed to estimate ship activity for emission assessments - saving costs by reducing time and reliance on complex computations, especially when many ships need to be analysed simultaneously. Using the novel SEA method, a series of containerships from geographically diverse ports were sampled and assessed for emissions with comparative results confirming the representations equivalent to the detailed and data demanding bottom-up method. Subsequently, the novel SEA method was applied to containership traffic calling into the Port of Trieste, in the northern Adriatic Sea, where it demonstrated the ability to estimate and quantify historic emissions for the preceding 12 months while taking into account seasonal port traffic variations. The novel SEA method showed to be an efficient, inexpensive and accurate, easy-to-use emission assessment tool based on widely accessible data. It can be used in day-to-day shipping operations by a variety of stakeholders including port operations managers, regional traffic operators, and those non-industry, while providing the required level of technical accuracy. In comparison, existing methods are not as time and cost effective, user-friendly, nor based on easy to interpret and readily accessible data. The novel SEA method enables further global research of ship emissions, and for regional and international policy makers to effectively manage the measures needed to reach greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.

Tier III, which will be introduced in 2016, will require a very significant reduction of 80% compared with current level. To allow compliance with IMO sulfur and SOx requirements, IMO has also worked out a three-step approach for reducing the sulfur content of fuel used on ocean-going ships from the current 4.5 to 3.5% in 2012 and 0.5% in 2020. Turbocharging and engine emissions reduction are also presented. Miller timing are used to reduce NOx emissions, which means that significantly higher pressure ratios are needed.

AB  - Integrating innovative solutions for ship design has always been a great challenge for the maritime sector due to complex design and construction processes. With this scenario in mind, the objective of this study was to develop a procedure to evaluate the potential benefits arising from the integration of innovative light-weight structures in ship hull structural design. To achieve such an objective, a hybrid light-weight ship hull structural design solution, in which aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels were used to build the conventional steel inner side shell of the cargo holds, was adopted for a bulk carrier. The authors of this study used a multiple criteria decision-making approach. An optimal ship hull structural design solution was identified based on capital cost, voyage cost, annual cost, energy efficiency design index, dismantlingâ€“reselling cost, cargo transportation, energy consumption and carbon footprint. The optimal solution, identified with the multiple criteria decision-making approach, improved the shipâ€™s efficiency and costs by combining the hybrid structural design with efficient cargo transportation. In addition, using recycled aluminium was found to be a promising strategy to reduce the energy consumption and carbon footprint related to the shipbuilding process. Â© 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The energy and the exergy performance of a dual-loop Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), which harvests exhaust heat from a two-stroke slow-speed main marine diesel engine of a bulk carrier is examined herein. An energy analysis is adopted to calculate the energy flows to the components of the high-temperature (HT) and the low-temperature (LT) loops of the bottoming ORC and through them, to calculate the energy efficiency of the ORC and the generated power from both expanders. Also, an exergy analysis is implemented to predict the irreversibility rates of the components of both HT and LT loops of the ORC system. Various organic fluids are examined for the HT and the LT ORC loops and the optimum combination is selected based on the results of a parametric analysis. The effect of ambient conditions on the energetic and exergetic performance of the dual-loop ORC is examined. The energy analysis of the bottoming dual-loop ORC is projected to a specific mission operational profile of a bulk carrier for predicting the benefits in fuel cost saving and CO2 and SO2 emission reduction compared to conventional vessel operation.

AB  - In this paper technical and economic feasibility study of hybrid system with storage for a fishing village in the southern Moroccan coastline is carried out. The village under study can stand for most fishing villages of the area of southern Moroccan coastline. Since these villages might not have easy access to the national electricity grid, their energy needs are ensured by highly polluting generators with high energy generation cost in the long term. One of the solutions for decreasing power systems energy cost in these villages is installation of hybrid energy systems. In order to comprehend the viability of such systems, a pilot site was chosen: Lamhiriz, a small village of 4625 inhabitants with an annual consumption of 1.3 GWh. The new power system investigated for Lamhiriz village is diesel-wind hybrid system with electrochemical and thermal storages. First, energy consumption and wind potential of Lamhiriz are presented, then it comes the design of the hybrid system that was approached in two ways: a first configuration of the hybrid system is obtained by economical simulation on HOMER software. In a second step, the sizing problem is solved as an optimization problem where we try to minimize the cost of energy generated by each element of the system in order to meet the electrical demand. Once the optimum sizing obtained, the appropriate energy management is chosen. The GAMS software was used to approach the optimal sizing and energy management. The results found by both HOMER and GAMS are compared in order to see the one meeting the expectations of an optimized system. Energy cost results brought by the optimized hybrid system is compared with energy cost brought by a conventional diesel system. Â© 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Wetlands are highly productive ecosystem with great potential to store carbon (C) and retain nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in their soil. Changes in vegetation type and land use can affect organic matter inputs and soil properties. This work aimed to examine how these changes affected elemental stoichiometry and C-, N-, and P- associated enzyme activities and wetland soil organic C stock. We quantified organic C concentrations, and stoichiometric ratios of C, N, and P in total and microbial biomass pools, along with the activities and ratios of C-, N-, and P-associated enzymes for soils of natural coastal wetlands with different vegetation types, namely Melaleuca wetland (Melaleuca spp), mangrove forests (Bruguiera spp), and saline marsh (Eleocharis spp). We also compared these natural wetlands to an adjacent sugarcane plantation to understand the effects of vegetation types. Hypothesis-oriented path analysis was used to explore links between these variables and soil organic C stocks. Tidal forested soils (0â€“30 cm) had the highest organic C, N, and P contents and potential activities of C-, N-, P- acquiring enzymes, compared with other vegetation types. Mangroves soils had the highest total soil C:N and microbial biomass C:P ratios. Microbial biomass C:P ratios were significantly and positively related to total C:P, while microbial biomass N:P ratios were positively associated with total soil C:P and N:P ratios. Path analysis suggested that soil organic C stock was largely explained by total C:P ratio, microbial biomass N:P ratios, total P content, and the ratio of C- and P-associated enzymes. Different types of wetlands have different soil properties and enzymatic activities, implying their different capacity to store and process C and N. The resource quality and stoichiometry direct influence the organic C stock. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd
