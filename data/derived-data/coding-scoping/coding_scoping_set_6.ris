TI  - The Influence of Economic Barriers and Drivers on Energy Efficiency Investments in Maritime Shipping, from the Perspective of the Principal-Agent Problem

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 19
AB  - Maritime transport stands out as a strategic sector; the increasing trend in maritime traffic makes it essential to reduce energy consumption and emissions through investment in energy efficiency. However, investments can be hindered by barriers, and drivers are necessary to reduce or overcome them and promote investment. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to analyze what factors influence investment decisions-and how they do so-when there are principal-agent problems in the shipowner-charterer relationship. The methodology is based on the following process: model and hypotheses formulation, variable definition, the creation of a study sample and statistical treatment through a descriptive analysis of variables and a binomial logistic regression model, all based on a state-of-the-art application. The results corroborate the hypotheses and indicate that principal-agent problems and split incentives, especially in time charter contracts, and a lack of verified information make the shipowners less likely to invest. Moreover, energy efficiency measures are less likely to be implemented in older vessels, possibly due to the difficulty associated with recovering the investment; they are more likely in larger and newer vessels, and regulation encourage their adoption. Furthermore, investment is more likely in vessels with verified information and high levels of both activity and harmful emissions. Improved knowledge in this field could help businesses and governments to act in a more sustainable manner, without detriment to an innovative and competitive sector.

AB  - With significant inroads being made in the electrification of land-based transport in recent years, there is an increased impetus on maritime transport as well for navigating towards cleaner fuels and reducing their emissions. However, the griddistant nature of marine vessels poses several challenges for their electrification not faced by their overland counterparts. This paper addresses some of these issues and outlines the role of power electronics in tackling them through onboard/onshore converters. Moreover, a hybrid energy interface feeding the ship's propulsion system and various loads is modeled and analyzed in a simulated environment wherein an intelligent control strategy is employed to optimize the use of onboard energy resources. Finally, some future trends are highlighted in the development of electric ships for making water transport emission-free. Â© 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange between the atmosphere and the Wadden Sea, a shallow coastal region along the northern Netherlands, has been measured from April 2006 onwards on a tidal flat and over open water. Tidal flat measurements were done using a flux chamber, and ship borne measurements using an equillbrator to determine the partial pressure of CO2 In the water. A strong response of CO2 exchange rate on Irradiance changes was observed at the tidal flat surface, with generally strong uptake of CO 2 during daylight conditions and release; presumably due to respiration, during dark conditions. the rate of respiration appeared to increase with temperature. Daytime CO2 uptake tended to be higher than nighttime release all year round. Apparently, tidal flats in temperate regions of the globe may be a sink for CO2 on an annual basis. In contrast to terrestrial CO2 exchange, uptake by processes active on and In tidal flats responds only slowly to changing irradiance. This Slow reaction Is attributed to CO2 storage In wet soli. Measurements In the water between tidal flats suggest that the estuarlne, open water part of the Wadden Sea Is a source of CO2 in spring. Â© 3007 IEEE.

AB  - In this study, an optimization method which couples a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) method and lifting line model interaction method is presented, and applied to design, for highest power output, horizontal axis marine current turbines in uniform inflow for different duct shapes. The flow around duct is solved by the RANS method, where the turbine blades are represented by a pressure drop as a function of radius, based on the lifting line model. An automated tool is developed to generate high-quality meshes for given duct shape and domain size. The present method is first applied to design unbounded ducted turbines and the effect of duct shapes (angle of attack, camber, chord length and thickness) on the power coefficient is studied. Then, ducted turbines placed in a cylindrical channel are designed by this method, built by a 3D printer and tested in a water flume.

AB  - This study examined the temporal and spatial patterns of carbon storage in an island-city by evaluation of soils across the entire urban and mangrove forests areas during dry, rainy and norths seasons of 2013-2014. The ecosystem service (mitigation of climatic change) was quantified and mapped on a wide scale in Carmen Island, Campeche, Mexico by using geo-statistics methods. Carbon sequestration rate and several important physicochemical parameters on a wide scale in the city were determined at 30 cm depth, which is the most relevant depth affected by land management practices. An evident seasonal pattern was observed for organic carbon, exhibiting its highest levels at the beginning of the dry season. In addition, a geographical distribution analysis identified mangrove and flooded sites as those zones in which carbon storage was higher, concluding that hydrogeology and dominant vegetation were the factors with a greater influence on carbon storage rate. Carbon storage rate obtained in this work (1.07 Kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) was comparable with those obtained for isolated and forested wetlands in others regions of the world. This study is the first in the region that provides a high-resolution map of soil carbon stocks in a mixed and complex frame where an important urban zone and mangrove forest co-exist.

AB  - In the modern shipboard power system, there is a growing concern about reduced fuel economy, efficiency improvement, and minimized emission in recent years. Besides, considering the islanded nature of the shipboard power system, ensuring the system reliability at both generation and load side is crucial. In this context, a hybrid medium voltage DC (MVDC) distribution system concept with diesel engine, PV system, and battery energy storage system (BESS) as the generators for the shipboard power system is proposed. Variable speed operation of a diesel engine is considered for the benefit of minimal specific fuel oil consumption (SFOC). Regarding the fault-tolerant characteristics of six-phase permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM), it is used for both generating and motoring application, thus maintaining system reliability at any time. A hierarchical control system is designed and implemented to ensure proper load power-sharing among the generators and to regulate the dc-link voltage of the proposed MVDC distribution system. To bolster the intent of minimal SFOC zone operation of diesel engines and coordination between the generators and load, a deterministic rule-based power management system is proposed and implemented. The simulation is carried out for potential operational modes of a cruise ship in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. Simulation results show that the proposed topological and control structure has satisfactory performance in terms of power delivery, stable dc-link dynamics, and overall system stability.

IS  - 1
AB  - The increase in Power Electronic (PE) converters due to the increase in offshore wind energy deployment have given rise to technical challenges (e.g., due to unprecedented fast dynamic phenomena) related to voltage and frequency stability in the power system. In the Offshore Wind Farms (OWFs), the currently available current injection-based voltage control for PE converters are not suitable for voltage control in PE dominated systems due to the absence of continuous voltage control and ineffectiveness during islanding. Moreover, in such power systems, the conventional controllers are not suitable for frequency control due to the absence of dynamic frequency control. The paper presents the Direct Voltage Control (DVC) strategy in a real-time environment to mitigate challenges related to voltage and frequency stability during islanding of OWFs. The control strategy is implemented in the average Electro-magnetic Transient (EMT) model of Type-4 Wind Generator (WG) in RSCAD(R) Version 5.011.1. It is compared with the benchmark model of the control strategy in DIgSILENT PowerFactory(TM) 2019 SP2 (x64) in EMT platform. The comparison based on short-term voltage stability and reactive current injection reveals that both the models provide similar results, confirming the validation of the RSCAD model. Moreover, the detailed representation of the converters in the RSCAD model provides a better depiction of the real-world operation.

PY  - 2017
VL  - 184
IS  - NA
AB  - The exotic cordgrass Spartina alterniflora has severely invaded the mangrove wetlands in southern China and ecological restoration using native mangroves was conducted in an attempt to control this invasive species. In this study, the contents and pools of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were quantified to investigate the invasive effects of S. alterniflora and then to evaluate whether the ecological restoration of native mangrove could reverse those effects. S. alterniflora only showed significantly higher organic carbon content in the surface 0â€“10 cm of soil than in the uninvaded mudflat. The high Î´13C values in the surface soil of the invaded habitat demonstrated that S. alterniflora contributed 42.6â€“62.2% of the organic carbon. The SOC for invasive S. alterniflora and newly restored mangroves (4 years and 14 years) was not enhanced in comparison to the unvegetated mudflat. S. alterniflora significantly increased the surface soil TN content, but decreased the available phosphorus content and TP density. The TN densities increased gradually with the mangrove restoration, while the TP densities were only slightly influenced. The results suggested that short-term invasion of S. alterniflora and subsequent mangrove restoration did not alter SOC or TN pool sizes, but S. alterniflora was shown to affect the potential carbon storage capacity produced by the mangroves in the Zhangjiang Estuary.

TI  - Sensitivity of simulated CO2 concentration to regridding of global fossil fuel CO2 emissions
JO  - Geoscientific Model Development
PY  - 2014
VL  - 7
IS  - 6
AB  - Errors in the specification or utilization of fossil fuel CO2 emissions within carbon budget or atmospheric CO2 inverse studies can alias the estimation of biospheric and oceanic carbon exchange. A key component in the simulation of CO2 concentrations arising from fossil fuel emissions is the spatial distribution of the emission near coastlines. Regridding of fossil fuel CO2 emissions (FFCO2) from fine to coarse grids to enable atmospheric transport simulations can give rise to mismatches between the emissions and simulated atmospheric dynamics which differ over land or water. For example, emissions originally emanating from the land are emitted from a grid cell for which the vertical mixing reflects the roughness and/or surface energy exchange of an ocean surface. We test this potential ``dynamical inconsistency{''} by examining simulated global atmospheric CO2 concentration driven by two different approaches to regridding fossil fuel CO2 emissions. The two approaches are as follows: (1) a commonly used method that allocates emissions to grid cells with no attempt to ensure dynamical consistency with atmospheric transport and (2) an improved method that reallocates emissions to grid cells to ensure dynamically consistent results. Results show large spatial and temporal differences in the simulated CO2 concentration when comparing these two approaches. The emissions difference ranges from -30.3 TgC grid cell(-1) yr(-1) (3.39 kgCm(-2) yr(-1)) to +30.0 TgC grid cell(-1) yr(-1) (+2.6 kgCm(-2) yr(-1)) along coastal margins. Maximum simulated annual mean CO2 concentration differences at the surface exceed +/- 6 ppm at various locations and times. Examination of the current CO2 monitoring locations during the local afternoon, consistent with inversion modeling system sampling and measurement protocols, finds maximum hourly differences at 38 stations exceed +/- 0.10 ppm with individual station differences exceeding 32 ppm. The differences implied by not accounting for this dynamical consistency problem are largest at monitoring sites proximal to large coastal urban areas and point sources. These results suggest that studies comparing simulated to observed atmospheric CO2 concentration, such as atmospheric CO2 inversions, must take measures to correct for this potential problem and ensure flux and dynamical consistency.

TI  - Ship Power Plant Decarbonisation Using Hybrid Systems and Ammonia Fuelâ€”A Techno-Economicâ€“Environmental Analysis

AB  - The shipping sector decarbonisation has attracted great attention due to the sector contribution to worldwide carbon emissions. This study aims at investigating the techno-economicâ€“environmental performance of different ship power plants to identify sustainable solutions for a case study cargo ship. Four scenarios, considering conventional and hybrid power plants, the latter with installed batteries, both using marine gas oil and ammonia fuels, are analysed to estimate the pertinent lifetime key performance indicators characterising their economic and environmental performance. Additionally, taxation schemes of varying extent are considered, and a sensitivity analysis is carried out on the most uncertain input parameters, namely, fuel prices and capital cost. This study results demonstrate that the hybrid plant using ammonia exhibits the lowest environmental footprint associated with 66% carbon emission reduction, whilst increasing the lifetime cost by 40%. Taxation schemes close to 340 EUR per CO2 tonne are required to render it economically viable whilst meeting the IMO targets for 2050 on CO2 emissions reduction. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the economic parameters is highly sensitive to fuel price and the capital expenditure. Â© 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This paper examines the management of ship power systems equipped by energy storage systems. Energy storage in the on-board power system can increase the efficiency of prime movers in order to reduce fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. In this paper, a management strategy for the on-board electrical network is proposed. The strategy optimally balances the charge/discharge of the storage device, the power of the generation system, the loads' demand of hotels, auxiliaries, and electrical machineries used for propulsion and maneuvering purposes. The optimal approach aims at minimizing the fuel consumption, while technical constraints of the on-board system are considered in terms of both generation system and energy storage system. A case study of a real off-shore supply vessel is proposed. The results of the numerical application are discussed showing the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Â© 2019 IEEE.

TI  - Storing Carbon for Geologically Long Timescales to Engineer Climate
JO  - NANA
PY  - 2014
VL  - 38
IS  - NA
AB  - To re-establish global climate balance, it is necessary to remove large amounts of fossil carbon emitted by humans, which is currently located in the atmosphere and the upper ocean. Although great attention is given to technologies of capture, the ability to store immense tonnages of carbon stock for geologically long time periods, isolated from atmosphere and ocean interaction, is equally important. In this chapter, the multiple storage locations for carbon stocking on and below land, also within and below the ocean, are evaluated. The evaluation shows that carbon dioxide reduction (CDR) is useful for mitigation, but cannot balance the rate of new emissions from fossil fuel exploitation. Many CDR methods have large uncertainty in their quantity, life-cycle, global impact and engineered feasibility. Competition for biomass and land usage is inevitable. Pathways and reservoirs of carbon in the ocean are complex and interlocked. Engineered storage of carbon will also be expensive, resource intensive and cannot substitute for a greatly reduced usage of fossil carbon. Human industrial and economic activity must ``move beyond hydrocarbons{''} to be sustainable beyond 2050.

AB  - The paper discusses the possibility of applying the trigeneration energy concept (cogeneration + absorption cooling) on diesel-powered refrigerated ships, based on systematic analyses of variable energy loads during the estimated life of the ship on a predefined navigation route. From a methodological point of view, mathematical modeling of predictable energy interactions of a ship with a realistic environment yields corresponding models of simultaneously occurring energy loads (propulsion, electrical and thermal), as well as the preferred trigenerational thermal effect (cooling and heating). Special emphasis is placed on the assessment of the upcoming total heat loads (refrigeration and heating) in live cargo air conditioning systems (unfrozen fruits and vegetables) as in ship accommodations. The obtained results indicate beneficiary energy, economic and environmental effects of the application of diesel engine trigeneration systems on ships intended for cargo transport whose storage temperatures range from -25 to 15 degrees C. Further analysis of trigeneration system application to the passenger ship air conditioning system indicates even greater achievable savings.

AB  - In order to protect the marine environment, the fuel cell has become a good candidate for the main energy source of marine vehicles due to its remarkable performance of high efficiency, quietness, and cleanness. However, the fuel cell of the hybrid power system has a critical drawback of short lifetime. For this reason, the development of the energy management strategy considering power sources degradation becomes significant and urgent. In addition, the power system configuration has a strong link with the control strategy. In this vein, a sizing method of the hybrid energy storage system for a fuel cell hybrid excursion ferry is proposed to prolong the fuel cell lifetime. Based on the configuration of the power system, a real-time optimization control strategy considering efficiency and durability is developed. To verify the control strategy, the mathematical model of the hybrid power system is established. Compared with the wavelet-based control strategy and rule-based control strategy, the proposed strategy has better performance in terms of the fuel economy, the system durability as well as the dynamic property.

AB  - A number of Wave Energy Converters (WEC) have been proposed by many researchers, but most of them are not economically competitive as a contender in the energy market. This article intends to contribute to the development of very viable concept, which called as Overtopping Breakwater for Energy Conversion (OBREC) aims to fully utilize traditional breakwaters and capturing wave energy. The OBREC and its concept have been physically modeled and tested in Aalborg University since 2012 until 2014 and showed the promising results. In present work, the most-recent CFD of FLOW 3D technology is used to provide a more reliable approach in analyzing wave flow over the structure, in particular, OBREC device. Thus, the numerical simulations are carried out for validating overtopping discharge performance from the previous experimental and prediction methods. The result shows a good agreement with the experimental data. Hence, FLOW 3D is highly capable in handling coastal issues, especially for evaluating overtopping wave parameters. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB  - The ``Moving-ship{''} scheme technically offers the maximum dilution of injected liquid CO2. Captured and liquefied at the plant on land, CO2 is delivered by ship and injected into ocean depths of 1000 to 2500 in with a suspended and towed pipe by a slowly moving ship. For a realistic scale, the CO2 discharge rate is 100kg/sec, towing speed is 3m/sec, the width of the wake of the pipe is 2m; the initial dilution ratio becomes about 1/60,000 prior to full droplet dissolution at 1,000m. The 5-year R\&D program (Phase-2) includes the verification of the dilution scheme of the above-mentioned concept by the ocean experiment. At the same time, based on the actual biological survey in the same site, the assessment of environmental impact for the hypothetical full-scale implementation will be conducted; the lethal CO2 concentration limit value will be identified for the mid-depth plankton of the site by the method developed in the first phase (from 1997 to 2002) of the NEDO R\&D program, and will then used in the food-web based assessment model of the site. The opportunity of the ocean experiment is open to the international partners, and the verified dilution factor attainable by moving-ship concept coupled with the established assessment methodology will be submitted to the international forum in order to obtain the legal acceptance of this technology as a measure of CO2 emission reduction. The Phase 2 was started in April this year, however, the experimental plan of the CO2 injection into the ocean will be revised because the permission for the experiment in Norway was withdrawn by the ministry of the environment last August.

AB  - Commercial shipping cannot readily reduce its dependency on fossil fuels. Ships are large energy consumers and need to carry sufficient fuel for a voyage. The principle of green steaming, when ships travel at slower speeds to arrive just-in-Time, is discussed and a methodology developed to estimate the carbon savings resulting if the industry were to adopt this practice. The method is based on public automatic identification system (AIS) data generated by commercial vessels. A speed profile is estimated for each ship, and based on observed anchoring times, potential savings are computed by back propagating the distance a ship could travel at its slowest observed speed. The methodology is demonstrated for the Port of Gothenburg. There is a discussion of how the methodology can estimate carbon emissions avoided by the global shipping industry. Also considered are the actions needed, particularly regarding digital collaboration, to realize the benefits.

AB  - Torque-speed characteristics of an oscillating wave energy converter (WEC) is necessary to determine its optimal power point and to extract the corresponding design parameters for the generator and power converters used to generate power from the WEC. In this paper, analytical expressions for the mechanical torque on the WEC due to the oscillating surge of seawater are derived, and the dynamic model of the WEC is developed. A method for hardware emulation of the WEC is proposed by controlling the torque of an electric motor. The reference torque of the motor is derived by solving the mechanical dynamics of the WEC system in a real-time computing device considering a typical sea wave input. The emulated WEC dynamics is validated through variable loading on a generator coupled with the emulator. Experimental results support the existence of an optimal power point of the derived WEC model. Â© 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Networking and integrated transmission of large-scale wind power bases are the key technical links for large-scale wind power bases to connect to the power grid. If the DC pooling scheme is adopted, there will be no reactive power consumption in the wind farm, and the power flow will depend on the DC voltage distribution of the DC pooling network. There is an essential difference between the operation control strategy and the AC pooling, which will solve the reactive voltage stability of the wind farm, and reduce wind farm construction and operating costs, improving operational efficiency. DC aggregation network technology is not only a concern of DC technical workers, but also a problem that other large inland wind farms and offshore wind farms need to study. It can be seen that the research on the DC networking technology scheme of large-scale renewable energy power generation will have guiding significance for the development and utilization of renewable energy power generation in the power grid, promote the healthy development of renewable energy power generation and related industries, and be friendly to the construction of a strong smart grid, provides good technical support.

As a result, under irregular wave conditions it is found that the running and starting characteristics of the impulse type turbines could be superior to those of the Wells turbine. Moreover, as the current challenge on turbine technology, the authors explain a twin-impulse turbine topology for wave energy conversion. Copyright Â© 2012 Manabu Takao and Toshiaki Setoguchi.

TI  - A study on the carbon dioxide injection into coal seam aiming at enhancing coal bed methane (ECBM) recovery

PY  - 2020
VL  - 10

AB  - Coal seams, particularly deep unmineable coal reservoirs, are the most important geological desirable formations to store CO2 for mitigating the emissions of greenhouse gas. An advantage of this process is that a huge quantity of CO2 can be sequestrated and stored at relatively low pressure, which will reduce the amount of storage cost required for creating additional platform to store it. The study on CO2 storage in coal seam to enhance coal bed methane (ECBM) recovery has drawn a lot of attention for its worldwide suitability and acceptability and has been conducted since two decades in many coalmines. This article focuses on the coal seam properties related to CO2 adsorption/desorption, coal swelling/shrinkage, diffusion, porosity and permeability changes, thermodynamic/thermochemical process, flue gas injection, etc. Here, the performance analysis of both CO2 storage and ECBM recovery process in coal matrixes is investigated based on the numerical simulation. In this study, a one-dimensional mathematical model of defining mass balances is used to interpret the gas flow and the gas sorption and describe a geomechanical relationship for determining the porosity and the permeability alteration at the time of gas injection. Vital insights are inspected by considering the relevant gas flow dynamics during the displacement and the influences of coal swelling and shrinkage on the ECBM operation. In particular, pure CO2 causes more displacement that is more efficient in terms of total CH4 recovery, whereas the addition of N-2 to the mixture assists to make quicker way of the initial methane recovery. However, this study will support future research aspirants working on the same topic by providing a clear conception and limitation about this study.

JO  - Journal Of Cleaner Production
PY  - 2020

AB  - Emissions produced by fuel oil combustion in marine engines contribute to marine environment pollution and have a negative impact on both human health and the environment. This impact is more pronounced for ships which mostly operate near ports and inhabited areas, such as ro-ro passenger ships. The relevant legislation prescribes a reduction of carbon dioxide on account of its contribution to the problem of global warming. This paper deals with the assessment of the carbon footprint of the Croatian ro-ro passenger fleet in the Adriatic Sea and the corresponding measures to reduce it. This paper analyses a total of 27 ferry lines along the Croatian coast that produce around 29,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually. The analysis distinguishes two lines, Valbiska-Lopar and Vis-Split, with a significantly higher relative contribution to total emissions. The potential to introduce measures to reduce the carbon footprint on these lines is discussed. By implementing these measures, the carbon footprint of the Valbiska-Lopar line can be reduced by almost 40\%, while that of the Vis-Split line can be lowered by around 27\%. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

JO  - Physiological And Biochemical Zoology

VL  - 85
IS  - 5
AB  - Oceanic CO2 has increased from 280 to 380 Î¼atm since preindustrial times and is expected to reach 1,900 Î¼atm by 2300. In addition, regional upwelling zones exhibit levels up to 2,300 matm, making exploration at future global projected CO2 levels ecologically relevant today. Recent work has demonstrated that CO2 exposure as low as 1,000 Î¼atm induces acidosis in toadfish (Opansus beta), leading to metabolic compensation by retention of blood in an effort to defend pH. Since increaseHCO-3 serosal HCO-3 translates to increased HCO-3 secretion rates in isolated intestinal tissue, we predicted that blood elevation of and Pco2uring exposure to 1,900 Î¼atm CO2 HCO-3 would increase in vivo base secretion rates. Rectal fluid and CaCO3 excretions were collected from toadfish exposed to 380 (control) and 1,900 Î¼atm CO2 for 72 h. Fluids were analyzed for pH, osmolality, ionic composition, and total CO2. Precipitated CaCO3 was analyzed for titratable alkalinity, Mg2+, and Ca2+ content. Fish exposed to 1,900 Î¼atm CO2 exhibited higher rectal base excretion rates, higher rectal fluid HCO-3 (mmol L-1), and lower fluid Cl- (mmol L-1) than controls, suggesting increased intestinal anion exchange as a result of the compensated respiratory acidosis. This study verifies that imminent projected CO2 levels expected by the year 2300 lead to greater HCO-3 intestinal loss, a process that acts against compensation for a CO2- induced acidosis.

AB  - The Marine Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) is recognized as an effective tool to measure the level of carbon emissions from ships at home and abroad. It will play an important role in the assessment of carbon emissions from the shipping industry, especially under the current and future development goal of carbon neutrality. Various green technologies to reduce the carbon emissions of ships have been demonstrated and applied. Hybrid power system is one of them. Compared with traditional direct propulsion, it can significantly reduce the energy consumption and carbon emissions of ships in inland waters such as the Yangtze River. Based on the characteristics of the hybrid power system, this paper firstly analyzes the power types of the hybrid power system during ship navigation. Then, according to the principle and elements of EEDI calculation method, it puts forward the key problems that should be solved in ship EEDI calculation of hybrid power system. Then, according to different hybrid operation modes, it also puts forward the calculation method of EEDI of each power mode and the calculation method of acquired EEDI of hybrid ship. Finally, the calculation and analysis of a 7500DWT hybrid bulk carrier show that the EEDI calculation method for hybrid ships proposed in this paper is scientific and reasonable.

AB  - High voltage shore connection of large passenger vessels is an important way to improve energy efficiency and reduce local and global emissions, as well as noise. However, it is shown that the vessels' steel hulls will act as sacrificial anodes for the grounding systems in the ports, hence accelerated corrosion of the hulls may occur. The required protective earth (PE) conductor between the hull and the grounding system on shore could also introduce touch voltages above 30 V in case of a fault, posing a safety hazard. Based on field measurements and analyses, a grounding strategy with galvanic separation in the low resistance PE conductor is recommended. It is further advised to use active and passive cathodic protection, and to reduce the set point of the impressed current cathodic protection (ICCP) system to approximately 100 mV versus zinc. These measures will reduce the corrosion rate of the vessels' hulls during power delivery from shore, while avoiding transferred touch voltages. Â© 2018 IEEE.

AB  - On 13 April 2018, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) published an initial strategy on reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships. The ambitious vision of this strategy is to reduce the total annual GHG emissions from international shipping by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008. One of the solutions to achieve this vision is to operate vessels on alternative marine fuels that generate less or no GHG emissions, like liquefied natural gas (LNG), hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, ethanol, biofuel, synthetic fuel, electricity (produced by battery), and so on. The challenge is that each alternative fuel has its own characteristic on various aspects. For instance, some alternative fuels may generate no GHG emission but can have higher risk than conventional marine fuel. Other alternative fuels may generate no GHG emission with relatively low risk, but the capital and/or operational expenditure can be significantly higher than other fuels. The main objective of this paper is to explore the properties of selected alternative marine fuels and to emphasize the necessity of integrated evaluation of them. It is concluded that the alternative marine fuels need to be comprehensively evaluated with respect to environmental impact, risk to human, and business value. Â© 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Liquid CO2 dissolution observed at CO2 sequestration in the ocean, CO2 mitigation strategy, is accompanied by CO2 clathrate-hydrate film, which has a large effect on the estimation of the strategy. Therefore, the mechanism of CO2 dissolution with hydrate film is a point of special interest. From this viewpoint, the present paper presents a new technique to measuring the thickness of the hydrate film formed at the interface between liquid CO2 and water. The technique is based on the dissolution model of liquid CO2 with hydrate film whose unique thickness is maintained by the dissolution at the water side and formation at the liquid CO2 side in the process of CO2 dissolution, if the hydrate is not formed at the liquid CO2 side, only the dissolution occurs and its characteristics is applied to the measurement of the thickness of hydrate film. Using a high pressure experiment apparatus, a water droplet was injected into the liquid CO2 to attach the hydrate film, The water droplet has an effect to stop the hydrate formation. After 2.1 s, the hydrate film disappeared at the contact point. The hydrate thickness was estimated to be about 0.43 mu m using these data. it was confirmed that the experimental results also have supported the dissolution model.

AB  - Heatwaves under global warming have negative impacts on ecosystem primary producers. This warming effect may be synergized or antagonized by local environments such as light and nutrient availability. However, little is known about the interactive effects of warming, irradiance, and nutrients on physiology of marine macroalgae, which are dominant in coastal ecosystems. The present study examined the combined effects of warming (23 and 26 degrees C), irradiance (30 and 150 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1)), and nutrients (enriched and non-enriched) on specific growth rate (SGR) and biochemical compositions of the canopy-forming marine macroalga Sargassum fusiforme. The negative effect of warming on SGR and ratio of chlorophyll (Chl) c to Chl a was antagonized by decreased irradiance. Moreover, the negative effect of temperature elevation on carbon content was antagonized by nutrient enrichment. These results suggest that the effect of warming on the growth and carbon accumulation of this species can be mitigated by decreased irradiance and nutrient enrichment.

AB  - With an increasing emphasis on emission restrictions and environmental impact of carbon-based energies, transportation industries are rapidly focusing on research, development, and implementation of zero-emission fuels and technologies. In the United States, the maritime industry provides key transportation services for people and goods. Immediate and future legislation at the state and federal levels are beginning to push passenger vessel operators to seek more carbon-neutral propulsion methods and begin the necessary transition towards a zero-emission future. Small high-speed, zero-emission vessel concepts are being introduced in the United States, most notably the SWITCH project of San Francisco. The SWITCH project aims to put the first hydrogen fuel cell e-ferry into service in 2021. To date, the zero-emission fast ferry efforts have focused on smaller passenger vessels. This paper examines the potential design elements and operating conditions required for a large (450 passengers) high-speed vessel to meet zero-emission standards. Key ferry metrics of speed and passenger capacity are studied with this concept hull to compare a zero-emission propulsion system against a more traditional carbon-based system. To account for major project decision factors, the economics/cost and regulatory restrictions of a hydrogen fuel cell system are considered for a high-speed passenger vessel of this scope. A sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the technological and performance gains necessary for fuel cell power to match the current capabilities of carbon-based powers. Future development of zero-emission technologies is discussed to evaluate the continually improving opportunities for such a large high-speed vessel.

AB  - According to the International Maritime Organization (IMO)â€™s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) strategy whose aim is to reduce the shipping industryâ€™s total carbon emissions by 50% by the year 2050, it is desirable to increase ships energy efficiency to reduce GHG emissions and fuel costs. To do so, a short-term measure is to develop innovative engine control strategies in waves that will reduce shipâ€™s GHG emissions. In this study, a mathematical model is developed to assess two engine control strategies: the standard constant rotational speed mode and an innovative constant fuel rack approach. The coupled model is made of a mean value engine, propeller curves and a ship behavior simulator. Emphasis is placed on the presentation of the engine model and references are given for further details on the ship simulator. After verifying the coupling between the engine model and the ship simulator, the fuel consumption is compared, for the two strategies, at the same average speed and for three head regular waves. This paper presents the basics of a further long time research project and shows that coupling ship simulators with engine simulators leads to promising simulation tools for a shipâ€™s GHG emissions reduction. Results from a first application case show that the constant fuel rack approach reduces fuel consumption (up to 1.6%). Â© IMechE 2022.

VL  - 11

AB  - The recent IPCC reports state that continued anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are changing the climate, threatening ``severe, pervasive and irreversible{''} impacts. Slow progress in emissions reduction to mitigate climate change is resulting in increased attention to what is called geoengineering, climate engineering, or climate intervention - deliberate interventions to counter climate change that seek to either modify the Earth's radiation budget or remove greenhouse gases such as CO2 from the atmosphere. When focused on CO2, the latter of these categories is called carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Future emission scenarios that stay well below 2 degrees C, and all emission scenarios that do not exceed 1.5 degrees C warming by the year 2100, require some form of CDR. At present, there is little consensus on the climate impacts and atmospheric CO2 reduction efficacy of the different types of proposed CDR. To address this need, the Carbon Dioxide Removal Model Intercomparison Project (or CDRMIP) was initiated. This project brings together models of the Earth system in a common framework to explore the potential, impacts, and challenges of CDR. Here, we describe the first set of CDRMIP experiments, which are formally part of the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). These experiments are designed to address questions concerning CDR-induced climate ``reversibility{'' the response of the Earth system to direct atmospheric CO2 removal (direct air capture and storage), and the CDR potential and impacts of afforestation and reforestation, as well as ocean alkalinization.

AB  - Establishing an energy monitoring and management methodology is a quintessential milestone for informed energy savings decision making as well as for effectively reducing the cost and the environmental impact of shipping operations. In this study, a novel systematic methodology is proposed for the energy management of the ship propulsion engine, which is the largest ship energy producer. The methodology employs a combination of tools including statistical analysis, compressor modelling to predict the engine airflow and energy and exergy analyses, whereas its output includes the engine operating profile, the most frequently occurring propeller curves and the engine most frequent operating points, the key performance indicators for quantitatively assessing the recorded parameters quality as well as the energy/exergy flows and the engine components exergy destruction. The methodology is implemented for three case studies for a very large crude carrier, a container ship and a bulk carrier, for which recorded data were available by using different monitoring techniques from either noon reports or automatic data acquisition systems. The derived results provide the engine operating profile demonstrating that the investigated vessels were operating in slow steaming conditions with a lower engine efficiency associated with a greater exhaust gas wasted energy. The measured data analysis demonstrates the better quality of the data recorded by automated monitoring systems and pinpoint maintenance issues of the engine components. Lastly, the exergy analysis results demonstrate that the exhaust gas and jacket cooling water provide the greater exergy flows rendering them attractive for energy saving initiatives, whereas the engine block, compressor and turbine are the engine components with the greater exergy destruction, thus requiring closer monitoring for timely identifying mitigating measures.

JO  - Wind Energy Science
PY  - 2022
VL  - 7
IS  - 5
AB  - Due to the increasing share of wind energy in the power system, minute-scale wind power forecasts have gained importance. Remote-sensing-based approaches have proven to be a promising alternative to statistical methods and thus need to be further developed towards an operational use, aiming to increase their forecast availability and skill. Therefore, the contribution of this paper is to extend lidar-based forecasts to a methodology for observer-based probabilistic power forecasts of individual wind turbines and aggregated wind farm power. To do so, lidar-based forecasts are combined with supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)-based forecasts that advect wind vectors derived from wind turbine operational data. After a calibration, forecasts of individual turbines are aggregated to a probabilistic power forecast of turbine subsets by means of a copula approach. We found that combining the lidar- and SCADA-based forecasts significantly improved both forecast skill and forecast availability of a 5 min ahead probabilistic power forecast at an offshore wind farm. Calibration further increased the forecast skill. Calibrated observer-based forecasts outperformed the benchmark persistence for unstable atmospheric conditions. The aggregation of probabilistic forecasts of turbine subsets revealed the potential of the copula approach. We discuss the skill, robustness and dependency on atmospheric conditions of the individual forecasts, the value of the observer-based forecast, its calibration and aggregation, and more generally the value of minute-scale power forecasts of offshore wind. In conclusion, combining different data sources to an observer-based forecast is beneficial in all regarded cases. For an operational use one should distinguish between and adapt to atmospheric stability.

TI  - A Energy-Savings Evaluation Method to Justify Automatic Power Factor Compensators on Marine Vessels
JO  - NANA
PY  - 2012
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Many induction motors are installed in ship electric power systems, where a poor power factor is often overlooked. Power factor compensation that is usually achieved by adding capacitive load to offset the inductive load present in the system can have many benefits. As a ship power system, fuel oil costs and air pollution emissions for power generation remain low. This paper aims to establish a set of energy-savings evaluation model for benefit-cost analysis for automatic power factor compensators (APFCs) applied in marine vessels. The active power, reactive power, power factor, and diesel electric engine's oil consumption for a practical commercial vessel power system during different operating conditions were measured and analyzed. Base on the actual measurements, an APFC for marine use is designed and the possible benefits after installing the APFC are quantified to justify the investment by using two standard cost-benefit analysis methods. Sensitivity analysis is also performed to reduce effects of input parameters on the analysis results and determine the critical parameters. Analysis results can assist shipbuilding corporations and ship owners in managing energy efficiency of similar systems and building business cases for determining return on investment (ROI).

An additional litter decomposition experiment was conducted in all plots by adding litter bags containing 10 g of dried D. spicata shoot litter. Seedling growth was measured yearly. One and four years after the start of the experiment, soil samples were collected to determine physical and chemical soil conditions, potential nitrification and denitrification activities and abundances of genes that are related to microbial processes in the nitrogen cycle. Results Growth of R. mangle seedlings was stimulated in the presence of R. mangle litter, while decomposition rates of D. spicata litter were lower in plots with R. mangle litter and seedlings. The presence of R. mangle litter and/or seedlings had no significant effect on potential nitrification and denitrification activities and on the abundances of genes. Conclusions The colonization of R. mangle into D. spicata-dominated salt marshes will affect the carbon cycle, but not necessarily the nitrogen cycle, which is likely due to the pre-existing nitrogen-limited conditions in the salt marsh.

AB  - The strict emission standards for port approach and coastal navigation, and the fuel-saving requirements, in the marine sector, are pushing the manufactures to consider more advanced and alternative propulsion systems. In this context, this study deals with the design and management of an innovative hybrid thermal-electric propulsion system. The evaluations are referred to the case study of a leisure boat, which is used for passenger transportation in tourist areas. Experimental tests are carried out on single components, with a particular focus on re-calibration of the thermal engine, for its homologation and optimal use in the proposed hybrid architecture. The identification of proper management strategies is performed on the basis of a boat simulation model, which is set up starting from experimental data and characteristics of components. In this regard, an optimization procedure, based on the use of genetic algorithms, is performed in order to set the parameters of onboard energy management strategies and pursue the double objective of extending battery pack cycling life and reducing exhaust emissions. The obtained simulation results highlight the benefits of the proposed architecture showing sensible improvements in comparison with a traditional ICE based configuration. The methodology proposed in this paper enables reliable evaluations and preliminary optimization of energy management strategies, with a drastic reduction in experimentation time and general costs.

PY  - 2017
VL  - 22
IS  - 3
AB  - To reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships as required by international environmental regulations, we propose herein an energy-saving method for ships sailing on wavy seas. The effect of applying this method is investigated by a numerical study of a bulk carrier self-propelled in regular head and following waves. The method requires that the ship be equipped with a controllable-pitch propeller (CPP) and an electric propulsion motor, which are controlled in an optimal manner to anticipate impending waves, thereby minimizing energy consumption. Optimal control is implemented using a nonlinear model predictive control method that uses information within a receding horizon to calculate the adjustments, which in turn control actuators that vary the propeller-pitch angle and the drive frequency of the motor. To implement this real-time application, we use a fast algorithm for solving the model predictive control problem. As a result, for a wave steepness of 0.01 and a unity ratio of wavelength to ship length, the energy required to propel a bulk carrier without optimal control is reduced by about 10% with the optimal-control system proposed herein.

AB  - In recent years, the integration of wind power generation facilities, and especially offshore wind power generation facilities, into power grids has increased rapidly. Therefore, the grid codes concerning wind power integration have become a major factor in ensuring power system reliability. This work compares grid codes about wind power integration around the world. The grid codes of Denmark, Ireland, the U.K., Germany, Spain, China, the U.S., Canada, and other countries are considered. The most important of these grid codes concern reactive power, frequency regulation, fault ride through, and power quality. Several grid codes also address communication, ramp rate, and offshore wind power plants. This work provides information on the future of grid code requirements for offshore wind power integration, which helps the system operators ensure the safe operation of a power system with a high penetration of wind power generation.

AB  - In recent years the acknowledgement of the relations between the emissions of exhaust gas, in particular CO2, and their effects on climate and environment has grown to a wide level. Many countries and international organizations have begun to work to mitigate the problem and drive the society towards more sustainable sources of energy. Shipping is no exception and in 2018 the IMO-International Maritime Organization set the ambitious goal of reducing the CO2 emissions of the shipping industries of at least 50% within 2050, compared to the levels of 2008. This has introduced the need to research and develop new, sustainable energy sources and power systems for ships. The REShiP projects is aimed to identify a type of ship which would be suitable for an early adoption of a carbon free or carbon neutral fuel and a matching power generation system, tailored on specific routes. A small ferry powered by a hybrid combination of liquid hydrogen-fuelled fuel cells and Lithium-ion batteries has thus been identified. A mathematical model was developed to optimize the usage of fuel cell and batteries based on the ship operative profile. A multi objective optimization was implemented to minimize system performance degradation. To support the mathematical model a 7 kW PEMFC power generating unit was assembled and relevant data have been analysed. Following a regulatory framework research and in lack of comprehensive prescriptive rules, the design of the ferry and the prototype was done in accordance with the alternative design approach based on the risk assessment methodology, reaching a level of confidence appropriate to award an approval in principle.

AB  - After a brief overview of the actual state of wind energy and planned offshore projects in Germany, state of the art wind power generators are described. It is explained, that a favourite generator system for such offshore applications is the Doubly-Fed Induction Machine (DFIM), due to its advantages in weight and operation. Furthermore, a State-Space-Equation-Model of the DFIM in field oriented coordinates is derived and discussed. This coordinate system offers the possibility of decoupled control of active and reactive power. The structures of the control loops are presented. To enable an effective simulation of large wind farms, two reduction steps can be performed: 1) The differential equation of the rotor is reduced by compensating the transient rotor time constant with the rotor current control. 2) Furthermore, the differential equation of the stator is reduced by means of the Singular Perturbation Method. The derived first order model can appropriately describe the dynamics of controlled DFIM in multi machine installations.

AB  - Over last two decades, solar and wind energies have become an alternative to traditional energy sources. These alternative energy sources are non-polluting, free in their availability and are renewable. Another alternative is tidal energy, which is related to falling and rising ocean water levels. Tidal behavior can be predicted easily and this means that if it is enabling to harness tidal energy, it can be produced power for specific periods of time. In this paper, a new hybrid combination of renewable energy sources is considered. The combination of wind, photovoltaic and tidal is taken into account as a primary and battery as an auxiliary source. The aim of design is to minimize the annualized cost of the generation system over its 20 years of operation. Determining the capacity of hybrid wind, photovoltaic, tidal and battery is formulated as an optimization problem. The objective function is the minimization of the cost with the constrain having specific reliability index. To evaluate the system reliability level, the Equivalent Loss Factor (ELF) has been used as an index. Comparison between hybrid wind, solar and battery and new combination of renewable energy is done and it is shown that the combination of wind, solar, tidal and battery is more economical. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used for optimal sizing the system. Simulation results are carried out by MATLAB software. It is shown that hybrid system is the best configuration that has minimum cost and can satisfy all constrains. Â© 2012 IEEE.

AB  - Container shipping is the largest producer of emissions within the maritime shipping industry. Hence, measures have been designed and implemented to reduce ship emission levels. IMOâ€™s MARPOL Annex VI, with its future plan of applying Tier III requirements, the Energy Efficiency Design Index for new ships, and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan for all ships. To assist policy formulation and follow-up, this study applies an energy consumption approach to estimate container ship emissions. The volumes of sulphur oxide (SOx), nitrous oxide (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from container ships are estimated using 2018 datasets on container shipping and average vessel speed records generated via AIS. Furthermore, the estimated reductions in SOx, NOx, PM, and CO2 are mapped for 2020. The empirical analysis demonstrates that the energy consumption approach is a valuable method to estimate ongoing emission reductions on a continuous basis and to fill data gaps where needed, as the latest worldwide container shipping emissions records date back to 2015. The presented analysis supports early-stage detection of environmental impacts in container shipping and helps to determine in which areas the greatest potential for emission reductions can be found.

AB  - Mangrove environments are important for maintaining biodiversity and carbon cycling. However, these systems are being degraded at alarming rates around the world, particularly in rapidly developing regions. Here, we examine a sediment profile from a mangrove forest near a large port complex at Suape, northeast Brazil, in order to assess the impact of rapid urbanization and industrialization. We find that total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) accumulation rates have increased in the estuary since the 1980?s, directly related to rapid urban development. The TN and heavy 615N values in the sediment column suggest increasing anthropogenic influences. In contrast, heavy metal fluxes did not increase during these transitions. The increase in TOC and TN accumulation rates during the past four decades highlight the significant role mangrove areas play as sinks for anthropogenically enhanced nutrients in poorly-understood tropical areas.

AB  - Fixed type pendulum wave energy converter is a kind of movable body type wave energy converter and it was invented by Kondo and Watabe with Muroran Institute of Technology in Japan. Some researches on this device were carried out experimentally and theoretically, and its high energy conversion efficiency was shown. However, the coast which can be constructed the devise is limitted and the cost to construct the caisson occupies about 70% of all cost on this device. And also, it is difficult to keep it safety in storm condition like a typhoon. In order to solve these problems, Watabe proposed the floating type pendulum wave energy converter (FPWEC) which is moored to the seabed with some lines and carried out some research on FPWEC, however it is not enough to say that the design method for this device was established. In this paper, a FPWEC model which consists buoyancy block, pendulum and generator was made. Some tests were conducted in a two dimensional wave tank and power outputs and motions of the floating body in regular waves were measured.

AB  - The selection of the suitable propulsion system for LNG carrier highly affects the ship capital and life cycle costs. The current paper compares between the available propulsion systems for LNG carriers from environmental and economic points of view operated with heavy fuel oil (HFO) and marine gas oil (MGO). In addition, the cost-effectiveness for emission reduction due to using dual fuel propulsion options using natural gas fuel (NG) is calculated. As a case study, large conventional LNG carrier class has been investigated. The results show that steam turbine (ST), Ultra-ST, dual fuel diesel engine (DFDE), and combined gas and steam (COGAS) propulsion options can comply with NOx and SOx emissions regulations set by IMO using dual fuel mode with NG percentages of 87.5\%, 82\%, 98.5\% and 94\%, respectively. DFDE operated with pilot HFO and NG is the most economic propulsion option. It reduces the dual fuel costs by 1.37 MUS\$/trip compared with HFO cost. The annual cost-effectiveness for the most economic and emission compliance propulsion option is 6.07 \$/kg, 6.39 \$/kg, and 0.55 \$/kg for reducing NOx, SOx, and CO2 emissions, respectively.

AB  - Among the renewable sources, the energy stored in waves is more concentrated than others such wind or solar energy sources. The wave energy sectors are at the cutting edge of engineering design and several technologies sound technical solutions, with positive steps towards commercial viability, however, the cost of energy projection is still too high to allow direct access to mass electricity market in the short term. Meanwhile, the extension of O&G Companies presence in offshore and deep water frontier regions has been one of the main causes of the increasing interest in ocean wave energy in upstream operations. Consideration is directed to the increasing offshore power demand which triggers a challenge of maintain environmentally responsible operations while maximizing returns on O&G production investment. Accelerated development of ocean energy technologies by O&G offshore experience and investments could offer a wide range of long-term benefits, such as new routes to decarbonisation, creation of a new generation portfolio and potential economic opportunities for the development of wave farms and multi-megawatt projects. This paper aims at giving an overview of the first worldwide open water demonstration project of a wave energy converter connected to a refitted gas platform off the coast of Ravenna in Adriatic Sea, an open-sea facility to support research, technical testing and commercial demonstration of prototypes and offshore stand-alone renewable multi-source grid. It will address the deployment, the sea prototype testing and offshore power export of ISWEC, a Wave Energy Converter able to transform the wave-induced motion of a vessel into electrical power, by gyroscopic effects produced from a spinning flywheel carried inside it.

TI  - Reducing the Dimensions of the Ship's Main Switchboard-A Contribution to Energy Efficiency
JO  - Energies
PY  - 2021
VL  - 14
IS  - 22
AB  - Energy efficiency generally implies the efficient use of energy in all sectors of final consumption-industry, services, agriculture, households and transport. Shipping accounts for nearly 3\% of global greenhouse gas emissions, making it the sixth largest CO2 producer in the world. This is a result of inefficient ship design, lack of planning and optimal use of resources. As the transport sector expands, so does the pressure for a greener and cleaner maritime industry. Reducing fuel consumption is a major driver of the need for energy efficiency on ships. In this paper, due to the importance of maritime transport, we observed the impact of reducing the dimensions of the main switchboard as a contribution to energy efficiency. This contribution is not of great importance as is the case with the optimization of the navigation route, etc., but it certainly affects the weight and, thus, the fuel consumption, which contributes to energy efficiency in the designed system. The aim of this paper is to optimize the design of the main switchboard by using 2D simulations of possible bus topologies, in order to develop six different busbar models and find one that best meets the requirements. The simulation results indicate the optimal location and dimensions of the busbars in the main switchboard in accordance with the switchgear parameters. Apart from the change in layout and dimensions of the busbars, the replacement of conventional instrument transformers with new current/voltage sensors contributes to a significant reduction in the weight and size of the switchboard, which ultimately benefits energy efficiency.

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - The eventual evasion of injected CO2 to the atmosphere is one consideration when assessing deep sea disposal Of CO2 as a potential response option to climate change concerns. Evasion estimated using an ocean carbon cycle model is compared to long-term trajectories for future CO2 emissions, including illustrative cases leading to stabilization of CO2 concentration at various levels. Modeled residence time for CO2 injected into the deep ocean exceeds the 100-year time scale usually considered in scenarios for future emissions, and the potential impacts of climate change. Illustrative cases leading monotonically to constant CO2 concentration have been highlighted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to give guidance on possible timing of emission reductions that may be required to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations at various levels. For stabilization cases considered, significant modeled evasion does not occur until long after CO2 emissions have reached a maximum and begun to decline. Illustrative cases can also lead to a maximum in CO2 concentration followed by a decline to slowly decreasing concentrations. In such cases, future injection of emissions into the deep ocean leads to lower maximum CO2 concentration, with less effect on concentration later on in time.

AB  - The concept of hybrid cars, where a combination of prime mover and energy storage allows a more efficient use of fuel shows considerable promise. Our work considers the same concept for ship propulsion using a storage medium in order to reduce the transient loads of the main engine (e.g. operation in rough sea, manoeuvre or speed variations) and applying a load levelling technique. Emissions that are produced in transient cases are higher and the developed reduction techniques deal mainly with the optimum operational point. This work, using real operational data of Post Panamax vessels, correlates daily sea state and engine loading to propose and size alternative hybrid propulsion system to reduce emissions and fuel consumption. The latter are calculated using the "as measured" fuel consumption; the bunker characteristics and widely adopted empirical formulae. Finally, the design issues of how hybrid technology would potentially affect modern ship design are examined along with the economic feasibility of the proposed scenarios. Â© 2010 COPPE/UFRJ.

JO  - Proceedings Of The Annual Offshore Technology Conference
PY  - 2011
VL  - 1
IS  - NA
AB  - Antiscaling agents are widely used to prevent scale formation in the oil and gas industry because scale's presence can lead to unscheduled shutdown and deferred oil production. The main problems result from the formation of scale on equipment. It has been shown that the mechanism of scale formation differed according to the scale nucleation that occurred in the bulk solution or on a surface. The scope of this paper is to show, from experimental data, the effects of three different antiscalants on the growth rate of CaCO 3 formation on a metal surface. The choice of which inhibitors to study was based on a survey of the environmental regulations that can be encountered in different parts of the world. A conventional phosphorous inhibitor was used as a reference (polyphosphinocarboxylic acid, PPCA) and contrasted to the performance of two environmentally friendly inhibitors (polymaleic acid, PMA, and carboxymefhyl inulin, CMI). The use of an in situ flow cell coupled with a video assembly and a microscope permits the real-time visualization of crystal morphology. Studies included looking at the surface coverage of the calcareous deposit and the number of crystals of CaCO 3 formed. The effects of the scale inhibitors on the growth of calcium carbonate were studied after nucleation had occurred, in order to determine the effects of the inhibitors on calcium carbonate crystals already formed. A previous study was focused on the assessment of the inhibitors on the nucleation and growth steps. This paper is focused on the effects of the scale inhibitors on growing crystals which have been formed on a surface under uninhibited conditions. The morphology of the crystals was found to be modified by the three inhibitors studied but to different extents. The addition of 4 ppm of PPCA and PMA significantly decreased the growth rate of the calcium carbonate crystals but the CMI did not modify it at the concentration range tested. This technique demonstrates that the efficiencies of scale inhibitors can vary according to the step in which the antiscalants were added (nucleation/growth).

AB  - This paper presents a methodology to perform small-signal analysis of an offshore ac network, which is formed by interconnecting several offshore wind power plants. The off-shore ac network is connected with different onshore ac grids using point-to-point voltage-source-converter high-voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) transmission links. In such a network, each offshore VSC-HVDC converter operates in grid-forming mode. In this paper, the offshore VSC grid-forming control is enhanced by using a frequency and voltage droop scheme in order to establish a coordinated grid control among the offshore converters. A small signal model of the offshore ac network is developed that includes the high-voltage alternating current cables' model, the converters' current, and voltage-control model, the frequency droop scheme, and the voltage droop scheme. Based on this model, an eigenvalue analysis is performed in order to study the influence of the frequency and voltage droop gains on overall offshore ac network stability. Finally, theoretical analysis is validated by performing nonlinear dynamic simulation.

JO  - Environment Development And Sustainability
PY  - 2022

AB  - The environmental consequences of ship-based greenhouse emissions have been increasingly significant as a result of the rise in the share of maritime transportation in international trade. Transnational organizations such as the European Union and the International Maritime Organization monitor these emissions and have come to limit some gas emissions such as SOx, NOx, PM, and CO2. These limiting measures are all needed and welcome. However, we need more accurate data to inform and implement even more concrete policies. This study contributes to such efforts by providing calculations of the emissions of NOx, NMVOC, PM, SOx, CO, and CO2 from an oceangoing container ship during its 37-day voyage in 2019. The use of a real case scenario differentiates this study from others. We employed two conventionally used methods to make the estimations. One is the fuel-based approach (top-down) and the other is the activity-based approach (bottom-up). While there is some discrepancy of results produced by the two methods, there is also consistency in terms of percentages regarding which gas is emitted most and when. The results indicate that by taking appropriate measures such as reducing fuel consumption, and using low-sulfur fuel, as well as optimizing port traffic, the environmental damage of maritime transportation could be reduced.

TI  - Adaptive Droop Control Strategy Participating in Power Grid Frequency Regulation for VSC-MTDC Transmission System

IS  - 13
AB  - In view of the voltage source converter based multi-terminal direct current (VSC-MTDC) transmission system connected with large-scale offshore wind farms, the power distribution mechanism of the conventional DC voltage droop control is derived, and the impacts of the control strategy on the frequency of receiving grid are analyzed. The DC capacitor of the VSC-MTDC system is used for energy storage, and the frequency of receiving grid is coupled with the DC voltage of VSC-MTDC system. Then an adaptive droop control strategy participating in the primary frequency regulation is proposed. The strategy can adjust the DC voltage droop coefficient in real time according to the AC system frequency deviation, which makes each converter station rapidly adjust its own power output without communication. Thus the AC system frequency can be stabilized in a reasonable range. Finally, a five-terminal VSC-MTDC system is formed in the DigSILENT/PowerFactory simulation software, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by results of three simulation examples.

AB  - Sequestering waste CO2 in the deep ocean as a gas, liquid, or hydrate has been variously proposed (1-3). We describe experiments producing CO2 hydrate that may eventually assist in developing methodology for large-scale creation of this ice-like substance. We produced a simple and inexpensive system for conducting high-pressure experimentation. We established the minimum ratio of CO2 to water (both deionized water and seawater) needed to produce stable traces of hydrate. We suggested an explanation for the differences observed in forming hydrate from the two media. We demonstrated that hydrate decomposed when exposed to an intermittent flow of water. We proposed a model of pathways involved in forming CO2 hydrate. Previous reports on hydrate formation have emphasized pressure-temperature relationships and effects thereon. Our experimentation focused on the amount of CO2 in all phases inside the pressure chamber (designated as Y-CO2). The minimum Y-CO2 needed for producing hydrate varied with pressure. Hydrate became unstable and decomposed in intermittently flowing water. Our approach has yielded new information regarding requirements for hydrate formation and the potential for dissolution in the deep ocean.

AB  - A novel ship propulsion concept employs natural gas to reduce ship emissions and improve overall ship propulsion efficiency. This concept proposes a serial integration of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and a natural gas engine, while anode-off gas (gas at the fuel cell exhaust) is used in the natural gas engine. This study focusses on SOFC-gas engine integration by experimentally analyzing the effects of adding hydrogen, which is the main combustible component of the fuel cell anode-off gas, in marine natural gas engines. The overall challenge is to employ the anode-off gas to improve the performance of marine natural gas engines. To study the effects of anode-off gas combustion in natural gas engines, experiments with hydrogen addition in a marine natural gas engine of 500 kW rated power were performed. Natural gas was replaced with 10 % and 20 % of hydrogen, by volume, without any penalties in terms of output power. We found that the high combustion rate of hydrogen improved combustion stability, which allowed for better air-excess ratio control. Thus allowing leaning to higher air-excess ratios and extending the, otherwise, limited operating window. Hydrogen addition also improved brake thermal efficiency by 1.2 %, while keeping NOx emissions below the maritime emission regulations. The improvement in engine efficiency with a larger operating window may help improve the load-taking capabilities of marine natural gas engines. Copyright Â© 2018 ASME.

IS  - NA
AB  - Seawater desalination has two major negative environmental impacts: brine production/discharge and a large carbon footprint arising from energy consumption. Sequential CO2 mineralization is a promising technology to address both issues. This paper reports the effects of key reaction parameters in this process, namely additional agitation of the reactant phases, presence of electrolytes, and CO2 microbubble injection rate. It was found that enhanced mass transport of reactants under agitation and an appropriate CO2 microbubble injection rate are necessary for effective CO2 mineralization by precipitating carbonate minerals. Compared to deionized water, various electrolytes in the brine reduced the amount of CO2 required to achieve the same Mg conversion ratio. However, deionized water led to a much higher purity (98\%) of the precipitated hydromagnesite, a valuable product of sequential CO2 mineralization. This report provides useful guidelines for the design of systems for sequential CO2 mineralization with seawater desalination brine.

AB  - Bucket foundation, as an emerging type of supporting structure for offshore wind turbines, has attracted much attention in the field of offshore wind power in China owing to its superior bearing capacity and efficient construction method. Thin-walled bucket foundations have been successfully installed in Jiangsu maritime space and achieved good economic benefits. In this study, considering the upsizing of wind turbines and the far-reaching of wind fields, a thick-walled bucket foundation is proposed. Using a concrete skirt instead of a steel skirt, the thick-walled bucket foundation can effectively reduce the cost and prevent the buckling problem of the steel skirt during construction, transportation, and installation. However, the increase in the skirt's thickness leads to greater sinking resistance. An accurate calculation of the penetration resistance is the key to the successful installation of the thick-walled bucket foundation. Therefore, static pressure tests of thin- and thick-walled models were conducted to measure the subsidence resistance and soil pressure at the sidewalls and ends. By comparing the similarities and differences of the sinking resistance of the two models, the coefficients of the thin-walled sinking resistance calculation formula were optimized, and the calculation method of the thick-walled sinking resistance was proposed. The arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method was verified and used to simulate the dynamic continuous sinking process of the thick-walled test. Results show that the growth of the skirt's thickness compacts the end soil and causes the end soil pressure to increase while the side soil is disturbed. Thus, the lateral soil pressure decreases. The cone penetration test(CPT)is recommended to calculate the sinking resistance of the thick-walled bucket foundation when the end resistance coefficient is 0.7, and the skin friction coefficient is 0.03. For the thin-walled bucket foundation, the end resistance and skin friction coefficients are 0.5 and 0.04, respectively.

AB  - The reduction of the environmental impact imposed by Kyoto Protocol and the growth of competitiveness imposed by the shipping market have urged shipping companies to pay increasing attention to ship energy efficiency improvement and CO2 emission reduction. According to the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) recommended by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the main scope of this article is in fact to overcome the deterministic limits of the monitoring systems installed in modern ships and support technical management in decision making based on large navigation databases. The proposed statistical approach is founded on a multiple linear regression and allows for both pointwise and interval predictions of the fuel consumption. At the end of each voyage, the model can be used to alert management for a possible change in ship performance in all those situations where the actual fuel consumption lies outside the prediction interval. Moreover, the model can also be utilized to quantify the contribution to the fuel consumption due to the hull and propeller fouling, which is particularly profitable for shipping companies and operators to claim for carbon credits after a specific improvement operation.

TI  - Parametric investigation and optimal selection of the hybrid turbocharger system for a large marine four-stroke dual-fuel engine
JO  - Applied Thermal Engineering
PY  - 2022
VL  - 208
IS  - NA
AB  - Hybrid turbochargers can become an attractive solution for new built and retrofitted ship power plants, as their use can result in increasing the plant efficiency and reducing emissions. This study aims at computationally investigating the hybrid turbocharger effects on a large marine dual-fuel four-stroke engine performance and emissions characteristics as well as determining its electrical generator optimal size for the case of a ship power plant considering an actual operating profile. An existing model of a large marine four-stroke dual-fuel engine of the zero/one-dimensional type, which was developed in the commercial software GT-Power, is extended to include the hybrid turbocharger sub-model. This model is subsequently employed to carry out a parametric investigation considering a wide range for the hybrid turbocharger electric motor power. The derived results are analysed to identify the variations of the investigated dual fuel engine performance and emissions parameters in the whole engine operating envelope at both the diesel and gas modes, whilst taking into account the engine and its components operational limits. For the considered annual load profile, the results demonstrate that the optimal nominal size of the hybrid turbocharger electric motor power is 300 kW and leads to an annual energy surplus between 2% and 3% of the annually delivered engine mechanical energy. This study benefits the quantification of the hybrid turbocharger impact on large marine dual fuel four-stroke engines as well as the ship energy efficiency, thus providing useful decision support to facilitate the shipboard implementation of this technology.

JO  - Marine And Petroleum Geology
PY  - 2022
VL  - 146
IS  - NA
AB  - Geological Carbon Sequestration (GCS) needs to increase in scale by a hundred to thousand-fold to achieve the climate targets set out by the 2015 Paris Agreement. As such, assessment of storage potential and containment risk is required across many types of subsurface opportunities (including depleted fields and saline aquifers). In particular, the assessment of containment risk can be a daunting task, as it requires rock property calibration of heterogeneous intervals that are usually poorly sampled. The sequence-stratigraphic method is applied here using two case studies to illustrate how it can be utilized to articulate containment potential and risk for storage of immiscible supercritical Carbon dioxide at basin-to-prospect scales. In the onshore case studies presented here, facies dominated by (detrital) clay-mineral aggregates provide the most consistent excellent seals capable of retaining in excess of 200 m Carbon dioxide plume heights. Perhaps contrary to held paradigms, more distal basinal facies tend to be more inconsistent seals, due to a dominance of biogenic depositional components and complex diagenetic alterations. In the case studies, thick successions of argillaceous mudstones are typically associated with transgressive to early-highstand retreating to aggrading muddy clinoform deposits. These clinoform deposits can be shore (delta) attached or represent more distal offshore contourite mudbelts. In addition to the broad sequence-stratigraphic setting of appropriate lithofacies, the combination of basin type and sediment delivery will govern the geometry and lateral extend of favourable top seal deposits. Continental-crust foreland basins may develop favourable accumulations across thousands of square kilometres, whereas failed basins tend to exhibit much narrower facies belts. Finally, while perhaps logistically challenged, continental slope to basin-floor post-rift sediments of passive margins connected to large river input systems provide broad and thick favourable mud facies belts over distributive reservoir deposits.

AB  - To ensure the compliant of the CO2 regulation, the IMO set standards for the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) for ships that also led to a higher propelling costs and additional abatement investments for ship owners making energy efficiency and fuel-saving a high priority in shipping operations. This study focuses on the financial analysis of investment on waste heat recovery that has its origin in the heavy industry especially in power plants, steel mills and other high-energy fabrics. As with other industries, the waste heat recovery systems (WHRS) can also be used to reduce emissions and fuel consumption of ship engines but is still relatively new in the maritime industry and until now, the economic assessment of the installations are still not adequately covered in the scientific literature. The evaluation of the investment of the WHRS installations on ships carried out in this work used the traditional capital budgeting analysis followed by the real-option approach that includes a fuzzy model. The results were validated using data from a ferry plying between Tallinn and Helsinki. The capital budgeting analysis reveals that the investment in maritime WHR technology is economically favorable only under certain frame conditions. On the other hand, the real-option analysis shows a practical and pragmatic assessment of the WHRS investment even when implemented under high uncertainty and volatility condition in material resource markets.

IS  - 2
AB  - Electrochemical CO2 capture technologies are gaining attention due to their flexibility, their ability to address decentralized emissions (e.g., ocean and atmosphere) and their fit in an electrified industry. In the present work, recent progress made in electrochemical CO2 capture is reviewed. The majority of these methods rely on the concept of ``pH-swing{''} and the effect it has on the CO2 hydration/dehydration equilibrium. Through a pH-swing, CO2 can be captured and recovered by shifting the pH of a working fluid between acidic and basic pH. Such swing can be applied electrochemically through electrolysis, bipolar membrane electrodialysis, reversible redox reactions and capacitive deionization. In this review, we summarize main parameters governing these electrochemical pH-swing processes and put the concept in the framework of available worldwide capture technologies. We analyse the energy efficiency and consumption of such systems, and provide recommendations for further improvements. Although electrochemical CO2 capture technologies are rather costly compared to the amine based capture, they can be particularly interesting if more affordable renewable electricity and materials (e.g., electrode and membranes) become widely available. Furthermore, electrochemical methods have the ability to (directly) convert the captured CO2 to value added chemicals and fuels, and hence prepare for a fully electrified circular carbon economy.

VL  - 188
IS  - NA
AB  - The Energy Efficiency Operation Index (EEOI), one of schemes as a monitoring performance indicator related to SEEMP which is the mandatory regulation for ships in operation, intending to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in maritime transportation. It is closely related to vessel speed and the waterway environment, among other factors. Finding the optimal main engine speed is a basic way to improve energy efficiency and reduce the EEOI. Ships in ice areas are also affected by the impact of ice loads during navigation. It is critical to consider uncertainties when reducing the EEOI of ships in ice areas to achieve energy savings and reduce emissions. In this study, the data mining of ice loads was realized through wavelet decomposition, which proved that it is reasonable to take ice loads into account as random uncertainty random variables. This research introduces uncertainty analysis and optimization theory when considering ice loads and other important stochastic factors. The main engine speed of ships in ice areas was then taken as the design variable. By solving the minimum EEOI optimization model, a robust and reliable speed optimal result was obtained, and the effectiveness and advancement of this method was verified using a comparative example.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 330
IS  - NA
AB  - This paper presents, for the first time, a comprehensive comparative analysis of the potential of using biochars from three distinctly different UK-sourced biomass feedstocks, produced via three different thermal processing techniques, to adsorb methylene blue dye. Biochars were made from rapeseed, whitewood, and seaweed (Laminaria Digitata), produced via hydrothermal conversion, pyrolysis, and torrefaction. Adsorption kinetic models were developed for each biochar at different temperatures, pH and initial dye concentrations. Relatively high levels of methylene blue adsorption capacity were achieved by seaweed-based biochars (similar to 150 mg/g), with reasonable levels for rapeseed-based biochars (similar to 60 mg/g), whilst adsorption levels were found to be relatively low for whitewood-based biochars (< 30 mg/g). A Pseudo-second-order kinetic model provided the best fit with experimental results. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm showed a better fit for seaweed biochars, while the Freundlich adsorption isotherm was a better fit for the rapeseed-based biochars. The Langmuir adsorption isotherms showed relatively high maximum adsorption capacity (Qo) for seaweed-based biochars; similar to 175 mg/g for seaweed-Torrefaction and similar to 117 mg/g for seaweed-Pyrolysis. Negative Gibbs free energy (delta G degrees) values were observed for the seaweed-Torrefaction < seaweed-Pyrolysis < 0, which indicates that the methylene blue removal could be a thermodynamically favourable process due to the spontaneous nature of the adsorption. Our investigation has shown that the removal of methylene blue from wastewater could be a potential application for seaweed-based biochars as part of a holistic whole life cycle valorisation pathway. However, it is not suitable for all types of biomasses which emphasises the need for tailoring unique valorisation pathways for different types of biomasses.

The emission reductions can be attributed to the related technological advancement, including particularly the improvements in navigational performance and berthing in port, which can achieve better efficiencies and lower fluctuations in sailing speeds. The scenario modeling approach is first established based on the foreseeable development of energy policies and usage as well as ship operations. Subsequently, assessment is performed in five major ports worldwide, namely Shanghai, Singapore, Long Beach, Hamburg, Tokyo from Year 2020 to 2050. The results are compared to the corresponding projections with manned shipping to determine the probabilistic emission abatements with the gradual adoption of autonomous ships into the fleet. Overall, the results provide a better understanding of the future environmental benefits with autonomous shipping to the policymakers, shipowners, and shipping industry. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Sediment and terrestrial organic carbon budgets for the offshore Ayeyarwady Delta, Myanmar: Establishing a baseline for future change
JO  - Marine Geology
PY  - 2022
VL  - 447
IS  - NA
AB  - Large river deltas serve as globally important archives of terrestrial and shallow marine biogeochemical signatures and because of rapid sedimentation have the potential to impact global biogeochemical cycling. The Ayeyarwady Delta in Myanmar ranks as the world's third largest river delta in terms of sediment supply; however, modern increases in regional anthropogenic impacts risk severe alteration to sediment and TerrOC loads within this major system. By investigating modern sediment and terrestrial organic carbon (TerrOC) accumulation within the offshore Ayeyarwady Delta this study estimates baseline sediment and TerrOC budgets for this understudied mega-delta. Using 210Pb geochronology of 27 sediment cores collected from the continental shelf, we estimate that 405 (+52/-47) Mt of sediment, or ~70-80% of fluvial sediment discharged from the Ayeyarwady and Thanlwin rivers (the main inputs to the delta), accumulates there annually. Sediment not retained on the shelf is likely partitioned between the Ayeyarwady floodplain, shoreline accretion, and minor deep-sea export. Estimates of TerrOC (based on Î´13C mixing models) were coupled with modern sediment accumulation rates to determine an annual burial of 1.93 (+1.09/-0.15) Mt C on the shelf, with TerrOC burial fluxes being highest in the foreset beds of the subaqueous delta, coincident with the area of highest sediment accumulation rate. Based on estimates of the Ayeyarwady and Thanlwin rivers' TerrOC delivery, an apparent ~100% of TerrOC input is preserved on the continental shelf. However, an across shelf trend of increasing TerrOC degradation with distance offshore is also observed, indicating that while the shelf has high apparent TerrOC sequestration, carbon remineralization is also occurring prior to deposition within the subaqueous delta. Based on these conflicting outcomes, we suggest that input of TerrOC from additional sources other than the Ayeyarwady and Thanlwin rivers roughly balance the observed carbon remineralization. Main additional sources of TerrOC include the Sittang and several smaller rivers, and the Ayeyarwady delta plain below the river gauging station. As anthropogenic development within the Ayeyarwady and Thanlwin watersheds continues to increase, these sediment and TerrOC budgets provide a baseline from which future changes within the offshore Ayeyarwady Delta can be monitored.

PY  - 2014
VL  - 99
IS  - NA
AB  - We examined the long-term effect of naturally acidified water on a Cymodocea nodosa meadow growing at a shallow volcanic CO2 vent in Vulcano Island (Italy). Seagrass and adjacent unvegetated habitats growing at a low pH station (pH = 7.65 Â± 0.02) were compared with corresponding habitats at a control station (pH = 8.01 Â± 0.01). Density and biomass showed a clear decreasing trend at the low pH station and the below- to above-ground biomass ratio was more than 10 times lower compared to the control. C content and Î´13C of leaves and epiphytes were significantly lower at the low pH station. Photosynthetic activity of C. nodosa was stimulated by low pH as seen by the significant increase in Chla content of leaves, maximum electron transport rate and compensation irradiance. Seagrass community metabolism was intense at the low pH station, with significantly higher net community production, respiration and gross primary production than the control community, whereas metabolism of the unvegetated community did not differ between stations. Productivity was promoted by the low pH, but this was not translated into biomass, probably due to nutrient limitation, grazing or poor environmental conditions. The results indicate that seagrass response in naturally acidified conditions is dependable upon species and geochemical characteristics of the site and highlight the need for a better understanding of complex interactions in these environments.

Our approach is related to assessing risks that are assumed to be fundamentally related to the estimation of wind speed exceedance probabilities at selected hub heights of wind turbines in the farm and of associated wind turbine loads. As part of this preliminary framework for risk assessment, synthetic storm tracks are first simulated over the ocean using available historical tropical storm data; then, a hurricane intensity evolution model based on thermodynamic and atmospheric environmental variables is developed for each of the tracks as they get to regions within the proximity of the chosen wind farm site. Based on this intensity model, a turbulent wind field can be simulated at locations of interest along the hurricane track. The simulated turbulent wind field may then be used to estimate wind speed exceedance probability distributions and, when combined with correlated waves, it can also be used in analysis of the response of individual turbines in a wind farm. The framework for the overall risk assessment is presented; the individual components that comprise such an assessment are described briefly in illustrative applications. Copyright Â© 2012 by ASME.

TI  - Modelling the effect of large arrays of tidal turbines with depth-averaged Actuator Disks
JO  - Ocean Engineering
PY  - 2016
VL  - 126
IS  - NA
AB  - The Actuator Disk concept is suitable to simulate the flow interactions between tidal turbines. As the computational expense of AD simulations is too large for applications at regional scale, the â€œbed frictionâ€ method is generally preferred. It consists in applying an enhanced drag over the tidal farm area. The main drawback is that the flow around each turbine is not resolved and that the flow interactions between the turbinesâ€™ wakes are neglected. The extent to which this simplification affects the accuracy of the large scale flow is not well understood. Here, we propose a methodology for representing large arrays of tidal turbines in Shallow Water Equations solvers. It consists in representing individual turbines as small areas where a sink momentum term is applied. The sink term is calculated from the vertical integration of the force exerted on an AD. After validating the model, we apply the methodology to simulate the effect of 45 turbines placed in the Alderney Race. The results are compared to the results obtained with the â€œbed frictionâ€ method. The two approaches give similar results because the hydrodynamics conditions of the Alderney Race favor the mixing of the wakes which prevents the flow interactions between the turbines.

AB  - Conforming to the factor characteristics of electricityâ€“water cogeneration power plants, an improved multieffect desalination (MED) and reverse osmosis (RO) are the most current techniques for seawater desalination. A principal change between these operations consists of their various energy requirements, thermal energy for MED and mechanical energy for RO plants. The main improvement ideas of RO and MED are the recovery of large quantities of heat produced during the production of sulfuric acid, which exhibits an exothermic reaction where a part of this heat will be used for the thermal power plant and subsequently reverse osmosis and another amount of heat recovery system will be used to desalinate seawater by the MED system. In this work, the sulfuric acid is used to recover heat energy; this energy is used in a hybrid system of ROâ€“MED in order to desalinate the seawater. A thermodynamic steady-state study of this system is investigated to select the optimum cogeneration system. These improvements could make the benefits of cogeneration to the energy consumption of an RO and MED which will be remarkably reduced. Â© 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - In the literature, different authors attribute between 15\% to 30\% of a wind farm's costs to logistics during the installation, e.g., for vessels or personnel. Currently, there exist only a few approaches for crew scheduling in the offshore area. However, current approaches only satisfy subsets of the offshore construction area's specific terms and conditions. This article first presents a literature review to identify different constraints imposed on crew scheduling for offshore installations. Afterward, it presents a new Mixed-Integer Linear Model that satisfies these crew scheduling constraints and couples it with a scheduling approach using a Model Predictive Control scheme to include weather dynamics. The evaluation of this model shows reliable scheduling of persons/teams given weather-dependent operations. Compared to a conventionally assumed full staffing of vessels and the port, the model decreases the required crews by approximately 50\%. Moreover, the proposed model shows good runtime behavior, obtaining optimal solutions for realistic scenarios in under an hour.

AB  - In order to improve energy efficiency for ships and to reduce their Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) was introduced. For every new ship the attained EEDI has to be calculated and not higher than the required EEDI, which is determined by the reference line value and the reduction factor defined in a set of time intervals. The aim of this paper is to analyze how the application of the required EEDI reduction factor will influence the general cargo ships GHG emission in future. These ships average lifetime is much higher compared to other ship types. Since the EEDI applies only to new ships it is interesting to analyze the effect of the EEDI implementation on their GHG emission in future and to compare it with the requirement of reaching mean global CO2 stabilization level in the atmosphere. The analysis showed that in order to reach the stabilization level a more stringent policy is required for general cargo ships which would encourage the implementation of innovative energy efficient technologies and result in lower GHG emission.

VL  - 5

AB  - Predators continue to be harvested unsustainably throughout most of the Earth's ecosystems. Recent research demonstrates that the functional loss of predators could have far-reaching consequences on carbon cycling and, by implication, our ability to ameliorate climate change impacts. Yet the influence of predators on carbon accumulation and preservation in vegetated coastal habitats (that is, salt marshes, seagrass meadows and mangroves) is poorly understood, despite these being some of the Earth's most vulnerable and carbon-rich ecosystems. Here we discuss potential pathways by which trophic downgrading affects carbon capture, accumulation and preservation in vegetated coastal habitats. We identify an urgent need for further research on the influence of predators on carbon cycling in vegetated coastal habitats, and ultimately the role that these systems play in climate change mitigation. There is, however, sufficient evidence to suggest that intact predator populations are critical to maintaining or growing reserves of `blue carbon' (carbon stored in coastal or marine ecosystems), and policy and management need to be improved to reflect these realities.

TI  - Optimal Slow Steaming Speed for Container Ships under the EU Emission Trading System
JO  - Energies
PY  - 2021
VL  - 14
IS  - 22
AB  - Slow steaming is an operational measure in ocean-going vessels sailing at slow speeds. It can help climate mitigation efforts by cutting down marine fuel consumption and consequently reducing CO2 and other Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG). Due to climate change both the European Union (EU) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) are analysing the inclusion of international shipping in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) in the near future or alternatively implementing a carbon tax. The paper proposes a methodology to decide the optimal speed of a vessel taking into account its characteristics and the factors that determine its economic results. The calculated cash flow can be used in valuation models. The methodology is applied for a case study for any container ship in a range from 2000 to 20,000 Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEU) on a leg of a round trip from Shanghai to Rotterdam. We calculate how speed reduction, CO2 emissions and ship owner's earnings per year may vary between a business-as-usual scenario and a scenario in which shipping is included in the ETS. The analysis reveals that the optimal speed varies with the size of the vessel and depends on several variables such as marine fuel prices, cargo freight rates and other voyage costs. Results show that the highest optimal speed is in the range of 5500-13,000 TEUs whether or not the ETS is applied. As the number of TEUs transported in a vessel increases emissions per TEU decrease. In an established freight rate market, the optimal speed fluctuates by 1.8 knots. Finally, the medium- and long-term expectations for slow steaming are analysed based on future market prices.

JO  - Wetlands
PY  - 2016
VL  - 36
IS  - 6
AB  - Tidal marsh creation helps remediate global warming because tidal wetlands are especially proficient at sequestering carbon (C) in soils. However, greenhouse gas (GHG) losses can offset the climatic benefits gained from C storage depending on how these tidal marshes are constructed and managed. This study attempts to determine the GHG emissions from a 4â€“6Â year old created brackish marsh, what environmental factors governed these emissions, and how the magnitude of the fluxes relates to other wetland ecosystems. The static flux chamber method was used to measure GHG fluxes across three distinct plant zones segregated by elevation. The major of soil GHG fluxes from the marsh were from CO2 (âˆ’48â€“192 mgÂ C m-2 h-1), although it was near the lower end of values reported from other wetland types having lower salinities, and would mostly be offset by photosynthetic uptake in this created brackish marsh. Methane flux was also low (âˆ’0.33â€“0.86 mgÂ C m-2 h-1), likely inhibited by the high soil SO4 2âˆ’ and soil redox potentials poised above âˆ’150Â mV in this in this created brackish marsh environment. Low N2O flux (âˆ’0.11â€“0.10 mgÂ N m-2 h-1) was due to low soil NO3 âˆ’ and soil redox conditions favoring complete denitrification. GHG fluxes from this created brackish marsh were generally lower than those recorded from natural marshes, suggesting that C sequestration may not be offset by the radiative forcing from soil GHG emissions if projects are designed properly.

This can be a very powerful method, as it can provide important insights into the irreversibilities of the system, as well as a methodology for identifying, and possibly minimizing, the main sources of loss. However, some of the simplifications used in recent studies raise more than a concern on the validity of the approach. This work proposes a method based on RANS equations to evaluate the en-tropy production in Wells turbines. An estimation of the second-law efficiency of different Wells turbine rotors is also presented, under conditions representative of the air flow inside an OWC device.

TI  - Nutrient Removal by Algae-Based Wastewater Treatment
JO  - Current Pollution Reports
PY  - 2022
VL  - 8
IS  - 4
AB  - Algae cultivation complements wastewater treatment (WWT) principles as the process uptakes nutrients while assimilates CO2 into biomass. Thus, the application of algae-based WWT is on the upward trajectory as more attention for recovery nutrients and CO2 capture while reducing its economic challenge in the circular economy concept. However, the complexity of wastewater and algal ecological characteristics induces techno-economic challenges for industry implementation. Algae-based WWT relies totally on the ability of algae to uptake and store nutrients in the biomass. Therefore, the removal efficiency is proportional to biomass productivity. This removal mechanism limits algae applications to low nutrient concentration wastewater. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) of algae-based WWT is significantly long (i.e. > 10 days), compared to a few hours in bacteria-based process. Phototrophic algae are the most used process in algae-based WWT studies as well as in pilot-scale trials. Application of phototrophic algae in wastewater faces challenges to supply CO2 and illumination. Collectively, significant landscape is required for illumination. Algae-based WWT has limited organic removals, which require pretreatment of wastewaters before flowing into the algal process. Algae-based WWT can be used in connection with the bacteria-based WWT to remove partial nutrients while capturing CO2. Future research should strive to achieve fast and high growth rate, strong environmental tolerance species, and simple downstream processing and high-value biomass. There is also a clear and urgent need for more systematic analysis of biomass for both carbon credit assessment and economic values to facilitate identification and prioritisation of barriers to lower the cost algae-based WWT.

AB  - Year 2010 is, in many ways, a year that will be better forgotten. It started in the depths of a global recession, and although there has been much cause for optimism, little of that has yet to reach the shipping and shipbuilding industries in tangible form. Year 2010 may also be remembered as the year in which ship efficiency and alternative fuels began to be taken seriously. The need for efficiency has to be met by more complex, cleaner, hull forms as well as more sophisticated machinery and systems. The year ended with DNV trumpeting its environmentally-friendly VLCC design concept, Traility. In 2010, The Motorship investigated the feasibility of holding a conference about gas fueled ships in 2010. At the time, and certainly in the view of experts just 12 mo back, the idea of large ocean-going merchant ships using LNG as fuel was seen as a pipe dream. Meanwhile, a consortium of British, American, and Greek interests agreed in November 20101 to investigate the practical maritime applications for small modular reactors, in particular for commercial tanker vessels. The Strategic Research Group at Lloyds Register Hyperion Power Generation, UK designer BMT Nigel Gee and Greek ship operator Enterprises Shipping and Trading are leading a research program into nuclear propulsion, which is technically feasible and has the potential to drastically reduce the CO2 emissions from commercial shipping. The project expects to result in a concept tanker-ship design in which special attention will be paid to analysis of lifecycle cost as well as hull-form designs and structural layout, including grounding and collision protection. In addition, its latest NYK Altair container ship recently made her maiden voyage, calling at Hamburg. The NYK Super Eco Ship 2030 concept claims to reduce CO2 emissions by up to 69% against current levels, using such measures as a lightweight hull with an air-lubrication system, while the extensive use of renewable energy sources and LNG-based fuel cells will further lower the carbon footprint.

VL  - 4
IS  - NA
AB  - Grouted Joints are typical means of connecting the supporting structure with the foundation piles of Offshore Wind Energy Converters (OWECs). The resulting gap of two steel pipes with different diameters is filled using a mineral-bound, high strength grout. Because of the special offshore conditions the grout material needs a high reliability and robustness against segregation for the pumping process. Up to now high performance concrete can be used with compressive strength exceeding 100 N/mm2. Because of the brittleness and risk of cracking in case of high performance grout material, discussions have come up in Germany whether to use steel fibres due to their crack-bridging effects. In this paper the opportunities and risks of steel fibres in Grouted Joints are described regarding to their effects on the fresh and hardenend concrete properties as well as the load-deformation behaviour of the construction. It is necessary to balance needs for the controllability of the filling process and the risk of cracking of hardened grout materials with and without fibre reinforcement. To determine the influence of steel fibres on the workability, slump flow tests with and without blocking effects were made. Currently, it is not recommended to use steel fibres for structural purposes. High doses of steel fibres, which produce an identifiable improvement of the load bearing behaviour result in critical problems for the filling process.

JO  - Ecological Engineering
PY  - 2016
VL  - 94
IS  - NA
AB  - Biochar (BC) application for improving soil quality and carbon sequestration has generated great interest for scientists and policy makers. BC can influence soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization through priming effects. Positive, negative or no priming effects on C mineralization has been observed following BC additions to soils. However, uncertainty still remains about the influence of biochar on SOC mineralization in the coastal wetland soils of the Yellow River Delta, China. Therefore, a five months of incubation experiment using the coastal wetland soil was conducted to investigate the effects of adding BC produced from peanut shell at 350 degrees C on SOC mineralization at the rates of 0\% (0\%BC), 0.1\% (0.1\%BC), 1\% (1\%BC) and 3\% (3\%BC) (w/w). BC addition increased the cumulative CO2 emissions, indicating that the cumulative SOC mineralization was enhanced in the coastal soil by BC application. However, the increased C mineralized only accounted for 1.71\%, 0.32\% and 0.17\% of the BC-C added in the 0.1\%BC, 1\%BC and 3\%BC treatments, respectively. Moreover, the experimental values of SOC mineralization was much lower than that of the theoretical values in both 1\%BC and 3\%BC treatments, indicating that a negative priming effect occurred. This may be explained by two reasons: (1) the conversion process of SOC to dissolved inorganic C (DIC) was accelerated by BC addition, which was confirmed by SEM image; (2) the amounts of available C substrate and microorganisms decreased via the sorption of labile organic C (LOC) and microorganisms onto BC. These results suggest that BC application will enhance soil C storage in the salinized wetland soils. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Proposed Inland Oil Tanker Design in Bangladesh Focusing CO2 Emission Reduction Based on Revised EEDI Parameters
JO  - Journal Of Marine Science And Engineering
PY  - 2020
VL  - 8
IS  - 9
AB  - Though inland ships account for a small portion of the total global CO(2)emissions from shipping, from the individual country's economic and environmental perspective, this is very important. To reduce CO2 emissions from sea-going ships by increasing energy efficiency, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted a generalized Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) in 2011. However, due to the variation in environmental, geographic and economic conditions, a generalized EEDI cannot be established in a similar fashion to that established by IMO. Shallow and restricted water effects, different fuel qualities (to reduce operational cost), increase in engine power requirements, reduction in carrying capacity, cargo availability, etc. make the EEDI by IMO inadequate for inland waterways. Therefore, an EEDI formulation based on revised parameters has been proposed for the inland ships in Bangladesh. This paper focuses on the possibility of CO2 emissions reduction from inland oil tankers in Bangladesh by implementing the revised EEDI formulation (henceforth denoted as EEDIINLAND). A sensitivity analysis was performed for the different ship design parameters of those oil tankers. Based on the analysis, suggestions were made on how to design inland oil tankers in Bangladesh using the revised EEDI formulation for reducing CO2 from the current level without any major cost involvement. Keeping the same speed and capacity, the vessels were redesigned based on those suggestions. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of those redesigned vessels using `Shipflow' showed a reduction in CO2 emissions through increasing EEDI(INLAND)by 7.54-13.65\%.

AB  - West Papua's Bintuni Bay is Indonesia's largest contiguous mangrove block, only second to the world's largest mangrove in the Sundarbans, Bangladesh. As almost 40\% of these mangroves are designated production forest, we assessed the effects of commercial logging on forest structure, biomass recovery, and soil carbon stocks and burial in five-year intervals, up to 25 years post-harvest. Through remote sensing and field surveys, we found that canopy structure and species diversity were gradually enhanced following biomass recovery. Carbon pools preserved in soil were supported by similar rates of carbon burial before and after logging. Our results show that mangrove forest management maintained between 70 and 75\% of the total ecosystem carbon stocks, and 15-20\% returned to the ecosystem after 15-25 years. This analysis suggests that mangroves managed through selective logging provide an opportunity for coastal nature-based climate solutions, while provisioning other ecosystem services, including wood and wood products.

Recommendation will be given on choice of coating systems, corrosion allowance, the necessity of pre-qualification, and the effects of durability of these. Also, the danger of microbiologically induced corrosion or the effects of high (tidal) currents will be presented. Guidance and justifications for the recommended approaches is given. We will present the possibilities and freedom of the designer finding site specific solutions while following these standards and recommendations to find the optimised site specific approach. Our standards and recommendations shall not be used as cookbooks, but engineering knowledge is needed applying the information contained. Merely following the text is not sufficient. We will provide guidance on the issue of optimizing the corrosion protection system in the area of conflict between OPEX and CAPEX. We will present the possibilities for the choice of corrosion protection strategies for installation phase with possible times without the final corrosion protection system (ICCP or GACP) being in place. We will provide emphasise the interaction of design and corrosion protection with special respect to the fatigue design, since the design of wind turbine structures fatigue driven in large areas. The audience will be able to learn about the latest standardisation processed within DNV GL for offshore wind with an emphasis on corrosion protection. They will learn about our experience gained with certifying offshore projects around the world. They will learn about the progress being made and the lessons learnt from the past for their own projects. Â© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim. All rights reserved.

TI  - The impact of remineralization depth on the air-sea carbon balance
JO  - Nature Geoscience
PY  - 2009
VL  - 2
IS  - 9
AB  - As particulate organic carbon rains down from the surface ocean it is respired back to carbon dioxide and released into the ocean's interior. The depth at which this sinking carbon is converted back to carbon dioxide-known as the remineralization depth-depends on the balance between particle sinking speeds and their rate of decay. A host of climate-sensitive factors can affect this balance, including temperature(1), oxygen concentration(2), stratification, community composition(3,4) and the mineral content of the sinking particles(5). Here we use a three-dimensional global ocean biogeochemistry model to show that a modest change in remineralization depth can have a substantial impact on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. For example, when the depth at which 63\% of sinking carbon is respired increases by 24 m globally, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations fall by 10-27 ppm. This reduction in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration results from the redistribution of remineralized carbon from intermediate waters to bottom waters. As a consequence of the reduced concentration of respired carbon in upper ocean waters, atmospheric carbon dioxide is preferentially stored in newly formed North Atlantic Deep Water. We suggest that atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are highly sensitive to the potential changes in remineralization depth that may be caused by climate change.

AB  - The challenges of climate change involve totally rethinking the world's energy system. In particular, CCS technologies are still presented as a solution to reach ambitious climate targets. However, avoiding the required Gt of CO2 emissions by investing in CCS technologies supposes the development of carbon storage capacities. This analysis, conducted with TIAM-FR and based on a wide review of geological storage potential and various data, aims to discuss the impact of this potential on the development of the CCS option. We also specify a scenario allowing the exclusion of onshore storage due to a hypothetic policy considering public resistance to onshore storage, and carbon transport costs variation effects. The implementation of CCS is less impacted by the level of carbon storage potential - except in the lowest case of availability - than by the type of sequestration site. However, the development of CCS is lower at the end of the period in the case of a decrease in carbon storage potential. Indeed, the question of type of storage site appears to have a greater impact, with an arbitrage between deep saline aquifers and depleted basins and enhanced recovery. Doubling the cost of carbon transport does not limit the penetration of carbon capture technologies, but it does impact the choice of site. Finally, a limitation of onshore storage could have a significant impact on the penetration of the CCS option. The explanation for this limited deployment of CCS is thus the higher cost of offshore storage more than the level of storage potential. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The global warming problem becomes serious in the world. The Japanese Government has formalized the acceptance of Kyoto Protocol on 4th of June, 2002. Under the Protocol, Japan has an obligation of greenhouse gas emissions reduction of 6% below 1990 levels for the first commitment period of 2008-2012. The Super Eco-Ship Project is conducted by the National Maritime Research Institute of Japan (NMRI) as a national project from April, 2001, controlled by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Super Eco-Ship would embody a technical breakthrough in meeting certain requirements of coastal shipping such as reducing the burden on the environment and the logistics costs and improving the living and working conditions on board. Super eco-ship has highly efficient electrical propulsion system featuring the podded propulsor with contra-rotating propeller (CRP). Advanced concept and systems are applied in the research and development of the Super Eco-Ship. Flexibility in the arrangement of main engine and in the hull form design is realized by the electric propulsion system. New design tools based advanced concept and methodology are applied. Hull form design method by means of CFD simulation and CAD are performed to design optimum hull form for electric propulsion system. The high propulsive efficiency due to the combination with the optimum hull design and podded propulsor enables the reduction of CO2 compared with the conventional ship. The podded propulsor with CRP enables drastically good maneuverability and flexible control system in ship operation as well as high propulsive efficiency. A captain or a pilot makes an easy operation during berthing by using the control device of the podded propulsor. Crew members are engaged in various works throughout all the onboard operational phases, i. e., loading/unloading, mooring, berthing, anchoring and navigation. In order to reduce work loads of crew members, labor-saving support systems are designed to help a basically single operator at each work position, such as a navigation bridge, a bow deck, a stern deck and a cargo deck, to execute each assigned mission. Onboard ship works are modeled throughout all the operational phases. A typical navigation scenario is selected that represents various works involved in the navigation. According to the scenario, time series of work contents and crew assignments in a conventional ship are drawn as a basic onboard work model. To minimize the crew members and their work loads, functions of the labor saving support system are decided. Navigation according to the typical scenario by the minimized crew members is simulated and compared with that of the conventional ship. Â© MODSIM 2009.All rights reserved.

JO  - Renewable \& Sustainable Energy Reviews
PY  - 2023
VL  - 171
IS  - NA
AB  - Carbon capture and storage for long-term sealing is one of the most promising approaches to mitigate global climate change. However, maximum capture amount and long-term safety of carbon dioxide storage in geological scenarios must be ensured. A case of a natural CO2 storage analog of the Huangqiao CO2-oil reservoir in the northern Jiangsu Basin, eastern China, is presented that can safely preserve carbon for millions of years, despite the mantle CO2-rich fluid having substantially altered the sandstone reservoirs. The calcite in the sandstone was significantly reduced by dissolution, thereby improving the CO2 storage capacity. Meanwhile, the mantle CO2-rich fluid advanced the precipitated calcite cement in the fractures of the mudstone caprock as it migrated upward, serving to self-seal the fractures and enhance the sealing capacity of CO2 storage. We numerically simulated artificial CO2 injection for 30 years in the depleted oil reservoir of Jurong near the Huangqiao CO2-oil reservoir; the maximum amount of CO2 injected into a single well can reach 5.43 x 106 t and increase the formation pressure by up to 95 bar. After injection, the saturation of gas-phase CO2 did not decrease remarkably over the following 300 years. No projected rapid CO2 leaked through fractures, owing to the selfsealing of fractures through calcite cement. This suggests that the depleted petroleum reservoir with an assemblage of sandstone reservoirs and overlying mudstone caprocks could be suitable for long-term and safe carbon capture and storage in geological formations.

TI  - Low carbon electricity systems for Great Britain in 2050: An energy-land-water perspective
JO  - Applied Energy
PY  - 2018
VL  - 228
IS  - NA
AB  - The decarbonisation of the power sector is key to achieving the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global mean surface temperature rise to well below 2 Â°C. This will require rapid, national level transitions to low carbon electricity generation, such as variable renewables (VRE), nuclear and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage, across the world. At the same time it is essential that future power systems are sustainable in the wider sense and thus respect social, environmental and technical limitations. Here we develop an energy-land-water nexus modelling framework and use it to perform a scenario analysis with the aim of understanding the planning and operational implications of these constraints on Great Britain's (GB) power system in 2050. We consider plausible scenarios for limits on installed nuclear capacity, siting restrictions that shape VRE deployment and water use for thermal power station cooling. We find that these factors combined can lead to up to a 25% increase in the system's levelised cost of electricity (LCOE). VRE siting restrictions can result in an up to 13% increase in system LCOE as the deployment of onshore wind is limited while nuclear capacity restrictions can drive an up to 17% greater LCOE. We also show that such real-world limitations can cause substantial changes in system design both in terms of the spatial pattern of where generators are located and the capacity mix of the system. Thus we demonstrate the large impact simultaneously considering a set of nexus factors can have on future GB power systems. Finally, given our plausible assumptions about key energy-land-water restrictions and emission limits effecting the GB power system in 2050, the cost optimal penetration of VREs is found to be at least 50%.

TI  - Biodiesel from microalgae: A critical evaluation from laboratory to large scale production
JO  - Applied Energy
PY  - 2013
VL  - 103
IS  - NA
AB  - The economically significant production of carbon-neutral biodiesel from microalgae has been hailed as the ultimate alternative to depleting resources of petro-diesel due to its high cellular concentration of lipids, resources and economic sustainability and overall potential advantages over other sources of biofuels. Pertinent questions however need to be answered on the commercial viability of large scale production of biodiesel from microalgae. Vital steps need to be critically analysed at each stage. Isolation of microalgae should be based on the question of whether marine or freshwater microalgae, cultures from collections or indigenous wild types are best suited for large scale production. Furthermore, the determination of initial sampling points play a pivotal role in the determination of strain selection as well as strain viability. The screening process should identify, purify and select lipid producing strains. Are natural strains or stressed strains higher in lipid productivity? The synergistic interactions that occur naturally between algae and other microorganisms cannot be ignored. A lot of literature is available on the downstream processing of microalgae but a few reports are available on the upstream processing of microalgae for biomass and lipid production for biodiesel production. We present in this review an empirical and critical analysis on the potential of translating research findings from laboratory scale trials to full scale application. The move from laboratory to large scale microalgal cultivation requires careful planning. It is imperative to do extensive pre-pilot demonstration trials and formulate a suitable trajectory for possible data extrapolation for large scale experimental designs. The pros and cons of the two widely used methods for growing microalgae by photobioreactors or open raceway ponds are discussed in detail. In addition, current methods for biomass harvesting and lipid extraction are critically evaluated. This would be novel approach to economical biodiesel production from microalgae in the near future. Globally, microalgae are largest biomass producers having higher neutral lipid content outcompeting terrestrial plants for biofuel production. However, the viscosities of microalgal oils are usually higher than that of petroleum diesel. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study focuses on estimating CO2 emissions and analysing energy efficiencies using the Energy Efficiency Operational Index (EEOI) for ferries sailing within an urban port of Taiwan and passenger-ships operating on island routes surrounding Taiwan. A comparative analysis of energy efficiency parameters showed that hybrid diesel-electric ferries had a 12% improved efficiency compared to the traditional full-diesel ferries, while high-speed passenger ships had up to 79% lower efficiency than medium-speed passenger ships. Some potential policies for reducing CO2 emissions from in-port ferries and island passenger-ships are presented based on these results. The estimated CO2 emissions from in-port ferries sailing within the urban port could be reduced by 10% when employing hybrid diesel-electric ferries instead of traditional full-diesel ferries. Emissions from island passenger-ships operating on island routes could be reduced by 11â€“26% through utilising small medium-speed passenger ships instead of small high-speed passenger ships and large passenger ships.

TI  - Technical Note: A mobile sea-going mesocosm system - new opportunities for ocean change research
JO  - Biogeosciences
PY  - 2013
VL  - 10
IS  - 3
AB  - One of the great challenges in ocean change research is to understand and forecast the effects of environmental changes on pelagic communities and the associated impacts on biogeochemical cycling. Mesocosms, experimental enclosures designed to approximate natural conditions, and in which environmental factors can be manipulated and closely monitored, provide a powerful tool to close the gap between small-scale laboratory experiments and observational and correlative approaches applied in field surveys. Existing pelagic mesocosm systems are stationary and/or restricted to well-protected waters. To allow mesocosm experimentation in a range of hydrographic conditions and in areas considered most sensitive to ocean change, we developed a mobile sea-going mesocosm facility, the Kiel Off-Shore Mesocosms for Future Ocean Simulations (KOSMOS). The KOSMOS platform, which can be transported and deployed by mid-sized research vessels, is designed for operation in moored and free-floating mode under low to moderate wave conditions (up to 2.5m wave heights). It encloses a water column 2m in diameter and 15 to 25m deep (similar to 50-75 m(3) in volume) without disrupting the vertical structure or disturbing the enclosed plankton community. Several new developments in mesocosm design and operation were implemented to (i) minimize differences in starting conditions between mesocosms, (ii) allow for extended experimental duration, (iii) precisely determine the mesocosm volume, (iv) determine air-sea gas exchange, and (v) perform mass balance calculations. After multiple test runs in the Baltic Sea, which resulted in continuous improvement of the design and handling, the KOSMOS platform successfully completed its first full-scale experiment in the high Arctic off Svalbard (78 degrees 56.2'N, 11 degrees 53.6'E) in June/July 2010. The study, which was conducted in the framework of the European Project on Ocean Acidification (EPOCA), focused on the effects of ocean acidification on a natural plankton community and its impacts on biogeochemical cycling and air-sea exchange of climate-relevant gases. This manuscript describes the mesocosm hardware, its deployment and handling, CO2 manipulation, sampling and cleaning, including some further modifications conducted based on the experiences gained during this study.

In this paper, plankton population dynamics are simulated in a single stratified water column to predict carbon dioxide sequestering due to surface iron fertilization in deep ocean. Using a predator-prey model and realistic parameter values, iron fertilization was found to only cause temporary blooms up to 5 months in duration, and relatively small increases in adsorption of atmospheric CO(2).

AB  - The German government aims to obtain at least 40 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. One of the central steps to reach this target is the construction of deep sea offshore wind farms. The paper presents a material intensity analysis of the offshore wind farms "Alpha Ventus" and "Bard Offshore I" under consideration of the grid connection. An additional onshore scenario is considered for comparison. The results show that offshore wind farms have higher resource consumption than onshore farms. In general, and in respect to the resource use of other energy systems, both can be tagged as resource efficient. Â© 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Mangroves provide important ecosystem services, including storing carbon belowground for millennia. Mangrove carbon storage relies in part on high primary productivity, but essential to the long-lived nature of this storage is the slow rate of microbial decomposition of peat. In this study, we (1) examined how carbon and nitrogen densities and microbial community composition vary with peat age and (2) describe the formation of peat deposits over time. At 4 mangrove sites near La Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico, we cored the sediments until rejection and obtained 5 cm samples at 20 cm intervals. In these samples, we measured organic carbon (Corg), total nitrogen, Î´13C, Î´15N, and radiocarbon (14C) age. We observed peat carbon densities of 3.4 Ã— 10-2 Â± 0.2 Ã— 10-2 g cm-3, Corg:N ratios of 42 Â± 3, and inter-site variation in Corg:N that reflects differing preservation conditions. Recalcitrant organic matter sources and anaerobic conditions leave a strong imprint on peat microbial communities. Microbial community composition and diversity were driven by depth and sediment characteristics, including Corg:N ratio and 14C age. Carbon dating allowed us to reconstruct the accumulation of organic matter over the last 5029 Â± 85 yr. Even over this long time scale, though microbes have evidently continuously cycled the peat nitrogen pool, peat carbon density remains effectively unchanged. Â© The authors 2022.

PY  - 2018
VL  - 43

AB  - In this study, carbon-free fuels -ammonia and hydrogen-are proposed to replace heavy fuel oils in the engines of maritime transportation vehicles. Also, it is proposed to use hydrogen and ammonia as dual fuels to quantify the reduction potential of greenhouse gas emissions. An environmental impact assessment of transoceanic tanker and transoceanic freight ship is implemented to explore the impacts of fuel substituting on the environment. In the life cycle analyses, the complete transport life cycle is taken into account from manufacture of transoceanic freight ship and tanker to production, transportation and utilization of hydrogen and ammonia in the maritime vehicles. Several hydrogen and ammonia production routes ranging from municipal waste to geothermal options are considered to comparatively evaluate environmentally benign methods. Besides global warming potential, environmental impact categories of marine sediment ecotoxicity and marine aquatic ecotoxicity are also selected in order to examine the diverse effects on marine environment. Being carbon-neutral fuels, ammonia and hydrogen, yield significantly minor global warming impacts during operation. The ecotoxicity impacts on maritime environment vary based on the production route of hydrogen and ammonia. The results imply that even hydrogen and ammonia are utilized as dual fuels in the engines, the global warming potential is quite lower in comparison with heavy fuel oil driven transoceanic tankers. Geothermal energy sourced hydrogen and ammonia fuelled transoceanic tankers release about 0.98 g and 1.65 g CO2 eq. per tonne-kilometer, respectively whereas current conventional heavy fuel oil tanker releases about 5.33 g/tonne-kilometer CO2 eq. greenhouse gas emissions.

JO  - Journal Of Environmental Management
PY  - 2017
VL  - 188
IS  - NA
AB  - Microbial communities play key roles in remediation and reclamation of contaminated environments via biogeochemical cycling of organic and inorganic components. Understanding the trends in in situ microbial community abundance, metabolism and carbon sources is therefore a crucial component of effective site management. The focus of this study was to use radiocarbon analysis to elucidate the carbon sources driving microbial metabolism within the first pilot Wetland reclamation project in the Alberta oil sands region where the observation of H2S had indicated the occurrence of microbial sulphate reduction. The reclamation project involved construction of a three compartment system consisting of a freshwater wetland on top of a sand cap overlying a composite tailings (CT) deposit. Radiocarbon analysis demonstrated that both dissolved and sediment associated organic carbon associated with the deepest compartments (the CF and sand cap) was primarily fossil (Delta C-14 = -769 to -955 parts per thousand) while organic carbon in the overlying peat was hundreds to thousands of years old (Delta C-14 = -250 to -350 parts per thousand). Radiocarbon contents of sediment associated microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) were consistent with the sediment bulk organic carbon pools (Peat: Delta C-14(PLFA) = 257 parts per thousand; Sand cap Delta C-14(PLFA) = -805 parts per thousand) indicating that these microbes were using sediment associated carbon. In contrast, microbial PLFA grown on biofilm units installed in wells within the deepest compartments contained much more modern carbon that the associated bulk carbon pools. This implied that the transfer of relatively more modern carbon was stimulating the microbial community at depth within the system. Correlation between cellular abundance estimates based on PLFA concentrations and the Delta C-14(PLFA) indicated that the utilization of this more modern carbon was stimulating the microbial community at depth. These results highlight the importance of understanding the occurrence and potential outcomes of the introduction of relatively bioavailable carbon to mine wastes in order to predict and manage the performance of reclamation strategies.

JO  - Energies
PY  - 2018
VL  - 11
IS  - 11
AB  - The Sea-wave Slot-cone Generator (SSG) wave-energy device is a type of electric energy converting structure that converts energy from sea waves, and which is designed and installed based on wave-overtopping in areas. Most of the previous studies have evaluated SSG systems based on hypothetical waves, considering the system geometry variations. However, it is important to consider the real wave conditions. This paper presents the results of a numerical study to investigate the performances of an SSG system in the context of the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea, where there is a strong need for renewable energies. The computational fluid dynamic (CFD) code Flow-3D was applied. First of all, available experimental data were applied to calibrate and evaluate the accuracy of the numerical model. Then, the real wave conditions on the coasts of the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea were imposed on the JONSWAP spectrum for the numerical modeling. Results of the study demonstrated that the hydraulic efficiency of the SSG system in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea was low for wave heights lower than 0.5 m. The nominal efficiency of the system was relatively more than 60% for wave heights higher than 1 m; thus, the performance of the SSG system was suitably evaluated. Finally, the numerical results demonstrated that the most optimal conditions, with a nominal efficiency of 97%, were obtained for incident waves that had a height of 2 m and a period of 5.6 s.

AB  - A shift towards more environmentally sustainable shipping is likely to open up for new technology in the maritime sector that is economically competitive to the current incumbent technology represented by diesel engines/generator sets. Marine fuel cell concepts are a promising new technology, which can offer several technical and operational advantages. This study assesses the competitiveness of marine fuel cell applications operated on Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) relative to diesel generator sets, with focus on economic and environmental performance. With regard to the latter, with a carbon containing fuel such as LNG, fuel cells reduce CO2 emissions by about 30% at maximum continuous rating and even more at partial load levels. NOx and SOx emissions are reduced up to 100%. As to the economics, the current higher investment costs of fuel cells are compensated by lower fuel costs (LNG). The modelled results show that with today's high fuel oil price (2008), an energy efficient technology such as fuel cells, will be economically competitive even with capital expenditures double that of the incumbent technology. CO2 taxation is expected to have less influence on the profitability.

VL  - 8
IS  - 6
AB  - The deposition and long-termburial of organic carbon in marine sediments has played a key role in controlling atmospheric O2 and CO2 concentrations over the past 500 million years1. Marine carbon burial represents the dominant natural mechanism of long-term organic carbon sequestration1,2. Fjords-deep, glacially carved estuaries at high latitudes-have been hypothesized to be hotspots of organic carbon burial, because they receive high rates of organic material fluxes from the watershed3. Here we compile organic carbon concentrations from 573 fjord surface sediment samples and 124 sediment cores from nearly all fjord systems globally. We use sediment organic carbon content and sediment delivery rates to calculate rates of organic carbon burial in fjord systems across the globe. We estimate that about 18 Mt of organic carbon are buried in fjord sediments each year, equivalent to 11% of annual marine carbon burial globally4. Per unit area, fjord organic carbon burial rates are one hundred times as large as the global ocean average, and fjord sediments contain twice as much organic carbon as biogenous sediments underlying the upwelling regions of the ocean1. We conclude that fjords may play an important role in climate regulation on glacial-interglacial timescales. Â© 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - The increase of ship's energy utilization efficiency and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions have been high lightened in recent years and have become an increasingly important subject for ship designers and owners. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is seeking measures to reduce the CO2 emissions from ships, and their proposed Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) aim at ensuring that future vessels will be more efficient. Waste heat recovery can be employed not only to improve energy utilization efficiency but also to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, a typical conceptual large container ship employing a low speed marine diesel engine as the main propulsion machinery is introduced and three possible types of Waste Heat Recovery Systems(WHRS) are designed. To calculate the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) of the given large container ship, two software packages are developed. Impact of performance of Waste Heat Recovery Systems(WHRS), as well as different ship design parameters, have been varied to see influence of these parameters on the EEDI. From the viewpoint of operation and maintenance, lowering the ship speed and improve container load rate can greatly reduce Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) and further reduce total fuel consumption. Although the large container ship itself can reach the International Maritime Organization requirements of EEDI at the first stage, i.e. with a reduction factor 10% under the reference line value, the proposed waste heat recovery systems can improve the ship EEDI reduction factor to 20% under the reference line value.

AB  - Harvesting the energy from ocean waves is one of the greatest attractions for energy engineers and scientists. Till date, plenty of methods have been adopted to harvest the energy from the ocean waves. However, due to technological and economical complexity, it is intricate to involve the majority of these energy harvesters in the real ocean environment. Effective utilization and sustainability of any wave energy harvester depend upon its adaptability in the irregular seasonal waves, situation capability in maximum energy extraction and finally fulfilling the economic barriers. In this paper, the front end energy conversions are reviewed in detail which is positioned in the first stage of the wave energy converter among other stages such as power take off (PTO) and electrical energy conversion. If the recent development of these front end energy conversion is well known then developing wave energy converter with economic and commercial viability is possible. The aim of this review is to provide information on front end energy conversion of a point absorber and emphasize the strategies and calamity to be considered in designing such kinds of devices to improve the energy harvesting competence. This will be useful to the engineers for speeding up the development of a matured point absorbing type wave energy converter.

AB  - This chapter provides an overview of the characteristics of main renewable sources for electrical power generation. First, three forms of renewable sources for electric power generation (wind, solar, and tidal) are reviewed to show their intermittent characteristics. Second, the challenge resulting from high penetration of variable renewable power generation is discussed. Flexibility in the power grid is thus required for balancing electricity supply and demand. Third, the integration of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with renewable power generation technologies is investigated to show how SOFCs could support the transition to a low-carbon power system. SOFCs have the potential to contribute to achieving a low-carbon power system. This contribution is mainly implemented via two ways: (1) to generate electricity using renewable gases such as hydrogen or biogas and (2) to provide flexibility to the power grid such as through ancillary services. This flexibility is able to facilitate the large-scale integration of renewable power generation technologies in power systems. SOFCs can also play a role as backup generation for local energy systems. Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Marine vessels (MVs), such as cruise ships, submarines, cargo ships, tugboats, and yachts, whether big or small, require powerful batteries to start their engines, to run electric lights, power inverters for kettles, microwaves, induction cookers, and nowadays even air-conditioning systems. Thus, energy-efficient batteries with long life spans have become an integral part of MVs. MVs have various power requirements depending on their size, number of crew members, and mode of operation. Traditionally, lead-acid batteries were used extensively for these purposes but have now been replaced with lithium-ion batteries. Compared with their predecessors, lithium-ion batteries are 60% lighter, nontoxic, have 10 times the cycle life due to a low discharge rate and fast charging, and deliver nearly their rated capacity even at the higher discharge current with no distilled water maintenance. Lithium battery technology based on the lithium-sulfur (Li-S) system has been in the development stage for commercialization because it possesses a higher specific energy density (500Whkgâˆ’1 or more), is cost-effective, and is more eco-friendly. However, a few issues, such as shuttle reactions and electrode stability, must be addressed to make the commercialization of Li-S battery technology possible. Many companies are now involved in designing and marketing Li-S batteries for automotive, aviation, and marine applications. This chapter is focused on the importance of batteries in marine applications. The energy requirements of different MVs, the types of batteries used and their energy density and capacity, and cost analysis for installation in MVs are summarized. The introduction of developed Li-S technology in electric or hybrid MVs, especially ferries and yachts, can reduce operational costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

While existing literature has investigated ship energy efficiency from different perspectives, a comprehensive review on measures, practices, policies, feasibility, and alternatives remains absent. This study presents a retrospective review of ship energy efficiency literature by utilizing a hybrid review method that combines bibliometric and content analysis approaches. For bibliometric analysis, the bibliometrix package in the R software was used in combination with the VOSviewer software. The outcomes of bibliometric analysis are the most ranked articles, journals, authors, and institutions related to ship energy efficiency research. The bibliographic coupling analysis identified five research clusters: (1) decarbonization and emission reduction measures, (2) speed management, (3) policy and regulations, (4) economic and organizational factors, and (5) alternative energy sources. Future research directions are proposed for each cluster. Â© 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - At the 62nd Meeting (2011) of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (henceforth MEPC), the IMO had adopted the proposed amendment adding to the MARPOL Annex Chapter â…¥ making it mandatory the EEDI (Energy Efficiency Design Index) for new ships as well as the SEEMP (Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan) for all ships. This was eventually for reducing GHG emissions from international shipping vessels, and has been effective since the 1st of January 2013 for ships weighing 400GT. Notably, at the 70th MEPC, the plan to develop a roadmap for the comprehensive IMO strategy on reducing GHGs from ships was approved, and as such, the plans including its short-term, mid-term and long-term measures have been arranged in order to adopt the pertinent strategy by 2023. Following the approved roadmap, at the 72nd MEPC (April, 2018), the first stage of reducing GHG emissions from ships was selected/passed as the Initial IMO strategy for the reduction of GHGs from ships (henceforth Initial IMO GHG Strategy), and at the 73rd MEPC (October, 2018), subsequent programs following the Initial IMO GHG Strategy were arranged. In this paper, the following issues will be introduced and discussed 1) the initial IMO strategy for the reduction of GHG from ships, 2) the contents of the 73Â ~Â 74 MEPC meeting regarding the follow-up actions related GHG reduction programs until 2023 to be executed (including specific matters concerning the execution of potential short-term, mid-term and long-term measures) 3) the GHG reduction strategies, GHG response policies of IMO member states and 4) finally, trends in technological developments for GHG reduction from ships.

AB  - Meeting future energy demands will require large-scale implementation of renewable energy projects. If one of these energy sources offshore wind becomes a common sight off coastlines, consideration of local public opinion and action will be critical. Previous research from the social sciences has lacked depth in examining the underlying factors that shape public opinion towards offshore wind development. The current research brings a new perspective to the literature by showing that how members of the public perceive support among others relates to their own opinions of offshore wind energy. We report results from two surveys. The first focused on opinion formation relating to offshore wind in general among New England residents, while the second focused on a specific offshore wind project in Rhode Island. We find evidence that both supporters and opponents of offshore wind underestimate levels of support among others, indicating a pluralistic ignorance effect and false consensus effect, respectively. We also find distinct patterns of perceived support among self-identified Republicans and Democrats. The findings hold important implications for policymakers and developers in understanding the nature of public support and opposition for offshore wind energy, particularly with respect to individuals' willingness to publicly engage with offshore wind projects.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 10
IS  - 5
AB  - One of the short-term operational measures for fuel savings and reducing CO2 emissions from ships at sea is sailing at reduced speed, i.e., slow steaming, while the gasification of the ship represents an important mid-term technical measure. In this study, the energetic and ecological benefits of slow steaming and gasification are studied for a container ship sailing between Shanghai and Hamburg. Resistance and propulsion characteristics in calm water are calculated using computational fluid dynamics based on the viscous flow theory for a full-scale ship, while the added resistance in waves is calculated by applying potential flow theory. The propeller operating point is determined for the design and slow steaming speeds at sea states with the highest probability of occurrence through the investigated sailing route. Thereafter, the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are calculated for a selected dual fuel engine in fuel oil- and gas-supplying modes complying with IMO Tier II and Tier III requirements. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for various slow steaming speeds compared to the design speed at different sea states, and for the gasification of a container ship. For realistic weather conditions through the investigated route, the potential reduction in CO2 emissions per year could be up to 11.66 kt/year for fuel oil mode and 8.53 kt/year for gas-operating mode. CO2 emission reduction per year due to gasification under realistic weather conditions could be up to 22 kt/year.

AB  - Direct splitting of earth-abundant seawater provides an eco-friendly route for the production of clean H2, but is hampered by selectivity and stability issues. Direct seawater electrolysis is the most established technology, attaining high current densities in the order of 1â€“2 A cmâˆ’2. Alternatively, light-driven processes such as photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical seawater splitting are particularly promising as well, as they rely on renewable solar power. Solar-to-Hydrogen efficiencies have increased over the past decade from negligible values to about 2%. Especially the absence of large local pH changes (in the order of several tenths of a pH unit compared to up to 9 pH units for electrolysis) is a strong asset for pure photocatalysis. This may lead to less adverse side-reactions such as Cl2 and ClOâˆ’ formation, (acid or base induced) corrosion and scaling. Besides, additional requirements for electrolytic cells, e.g. membranes and electricity input, are not needed in pure photocatalysis systems. In this review, the state-of-the-art technologies in light-driven seawater splitting are compared to electrochemical approaches with a focus on sustainability and stability. Promising advances are identified at the level of the catalyst as well as the process, and insight is provided in solutions crossing different fields. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

JO  - Energy Strategy Reviews

VL  - 21
IS  - NA
AB  - In the recent years, variable renewable energy (VRE) technologies - most importantly solar photovoltaics and wind power - have undergone a remarkable transformation from niche technologies to increasingly competitive energy suppliers. As the potential for VRE is distributed unevenly across Europe, a Europe-wide cost optimal expansion of VRE will lead to different national and regional expansion rates of VRE. To facilitate such a Europe-wide cost optimal expansion of VRE a fair cost distribution among all European countries is needed. Therefore, we analyse and discuss how expected future decreases in investment costs for selected VRE (photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, wind onshore, and wind offshore) will affect the pan-European and national electricity systems. This is done by comparing three cost scenarios with a reference case, calculated using a European electricity system model. Our results show that the assumed cost reductions lead to an especially pronounced increase of PV distributed unevenly across Europe. In addition, higher shares of VRE show the effect of shifting electricity exchange patterns throughout Europe which also reduce cost benefits for economies of electricity exporting countries. Hence, there might be a lack of agreement in Europe about where and how to expand and integrate VRE if costs of expanding and integrating VRE are not distributed in a fair way between the European countries. In addition, these possible barriers of expanding VRE Europe-wide in a cost-optimal way might hinder the exploitation of cost synergies or even slow down VRE expansion on a European scale.

This, it is argued, implies the wetlands are more resilient to future sea-level rise than previously thought and under conditions of continued acceleration, even more organic carbon will be stored. However, upon closer inspection, the study conclusions are flawed as they are based upon an inappropriate methodological approach to quantifying sediment and organic carbon accumulation rates and require an acceleration in the rate of historical (decades) sea-level rise of which there is limited evidence and no broad consensus.

JO  - Journal Of Cleaner Production

VL  - 200

AB  - Production of natural gas in deepwaters with high gas-to-oil ratio and high carbon dioxide (CO2) content challenges the design of offshore processing due to area and weight limitations. Furthermore, cleaner production and process sustainability impose sending the separated CO2 to early enhanced oil recovery, which has economic benefit but gradually increases %CO2 in raw gas, paralleled by decaying oil and gas flowrates. These conditions favor CO2 capture by membrane permeation (MP) for bulk removal and chemical absorption (CA) for polishing removal. Hybrid MP-CA has greater flexibility to face varying production and %CO2, demanding lifetime-oriented process design. CO2 production profile is estimated adopting %CO2 retained in source rock (0%, 60%) and gas flowrate predicted by empirical production decline curves. Under transient gas production MP area and operational conditions are optimized via non-linear programming at five points of process lifetime constrained by %CO2 in injected fluid above 75%mol. Treated gas reaches sale specification (%CO2 &lt; 3%mol) in the CA unit placed downstream MP. The obtained best design matched targets, but was more impacted by decreasing flowrate of raw gas than by increasing %CO2. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Global Marine Systems (GMS), an underwater cable company, built the Predator to help with operations on offshore wind farms. In order to make the Predator easier to maintain, GMS increased the number of components to make them easier to replace. For example, certain cables are held in place with two connectors rather than one so they can be removed without having to take the device apart further. The Predator is specifically designed to work in the difficult conditions associated with offshore wind farms. It has a high power-to-weight ratio to allow it to navigate strong currents and a number of integrated sensors to deal with low visibility. GMS is building five units to assist with the installation and repair of its cable laying and plans to use them on the planned London Array wind farm in the Thames Estuary and on a project in Asia. The unit is expected to sell for around Â£64,000.

JO  - Earth-science Reviews
PY  - 2021
VL  - 222
IS  - NA
AB  - The past two decades of research on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) seem to have finally become fruitful as global leaders and energy-intensive industries are cooperating to materialize CCS projects and reach the promised reduction in CO2 emissions. Traditionally, CCS projects targeted mostly high permeability sandstone formations, despite the numerous carbonate fields undergoing CO2 injection for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) in the United States or Canada. Because of the reactivity between calcite minerals and CO2 saturated water, chalk formations, characterized by high porosity and low permeability, have been previously portrayed as infeasible CO2 storage sites. Although previous laboratory investigations were carried out to assess the performance of CO2EOR in North Sea chalk fields, these studies did not result in any field-scale demonstration projects; this may soon change since a positive movement towards CO2 storage in depleted oil fields has been recently initiated. In this work, we reviewed existing studies on CO2 injection in chalk to address the suitability of this type of formation for CCS. Although the evidence on the thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical behaviour of chalk in the presence of CO2-saturated aqueous solutions is mixed, the majority of flooding tests performed on reservoir core samples do not support further weakening relative to water injection conditions nor significant changes in the petrophysical properties. Along with the weakening effect and using the Danish North Sea chalk fields as a case study, we addressed events that impact the storage site safety such as fault reactivation, and caprock and well integrity. Furthermore, monitoring techniques relevant to offshore locations are also discussed. Based on studies on other types of carbonates, and considering the characteristics of chalk (e.g., permeability, wettability, and reactivity) we analysed the relevance of different trapping mechanisms (i.e., solution, capillary, and mineral) but also several effects (i.e., chemical, biological, mechanical) that can lead to loss of injectivity. The main observations and conclusions in this work can be easily extrapolated to other chalk formations worldwide.

AB  - The maritime industry is seeking sustainability solutions, Pressure at an international level has added a line item to the signature coding for each ship to now include their status on "green" criteria. The ISO 30000 series standards cover ship recycling management systems, Green supply chain management (GSCM) has emerged as a key approach for enterprises seeking to become environmentally sustainable, especially in maritime transport sector which run 90% of the world trade. Nation's top freight transportation, the global supply chain management and the major ships designers gathered to provide the research, resources and education necessary to: The first, use less energy, including fuel and electricity, the second use less fresh water, plastic, paper and other consumables and the third reduce emissions that reduce the quality of its air. The main objective of this paper is to enhance the overall performance of Marine Diesel Engine power plant on board passenger ships through a proposed fresh water generator and combined heat and power system which minimize the fuel emission and improve the maritime supply chain transportation network. Fresh water produced will be used for drinking, cleaning and washing purposes contributing to the high demand consumption particularly on board passenger ships. The main idea for proposed fresh water generator is to use the waste heat recovered from scavenging air to provide the heat required to evaporate sea water under vacuum converting it into steam. Energy conservation system for exhaust gases in container ships has a lot of advantages which include, reducing fuel consumption for ships, increasing the overall efficiency, reducing the pollutant emissions which go out into the atmosphere, and saving lost money. Which minimize the fresh water supply by 8 tons/day. This amount will be sufficient for 20 persons per day. For a number of diesel engines equipped with the proposed fresh water generator the specific fresh water generation was found about 100 gm/hp/h.

AB  - Mangroves are among the world's most carbon-dense ecosystems, but have suffered extensive deforestation, prompting reforestation projects. The effects of mangrove reforestation on belowground carbon dynamics are poorly understood. In particular, we do not know how fine root production develops following mangrove reforestation, despite fine root production being a major carbon sink and an important control of mangrove soil accretion. Using minirhizotrons, we investigated fine root production and its depth variation along a chronosequence of mature Vietnamese mangroves. Our results showed that fine root production decreases strongly with stand age in the uppermost 32 cm of our soil profiles. In younger mangrove stands, fine root production declines with depth, possibly due to a vertical gradient in soil nutrient availability; while root production in the oldest stand is low at all depths and exhibits no clear vertical pattern. A major fraction of fine root production occurs deeper than 30 cm, depths that are commonly omitted from calculations of mangrove carbon budgets. Younger mangroves may accrue shallow soil organic matter faster than older mangroves. Therefore, root productivity and forest stand age should be accounted for when forecasting mangrove carbon budgets and resistance to sea-level rise.

TI  - Enhanced Lateral Exchange of Carbon and Nitrogen in a Coastal Wetland With Invasive Spartina alterniflora
JO  - Journal Of Geophysical Research-biogeosciences
PY  - 2020
VL  - 125
IS  - 5
AB  - Lateral movements of materials and energy in coastal wetlands, due mainly to tidal activities, have been recognized as key processes in understanding the biogeochemical cycles of ecosystems. However, our understanding of the roles of lateral movement in shaping ecosystem functions remains limited. Here we quantified the effects of lateral sediment transport on total carbon (C, inorganic + organic) and nitrogen (N) pools in plants and soils in two dominant wetland types: invasive Spartina alterniflora (Spartina) marshes and native Phragmites australis (Phragmites) marshes in coastal Shanghai of the Yangtze Estuary. We found that the accreted sediments across the water-marsh gradients caused by lateral movement resulted in contrasting C and N contents between the two communities. The sediment load and C and N pools in the plants and soils of the Spartina marshes were significantly higher than those in the adjacent Phragmites marshes. The shifts in species composition and community structure not only altered the C and N balance but also enhanced the ecosystem net primary productivity. Our findings highlight the importance of lateral transport in altering ecosystem structure after Spartina invasion. The ecosystem C and N pools were significantly higher in the invaded ecosystems than in the native community. Our study also reveals that the plant density and structures can alter tidal hydrodynamics and the lateral transportations of sediments, which in turn influence ecosystem C and N cycle. The C accumulation processes of the native and invaded marshes were further complicated by the contrasting productivities of the ecosystems.

TI  - Alternative Marine Fuel Research Advances and Future Trends: A Bibliometric Knowledge Mapping Approach
JO  - Sustainability
PY  - 2022
VL  - 14
IS  - 9
AB  - While the marine sector contributes significantly to the global economy, its environmental impact is a cause for apprehension due to growing concerns about ship emissions. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set decarbonization strategies consistent with sustainable development goals. The impending legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from maritime shipping by at least half by 2050 and to zero by the end of the century. A growing body of research has focused on alternative marine fuel selection; hence, this bibliometric review is timely. We assess the global scientific research on alternative marine fuel for knowledge mapping based on the articles available on the Scopus database since 1973. A total of 749 publications associated with alternative marine fuel has been subjected to a range of bibliometric analyses to explore this research field quantitatively and qualitatively. The study utilized the R-studio bibliometrics package and VOSviewer bibliometric tools to generate the results. The field of study has a growth rate of 7.05\%, having a significant contribution to knowledge from the USA, the United Kingdom, India, and China. Recent trends indicate that researchers are increasingly focused on alternative fuel oil choices. By analyzing commonly used keywords, it was possible to trace a multi-criteria decision analysis process that might be utilized to construct decision support systems for alternative maritime fuel selection. According to relevant articles, the research community has concentrated on the possibility of alternative fuels being utilized in place of traditional marine fuels to reduce emissions from the shipping sector from an environmental, technological, and economic standpoint. The current study offers an updated and comprehensive overview of research trends on alternative marine fuels. Researchers interested in data mapping work in this area can begin with this endeavor.

AB  - The accelerated rate of increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations in recent years and the inability of humankind to move away from carbon-based energy system have led to the revival of the idea of counteracting global warming through geoengineering schemes. Two categories of geoengineering proposals have been suggested: solar radiation management (SRM) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods. SRM schemes would attempt to reduce the amount of solar radiation absorbed by our planet. Placing reflectors or mirrors in space, injecting aerosols into the stratosphere, and enhancing the albedo of marine clouds are some of the proposed SRM methods. In this section, the various space-based SRM methods which are likely to reduce the incoming solar radiation uniformly across the globe are discussed. In the past decade, the effects of these space sunshades on the climate system have been simulated using climate models by reducing the amount of incoming solar radiation by appropriate amounts (reduced solar constant). Key modeling results on the extent of global and regional climate change mitigation, unintended side effects, and unmitigated effects are briefly discussed.

VL  - 238
IS  - NA
AB  - According to third IMO GHG Study shipping is responsible of about 2, 6% of world CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) emissions. The dangerous effect on people is increased because emissions are concentrated in coastal areas. IMO and other bodies are engaged in imposing measures to reduce GHG emissions and improve the overall ship's energy efficiency. There are many technical and operational improvements that can help to reach these goals, but hydrogen and fuel cells remain one of the best candidates to substantially reduce emissions and fuel consumption. This paper gives an outlook of possible fuel cells applications in the marine sector and analyses the potential of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) and Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) for the on-board installation. The analysis shows the advantages that fuel cells can give in terms of emissions reductions and fuel saving, but also highlights some challenges that designers will face when implementing these technologies on a cruise ship. Both PEMFC and SOFC application in the marine sector suffer of the lack of standards and regulations from IMO and Classification Societies and high acquisition cost. While PEMFC are ready for marine application, SOFC are still in a study phase for on-board implementation. Also, the type of fuel used by these generators and the possibility of heat recovery can influence their application on-board cruise ships. Â© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.

AB  - Under climate change scenarios, the contribution of macroalgae to carbon sequestration has attracted wide attention. As primary producers, macroalgae can release substantial amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in seawater. However, little is known about the molecular composition and chemical properties of DOC derived from macroalgae and which of them are recalcitrant DOC (RDOC) that can be sequestered for a long time in the ocean. In the most intensive seaweed (kelp) farming area (Sanggou Bay) in China, we found that kelp mariculture not only significantly increased DOC concentration, but also introduced a variety of new DOC molecular species, many of which were sulfur-containing molecules. A long-term DOC degradation experiment revealed that those DOC with strong resistance to microbial degradation, i.e., RDOC, account for approximately 58% of the DOC extracted from kelp mariculture area. About 85% (3587 out of 4224 with different chemical features) of the RDOC molecular species were steadily present throughout the long-term degradation process. 15% (637 out of 4224 with different chemical features) of the RDOC molecular species were likely newly generated by microorganisms after metabolizing macroalgae-derived labile DOC. All these stable RDOC should be included in the blue carbon budgets of seaweed. Â© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.

TI  - Lingering Carbon Cycle Effects of Hurricane Matthew in North Carolina's Coastal Waters
JO  - Geophysical Research Letters
PY  - 2019
VL  - 46
IS  - 5
AB  - In 2016, Hurricane Matthew accounted for 25\% of the annual riverine C loading to the Neuse River Estuary-Pamlico Sound, in eastern North Carolina. Unlike inland watersheds, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was the dominant component of C flux from this coastal watershed and stable carbon isotope and chromophoric dissolved organic matter evidence indicated the estuary and sound were dominated by wetland-derived terrigenous organic matter sources for several months following the storm. Persistence of wetland-derived DOC enabled its degradation to carbon dioxide (CO2), which was supported by sea-to-air CO2 fluxes measured in the sound weeks after the storm. Under future increasingly extreme weather events such as Hurricane Matthew, and most recently Hurricane Florence (September 2018), degradation of terrestrial DOC in floodwaters could increase flux of CO2 from estuaries and coastal waters to the atmosphere. Plain Language Summary Recent hurricanes along the Southeastern and Gulf coasts of the United States have received much attention, because these extreme events have led to immense societal and economic impacts. Wetlands in coastal watersheds store large amounts of organic matter and upon flooding during extreme weather events are poised to release this material into adjacent rivers and estuaries where its decomposition can generate carbon dioxide. Alteration of carbon balances in these events can shift impacted coastal ecosystems from states of carbon sinks to carbon sources for periods of weeks to months. Understanding the balance between these states is important to our understanding of how, and how long, regional carbon cycling is impacted after such extreme weather events. A biweekly record of dissolved and particulate organic matter quantity and quality from a coastal watershed in North Carolina in the 3months following Hurricane Matthew in 2016 illustrated a major input of wetland carbon to coastal waters caused by this storm and its substantial lingering effect on coastal carbon cycling.

TI  - AIR-SEA CO2 EXCHANGE AND DISSOLVED INORGANIC CARBON DISTRIBUTION IN AN INNER PART OF OSAKA BAY, JAPAN
JO  - NANA
PY  - 2020
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - The carbon captured by coastal oceans and ecosystems called blue carbon is attracting attention to reduce greenhouse gas. Recently, field surveys on air-sea CO2 exchange have been conducted in various coastal seas to reveal the blue carbon function. In this study, we investigated the vertical distribution of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) system in the inner part of Osaka Bay to reveal the air-sea CO2 exchange characteristics in port and harbor area. Field surveys were conducted on a vertical seawall in Naruo-hama of Osaka Bay, Japan, during 12 months from November 2014 to October 2015 and during summer from August to September 2016. The vertical distributions of DIC and pH were measured on site, and the CO2 partial pressure in water (pCO(2w)) was calculated based on carbon acid equilibrium. Water temperature, salinity and DO were also measured to examine the relationships the vertical distribution of DIC system and water mass structure. Furthermore, the air-sea CO2 flux (F-CO2) was estimated to examine the characteristics of the air-sea CO2 exchange. DIC ranged from 787 to 2,111 mu mol kg(-1), with seasonal and vertical change. DIC in the bottom layer increased during high water temperature period due to CO2 production by respiration and decomposition, and DIC accumulated along with formation density stratification. The correlation between DIC and pCO(2w) in surface layer was smaller than that in bottom layer because surface pCO(2w) fluctuated due to inflow of river water or seawater mixing. This study area acts as CO2 sinks under calm conditions (F-CO2 = -3.4 mmol-C m(-2) d(-1)), however the site acts CO2 sources (1) when density stratification was relaxed (F-CO2 = 2.1 mmol-C m(-2) d(-1)); (2) when water was mixed by disturbance such as typhoon (F-CO2 = 1.3 mmol-C m(-2) d(-1)); and (3) when it rained (F-CO2 = 15.5 mmol-C m(-2) d(-1)).

AB  - Reliability analysis of jacket type offshore wind turbine (OWT) support structure under extreme ocean environmental loads was performed. Limit state function (LSF) of OWT support structure is defined by using structural dynamic response at mud-line. Then, the dynamic response is expressed as the static response multiplied by peak response factor (PRF). Probabilistic distribution of PRF is found from response time history under design significant wave load. Band limited beta distribution is used for internal friction angle of ground soil. Wind load is obtained in the form of thrust force from commercial code called Bladed and then, applied to tower hub as random load. In numerical example, response surface method (RSM) is used to express LSF of jacket type support structure for 5 MW OWT. Reliability index is found using first order reliability method (FORM).

AB  - The total blue carbon stock of the Bangladesh Sundarban mangroves was evaluated and the probable future status after a century was predicted based on the recent trend of changes in the last 30 years and implementing a hybrid model of Markov Chain and Cellular automata. At present 36.24 Tg C and 54.95 Tg C are stored in the above-ground and below-ground compartments respectively resulting in total blue carbon stock of 91.19 Tg C. According to the prediction 15.88 Tg C would be lost from this region by the year 2115. The low saline species composition classes dominated mainly by Heritiera spp. accounts for the major portion of the carbon sock at present (45.60 Tg C), while the highly saline regions stores only 14.90 Tg C. The prediction shows that after a hundred years almost 22.42 Tg C would be lost from the low saline regions accompanied by an increase of 8.20 Tg C in the high saline regions dominated mainly by Excoecaria sp. and Avicennia spp. The net carbon loss would be due to both mangrove area loss (similar to 510 km(2)) and change in species composition leading to 58.28 Tg of potential CO2 emission within the year 2115.

TI  - Analysis of the Impact of Split Injection on Fuel Consumption and NOx Emissions of Marine Medium-Speed Diesel Engine
JO  - Journal Of Marine Science And Engineering
PY  - 2020
VL  - 8
IS  - 10
AB  - The medium-speed diesel engine in diesel-electric propulsion systems is increasingly used as the propulsion engine for liquefied natural gas (LNG) ships and passenger ships. The main advantage of such systems is high reliability, better maneuverability, greater ability to optimize and significant decreasing of the engine room volume. Marine propulsion systems are required to be as energy efficient as possible and to meet environmental protection standards. This paper analyzes the impact of split injection on fuel consumption and NOx emissions of marine medium-speed diesel engines. For the needs of the research, a zero-dimensional, two-zone numerical model of a diesel engine was developed. Model based on the extended Zeldovich mechanism was applied to predict NOx emissions. The validation of the numerical model was performed by comparing operating parameters of the basic engine with data from engine manufacturers and data from sea trials of a ship with diesel-electric propulsion. The applicability of the numerical model was confirmed by comparing the obtained values for pressure, temperature and fuel consumption. The operation of the engine that drives synchronous generator was simulated under stationary conditions for three operating points and nine injection schemes. The values obtained for fuel consumption and NOx emissions for different fuel injection schemes indicate the possibility of a significant reduction in NOx emissions but with a reduction in efficiency. The results showed that split injection with a smaller amount of pilot fuel injected and a smaller angle between the two injection allow a moderate reduction in NOx emissions without a significant reduction in efficiency. The application of split injection schemes that allow significant reductions in NOx emissions lead to a reduction in engine efficiency.

AB  - New regulations in the shipping sector aim to give greater transparency to operations and public access to CO2 emissions data. EU regulation 2015/757 became mandatory in January 2018 and urges shipping companies to set up systems for daily monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of emissions for individual ships. Manual acquisition and handling of emissions data may be allowed (e.g. bunker fuel delivery note, bunker fuel tank monitoring), but is adversely affected by uncertainty due to human intervention and will eventually be unusable for monitoring purposes. However, the massive amounts of navigation data acquired by multi-sensor systems installed on-board of modern ships have great potential to aid compliance with regulations but their use is hampered by the lack of effective analytical methods in the maritime literature. This work demonstrates a statistical framework and automatic reporting system for fuel consumption monitoring that addresses the MRV requirements needed to comply with the regulations. The framework has been applied to the Grimaldi Group's Ro-Ro Pax cruise ships and is shown, in addition, to be capable of supporting fault detection as well as verifying CO2 savings achieved after energy efficiency initiatives.

Consistent changes in the chemical and physical properties of these new fuels make classical maintenance methods as brake down or planned inadequate and endanger operational and navigational safety on ships. Within this framework, ship maintenance systems need to be reevaluated in accordance with the new marine fuels. In this study, firstly impacts of new marine fuels on ships have been evaluated by means of a literature review. Furthermore, repair and maintenance systems have been presented that are currently used on board ships. Subsequently, advantages of a predictive maintenance system that will reduce risk by constantly monitoring the potential critical characteristics of VLSFO over other maintenance systems have been discussed. Then, assessments of compliance fuel have been done in accordance with fuel properties, problems and corrective actions. Lastly, discussions and suggestions have been provided to the ship owners and technical managements.

AB  - As human populations have expanded, Earth's atmosphere and natural waters have become dumps for agricultural and industrial wastes. Remediation methods of the last half century have been largely unsuccessful. In many US watersheds, surface waters are eutrophic, and coastal water bodies, such as the Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, have become increasingly hypoxic. The algal turf scrubber (ATS) is an engineered system for flowing pulsed wastewaters over sloping surfaces with attached, naturally seeded filamentous algae. This treatment has been demonstrated for tertiary sewage, farm wastes, streams, and large aquaculture systems; rates as large as 40 million to 80 million liters per day (lpd) are routine. Whole-river-cleaning systems of 12 billion lpd are in development. The algal biomass, produced at rates 5 to 10 times those of other types of land-based agriculture, can be fermented, and significant research and development efforts to produce ethanol, butanol, and methane are under way. Unlike with algal photobioreactor systems, the cost of producing biofuels from the cleaning of wastewaters by ATS can be quite low.

TI  - Carbon stocks of intact mangroves and carbon emissions arising from their conversion in the Dominican Republic
JO  - Ecological Applications
PY  - 2014
VL  - 24
IS  - 3
AB  - Mangroves are recognized to possess a variety of ecosystem services including high rates of carbon sequestration and storage. Deforestation and conversion of these ecosystems continue to be high and have been predicted to result in significant carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Yet few studies have quantified the carbon stocks or losses associated with conversion of these ecosystems. In this study we quantified the ecosystem carbon stocks of three common mangrove types of the Caribbean as well as those of abandoned shrimp ponds in areas formerly occupied by mangrove-a common land-use conversion of mangroves throughout the world. In the mangroves of the Montecristi Province in Northwest Dominican Republic we found C stocks ranged from 706 to 1131 Mg/ha. The medium-statured mangroves (3-10 m in height) had the highest C stocks while the tall (&gt;10 m) mangroves had the lowest ecosystem carbon storage. Carbon stocks of the low mangrove (shrub) type (&lt;3 m) were relatively high due to the presence of carbon-rich soils as deep as 2 m. Carbon stocks of abandoned shrimp ponds were 95 Mg/ha or âˆ¼11% that of the mangroves. Using a stock-change approach, the potential emissions from the conversion of mangroves to shrimp ponds ranged from 2244 to 3799 Mg CO2e/ha (CO2 equivalents). This is among the largest measured C emissions from land use in the tropics. The 6260 ha of mangroves and converted mangroves in the Montecristi Province are estimated to contain 3 841 490 Mg of C. Mangroves represented 76% of this area but currently store 97% of the carbon in this coastal wetland (3 696 722 Mg C). Converted lands store only 4% of the total ecosystem C (144 778 Mg C) while they comprised 24% of the area. By these metrics the replacement of mangroves with shrimp and salt ponds has resulted in estimated emissions from this region totaling 3.8 million Mg CO2e or âˆ¼21% of the total C prior to conversion. Given the high C stocks of mangroves, the high emissions from their conversion, and the other important functions and services they provide, their inclusion in climate-change mitigation strategies is warranted.

AB  - This paper concentrates on low-speed surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous generator (LS-SMPMSG) electromagnetic design using finite-element (FEM)-based method. The introduced LS-SMPMSG is utilized in marine energy conversion (MEC) and tidal energy conversion (TEC) systems. The main feature of the designed LS-SMPMSG is its ability to generate electrical power in MEC and TEC systems at a low speed of approximately 100 rpm. In the second part, a new slot structure for LS-YYSMPMSG has been proposed to enhance the LS-SMPMSG performance. The FEM analysis shows that the new slot structure led to reducing the torque ripple and the cogging torque equal to 19.54\% and 87.5\% respectively. Also, it influenced the LS-SMPMSG Joule losses by 16.1\% reduction. Another advantage of the new slot structure of LS-SMPMSG is its easy construction and assembly. The FEM analysis validates the advantages of the proposed structure.

AB  - Background and aims In recent decades, temperate herbaceous wetlands have been widely experiencing shrub encroachment. By now, little has been known about whether such alteration in plant community would generate updated soil organic carbon (SOC) conservation strategies, and thus alter SOC dynamics. Methods To assess the temporal dynamics of SOC stock and fractions after shrub encroachment into temperate herbaceous wetlands, we measured floor litter mass, fine root biomass, and SOC stock and fractions (i.e. labile C pool I, labile C pool II, and recalcitrant C pool) across the 0-50 cm soil profile in the open wetlands and shrub islands (Betula fruticose and Salix floderusii) with different basal diameter sizes (small, 10 similar to 15 cm; medium, 15 similar to 20 cm; and large, 20 similar to 30 cm) in the Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China. Results Regardless of shrub species, SOC stock initially decreased after shrub expansion, but gradually recovered to the initial level of herbaceous wetlands. Moreover, SOC stock correlated positively with fine root biomass, but showed no significant relationship with floor litter mass. The responses of SOC fractions to shrub expansion mainly occurred in the surface soils (0-15 cm), despite a slight change in recalcitrant C pool in 15-50 cm layer. In the surface soils, labile C pool decreased substantially, whereas recalcitrant C pool and recalcitrant index of SOC elevated with increasing shrub sizes. Conclusions Shrub encroachment can recover SOC pool and enhance SOC recalcitrance in temperate herbaceous wetlands, and altered fine root biomass would account for shrub encroachment-induced SOC dynamics.

TI  - Modeling the tetraspar floating offshore wind turbine foundation as a flexible structure in orcaflex and openfast
JO  - Energies
PY  - 2021
VL  - 14
IS  - 23
AB  - Floating offshore wind turbine technology has seen an increasing and continuous development in recent years. When designing the floating platforms, both experimental and numerical tools are applied, with the latter often using time-domain solvers based on hydro-load estimation from a Morison approach or a boundary element method. Commercial software packages such as OrcaFlex, or open-source software such as OpenFAST, are often used where the floater is modeled as a rigid six degree-of-freedom body with loads applied at the center of gravity. However, for final structural design, it is necessary to have information on the distribution of loads over the entire body and to know local internal loads in each component. This paper uses the TetraSpar floating offshore wind turbine design as a case study to examine new modeling approaches in OrcaFlex and OpenFAST that provide this information. The study proves the possibility of applying the approach and the extraction of internal loads, while also presenting an initial code-to-code verification between OrcaFlex and OpenFAST. As can be expected, comparing the flexible model to a rigid-body model proves how motion and loads are affected by the flexibility of the structure. OrcaFlex and OpenFAST generally agree, but there are some differences in results due to different modeling approaches. Since no experimental data are available in the study, this paper only forms a baseline for future studies but still proves and describes the possibilities of the approach and codes.

VL  - 6
IS  - NA
AB  - The potential power generation at Gozo North-Offshore was estimated for a hypothetical wind farm composed of 21 x 2MW wind turbines that can be accommodated within the site constraints. Wind from directions that are not influenced by the landmass - 270Â° (due west) through 0Â° (north) to 120Â° (east south-east) would generate 100 GWh annually, or 4.3% of power station generation. The particular direction - north-westerly - contributes 71.5 GWh emphasising the particular local wind regime. Wind from directions that may be affected by the landmass, i.e. 120Â° (east south-east) to 270Â° (due west), would have a potential of 48 GWh. It is recommended that the potential be confirmed through wind measurements at a representative point such as the seaward edge of il-Qortin tan-Nadur on the north Gozo shoreline.

AB  - The decarbonisation of energy sources requires additional investments in renewable technologies, including the installation of onshore and offshore wind farms. For wind energy to remain competitive, wind farms must continue to provide low-cost power even when covering larger areas. Inside very large wind farms, winds can decrease considerably from their free-stream values to a point where an equilibrium wind speed is reached. The magnitude of this equilibrium wind speed is primarily dependent on the balance between turbine drag force and the downward momentum influx from above the wind farm. We have simulated for neutral atmospheric conditions, the wind speed field inside different wind farms that range from small (25 km2) to very large (105 km2) in three regions with distinct wind speed and roughness conditions. Our results show that the power density of very large wind farms depends on the local free-stream wind speed, the surface characteristics, and the turbine density. In onshore regions with moderate winds the power density of very large wind farms reaches 1 W m-2, whereas in offshore regions with very strong winds it exceeds 3 W m-2. Despite a relatively low power density, onshore regions with moderate winds offer potential locations for very large wind farms. In offshore regions, clusters of smaller wind farms are generally preferable; under very strong winds also very large offshore wind farms become efficient. Â© 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In India, there are plans for 5 GW of installed capacity of wind power by 2022. This study establishes that the wind resource along the west coast of Gujarat is sufficient for offshore wind farms of between 500 MW to 2 GW rated power to be operated with capacity factors of 40% to 54%. For the majority of sites, a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) in the range 68 to 86 Â£/MWh can be achieved with installation on floating support structures. The LCOE is up to 3.2 Â£/MWh greater for installation on bed-fixed structures closer to shore. The wind resource and energy yield are predicted using Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF). Wind speed occurrence is predicted to within 1.3% for multiple sites simultaneously, and this provides wind turbine energy yield to within 3.4%. Wind speeds occurring due to sea breeze are accurately predicted and contribute 6.2% of annual energy generation at the nearshore locations and 3.8% at the deeper water offshore sites. While these events improve the viability of nearshore locations, floating installations offer lower LCOE for most locations along the Gujarat coast. Â© 2020 The Authors.

JO  - Asia Pacific Viewpoint

AB  - Peatlands play a crucial role in Indonesia's economic development, and in its stated goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Improved peatland management - including a national moratorium on the granting of any new conversion licenses - forms a cornerstone of Indonesia's climate change mitigation commitment. At the same time, rapid expansion of the plantation sector is driving wide-scale drainage and conversion of peat swamp ecosystems. The province of Riau, in central Sumatra, finds itself at the crossroads of these conflicting agendas. This essay presents a case study of three islands on Riau's east coast affected by industrial timber plantation concessions. It examines the divergent experiences, perceptions and responses of communities on the islands. A mix of dramatic protests, localised everyday actions and constructive dialogue has succeeded in delaying or perhaps halting one of the concessions, while negotiations and contestation with the other two continue. With the support of regional and national non-governmental organisations and local government, communities are pursuing alternative development strategies, including the cultivation of sago, which requires no peat drainage. While a powerful political economy of state and corporate actors shapes the contours of socio-environmental change, local social movements can alter trajectories of change, promoting incremental improvements and alternative pathways.

TI  - Development of a novel kinetic hydrate inhibitor and corrosion inhibitor package for wet gas application
JO  - Proceedings Of The Annual Offshore Technology Conference
PY  - 2013
VL  - 2
IS  - NA
AB  - A dual functional kinetic hydrate inhibitor (KHI) and compatible corrosion inhibitor (CI) package was developed to simplify production chemistry demands for operation in wet gas mode. As these two classes of chemistries are both water soluble and contain surface active components, they have a tendency for interference reducing the efficacy of each inhibitor. Their pairing in a production scenario requires both comprehensive performance testing as well as extensive secondary properties evaluation. The KHI is to serve as a traditional KHI during steady-state operations while performing as a thermodynamic hydrate inhibitor (THI) during extended shut-ins and cold well restarts. This challenge required the development of a KHI which would retain performance upon significant dilution in a thermodynamic hydrate inhibitor solvent carrier (methanol, ethanol, monoethylene glycol, etc). Performance of this new KHI would be confirmed in blind rocking cell experiments, in the presence of the matched corrosion inhibitor, targeting a hold time of more than eight days at a subcooling of 8CÂ°. The CI is targeted to reduce the general corrosion rate to less than 0.1 mmpy and prevent localized attack. Due to the surfactancy of this class of chemistry, the tendency to induce and stabilize emulsions is of high concern. A robust formulation amenable to modification and potential dilution is required to address the application of chemical over a vast subsea network containing wells of varying age,existing infrastructure, production profiles, and operating conditions. This paper describes the development, qualification process, related lessons learned, and field applications of this new KHI/CI package. Copyright 2013, Offshore Technology Conference.

JO  - Proceedings Of The International Offshore And Polar Engineering Conference
PY  - 2017
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) in International Maritime Organization (IMO) is regulating the CO2 emission from vessels by an established index called the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI). The EEDI is applied to every ocean-going vessel and ratified to be stringent with respect to time; the CO2 emission should be reduced by 30 % in 2022 (Phase 3) and by 40 % in 2025 (Phase 4) from the emission level of 2013. Although the LNG-fuelled propulsion system has been developed to reduce the green-house gas emission, it hardly meet the regulation in Phase 4, and consequently some fuel without green-house gas emission should be combined with LNG. This study proposes the LNG-hydrogen hybrid system of a LNG carrier with 154K, 210K, and 267K cargo capacity and discusses some issues including the relative ratio of hydrogen with respect to LNG, the size of hydrogen fuel tanks, and operating complexities to satisfy the step-by-step regulations. An appropriate ratio of hydrogen fuel to satisfy the environmental regulation is estimated to more than 12% and 27% for Phase 4 and 5 respectively. The tank size of liquid hydrogen for the ship is estimated 1,300 âˆ¼ 3,300 m3, and the power of a fuel cell is required to be 4.9 âˆ¼ 11.8 MW. Optimising the hybrid propulsion system considering the spatial, operational, and economic feasibility for the hybrid propulsion system is identified as a future challenge.

AB  - On the continental margins and in permafrost regions, natural gas such as methane, ethane, propane and large hydrocarbons, which has been expected to replace petroleum energy, exists in solid hydrate form. Because of huge amounts of natural gas in the solid form of Natural Gas Hydrate (NGH), the effective recovery of natural gas from NGH becomes the most important factor on evaluating the economic feasibility in the sense of commercialization. If NGHs could be transformed into CO2 hydrates, they would suggest double opportunities as energy sources and global warming gas storage sites. Herein, we report the Dual CO2 sequestration and CH4 recovery phenomena occurring in NGH layers including sI, sII and sH. For sI CH 4 hydrate, the resulting outcome of 64% and 85% CH4 recovery rate achieved by the direct use of CO2 and N 2/CO2 mixtures (8:2) was reported by using Gas Chromatography (GC). In the case of sII and sH CH4 hydrates, we report dual structure transition to si during swapping phenomena and a cage-specific distribution of guest molecules. A significant change of structure transition due to CO2s attack induces the considerable increase of CH4 recovery rate.

PY  - 2013

IS  - PART A2
AB  - The maritime traffic is the real backbone of the international transport of goods in the world and it is driven by a severe observance of time scheduling. Nevertheless, mainly in relation with the most traveled routes, frequently it might happen that port facilities are congested, and the time schedule for ship load/unload operations is accordingly delayed. In this circumstance the choice is between meeting the original ETA (estimated time of arrival) and then let the ship riding at anchor or slowing down the ship in order to adjust the arrival to the actually needed time window. The latter option is called "Virtual Arrival"[l] because it consists of applying a speed reduction that fits the new time for port operations instead of arriving at the original ETA. The purpose of this paper is to investigate to what extent the Virtual Arrival policy could be a valuable option providing a reasonable energy saving for ships. The potential benefits are considerable and they result in direct saving in fuel consumption, reduction of C02 emissions and less congested port areas.

TI  - Plant invasion reshapes the latitudinal pattern of soil microbial necromass and its contribution to soil organic carbon in coastal wetlands
JO  - Catena
PY  - 2023
VL  - 222
IS  - NA
AB  - An emerging consensus is reached that microbial necromass carbon (MNC) significantly contributes to the for-mation and stabilization of soil organic carbon (SOC). Yet less is known about how plant invasion regulates MNC accumulation in coastal ``Blue Carbon{''} ecosystems, and the environmental and microbial controls on MNC distribution across large scales are not well revealed. Here, we evaluated the contribution of MNC to SOC across a broad scale in coastal habitats including salt marshes and mangroves before and after exotic Spartina alterniflora Loisel. invasion. Specifically, we explored the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on soil MNC accumulation in paired native and invaded soils. The MNC pool was quantitatively inferred by analyzing soil microbial amino sugar content. We found that soil MNC contents significantly increased from temperate salt marshes to tropical mangroves, and the average MNC in mangrove soils was 1.3-5.0 times that in salt marshes. In native soils, the estimated contribution of MNC to SOC decreased along the climatic gradient, ranging from 13.4\% to 61.2\%. However, the invasion homogenized the latitudinal variation of MNC/SOC as the invasion reduced the contri-bution of soil MNC to SOC in salt marshes but increased the accumulation of microbial residues in mangrove habitats. Furthermore, MNC derived from fungi was 3.6-19.0 times that of bacteria and the contribution of fungal MNC to total MNC decreased against the increasing mean annual temperatures. The soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and soil texture had significant negative effects on MNC/SOC, indicating that soil nutrient sta-tus and physical protection are vital abiotic controls in regulating MNC accumulation in coastal wetlands. In summary, these findings revealed that MNC considerably contributes to soil carbon sequestration in coastal ecosystems, and emphasized that plant invasion can change the latitudinal pattern of MNC accumulation by altering environmental and microbial attributes and thus influencing soil carbon stabilization.

AB  - This paper presents the DC fault transient study of a meshed DC grid with high-temperature superconducting (HTS) HVDC cables to integrate offshore wind power. A four-terminal meshed DC grid model with a Â±100 kV DC voltage rating is developed. DC circuit breakers (DCCBs) are implemented in the DC grid to deal with DC cable faults. To conduct the fault transient study, the fault scenarios with different fault locations and protection delays are studied. The sensitivity study versus different DC fault locations reveals that the faults on the faulted cable will not cause the quenching of healthy cables. The sensitivity study considering different DC fault protection delays demonstrates that the HTS cables have a current-limiting effect and the long delay of DC fault protection does not result in large fault current and the quenching of healthy cables. Extensive simulations in PSCAD/EMTDC validate the founding. Â© 1986-2012 IEEE.

TI  - CO2 Storage in Saline Aquifers: In the Southern North Sea and Northern Germany
JO  - NANA
PY  - 2009
VL  - 1
IS  - 1
AB  - CO2 storage in depleted gas fields is attractive but gas fields are unequally distributed geographically and can be utilized only within a restricted window of opportunity. Therefore, CO2 storage in saline aquifers can be expected to become an important element of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) systems. CO2 storage in saline aquifers is studied in the European DYNAMIS project, where special attention was paid to the relation between the geological structure, geological properties and achievable injection rates. This paper presents the results from simulations of CO2 storage in two aquifer structures. One aquifer structure is located in the English sector of the Southern North Sea and one aquifer structure located in Northern Germany. The geological model of the Southern North Sea structure was built using existing knowledge of facies geometry and distribution from literature and well logs and the overall geometry from interpreted horizons. The distributions of properties like lithology, net-to-gross ratios, porosity and permeability were stochastically modelled to represent the braided and meandering river and fan systems within the Bunter Sandstone Formation. High-porosity and high-permeability zones model fluvial channels running through the reservoir. A different approach was chosen for the North German structure. Because there is no information on the facies or petrophysical parameter distribution of the aquifer, three different model scenarios were generated. One model was created with homogeneous properties throughout the aquifer. Two other model scenarios were generated allowing the porosity and permeability to vary within certain ranges. This was done using a sequential Gaussian simulation with the known mean, minimum and maximum values of porosity and permeability, respectively. Due to the size of the aquifer structures and computing limits, up-scaling of the geological model of the Southern North Sea was required. The up-scaling was aimed to retain as much as possible of the modelled geological features such as braided river and fan systems. Several reservoir simulations were carried out in collaboration between TNO and IFP to assess CO2 injection. Given the injection rate constraints, the aim of the injection simulations was to: assess the achievable rate of injection; study the migration and behavior of the CO2 in the reservoir; assess the most appropriate location(s) for the CO2 injection wells using alternate injection strategies. The injection strategy is relevant especially for the Southern North Sea structure, where river and fan systems may results in high-permeability zones through the reservoir. Accessing such systems may significantly improve a reservoir's value for CO2 storage. The effect of such systems on the injection rates is demonstrated. The reservoir simulations also demonstrate the injection rates that can be achieved in tight reservoirs as in the North Germany case, and the effect of spatial variability of geological parameters. This will show whether it is reasonable to assume spatial geological homogeneity, when data on the reservoir formation are scarce. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved

JO  - Nature Geoscience
PY  - 2013
VL  - 6
IS  - 9
AB  - Coastal upwelling regimes associated with eastern boundary currents are the most biologically productive ecosystems in the ocean. As a result, they play a disproportionately important role in the microbially mediated cycling of marine nutrients. These systems are characterized by strong natural variations in carbon dioxide concentrations, pH, nutrient levels and sea surface temperatures on both seasonal and interannual timescales. Despite this natural variability, changes resulting from human activities are starting to emerge. Carbon dioxide derived from fossil fuel combustion is adding to the acidity of upwelled low-pH waters. Low-oxygen waters associated with coastal upwelling systems are growing in their extent and intensity as a result of a rise in upper ocean temperatures and productivity. And nutrient inputs to the coastal ocean continue to grow. Coastal upwelling systems may prove more resilient to changes resulting from human activities than other ocean ecosystems because of their ability to function under extremely variable conditions. Nevertheless, shifts in primary production, fish yields, nitrogen gain and loss, and the flux of climate-relevant gases could result from the perturbation of these highly productive and dynamic ecosystems.

AB  - Ricardo, a consulting engineering firm, is renowned in marine diesel engine circles. The company works closely with several major large engine companies, and such work has increased in both volume and importance as rising fuel costs and tighter emission regulations have forced engine designers as well as vessel operators to look towards ever more radical solutions to raising efficiency without compromising cleanliness. The company is exploring advanced technology in the whole power and propulsion system. Advanced computer modeling and simulation technology permits relevant and in-depth research and development into fuel cell and hybrid technology using various techniques, in some cases executed in real time. The company sees considerable potential in radial turbines, bottoming- or organic-Rankine cycles, and split cycle regenerative engine technologies. Other current activities include research into true hybrid technologies for ship propulsion. Battery-based systems are an obvious choice, similar to those used in hybrid road vehicles, but batteries have proved less than ideal in marine applications. They are heavy, bulky, and costly in terms of initial investment and replacement. Fuel reforming has been a significant part of Ricardo's work. Energy recovery and energy storage technologies also have promising applications in the marine sector. However, as with most technologies, existing hybrid propulsion technology is cost effective up to a point, but becomes a very costly option as higher levels of CO2 reduction are demanded. Thus, Ricardo investigated other energy storage technologies. The most promising of which are hydraulics, ultra-capacitors, and flywheels, which all tend to score more highly than electro-chemical solutions - particularly flywheel.

In this study, global efforts in tackling climate change are summarized using a timeline approach, which includes the important outcomes of the United Nations Climate Change Conference and the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting. Then, aiming at the energy efficiency operational indicator proposed by the IMO, the mechanism analysis method is used to summarize the influencing factors of the ship's energy efficiency.

AB  - Hydrogen, as a maritime fuel, is one of the solutions that will assist the shipping sector in addressing the challenges regarding decarbonization, taking into consideration the targets set for 2030 and 2050. The extensive utilization of hydrogen requires massive production of green hydrogen and the development of proper infrastructure to support a sustainable supply chain. An alternative solution is based on the on-board production of hydrogen, where production units are installed on-board the vessel. Along these lines, the HYMAR project aims to test the utilization of a hydrogen production unit for on-board use. The article deals with the use of hydrogen as a fuel for internal combustion engines, taking into consideration reports from literature and the preliminary results of the HYMAR project, focusing on the environmental impact and the reduction in emissions.

AB  - In order to develop energy management systems for hybrid ship propulsion plants that are truly optimal and robust, it is important that the test conditions in experimental facilities are as close as possible to real world applications. In this context, a framework for the design and experimental evaluation of power-split control systems for ship propulsion is proposed. Using machine learning, data from ship operation are processed and 20 loading patterns are recognized; representative templates are extracted to be used as marine loading cycles in the energy management system development and testing. A ship propulsion model with wave disturbance is utilized to simulate realistic loading scenarios on the experimental facility. A predictive energy management system is presented, that controls the diesel engine and the electric motor/generator based on a strategy that defines the trade-off between fuel consumption and NOx emissions minimization. In addition the propeller load characteristics that are estimated and a speed predictor are utilized to aid the optimization within the 10 s prediction time window. A parametric simulation study is performed for the trade-off evaluation between fuel consumption and NOx emissions reduction potential of the control scheme. Finally, utilizing an extracted loading cycle, the energy management system is experimentally implemented and tested in real-time operation, where it has to cope with environmental disturbance rejection and follow the desired speed profile while performing the power-split control in respect to the fuel to NOx weighting strategy. Based on the experimental results in a hybrid dieselâ€“electric marine powertrain with a 260 kW diesel engine and a 90 kW electric machine, fuel consumption and NOx emissions reduction by 6% and 8.5% respectively, were achieved over the tested profile. In this framework, the capabilities of the energy management system in realistic operation conditions can be exploited and evaluated. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

JO  - Applied Energy
PY  - 2018
VL  - 212
IS  - NA
AB  - Current trends in both commercial and military ship development have focused on ship electrification. A challenge for electric-ship propulsion systems, however, is large propulsion-load fluctuations. To address this issue, this paper explores a new solution, namely a combined battery and flywheel (B/FW) hybrid energy storage system (HESS) as a buffer to isolate load fluctuations from the shipboard network. Our two main objectives, power-fluctuation compensation and energy saving under various operating constraints, are formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. Pareto fronts, which illustrate the trade-offs between the main objectives, are obtained by using dynamic programming with the weighted sum method. To quantitatively analyze the performance of B/FW HESS, a comparative study is performed under different sea conditions, where a battery/ultra-capacitor (B/UC) HESS configuration is used as a reference in performance evaluation. Simulation results show the feasibility and effectiveness of B/FW to mitigate the load fluctuations for all-electric ships, especially at high sea states. Furthermore, a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is developed to facilitate real-time implementation of the proposed solution. A performance comparison between the proposed MPC energy management strategy and the global dynamic programming is performed, and this comparison demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed MPC strategy.

TI  - Molecular profiling of an oleaginous trebouxiophycean alga Parachlorella kessleri subjected to nutrient deprivation for enhanced biofuel production
JO  - Biotechnology For Biofuels
PY  - 2019
VL  - 12
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Decreasing fossil fuels and its impact on global warming have led to an increasing demand for its replacement by sustainable renewable biofuels. Microalgae may offer a potential feedstock for renewable biofuels capable of converting atmospheric CO2 to substantial biomass and valuable biofuels, which is of great importance for the food and energy industries. Parachlorella kessleri, a marine unicellular green alga belonging to class Trebouxiophyceae, accumulates large amount of lipids under nutrient-deprived conditions. The present study aims to understand the metabolic imprints in order to elucidate the physiological mechanisms of lipid accumulations in this microalga under nutrient deprivation. Results: Molecular profiles were obtained using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of P. kessleri subjected to nutrient deprivation. Relative quantities of more than 60 metabolites were systematically compared in all the three starvation conditions. Our results demonstrate that in lipid metabolism, the quantities of neutral lipids increased significantly followed by the decrease in other metabolites involved in photosynthesis, and nitrogen assimilation. Nitrogen starvation seems to trigger the triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation rapidly, while the microalga seems to tolerate phosphorous limitation, hence increasing both biomass and lipid content. The metabolomic and lipidomic profiles have identified a few common metabolites such as citric acid and 2-ketoglutaric acid which play significant role in diverting flux towards acetyl-CoA leading to accumulation of neutral lipids, whereas other molecules such as trehalose involve in cell growth regulation, when subjected to nutrient deprivation. Conclusions: Understanding the entire system through qualitative (untargeted) metabolome approach in P. kessleri has led to identification of relevant metabolites involved in the biosynthesis and degradation of precursor molecules that may have potential for biofuel production, aiming towards the vision of tomorrow's bioenergy needs.

AB  - A new type of the wave energy converter called a submergible point absorber using oscillating water column (SPA-OWC) is presented. SPA-OWC is an axisymmetric device consisting basically of a submerged vertical tail tube open at both ends, fixed to a lid having an open bottom to the sea. It seems to be quite similar to the spar-buoy. However, the air chamber of the SPA-OWC is not exposed to the atmosphere so there is no restriction of the installation location. That is, this device can be floating or submerged. Furthermore, the body of SPA-OWC is not necessary to move essentially in heave. Therefore, easy access for maintenance is guaranteed, and it may be free to choose an installation method among the tight-mooring, slack-mooring, or standing on a sea-bed. The dynamics of SPA-OWC is analyzed in the frequency domain and the theoretical performance is computed using ANSYS AQWA to prove its feasibility.

AB  - The EU Regulation 2015/757 established a monitoring, reporting and verification (EU MRV) mechanism for CO2 emissions from shipping. Certainly, given the international nature of shipping, the optimum solution would be to introduce appropriate mechanisms within the framework of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). However, the IMO Data Collection System for ship fuel oil consumption data (IMO DCS), established in 2016 and similar to the EU MRV mechanism, has not been perceived as sufficient given the EU's ambitions to achieve swift decarbonisation of maritime transport. The fragmentation of greenhouse gas emission regulation has also consequences for the Port State Control inspections. The article explores the EU MRV and IMO DCS co-existence in terms of financial penalties and other types of sanctions in case of non-compliance with the EU MRV or IMO DCS obligations.

TI  - Integration of solid oxide fuel cell and internal combustion engine for maritime applications
JO  - Applied Energy
PY  - 2021
VL  - 281
IS  - NA
AB  - The current literature on solid oxide fuel cell and internal combustion engine (SOFC-ICE) integration is focused on the application of advanced combustion technologies operating as bottoming cycles to generate a small load share. This integration approach can pose challenges for ships such as restricted dynamic capabilities and large space and weight requirements. Furthermore, the potential of SOFC-ICE integration for marine power generation has not been explored. Consequently, the current work proposes a novel approach of SOFC-ICE integration for maritime applications, which allows for high-efficiency power generation while the SOFC anode-off gas (AOG) is blended with natural gas (NG) and combusted in a marine spark-ignited (SI) engine for combined power generation. The objective of this paper is to investigate the potential of the proposed SOFC-ICE integration approach with respect to system efficiency, emissions, load sharing, space and weight considerations and load response. In this work, a verified zero-dimensional (0-D) SOFC model, engine experiments and a validated AOG-NG mean value engine model is used. The study found that the SOFC-ICE integration, with a 67â€“33 power split at 750 kWe power output, yielded the highest efficiency improvement of 8.3% over a conventional marine natural gas engine. Simulation results showed that promising improvements in efficiency of 5.2%, UHC and NOx reductions of about 30% and CO2 reductions of about 12% can be achieved from a 33â€“67 SOFC-ICE power split with comparatively much smaller increments in size and weight of 1.7 times. Furthermore, the study concluded that in the proposed SOFC-ICE system for maritime applications, a power split that favours the ICE would significantly improve the dynamic capabilities of the combined system and that the possible sudden and large load changes can be met by the ICE.

VL  - 147
IS  - NA
AB  - Large-scale nutrient fertilisation by coastal upwelling promotes benthic productivity through energy subsidies from enhanced phytoplankton production, and predictions of alterations to upwelling under climate change have implications for benthic ecosystem functioning. We investigated the stable isotope compositions of two bioengineers of global significance, the mussels Perna perna and Mytilus galloprovincialis, from upwelling and non-upwelling sites in five upwelling systems. Samples from Brazil, South Africa and Oman exhibited lower Î´13C values at upwelling sites than at non-upwelling sites, with clearer effects where upwelling is more intense and frequent. North West Africa showed variability, probably linked to Saharan dust input. We highlight the importance of upwelling to sustaining benthic primary consumers and the sensitivity of consumer diet to the intensity and frequency of upwelling within each region. These results have implications in relation to climate change scenario effects on upwelling events, with potential cascading effects on higher trophic levels and ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Assessing the long-term carbon-sequestration potential of the semi-natural salt marshes in the European Wadden Sea
JO  - Ecosphere
PY  - 2019
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - Salt marshes and other blue carbon ecosystems have been increasingly recognized for their carbon (C)-sink function. Yet, an improved assessment of organic carbon (OC) stocks and C-sequestration rates is still required to include blue C in C-crediting programs. Particularly, factors inducing variability in the permanence of sequestration and allochthonous contributions to soil OC stocks require an improved understanding. This study evaluates the potential for long-term C sequestration in the semi-natural salt marshes of the European Wadden Sea (WS), conducting deep (1.3 m) down-core OC-density assessments in sites with known site histories and accretion records. Because these young marshes have developed from tidal-flat ecosystems and have undergone rapid succession during the last 80-120 yr, the identification of different ecosystem stages down-core was crucial to interpret possible changes in OC density. This was conducted based on the down-core distribution of different foraminiferal taxa and grain sizes. Comparisons of historic and recent accretion rates were conducted to understand possible effects of accretion rate on down-core changes in OC density. delta C-13 in OC was used to assess the origin of accumulated OC (autochthonous vs. allochthonous sources). We show that large amounts of short-term accumulated OC are lost down-core in the well-aerated marsh soils of the WS region and thus emphasize the importance of deep sampling to avoid overestimation of C sequestration. Despite steep declines in OC-density down-core, minimum values of OC density in the salt-marsh soils were considerably higher than those of the former tidal-flat sediments that the marshes were converted from, illustrating the greater C-sequestration potential of the vegetated ecosystem. However, our data also suggest that marine-derived allochthonous OC makes up a large fraction of the effectively, long-term preserved OC stock, whereas atmospheric CO2 removal by marsh vegetation contributes relatively little. The implication of this finding for C-crediting approaches in blue C ecosystems has yet to be clarified.

PY  - 2020
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - The Antarctic rocky coasts are mainly colonized by extensive seaweed communities, which play key roles as food resource, habitat, and refuge for many benthic and pelagic organisms. Due to climate warming, Antarctic marine ecosystems are being affected by glacier retreat opening new habitats, e.g., newly ice-free areas that can be colonized by macroalgae. As a consequence, primary production and fate of macroalgae are changing in these new polar environments. In these ecosystems, the carbon production, especially from large brown algae, is an important food source to the benthic invertebrate communities mainly when other resources are scarce. Thus, in new areas colonized by seaweeds, the trophic structure and biogeochemical fluxes can vary considerably. Moreover, when seaweeds die or are removed by water movement, ice scouring, or storms, they are detached, fragmented, and degraded, incorporating and releasing particulate and dissolved organic matter to the coastal food webs, i.e., they support a large fraction of the secondary production of the benthos. The present chapter is a review of the knowledge on seaweed biomass and production in the coastal Antarctic ecosystem opening a discussion on the role of these organisms as main energy sources in, e.g., small fjords and glacier-influenced sites, impacted by recent climatic change.

It is urgent to protect the marine ecology. In other words, to actively develop energy-saving and emission reduction technologies for marine diesel engines is in line with the long-term development needs of marine undertakings.For diesel engines that play a key role in ship driving, effective energy saving and emission reduction technologies are proposed from the aspects of improving the fuel combustion process, using alternative fuels, emission control and exhaust gas treatment, and comprehensive energy utilization, in order to truly realize the expected Provide reference for energy saving and emission reduction targets.

A discussion covers the production of methane from gas hydrate deposit in East Sea with industrial flue gases from steel company, refineries, and other sources; in-situ NMR measurement on methane in hydrate cages; evaluating the replacement ratio of methane hydrate at corresponding flue gas concentration; observation that more CO2 in vapor phase induce more CO2 in hydrate phase, indicating that CO2 might have more capability of replacing methane in hydrate cages than N2; establishing CO2 capture and sequestration into methane hydrate deposits in East Sea of Korea; and high purity of CO2 gas, which should be favorable to sequestration and recovery of methane from hydrate reservoir.

PY  - 2018
VL  - 24

AB  - The physical controlling factors on coastal plant communities are among the most dynamic of known ecosystems, but climate change alters coastal surface and subsurface hydrologic regimes, which makes rapid measurement of greenhouse gas fluxes critical. Greenhouse gas exchange rates in these terrestrial-aquatic ecosystems are highly variable worldwide with climate, soil type, plant community, and weather. Therefore, increasing data collection and availability should be a priority. Here, we demonstrate and validate physical and analytical modifications to automated soil-flux chamber measurement methods for unattended use in tidally driven wetlands, allowing the high-frequency capture of storm surge and day/night dynamics. Winter CO2 flux from Sarcocornia perennis marsh to the atmosphere was significantly greater during the day (2.8 mmol m(-2) hr(-1)) than the night (2.2 mmol m(-2) hr(-1); p < 0.001), while CH4 was significantly greater during the night (0.16 mu mol m(-2) hr(-1)) than the day (-0.13 mu mol m(-2) hr(-1); p = 0.04). The magnitude of CO2 flux during the day and the frequency of CH4 flux were reduced during a surge (p < 0.001). Surge did not significantly affect N2O flux, which without non-detects was normally distributed around -24.2 nmol m(-2) hr(-1). Analysis with sustained-flux global potentials and increased storm surge frequency scenarios, 2020 to 2100, suggested that the marsh in winter remains an atmospheric CO2 source. The modeled results showed an increased flux of CO2 to the atmosphere, while in soil, the uptake of CH4 increased and N2O uptake decreased. We present analytical routines to correctly capture gas flux curves in dynamic overland flooding conditions and to flag data that are below detection limits or from unobserved chamber-malfunction situations. Storm surge is an important phenomenon globally, but event-driven, episodic factors can be poorly estimated by infrequent sampling. Wider deployment of this system would permit inclusion of surge events in greenhouse gas estimates.

JO  - Energy Conversion And Management
PY  - 2016
VL  - 124
IS  - NA
AB  - In a world with increased pressure on reducing fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions, the cruise industry is growing in size and impact. In this context, further effort is required for improving the energy efficiency of cruise ship energy systems. In this paper, we propose a generic method for modelling the power plant of an isolated system with mechanical, electric and thermal power demands and for the optimal load allocation of the different components that are able to fulfil the demand. The optimisation problem is presented in the form of a mixed integer linear programming (MINLP) problem, where the number of engines and/or boilers running is represented by the integer variables, while their respective load is represented by the non-integer variables. The individual components are modelled using a combination of first-principle models and polynomial regressions, thus making the system nonlinear. The proposed method is applied to the load-allocation problem of a cruise ship sailing in the Baltic Sea, and used to compare the existing power plant with a hybrid propulsion plant. The results show the benefits brought by using the proposing method, which allow estimating the performance of the hybrid system (for which the load allocation is a non-trivial problem) while also including the contribution of the heat demand. This allows showing that, based on a reference round voyage, up to 3% savings could be achieved by installing the proposed system, compared to the existing one, and that a NPV of 11Â kUSD could be achieved already 5Â years after the installation of the system.

The role of geomechanics is to assess the mechanical impact of stress changes on seals, wells and faults. Since many hydrocarbon fields are geometrically complex and irregular, and the rock properties are spatially variable, such an assessment can be conveniently done with a numerical modeling of the field. Based on numerical analyses, recommendations can be given regarding the overall suitability of the depleted geological reservoir for CO2 disposal and safe CO2 injection.

JO  - Sustainability
PY  - 2022
VL  - 14
IS  - 16
AB  - Iron limitation in vast water bodies has been linked to decreased algal productivity, despite different iron-acquiring mechanisms, and the presence of ferritin in many algal species that act as an iron internal reservoir. Therefore, iron fertilization has been proposed to increase algal biomass and photosynthesis. This, in turn, will reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and increase oxygen, thereby decreasing global warming, and achieving ecological balance. In addition, algal proliferation will hopefully lead to enhancement in biodiversity, Biological pump, fish productivity and, subsequently marine food industry. Many climate geoengineering experiments in the form of ocean iron fertilization have been conducted globally in order to achieve such a purpose. However, reservations remain as the outcomes are not as promising as were previously expected. As the temporal and spatial scales of iron fertilization experiments are limited, the effects on fish productivity remain speculative. On the other hand, side effects were also recorded. The main purpose of iron fertilization, for carbon dioxide sequestration and global warming mitigation, still remains to be fully realized and verified. Several improvements and future modifications are suggested, and legal issues are discussed in this review.

AB  - Industrial revolution has led to increased combustion of fossil fuels. Consequently, large amounts of CO2 are emitted to the atmosphere, throwing the carbon cycle out of balance. Currently, the most effective method to reduce the CO2 concentration is direct CO2 capture from the atmosphere and pumping of the captured CO2 deep underground or into the mid-ocean. The transformation of CO2 into high-value chemicals is an attractive yet challenging task. In recent years, there has been much interest in the development of CO2 utilization technologies based on electrochemical CO2 reduction, photochemical CO2 reduction, and thermal CO2 reduction, and CO2 valorization has emerged as a hot research topic. In electrochemical CO2 reduction, the cathodic reaction is the reduction of CO2 to value-added chemicals. The anodic reaction should be the oxygen evolution reaction, and water is the only renewable and scalable source of electrons and protons in this reaction. There is a plethora of research on the use of various metals to catalyze this reaction. Among these, Cu-based materials have been demonstrated to show unique catalytic activity and stability for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to valuable fuels and chemicals. Moreover, the solar-driven conversion of CO2 into value-added chemical fuels has attracted great attention, and much effort is being devoted to develop novel catalysts for the photoreduction of CO2, especially by mimicking the natural photosynthetic process. The key step in the photocatalytic process is the efficient generation of electron-hole pairs and separation of these charge carriers. The efficient separation of photoinduced charge carriers plays a crucial role in the final catalytic activity. Compared with CO2 reduction via electrocatalysis and photocatalysis, thermal reduction is more attractive because of its potential large-scale application in the industry. Heterogeneous nanomaterials show excellent activity in the electrocatalytic, photocatalytic, and thermal catalytic conversion of CO2. However, nanostructured materials have drawbacks on the investigation of the intrinsic activity of the active sites. In recent years, single-site catalysts have become popular because they allow for maximum utilization of the metal centers, show specific catalytic performance, and facilitate easy elucidation of the catalytic mechanism at the molecular level. Accordingly, numerous single-site catalysts were developed for CO2 reduction to produce value-added chemicals such as CO, CH4, CH3OH, formate, and C2+ products. Value-added chemicals have also been synthesized with the aid of amines and epoxides. This review summarizes recent state-of-the-art single-site catalysts and their application as heterogeneous catalysts for the electroreduction, photoreduction, and thermal reduction of CO2. In the discussion, we will highlight the structure-activity relationships for the catalytic conversion of CO2 with single-site catalysts.

AB  - CO2 produced by carbon capture processes is generally not pure and can contain impurities such as N2, H2, CO, H 2S and water. The presence of these impurities could lead to challenging flow assurance issues. The presence of water may result in ice and/or gas hydrate formation and cause blockage. Reducing the water content is commonly required to reduce the potential for corrosion but for an offshore pipeline system it is also used as a means of preventing gas hydrate problems; however, there is little information on the dehydration requirements. Furthermore, the gaseous CO2 rich stream is generally compressed to be transported as liquid or dense-phase in order to avoid two-phase flow and increase the density of the system. The presence of the above impurities will also change the system's bubble point pressure, hence affecting the compression requirement. The aim of this communication is to evaluate the risk of hydrate formation in a rich carbon dioxide stream and to study the phase behaviour of CO2 in the presence of common impurities. An experimental methodology was developed for measuring water content in CO2 rich phase in equilibrium with hydrates. The water content in equilibrium with hydrates at simulated pipeline conditions (e.g., 4 Â°C up to 190 bar) as well as after simulated choke conditions (e.g., at -2 Â°C and around 50 bar) were measured for pure CO2 and a mixture of 2 mole% H2 and 98 mole% CO2. Bubble point measurements were also carried out for this binary mixture for temperatures ranging from -20 Â°C to 25 Â°C. A thermodynamic approach was employed to model the phase equilibria. The experimental data available in the literature on gas solubility in water in binary systems were used in tuning the BIPs. The thermodynamic model was used to predict the phase behaviour and the hydrate dissociation conditions of various CO2 rich streams in the presence of free water and various levels of dehydration (250 ppm and 500 ppm). The results are in good agreement with the available experimental data. The developed experimental methodology and thermodynamic model could provide the necessary data in determining the required dehydration level for CO2 rich systems, as well as minimum pipeline pressure required to avoid two phase flow, hydrates, and water condensation.

AB  - The ship's LNG power system is a key part to ensure the normal operation of the ship. Every key part of the ship will be commanded by the LNG power system. In the part that this article focuses on, the main components of the marine engine LNG power technology are the LNG power ignition system, electronic fuel injection system and idle speed control system. The working principle of marine engine LNG power technology first controls the commands issued by the control system through internal sensors, converts the commands into electrical signals through the command input device and transmits them to various electronic control units. Then the control unit processes the signals and finally the actuator Turn each command from the LNG power unit into a specific control operation for the ship. LNG power technology has a huge impact on the entire shipbuilding industry, improving the performance and kinetic energy of ship engines, reducing ship energy consumption, reducing exhaust gas emissions and reducing pollution.

VL  - 19

AB  - The slider crank is a proven mechanical linkage system with a long history of successful applications, and the slider-crank ocean wave energy converter (WEC) is a type of WEC that converts linear motion into rotation. This paper presents a control algorithm for a slider-crank WEC. In this study, a time-domain hydrodynamic analysis is adopted, and an AC synchronous machine is used in the power take-off system to achieve relatively high system performance. Also, a rule-based phase control strategy is applied to maximize energy extraction, making the system suitable for not only regular sinusoidal waves but also irregular waves. Simulations are carried out under regular sinusoidal wave and synthetically produced irregular wave conditions; performance validations are also presented with high-precision, real ocean wave surface elevation data. The influences of significant wave height, and peak period upon energy extraction of the system are studied. Energy extraction results using the proposed method are compared to those of the passive loading and complex conjugate control strategies; results show that the level of energy extraction is between those of the passive loading and complex conjugate control strategies, and the suboptimal nature of this control strategy is verified.

TI  - A self-regulating heat pump to utilize wind and wave energy sources
JO  - Energy Sources
PY  - 1990
VL  - 12
IS  - 1
AB  - Wind and wave energy devices produce their outpw in the form of shafr work, with a power ourput which varies over a wide range as the input energy intensity changes. For mypr ocesses (desalination, thermochemical processes, steam raising, space heating) energy is required in the form of heat. The conversion of shfi work directly to heat is thermodynamically very ineficient. This eficiency may be greatly improved by using the shafr work to drive a heat pump which abstracts thermal energy from the environment (the sea or airstream) and upgrades it to the requisite remperature level. In this regard, wind and wave energy are iakal sources, since the thermal energy contained in the airstream or sea exceeds by several orders of magnitude the mechanical energy that can be abstracted. Heatpwnps have hitherto been designed to utilize a constant work input and a source of heat at variable temperature. But in order to harness renewable energy effectively, a heat pump is required rhat will utilize variable shafr work to upgrade heal from a source at mar-conrtant temperamre. A prototype heat pump is described that enables heat from an ambient source at âˆ¼20Â°C to be delivered to a load at âˆ¼100Â°C by a vapor compression system working with variable power input, such as that deriving from wind or wave energy. The design incorporates features that enable power inputs from 0.3-3 kW to be harnessed, corresponding to the wave energy in a0.1-m width of usable wavefront, or the wind energy abstracted by a rotor of 2.5-m diameter in windspeeds of 7-15 m/s. A c.o.p. of âˆ¼3 may be obtained over this range of power input. Thus the heat output is equivalent to that obtainable directly from an energy conversion device of three times the size. The combination of a renewable energy device with a self-regulating heat pump exhibits significant economies of scale up to a unit size of around 1 MW (thermal). Thus the potential uses for this device, particularly in offshore processing and in desalination, are very great. Â© 1990 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A report synthesizes presentations on carbon dioxide made at the Annual American Association of Petroleum Geologists Conference (Dallas 4/18-21/2004). There were over 800 presentations and over 250 exhibitors. The emphasis on carbon dioxide related to how it is to be stored in Norway, USA, Canada, Australia, and France. In Norway, the first industrial scale use of trapping carbon dioxide has been underway since 1996 in the Sleipner offshore field in the North Sea where 1 million ton of carbon dioxide are captured and injected into a saline aquifer (Utsira). About a dozen sequestration projects in the USA are discussed. In Texas, 274 power plants produce 200 million ton of carbon dioxide or 55% of the total emitted in the state. Three aquifer sites at depths of 4500 ft have been identified for the power plants of Gibbons Creek, Sam K. Seymour, and Martin Lake that emit 3.5, 12.2, and 18.4 million ton of carbon dioxide. Several states (Indiana, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, and Ohio) have created the MIDCARD (Midcontinent Interactive Digital Carbon Atlas and Regional Database) consortium that has built the Relation Database Management System and GIS to itemize the main sources of carbon dioxide and possibilities of geologic sequestration on their territory. In Kentucky, marls seem to offer an initial possibility for sequestration but they are not yet tested. In Kansas, a project brings together co-generation, ethanol production, and assisted oil recovery with carbon dioxide. In another project carbon dioxide is sent to coal layers where methane is freed and carbon dioxide accumulates. Another project involves capture of carbon dioxide by lime. The Teapot Dome in Wyoming has been chosen for a sequestration test. In Alabama, samples have been analyzed in the Black Warrior basin to determine absorption isotherms of carbon dioxide and methane. In tho state of Washington, the mineralization of carbon dioxide is obtained in basalt formations. A map of methane gas fields absorbed in coal has been drawn for the USA in active and abandoned mines. The physics of coal and interactions between carbon dioxide and methane are under study. In Nova Scotia the levels of coal indicate the possibility to sequester carbon dioxide with the extraction of methane. In Australia, site research is ongoing with the GEODISC program. In France, IFP studies the evolution of carbon dioxide injected into aquifers or fields depleted of hydrocarbons.

TI  - Electric Power Integration Schemes of the Hybrid Fuel Cells and Batteries-Fed Marine Vessels-An Overview
JO  - Ieee Transactions On Transportation Electrification
PY  - 2022
VL  - 8
IS  - 2
AB  - Transportation electrification is undergoing a significant transition toward the utilization of efficient and reliable energy sources and smart integration schemes, where this transitioning is continuously facing ever-tightening challenges in order to comply with the increased environmental regulations. Among the different means of transportation, global maritime transport is responsible for 2\%-3\% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and it is predicted to increase to 17\% by 2050 if no changes are adapted. Hence, the international maritime organization (IMO) has targeted to reach a 50\% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050 compared to 2008. Hence, alternative energy sources shall be utilized in order to meet these strict GHG emissions reduction targets, where battery- and hydrogen-fed fuel cells can play a vital role in such aspects. Since the output of these two energy sources is unregulated dc voltage, their connection to the whole ship power system can be accomplished in several ways, where each way has its features, in addition to utilizing different power conditioning stages (PCSs), and these features are not well clarified and compared in the literature. Hence, this article presents an overview of the possible integration schemes that can be utilized in fuel cell- and battery-fed vessels, which is supported with a comparative assessment. This is also presented along with highlighting the state-of-the-art PCSs that are available in the market and can be utilized in these integration schemes within marine vessels. Such overview and comparative assessment are seen to be of significant importance and added value for researchers and developers in both the academic and industrial sides in order to accelerate the adoption of fuel cells in marine systems for zero-emission shipping.

JO  - Desalination
PY  - 2022
VL  - 539
IS  - NA
AB  - The conversion of biowaste into valuable carbon-based materials is beneficial for developing a sustainable energy economy. In this study, activated carbons (ACs) are successfully synthesized via one-step carbonization using Enteromorpha prolifera (EP) as the precursor, which is a kind of ocean biowaste causing green tides. Owing to EP's ordered anatomic texture and naturally embedded alkalis, the produced EP-derived ACs (EPACs) exhibit hierarchical porous structure without any support from active agents. Plentiful heteroatoms are also formed on surface of EPACs, endowing the carbon with good hydrophilicity and unique electronegativity. Consequently, the salt adsorption capacity and the charge efficiency of the capacitive deionization (CDI) system are improved by 12.1 \% and 11.95 \% respectively by replacing the commercial-AC cathode with the EPAC-800 cathode (pyro-lyzed at 800 degrees C). The potential distribution test and the modified Donnan model simulation suggest that the hierarchical pore volume of EPAC-800 offers great desalination capacity, while its surface electronegativity optimizes the potential distribution of the two electrodes. The new knowledge gained from this work will hopefully not only establish a scalable method to utilize the EP waste, but also guide the design and manufacture of high-performance electrodes for CDI technology.

The hydrodynamic and pneumatic response of the device were monitored for a two year period. A turbine generator rated at 75kW was installed in March 1991. Since then, the behaviour of the turbine generator has been monitored in all types of sea conditions. This paper gives a brief outline of the design and operation of the current system. Results from the electrical monitoring programme to date are presented. These focus on the performance of the turbine and generator in different sea conditions. The aerodynamic behaviour of the turbine is discussed with reference to the need for a well matched system. The energy transfer along the chain of power conversion from incident wave energy to electrical output will be evaluated. Comment will be made on the variability of the incident energy, and the resulting effect on the electrical output.

AB  - Aquaculture farming faces challenges to increase production while maintaining welfare of livestock, efficiently use of resources, and being environmentally sustainable. To help overcome these challenges, remote and real-time monitoring of the environmental and biological conditions of the aquaculture site is highly important. Multiple remote monitoring solutions for investigating the growth of seaweed are available, but no integrated solution that monitors different biotic and abiotic factors exists. A new integrated multi-sensing system would reduce the cost and time required to deploy the system and provide useful information on the dynamic forces affecting the plants and the associated biomass of the harvest. In this work, we present the development of a novel miniature low-power NFC-enabled data acquisition system to monitor seaweed growth parameters in an aquaculture context. It logs temperature, light intensity, depth, and motion, and these data can be transmitted or downloaded to enable informed decision making for the seaweed farmers. The device is fully customisable and designed to be attached to seaweed or associated mooring lines. The developed system was characterised in laboratory settings to validate and calibrate the embedded sensors. It performs comparably to commercial environmental sensors, enabling the use of the device to be deployed in commercial and research settings.

JO  - Atmospheric Environment
PY  - 2008
VL  - 42
IS  - 4
AB  - Air quality policy has focussed on land-based emissions for decades. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that emissions from sea-going vessels can no longer be ignored. There is a growing need for detailed emission inventories to evaluate the impact of this transport mode on air quality and health. In this paper we present MOPSEA, an activity-based emission model to determine emissions from sea-going vessels. The model considers shipping activities of sea-going vessels on Belgian territory, combined with individual vessel characteristics. We apply this model to study the effects of recent international efforts to reduce emissions from sea-going vessels in Belgian territorial waters for the current fleet and for two scenarios up to 2010. The emission model for Belgium, based on different vessel operating areas, reveals that most maritime emissions from the main engines will increase. CO2 emissions will increase by 2-9% over the 2004-2010 period due to an increase in shipping activity. NOX emissions are projected to rise between 1% and 8% because the increase in activity offsets the reductions from the international maritime organisation (IMO) and European regulations. In contrast, SO2 emissions will decrease by at least 50% in 6 years time. The switch of auxiliaries from heavy fuel oil to diesel oil at berth results in a large emission reduction (33%) for PM and small reductions for CO2, NOX, CO and HC (4-5%). The choice between a bottom-up versus top-down approach can have important implications for the allocation of maritime emissions. The MOPSEA bottom-up model allocates only 0.7 Mton CO2 to Belgium, compared to 24.2 Mton CO2 based on bunker fuel inventories. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Appropriate navigation strategies should be developed to overcome the current shipping industrial challenges under emission-control-based energy efficiency measures. Effective navigation strategies should be based on accurate ship performance and navigation information; therefore, various onboard data handling systems are installed on ships to collect large-scale datasets. Ship performance and navigation data that are collected to develop such navigation strategies can be an integrated part of the ship energy efficiency management plan (SEEMP). Hence, the SEEMP with various navigation strategies can play an important part of e-navigation under modern integrated bridge systems. This study proposes a machine-intelligence-based data handling framework for ship performance and navigation data to improve the quality of the respective navigation strategies. The prosed framework is divided into two main sections of pre and post processing. The data pre-processing is an onboard application that consists of sensor faults detection, data classification, and data compression steps. The data post processing is a shore-based application (i.e., in data centers) and that consists of data expansion, integrity verification, and data regression steps. Finally, a ship performance and navigation dataset of a selected vessel is analyzed through the proposed framework and successful results are presented in this study.

JO  - Green Chemistry
PY  - 2020
VL  - 22
IS  - 19
AB  - Within the current global climate, precedence has been set on achieving greater sustainable development within process industries. The ammonia process (BAU case) has been labelled as a significant greenhouse gas (GHG) producer-mainly due to high energy demand and CO2 emissions. This places the process under substantial scrutiny in terms of its climate change impacts and thus, provides a strong case study for viable transition towards greater sustainable operations. Here we examine, for the first time, sustainable eco-park designs for the diversification of the ammonia industry utilizing industrial symbiosis. The network considers several carbon capture and utilization (CCU) applications as well as ammonia (NH3) integration to produce the following downstream products: NH3, urea, Urea Ammonium Nitrate (UAN), Melamine (Mel) and Methanol (MeOH). Our results demonstrate improved energy efficiency with the inclusion of MeOH while UAN decreases net energy demand. Economically, the incorporation of MeOH gave attractive returns on investment due to increased productivity. Insights into environmental sustainability, through the assessment of Planetary Boundaries (PBs), revealed high risk operations aligned to climate change and ocean acidification earth systems linked to BAU operations. These impacts improved considerably with the addition of MeOH, resulting in safe operations of the ammonia process, attributed to increased waste recovery. These results were further supported using Life Cycle Sustainability Assessments, highlighting the potential of the BAU + urea + UAN + Mel + MeOH eco-park design for enhanced sustainable development. Overall, the findings of our paper suggest that upcoming and existing ammonia facilities can exploit industrial symbiosis to achieve greater sustainability through diversification of process operations.

AB  - The feasibility study of an integrated COmbined Gas Electric and Steam-reciprocating engine propulsion plant for a Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) fueled cruise-ferry is assessed in this paper. Specifically, the purpose of this work is to respond to GNV shipownersâ€™ need to equip ships with a propulsion system highly efficient in a wide ship speed range. The issue was addressed through the repowering study of the GNV La Suprema ship. Several power plant configurations based on different dual-fuel (DF) engine and gas turbine combinations have been tested in a cogeneration efficiency maximization study performed over a wide ship speed range. Afterwards, the best power plant was identified. Analysis showed that COmbined Gas Electric and Steam (COGES) plants have a great potential for marine propulsion application due to their benefits in cogeneration efficiency, emissions and required volumes. Furthermore, integrating a COmbined Gas Electric and Steam plant with small size dual-fuel engines revealed high cogeneration efficiency over wide ship operating conditions. The propulsion plant comprising a COmbined Gas Electric and Steam plant based on GE25.1 gas turbine and small size dual-fuel engines was proved to guarantee high cogeneration efficiency (47â€“52%) over a wide ship speed range (16â€“26 knots). In particular, a 51% cogeneration efficiency is provided for the current operating condition of GNV La Suprema. Moreover, the energy efficiency design index (EEDI) for the different investigated plants has been also evaluated, to verify their compliance with IMO limits. The selected propulsion plant provides an EEDI margin of 1.42â€“2.89 gCO2/(t*nm) with respect to the 2025 requirements. Finally, economic analysis was performed for four different ship routes and capital/operational costs have been computed. Overall, the proposed COmbined Gas Electric and Steam-reciprocating engine power plant revealed to be economically feasible over all of the operating conditions accounted for. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

The considered problem can be formulated as a non-linear program. We derive the intrinsic properties of the problem and develop an optimal algorithm based on the properties. Computational experiments show that the developed algorithm in this paper is efficient in finding an optimal solution.

AB  - Seawater and brackish water desalination provides a viable alternative to clean water supply for regions lacking fresh water sources or facing severe droughts. Current desalination technologies, however, are energy-expensive and environmentally unfriendly. Mimicking the natural transpiration process of mangrove trees that are able to survive in high-salinity environment, an artificial tree is conceived as a next-generation desalination system that can be entirely solar-powered and potentially achieve zero-liquid discharge and resource recovery. The artificial tree will float on saline water and be composed of synthetic roots that uptake and pretreat feed water, a synthetic trunk that lifts water up via capillary action through its microporous xylem, and synthetic leaves that efficiently convert sunlight to localized heat for water evaporation through their pores. Water vapor is condensed for clean water production while salt is collected for resource recovery or proper disposal. Science and technologies available and needed for realizing the artificial tree system are critically reviewed.

AB  - As the penetration of wind generation increases, the frequency support from wind turbines is necessary. There are many advantages for the connection between offshore wind farms and electricity grid via a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) system. HVDC transmission systems help wind farms provide frequency regulation and voltage control, which have more flexibility compared to HVAC transmission systems. Several control methods for frequency support have been developed. However, few works compared various control methods for a HVDC-connected offshore wind farm.This work proposes a detailed comparison on the main frequency-support control methods for the HVDC-connected offshore wind farm. These controls are mainly based on the communication-based schemes and the coordinated-based methods. The communication-based scheme uses communication devices to transfer the information of grid frequency to an offshore wind farm directly. The coordinated-based methods transfer the dynamic information of the DC voltage on HVDC via generator emulation control (GEC), and then enable the voltage source converter (VSC) at the wind-farm side to supply frequency regulation. In this work, the synthetic inertial control of wind turbines is considered, which include inertia and droop controllers; furthermore, the capacitors of the HVDC system can release the stored energy to help wind farms for the frequency-regulation function.

AB  - The technology of ocean Wave Energy Converters (WEC) has dramatically developed during recent years. These WECs apply various power take-off (PTO) system which are continuing to improve. Different types of PTOs such as hydroelectric, electromagnetic and air turbine systems have been introduced in different relevant studies. The most significant challenge in ocean WECs is related to different power take-off systems. This work introduces a new development of a WEC from a concept of taking energy from ocean waves to the prototype stage and testing along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. The point absorber Single-body WEC, which is a popular design, was selected to model the proposed system under different conditions, including irregular and regular waves. The bi-directional motion of a wave is converted to the unidirectional motion which rotates the generator by the proposed PTO system that named 'Mechanical Gear Rectifier' (MGR), in which a new pinion system is applied. A prototype of our small-scale WEC was designed, built, and then a close analysis of it is performed. Finally, the performance of proposed WEC carefully tested in different wave conditions (regular and irregular waves). The simulation results demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed MGR-WEC.

AB  - The demand for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) in the global markets has changed significantly. As a result, industries have been forced to consider investing significantly in supply chains to achieve an efficient distribution of LNG for cost efficiency and carbon footprint reduction. To minimize the contribution of LNG maritime transportation to global climate change, there is a need to quantify the carbon footprints systematically. In this research, we developed a novel and practical model for estimating the carbon footprint for LNG maritime transport. Using the MATLAB program, an uncertainty-based carbon footprint accounting framework is created. The Monte Carlo simulation model is built to conduct a carbon footprint analysis while the main input parameters were changed within a reliable range. Later, a multivariate sensitivity analysis is performed using the Risk Solver software to estimate the most significant parameters on the net carbon footprints. The sensitivity analysis results showed that that steam process day and steaming fuel consumption are found to be the most sensitive parameters for the overall carbon footprint for both Laden and Ballast trips. Furthermore, it was found that the Q-Max vessel produces more carbon emissions when compared to the Q-Flex, although both are traveling the same distance and are using the same fuel type. The type of fuel is also significantly affecting the emission values due to the relevant carbon content in the fuel. Like the case of the two conventional vessels, the one that is running with the only LNG is found to have fewer emissions when compared to the one run with dual-mode. Â© 2021

AB  - Test results of aircraft detection and tracking over large offshore wind farms show that a track can be maintained on a light manoeuvring aircraft as well as general aviation aircraft using an off-the-shelf radar solution. The optimum strategy of mitigating the deteriorating effects of closely spaced wind turbines on air surveillance is shown to depend on the characteristics of the wind farm, in particular the density of the wind turbines.
