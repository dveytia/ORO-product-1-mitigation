AB  - Simple Summary Seafloor biodiversity provides a key ecosystem service, as an efficient route for carbon to be removed from the atmosphere to become buried (long-term) in marine sediment. Protecting near intact ecosystems, particularly those that are hotspots of biodiversity, with high numbers of unique species (endemics), is increasingly being recognised as the best route to protect existing blue carbon. This study measured globally significant stocks of blue carbon held within both rocky (17.5 tonnes carbon km(-2)) and soft (4.1 t C km(-2)) substrata shallow (20 m) seafloor communities along the Antarctic Peninsula. Along the 7998 km of seasonally ice-free shoreline, 59\% of known dive sites were classified as rocky and 12\% as soft substratum. This gave estimates of 253k t C in animals and plants found at 20 m depth, with a potential sequestration of 4.5k t C year(-1). More carbon was stored in assemblages with greater functional groups. Of the Antarctic Peninsula shore, 54\% is still permanently ice covered, and so blue carbon ecosystem services are expected to more than double with continued climate warming. As one of the few increasing negative feedbacks against climate change, protecting seafloor communities around the Antarctic is expected to help tackle both the biodiversity and climate crises. The importance of cold-water blue carbon as biological carbon pumps that sequester carbon into ocean sediments is now being realised. Most polar blue carbon research to date has focussed on deep water, yet the highest productivity is in the shallows. This study measured the functional biodiversity and carbon standing stock accumulated by shallow-water (<25 m) benthic assemblages on both hard and soft substrata on the Antarctic Peninsula (WAP, 67 degrees S). Soft substrata benthic assemblages (391 +/- 499 t C km(-2)) contained 60\% less carbon than hard substrata benthic assemblages (648 +/- 909). In situ observations of substrata by SCUBA divers provided estimates of 59\% hard (4700 km) and 12\% soft (960 km) substrata on seasonally ice-free shores of the Antarctic Peninsula, giving an estimate of 253,000 t C at 20 m depth, with a sequestration potential of \~{}4500 t C year(-1). Currently, 54\% of the shoreline is permanently ice covered and so climate-mediated ice loss along the Peninsula is predicted to more than double this carbon sink. The steep fjordic shorelines make these assemblages a globally important pathway to sequestration, acting as one of the few negative (mitigating) feedbacks to climate change. The proposed WAP marine protected area could safeguard this ecosystem service, helping to tackle the climate and biodiversity crises.

VL  - 2
IS  - NA
AB  - Scheduled international environmental regulations are resulting in an increasing interest to use Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) as fuel for ships. However, the well known potential of LNG to reduce emissions must not increase the potential risks compared to conventional fuels. The Maritime Safety Committee has published an Interim Guidelines MSC.285(86) which includes a collision safety rule for gas fuelled vessels which requests a minimal distance of the LNG storage tanks from the ship outer shell (B/5-Rule). However, research work is needed regarding the actual crashworthiness of alternative ship designs with an LNG tank position closer to the ship shell than the B/5-Rule. A minimum safety concept actually discussed requires that LNG fuelled vessels shall have a collision resistance at least similar to the one of LNG carriers. In the present paper a case study is presented where the collision resistance of a gas fuelled 6500 TEU Container Vessel is investigated based on the GL-Rules I-1-33. The Container Vessel has an alternative design to the B/5-Rule exploiting more cargo hold space for LNG bunckering by placing the LNG tanks at 8% of B from the side shell. The crashworthiness of the Container Vessel is compared to the one of an LNG tanker of approximately the same size. Numerical computations indicate that the critical collision speed up to penetration of the inner hull is larger for the LNG carrier. For the more relevant case of LNG spill the Container Vessel with alternative design has an increased crashworthiness compared to the LNG tanker. It is shown that the critical collision speed for the Container Vessel is almost twice the one of the LNG tanker in case of an LNG spill. Copyright Â© 2012 by ASME.

AB  - Hydrodynamic loading of solid bodies like ships or breakwaters can be simulated well using geometry resolving computational fluid dynamics methods, where the body shape is resolved in the mesh describing the domain. Slender bodies, like spars, multiple tidal turbine blades or lattice structures would often require prohibitively high cell counts, since the geometrical features to be resolve are much smaller than the overall domain. However, such bodies are usually made up of generic cross sections like round, square or standardised technical profiles like the famous NACA 4/5 digit series for which good parametrisations of reaction forces to incoming flow exist. Actuator line methods thus apply inflow dependent reaction forces to the fluid domain, allowing the computationally efficient simulation of slender bodies and have been used extensively, for example for wake assessments or tidal turbine array simulations. Slender bodies are also standard building blocks of structural simulations using the finite element method. Combining actuator line theory with a finite element beam model allows to efficiently simulate flexible structures, like tidal turbine blades or nettings used in fish farms. This paper presents an implementation of such a coupled model in OpenFOAM. The underlying numerical method is detailed and first example application and validation cases are provided.

TI  - Advantages and disadvantages from enforcing emission restrictions within emission control areas
JO  - Maritime Business Review
PY  - 2016
VL  - 1
IS  - 2
AB  - Purpose - Emissions produced by oceangoing vessels not only negatively affect the environment but also may deteriorate health of living organisms. Several regulations were released by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to alleviate negative externalities from maritime transportation. Certain polluted areas were designated as ``Emission Control Areas{''} (ECAs). However, IMO did not enforce any restrictions on the actual quantity of emissions that could be produced within ECAs. This paper aims to perform a comprehensive assessment of advantages and disadvantages from introducing restrictions on the emissions produced within ECAs. Two mixed-integer non-linear mathematical programs are presented to model the existing IMO regulations and an alternative policy, which along with the established IMO requirements also enforces restrictions on the quantity of emissions produced within ECAs. A set of linearization techniques are applied to linearize both models, which are further solved using the dynamic secant approximation procedure. Numerical experiments demonstrate that introduction of emission restrictions within ECAs can significantly reduce pollution levels but may incur increasing route service cost for the liner shipping company. Design/methodology/approach - Two mixed- integer non-linear mathematical programs are presented to model the existing IMO regulations and an alternative policy, which along with the established IMO requirements also enforces restrictions on the quantity of emissions produced within ECAs. A set of linearization techniques are applied to linearize both models, which are further solved using the dynamic secant approximation procedure. Findings - Numerical experiments were conducted for the French Asia Line 3 route, served by CMA CGM liner shipping company and passing through ECAs with sulfur oxide control. It was found that introduction of emission restrictions reduced the quantity of sulfur dioxide emissions produced by 40.4 per cent. In the meantime, emission restrictions required the liner shipping company to decrease the vessel sailing speed not only at voyage legs within ECAs but also at the adjacent voyage legs, which increased the total vessel turnaround time and in turn increased the total route service cost by 7.8 per cent. Research limitations/implications - This study does not capture uncertainty in liner shipping operations. Practical implications - The developed mathematical model can serve as an efficient practical tool for liner shipping companies in developing green vessel schedules, enhancing energy efficiency and improving environmental sustainability. Originality/value - Researchers and practitioners seek for new mathematical models and environmental policies that may alleviate pollution from oceangoing vessels and improve energy efficiency. This study proposes two novel mathematical models for the green vessel scheduling problem in a liner shipping route with ECAs. The first model is based on the existing IMO regulations, whereas the second one along with the established IMO requirements enforces emission restrictions within ECAs. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to assess advantages and disadvantages from introducing emission restrictions within ECAs.

AB  - Vast natural gas discoveries have been reported in recent years in the offshore sector of the Rovuma sedimentary basin, Mozambique. Subsequently the Mozambique Government approved a natural gas development plan contemplating, amongst other scenarios, the construction of natural gas processing plants in the Municipalities of Palma and Pemba. The work presented in this article is a preliminary assessment of the CO2 storage potential in the onshore Rovuma Basin, which for that purpose was subdivided into four sectors. Only the Palma - Mocimboa da Praia and Macomia - North Pemba sectors are conditions suitable for safe CO2 storage. In the Palma - Mocimboa da Praia sector, situated in the NE part of the Rovuma basin, where the potential reservoirs are the Alto Jingone/Quissanga Formation and the Mikindani Formation, the prospective storage capacity is estimated to range from 150 Mt to 300 Mt. In the Macomia - North Pemba sector, the reservoir consists of the lower units of the Pemba Formation, dating from the Upper Jurassic/Lower Cretaceous, with an estimated storage capacity varying from 85 Mt to 170 Mt. Mozambique seems to present an interesting case in favour of developing CCS projects under in the Clean Development Mechanism. This article aims to raise awareness between national authorities and research institutions about the relevance of initiating a detailed assessment of the CO2 storage in Mozambique, namely in the Rovuma basin.

TI  - The acquisition of inorganic carbon by the seagrass Zostera marina
JO  - Aquatic Botany
PY  - 1997
VL  - 56
IS  - 3-4
AB  - In this work, it is elucidated to what degree the seagrass Zostera marina L. can utilise HCO3/as an external inorganic-carbon source for photosynthesis, and which of two possible systems for its acquisition is in effect. It was found that HCO3/- was used as a major source of inorganic carbon at the normal seawater-pH of 8.2, and that bulk CO2 contributed only marginally (less than 20%) to photosynthesis at that pH. By comparing photosynthetic rates at pH 8.2 and 9.0, it was deduced that CO3/2- could not be utilised. It was further found that HCO3/- could be acquired via extracellular dehydration to CO2, as catalysed by external/surface-bound carbonic anhydrase, prior to inorganic-carbon uptake. Indications for active, ATPase-mediated, HCO3/- transport was also found, but an inhibitor of extracellular carbonic anhydrase affected photosynthetic rates more than did the less specific ATPase inhibitors. The rationale for HCO3/- dehydration versus its direct uptake is discussed with regard to the photosynthetic performance of seagrasses, many of which are inorganic-carbon limited in their natural habitats.

JO  - International Journal Of Greenhouse Gas Control
PY  - 2022
VL  - 118
IS  - NA
AB  - Continued research into reservoir characterization along with offshore carbon dioxide (CO2) transportation and infrastructure assets is needed to facilitate development of safe and successful carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) projects. This paper outlines a multi-criteria evaluation methodology that incorporates disparate sets of quantitative, spatially variable data into a decision-making framework for screening the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) outer continental shelf (OCS) for potentially viable CO2 storage and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) sites. Criteria categories include favorable geologic characteristics, logistics, and potential risks. Data compiled for 14 criteria from several publicly available geographic information system (GIS) layers was aggregated over 2559 spatially balanced points across the study area using the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL)-developed Cumulative Spatial Impact Layersâ„¢ (CSIL) GIS tool. Criteria are weighted by qualitative expert opinion relative to their perceived importance to given scenariosâ€” the output of combined criteria values and weights enables regional CO2 storage suitability differentiation. The methodology considers both technical and non-technical factors impacting CCUS decision-making. The flexible methodology enables a systematic approach to regional ranking at high spatial resolution over a large study domain. Additionally, the framework enables high-grading of priority sites that warrant further characterization and follow-on analysis. Areas along the Louisiana coast and Mississippi River Delta consistently rank high for all scenarios largely a result of the favorable geology with the potential for stacked storage, as well as the density of existing pipelines and platforms, and proximity to several onshore CO2 sources. High-graded regions for the CO2 EOR-related scenarios are typically located further offshore towards the middle and edge of the OCS compared to higher priority regions for the geologic storage scenarios which fall closer to the Louisiana coastline.

AB  - A hallmark of the maritime transportation industry is efficiency. Estimates are that 90% of cross border world trade is accomplished by means of waterways while consuming only 7% of the energy for the total transportation sector. Nonetheless, marine diesel engines, which serve as power plants for most commercial, ocean going vessels, have long been identified as a major source of air pollution for port cities and coastal areas. Accordingly, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (the MARPOL Treaty) has significant ramifications for the maritime industry, as exemplified by the stringent 2016 standard to lower emissions. Such realities, along with the rising cost of non-renewable petroleum fuels, necessitate the recovery of the wasted heat onboard marine vessels. Thermoelectric materials are an enabling technology that allows the recapture of this wasted energy from heat sources, such as exhaust and coolant systems, which account for nearly 50% of the total combustion energy. If a fraction of the marine diesel's wasted energy could be harnessed and stored with high power density batteries, an electric drive system could be utilized to transport ships quietly and cleanly into and out of congested ports and high population centers. Overall, a dramatic reduction of the maritime industry's carbon footprint could be realized, as a modest 10% increase in engine efficiency translates into a savings of approximately 180,000 barrels of fuel per day on a world-wide basis. Solid state thermoelectric materials, when exposed to a thermal gradient, generate an electric potential according to the Seebeck effect. While the automobile industry has taken a lead in commercializing thermoelectric generators (TEG) as early as 2013, it is the marine industry that may well be the greater beneficiary of this technology. Economies of scale, the ability to generate a higher thermal gradient, and fewer weight and volume constraints, all suggest a promising feasibility for marine applications. The successful development of a hybrid thermoelectric vessel (green ship) at Maine Maritime Academy is a promising first step in helping realize the theme of this year's General Assembly of the International Association of Maritime Universities (IAMU): Green Ships, Eco Shipping, and Clean Seas.

AB  - The concentration of CO2 in Earthâ€™s atmosphere has been gradually increasing since the Industrial Revolution, primarily as a result of the use of fossil fuels as energy sources. Although coal and oil have been vital to the development of modern civilization, it is now recognized that atmospheric CO2 levels must be reduced to avoid the serious effects of climate change, including natural disasters. Consequently, there is currently significant interest in developing suitable methods for the fixation of CO2 in the air and in exhaust gases. The present work demonstrates a simple yet innovative approach to the chemical fixation of extremely low and very high CO2 concentrations in air, such as might result from industrial sources. This process is based on the use of aqueous solutions of the water-soluble compounds NaOH and CaCl2, which react with CO2 to produce the harmless solids CaCO3 (limestone) and NaCl (salt) via intermediates such as NaHCO3 and Na2CO3. The NaCl generated in this process can be converted back to NaOH via electrolysis, during which H2 (which can be used as a clean energy source) and Cl2 are produced simultaneously. Additionally, sea water contains both NaCl and CaCl2 and so could provide a ready supply of these two compounds. This system provides a safe, inexpensive approach to simultaneous CO2 fixation and storage. Â© 2022, The Author(s). funding_textÂ 1={The author thanks Hiroyuki Okada, President of Shinko-Sangyo Co.

AB  - In todayâ€™s environment of increasing pressure to reduce fuel consumption and emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and nitrogen oxides (NOx ), the LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) transportation industry is growing in size and influence. In this context, further efforts are needed to improve the energy efficiency of LNG marine energy power plant. The LNG vessels and their equipment considered in this study have different power consumption requirements depending on the vesselâ€™s mode of operation (loading/unloading, maneuvering, anchoring, at sea, etc.). For each ship mode, where the power plant requirements are the same, the specific fuel consumption (SFOC) and exhaust emissions, NOx and CO2, are compared with a different number of engines in the network to find the optimal number of engines in the network, considering both the safety aspect and the port requirements. An analysis was performed showing the efficiency of the on-board power management system (PMS) in terms of manual load sharing between engines. A comprehensive analysis of the data and its comparison led to the conclusion that the manual distribution of power among the engines is the slightly better solution. The obtained results show that further analysis of the number of engines for a given load with minimum fuel consumption and CO2 and NOx emissions is required.

AB  - Contaminated freshwater, estuarine and marine sediments are a priority of national concern, due to impacts on ecosystems and marine resources, public health and economic development. Contaminants such as chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to be strongly sorbing and bioaccumulative, thus impacting ecosystem degradation, public health, and economic development. Hydrogen amendments in sediments contaminated with dioxins resulted in extensive dechlorination of Cl8DD to Cl1DD at the expense of a decrease in 2,3,7,8-Cl4DD production. In addition, dechlorination occurred at accelerated (200-fold) rates. An increase in hydrogen flux (dissolved hydrogen concentration) resulted in a statistically significant increase in percent active sediment-eluted microorganisms. Evidence from groundwater literature and our previous sediment research indicates a role for hydrogen as a driving force for dechlorination reactions. The purpose of this work is to determine the efficiency of a microbial enhancement technology through hydrogen amendments in sediments of varying geochemistry and contaminant history.

AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) announced that maritime transport share by 2.89% in global greenhouse gases. Electric propulsion system appears as a promising option for reducing ship emissions, especially for high-powered vessels. The aim of the current paper is to investigate the environmental and economic impact of using electric propulsion systems. Simple eco-environmental model was presented to assess the best propulsion system for passenger ships. A comparison between diesel electric (DE) and combined gas turbine electric and steam (COGES) propulsion systems is conducted. As a case study, one of the cruise ships is selected. The results showed specific environmental benefits of COGES over DE propulsion option. From the design and operational viewpoints, COGES propulsion system is more energy efficient than DE by 9.3% and 27.55%, respectively. Economically, the values of the life cycle costs are 5,013 and 6,042 $/kW for DE and COGES systems, respectively. Finally, COGES seems as a greener option with a life-cycle cost-effectiveness of 612, 1970, and 6 $/ton for NOx, SOx, and CO2 emissions, respectively.

AB  - With the onset of a global pandemic, all the sectors have started to become heavily dependent on Information Technology to improve the standards and performance of their respective fields. Being of utmost importance to the day-to-day life of humans, shipping plays a major role in our everyday life. As it is the case with the other sectors shipping had become increasingly dependent on Information Technology. The use of satellite communication along with other sophisticated tools have improved the shipping sector with the latest technology improving the performance of ships and shipping as well. This study explores the possibilities of globally consistent connectivity and specialized analytics channels enabling shipping equipment vendors to sell add-on aftercare services such as remote real-time analytics of fuel use to aid compliance with emissions regulations. Web Companies assume that fibre-like connectivity should be as accessible at sea as it is in the home, so that shipping fleets, floating communities, and offshore operations can become more efficient, sustainable, and profitable. The main objective of this study is to investigate high throughput, low latency solutions enabling a digital transformation of operations at sea. Focusing on improving access to real time performance data, supporting environmental impact monitoring, improving the timeliness of tracking and crew scheduling in addition to enhancing customer experiences for cruise and yacht passengers, the capabilities enable user access to fast, flexible, secure connectivity as a standardized service. Beyond regulation, digital transformation enabled by reliable and flexible connectivity also promises to deliver major cost efficiencies to the maritime sector. Unlocking the capability for real-time data exchange between all equipment and ships in all locations, will empower crews to make management and optimisation decisions not only on their own vessel, but fleet-wide. These new and pending regulatory and non-regulatory drivers create a need for real-time collection and analysis of data in a secure and trustworthy format. Operators will need to find new ways to co-operate between ship and shore to transform fuel efficiency, which will require new technologies to ensure greater standardization, integration and communication of maritime data. Reliable, flexible connectivity will enable maritime shipping organizations to meet new challenges, but also get ahead by implementing their own transformative changes to benefit efficiency and profitability for years to come. Based at CINEC Sri Lanka, venturing into this Jetstream with expert solutions to cover a wide range of products and services throughout the life cycle of any vessel and technology - from 3D design and engineering to risk assessment and ship management this overall solution, based on Information Technology, will optimize the digitalization of the outlook of the global maritime industry.

AB  - To combat global warming, â€œcarbon neutralityâ€ has gradually become a consensus. Some countries have constructed domestic and regional carbon trading markets, and links to global carbon markets are receiving increasing attention. Blue carbon, an important component of nature-based solutions (NbS), has not received the attention it deserves and is still isolated from the carbon trading market. Based on summarizing the existing achievements of blockchain application in carbon trading, this paper analyzes how to make each participating body provide services in the process of blue carbon production, circulation and trading, and designs the architectural diagram of the blue carbon system under peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions based on the theoretical framework of blockchain 3.0. Utilizing the advantages of decentralization, high transparency and non-tamperability of blockchain, we can realize a highly efficient, low-cost and intelligent blue carbon trading management system. Thus, we can make the world pay more attention to the development and utilization of marine resources and increase investment in blue carbon sink projects; and promote the development of blue carbon market, enrich the carbon trading market, and help achieve â€œemission reduction without reduction in productionâ€.

AB  - Reducing fuel oil costs is one of the main items in the Short Sea Vessel market, just as in most areas of shipping. The best way to reduce fuel oil costs is to improve the energy efficiency of a ship and consequently reduce its fuel consumption. Conoship International developed a new hull form consisting of the ConoDuctTail and the ConoSeaBow as an energy efficient solution for Short Sea Vessels. Reduction of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions provides environmentally friendly and economical ships, among others expressed by their excellent Energy Efficient Design Index values. Further work to improve the econology of Conoship designed short sea vessels is focused on emission-reduction of the propulsion installation using LNG for propulsion fuel. Emissions of CO2, sulfur, NOx, and soot particles could be reduced by application of LNG, but the challenge is to create an economically feasible ship design, integrating the LNG-installation and LNG-tank in the most cost-efficient way.

AB  - The initial design of a 12-MW floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) was made by the University of Ulsan (UOU) based on the 5-MW offshore wind turbine of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) using the law of similarity. The tower design was checked through the eigenfrequency and fatigue strength analysis according to the GL guideline of tower design conditions. The direct expansion of the 5 MW wind turbine support structure caused a resonance problem of the tower of the 12-MW UOU FOWT and the tower length was adjusted to avoid the 3P resonance. Wind turbines are required to have a design life of more than 20 years and shall be designed to endure both ultimate and fatigue loads experienced during the design life. The platform pitch motion of FOWTs due to combined wave and wind loading may result severely in both fore-aft forces and moments at the base of the tower. In this study, we used the simplified fatigue analysis, which is generally applied when considering safety margins by stress to predict the fatigue life of tower. In order to calculate the fatigue load, the Markov matrix was constructed by using the cycle counting method to determine range, average value, and cycle number of loads from peak and valley values of actual load histories simulated by FAST v8 of the tower base. The predicted fatigue life at the tower base was follow by S/N curves for welded steel structures and it was calculated by the Palmgren-Miner's rule.

AB  - The shipping industry is currently navigating an era of unprecedented uncertainty, brought upon by the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the advancements in digital technologies and digitization, and the ever-increasing importance of the environmental performance. The shipping industry in its efforts to reduce its environmental footprint has targeted a 50% reduction of its GHG emissions by 2050, benchmarked to 2008 levels. In this respect, the development of marine type ammonia (NH3)-powered Fuel Cells (FCs) is a prominent solution, as liquid NH3 has very good safety (fire and explosion) and energy characteristics and its use as a marine fuel in FCs can result in efficient power generation with excellent environmental performance. Nonetheless, prior to its wider acceptance by the maritime community the NH3 related technologies must prove that they are at least as safe as the existing systems. This is addressed in the present research. In detail, this paper identifies the main hazards associated with NH3 FCs and subsequently examines their impact on the overall system to further gauge the risk. This methodology includes the novel combination of a systematic Hazard Identification (HAZID) process with a functional and modelbased approach for simulating the impact of various hazards.

AB  - Global climate change related to anthropogenic CO2 emissions is one of the most significant challenges for the future of human life on Earth. There are many potential options for reducing or even eliminating atmospheric CO2 emissions including underground sequestration, carbon mineralization and ocean storage. One of the most promising materials for carbon mineralization is Mg(OH)(2) which is highly reactive and capable of forming stable carbonates. Here we show a novel low-carbon method of producing Mg(OH)(2), from globally abundant olivine-rich silicate rocks. A combination of acid digestion and electrolysis of olivine were used to produce Mg(OH)(2) in a fully recoverable system. The use of Mg(OH)(2) from olivine provides a viable pathway for significant industrial scale reductions in global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Magnesium hydroxide is a sustainable material for CO2 sequestration, according to an acid digestion and electrolysis method using olivine-rich silicate rocks in a fully recoverable system.

AB  - Prices of crude oil are highly volatile. Across the globe, conventional power generation system is facing the problems of gradual depletion of fossil fuel resources, poor energy efficiency and environmental pollution. Global pressure is mounting to reduce green-house gases (GHC). As a part of Kyoto protocol political institutions from EU and UK have agreed to reduce substantially emissions of CO2 to help counter climate change by giving emphasis in the use of non-conventional/renewable energy sources like natural gas, biogas, wind power, solar photovoltaic cells, fuel cells, etc. The possible solution to use these renewables would be to integrate these renewable sources in local level to form local dc distribution system. This paper presents the idea of renewables based dc distribution, which meets the electrical demand of local residential and commercial entities. Higher distribution voltage is selected in-order to expand the grid to commercial level and to provide the possibility of direct connection of offshore wind turbines. Wind power is considered as major power source for the system due to its dominance in the renewable energy market. The detailed MATLAB simulation of 5 mw PMSG based WT with fully rated IGBT inverter is carried using suitable MPPT technique. The failure of controller due to saturation of the actuator is mitigated by employing suitable Anti-windup scheme. Simulation result shows good dynamic performance of the system. Â© 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Although environmental factors such as grain size and organic carbon content may influence the distribution of microbes in marine sediments, there has been little experimental study of the topic to date. To investigate how those sediment variables affect microbial colonisation under in situ conditions, deep-sea sediments and artificial sediments (glass beads, sands) were incubated in the Arctic deep sea at 2500 m water depth with or without chitin, one of the most important carbon polymers in marine environments. Microbial abundance, biomass, chitobiase activity and changes in community structure were monitored after 7 days and 1 year. In control sediments without chitin addition, no significant changes in microbial abundance, biomass and activity were observed after 1 year. In the presence of chitin, however, considerable increases in these parameters were recorded in all three sediment types tested. Regardless of chitin addition, natural deep-sea sediments were always associated with higher values of microbial abundance, biomass and activity compared with artificial sediments. Sediment type was always found to be the most significant factor explaining variation in enzymatic activity and bacterial community structure as compared to the effects of chitin amount, incubation time, and changes in cell number or biomass. Overall, this is the first in situ study that has addressed the effects of multiple factors and their interactions on abundance, biomass, activity and community structure of microbial communities in the deep Arctic Ocean.

JO  - Proceedings Of The International Conference On Offshore Mechanics And Arctic Engineering - Omae

VL  - 8
IS  - NA
AB  - The development of wave energy for utility-scale electricity production requires an understanding of how wave energy converters will interact with each other when part of a wave farm. Without this understanding it is difficult to calculate the energy yield from a wave farm and consequently the optimal wave farm layout and configuration cannot be determined. In addition, the uncertainty in a wave farm's energy yield will increase the cost of finance for the project, which ultimately increases the cost of energy. Numerical modelling of wave energy converter arrays, based on potential flow, has provided some initial indications of the strength of array interactions and optimal array configurations; however, there has been limited validation of these numerical models. Moreover, the cross-validation that has been completed has been for relatively small arrays of wave energy converters. To provide some validation for large array interactions wave basin testing of three different configurations of up to 24 wave energy converters has been completed. All tests used polychromatic (irregular) sea-states, with a range of long-crested and short-crested seas, to provide validation in realistic conditions. The physical model array interactions are compared to those predicted by a numerical model and the suitability of the numerical and physical models analysed. The results are analysed at three different levels and all provide support for the cross-validation of the two models. The differences between the physical and numerical model are also identified and the implications for improving the modelling discussed. Â© 2013 by ASME.

AB  - Oscillatory nature of the ocean waves lead to intermittent power generated by the wave energy converters (WECs). As a result, WECs face a major barrier for grid integration. The recently introduced undersea storage system (USS) offers a viable solution to overcome this barrier by smoothing the WEC output power fluctuations. Another, but related, issue is that since the output voltage of WECs are relatively at the low-voltage range and they are deployed far away from the coast, the internal grid in wave farm is required to collect the produced energy by all WECs and deliver it to a high-voltage grid via a voltage step-up equipment. In this paper, a modular multi-level converter (MMC)-based isolated dc/dc converter is proposed for voltage step-up at the collecting point and transferring the harvested power to a high-voltage dc (HVDC) line. Simulation studies of a grid-connected direct-drive WEC along with the USS are carried out. The considered WEC is interfaced with the MMC-based converter by an ac/dc converter. The USS is employed to regulate the dc-link voltage of the MMC converter and WEC output power fluctuations. The regulated dc power is transferred through an HVDC line and converted to ac on the onshore cite. Â© 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Oscillating Water Column (OWC) with its mechanism based on converting hydrodynamic energy into pneumatic energy is one of the earliest wave energy converters studied by researchers. While the focus of the previous studies were mainly on hydrodynamic efficiency, this paper addresses free surface fluctuation inside the OWC chamber emphasizing on sloshing phenomenon through irregular wave impingement. As reflection response of an offshore OWC plays an important role in energy conversion chain, this paper also provides an insight of wave reflection by such devices. The experimental results show that decreasing damping effect boosts the sloshing energy stored inside the OWC chamber but the ratio of sloshing energy content to the total stored energy inside the chamber decreases; accentuating the importance of tuning short period waves with larger slot sizes. In the context of reflection response of an OWC, relative depth (kd) is the most important factor which can make a great difference in reflection coefficients even up to 100\%. Spectral reflection analysis shows that regardless of incident wave height, slot size and draft value, there is a range of relative chamber length (l/L); 0.1 < l/L < 0.30, where spectral reflection coefficient is zero. The only parameter may change the range is incident wave period.

AB  - Recently, the efficiency of diesel-electric marine vessels has been subject for discussion with focus on improving fuel efficiency, reducing the environmental footprint from emissions, as well as reducing running hours and maintenance costs. This paper presents an analysis of load profiles extracted from three different vessels during operation: 1) a ferry; 2) a platform supply vessel; and 3) a seismic survey vessel. The analysis of the extracted data shows that the loadings of the diesel engines are typically quite low, and do not fall within the optimal loading range of diesel engines' specific fuel oil consumption curves. Furthermore, three different power plant configurations are proposed and compared, which include fixed-speed (diesel engine generators) and variable-speed gensets and the implementation of an energy storage system. Moreover, energy management system (EMS) algorithms based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) are proposed as a suitable strategy for optimal unit commitment in the power generation. The results yielded from the MILP algorithms are compared with those from the EMS algorithms based on logic such as if/ else statements. The results indicate that optimal EMS algorithms in combination with a revised vessel configuration can increase the operational efficiency, in terms of fuel savings and reduction in genset running hours.

AB  - This paper presents a study on reliability evaluation of a power system considering wind turbine generators (WTG) with multi-state. Renewable energy resources such as wind, wave, solar, micro hydro, tidal and biomass etc. are becoming importance stage by stage because of considering effect of the environment. Wind energy is one of the most successful sources of renewable energy for the production of electrical energy. But, reliability evaluation of generating system with wind energy resources is a complex process. While the wind turbine generators can not modelled as two-state model as like as conventional generators, they should be modelled as multi-state model due to wind speed random variation. The methodology for obtaining reliability evaluation index of wind turbine generators is different from it of the conventional generators. A method for making outage capacity probability table of WTG for reliability is proposed in this paper. The detail process is presented using case study of simple system.

AB  - LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas), a substitution of crude oil, is a clean energy and has witnessed a rapid development since its first application in shipping industry at the beginning of this century. Generally, fuel costs account for nearly 20-50% of the operation cost in a particular shipping company. Due to IMO's regulation on reduction of emissions of sulphur oxides, the required sulphur maximum content in fuel needs to drop from 4.5% at present to 0.5% by 2020 and from 1% down to 0.1% at present in Emission Control Areas (ECAs) for example Baltic and North sea. It's an urgent issue for shipping companies to cut emission and fuel consumption by using a cleaner fuel-mostly LNG to replace. Although major roadblocks still exists as lack of bunkering supply system and loss of cargo space occupied by LNG tanks, LNG as a ship fuel has great potential: Clean burning which meets all current and future emission standards, lower cost than diesel fuel and manageable vessel regulatory issues. Since pure LNG power ships are expensive in building which most carriers cannot afford, many new-buildings are LNG and diesel hybrid technology, so called dual fuel. This article mainly proposed three technically effective alternatives to satisfy the current and future emission control regulations and laws in shipping. LNG-diesel dual fuel power technology was introduced through feasibility study on several aspects including research development, retrofitting methods, vessel type, safety issues and other technical characteristics. Based on sample ship and route, I conducted economic evaluation on these three alternatives. Cost-effectiveness of each project was detailed in the calculation of net present value(NPV) and payback time via discount cash flow method. The findings show that LNG-diesel dual fuel power technology performs best among three alternatives. Due to the impact of fuel price on the conclusion, two scenarios were carried out in sensitivity analysis which witnessed a variation of NPV with the fluctuation of fuel price. 29.31% oil fuel slump and 35% LNG fuel rise are the turning point between project I and project III, left project II the least cost-effective method in three alternatives. And further study is recommended for the deficits of this article.

AB  - Ocean energy has many forms, encompassing tides, surface waves, ocean circulation, salinity and thermal gradients. This paper will considers two of these, namely those found in the kinetic energy resource in tidal streams or marine currents, driven by gravitational effects, and the resources in wind-driven waves, derived ultimately from solar energy. There is growing interest around the world in the utilisation of wave energy and marine currents (tidal stream) for the generation of electrical power. Marine currents are predictable and could be utilised without the need for barrages and the impounding of water, whilst wave energy is inherently less predictable, being a consequence of wind energy. The conversion of these resources into sustainable electrical power offers immense opportunities to nations endowed with such resources and this work is partially aimed at addressing such prospects. The research presented conveys the current status of wave and marine current energy conversion technologies addressing issues related to their infancy (only a handful being at the commercial prototype stage) as compared to others such offshore wind. The work establishes a step-by-step approach that could be used in technology and project development, depicting results based on experimental and field observations on device fundamentals, modelling approaches, project development issues. It includes analysis of the various pathways and approaches needed for technology and device or converter deployment issues. As most technology developments are currently UK based, the paper also discusses the UK's financial mechanisms available to support this area of renewable energy, highlighting the needed economic approaches in technology development phases. Examination of future prospects for wave and marine current ocean energy technologies are also discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mangroves are usually characterized by their high potential for long-term sequestration of organic carbon. Sediment accretion by these valuable habitats increased their capability of organic carbon sequestration. In this study, we aimed to examine the organic carbon sequestration of mangrove expansion (Avicennia germinans) in southern Iran. Different variables have been investigated in the sampled sediments, including delta C-13, delta N-15, TOC, TN, and C/N ratio. Our findings indicated the significant variation of measured variables in several top intervals, reflecting the existence of autochthonous and allochthonous organic substances. Our data showed that the minority of delta C-13 values are lower than -23\% in the S3 site, suggesting that mangrove litter is a critical input OC (delta C-13, -28 to -30\%). On the other hand, the significantly higher value of delta C-13 (-14 to -23\%) indicates that phytoplankton and possibly local microphytobenthos are the primary sources of organic materials inputs. Moreover, site S4 presents the highest mean value of C/N, TN, and delta N-15, which can be justified because of its proximity to the estuary and supply of organic matters imported from algal sources. The substantial role of mangrove forests depositing organic carbon should be investigated in the global carbon cycle.

It is a fact that ships produce enormous air pollution emissions with high energy consumption and research has been constantly carried out on clean energy applications. LNG as an alternative clean marine fuel to run on ships is still at an initial stage. Different from traditional energy resources, LNG may generate risks in the process of application. Security alarm control system will effectively monitor risk sources preventing the occurrence of danger. Based on the deep analysis of the pros and cons of the existing structure and mode of security alarm control system of LNG-fueled vessels combined with the work and risk characteristics of marine engine, storage tanks and gas supply piping which have different danger sources, design a new type security alarm control system to optimize the structure design and logic control mode and implement functions of automatic detection, alarm and device control of combustible gas from risk sources. The system is stable and reliable with easy operation effectively reducing the risks of LNG-fueled ships.

AB  - Environmental issues and rising fuel prices necessitate better energy-efficiency in all sectors. Shipping industry is one of the stakeholders in environmental issues. Shipping industry is responsible for 3 % of global CO 2 emissions, 14-15 % of global NO X emissions and 16 % of global SO X emissions. Shipping industry also has critical role in global economy since 90 % of world trade goods are carried by ships. This trade has little or no alternate means of transportation other than ships at this point and foreseeable future. In addition, shipping is a better environmental option for transportation compared to other available means of transportation due to lowest gCO 2/ton.km emissions. European Union (EU) and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are pushing hard to regulate emissions in all sectors. International Maritime Organization (IMO) is working on regulating emissions from shipping with unprecedented attention and it seems clear that emissions from shipping will be regulated within few years. Furthermore, continuously rising fuel prices are also a reason to focus on new ways for better energy-effectiveness in addition to better environmental performance. Green ship concept requires exploring and implementing technologies/practices on ships to reduce emissions. Propeller efficiency is an important area to increase efficiency and reduce emissions since propellers are merely around 60 % efficient. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the propeller efficiency options to increase efficiency and reduce emissions. The paper will discuss basic concepts and principles, and popular technologies for enhancing propeller efficiency. The author will also comment on the core-issues and challenges, and scope for future development in propeller efficiency area. Â© 2012 IEEE.

AB  - The stringent environmental regulations along with the LNG fuel penetration and the development of port and bunkering facilities render the use of the dual fuel engines an attractive alternative of the traditional ship propulsion plants based on diesel engines running with HFO for reducing both the plant operating cost and environmental footprint. The present study deals with the computational investigation of a large marine dual fuel (DF) engine of the four-stroke type for comparing its performance and emissions, in both the diesel and gas operaitng modes by using the commercial software GT-ISE. The engine diesel model was initially set up and calibrated to adequately represent the engine operation. Subsequently, the engine dual fuel model was further developed by considering the injection of two different fuels; methane in the cylinder inlet ports and pilot diesel fuel into the engine cylinders. The derived results were analysed for revealing the differences of the engine performance and emissions at each operating mode. In addition, the turbocharger matching was investigated and discussed to enlighten the turbocharging system challenges due to the completely different airâˆ’fuel ratio requirements in the diesel and gas modes, respectively. Finally, parametric simulations were performed for the gas mode at different loads by varying the pilot fuel injection timing, the inlet valve closing and the inlet manifold boost pressure, aiming to identify the engine settings that simultaneously reduce the CO2 and NOx emissions considering the airâˆ’fuel ratio operation window limitations. The parametric study results are discussed to infer the engine optimal settings. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recently, the stringent international regulations on ship energy efficiency and NOx emissions from ocean-going ships make energy conservation and emission reduction be the theme of the shipping industry. Due to its fuel economy and reliability, most large commercial vessels are propelled by a low-speed two-stroke marine diesel engine, which consumes most of the fuel in the ship. In the present work, a zero-dimensional model is developed, which considers the blow-by, exhaust gas bypass, gas exchange, turbocharger, and heat transfer. Meanwhile, the model is improved by considering the heating effect of the blow-by gas on the intake gas. The proposed model is applied to a MAN B\&W low-speed two-stroke marine diesel engine and validated with the engine shop test data. The simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental results. The accuracy of the model is greatly improved after considering the heating effect of blow-by gas. The model accuracy of most parameters has been improved from within 5\% to within 2\%, by considering the heating effect of blow-by gas. Finally, the influence of blow-by area change on engine performance is analyzed with considering and without considering the heating effect of blow-by.

AB  - With fuel consumption of marine vessels accounting for an increasing portion of global fuel usage, improving the energy efficiency of vessels is essential for saving fuel and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Hybrid-electric propulsion technologies offer a solution by interfacing multiple power sources, including batteries, with sophisticated energy management systems. An Agile Power Management System for marine vessels is presented by a Babcock led consortium with the University of Warwick (WMG) and Potenza Technology Ltd. The aim of this Innovate-UK funded project is to take advances in automotive energy management techniques and develop a modular marine power management system, addressing the latest guidance and legislation for marine applications. The system employs novel power management algorithms developed using Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) modelling techniques. Capable of interfacing energy storage with multiple power sources and loads, the algorithms seek to maximise overall efficiency by improving prime-mover operational envelopes, hence reducing emissions and fuel consumption.

TI  - Effects of Temperature on Transparent Exopolymer Particle Production and Organic Carbon Allocation of Four Marine Phytoplankton Species
JO  - Biology-basel
PY  - 2022
VL  - 11
IS  - 7
AB  - TEP is the bridge mediating DOC and POC conversion in the ocean, which is a key component of the marine carbon cycle. TEP accelerates the accumulation or deposition rate of organic carbon at the sea surface and promotes the short- and long-term sequestration of carbon, counteracting atmospheric CO2 increase and global warming. Temperature, as the main driving factor of carbon fixation during phytoplankton photosynthesis, is closely related to TEP production. However, little is known about the effects of temperature on TEP the production, DOC secretion, and carbon pool allocation of phytoplankton. This study analyzed the effect of temperature on the carbon pool allocation of phytoplankton and the significance of TEP in the marine carbon pool. Our results suggest that increased temperature affects carbon pool allocation in phytoplankton cells by promoting DOC exudation and extracellular TEP formation. This study provides an important basis for understanding the contribution of TEP to the allocation of POC and DOC and will benefit the prediction of phytoplankton TEP production and the marine carbon cycle under the background of global warming. Transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) are sticky polymeric substances that are commonly found in the periphery of microbial cells or colonies. They can naturally flocculate smaller suspended particles into larger aggregates and thus play a crucial role in the biological pump and the global carbon cycle. Phytoplankton are the major contributors to marine TEP production, whereas the way TEP production interacts with abiotic factors at the species level is generally unknown but critical for estimating carbon fluxes. In this study, the effects of temperature on TEP production and carbon allocation were studied in two representative diatom species (Nitzschia closterium and Chaetoceros affinis) and two model dinoflagellate species (Prorocentrum micans and Scrippisella trichoidea). The results showed that temperature had a significant impact on TEP production in all species. First, increased temperature promoted the TEP production of all four species. Second, elevated temperature affected the carbon pool allocation, with enhanced dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exudation in the form of TEP in all species. The TEP-C/DOC percentages of N. closterium and P. micans were 93.42 +/- 5.88\% and 82.03 +/- 21.36\% at the highest temperature (24 degrees C), respectively, which was approximately two to five times higher than those percentages at 16 degrees C. In contrast, TEP's contribution to the POC pool is lower than that to the DOC pool, ranging from 6.74 +/- 0.79\% to 28.31 +/- 1.79\% for all species. Moreover, phytoplankton TEP production may be related to cellular size and physiology. The TEP content produced by the smallest N. closterium (218.96 +/- 15.04 fg Xeq./mu m(3)) was similar to 5 times higher compared to P. micans, S. trichoidea, or C. affinis. In conclusion, TEP production is temperature sensitive and species specific, which should be taken into consideration the regarding TEP-mediated oceanic carbon cycle, particularly in the context of global warming.

AB  - This paper addresses experimental and numerical validation of power output efficiency about an approximate complex-conjugate control with considering the copper loss (ACL) method. A bottom-fixed point absorber type wave energy convertor (WEC) model was used for the experiments carried out at National Maritime Research Institute, Japan (NMRI). In order to model a power take-off (PTO) system constructed by a permanent magnet linear generator (PMLG), a liner shaft motor (LSM) was used for the model test. To investigate characteristics of the ACL method, the resistive load control (RLC) method and approximate complex-conjugate control (ACC) method were also tested by the WEC model. A simulation code based on WEC-Sim (Wave Energy Converter SIMulator) v2.0 written by MATLAB/Simulink, which is developed by collaboration works between the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia), was used for the validation. The simulated results in regular waves have good agreement with measured ones in terms of the float heave motion, the vertical force and the control input force. Through the experiments and numerical simulations in regular waves, the ACL method has advantages in high power production compared with the RLC and the ACC methods for the WEC model. In addition, the power output characteristics of the ACL method in irregular waves were checked experimentally and numerically. Â© 2017 ASME.

TI  - Demonstration of fuel switching on oceangoing vessels in the Gulf of Mexico
JO  - Journal Of The Air And Waste Management Association
PY  - 2012
VL  - 62
IS  - 9
AB  - Switching fuels from high-sulfur heavy fuel oils (HFO) to lower sulfur marine gas oils (MGO) on an oceangoing vessel (OGV) can substantially reduce both PM and SOx ship stack emissions, potentially resulting in significant human health and environmental benefits in Gulf of Mexico port communities. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) established an emission control area (ECA) within 200 nautical miles of the U.S. and Canadian coastlines and French territories off the coast of Canada with lower fuel sulfur standards effective beginning August 2012, where OGVs will need to switch from HFO to MGO. However, some operators and other stakeholders, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, may be unfamiliar with the benefits and requirements and ship operators may be concerned over potential implications for cost and operations. This first-ever U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-sponsored fuel switching demonstration in the Gulf of Mexico was initiated to showcase the environmental and health benefits of, as well as operational issues associated with, fuel switching through the following activities: (1) Fuel switching was conducted on typical container ships operating the Gulf of Mexico, as routine fuel switching has been demonstrated in California in recent years. Two vessels were employed in the demonstration: the Maersk Roubaix, which switched fuels entering Port of Houston, TX, and the Port of Progreso, Mexico, and the Hamburg SÃ¼d vessel Cap San Lorenzo, which switched fuels entering the Port of Houston and the Mexican Ports of Veracruz and Altamira. Operational and cost aspects were also noted. (2) Emissions reductions were quantified through both a calculation approach based on fuel use of the Maersk Line vessel Roubaix and in-stack monitoring of emissions from the Hamburg SÃ¼d Cap San Lorenzo. Pollutant emissions including PM, SOx, NOx, and PM component speciation were sampled during use of both fuels. These observations showed reductions (1-6%) in NOx and substantial reductions in PM (50-70%) and SOx (&99%) depending on engine and load. (3) Emission inventories at three ports were calculated. (4) Potential health and environmental benefits to communities and ecosystems in the Gulf of Mexico were estimated through screening-level modeling of air dispersion and atmospheric deposition of ship emissions at the Port of Veracruz to indicate the substantial reductions available through fuel switching.The United States and Canada have recently adopted a North American Emission Control Area that will require a shift from high-sulfur to low-sulfur fuels in the marine transportation sector. Cleaner fuels are expected to reduce sulfur and particulate emissions. This paper verifies the feasibility of such switching operations, the potential to reduce emissions if extended to the Gulf of Mexico, and the associated environmental impacts of these emission reductions inland and to sensitive ecosystems.

AB  - It is time for Wave Energy Conversion (WEC) to be part of the sustainable energy toolbox at a utility level. Solar and wind renewable power systems are now sustainable technologies which are economically competitive with existing fossil fuel and nuclear options. Even though there have been WEC development efforts as long as there have been industrial solar and wind efforts, WEC systems simply have never made it out of the experimental starting blocks. This paper examines prior efforts and examines why they have failed at a utility level and describes the design and engineering of emerging technologies that could make large scale wave energy conversion competitive with present state of the art large scale wind and solar projects. The SurfWEC concept is introduced as a game changing approach to achieve much lower Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) rates than are achievable with existing WEC approaches by enabling significant increases in kinetic energy input to various WEC designs.

AB  - Electrical power generation by means of renewable energies is becoming a flourishing industry with many researchers focusing on investigating new and effective ways to harness this power. This paper presents a new proposed mechanism for harnessing the potential energy of open ocean waves and the procedures of efficiently converting this energy into electricity. Unlike many of the already proposed designs that utilize linear generators, this paper exposes some light on the idea of rotational conversion using ocean waves to make use of most-readily available generators. A simple buoy, piston, connecting rod and flywheel system fixed to a platform elevated from the sea level is designed and simulated to track the wave surface for converting the linear motion into rotational motion, which will eventually turn the generator. The results are validated with experimental data collected from a laboratory wave generator. Â© 2011 IEEE.

VL  - 3
IS  - NA
AB  - This paper describes a new project trying to harmonise approaches to wave and wind modelling offshore, helping the short-term forecasting and wake research communities by establishing virtual laboratories, offering specialised workshops, and setting up expert groups with large outreach in the mentioned fields. Currently, a good number of research projects is underway on the European and national level in the fields of short-term forecasting of wind power, offshore wind and wave resource prediction, and offshore wakes in large wind farms. The purpose of this Action is to co-ordinate the activities in these related fields, to spread the knowledge gained from these projects among the partners and colleagues, and to start work on some roadmaps for the future. Therefore, the leaders of research projects are assuming the function of a multiplier towards the larger research and user community. Additionally, in the fields of short-term forecasting and offshore energy resource, Expert Groups will be formed to act as the central focus point for external stakeholders. The liaison with other groups will also include groups outside of Europe. To facilitate the spread of knowledge, a number of workshops are planned, being smaller and more focused on their topics than the usual conferences. One issue hampering the progress in our fields is the difficulty of getting access to good data. In most cases, data on offshore wind or power is strictly confidential, and also data on onshore wind power, especially in conjunction with numerical weather predictions, is not easy to come by. One example of a good testing procedure comes from the Anemos project, where in all 6 test cases were defined, to be run by all involved institutes. This idea is taken to the next level with the set-up of two Virtual Laboratories, one for offshore wake modelling, the other one for short-term forecasting. Two guides on best practices will be written, one on short-term forecasting (bringing the experiences of high wind penetration countries to those with little wind power) and one for wake modelling. In the end, this Coordination Action will also support preparation of next actions such as a Network of Excellence or an Integrated Project, connecting many additional partners within the European Research Area. The project is funded by the European Commission.

AB  - The West Coast Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership is one of the seven partnerships established by the DOE to evaluate CO2 capture, transport, and sequestration technologies best suited for different regions of the country. To address the broad range of issues associated with carbon sequestration, the Partnership has assembled a diverse consortium of state natural resource, environmental protection, and other agencies; national laboratories and universities; private companies working on CO2 capture, transportation, and storage technologies; nonprofit organizations; commercial users of CO2 such as the oil and gas industry; policy/governance coordinating organizations; and others. Characterization of the CO2 sources and sinks in the region provided the baseline data needed for analyses of best storage options. The West Coast region represents &gt; 11% of the nation's CO2 emissions. A majority of the region's total CO2 emissions come from the transportation, industrial, and utility sectors. Terrestrial sinks, both forests, and soils, represent the most tractable sinks for dispersed transportation sources.

AB  - Researchers from the University of Southern California's Viterbi School of Engineering were collaborating with Hong Kong shipowner Tai Chong Cheang Steamship Co to reduce greenhouse gas emissions caused by marine diesel engines. This partnership aims to improve the combustion efficiency in marine Diesel engines, thereby decreasing harmful pollutants created, meeting strict environmental regulations, and cutting fuel costs. To provide sustainable energy efficient solutions, the team uses transient plasma ignition (TPI) to improve the ignition and combustion process. The use of TPI showed ignition at room temperature, indicating that the formation of plasma breaks the chemical bonds in these heavy fuels, helping them to burn better. Data from a laboratory-scale single cylinder engine suggests that TPI causes hydrocarbon-based fuels to burn more cleanly and more completely. Research work is in its third phase, which the team will demonstrate that the technology can be successfully adopted in full-size engines with minimal invasive modifications.

TI  - Between Tun Mustapha and the deep blue sea: The political ecology of blue carbon in Sabah
JO  - Environmental Science And Policy
PY  - 2016
VL  - 55
IS  - P1
AB  - Coastal 'blue carbon' ecosystem resources are rich carbon stores, offer extensive benefits beyond carbon sequestration, and are marginalized in global markets and policy mechanisms. The participation of blue carbon project activities in international market frameworks is limited by a dearth of appropriate research across disciplinary boundaries, particularly in terms of the cultural and political dynamics that affect project implementation. The socially and politically charged contexts of many developing countries constrain project opportunities, and understanding specific local governance dynamics is therefore of critical importance to policy makers, development practitioners, and the private sector. This paper applies a systems-based political ecology research and analytical approach to explore the social and political dynamics affecting the potential development of blue carbon projects in a proposed marine reserve in Sabah, Malaysia. The investigative focus is situated in its historical context, described and mapped as an influence system in collaboration with local experts, with the elements of that system then explored in detail, through a workshop, survey, and interviews with a diverse range of local stakeholders. Key findings include that historical realities play a vital role in present relationships; effective governance is likely to require international collaboration to minimize inequity and corruption; race and religion continue to be used as tools of political imperialism; and dominant actors in Sabah would be well advised to recognize the growing, informed cohesion of Sabahan society, and its drive for equitable, ecologically sustainable development. The paper contributes a novel methodological approach to sustainability science research, provides unique data on a case study area relevant to climate change policy, and identifies important leverage points for the development of blue carbon finance and policy instruments in South-East Asia and beyond.

AB  - A study of overtopping flow series on the Wave Dragon prototype, a low crested device designed to maximise flow, in a real sea, is presented. This study aims to fill the gap in the literature on time series of flow overtopping low crested structures. By comparing to a simulated flow the characteristics of the overtopping flow are discussed and the simulation algorithm is tested. Measured data is shown from a storm build up in October 2006, from the Wave Dragon prototype situated in an inland sea in Northern Denmark. This wave energy converter extracts energy from the waves, by funnelling them to run-up a ramp and overtop into a reservoir. This water is stored at a higher level than the average sea surface, before being discharged through hydro turbines. The waves, device sea handling and overtopping flow are measured by pressure transducers ahead of, beneath and in the device. Comparisons of the distribution and correlation show that the measurements support the use of the algorithm for generating a simulated flow. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A South Korean air lubrication system fitted to Maran Gas' latest newbuilding marks the first seagoing reference for the technology in the LNG carrier (LNGC) domain. The 173,600 cu m-capacity Maran Gas Andros, employs dual-fuel, two-stroke machinery, and incorporates membrane-type cargo containment. The air lubrication system (ALS), devised by DSME, injects air under the ship to create a continuous layer between the hull and seawater, improving fuel efficiency by reducing frictional resistance on the voyage. An integrated control system monitors and adjusts the ALS in real-time to optimize its efficiency. The Greek-flag LNG tanker is expected to cut its fuel consumption by around 5% compared to similar vessels, on similar trading profiles, that do not use the energy-saving method. Further indication that the concept is gaining momentum and credibility among the LNGC community as a means of conserving fuel and reducing emissions has recently been expressed by an initiative taken by Shell International Trading &amp; Shipping Company. The tanker and gas carrier operator have signed a framework agreement with UK-based Silverstream Technologies to retrofit the latter's solution to an unspecified number of LNGCs\ in the Shell fleet. The 295-meter Maran Gas Andros is powered by two LNG dual-fuel, low-speed engines of the G70ME-C9.5-GI type, in five-cylinder configuration, manufactured by Hyundai Heavy Industries under license from MAN Energy Solutions. Using exhaust gas recirculation, the propulsion plant fulfils IMO Tier III NOx emission requirements in both gas and fuel oil mode, as well as cutting SOx and CO2, and raises fuel efficiency significantly in relation to a standard LNGC.

AB  - It is generally accepted that the carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere should be reduced to limit its adverse effects on the earthâ€™s climate. Alongside strategies to reduce CO2 emissions and improve the energy efficiency of industrial processes, technological approaches to climate change mitigation such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) are increasingly subject to debate. CCS represents one option in a larger portfolio of mitigation strategies for climate change. It consists of three distinct technological stages: separation, capture, and storage (also referred to as sequestration). CO2 released by combustion processes in power plants is separated from other emissions and captured. After transport to a suitable storage location, CO2 is isolated for extended periods to prevent its release into the atmosphere. The increasing relevance of CCS can be attributed to the fact that scientists suspect the existence of a huge number of geological formations on land and under the oceans with characteristics suitable for the storage, or geosequestration, of CO2.

AB  - Grid-forming control is required for wind turbines when they are connected to diode rectifiers. Taking the power characteristics of diode rectifier into account, we propose a grid-forming control named reactive power-synchronization control. This control consists of active power-voltage loop, reactive power-frequency loop, and voltage-current double inner loop. With the active power-voltage loop, the active power of the wind turbine can be used to control the amplitude of the AC voltage. With the reactive power-frequency loop, the reactive power of the wind turbine can be used to control the frequency of the AC voltage. With the voltage-current double inner loop, the wind turbine current can be quickly regulated and limited to avoid the converter from damage due to the overcurrent. The results show that, when the offshore wind turbine is connected to a diode rectifier, the AC voltage amplitude is closely related to the active power, while the AC voltage frequency is more sensitive to the reactive power; and that the wind turbine can maintain reliable synchronous operation under start-up, power fluctuation and AC fault when the proposed control is used. A simulation model containing four wind farms is built in PSCAD/EMTDC, and the results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the reactive power-synchronization control. Â© 2022 Science Press.

AB  - Since the 11th Five-year Plan period (2006-2010), China Classification Society (CCS) has launched a range of technical documents regarding the design, management, verification, and evaluation of ship energy efficiency and green standards. To promote the development of inland green shipping, CCS has combined its analyses on inland waterway vessels and inland shipping to set up an inland green ship standardization framework, which include one set of rules and three sets of guidelines. CCS has also developed application software for ship energy efficiency management and operational management systems, as well as software for the calculation of ship's energy consumption distribution. The classification society has also started research on high energy efficient technologies, e.g., LNG dual-fuel engines, heat pump technology, solar power technology, and shore power technology. All these initiatives have showed CCS technical capability in green shipbuilding and also helped build momentum for the sustainable development of China's shipping and shipbuilding industries.

TI  - Public perceptions of blue carbon in South Korea: Findings from a choice experiment
JO  - Marine Policy
PY  - 2022
VL  - 144
IS  - NA
AB  - Blue carbon has been recently recognized worldwide as one of the various carbon reduction measures. There are three types of blue carbon in the South Korean Ocean: salt marsh, seagrass meadow, and tidal flat. This article strives to assess the economic value of blue carbon judged by the public by the use of a choice experiment (CE). Chosen attributes for the CE application were the area of salt marsh, the area of seagrass meadow, and the number of tidal flats. A CE survey of 1000 households was successfully implemented throughout the country. All the estimates for the three attributes and price held statistical significance. The yearly household economic values arising from one unit (1 km(2)) increase in each attribute were computed to be KRW 202 (USD 0.18), KRW 238 (USD 0.21), and KRW 331 (USD 0.30), respectively. This quantitative information can be used in calculating the economic benefits of a blue carbon restoration project and performing cost-benefits analysis on the project. The results demonstrate that for all three types of blue carbon, the economic benefit of restoring 1 km (2) of each blue carbon type was at least five times greater than the cost of restoring it. In other words, the restoration of blue carbon is socially profitable.

AB  - Hydrate-based CO2 storage/sequestration (HBCS) technique could potentially fulfill the mandate of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 toward efficient and safe storage of CO2 through successful lab-scale experimentation in overcoming the existing storage capacity challenges. In this article, we carefully reviewed and discussed the reported fundamental lab-scale experimental attempts to successfully store CO2 as hydrate in sediments. The CO2 hydrate formation thermodynamics, kinetics, and mechanism insights in porous media are critically discussed to reveal the state of the art and the current challenges facing the implementation of the HBCS technique and provide guidelines and pathways toward a high CO2 storage capacity. In addition, factors affecting CO2 hydrate formation and hydrate formation mechanisms in various types of porous media are discussed. Factors that mainly control the CO2 storage capacity in porous media are driving force, porosity, capillary effect, gas and liquid permeability, particle size, and surface area. However, mass transfer limitation, potential storage site, CO2 transportation, CO2 injection technique, cost, environmental constraints, and CO2 stability are the main challenges toward the technological readiness of the HBCS.

AB  - Carbon stored in coastal wetland ecosystems is of global relevance to climate regulation. Broadscale inventories of this "blue" carbon store are currently lacking and labour intensive. Sampling 23 salt marshes in the United Kingdom, we developed a Saltmarsh Carbon Stock Predictor (SCSP) with the capacity to predict up to 44 % of spatial variation in surface soil organic carbon (SOC) stock (0-10 cm) from simple observations of plant community and soil type. Classification of soils into two types (sandy or not-sandy) explained 32 % of variation in SOC stock. Plant community type (five vegetation classes) explained 37 % of variation. Combined information on soil and plant community types explained 44 % of variation in SOC stock. GIS maps of surface SOC stock were produced for all salt marshes in Wales (~4000 ha), using existing soil maps and governmental vegetation data and demonstrating the application of the SCSP for large-scale predictions of blue carbon stores and the use of plant community traits for predicting ecosystem services.

JO  - Aquaculture
PY  - 2021
VL  - 542
IS  - NA
AB  - Global fish consumption is expected to reach 194 million tonnes by 2026 (FAO, 2017). As a result, careful consideration must be given to the environmental impacts of aquaculture expansion, including potential pollution of receiving waters with effluent from the growth and processing of fish products. The main aim of this study was to improve fish processing wastewater treatment by reducing the dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration and chemical oxygen demand using bioaugmentation, through the application of newly isolated halotolerant, protease-producing bacteria. Five halotolerant bacteria strains were isolated and identified as Marinirhabdus sp., Vibrio sp., Alteromonas sp., Alteromonas macleodii, and Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus based on 16S rRNA sequence phylogenetic analysis. Marinirhabdus sp. and Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus showed significantly higher efficiencies of COD and nitrate, nitrite and ammonium removal compared with the non-bioaugmented control. The COD and nitrogen concentration in fish wastewater treated with Marinirhabdus sp. and Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus were 93 mg L-1, 95 mg L-1, and 66.7 mg L-1, 53.3 mg L-1, respectively, with a decrease in total nitrogen synchronous with the degradation of nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium. This work demonstrated that wastewater bioaugmentation represents an effective treatment for saline, fish processing wastewater, and could be used as a robust method for the removal of organic matter and nitrogen in saline fish wastewater.

AB  - The harvesting of renewable energy sources has become increasingly important to take account of the gradual decline of fossil fuel reserves and the environment degradation associated with the use of fossil fuels. Wind energy, as one of the most well-known renewable energy sources, has been extensively harnessed across the world. Nevertheless, the wind energy exploitation in Hong Kong is still rare. Based on 6-year wind data recorded at five meteorological stations with different terrain conditions, this study presents a statistical analysis of the wind characteristics and wind energy potential at typical sites in Hong Kong by the assistance of Weibull distribution model. The variations of mean wind speed, as well as Weibull parameters, were highlighted on various timescales. Among all the sites, the annual Weibull scale parameter varied from 2.85 m/s to 10.19 m/s, and the range of the annual shape parameter was 1.65-1.99. The highest Weibull scale parameter was observed at a hilltop, whilst the lowest was found at an urban site. The monthly variation of wind power density was presented and discussed for each site. Hilltops and offshore islands demonstrated prominently greater wind power density than urban areas. It was thus indicated that hilltops and offshore islands are the most promising locations for wind energy exploitation in Hong Kong. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The maritime transport industry continues to draw international attention on significant Greenhouse Gas emissions. The introduction of emissions taxes aims to control and reduce emissions. The uncertainty of carbon tax policy affects shipping companies' fleet planning and increases costs. We formulate the fleet planning problem under carbon tax policy uncertainty a multi-stage stochastic integer-programming model for the liner shipping companies. We develop a scenario tree to represent the structure of the carbon tax stochastic dynamics, and seek the optimal planning, which is adaptive to the policy uncertainty. Non-anticipativity constraint is applied to ensure the feasibility of the decisions in the dynamic environment. For the sake of comparison, the Perfect Information (PI) model is introduced as well. Based on a liner shipping application of our model, we find that under the policy uncertainty, companies charter more ships when exposed to high carbon tax risk, and spend more on fleet operation; meanwhile the CO2 emission volume will be reduced.

In this paper, based on the traditional diesel power plant, introducing the diesel/new energy hybrid power plant, the energy constitution for ocean-going fishing vessels is analyzed towards low-carbon. By investigating the power requirements of main propulsion, sub-engine power generation and auxiliary boiler system for the ocean-going fishing vessels during operations process, the energy consumption characteristic of it is researched. Based on this, combining the assessment reports of intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) and global warming potential (GWP), considering carbon emission of production for new energy power plant, the carbon-emissions of ocean-going fishing vessels with diesel power plant and diesel/ new energy hybrid power plant are all quantified. The necessity of new energy application in fishing vessels is verified by numerical example.

AB  - A fully reversible axial flow pump-turbine is a device that can work as a turbine and as a pump for both forward and reverse directions of flow. These machines find applications in tidal power plants. Double-cambered S-shaped profiles are known to be better suited for the blades of such machines; however, information on the aerodynamic characteristics of S-cambered profiles is very limited. The effect of thickness distribution on the performance of S-shaped airfoils is considered in this paper. The results obtained from an extensive experimental aerodynamic investigation of three S-cambered profiles with different thickness distributions are presented. Gottingen 775 and NACA 0010-66 basic thickness distributions were used to obtain these profiles. The profiles were tested in a wind tunnel in forward and reverse directions of flow. The variation of lift and drag coefficients and that of lift-to-drag ratio with angle of attack were obtained. The study showed that among the profiles tested the profile with Gottingen 775 thickness distribution having a maximum thickness at 30% chord is best suited for fully reversible axial pump-turbine application from the point view of high lift-to-drag ratio.

However, the reliability of wind information suffers from the relative scarcity of offshore wind measurements to validate the wind models used in assessments. This paper presents a comparison of the publicly available NOAA-CFSR global reanalysis data set against offshore wind measurement collected in West Africa, Mediterranean Sea, Barents Sea and NW Australia, with the goal to investigate - in widely different meteorological conditions - the overall model reliability, in term of statistical indices of performance: Moreover, an attempt has been made to ascertain the representative averaging duration of model wind and the reliability of engineering formulas used to correlate wind of different averaging durations.

AB  - The offshore wind power is becoming an important development direction in the field of wind generation. In offshore wind farm, submarine cables are widely used to transmit power, which makes the resonance problem more serious due to the cables' high grounding capacitor. The power collecting system determines the cables'length, electric parameter and connection type, which directly affects the resonance frequency and impedance. This paper builds the resonance model of offshore wind farm transmission system, including wind generators, cables and transformers. Using modal analysis method, the resonance situations under different power collecting systems are simulated and calculated. The key nodes causing resonance are located by the participation factor. The main parameters' influence on resonance is evaluated with parameter sensitivity analysis. Finally, the filtering solution is proposed for different resonance frequency, which is proved to be effective by simulation results. Â© 2016, Power System Protection and Control Press.

AB  - There is a growing interest in placing wind farms in offshore China subsequent to the success of the first Chinese offshore wind farm at Donghai Bridge, Shanghai which started operation in 2010. Most offshore wind farms in China are located at intertidal areas where the water depth varies greatly and the sea bed has a deep soft soil layer. Consequently, the foundations for the Chinese offshore wind turbines will be different from the more common monopile or jacket structures used in Europe. This study assesses the wind turbine installation from the first Chinese offshore wind farm and proposes cost effective designs for the wind turbine installation vessels and also for the service vessels which are suitable for Chinese offshore wind farm conditions. This poster is related to Statoil's task to address the offshore conditions for a wind farm design tool in an ongoing EU funded collaborative wind research project.

JO  - Energy Procedia
PY  - 2015
VL  - 80
IS  - NA
AB  - Considerable variations in environmental site conditions can exist within large offshore wind farms leading to divergent fatigue loads on support structures. An efficient frequency-domain method to calculate wave-induced fatigue loads on offshore wind turbine monopile foundations was developed. A verification study with time-domain simulations for a 4MW offshore wind turbine showed result accuracies of more than 90% for equivalent bending moments at mudline and interface level. This accuracy and computation times in the order of seconds make the frequency-domain method ideal for preliminary design and support structure optimization. The model is applied in sensitivity analysis of fatigue loads using Monte-Carlo simulations. Local and global sensitivity studies and a probabilistic assessment give insight into the importance of site parameters like water depth, soil stiffness, wave height, and wave period on fatigue loads. Results show a significant influence of water depth and wave period. This provides a basis for design optimization, load interpolation and uncertainty analysis in large wind farms.

AB  - Aquaculture faces substantial challenges in mitigating the detrimental environmental impacts of intensive farming. Traditional methods have given rise to serious concerns, leading to the search for alternative approaches using probiotics. An indigenously isolated photosynthetic purple bacterium, Rhodovulum sulfidophilum, was introduced into a marine integrated multitrophic aquaculture system cultivating Chanos chanos in southwestern Taiwan. The effects of R. sulfidophilum on water quality parameters, the relative levels of nitrogenase-encoding nifH and nitrous oxide reductase-encoding nosZ genes, the occurrence of sulfonamide resistance, the presence of sulfonamide resistance genes, and microbial community structure were determined. Supplementation with R. sulfidophilum decreased the chemical oxygen demand, the nitrate levels, and the occurrence of sulfonamide-resistant bacteria in the fishpond water compared with that of the control after rearing. The level of the sulfonamide resistance gene sul2 decreased in R. sulfidophilum-supplemented water samples, while the control exhibited an elevated level of sul2 after rearing. Supplementation with R. sulfidophilum also maintained the integrity of the bacterial community structure. In conclusion, our results suggest that R. sulfidophilum is an attractive supplement for enhanced disease emergence control, microbial biodiversity maintenance, and sustainable marine aquaculture practice.

AB  - To prevent accidents in the construction stage of an offshore wind farm (OWF), this paper proposes the fuzzy fault tree analysis method to evaluate the safety of OWF. The kernel of the proposed method is to identify the risk factors leading to accidents in the construction stage of OWF using historic accident data and expert investigation, so as to establish the OWF fault tree in the construction stage. The basic event probability obtained by using fuzzy numbers instead of incomplete data is used to iteratively solve the risk level of the top event, and the Fussell-Vesely importance (FV-I) is employed to evaluate the contribution of each basic event. The result demonstrates that the fuzzy fault tree in the construction stage of OWF cannot only identify the risk factors but also give comprehensive evaluation opinions. Â© 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Wave energy has a great potential to solve the unrelenting energy deficiency in Egypt. The present work recommends Wells turbine as a suitable choice for the Egyptian coasts due to its simple and efficient operation under low input air flow. In addition, the possibility of extracting the wave energy from the Egyptian coasts was investigated using the oscillating water system based on real data from the site. To achieve this purpose, two-dimensional numerical models for Wells turbine airfoils, functioning under sinusoidal wave flow conditions, were built. Moreover, the running and starting characteristics under sinusoidal-flow conditions were investigated using a mathematical code. The results were discussed using the first law analysis, in addition to the second law analysis by using the entropy generation minimization method. It was found that the NACA0015 airfoil always gives a global entropy generation rate that is less than other airfoils by approximately -14\%, -10.3\% and -14.7\% for the sinusoidal wave with time periods equal to 4, 6 and 8 s respectively. Moreover, the effects of blade profile, time period and solidity on the output power (kW) value were discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The recent trend of marine industry towards more efficient and versatile ships and lower emission has increased interest in hybrid solutions. However, the spread of this technology has been limited by several factors both economic and technical. Among these, a recurrent issue is the sizing of the Energy Storage System (ESS), which is strictly connected to the vessel typology, its operation and its control system. This paper presents an algorithm, developed within Wartsila Italia SpA, for the extraction of sequential operating modes from data recorded on board the vessel, in order to properly design a feasible ESS. The paper shows a technical economic analysis carried out on a small cruise vessel in order to identify competitive hybrid solutions compared to traditional configurations (engines running on conventional fuel or Liquid Natural Gas). Finally, the paper compares two case studies of a small vessel powered only by fuel cells (in place of conventional engines) and batteries, in order to prove the potential benefits derived from such innovative technologies with different operational profiles, also in hybrid mode.

AB  - Even if researchers are working on the exploitation of marine energy for more than thirty years, blue energy is not yet a consolidated reality and still contributes marginally to the world energy mix. For this reason, in the last years, the effort of the scientific community has been significantly intensified to further improve the know-how on marine energy harvesting. The goal is to allow ocean energy to effectively contribute to a more sustainable energy production in the next future. In the wide range of technologies for wave energy harvesting, Oscillating Water Column (OWC) devices are counted among of the most mature ones. Due to the oscillating nature of the generated air flow, which continuously inverts its direction, OWC devices need to be coupled with self-rectifying turbines, such as Wells, impulse, or biradial turbines. Wells turbines can reach high efficiencies, but their performance can show a hysteretic behaviour due to dynamic stall phenomena, especially in presence of high amplitude flow rate oscillations. Moreover, under dynamic stall conditions, during the flow deceleration, the shaft torque evidence the presence of gradually damped fluctuations, which delay the flow reattachment, superposed to the hysteresys loop. In order to better characterize this phenomenon, a new experimental campaign was performed in the open wind tunnel of the Polytechnic University of Bari on a 3D-printed Wells turbine model. The interest is mainly focused on the dependency of these torque fluctuations on the amplitude and frequency of the oscillating flow. Â© 2020 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

AB  - Tidal renewable energy is one of the underdeveloped power sources that might help meet demand while lowering carbon dioxide emissions. There is enormous potential for generating power from tidal currents. It is a resource used to generate power sustainably. The construction has been developed in MATLAB Simulink of a tidal current turbine and is discussed in this paper. The twin-turbine model has been developed, and the resultant power is 37Â kW. Whenever the turbine rotor is in rotational motion, it produces mechanical power, which is then transmitted to the electrical generator. The current control strategy has been used to design a three-phase modified sine wave inverter system for a tidal energy grid-linked structure. The stationary and synchronous reference frames (SRF) are two control techniques applied to an inverter. Park transformation is using to translate AC quantity to DC in the synchronous frame. In Î±Î²-control, proportional-resonant (PR) regulators are commonly used where PI controller converts to PR, which is required for SRF control. The controller implements a phase-locked loop to monitor the power gridâ€™s phase angle which responds rapidly enough to fluctuations in demand or grid link conditions. As a consequence, it tends to be successful in providing steady voltage to the load avoiding phase jumps. Â© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - European ship operator United European Car Carriers (UECC) has successfully operated a pair of LNG-fuelled short-sea PCTC since 2016. UECCâ€™s two existing LNG-fuelled vessels Auto Eco and Auto Energy are the biggest 1A super Finnish/Swedish ice classed PCTC and the first PCTC in the world capable of operating on LNG. They are capable of sailing a 14-day round trip in the Baltic solely on LNG, storing approximately 800 cu m in a cylindrical Type C tank, and were the first clients of the worldâ€™s first seagoing LNG bunkering vessel, ENGIE Zeebrugge. The company is now building a series of three further vessels that will be the first LNG battery hybrid PCTCs in the world. The energy storage system (ESS) system will be charged by a permanent magnet, directly driven shaft generator or dual fuel generators. As part of the total power system, which includes a WinGD 6RT-Flex50DF dual-fuel engine, a controllable pitch propeller, a bulb rudder, two dual-fuel gensets and a dual-fuel boiler, the ESS will provide power to the main switchboard, peak shaving capabilities for the main engine and auxiliaries and offer black-out prevention. The vessels will only require two auxiliaries, as the ESS and the shaft generator eliminate the need for one more that would otherwise have been required. The pioneering design will take UECC beyond the IMO target of 40% reduction in carbon intensity by 2030 through the combination of optimal hull design and the LNG battery hybrid solution.

AB  - Offshore and coastal wind farms are becoming important sources of renewable energy. The energy production of a wind farm is closely connected to its location, and the expected outcome is traditionally calculated from at least I year of accurate wind measurements. Satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) wind mapping may become a useful tool in the process of selecting the optimal site for these measurements and may therefore increase the cost-effectiveness when planning wind farms. The study described in this paper is based on 28 SAR scenes from the Norwegian west coast near the town of Bergen. The wind fields retrieved from these images have been compared with in situ wind data from the Hellisoy lighthouse and modelled wind from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts. Based on long-term wind information from the lighthouse, the SAR scenes that show the most representative wind conditions for the site were chosen for the study. The data give an overview of the spatial distribution of the wind field in this coastal region. According to the SAR data, the area with the highest wind energy potential lies in the area north of Hellisoy in the mouth of Sognefjord, as this area is open to most wind directions.

TI  - POWER REDUCTION CONSIDERATIONS FOR BULK CARRIERS WITH RESPECT TO NOVEL ENERGY EFFICIENCY REGULATIONS
JO  - Brodogradnja
PY  - 2022
VL  - 73
IS  - 2
AB  - After introducing an energy efficiency design index (EEDI) in 2011, International Maritime Organization (IMO) pursued their short-and long-term goals to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships by presenting, among others, an energy efficiency existing ship index (EEXI). Contrary to EEDI which is used for new ships solely, EEXI is addressing an energy efficiency of already built ships and is set to become formally applicable starting from 2023. Existing designs cannot be essentially and rapidly changed to comply the criterion. The only main particular from the preliminary design phase that can be meaningly optimized â€œpost festumâ€ is a required engine power, and thus, the speed. Therefore, the paper explores the effect of EEXI policy on a fleet of 153 bulk carriers built between 2000 and 2020 in order to address their near future and prompt design changes, specifically considering the power reduction. For that purpose, an attained and a required EEXI are calculated for each ship. The results showed that only 15% of the ships built in 2000-2012 satisfied 2013-2014 IMO criterion. This impacted the design of ships built in 2013-2022, as they complied the same criterion by 88% of share. However, no ship from the whole database satisfied the present day EEDI requirement and only one ship fulfilled the contemporary EEXI requirement meaning that the current designs are not able to match the emerging criteria to a large extent. In order to meet an energy efficiency criterion, a main engine power reduction and speed are predicted assuming that the engine power and shaft limiter are installed. The investigation showed that MCR reduction of the total fleet taken into account had to be reduced by 50% and speed by 15% on average in order for ships to meet current requirements. Moreover, a graphic method is developed for the estimation of EEXI by using only deadweight (DWT) and maximum continuous rating (MCR). The proposed simplified method based on average values could be used on existing bulk carriers with an aim to satisfy novel regulation with application of â€œeasy to useâ€ approach. Additionally, authors discussed other options to reliably evaluate an energy efficiency of existing ships. Â© 2022, University of Zagreb Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture.

AB  - Climatic changes threaten the planet. Most articles related to the subject present estimates of the disasters expected to occur, but few have proposed ways to deal with the impending menaces. One such threat is the global warming caused by the continuous increase in CO2 emissions leading to rising ocean levels due to the increasing temperatures of the polar regions. This threat is assumed to eventually cause the death of hundreds of millions of people. We propose to desalinize ocean water as a means to reduce the rise of ocean levels and to use this water for populations that need good quality potable water, precisely in the poorest regions of the planet. Technology is available in many countries to provide desalinated water at a justifiable cost considering the lives threatened both in coastal and desertified areas.

AB  - Renewable energy has gained importance in recent years because of its cooperation in ecosystems, welfare and the circular economy. The new business model comprises new values for organizational sustainability. Moreover, renewable energy such as offshore energy is associated with innovation systems, knowledge and collaboration between organizations. The participation of the offshore energy sector has increased in the Portuguese renewable energy supply. It is known that renewable offshore energy suppliers will cover economic necessities. One of the strategies was to set up a new business model based on supplier organization networking for the construction of an offshore wind farm. This will contribute positively to lower fuel dependency, fewer imports, control of energy prices and market regulation in terms of supply/demand. The methodology used was an electronic questionnaire applied to emergent offshore energy cluster stakeholders. The SWOT analysis of the offshore energy sector contributes to an understanding of the offshore energy sector in Portugal and reveals the business model with which the stakeholders are faced. Moreover, it draws up a business strategy oriented towards competitiveness and cooperation with other energy sectors. Â© 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Economic and population growths are the most important drivers of growing global energy demand. They led to a rapid development of international seaborne trade and an increase in the number of global vessels. Air pollution from these ships is of great concerns and regulations are currently enforced since May 2005 by the International Maritime Organization to limit such pollution. In this study, we will first review the current global energy demand and its driving forces over next decades, second evaluate the existing alternative fuels that can be used as a bunker fuel to reach sustainability with relatively small changes in the existing marine propulsion options and finally focus on near-term solution, which has the potential for large-scale use. The different alternative fuels were compared in terms of several parameters such as availability, renewability, safety, cost, performance, economy and compliance with emission regulations. This comparison revealed that liquefied natural gas could be considered as the future replacement to the current marine bunker fuel. This conclusion has been further verified by comparing diesel engine with different powers when using both heavy fuel oil and liquefied natural gas. The engines were compared against fuel consumption, cost saving as well as emissions. Liquefied natural gas has proved to be better than heavy fuel oil due to fuel cost reduction by about 31% per year and decrease in emissions of SOx, NOx, CO2 and particulate matter by about 98%, 86%, 11% and 96%, respectively. The resulted emissions from using liquefied natural gas were found to comply with the current International Maritime Organization regulations. Moreover, this article highlights the latest rules and regulations that govern the use of liquefied natural gas as marine fuel onboard ships. Â© Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - CCUS (Carbon Capture,Utilization and Storage) is a crucial technology that can be used to reduce CO2 emissions of electricity generated from fossil energy and industrial process. It plays an important role in China's Carbon Neutral. CO2 geological storage is the key component of the CCUS which determines the development potential and development direction of CCUS. Therefore,establishing the evaluation method of CO2 sequestration capacity that suit for China's geologic characteristic and estimating the CO2 storage capacity of China's main basins are the foundation of the CCUS development in China. The evaluation of CO2 sequestration capacity was divided into four steps at abroad, named as country/state evaluation, basin estimate, site description, and site application, respectively. Considering geological characteristics, regional geology, assessment purpose, local protection, social health, the safety of storage and environment as key indicators for evaluation, a series of assessment indicator systems of basin estimate were established. Meanwhile,different calculation methods of CO2 sequestration capacity were put forward for different geological bodies of CO2 storage,such as CSLF (Carbon Sequestration Leaders Forum) method, DOE (United States Department of Energy) method, European Union method,and ECOFYS and TNO-TING method. The evaluation of CO2 sequestration capacity in China is in its infancy,that Unified and systematic evaluation method of CO2 sequestration capacity has not been established. The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation based on analytic hierarchy process was the main method used in CO2 sequestration capacity evaluation in China, and evaluation method of subsidiary basin estimate and solubility calculation method for CO2 sequestration capacity were put forward. China has huge potential and diversified geological bodies for CO2 geological storage, and Bohai bay basin, Songliao basin, Ordos basin, Jungar basin, Subei basin, and Sichuan basin are favorable areas for CO2 geological storage. Due to the complex geological conditions,the CO2 sequestration capacities of China obtained from different evaluation methods are to be a great discrepancy. Therefore,detailed assessment of CO2 sequestration capacity for means geological bodies urgently need to be carried out, including deep saline formations,being exploited and depleted oil and gas field, deep unminable coal seams, and shallow sea.

JO  - Greenhouse Gases-science And Technology
PY  - 2011
VL  - 1
IS  - 3
AB  - Developing reliable detection and monitoring techniques for underwater CO2 seepage and its effects on the marine environment is important for a wide range of topics; for example: volcanic surveillance, risk assessment of potential leakages from sub-seabed CO2 storage sites, and to forecast the effects of ocean acidification. A novel approach is to use areas where natural release of CO2 is present as `field-laboratories' for validation of CO2 monitoring techniques and procedures. One such area was identified close to the volcanic island of Panarea (Italy). Here, CO2 seeps from the seafloor in shallow water allowing scuba divers to collect the needed data. Moreover, the coastal setting allows use of small boats for the marine operations, thus strongly reducing the costs. The applied study techniques examined are mainly sampling methods for free and dissolved gases, direct measurement of the CO2 fluxes, pH measurement along the water column, and verification of the impact of CO2 on the local environment. From these first results, the submarine degassing area of Panarea can be realistically considered a natural laboratory where it is possible to test and validate detection methods for the prompt identification of potential seepage from sub-seabed CO2 storage areas. The particularly favorable environment permits the use of simplified logistics, thus reducing the costs of the research to almost negligible values if compared with any high-seas operation.

AB  - The accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, as well as the enrichment of water courses in nutrients are environmental issues associated to numerous impacts on ecosystems. Several attempts have been made to address these issues, but the cost and sustainability of current methodologies are still a concern. Cultivation of photosynthetic microorganisms appears as a sustainable solution because: (i) they can effectively uptake CO2 and nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus; and (ii) the resulting biomass can be processed into valuable products. In this study, the effect of different CO2 concentrations (from approximately 0.04 to 10\% v/v) on CO2 capture, biomass production and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) uptake was assessed for the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and the cyanobacteria Synechocystis salina and Microcystis aeruginosa grown at laboratory scale under batch mode. For the studied range of CO2 concentrations, C. vulgaris, S. salina and M. aeruginosa have reached the highest biomass productivities (0.126 +/- 0.033 g(dw) L-1 d(-1)) and carbon fixation rates (0.101 +/- 0.027 g(C) L-1 d(-1)). These microorganisms have also been effective in nutrients uptake, reaching removal efficiencies close to 100\%. Through mathematical modelling, it was possible to conclude that optimal CO2 concentration for these microorganisms was 5.35 +/- 0.34\% (v/v). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

JO  - Reviews In Aquaculture
PY  - 2022
VL  - 14
IS  - 4
AB  - Aquaculture is one of the most resource-efficient and sustainable ways to produce animal protein. The Food and Agriculture Organization predicts that cultivated aquatic species will provide around 53\% of the world's seafood supply by 2030. Further growth of intensive farmed aquatic species may be limited by a shortage of feed resources. The aquaculture sector therefore needs to intensify its search for alternative ingredients based on renewable natural resources. A significant increase in production will require an accelerated transition in technology and production systems, better use of natural available resources, development of high-quality alternative feed resources and exploitation of available space. The present review discusses the urgent need to identify appropriate alternative ingredients for a sustainable future salmonid production. We describe and evaluate the most promising marine ingredients, including low-trophic species (mesopelagic fish, zooplankton, polychaetes, macroalgae and crustaceans), novel microbial ingredients (bacteria, yeast and microalgae), insects (black soldier fly, yellow meal worm and crickets), animal by-products (poultry meal, meat and bone meal, blood meal and hydrolysed feather meal) and by-products from other commercial productions (trimmings and blood). Furthermore, we discuss the available volumes and need for new processing technologies and refining methods to ensure commercial production of nutritionally healthy ingredients. The essential production steps and considerations for future development of sustainable and safe seafood production are also discussed.

JO  - Biology-basel
PY  - 2022
VL  - 11
IS  - 10
AB  - Simple Summary Harmful algal blooms present a particular risk for marine ecosystems and human health alike. In this sense, it is important to accurately predict how toxin-producing microalgae could be affected by future climate change. The present study applied species distribution models (SDMs) to project the potential changes in the habitat suitability and distribution of three key paralytic shellfish toxin (PST)-producing dinoflagellate species (i.e., Alexandrium catenella, A. minutum, and Gymnodinium catenatum), up to 2040/50 and 2090/2100, across four different greenhouse gas emission scenarios, and using four abiotic predictors (i.e., sea surface temperature, salinity, current velocity, and bathymetry). In general, considerable contractions were observed for all three species in the lower latitudes of their distribution, together with projected expansions into higher latitudes, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. This study aims to entice further research on the future biogeographical impacts of climate change in toxin-producing microalgae species while, at the same time, helping to advise the correct environmental management of coastal habitats and ecosystems. Toxin-producing microalgae present a significant environmental risk for ecosystems and human societies when they reach concentrations that affect other aquatic organisms or human health. Harmful algal blooms (HAB) have been linked to mass wildlife die-offs and human food poisoning episodes, and climate change has the potential to alter the frequency, magnitude, and geographical extent of such events. Thus, a framework of species distribution models (SDMs), employing MaxEnt modeling, was used to project changes in habitat suitability and distribution of three key paralytic shellfish toxin (PST)-producing dinoflagellate species (i.e., Alexandrium catenella, A. minutum, and Gymnodinium catenatum), up to 2050 and 2100, across four representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP-2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5; CMIP5). Despite slightly different responses at the regional level, the global habitat suitability has decreased for all the species, leading to an overall contraction in their tropical and sub-tropical ranges, while considerable expansions are projected in higher latitudes, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, suggesting poleward distributional shifts. Such trends were exacerbated with increasing RCP severity. Yet, further research is required, with a greater assemblage of environmental predictors and improved occurrence datasets, to gain a more holistic understanding of the potential impacts of climate change on PST-producing species.

TI  - OCEAN-ATMOSPHERE CO2 EXCHANGE - AN ACCESSIBLE LAB SIMULATION FOR CONSIDERING BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS
JO  - Climatic Change
PY  - 1994
VL  - 27
IS  - 3
AB  - Phytoplankton is considered a key component mediating the ocean-atmospheric exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen. Lab simulations which model biological responses to atmospheric change are difficult to translate into natural settings owing in part to the vertical migration of phytoplankton. In the sea this vertical migration acts to regulate actual carbon dioxide consumption. To capture some critical properties of this vertical material transfer, we monitored the effects of atmospheric CO2 on dense suspensions of bioconvecting microorganisms. Bioconvection refers to the spontaneous patterns of circulation which arise among such upwardly swimming cells as alga, protozoa, zoospore and large bacteria. Gravity, phototaxis and chemotaxis have all been implicated as affecting pattern-forming ability. The ability of a biologically active suspension to detect atmospheric changes offers a unique method to quantify organism adjustment and vertical migration. With increasing CO2, bioconvection patterns in alga (P. parva) and protozoa (T. pyriformis) lose their robustness, and surface cell populations retreat from the highest CO2 regions. Cell movement (both percent motile and mean velocity) generally diminishes. A general program of image analysis yields statistically significant variations in macroscopic migration patterns; both fractal dimension and various crystallographic parameters correlate strongly with carbon dioxide content.

VL  - 234
IS  - 1
AB  - A generalized CO2 emission benchmark (energy efficiency design index) cannot be established for inland ships in a similar fashion like the one established by International Maritime Organization for seagoing vessels. Difference in environmental, geographical and economic conditions, for example, shallow and restricted water effects, different fuel quality (to reduce operational cost), reduction in speed, increase in engine power, reduction in carrying capacity and cargo availability, forbids the direct use of energy efficiency design index as formulated by International Maritime Organization. These conditions have been addressed at first in this research, and revision of some parameters is presented for calculating energy efficiency design index for inland cargo ships of Bangladesh. Moreover, the ship data stored at different organizations of Bangladesh deviate from the existing ship data. As a result, the collected data have undergone through several verification processes. Based on the verified real data, CO2 emission benchmark for inland cargo ships of Bangladesh was established. This benchmark is one of the world's first CO2 emission benchmark for inland cargo shipping. This benchmark will force ship designers of Bangladesh to design more energy efficient ships that will consume less energy per ton-mile. It is interesting to note that the energy efficiency design index curve for inland cargo ships using revised energy efficiency design index parameters is below the energy efficiency design index curve using International Maritime Organization formulation. The prime reasons behind this fact have also been explained in this research.

TI  - Model simulations of carbon sequestration in the northwest Pacific by patch fertilization
JO  - Journal Of Oceanography
PY  - 2006
VL  - 62
IS  - 6
AB  - Iron fertilization of nutrient-rich surface waters of the ocean is one possible way to help slow the rising levels of atmospheric CO2 by sequestering it in the oceans via biological carbon export. Here, I use an ocean general circulation model to simulate a patch of nutrient depletion in the subpolar northwest Pacific under various scenarios. Model results confirm that surface fertilization is an inefficient way to sequester carbon from the atmosphere (Gnanadesikan et al., 2003), since only about 20% of the exported carbon comes initially from the atmosphere. Fertilization reduces future production and thus CO2 uptake by utilizing nutrients that would otherwise be available later. Effectively, this can be considered as leakage when compared to a control run. This "effective" leakage and the actual leakage of sequestered CO2 cause a significant, rapid decrease in carbon retention (only 30-45% retained after 10 years and less than 20% after 50 years). This contrasts markedly with the almost 100% retention efficiency for the same duration using the same model, when carbon is disposed directly into the northwest Pacific (Matsumoto and Mignone, 2005). As a consequence, the economic effectiveness of patch fertilization is poor in two limiting cases of the future price path of carbon. Sequestered carbon in patch fertilization is lost to the atmosphere at increasingly remote places as time passes, which would make monitoring exceedingly difficult. If all organic carbon from one-time fertilization reached the ocean bottom and remineralized there, acidification would be about -0.05 pH unit with O2 depletion about -20 Î¼ mol kg-1. These anomalies are probably too small to seriously threaten deep sea biota, but they are underestimated in the model because of its large grid size. The results from this study offer little to advocate purposeful surface fertilization as a serious means to address the anthropogenic carbon problem.

JO  - Naval Engineers Journal
PY  - 2012
VL  - 124
IS  - 1
AB  - As a ship's hull condition degrades due to marine fouling, more power and fuel are needed to maintain service speeds. One by-product of this increased fuel consumption is increased greenhouse gas emissions. Rising fuel costs, hull maintenance expenses, and mounting environmental regulations make hull condition monitoring a crucial tool for prudent ship operators, to eliminate energy waste due to hull fouling, to reduce carbon emissions, and to eliminate the carriage of invasive species between ports. Methods for using a ship's propeller as a power absorption dynamometer employ the propeller as a measuring instrument to estimate either speed or power. The calibration is typically performed for clean hull conditions, allowing the resulting propeller model to be used to track ship performance degradation due to hull fouling against a standard ``clean-hull{''} baseline. The propeller power absorption technique is presented, along with the salient results of using it to monitor two U.S. Navy sister ships over a one-year long time period. This information may be useful for U.S. Navy decision makers who are responsible for hull/propeller maintenance and hull paint selection

This type of renewable energy intends to provide many types of benefits, including reduced dependency on fossil fuels, improved air quality, and a hedge against volatile price fluctuations in electricity markets. However, the US has not yet addressed some of the legal and regulatory issues that are associated with this new form of energy production. Although certain federal and state laws currently apply to such projects, legal gaps exist. In addition, there are unresolved environmental, social, and planning issues that must be addressed before widescale development of offshore wind occurs in US waters.

AB  - Sea trade is an important element of international trade. There are huge number of ships at worldwide, and they emit huge amount of emissions accordingly. Stricter emission regulations are entered into force, and will be entered into force in the future by the International Maritime Organization and EU to control and reduce these emissions. To comply with these regulations, alternative fuels are in use. The alternative fuelled ship number is in increase. Despite the alternative fuel usage at maritime industry increases, there are not any alternative fuel courses at the maritime universities to educate the marine engineering students. In this study, a new course about the alternative fuels, their related systems, and operation is proposed for the training of the marine engineering students. Competences at the STCW amendments for the persons who work on alternative fuelled ships are taken into account while preparing the course topics. Each topic is paired with basic and advanced training competences of the STCW amendments, and compliance with the STCW is provided. Lastly, the course topics and sub-topics are explained for the guidance to prepare the alternative fuel course. Â© The Authors.

AB  - Geoengineering has been defined as purposeful action intended to manipulate the environment on a very large-especially global-scale. Some researchers point out that our present manipulation of atmospheric CO2 content could be considered geoengineering, so that we are really discussing what type of geoengineering is appropriate. Geoengineering has been promoted as our fall-back option for combating global warming. However, like carbon capture and sequestration, geoengineering schemes are single-purpose technical fixes for climate change mitigation, which would leave the questions of energy availability and other global environmental problems untouched. Crucially, it does nothing to address the 'other' CO2 problem-ocean acidification. In this chapter we will restrict our discussion to large-scale schemes directed at counteracting the effects of rising GHGs by altering the Earth's albedo-the proportion of insolation that is reflected back to space. A large number of schemes have been proposed, some of which would alter the planetary albedo as a whole, while others would act on a more regional scale, with correspondingly more regional effects. Geoengineering can be implemented rapidly, and at projected costs much lower than the alternatives. Research shows, however, that it is not possible to simultaneously bring about present temperature and precipitation conditions. Because costs and benefits would be unevenly distributed across countries, it would also be very difficult, politically, to implement.

They suggest that a large-scale CCS network could be built along the east coast of the UK, which would use pipeline network to carry CO 2 from industries to local storage facilities called hubs, pumping the gas onwards to offshore underground reservoirs. The researchers stressed that more research needs to be done to improve current technologies for capturing CO 2 so that they use less energy and are more cost effective to run. Governments will also need to develop credible policies and regulatory frameworks to assess and manage the economic, health, legal and environmental issues associated with the full-scale use of CCS.

IS  - NA
AB  - Preliminary studies demonstrate the availability of significant renewable energy potential in Spanish waters. Its use could contribute to achieving the recently updated national objectives for the generation of clean energy in the future National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030. Despite the different initiatives that were unsuccessfully proposed at the end of the 2000s, the current implementation of blue energy is practically zero in Spain due to the characteristics of the marine space, which limits the technical and economic viability of the projects. There are other factors, such as a complex regulatory framework, inadequate administrative processes, limited availability of information as well as social rejection of this type of facility. Like other Member States of the European Union, Spain is currently developing a process of maritime spatial planning (MSP) that should be concluded, according to RD 363/2017, with the approval of a maritime spatial plan (POEM) for each of the five existing marine demarcations. This planning will have consequences for the uses and activities of the marine environment, including marine renewable energies. It also provides an opportunity to address existing non-technical barriers and promote the deployment of blue energy facilities. This investigation studies the MSP landscape in Spain from a holistic perspective and analyzes the repercussions of future POEMs in the offshore wind sector and other marine renewable energies. It concludes by proposing a set of recommendations, based on previous experiences in other regions, aimed at facilitating the integration of clean energy policies in the future uses of this marine space.

TI  - Wave energy converter arrays: Optimizing power production while minimizing environmental effects
JO  - Proceedings Of The Annual Offshore Technology Conference
PY  - 2019

AB  - The nascent marine renewable energy (MRE) industry requires robust tools to maximize power output while evaluating the potential environmental effects of marine hydrokinetic (MHK) devices. Wave energy converter (WEC) devices in particular, are in early stages of development and may deploy a wide range of technologies to harness wave energy. The technical activities and processes used to assess WEC arrays for both power production and environmental effects requires streamlining to lower the levelized cost of wave energy projects and facilitate timely, cost-effective environmental review and compliance. A robust approach using numerical models to simulate the WEC devices and array layouts is presented that simultaneously evaluates power production and assesses environmental effects. "WEC-friendly" open-source numerical tools have been developed that are capable of assessing the environmental force on and potential changes to the environment caused by the energy extraction by WEC arrays. A case study is presented to demonstrate how the changes in WEC array configurations can be mapped and quantified using a validated model. A discussion of how changes in WEC devices and array configurations are developed to provide critical information on both engineering and environmental risk. This allows for optimization of WEC deployments to maximize power capture while minimizing environmental impacts. Â© 2019, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - Conceptual design of OTEC plants producing desalinated water with the gas hydrate method
JO  - NANA
PY  - 1992
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - The present paper examines the possibility of producing desalinated water by forming gas hydrates within cold seawater at high pressures. This method is not new, but its coupling with OTEC may present some interesting benefits. Typical heats of hydration are about one fifth of the heat of water vaporization, thus yielding prospects for desalination outputs larger than with Open-Cycle OTEC flashing, and for a more efficient use of deep seawater resources. The resulting fresh water and brine are virtually as cold as the original deep seawater, so that a full thermal difference remains available for an OTEC plant downstream, or for other applications like air-conditioning. However, desalination power consumption for optimal outputs would exceed OTEC power generation, based on the same cold seawater flow rate: therefore, this plant would have to be viewed as a desalination unit that could provide fresh water at about 5 kWh per 1000 liters, with an external power supply, unless it uses the partial seawater flow of a larger self-sufficient OTEC system.

AB  - Research the influence of curved blades of tidal turbine on gaining power and loss of hydrokinetic energy. An improved genetic algorithm relies on the mutation factor under adaptive active control to avoid the local best solution, and the adaptation function introduces a probe model to lessen the number of algorithm iterations. An improved genetic algorithm (IGA) and hydrodynamic simulation method are applied in an optimized model of the blade curvature coefficient. The curvature coefficient of the blade is optimized based on the energy model gained by the turbine. The results show that when bending depth and chord length is (0.06, 0.20), the tip speed ratio is 0.557.Compared with other blades, when the incident angle is 12 Â°, loss of hydrokinetic energy of the optimized blade is lessen by 16%. In the region with high tip speed ratio (<0.8), the power generation coefficient of the optimized blade remains relatively stable.

JO  - Spe Latin American And Caribbean Petroleum Engineering Conference Proceedings
PY  - 2014
VL  - 1
IS  - NA
AB  - Brazilian pre-salt oils should contain a variable concentration of dissolved CO2, which is produced in the gas phase. A sustainable production of these oils requires a destination for the produced gas. As offshore fields have limitations associated to gas manipulation, storage and exportation, miscible CO2 flooding is an Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) method with great potential to be employed in pre-salt reservoirs. In fact, miscible CO2 injection in highly heterogeneous reservoirs should increase the oil production. As CO2 flooding is related to high gas mobility, an alternative EOR method is water-alternating-gas injection (WAG). The WAG with CO2 (WAG-CO2) is advantageous in this scenario due to the sea water available apart from enabling the control of gas mobility. In addition, using CO2 as an injection fluid is a viable solution for the GHG problem. Before implementation of WAG injection in a field, the prediction of the oil production through reservoir simulation is recommended. Simplified Black-Oil modeling is not appropriate to simulate a reservoir with light oil and miscible CO2 injection. The rigorous simulation of WAG injection requires a compositional model. Also, hysteresis of relative permeability should be implemented in the simulation model to consider the cyclic hysteresis of the three-phase relative permeability. The case studied has analogous characteristics of pre-salt reservoirs such as light oil with 8% molar of CO2 and initial reservoir conditions of low temperature and high pressure. The phase behavior of the oil and CO2 mixture is represented by an Equation of State that contemplates the swelling resulting from the CO2 dissolution in the oil. As hysteresis modeling requires some uncertain experimental parameters, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the influence on oil recovery. The importance of using the reservoir simulation as a tool to predict the oil recovery before implementing WAG injection in practice is evidenced. It also demonstrated that the sensitivity analysis of the required uncertain parameters to consider the hysteresis is a viable approach to give the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios of light oil recovery prediction under WAG injection.

AB  - Direct electrolytic hypochlorination of surfaces exposed to the marine environment is an effective technique for prevention or removal of biofouling. The surfaces to be protected or cleaned are first coated with a thin platinum film and made the anode in an electrochemical circuit using seawater as the electrolyte. Tests demonstrated that an electrical current density as low as 0.022 mA/cm2 applied continuously to a surface exposed in ocean water for seven months prevented biofouling from occurring on that surface. Initial test results indicate that intermittent energizing of the electrochemical circuit for short periods on an 8 or 24 hour cycle is also effective in preventing biofouling. Removal of existing fouling using this technique was demonstrated on several specimens, including one with a three-month accumulation of micro- and macrofouling. The biofouling was completely removed within a 24-hour period using a current density of 0.5 mA/cm2. Â© Copyright 1980 Offshore Technology Conference.

JO  - Ships And Offshore Structures
PY  - 2016

AB  - Management of energy consumption constitutes the major challenge in marine shipping industry for the next generation. It has received a large attention from both scientific researchers considering consumption, economic and environmental impact; and industrial experiments supported by marine engine manufacturing companies and other governmental and non-governmental entities. Over the years, many solutions have been put forward to overcome the effects of this problem, while maintaining the amount of goods transported globally at the same transfer rate and ship speed. The present paper sheds light on many of the methods used currently to reach this purpose. We argue that applying a certain fuel-saving strategy will rely on some factors, the most important of which is the type of ship. Mainly two methods, including shore-side power and cold out of heat strategies, have been investigated regarding adaption, economic, and environmental issues in case of applying onboard high-speed passenger ships. This concept has also been applied on a vessel operating in the Red Sea region for applicability and benefits of this approach. It was determined that the proposed two-step strategies significantly reduce the consumption of fuel onboard the ship by about 310 ton per year, and in addition, considerably reduce the amount of ship emissions, which could reach more than a thousand tons per year.

AB  - The risk associated with storage of carbon dioxide in the subsurface can be reduced by removal of a comparable volume of existing brines (e.g. Buscheck et al., 2011). In order to avoid high costs for disposal, the brines should be processed into useful forms such as fresh and low-hardness water. We have carried out a cost analysis of treatment of typical subsurface saline waters found in sedimentary basins, compared with conventional seawater desalination. We have also accounted for some cost savings by utilization of potential well-head pressures at brine production wells, which may be present in some fields due to CO2 injection, to drive desalination using reverse osmosis. Predicted desalination costs for brines having salinities equal to seawater are about half the cost of conventional seawater desalination when we assume the energy can be obtained from excess pressure at the well head. These costs range from 32 to 40 cent per m(3) permeate produced. Without well-head energy recovery, the costs are from 60 to 80 cent per m(3) permeate. These costs do not include the cost of any brine production or brine reinjection wells, or pipelines to the well field, or other site-dependent factors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Projection of Future Global Offshore Wind Energy Resources using CMIP Data

IS  - 2
AB  - Offshore wind energy has the potential to ease energy and environmental crises, improve people's living standards on remote islands, and, finally, make contributions to sustainable development. Accurate energy evaluations should be performed before the exploitation of offshore wind energy; this includes not only assessments of the resource's historical characteristics but also a focused effort on understanding future issues. Using simulated wind data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, phase 5 (CMIP5), this paper compares and analyses wind energy characteristics globally for the 2080-2099 period (future) relative to the 1980-1999 period (past). The classification of both past and future wind energy is also presented. The results show a positive trend for future global offshore wind energy. Compared with the past, the extent of areas with wind power density (WPD) greater than 400 W m(-2) will expand. In the future, across most of the global oceans, the effective wind speed occurrence and the occurrence of a WPD higher than 200 W m(-2) will be greater than that in the past, generally by 10\%. The extents of the sub-rich, available, and poor regions will decrease, while the regions with a wind energy class of 7 will expand. The future wind energies of the North and South Poles show a ``seesaw{'' phenomenon.

AB  - Microbial reverse-electrodialysis electrolysis cell (MREC) is a new type of bioelectrochemical technology which is developed by coupling electrical energy generated by microorganisms with salinity-gradient energy between seawater and freshwater. In this study, a MREC was established aiming to produce H2O2 in the cathode chamber. The effects of operating conditions and influencing factors on H2O2 generation and power generation were investigated. The results show that the flow rate of seawater and freshwater and the salinity gradient were the key factors influencing the production of H2O2. The maximum H2O2 production, 711.4 mgâ€¢L-1, was obtained when the flow rate of Seawater and Freshwater was 2 mLâ€¢min-1 and the concentration of Freshwater was 0.35 gâ€¢L-1. Under this condition, the H2O2 production rate also reached a maximum value of 33.65 mgâ€¢L-1â€¢h-1, and the cathode recovery rate was 19.77%. Correspondingly, the power density reached 1.25 Wâ€¢m-2. The MREC reactor can obtain a high H2O2 production rate without applying external energy, which provides a new route for green production of H2O2. Â© 2019, Science Press. All right reserved.

Inversed switching pattern between the two HVDC tap results in small current fluctuation and realizes additional low dc power outputs. This circuit topology is expected to be applied to a dc transmission system for offshore wind power, etc. In this paper, the operating characteristics are discussed in detail based on simulation study.

AB  - Hybrid technology in marine vehicles can significantly reduce fuel consumption and local CO2 emissions. It has been applied successfully to several ship-types, mostly with conventional, rule-based, strategies. To further improve performance, intelligent control strategies are necessary. This work, inspired by automotive research in Energy Management Strategies, applies the Equivalent Consumption Minimisation Strategy (ECMS) to a ship powered by a hybrid propulsion plant with hybrid power supply that can be recharged with renewable shore power. This hybrid configuration has the additional challenge to determine the optimal power-split between three or more different power sources, in real-time, and to optimally deplete the battery packs over the mission profile. To this end, a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear optimisation Problem is formulated and solved by combining Branch &amp; Bound and Convex optimisation. Dynamic Programming (DP) is used to benchmark the real-time strategies, which are also compared to the current rule-based (RB) controller. Simulation results of a case study tugboat with validated models show that, with unknown load demand, 6% additional fuel savings can be achieved with ECMS. Â© 2018

AB  - Since the 1980s phycological research efforts have been made in the Macaronesian Region, largely focusing on the floristics and systematics of those macroalgae present at the archipelagos of the Azores, Madeira, Selvagens, Canaries, and Cabo Verde Islands. Major publications from those studies have allowed cataloging the diversity of macroalgae growing along their volcanic coastlines, but have also described the historical and current uses of some seaweeds. Perhaps most importantly, potential industrial applications from selected seaweeds could result in novel economic resources and income generation as key elements of the Blue Economy Strategies in the region. This review presents the seaweed resources from the Macaronesia Region, which collectively includes 52 taxa, of which-9 greens, 14 browns, and 29 reds are cataloged. Some geographic areas, e.g., the Cabo Verde Islands and Madeira, require more intense field research in order to investigate selected, target seaweeds of interest which may become new marine resources for commercial exploitation. Future development of this emerging marine biotechnological sector will depend on the sustainable management of wild stocks, as well as implementation of culture techniques for biomass production, adapted to the environmental and socio-economic conditions of the respective archipelagos. In parallel, capacity building actions are foreseen to boost the large potential of Macaronesian seaweeds as key elements of the local Blue Economy.

AB  - The cable routing problem is the task of designing theminimum-cost electrical network between the turbines of offshore wind farmswhile satisfying several constraints. It contributes to decreasing wind energycosts, favoring the green transition. This paper focuses on balanced cablerouting, studying both branched and radial network topology. First, we proposea visibility graph to route cables around obstacles and boundaries present inthe wind farm area. Next, we develop a novel Large Neighborhood Search (LNS)heuristic using neighborhoods of increasing complexity: swap, exchanging two turbines between root-branches; double swap, exchanging two pairs of turbines; cycle swap, moving turbines between root-branches; and re-partition, re-partitioning and re-routing two adjacentroot-branches. We also extend the LNS heuristic to the unbalanced branchedconfiguration to compare to existing literature. On average, it finds solutionsof the same quality using two orders of magnitude less run-time, improving thesolutions in five cases. Â© 2022 The Authors. Networks published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Algae Systems LLC has designed and implemented a novel approach to wastewater treatment in which municipal wastewater is used to cultivate microalgae in modular, offshore photobioreactors (PBRs). At the Algae Systems plant in Daphne AL, this process was used to treat up to 50,000 gal/day of incoming raw wastewater. A combination of algae nutrient uptake, aeration by photosynthetically produced oxygen, and dewatering via suspended air flotation removed 75\% of total nitrogen, 93\% of total phosphorus and 92\% BOD from influent wastewater. Offshore PBRs contained evolving polycultures of microalgae and associated heterotrophs, with community composition shifting based on the dynamic external and internal environment. During one year of operation, microalgae composition shifted from dominance of Scenedesmus dimorphus to a diverse polyculture dominated by genus Chlorella, Cryptomonas and Scenedesmus. ``The more, the merrier{''} approach to species richness produced resilient communities, enabling efficient nutrient uptake due to niche complementarity and eliminating process downtime due to biological disruptions. The resulting biomass was suitable for fuel conversion via hydrothermal liquefaction due to consistent lipid content, low ash content, and consistent elemental composition. Biomass production rates ranged from 3.5 to 22.7 g/m(2)/day during continuous operation, with productivity predominantly driven by temperature and frequency of harvest. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Blue carbon has gained recognition as a strategy to mitigate climate change. Mangroves allow significant amounts of carbon to be sequestered and stored and are considered an important component in the offset of greenhouse gas emissions. Despite this, little is known about the ecosystem-level carbon storage of the mangrove stands of Mauritius, western Indian Ocean. We conducted an inventory of mangrove stands to characterise forest stand structure and estimate carbon stocks in terms of aboveground biomass and soil carbon at two sites, Ferney and Pointe d'Esny. Different allometric equations relative to species (for areas dominated by Rhizophora mucronata or Bruguiera gymnorrhiza) were used for aboveground biomass, and the loss-on-ignition method was used for estimating soil carbon. The results showed that aboveground biomass ranged from 54.57 Mg ha(-1) to 328.71 Mg ha(-1), and soil carbon from 99.11 +/- 18.35 Mg ha(-1) to 133.45 +/- 30.35 Mg ha(-1). The total ecosystem carbon stock ranged from 402.35 +/- 19.29 Mg ha(-1) to 427.81 +/- 18.35 Mg ha(-1) at Ferney, and from 188.03 +/- 30.35 Mg ha(-1) to 189.72 +/- 19.27 Mg ha(-1) at Pointe d'Esny. Our results underscore the importance of mangrove forest stands and highlight the need for in-depth and broader spatial-scope research on blue carbon ecosystems in Mauritius.

AB  - In order to cut down carbon dioxide emission from shipping industries, ammonia is proposed as an alternative marine fuel oil recently. The applicability of ammonia as marine fuel is firstly analyzed in this paper in the aspects of carbon reduction potential, maturity system, infrastructure, and economy. It is proved and shows that ammonia fuel is one of the best alternative fuels for ships in the long term. To understand the feasibility of ammonia fuel as a clean alternative fuel for ships in the future, three-dimensional combustion model of a diesel engine 4135Aca was established by Solid Works software and CONVERGE software. The combustion simulation blended with ammonia fuel was carried out, so that the combustion characteristics in cylinder and emission characteristics out of diesel engine were obtained. When 1%, 5%, 8% and 9% ammonia is injected into air intake port, the combustion pressure and temperature inside cylinder will increase, due to extra work of the diesel engine, while CO2 emission decreases by 18.7%, because of the delayed ignition time. These results indicate that the injection of ammonia fuel can increase diesel engine power and reduce CO2 emissions, but it also causes combustion delay and a little increase of NOX, which should be paid attention to in the future application of ammonia fuel on board ships.

AB  - Gas and particulate emissions from ship transportation have been increasing in recent years. In order to mitigate ship emissions near coastal areas, voluntary vessel speed reduction incentive programs (VSRIPs) were put in place by a number of ports. This paper studies a schedule design problem faced by liner shipping companies under VSRIPs. It proposes a mixed-integer nonlinear mathematical model for the minimization of the total cost, consisting of fuel cost, as well as operating cost, minus dockage refunds. The model balances three determinants, that is, the compliance of VSRIPs, the speed limit (the maximum physical speed of ships and the upper speed limit imposed by VSRIPs), and the limited number of ships. An enumerative algorithm and a piecewise-linear approximation algorithm are developed, based on some properties of the nonlinear model. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms is validated through extensive computational experiments.

The objective of this paper is to establish a body of knowledge for real-time risk analysis and its application to autonomous (unmanned) ships. A three-pronged systematic literature review is conducted focusing on the research topics of real-time risk analysis, autonomous ships and finally real-time risk analysis of autonomous ships. It yields a considerable number of results for the former two with 80 and 55 research studies respectively, whereas a sparse 15 research studies for the latter indicating a recent interest in this topic. The study acts as a guide for future researchers working within real-time risk analysis of autonomous shipping, and for developing real-time risk models for autonomous ships. It is equally applicable to other autonomous marine systems. Â© 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets for international shipping revealed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) involves at least 50% reduction by 2050, while pursuing efforts towards zero emission as soon as possible. IMO's strategy itself details a pathway of CO2 emissions reduction consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goals. The strategy also targets a minimum 40% decline in carbon intensity of international shipping to reduce CO2 emissions per transport work by 2030, a 70% reduction by 2050, compared to 2008 levels. Implementation of further phases of the energy efficiency design index for new ships will be reviewed to strengthen energy efficiency design requirements. IMO's Sub-Committee on Pollution Prevention and Response is developing guidelines to support the implementation of the 2020 sulfur limit. These guidelines will cover a range of issues related to implementation, including ship planning for implementation, verification and control issues, and fuel oil non-availability reporting.

AB  - The main features that characterize the modem shipping industry are: safety at sea and marine environment protection. It is the electric propulsion system that most easily fulfills these conditions. Combining the propulsion and auxiliary drive systems, the ship has a unique system, where the possibility of power saving and reduction in harmful exhaust gas emission effect becomes the most prominent one. The control system of a power plant includes automatic control of prime movers, its start-up or close-down according to priority with regard to deficit or surplus of required power. This system enables prime movers to run in the optimum range of 85\% maximum continuous rating and, as a consequence, exhaust gas emission is additionally reduced.

TI  - Port-city exhaust emission model: An application to cruise and ferry operations in Las Palmas Port
JO  - Transportation Research Part A: Policy And Practice
PY  - 2015
VL  - 78
IS  - NA
AB  - Exhaust emissions cause air pollution and climate change. The exhausts of shipboard fuel combustion are equally damaging particularly, so close to the environmentally sensitive mainland and island coasts, as well as at ports due to their urbanized character. This paper estimates, for the first time, exhaust pollutants related to cruise and ferry operations in Las Palmas Port and, in an island context. Emission assessment is based on a full bottom-up model and messages transmitted by the Automatic Identification System during 2011. Results are described as a breakdown of NOx, SOx, PM2.5, CO and CO2, according to ship classes, operative type and time, providing valuable information to environmental policy makers in port-city areas and islands under similar conditions. It is generally concluded that vessel traffic and passenger shipping in particular are a source of air pollution in Las Palmas Port. Emission maps confirm location of hot spots in quays assigned for cruise and ferry operations. Policy recommendations encourage regular monitoring of exhaust emissions and market-based incentives supported by details on polluting and operative profiles. On the other hand, feasibility studies are suggested for automated mooring, LNG bunkering facilities and also shore-side energy services, prioritizing berthing of shipping sectors (or sub-sectors) with the highest share of exhaust emissions once their local effects have been confirmed by a dispersion, exposure and impact assessment.

AB  - Offshore wind Energy demonstrated to be one of the most promising technologies for growing electric energy demand worldwide. The main objective of this research was to conceive a floating offshore structure for supporting wind turbines. The Mediterranean Sea is characterized by deep water, especially in the western area, from Italy towards Spain, and this makes floating support structures desirable, since in deep water they are cheaper than bottom fixed piles [1]. An aerodynamic, electric and mechanic model was developed and tested against experimental results of laboratory and wind tunnel tests on a small scale wind turbine, demonstrating its reliability, so it was used to determine actions on the floater and a first concept design was performed using commercial software for marine structures analysis. Further steps in this process will include integration of the turbine model with hydrodynamic calculations, as well flume, tank and open sea tests for the designed floater.

AB  - International maritime transport organizations are proposing regulatory actions and strategies aimed at decarbonizing the sector to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which currently constitute around 3% of the global total. Hybrid propulsion systems have significant potential in this respect, as a means of power-saving in ships. This paper describes a high-fidelity benchmark for hybrid-electric vessels, combining diesel generators and batteries. The benchmark consists of detailed models, the parameters of which are provided so that the models can be reproduced. The proposed hybrid-electric ship topology and control system was validated using real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations on a Typhoon HIL402 platform. The results provide a detailed analysis of the operation of the different components under varying conditions, which should be useful in prototyping these kinds of systems. In addition, the response of the system was evaluated with regard to potential disturbances resulting from the control systemâ€™s operation. The results show the system performed correctly during these transitory events, with no undesirable responses. Â© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Heavy fuel oil (HFO) is a residual product of the refinery process and is inconsistent in quality. For optimum combustion, some processing is required and many vessels are fitted with viscosity booster units or fuel conditioning units. Emerson?s Micro Motion Viscomaster Viscosity meters accurately measures the viscosity, density, and temperature of the HFO enabling it to be treated as necessary. The Viscomaster meters are tolerant of harsh environments such as onshore and offshore power plants, and provide reliable, accurate control with little or no maintenance or recalibration. Emerson?s Micro Motion Coriolis mass flowmeters have been used for the measurement of fuel oil to provide accurate, mass-based measurement. Using the Modbus communications protocol, the mass flowmeter sends data to a fuel efficiency control system, which collects information from the flowmeter and other onboard systems, optimising ship operations. Emerson?s new Micro Motion Certified Marine Bunker Measurement Solution, which includes the Micro Motion Elite Coriolist meter, Series 3000 transmitter and Marine Bunker Transfer Package, is the first traceable, transparent, mass-based measurement system for HFO bunkering and monitors fuel deliveries, minimizing disputes between barge and ship..

TI  - Vascular Plants Are Globally Significant Contributors to Marine Carbon Fluxes and Sinks
JO  - Annual Review Of Marine Science
PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - NA
AB  - More than two-thirds of global biomass consists of vascular plants. A portion of the detritus they generate is carried into the oceans from land and highly productive blue carbon ecosystems-salt marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows. This large detrital input receives scant attention in current models of the global carbon cycle, though for blue carbon ecosystems, increasingly well-constrained estimates of biomass, productivity, and carbon fluxes, reviewed in this article, are now available. We show that the fate of this detritus differs markedly from that of strictly marine origin, because the former contains lignocellulose-an energy-rich polymer complex of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin that is resistant to enzymatic breakdown. This complex can be depolymerized for nutritional purposes by specialized marine prokaryotes, fungi, protists, and invertebrates using enzymes such as glycoside hydrolases and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases to release sugar monomers. The lignin component, however, is less readily depolymerized, and detritus therefore becomes lignin enriched, particularly in anoxic sediments, and forms a major carbon sink in blue carbon ecosystems. Eventual lignin breakdown releases a wide variety of small molecules that may contribute significantly to the oceanic pool of recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon. Marine carbon fluxes and sinks dependent on lignocellulosic detritus are important ecosystem services that are vulnerable to human interventions. These services must be considered when protecting blue carbon ecosystems and planning initiatives aimed at mitigating anthropogenic carbon emissions. Â© 2020 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.

AB  - Shipping emissions are expected to grow together with world trade. For this reason, the European Union is targeting shipping emissions both by penalizing the use of fossil fuels and by creating incentives for the shipping sector to increase the role of alternative fuels. This research presents an estimate of when and with what assumptions low-carbon and carbonâ€“neutral maritime fuels will be competitive against fossil fuels, while also examining what will be the cost impact on an individual vessel. The results show that the prices of low-carbon and carbonâ€“neutral fuels are likely to remain high compared with fossil fuels, here assuming the currently planned regulation. The planned regulation, together with the estimated fuel price developments, will significantly increase fuel costs. The cost-optimal fuel path complying with the planned regulation is from fossil fuels via biofuels to electrofuels. Â© 2022 The Authors

PY  - 2015
VL  - 34
IS  - 2
AB  - Mangroves play an important role in sequestering carbon and trapping sediments. However, the effectiveness of such functions is unclear due to the restriction of knowledge on the sedimentation process across the vegetation boundaries. To detect the effects of mangrove forests on sediment transportation and organic carbon sequestration, the granulometric and organic carbon characteristics of mangrove sediments were investigated from three vegetation zones of four typical mangrove habitats on the Leizhou Peninsula coast. Based on our results, sediment transport was often ``environmentally sensitive{''} to the vegetation friction. A transition of the sediment transport mode from the mudflat zone to the interior/fringe zone was often detected from the cumulative frequency curve. The vegetation cover also assists the trapping of material, resulting in a significantly higher concentration of organic carbon in the interior surface sediments. However, the graphic parameters of core sediments reflected a highly temporal variability due to the sedimentation process at different locations. The sediment texture ranges widely from sand to mud, although the sedimentary environments are restricted within the same energy level along the fluvial-marine transition zone. Based on the PCA results, the large variation was mainly attributed to either the mean grain size features or the organic carbon features. A high correlation between the depth and delta C-13 value also indicated an increasing storage of mangrove-derived organic carbon with time.

TI  - Waste lube-oil based fuel characterization in real conditions. Case study: Bottom-trawl fishing vessel powered with medium speed diesel engine
JO  - Fuel
PY  - 2018
VL  - 215
IS  - NA
AB  - The high-fuel dependency of the shipping industry and its corresponding pollutant emissions need to be addressed within the new de-carbonisation era. Concurrently, the waste-to-energy concept arises to drive sustainable initiatives for energy production. In that sense, in the present study, the feasibility of an alternative fuel oil (AFO) based on recycled-waste lubricating oil was assessed. Tests were conducted on board a bottom-trawler fishing vessel, under real operating conditions. The fishing activity was monitored, and the engine performance, the combustion and injection properties, and the emissions characteristics were studied. The vessel performance when operating on the AFO was compared with that when operating on standard distillate diesel oil (DFO). The results showed that the AFO required preheating up to 70 Â°C owing to its higher viscosity value, which is considerably higher than the allowed by the ISO 8217 standard for distillate fuels. Therefore, a heating module was installed on board the vessel to ensure optimal performance with the AFO. The fuel consumption was slightly lower for the AFO; however, owing to its higher low-heating value, the engine efficiency was higher when using the DFO. The AFO presented lower combustion pressure than the DFO and a longer combustion period; however, its ignition process occurred earlier. The results suggested that the AFO contained light components which caused the early ignition of the fuel, as well as heavy components, which delayed the end of the combustion. The NOX emissions were considerably reduced with the AFO by 15%; the CO2 emissions were slightly reduced as well; however, CO emissions were higher for the AFO by 15%. By operating under the usual conditions while burning the AFO throughout a year, the vessel would consume 8 t of fuel less, and would emit 21 t of greenhouse gases less. The vessel burnt a total of 40,000 L of AFO, for approximately 300 h, without any operational issue. The results demonstrate that the distillate fuel obtained from lubricating oil is suitable for marine medium-speed engines and enables satisfactory performance. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd

The hydrodynamic calculation with frequency-domain models was performed to find out the optimum wave period for the wave energy converter. The results in this paper were obtained by using the Boundary Element Method (BEM). The characteristic function expands of velocity potential in the cylindrical coordinate system was applied to limit computational domain and improve computational speed. The hydrodynamic performance of the device was assessed. The influence of hydraulic damping coefficient was evaluated. Focus was given to the capture width ratio, motion of the device and optimal hydraulic damping coefficient. After 2 years of construction in the shipyard, the device was constructed and an open sea test had been finished near WanShan Island, South China Sea. During the test, the daily power generation and power curve of the device were measured.

IS  - NA
AB  - Shipping in concerns of eco-friendly and economical efficient operation can be achieved by many different measures. Most of them are technological approaches, e.g by changing engine control parameters, usage of different fuels, exhaust gastreatment systems or internal measures to make the engine itself more efficient or eco-friendly. The lost part in this measures is, that there are still humans who are in charge of controlling the vessel and that they should be kept in the loop of efficiency. For numerous vessels, it is neither efficient nor economically reasonable to exchange or enhance the existing power generation or propulsion systems in order to improve efficiency or reduce emissions. Some internal measures even lead to a higher fuel consumption in order to reduce NOx-emissions. Therefore optimal operational procedures for handling ships and specifically the outcome of engine manoeuvres is a substantial source for eco-friendly ship operations. The German research project MEmBran (Modelling Emissions and Fuel Consumption during Ship Manoeuvres) addresses especially the basis for optimising ship engine manoeuvres. It focusses on a very detailed simulation of the processes of currently existing ship diesel engines (in a first step 4-stroke engines) in order to apply them within a more comprehensive ship handling simulation software. As a part of an existing planning andprediction software that can be used on board, it enables the watchkeeping nautical officer and the shipping company to forecast and compare the fuel consumption of the ship for each manoeuvre. It further allows to identify the best option of the ship operator's possible actions under several conditions and afterwards a comparison of varying manoeuvre strategies of different navigators will be enabled

PY  - 2019
VL  - 41

AB  - Concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and climate change have raised global demand for renewable products, leading to increased interest in sustainable resources. Microalgae constitute a potentially sustainable source of natural compounds, such as phospholipids, which are extensively used in cosmetics as part of liposomes, emulsifiers, solubilizers, and wetting agents. Currently phospholipids are extracted from food sources, a practice that raises sustainability concerns. Photosynthetic microalgae cultivated on nitrogen and phosphorus macronutrients may serve as a more sustainable source of the major phospholipids phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, lyso-phosphatidylcholine, and lyso-ethanolamine. We assessed the effect of nitrogen and phosphorous provision on phospholipid production by the marine microalga Nannochloropsis oculata cultivated in a 3.5-liter flat panel photobioreactor at two macronutrient mass ratios, NO3-/PO43- = 15 and NO3-/PO43- = 5. Using organic solvent extraction and P-31 NMR spectroscopy, phospholipid content in cell mass was found to be 26\% higher at the ratio of 5 than at the ratio of 15, indicating that phosphate-rich cultivation boosts phospholipid formation. Moreover, the specific growth rate of the culture at the ratio of 5 was higher than at the ratio of 15. After the growth phase the cultures were subjected to macronutrient starvation, a common practice for increasing total lipid production. Therefore, maintaining a NO3-/PO43- ratio of 5 is deemed to be essential for exploiting microalgae for large scale production of phospholipids.

AB  - The power generation using rich natural resources is an important measure to solve energy supply problem in an island away from the mainland and without large power grids. It helps to construct an ecological and environmental-protective island, stimulate the development of oceanic economy and tourism industry, and improve life quality of islanders. An architecture of insular microgrid energy management system was designed, and an autonomous microgrid consisting of two kinds of renewable resources (solar and wind energy), battery energy storage system and diesel generator was established in an island on the east coast of China. A desalination unit acts as controllable load, and is put into operation when the power is excess or there is a shortage of fresh water supply. The system monitors the operating conditions of the microgrid in real time, and transmits important running information to remote Distribution Management System (DMS) through the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). The running results show that the insular microgrid energy management system can not only ensure the efficient and stable operation, but also improve the utilization of renewable energy and extend battery life.

AB  - Increase in ship energy efficiency is one of the main goals set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). In this sense the IMO identified the significance of the control and management of the hull fouling. The weed or grass stage is often seen as the beginning stage of the ship hull fouling, while the effects of soft fouling on the ship resistance and propulsion characteristics as well as on the fuel oil consumption are mistakenly underestimated. A new method for the assessment of the effect of fouling on the ship resistance and propulsion characteristics is proposed. The applicability of the proposed method is shown by comparison of the obtained resistance and propulsion characteristics using this method and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach. Within this paper the effect of soft fouling on the ship energy efficiency is evaluated. Utilizing the proposed method, the increase in the fuel oil consumption and the CO2 emission is determined for handymax bulk carrier on the route Halifax-Rotterdam for certain surface conditions. The potential benefits of the hull and the propeller cleaning are highlighted from both an economic and environmental point of view. On the observed route the potential savings in the fuel oil costs could be up to 38,000 $, while reducing the CO2 emission up to 327 t. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Tidal stream offers divinable and regular electricity generation at higher power densities than other renewable energy sources. With an increasing concern over the potential of harnessing ocean energy for electricity generation by marine current turbine (MCT) and its impact on water environment, the exploration and assessment works are required. Based on a three-dimensional ocean model with a developed marine current turbine submodel, we assessed the impacts of MCT on water environment and discussed the effect of MCT assignment on potential power extraction. The simulation results indicated that the reduction of water current velocity occurred at the installation area of MCTs. A certain amount of MCTs installed vertically to the water flow could achieve full utilization of marine renewable energy. However, more scenario simulations for MCT in different assignments should be conducted for the optimal design of MCT installation to further improve the utilization efficiency of marine renewable energy. Meanwhile, an ecosystem model would be combined with a hydrodynamic model to predict the impacts of MCT on the ecosystem. Â© 2016 IEEE.

IS  - NA
AB  - Due to intensive marine activities and the use of low-quality fuel oils, the marine transport accounts for a considerable part of air pollution in the transportation sector. Although ships provide the convenient transportation, they exhaust a large number of hazardous pollutants, especially nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur oxides (SOx), which have a significant side effect on environment and human health. To alleviate the impact of global shipping on the environment, international maritime organization established the more stringent emission regulations from Tier I to Tier III in order to reduce emissions from ships. As a result, various emission reduction technologies need to be developed in order to meet more stringent regulations in the future and reduce the pollutant emissions. Under this background, it is indispensable to examine the existing emission reduction technologies when exploring another possible method to reduce the pollutant emissions. Based on a significant number of related literatures, it is general to utilize the marine alternative fuels to reduce the pollutant emissions. Especially, liquid natural gas (LNG) is considered to be one of the most promising marine alternative fuels due to its economy and environmentally friendly features. This review thus aims to summarize the different emission reduction technologies of marine diesel engines through three reduction paths of fuel optimization, pre-combustion control and exhaust after-treatment. Furthermore, the utilization of LNG in the marine diesel engines are evaluated comprehensively from three aspects of environmental protection, energy structure and economic benefits. At the end, some suggestions on the future research are given based on the extensive review on the state-of-the-art literature. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - EEDI analysis of Ro-Pax and passenger ships in Greece
JO  - Maritime Policy \& Management
PY  - 2015
VL  - 42
IS  - 4
AB  - Within the commitment of the International Maritime Organization to control the impact of shipping on climate change, the development and recent adoption of the Energy efficiency design index (EEDI) as a measure towards curbing CO2 emissions from shipping mandates that all new ships will have to meet a gradually increased level of energy efficiency, hence ensuring that more efficient newbuildings will replace those withdrawn from service. In this article, the Ro-Pax and passenger ships operating within the domestic shipping network of Greece make a suitable reference for an EEDI analysis because of the significant number of ships deployed, whereas their design diversity provides a test for the reliability of the EEDI approach in this shipping sector. It was found that large-sized Ro-Pax vessels showed a strong negative correlation between EEDI values and gross tonnage, which is consistent with the results of other relevant studies. In a market which is characteristic of diverse vessel designs, it was demonstrated that the ``EEDI baseline{''} calculation is highly influenced by vessel design and operational characteristics, dictating the need for close monitoring of the EEDI effectiveness in this sector.

TI  - CO2 Mineralization Using Brine Discharged from a Seawater Desalination Plant
JO  - Minerals
PY  - 2017
VL  - 7
IS  - 11
AB  - CO2 mineralization is a method of sequestering CO2 in the form of carbonated minerals. Brine discharged from seawater desalination is a potential source of Mg and Ca, which can precipitate CO2 as forms of their carbonate minerals. The concentration of Mg and Ca in brine are twice those in the seawater influent to desalination process. This study used a cycle for CO2 mineralization that involves an increase in the pH of the brine, followed by CO2 bubbling, and, finally, filtration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that non-synthesized brine from a seawater desalination plant has been used for CO2 mineralization. The resulting precipitates were CaCO3 (calcite), Mg-5(CO3)(4)(OH)(2).4H(2)O (hydromagnesite), and NaCl (halite) with these materials being identified by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and thermo gravimetric-differentail thermal Analysis (TGA)-DTA. Despite the presence of Ca with Mg in brine being unfavorable for the precipitation of Mg carbonate, Mg reacted with CO2 to form hydromagnesite at a yield of 86\%. Most of the Ca formed calcite, at 99\% yield. This study empirically demonstrates that brine from seawater desalination plants can be used for CO2 mineralization.

AB  - International shipping is at a crossroads as regards decarbonization. The Paris climate change agreement in 2015 (COP21) was hailed by many as a most significant achievement. Others were less enthusiastic, and more recently American President Trump decided to take the U.S. out of the agreement. Four years earlier, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) had adopted the most sweeping piece of regulation pertaining to maritime greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction, in the name of the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI). In addition, one year after COP21, the IMO adopted a mandatory data collection system for fuel consumption of ships and agreed on an initial strategy and roadmap on the reduction of GHG emissions from ships. This paper takes a critical look at the above and other recent developments and focuses on the challenges faced by the industry if a path to significant CO2 reductions is to be successful. Difficulties and opportunities are identified, and the paper conjectures that the main obstacles are neither technical nor economic, but political.

TI  - Future carbon emissions from global mangrove forest loss
JO  - Global Change Biology
PY  - 2021
VL  - 27
IS  - 12
AB  - Mangroves have among the highest carbon densities of any tropical forest. These â€˜blue carbonâ€™ ecosystems can store large amounts of carbon for long periods, and their protection reduces greenhouse gas emissions and supports climate change mitigation. Incorporating mangroves into Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement and their valuation on carbon markets requires predicting how the management of different land-uses can prevent future greenhouse gas emissions and increase CO2 sequestration. We integrated comprehensive global datasets for carbon stocks, mangrove distribution, deforestation rates, and land-use change drivers into a predictive model of mangrove carbon emissions. We project emissions and foregone soil carbon sequestration potential under â€˜business as usualâ€™ rates of mangrove loss. Emissions from mangrove loss could reach 2391Â TgÂ CO2Â eq by the end of the century, or 3392Â TgÂ CO2Â eq when considering foregone soil carbon sequestration. The highest emissions were predicted in southeast and south Asia (West Coral Triangle, Sunda Shelf, and the Bay of Bengal) due to conversion to aquaculture or agriculture, followed by the Caribbean (Tropical Northwest Atlantic) due to clearing and erosion, and the Andaman coast (West Myanmar) and north Brazil due to erosion. Together, these six regions accounted for 90% of the total potential CO2Â eq future emissions. Mangrove loss has been slowing, and global emissions could be more than halved if reduced loss rates remain in the future. Notably, the location of global emission hotspots was consistent with every dataset used to calculate deforestation rates or with alternative assumptions about carbon storage and emissions. Our results indicate the regions in need of policy actions to address emissions arising from mangrove loss and the drivers that could be managed to prevent them. Â© 2021 The Authors.

JO  - Biotechnology For Biofuels
PY  - 2017
VL  - 10
IS  - NA
AB  - Background: Future sustainable energy production can be achieved using mass cultures of photoautotrophic microorganisms, which are engineered to synthesize valuable products directly from CO2 and sunlight. As cyanobacteria can be cultivated in large scale on non-arable land, these phototrophic bacteria have become attractive organisms for production of biofuels. Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, one of the cyanobacterial model organisms, provides many attractive properties for biofuel production such as tolerance of seawater and high light intensities. Results: Here, we performed a systems analysis of an engineered ethanol-producing strain of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, which was grown in artificial seawater medium over 30 days applying a 12: 12 h daynight cycle. Biosynthesis of ethanol resulted in a final accumulation of 0.25\% ( v/v) ethanol, including ethanol lost due to evaporation. The cultivation experiment revealed three production phases. The highest production rate was observed in the initial phase when cells were actively growing. In phase II growth of the producer strain stopped, but ethanol production rate was still high. Phase III was characterized by a decrease of both ethanol production and optical density of the culture. Metabolomics revealed that the carbon drain due to ethanol diffusion from the cell resulted in the expected reduction of pyruvate-based intermediates. Carbon- saving strategies successfully compensated the decrease of central intermediates of carbon metabolism during the first phase of fermentation. However, during longter methanol production the producer strain showed clear indications of intracellular carbon limitation. Despite the decreased levels of glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, soluble sugars and even glycogen accumulated in the producer strain. The changes in carbon assimilation patterns are partly supported by proteome analysis, which detected decreased levels of many enzymes and also revealed the stress phenotype of ethanol-producing cells. Strategies towards improved ethanol production are discussed. Conclusions: Systems analysis of ethanol production in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 revealed initial compensation followed by increasing metabolic limitation due to excessive carbon drain from primary metabolism.

TI  - Reusing O&amp;G depleted reservoirs for CO2 storage: Pros and cons
JO  - Society Of Petroleum Engineers - Offshore Europe Oil And Gas Conference And Exhibition 2009, Oe 2009
PY  - 2009
VL  - 2
IS  - NA
AB  - Two main types of reservoirs are considered for geological storage of CO2: deep saline formations and depleted oil and gas reservoirs. The former offer very large potential capacity and a more even distribution, at the expense of high uncertainty due to the very poor characterization of their properties, including their sealing capacity; the latter offer smaller overall capacity, but with a reduced risk due to better reservoir knowledge. Gas reservoirs have also provided a proven seal to pressurized gas. However, reusing depleted O&amp;G reservoirs presents challenges that must be considered in the evaluation of performance factors and the risks associated Depletion can cause pore collapse in the reservoir - with an associated loss of capacity and injectivity - weaken caprock and bounding faults, or even well completions, leading to possible containment losses due to mechanical failure. O&amp;G reservoirs are also intersected by many wells and it is likely that stricter regulatory requirements on well integrity and the quality of zonal isolation will force operators to recomplete or work over wells which will be exposed to CO2, with an obvious impact on cost. Low reservoir pressure may also mean that injection of CO2 in a dense phase would result in reservoir fracturing and very strong thermal effects that may lead to injectivity problems. In the reservoir, chemical and physical differences in behavior between CO2 and methane may adversely affect geological containment and injectivity. Economics and financing present another set of constraints: use of injected CO2 for EOR/EGR vs. storage may lead to difficulties in obtaining emission credits. Infrastructure decommissioning and conflict with resource exploitation may reduce the attractiveness of depleted reservoirs. The benefits and challenges of depleted O&amp;G reservoirs will be analyzed with respect to all performance factors (capacity, injectivity, containment) and the major drivers of costs and risks will be identified. Fixed costs and risks, associated to uncertain capacity for deep saline formations or uncertain containment for depleted reservoirs, will then be used to compare the two candidates for CO2 geological storage and the paper will propose criteria to aid in the selection of possible storage sites.

AB  - Renewable energy is considered worldwide as a sufficient solution to mitigate climate change. Since the application of a new technology is affected by various factors, it is crucial to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of new technology related to, for example, the environment, economy, and society. Most of the current studies do not focus on the quantifiable measurement of the potential of renewable energy as an alternative to fossil fuel energy, especially in power generation sector. This paper aimed to quantitatively recognise the sustainability of different renewable power sources compared to conventional power sources by using Triple I. The Inclusive Impact Index, Triple I, is a metric developed to assess environmental sustainability and economic feasibility of utilisation technologies to predict their public acceptance. Triple I can be obtained by subtracting biocapacity (BC) and generated benefits (B) from total ecological footprint (EF), ecological risk (ER), human risk (HR), and costs (C) caused by the system. Findings from this paper found that fossil fuel-based power generation was not sustainable due to the significant environmental burden. Apart from tidal energy and large-scale Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) systems, the high cost of power plant installation and operation led to the unsustainability of ocean energy systems. Nuclear, wind, geothermal, hydro, and tidal and OTEC (100 MW) were found sustainable. Copyright Â© 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Climate change refugia in the terrestrial biosphere are areas where species are protected from global environmental change and arise from natural heterogeneity in landscapes and climate. Within the marine realm, ocean acidification, or the global decline in seawater pH, remains a pervasive threat to organisms and ecosystems. Natural variability in seawater carbon dioxide (CO2) chemistry, however, presents an opportunity to identify ocean acidification refugia (OAR) for marine species. Here, we review the literature to examine the impacts of variable CO2 chemistry on biological responses to ocean acidification and develop a framework of definitions and criteria that connects current OAR research to management goals. Under the concept of managing vulnerability, the most likely mechanisms by which OAR can mitigate ocean acidification impacts are by reducing exposure to harmful conditions or enhancing adaptive capacity. While local management options, such as OAR, show some promise, they present unique challenges, and reducing global anthropogenic CO2 emissions must remain a priority.

AB  - The issues relating to the global warming, air pollution, and energy security have been one of the most important public policy issues nowadays and with the increasing global population, food security has also become a major public policy issue. The development of algal biofuels as a third-generation biofuel has been considered as a major solution for these global problems. Although there have been many reviews on the use of the marine algae in energy, medicine, and health care and there been a number of scientometric studies on the algal biofuels, there has not been any study on the citation classics in the algal photosynthesis, biosorption, biotechnology, and biofuels as in other research fields. As North's New Institutional Theory suggests, it is important to have up-to-date information about the current public policy issues to develop a set of viable solutions to satisfy the needs of all the key stakeholders. Therefore, a selected set of citation classics in the algal photosynthesis, biosorption, biotechnology, and biofuels are presented in this chapter to inform the key stakeholders about the use of marine algae for the solution of these problems in the long run complementing a number of recent scientometric studies on the biofuels and global energy research.

AB  - The IMO Maritime Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC) adopted the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), and ship environmental protection, energy conservation and emission reduction have become the focus of development in the shipping field. However, the actual navigation of the ship working conditions and sea conditions are changeable and uncertain, when the power and speed change, its fuel consumption rate SFOC is affected by the amount of fuel injection, ventilation quality, speed, etc., the best fuel consumption rate SFOC precision point in the actual work of the ship diesel engine is difficult to determine, which is the difficulty of achieving ship fuel saving by controlling the best fuel consumption rate of the diesel engine SFOC. Therefore, this paper optimizes the energy efficiency of hybrid small tugboats, and realizes the operation of power generation diesel engines and low-speed hosts in the minimum SFOC range according to the change of ship speed, the charge/discharge of energy storage battery packs controlled by the reserve power of the ship grid, and the PTI/PTO (electric/power generation) mode of the control shaft with motor M/G.

AB  - Limited research examining the optimal power take-off conditions for harnessing marine current energy using vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) has been undertaken to date. The studies that have been conducted have focused on translating cylinder VIV. This paper presents the results of an investigation of the effectiveness of energy extraction from pivoted cylinder systems undergoing vortex induced vibrations. The main goal of the present study was to observe the response of cylinders with a single roll rotational degree of freedom under a range of power take-off (PTO) damping values to determine the optimal power extraction rates achievable. At PTO damping values below optimal, there appears to be little change in the lock-in point and lower response branch amplitude response. This has important consequences for low Reynolds number PTO which is one of the primary advantages in utilising vortex-induced vibration for marine current energy harvesting.

AB  - Ethiopia is well endowed with geothermal resources, and current exploration is believed to have studied only a fraction of the ultimate potential.The potential prospective areas are distributed along the Ethiopian Rift valley system which runs in a northeast direction along the entire length of Ethiopia. To begin to realize this potential, in 1998, the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCO) constructed the Aluto Langano geothermal pilot power plant (8.5 MW gross) consisting of two Ormat generating units, one an OEC (Ormat Energy Converter) and the other a GCCU (Geothermal Combined Cycle Unit consisting of a buck pressure steam turbine exhausting to an OEC bottoming cycle unit) - each designed to have similar power outputs. The power plant operated satisfactorily for a short period of time right after commissioning before a number of problems arose that severely affected its availability and the power output level. Repair and maintenance of the Aluto Langano GCCU has been completed and the unit was put back into normal operation in July 2007. During the original operational period of the pilot plant and after its recent rehabilitation, experience gained in operation and maintenance will ultimately be used to develop and harness the huge geothermal energy reserve exists in the rift valley region of Ethiopia. In the coming five years it is planned to expand the Aluto Langano geothermal field in two phases.

AB  - In the off-shore wind farm, improving the reliability of the power conversion system is totally necessary. Therefore, the grid-integration of multiple off-shore wind power generators connected in series using a three-phase current source PWM inverter is proposed. The power circuit of the proposed topology consists of permanent magnet synchronous generators, 12 pulse diode rectifiers and a current-source PWM inverter. A simple two-dimensional finite-time settling control scheme has been proposed and implemented to achieve the time-optimum response of the grid-connected current source PWM inverter with an LC filter. The time optimum response with the settling time of two sampling periods is derived actually in the lab. From the measurements, sudden changes in the DC-link current will cause the interconnected power system instability especially for weak grid and for assuring the stability of the proposed grid integration system, the change rate of the DC current should be reduced. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method, designed for the current-source type inverter. Â© 2017 IEEE.

AB  - The two main swath mapping sonars in use today are interferometric and beamforming multibeams. Increasing numbers of interferometers are being seen in survey operations worldwide, but in places there is a perception that the data produced can be difficult to handle. Many shallow-survey projects are ideal for interferometry. There are huge efficiency gains in large area surveys in water depths less than 15 meters. Shallow coastal areas, estuarine systems and many offshore wind farms fit this description. An interferometer is just a multi-stave sidescan. It sends out a sidescan ping and detects the returned sound on several sidescan receiver staves. The data sampling is a time series of amplitudes, like a sidescan, but the interferometer also measures the phase of the returning sound. At first glance the interferometer accuracy should depend on the smallest change in range to the seabed that can be measured, and the smallest change in angle of arrival that can be distinguished.

JO  - Journal Of Marine Science And Engineering

AB  - The decarbonisation of waterborne transport is arguably the biggest challenge faced by the maritime industry presently. By 2050, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the shipping industry by 50\% compared to 2008, with a vision to phase out fossil fuels by the end of the century as a matter of urgency. To meet such targets, action must be taken immediately to address the barriers to adopt the various clean shipping options currently at different technological maturity levels. Green hydrogen as an alternative fuel presents an attractive solution to meet future targets from international bodies and is seen as a viable contributor within a future clean shipping vision. The cost of hydrogen fuel-in the short-term at least-is higher compared to conventional fuel; therefore, energy-saving devices (ESDs) for ships are more important than ever, as implementation of rules and regulations restrict the use of fossil fuels while promoting zero-emission technology. However, existing and emerging ESDs in standalone/combination for traditional fossil fuel driven vessels have not been researched to assess their compatibility for hydrogen-powered ships, which present new challenges and considerations within their design and operation. Therefore, this review aims to bridge that gap by firstly identifying the new challenges that a hydrogen-powered propulsion system brings forth and then reviewing the quantitative energy saving capability and qualitive additional benefits of individual existing and emerging ESDs in standalone and combination, with recommendations for the most applicable ESD combinations with hydrogen-powered waterborne transport presented to maximise energy saving and minimise the negative impact on the propulsion system components. In summary, the most compatible combination ESDs for hydrogen will depend largely on factors such as vessel types, routes, propulsion, operation, etc. However, the mitigation of load fluctuations commonly encountered during a vessels operation was viewed to be a primary area of interest as it can have a negative impact on hydrogen propulsion system components such as the fuel cell; therefore, the ESD combination that can maximise energy savings as well as minimise the fluctuating loads experienced would be viewed as the most compatible with hydrogen-powered waterborne transport.

AB  - Wake effects commonly exist in offshore wind farms, which will cause a 10-20\% reduction of whole power production as well as a 5-15\% increase of fatigue loading on the wind turbine main structures. Obviously wake interaction between floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) is more complicated, and needs careful assessment which is a prerequisite for active wake control (AWC). The primary objective of the present research is to investigate in detail how the wake inflow condition, streamwise spacing, turbulence intensity, and wind shear influence the power performance, platform motion dynamic and structural loading of FOWT. FAST.Farm, developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), was used for simulating two tandem FOWTs in different conditions. Comparisons were made between FOWTs in different conditions on power performance and platform motion dynamic, which were presented through both time and frequency domain analysis. Damage equivalent loads change in FOWTs interference under typical working conditions were discussed and summarized. Half wake inflow would pose many challenges to the downstream FOWT. These research studies can be incorporated into further offshore wind farm wake models, providing applicable AWC strategies to reduce wake interference effects for higher energy production and for the longer life of FOWT.

In addition, bioethanol production technology has the capacity for negative carbon emissions, which is vital for solving the current global warming dilemma. However, conventional bioethanol production takes place based on an inland site and relies on freshwater and edible crops (or land suitable for edible crop production) for production, which has led to the food vs. fuel debate. Establishing a coastal marine biorefinery (CMB) system for bioethanol production that is based on coastal sites and relies on marine resources (seawater, marine biomass and marine yeast) could be the ultimate solution. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the environmental impact of using seawater for bioethanol production at coastal locations as a step toward the evaluation of a CMB system. Hence, a life cycle assessment for bioethanol production was conducted using the proposed scenario, named Coastal Seawater, and compared to the conventional scenario, named Inland Freshwater (IF). The impact of each scenario in relation to climate change, water depletion, land use and fossil depletion was studied for comparison. The Coastal Seawater scenario demonstrated an improvement upon the conventional scenario in all the selected impact categories. In particular, the use of seawater in the process had a significant effect on water depletion, showing an impact reduction of 31.2\%. Furthermore, reductions were demonstrated in natural land transformation, climate change and fossil depletion of 5.5\%, 3.5\% and 4.2\%, respectively. This indicates the positive impact of using seawater and coastal locations for bioethanol production and encourages research to investigate the CMB system.

AB  - Nowadays, more than in the past, marine industries are paying increasing attention to the environmental impact of ships and vessels. Several solutions have been studied and adopted with the final aim of reducing the exhaust gas emissions, mainly acting on the fuel consumption reduction. Within this scenario, the aim of this article is to investigate the energy performance and the fuel saving potential when employing a magnetic continuously variable transmission in a marine propulsion system. Such magnetic continuously variable transmission, considered among other possible continuously variable transmission designs since its torque capabilities are perfectly suitable for the application at hand, is employed in order to optimize the overall propulsion efficiency through an appropriate optimal variation of the reduction ratio as a function of the propeller loads. A secondary benefit, although not less important, is that the magnetic continuously variable transmission is an oil-free transmission that consequently offers a lower environmental impact as compared to traditional lubricated gearboxes. Owing to these considerations, in the article, the magnetic continuously variable transmission size is first selected on the basis of a simplified static model of the vessel. Subsequently, a dynamic mathematical model representing the overall drivetrain dynamic of the propulsion plant is developed, with the purpose of simulating the transmission behaviour during fast ship manoeuvres. Then, in order to test the effectiveness of the proposed design, a trawler is selected as a case study. This particular ship type has been chosen as it provides a variegated operative profile in terms of speed and required thrust, thus being a representative case of those ships in which a continuously variable transmission installation could effectively provide practical benefits. A quantitative analysis of the plant efficiency is finally provided and critically discussed. Â© IMechE 2018.

TI  - Jelly biomass sinking speed reveals a fast carbon export mechanism
JO  - Limnology And Oceanography
PY  - 2013

IS  - 3
AB  - Sinking of gelatinous zooplankton biomass is an important component of the biological pump removing carbon from the upper ocean. The export efficiency, e.g., how much biomass reaches the ocean interior sequestering carbon, is poorly known because of the absence of reliable sinking speed data. We measured sinking rates of gelatinous particulate organic matter (jelly-POM) from different species of scyphozoans, ctenophores, thaliaceans, and pteropods, both in the field and in the laboratory in vertical columns filled with seawater using high-quality video. Using these data, we determined taxon-specific jelly-POM export efficiencies using equations that integrate biomass decay rate, seawater temperature, and sinking speed. Two depth scenarios in several environments were considered, with jelly-POM sinking from 200 and 600 m in temperate, tropical, and polar regions. Jelly-POM sank on average between 850 and 1500 m d(-1) (salps: 800-1200 m d(-1); ctenophores: 1200-1500 m d(-1); scyphozoans: 1000-1100 m d(-1); pyrosomes: 1300 m d(-1)). High latitudes represent a fast-sinking and low-remineralization corridor, regardless of species. In tropical and temperate regions, significant decomposition takes place above 1500 m unless jelly-POM sinks below the permanent thermocline. Sinking jelly-POM sequesters carbon to the deep ocean faster than anticipated, and should be incorporated into biogeochemical and modeling studies to provide more realistic quantification of export via the biological carbon pump worldwide.

TI  - A development scenario for mining in the Gorda Ridge area
JO  - Proceedings Of The Annual Offshore Technology Conference
PY  - 1984
VL  - 1984-May
IS  - NA
AB  - The Minerals Management Service is proposing to offer leases for metalliferous sulfide minerals in the area of the Gorda Ridge off northern California and southern Oregon. In order to provide a basis for the assessment of potential environmental impacts resulting from mineral exploration and mining development, a scenario for mining was prepared, based on available data and using reasonable engineering assumptions. It is assumed that if the whole 180,000 km2 area of interest were leased in 10 blocks each of 16.000-19 000 km2 initially for exploration then we might reasonably expect the discovery and development of three deposits each covering an area of about 10 km2, totalling about 0.002% of the original exploration area. Minimum expected production for each mining operation was assumed to be 1.5 million metric tons each year for 20 years, for a total of 90 million metric tons of ore of specific gravity 2.6. The ores are assumed to be metal sulfides occuring as massive compact deposits on the surface, or in shallow stock works which might be buried under a shallow cap of barren sediment or basalt. The range of metal content in the ores might include zinc, 0.1-55 percent, copper 0.3-10 percent, lead 0.1-0.4 percent, silver trace-400 ppm, and gold, a trace. A sulfur byproduct of 10-30 percent is also likely. Mining techniques envisaged would employ a semi-submersible platform at the surface for placement and retrieval of all seabed installations and for buffer storage of the ore, pumped from the bottom at the rate of 5,000 tons per day. Seabed operations might use bucket wheel excavators feeding to a crusher, with primary separation of ore and waste and a vertical two or three phase lift system. Drilling and fracturing of below surface deposits would be needed prior to removal. Up to 20 meters of sediment or 10 meters of rock overburden might be removed. Ore transhipped to land would be concentrated and refined by conventional means. Impacts associated with the mining operations would likely include noise, light, vibrations, turbidity, electrical leakage, seabed contact and loss of lubricants. These impacts would likely be limited to the mining area and some would be accident related only. Â© 1984 Offshore Technology Conference. All rights reserved.

AB  - The current offshore wind power development has the characteristics of large-scale and clustering, and the demand of offshore wind farm cluster integrating into grid is significant. However, existing related researches to electrical system of offshore wind farm were mostly based on single wind farm, in which location of wind turbines are relatively concentrated, and there is a limit on offshore substationâ€™s number. These researches seldom consider the impact of the onshore transmission planning. That may lead to a series of problems such as submarine crowded, waste of sea resources and onshore grid unreasonable expansion. In this paper, based on the design of public station and public grid, 2 kinds of optimization methods of offshore wind farm cluster integration system were put forward and a unified mathematical model was established. Aiming at the existing problems of the traditional clustering method in offshore substationâ€™s locating and sizing, this paper proposed an improved FSDP algorithm. A bi-level programming was put forward, which includes substationâ€™s optimization and grid topology planning. The results show that public grid mode had the best overall economic efficiency, and the public station mode occupied the least sea resources. Â© 2018 Chin. Soc. for Elec. Eng.

PY  - 2017
VL  - 66

AB  - Blue carbon pertains to carbon stock that is stored by marine ecosystems including mangrove forest. Density and blue carbon stock assessment was conducted covering mature Rhizophora stylosa Griff. plantations in Bohol, Philippines. Three stand types were assessed: thinned mature stand (0.34 tree mâ€“2 at 55 years old; 35 ha); non-thinned mature stand (1.2 tree mâ€“2 at 55 years old; 20 ha) and young stand (2.6 tree mâ€“2 at 20 years old; 150 ha). These plantations were initially established with a plant spacing of 0.5 m Ã— 0.5 m. Non-destructive plot sampling technique was used to account biomass and carbon stocks of trees and sediments. Five (5) sample plots measuring 200 m2 were allocated for each stand type. Results showed that the total carbon stock of plantations amassed to 64.5 ktC or 236.6 ktCO2e. More than half (at least 54%) of this stock is imbedded in sediment. Individual accounts showed that carbon stock was largest in non-thinned stand with 435.2 tC haâ€“1, followed by thinned stand (408.5 tC haâ€“1) and young stand (276.8 tC haâ€“1). There was no significant difference between thinned and non-thinned mature stands carbon stocks. Such finding suggested the potential of having thinning intervention. Following the self-thinning rule of 1.1 to 1.3 tree mâ€“2, the local community can harvest as much as 423 trees haâ€“1 yrâ€“1 for 35 years starting at the plantation age of 20 years. Further, the additional carbon stock between the ages 20 to 55 years could reach about 580 tCO2e haâ€“1 with an economic value of USD 2,962 haâ€“1. With this potential benefits, it is recommended that Banacon Island should pursue a carbon offset project for its plantations. Â© 2017 Estonian University of Life Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose Laboratory experiments were conducted to examine the potential for metal (Cu, Ni and Zn) and herbicide (simazine, atrazine and diuron) release from agricultural soil and dredged sediment in managed realignment sites following tidal inundation. Materials and methods Column microcosm and batch sorption experiments were carried out at low (5 practical salinity units, psu) and high (20 psu) salinity to evaluate the changes in the partitioning of metals and herbicides between the soil/sediment and the aqueous phase, and the release of metals and herbicides from soil/sediment to the overlying water column. Results and discussion For both the metals and herbicides, the highest contaminant loads were released from the sediment within the first 24 h of inundation suggesting that any negative impacts to overlying water quality in a managed realignment scheme will be relatively short term following tidal inundation of soil and sediment. The release of metals was found to be dependent on a combination of salinity effects and the strength of binding of the metals to the soil and sediment. In the case of the herbicides, salinity impacted on their release. Particulate organic carbon was found to control the binding and release of the herbicides, highlighting the importance of assessing soil and sediment organic matter content when planning managed realignment sites. Conclusions Our research demonstrates that metals and herbicides may be released from contaminated sediments and agricultural soils during initial periods of flooding by seawater in managed realignment sites.

IS  - NA
AB  - With the increasing growth of the LNG market, using LNG as a fuel becomes more appealing to ship owners and operators. More ships of various types on order-book choose LNG fuelled propulsion systems to replace conventional HFO and marine diesel fuelled system. This study proposes a new waste energy power generation system to recover the exhaust heat of marine engines and use the cryogenic energy from LNG fuel evaporation systems. The system is built on a main cycle, i.e. an Organic Rankine cycle (ORC), with a bottom cycle with the LNG direct expansion process. The selected working fluid operates in the temperature range of -104 to 200?. The operating data from a real LNG fuelled case ship is applied as the input data in the dynamic simulation using the software - Siemens LMS Imagine.Lab AMESim. Multiple working conditions are studied in the simulation in terms of the different fuel consumption levels of the case ship. The simulation of the proposed system shows a significant improvement in thermal efficiency and power production in comparison to the existing waste energy power generation system on board the case ship.

AB  - This study investigates the safety integrity levels for an electric propulsion system based on a molten carbonate fuel cell in a liquefied hydrogen tanker. The electric propulsion system necessitates multiple electronic and electric elements; thus, the functional safety of the system should be considered. Additionally, a maritime fuel cell system is nonconventional propulsion machinery. This system should follow a risk based ship design framework, and IEC 61511 is a suitable standard for evaluating the functional safety of the system. Hazardous operability studies provide basic information for determining the safety integrity. In this work, a safety layer matrix and calibrated risk graph are generated, and a layer of protection analysis is conducted for a molten carbonate fuel cell stack. Eight guidewords are used to describe accidental scenarios and compare the results of the three methods in an unbiased manner. The most severe consequences are fire and explosion caused by overflows or a control failure in the stack, and the safety integrity levels are mutually different.

AB  - Marine bioinvasions are of increasing attention due to their potential of causing ecological and economic loss. The seaweed Gracilaria vermiculophylla has recently invaded the Baltic Sea, where, under certain conditions, it was found to outcompete the native alga Fucus vesiculosus. Parasites of grazers and temperature are among the potential factors which might indirectly modulate the interactions between these co-occurring algae through their single and combined effects on grazing rates. We tested the temperature and parasitism effects on the feeding of the gastropod Littorina littorea on F. vesiculosus vs. G. vermiculophylla. Uninfected and trematode-infected gastropods were exposed to 10, 16, 22, and 28 Â°C for 4 days while fed with either algae. Faeces production was determined as a proxy for grazing rate, and HSP70 expression, glycogen and lipid concentrations were used to assess the gastropod's biochemical condition. Gracilaria vermiculophylla was grazed more than F. vesiculosus. Trematode infection significantly enhanced faeces production, decreased glycogen concentrations, and increased lipid concentrations in the gastropod. Warming significantly affected glycogen and lipid concentrations, with glycogen peaking at 16 Â°C and lipids at 22 Â°C. Although not significant, warming and trematode infection increased HSP70 levels. Increased faeces production in infected snails and higher faeces production by L. littorea fed with G. vermiculophylla compared to those which fed on F. vesiculosus, suggest parasitism as an important indirect modulator of the interaction between these algae. The changes in the gastropod's biochemical condition indicate that thermal stress induced the mobilization of energy reserves, suggesting a possible onset of compensatory metabolism. Finally, glycogen decrease in infected snails compared to uninfected ones might make them more susceptible to thermal stress. Â© 2022

VL  - 112
IS  - 2
AB  - We report on the water column biogeochemistry in adjacent mangrove and seagrass systems in Gazi Bay (Kenya), with a focus on assessing the sources and cycling of organic and inorganic carbon. Mangrove and seagrass-derived material was found to be the dominant organic carbon sources in the water column, and could be distinguished on the basis of their Î´13C signatures and particulate organic carbon:total suspended matter (POC/TSM) ratios. Spatially, a distinct boundary existed whereby the dominance of mangrove-derived material decreased sharply close to the interface between the mangrove forest and the dense seagrass beds. The latter is consistent with the reported export of mangrove-derived material, which is efficiently trapped in the adjacent seagrass beds. There were significant net inputs of POC and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) along the Kidogoweni salinity gradient, for which the Î´13C CPOC signatures were consistent with those of mangroves. DOC was the dominant form of organic carbon in both mangrove and seagrass beds, with DOC/POC ratios typically between 3 and 15. Dynamics of dissolved inorganic carbon in the creeks were strongly influenced by diagenetic C degradation in the intertidal mangrove areas, resulting in significant CO2 emission from the water column to the atmosphere. Although highest partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) values and areal CO2 flux rates were observed in the mangrove creeks, and the water column above the seagrass beds was in some locations a net sink of CO2, most of the ecosystems' emission Of CO2 to the atmosphere occurred in the seagrass beds adjacent to the mangrove forest. The presence of dense seagrass beds thus had a strong effect on the aquatic biogeochemistry, and resulted in trapping and further mineralization of mangrove-derived POC, intense O2 production and CO2 uptake. The adjacent seagrass beds provide a large area with conditions favorable to exchange of CO2 with the atmosphere, thereby limiting export of mangrove-derived organic and inorganic carbon toward the coastal ocean.

TI  - The effects of slow steaming on the environmental performance in liner shipping
JO  - Maritime Policy \& Management
PY  - 2014
VL  - 41
IS  - 2, SI
AB  - The environment issue is one of the significant challenges that the liner shipping industry has to face. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set a goal to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from existing vessels by 20-50\% by 2050 and develop the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) as a measure for energy efficiency. To achieve this goal, IMO has suggested three basic approaches: the enlargement of vessel size, the reduction of voyage speed, and the application of new technologies. In recent times, liners have adopted slow steaming and decelerated the voyage speed to 15-18 knots on major routes. This is because slow steaming is helpful in reducing operating costs and GHG emissions. However, it also creates negative effects that influence the operating costs and the amount of GHG emissions at the same time.This study started with the basic question: Is it true that as voyage speed reduces, the operating costs and CO2 emissions can be reduced at the same time? If this is true, liners will definitely decelerate their voyage speed themselves as much as possible so that they can increase their profits and improve the level of environmental performance. However, if this is not true, then liners will concentrate just on increasing their profits by not considering environmental factors. This led the authors to set out three objectives: (1) to analyze the relationship between voyage speed and the amount of CO2 emissions and to estimate the changes by slow steaming in liner shipping; (2) to analyze the relationship between voyage speed and the operating costs on a loop; and (3) to find the optimal voyage speed as a solution to maximize the reduction of CO2 emissions at the lowest operating cost, thus satisfying the reduction target of IMO.

JO  - Earth And Planetary Science Letters
PY  - 2010
VL  - 293
IS  - 1-2
AB  - The mid-Cretaceous is thought to be a greenhouse world with significantly higher atmospheric pCO(2) and sea-surface temperatures as well as a much flatter latitudinal thermal gradient compared to the present. This time interval was punctuated by the Cenomanian/Turonian Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE-2, similar to 93.5 Myr ago), an episode of global, massive organic carbon burial that likely resulted in a large and abrupt pCO2 decline. However, the climatic consequences of this pCO(2) drop are yet poorly constrained. We determined the first, high-resolution sea-surface temperature (SST) record across OAE-2 from a deep-marine sedimentary sequence at Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1276 in the mid-latitudinal Newfoundland Basin, NW Atlantic. By employing the organic palaeothermometer TEX86, we found that SSTs across the OAE-2 interval were extremely high, but were punctuated by a remarkably large cooling (5-11 degrees C), which is synchronous with the 2.5-5.5 degrees C cooling in SST records from equatorial Atlantic sites, and the ``Plenus Cold Event{''}. Because this global cooling event is concurrent with increased organic carbon burial, it likely acted in response to the associated pCO(2) drop. Our findings imply a substantial increase in the latitudinal SST gradient in the proto-North Atlantic during this period of global cooling and reduced atmospheric pCO(2), suggesting a strong coupling between pCO(2) and latitudinal thermal gradients under greenhouse climate conditions.

AB  - We present a novel methodology for the control of power unit commitment in complex ship energy systems. The usage of this method is demonstrated with a case study, where measured data was used from a cruise ship operating in the Caribbean and the Mediterranean. The shipâ€™s energy system is conceptualized to feature a fuel cell and a battery along standard diesel generating sets for the purpose of reducing local emissions near coasts. The developed method is formulated as a model predictive control (MPC) problem, where a novel 2-stage predictive model is used to predict power demand, and a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is used to solve unit commitment according to the prediction. The performance of the methodology is compared to fully optimal control, which was simulated by optimizing unit commitment for entire measured power demand profiles of trips. As a result, it can be stated that the developed methodology achieves close to optimal unit commitment control for the conceptualized energy system. Furthermore, the predictive model is formulated so that it returns probability estimates of future power demand rather than point estimates. This opens up the possibility for using stochastic or robust optimization methods for unit commitment optimization in future studies. Â© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Sea Ice Suppression of CO2 Outgassing in the West Antarctic Peninsula: Implications For The Evolving Southern Ocean Carbon Sink
JO  - Geophysical Research Letters
PY  - 2021
VL  - 48
IS  - 11
AB  - The Southern Ocean plays an important role in the uptake of atmospheric CO2. In seasonally ice-covered regions, estimates of air-sea exchange remain uncertain in part because of a lack of observations outside the summer season. Here we present new estimates of air-sea CO2 flux in the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) from an autonomous mooring on the continental shelf. In summer, the WAP is a sink for atmospheric CO2 followed by a slow return to atmospheric equilibrium in autumn and winter. Outgassing is almost entirely suppressed by ice cover from June through October, resulting in a modest net annual CO2 sink. Model projections indicate sea ice formation will occur later in the season in the coming decades potentially weakening the net oceanic CO2 sink. Interannual variability in the WAP is significant, highlighting the importance of sustained observations of air-sea exchange in this rapidly changing region of the Southern Ocean. Plain Language Summary The Southern Ocean absorbs a considerable amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and plays an important role in regulating climate on Earth. Ice covered regions of the Southern Ocean are difficult to access and observations are often limited to the ice-free summer season. Here we present new observations over a full 12 month period from a mooring on the continental shelf of the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). The observations indicate that the WAP absorbs carbon dioxide in the summer season, while the presence of sea ice in winter prevents that carbon from being released back to the atmosphere. Over the next few decades less sea ice is expected to form and this may lead to a weakening of the carbon dioxide uptake in the WAP region.

AB  - Tidal current energy is considered as one of the most important topics to be analyzed due to the penetration of renewable energy sources into the grid. The influence of unsteady wave is playing a crucial role on the tidal currents speed forecasting and its extracted power as well as its integration into the grid. The influence is not significant in case of single turbine or ducted tidal turbines. That is particularly important when taking in account the wave effect as a significant factor to predict the potential of tidal energy in various locations and evaluate the power losses due to severe weather condition. In this work we studied the influence of unsteady wave on the tidal current energy in case of two and three tidal turbines. The proposed work is validated by using more than one forecasting model based on ANN as well as making an interface with the Arduino (micro controller) using MATLAB/Simulink to calculate the power loss due to the wave effect during severe weather conditions. Results proves that using the wave height as an input for the forecasting models will improve the forecasted speed. Also, wave height will reduce the extracted output power and increase the power losses especially in case of multi turbines due to the increase of wave height. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Maritime shipping is essential in global trade. The shipping industry uses fossil fuel with significant environmental impact as a result and a transition to renewable fuels may be part of the solution to reduce emissions. A fuel transition needs to be understood at all stages of the supply chain, ranging from feedstock to use in ships' engines. The purpose of this paper is to do a synthesis of literature to provide an overview of main challenges and opportunities along potential supply chains of renewable methanol for maritime shipping, with a focus on bio-methanol. It is shown that renewable methanol is a technically viable option to reduce emissions from shipping and there are no major challenges with potential supply chains. Minor economic barriers that currently exist have the potential to be overcome with strengthening of environmental targets for shipping or if fuel oil prices revert to higher levels as seen previously.

JO  - International Journal Of Hydrogen Energy

VL  - 42
IS  - 17
AB  - An Energy Management System (EMS), based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) ideas, is proposed here to balance the consumption of power by a set of electrolysis units in an offshore platform. In order to produce renewable hydrogen, the power is locally generated by wind turbines and wave energy converters and fully used by the electrolyzers. The energy generated at the platform by wind and wave is balanced by regulating the operating point of each electrolysis unit and its connections or disconnections, using an MPC based on a Mixed-Integer-Quadratic-Programming algorithm. This Predictive Control algorithm makes it possible to take into account predictions of available power and power consumption, to improve the balance and reduce the number of connections and disconnections of the devices. Two case studies are carried out on different installations composed of wave and wind energies feeding a set of alkaline electrolyzers. Validation using measured data at the target location of the platforms shows the adequate operation of the proposed EMS. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Maritime environmental performance indicators for urban waterways in Amsterdam

PY  - 2018
VL  - 232
IS  - 3
AB  - Owing to new regulations starting from 2025, all commercial canal boats have to comply to zero local emission standards in Amsterdam. It is therefore vital that a clear emission indicator is made available for vessels with a varying operational profile, such as canal boats. In this paper, it is argued that current indicators, such as the Energy Efficiency Design Index, are not suitable for these (passenger) vessels. This paper proposes environmental performance indicators that can quantify emissions, (non-dimensional) energy and fuel usage based on an operational profile set in the design phase. This profile includes part load operation and auxiliary consumers and it can compare new designed concepts with current baseline vessels based on the â€˜benefit for societyâ€™ of different vessel types. In the proposed environmental performance indicators, several operational modes can be defined, in contrast with the currently proposed Energy Efficiency Design Index, which is a point index at 75% of installed power. To gauge not only local emissions but also global emissions, the environmental performance indicator methodology is used to determine a minimum efficiency from any power generation method. This minimum efficiency follows from a comparison between baseline vessels and concepts that are more energy efficient and emission friendly. The proposed environmental performance indicators were validated using measurements on typical propulsion configurations of canal boats in Amsterdam. Three full electric concepts were designed and compared with the measured baseline vessels. As full electric concepts do not have local emissions, the method of power generation must satisfy the requirement to have less global emissions than the mechanical baseline. Furthermore, an energy efficiency of at least 33% is calculated from a fossil-fuelled land-based power plant (including transport) to the boundary from quay to boat to be required for newly designed electric concepts to be more energy efficient than the mechanical baseline.

TI  - Optimisation of tidal turbine array layouts whilst limiting their hydro-environmental impact
JO  - Journal Of Ocean Engineering And Marine Energy
PY  - 2019
VL  - 5
IS  - 3
AB  - The economic viability of tidal energy projects will likely require large-scale deployment, with tens, or even hundreds, of turbines positioned in an array. There is limited published research available on the viability of large-scale deployments, which will depend on both the expected energy yield and potential adverse hydro-environmental impacts. This leads to the question of how best to position turbines in large-scale arrays for maximum energy capture with minimal associated hydro-environmental impacts. The primary aim of this research was the further development of an existing two-dimensional tidal flow model for optimising tidal turbine arrays relative to both power output and potential hydro-environmental impacts. Turbine impacts are simulated using a momentum sink approach and an optimisation algorithm was implemented, which determines an optimal array configuration for maximum energy capture, whilst employing spatial and environmental impact constraints. Application of the developed model to an idealised test case demonstrated that a staggered array is optimal, if one considers maximising power capture alone, while a fence layout was optimal, when considering both power output and associated impacts. In both the scenarios, the optimised configurations produced higher efficiencies than symmetrical inline arrays. To demonstrate the model's applicability to a real tidal environment, it was applied to a case study site; the Shannon Estuary, along the West Coast of Ireland. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first automated array optimisation model to incorporate hydro-environmental impact constraints with the aim of determining specific optimised array configurations with quantifiable efficiencies. The approach could be extremely useful for determining the economic viability of proposed arrays, enabling determination of `environmentally acceptable' levels of tidal energy extraction, and thereby allowing the completion of realistic and accurate early stage cost-benefit analyses for tidal energy projects. The model is therefore, potentially, a very valuable tool for tidal energy researchers, developers and planners.

Across the three Chongming islands, there are seven distinct zones, each with different functions, living styles and energy demand patterns - and thus different opportunities for deployment of renewable energy resources. Various biomass resources (from farming, forestry, municipal waste, and so on) and conversion technologies (e.g. gasification, anaerobic digestion) are evaluated and considered alongside wind, solar, tidal and geothermal options. Distributed energy features prominently in the proposed solution as this allows the most efficient use of both electricity and heat, as well as being suited to many renewable energy resources, which are naturally highly distributed. Compared with a conventional approach, the proposed solution offers carbon dioxide savings of 30. Â© 2009 Thomas Telford Ltd.

TI  - Ship transport of CO2: Technical solutions and analysis of costs, energy utilization, exergy efficiency and CO2 emissions
JO  - Chemical Engineering Research And Design
PY  - 2006
VL  - 84
IS  - 9 A
AB  - Increased focus on reducing CO2 emissions has created growing interest in CO2 capturing from industrial processes for storage in geologic formations or injection in oil reservoirs for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Due to the scattered CO2 sources and the uncertainty in the growth of the CO2 market, a cost effective and flexible transport system is required. In this work a ship transport concept is developed as an alternative to pipeline transport. New technical solutions, cost-, energy-, exergy- and CO2 emission analysis for ship-based transport of CO2 are presented. The concept includes all the elements in the transport chain, namely liquefaction, intermediate storage, loading system, semi-pressurized ship and offshore unloading system. Economical large-scale transport Of CO2 by ship could be done in semi-pressurized vessels of around 20 000 m3 at pressures near triple point (6.5 bara and -52Â°C) in order to use well established design for commercial construction of LPG carriers and intermediate storage. This condition also gives the highest density in the liquid state, which reduces the transport unit cost. Liquefaction Of CO2 is best achieved in an open cycle, where the refrigeration is partly or fully provided by the feed gas itself. The offshore unloading system will transport the liquid CO2 from the dedicated CO2 ship to the wellhead on the platform at the required temperature and pressure. During the unloading phase the ship is connected to a submerged turret loading (STL) system. The CO2 is pumped to a pressure high enough to avoid phase transition in the transfer lines. A flexible riser, a subsea pipeline and an insulated pipeline in the platform shaft bring the CO2 from the unloading location to the topside of the platform. The CO2 is pumped to injection pressure and heated to avoid operational problems before it is injected into the reservoir for EOR using conventional water injection wells. The total specific energy requirement for the selected transport chain is 142 kWh tonne-1 C02, where the liquefaction process accounts for 77%. An exergy analysis of the chain is performed showing that the minimum work required in the chain is 60 kWh tonne-1 CO2, giving a chain rational efficiency of 42%. The total CO2 emissions are estimated to be approximately 1.4% of the inlet CO2. The total costs of ship-based transport are calculated to be 20-30 USD tonne-1 for volumes larger than 2 Mt y-1 and distances limited to the North Sea. Ship transport offers a flexible alternative for bringing CO2 to offshore installations. Dedicated CO2 carriers for transport of CO2 directly from the source to the oil fields might be a key element in future CO2 infrastructures. Â© 2006 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - The international maritime transport sector is known as one of the oldest industries in the world. Ships are used for various purposes from transportation to militaryÂ and they areÂ considered vital for global trade since their main use is for the transport of goods around the world. Currently, the international commercial shipping sector is carrying out nearly nine out of ten tons of the global cargo transportation needs. Despite the fact that the effect of shipping emissions to global warming is limited when compared to other modes of transport, greenhouse gas emissions constitute a serious issue for shipping as well. Just as any other product, a ship has a life cycle which is expected to last 20â€“30 years or more. A shipâ€™s life cycle may be divided into four main phases: manufacturing, operation, maintenance and dismantling/recycling. The great portion of emissions occurs during the operational phase due to the propulsion and energy demands of the ship however greenhouse gases are emitted also in other phases of the ship life cycle. In this study, a life cycle concept for ships is comprehensively described and some illustrative emission results are provided in particular for ship greenhouse gas emissions (GHGâ€™s).

AB  - Over the coming decades our society has a significant challenge in achieving globally significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Numerous studies show that large-scale geologic disposal of CO2 from industrial emissions will be essential to achieve this objective. There are currently 21 large-scale CCS facilities in operation. Of these large-scale CCS projects, five use geologic storage in saline formations (Sleipner, SnÃ¸hvit, Quest, IBDP & Gorgon) and together inject nearly 6 million tonnes CO2 per annum (Mtpa). The remaining large-scale projects mainly use CO2EOR as the storage vehicle. Enhanced oil recovery using carbon dioxide (CO2EOR) can have a dual purpose: (a) To recover additional oil, thereby supplying energy and additional revenues; and (b) to mitigate climate change by reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Historically, CO2EOR projects have tended to maximize oil production as a function of the CO2 injected. There are various options proposed to enhance the climate mitigation effect of CO2EOR projects by maximizing the ratio of the CO2 injected to the oil produced, or by transiting projects from CO2EOR in the initial stages to pure storage projects in the later stages. However, to achieve net zero-emissions, CO2EOR projects need to include a significant fraction of non-EOR CO2 storage. CO2EOR projects also play an important role in building the infrastructure needed for large-scale carbon capture, utilisation, and storage. We illustrate these potential pathways using examples of large CCUS/CCS projects, both from offshore Norway and onshore Canada. Â© IOR 2021 - 21st European Symposium on Improved Oil Recovery.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) in coastal wetlands, also known as ``blue C,{''} is an essential component of the global C cycles. To gain a detailed insight into blue C storage and controlling factors, we studied 142 sites across ca. 5000 km of coastal wetlands, covering temperate, subtropical, and tropical climates in China. The wetlands represented six vegetation types (Phragmites australis, mixed of P. australis and Suaeda, single Suaeda, Spartina alterniflora, mangrove {[}Kandelia obovata and Avicennia marina], tidal flat) and three vegetation types invaded by S. alterniflora (P. australis, K. obovata, A. marina). Our results revealed large spatial heterogeneity in SOC density of the top 1-m ranging 40-200 Mg C ha(-1), with higher values in mid-latitude regions (25-30 degrees N) compared with those in both low- (20 degrees N) and high-latitude (38-40 degrees N) regions. Vegetation type influenced SOC density, with P. australis and S. alterniflora having the largest SOC density, followed by mangrove, mixed P. australis and Suaeda, single Suaeda and tidal flat. SOC density increased by 6.25 Mg ha(-1) following S. alterniflora invasion into P. australis community but decreased by 28.56 and 8.17 Mg ha(-1) following invasion into K. obovata and A. marina communities. Based on field measurements and published literature, we calculated a total inventory of 57 x 10(6) Mg C in the top 1-m soil across China's coastal wetlands. Edaphic variables controlled SOC content, with soil chemical properties explaining the largest variance in SOC content. Climate did not control SOC content but had a strong interactive effect with edaphic variables. Plant biomass and quality traits were a minor contributor in regulating SOC content, highlighting the importance of quantity and quality of OC inputs and the balance between production and degradation within the coastal wetlands. These findings provide new insights into blue C stabilization mechanisms and sequestration capacity in coastal wetlands.

PY  - 2014
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Traditionally offshore support vessels have been designed to ensure that they can perform their duties at nearly any sea state. This has been achieved through multiple engines and advanced dynamic positioning systems. This in combination with high safety standards set by the oil companies has resulted in a general operational pattern with vessels running multiple engines at low to medium loads to be prepared for unexpected incidents to happen at any time. At medium to high power the combustion engine produces each kWh with the lowest fuel consumption and the lowest emissions. When engines operate at low power, fuel consumption per kWh produced increases. For the cost of the operation, this increase in specific fuel consumption at lower loads makes a small impact compared to the total cost of the operation, while for emissions low loads implies that emissions of exhaust gases such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and aerosols such as black carbon (BC) increases rapidly due to less favorable combustion conditions. This study investigates potential emission and fuel consumption reductions which can be achieved by introduction of hybrid technologies including their climate mitigation potential. In this context hybrid means engines of different sizes, battery storage of energy to take peak power requirements, and power management systems with a more balanced focus on reducing emissions and energy consumption while maintaining a high safety standard. Our results indicate that hybrid technologies reduce both emissions and fuel consumption and that the climate impact of the emission reduction is much larger than the impact due to the reduction in fuel consumption alone.

AB  - As the Kyoto Protocol, which aims at reducing greenhouse gases in accordance to the UNFCCC, came into force, research on environment friendly energy resources has been a matter of concern worldwide. As a general power generation system, among renewable energy resources, that is interconnected and operated with power system, the wind turbine is emerging as an effective alternative. Since power capacity of the wind turbine has been steadily increasing and its relative importance is also increasing in total facility capacity, we cannot ignore its effect. Because controlling generation output in the wind turbine is not as easy as in the synchronous machine due to its facility characteristics and it generates irregular output fluctuations when interconnected with power system, system interconnection was difficult. But the effect of large capacity wind turbine on isolated power system like Jeju island is serious problem on the frequency stability. Accordingly, it is necessary to analyze the effects of wind turbine on system interconnection and assess the optimum capacity of wind turbine that satisfies the most important principle of stable power supply. This paper have analyzed the effects of wind turbine capacity increases on the system and suggested the method of the capacity to achieve its steady operation. And It is applied to the Jeju island.

AB  - Increasing CO2 emissions will lead to climate change and ocean acidification with severe consequences for ecosystems and for human society. Strategies are being sought to reduce emissions including the geological storage of CO2. Existing studies operate within existing oil and gas regulatory frameworks, but if other non-oil reservoir geological formations are used these existing regulations may not apply. At UK and European levels the potential environmental impacts of uncontrolled CO2 releases from storage sites have been highlighted to be of significance' for regulators. Thus a new regulatory framework may be needed. The precautionary principle is likely to be adopted by regulators, so it is important that the effects of acute and chronic exposures of ecosystems to CO2 leakages are evaluated. Consequently, existing regulations are likely to be developed to include specific recommendations concerning leakages. This review shows that many basic data simply do not exist to assist regulators in this process. Copyright Â© 2005 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - Fuel cells as clean power sources are very attractive for the maritime sector, which is committed to sustainability and reducing greenhouse gas and atmospheric pollutant emissions from ships. This paper presents a technological review on fuel cell power systems for maritime applications from the past two decades. The available fuels including hydrogen, ammonia, renewable methane and methanol for fuel cells under the context of sustainable maritime transportation and their pre-processing technologies are analyzed. Proton exchange membrane, molten carbonate and solid oxide fuel cells are found to be the most promising options for maritime applications, once energy efficiency, power capacity and sensitivity to fuel impurities are considered. The types, layouts and characteristics of fuel cell modules are summarized based on the existing applications in particular industrial or residential sectors. The various research and demonstration projects of fuel cell power systems in the maritime industry are reviewed and the challenges with regard to power capacity, safety, reliability, durability, operability and costs are analyzed. Currently, power capacity, costs and lifetime of the fuel cell stack are the primary barriers. Coupling with batteries, modularization, mass production and optimized operating and control strategies are all important pathways to improve the performance of fuel cell power systems.

TI  - Gas hydrate estimates in muddy sediments from the oxygen isotope of water fraction
JO  - Chemical Geology
PY  - 2017
VL  - 470
IS  - NA
AB  - Gas hydrate in deep-sea sediments is a potential energy resource, and has been the focus of extensive drilling research. However, direct evaluation of the amount of the gas hydrate in marine sediments has been difficult because the gas hydrate in recovered sediment cores is at least partly dissociated due to the drop in pressure and increase in temperature during onboard recovery. In this study, we apply a new method based on oxygen isotopic composition of the H2O fraction of both hydrate and mud sub-samples (Î´18OH and Î´18OM, respectively) in order to evaluate the volume percentage of gas hydrate in core sections collected from the Japan Sea off Joetsu and Oki, which contain different fabrics of the hydrate within hemipelagic mud. We measured isotopic composition of CO2 equilibrated with H2O of the sub-samples of a small size (typically 0.3 cm3) carefully separated from the core sediments and sealed in glass vials. The volume percentage of gas hydrate (H in %) was determined using porosity of the mud sub-samples and oxygen isotopic composition of the bulk pore water (Î´18OPW) squeezed from a certain length of core sediment (typically 20 cm) including dissociated hydrate. 28 out of the 29 examined core sections indicate the relation in the isotopic values of the three components, Î´18OH &gt; Î´18OPW &gt; Î´18OM, as expected from isotopic fractionation that enriches 18O in the hydrate component. Evaluated H-values of the 28 sections ranged from 1.0% to 95.4% and, for most of the section, the H-value was clearly larger than the value estimated by the hydrate distribution on core images. Our new method can, in a simple manner, correct for the underestimation of hydrate amount caused as a result of dissociation during core handling. Our oxygen isotopic data of the hydrate and mud sub-samples fits poorly with the isotopic evolutional curve that assumes Rayleigh fractionation in a closed system. This implies that the pore water isotopic composition may have been homogenized by diffusion and advection of less 18O-depleted pore water from the surrounding sediments. Presence of micro-scale hydrate in the mud matrix was suspected for some sections from the Joetsu site, which present a small difference between Î´18OH and Î´18OM as well as high CH2/CO2 ratios in headspace gas. We suggest that this method, if carried out with careful and quick onboard sampling, is appropriate for the estimation of gas hydrate as an energy resource based on the amount of hydrate present in marine mud.

AB  - Seaweeds are potential sources of high biotechnological interest due to production of a great diversity of compounds exhibiting a broad spectrum of biological activities. On the other hand, there is an urgent need for management options for a sustainable approach to the use of marine organisms as a source of bioactive compounds. This review discusses the bioprospection for bioactive seaweed compounds as pharmaceuticals and antifouling agents, encompassing their potential and possible obstacles and alternatives. In spite of their potential, research on pharmaceuticals and antifouling agents from seaweeds includes mainly the search for molecules that exhibit these biological activities, but lacks of consideration of fundamental and limiting aspects such as the development of alternatives to sustainable supply. However, for the complete development of pharmaceuticals and antifouling compounds in Brazil, marine bioprospection should be more comprehensive, associating the search for molecules with an analysis of their supply. In this way, it is possible to promote sustainable development and conservation of biodiversity, as well as to assert the economic development of Brazil.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 237
IS  - NA
AB  - Salt marshes (a type of coastal wetland with herbaceous plants) are one of the most productive ecosystems. The organic matter accumulated by plants, together with deposition of inorganic mineral sediments, contributes to vertical marsh growth and determines the marsh ability to cope with regional sea level rise. Deposition of mineral sediment, in turn, alters the growth of plant roots and shoots, and further marsh morphology and blue carbon storage. Based on mesocosm experiments simulating the sedimentation intensity, this paper examined the responses of Spartina alterniflora (a plant widely distributed in global salt marshes) to sediment deposition events (0-24 cm thicknesses). The plant height increased by 1.51 cm on average with 1 cm sediment deposition. New roots grew into the deposited sediment layers, resulting in a significant increase in the below-ground biomass. The below-ground biomass doubled with the treatment of 24 cm deposition thickness in comparison with that without deposition. The depth-dependent distribution of below-ground biomass changed from a monotonous (decreasing with soil depth) to a non-monotonic (increasing first and then decreasing) trend. This illustrates the growth of marsh plants in response to sediment deposition disturbance (similar to artificial or storm-induced sediment deposition) and have important implications for further investigations on marsh resiliency, blue carbon storage and marsh morphology.

The total coastal energy demand of load and hydrogen in 2050 is provided based on existing growth rates and future energy substitution trends. An optimization model with the goal of minimizing levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and levelized cost of hydrogen (LOCH) is established to calculate the amount of hydrogen produced by offshore wind power. Finally, the carbon reduction is calculated by substituting hydrogen for traditional energy in the fields of power generation, heat, industry, and transport. The analysis underscores notable benefits of low-carbon system in China and may provide an essential reference for China's carbon neutrality. Â© 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Bureau Veritas (BV) is working on solutions for LNG use as fuel for passenger vessels. BV believes that the marine industry needs to look at new ways of reducing the environmental impact from ships as public opinion becomes ever more focused on green issues. Several new projects are in the pipeline with the goal of an environmental friendly passenger ship, with no marine emissions and very low emissions to air. Engine makers have families of dual-fuel engines that can burn fuel or LNG and BV was the first to class dual fuel vessels. The issues that now need to be resolved are how to apply a technology which works on gas carriers to the more regulated and sensitive area of passenger vessels. There is considerable synergy between these two sectors at extreme ends of the shipping industry, i.e., they share a common concern on energy efficiency and reduction of air emissions. Moreover, there is a market for LNG-fuelled ferries, which can operate on fixed routes. At present, BV considers that there is a lack of global distribution of LNG in ports used by passenger ships, and logistical problems related to bunkering. A further major issue for passenger ships that want to use LNG as a secondary fuel is finding sufficient space onboard suitably located for LNG storage.

JO  - Applied Energy

AB  - Hybrid electric propulsive systems (HEPSs) attract increasing research interest due to their environmental and economic merits. However, the design optimization of HEPSs with the single objective of fuel saving may result in increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and high cost. The present study proposes a multi-objective optimization method to obtain an optimal trade-off with respect to fuel consumption, GHG emission, and lifecycle cost. Due to high convergence in solving constrained multi-objective optimization problems, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-H) is developed to explore an optimal design space. Performance tests are conducted on a real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform. The hybrid diesel/battery/shore power system on an anchor handling tug supply vessel is considered as a study case. The results of the proposed NSGA-II are compared with those from a single-objective optimization pursuing minimum fuel consumption. The proposed method outputs designs that can significantly reduce GHG emission and lifecycle cost by sacrificing low fuel consumption when compared with that of single objective optimization. Furthermore, the HEPS designed by the proposed method exhibits advantages over the conventional propulsive system in terms of all the three aspects.

VL  - 100
IS  - NA
AB  - In order to explore methods of removing CO2 from submersible habitats with sea water, gas scrubbing experiments (using tap water, and tap water with 3.5 wt\% sea salt) were performed in a 108 mm i.d. pilot-scale column, investigating the removal efficiency of CO2 (e.g. at 2 vol\%) from a gaseous stream. The performance of this column fitted with 5 spray nozzles was compared with a column packed with 1/8th in. Dixon rings (packing depth = 1480 mm). More detailed experiments were then performed in the column packed with Dixon rings at: liquid flows from 4 to 8 dm(3) min(-1); gas flows 18 and 36 N dm(3) min(-1), column pressures =1 and 4bar(g); column temperatures approximately 5 and 17 degrees C. In general, CO2 removal increased as column operating pressure was increased, or fluid temperature was decreased. When approaching low gas outlet CO2 levels at the top of the column (e.g. 0.1 vol\%), the concentration of carbonate species in the tap water (fed into the column) restricted further improvements in the performance of the column. In experiments in a short column with Dixon rings (packing depth =180 mm), using fresh water in each column, the performance of a multi-column eight chamber compact scrubber was simulated, and shown to be significantly better than a single tall column.

AB  - Sea shipping is one of the most widespread transport modes. Therefore, the improvement of energy efficiency and further curbing of Carbon Dioxide emissions by marine vessels is important both economically and environmentally. During the sixty ninth Marine Environment Protection Committee session in April 2016, the International Maritime Organization approved mandatory requirements for ships to report their fuel consumption, which is the first of the three-phase approach to derive a standardized measure for energy efficiency tracking of marine vessels. Under the International Maritime Organization Data Collection System, emphasis has been placed on verification of the collected fuel consumption data so that vessels' energy efficiency could be benchmarked and improved. To optimize the operational efficiency of marine vessels, this paper proposes the Real-Time Energy Efficiency Operating Index and the framework to implement it. The proposed scheme can be used to verify fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emission data reported by individual ships. It also provides an approach to automatically and remotely estimate the transport work in real time. The proposed architecture mainly relies on the Automated Identification System and a constructed vessel database. A proof of concept prototype is deployed that monitors the energy efficiency of vessels along the Singapore Strait. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) is a monitoring tool for managing ship and fleet efficiency performance over time. The EEOI enables operators to measure the fuel efficiency of a ship in operation and to gauge the effect of any changes in operation, e.g. improved voyage planning and more frequent propeller cleaning, or the introduction of technical measures such as waste heat recovery systems or a new propeller. The EEDI index implies a minimum acceptable level in terms of ship energy efficiency, quantified by CO 2 emissions and relative to freight and transport distance. Supported values will be reduced depending on the implementation phases. It expects the implementation of this index to drive the deployment of innovative shipboard technologies to influence their energy efficiency. The values of the reduction factors have a decreasing trend during the implementation periods, reaching a minimum of 30% reduction of the pollutant emissions in the years 2025 compared to the levels before the implementation of this index. EEDI has been conceived as the largest and most powerful segments of the maritime industry. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

JO  - Journal Of Cleaner Production
PY  - 2021

IS  - NA
AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause of global warming, and active development of renewable energy has become popular in resource utilization. Wind power, as the second largest renewable energy source, plays an important role in the power industry, and clarifying the carbon footprint and carbon emission intensity of wind farms is the basis for their rational use. Although the study of the carbon footprint of wind farms has attracted considerable attention, the characteristics of the carbon footprint and carbon emission intensity of wind farms in grassland areas compared with other types of wind farms have not been determined to date. As an important part of the world's largest Eurasian grassland, the installed capacity of wind farms in the grasslands of Inner Mongolia ranks first in China. In this study, the carbon footprint of the production, transportation, construction, operation, and disposal stages was evaluated by using the life cycle assessment method in a 49.5 MW wind farm in the Inner Mongolia grassland, and its carbon emission intensity was explored in depth. The results showed the following: (1) The carbon footprint of the wind farm in the grassland area was 18701.29 t, of which the construction stage accounted for the largest proportion at 56.74\%, and the other stages, ranging from highest to lowest, were production, disposal, transportation, and operation stages, which were 28.18\%, 12.08\%, 2.76\%, and 0.24\%, respectively. (2) The carbon footprint of material recycling was 18726.53 t, and the reduced carbon emissions accounted for 50.03\% of the total carbon emissions. (3) The carbon emission intensity of the wind farm was 6.57 g/kWh, which is approximately 148.45 times, 72.91 times, 127.85 times, and 3.50 times less than the carbon emission intensity of the four non-renewable energy sources of coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear power, respectively. (4) Wind power have lower carbon emission intensities than the four renewable energy sources of hydropower, biomass, and photovoltaics. This study highlights the very important role played by system boundaries when employing life cycles to evaluate carbon footprints. Compared with offshore wind farms and non-grassland wind farms, grassland wind farms have the lowest carbon emission intensity. The promotion of wind farms has excellent potential in grassland areas.

Because swath location is not fixed, interpolation was applied to get a fixed grid with 0.1Â° resolution. We calculate and analysis China offshore wind resources effective density of wind energy (EDWE) at 10 meters high above the sea level. And find that EDWE is rich in offshore area. The highest EDWE is in Taiwan Strait and North and South of the strait, with the EDWE 600-800W/m2, the next highest is East China Sea and South China Sea. The lowest EDWE is Yellow Sea and Bohai bay, less than 400W/m2. And several other wind energy resource-rich areas are: 1)the north of Bohai Bay, with wind power density more than 800 w/m*m decline to the south, 2)the East China Sea area the power density above 400 w/m*m increase to the southward. Guangdong coastal waters are rich in wind resources energy. Â© 2008 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.

AB  - Many areas of algae technology have developed over the last decades, and there is an established market for products derived from algae, dominated by health food and aquaculture. In addition, the interest for active biomolecules from algae is increasing rapidly. The need for CO2 management, in particular capture and storage is currently an important technological, economical and global political issue and will continue to be so until alternative energy sources and energy carriers diminish the need for fossil fuels. This review summarizes in an integrated manner different technologies for use of algae, demonstrating the possibility of combining different areas of algae technology to capture CO2 and using the obtained algal biomass for various industrial applications thus bringing added value to the capturing and storage processes. Furthermore, we emphasize the use of algae in a novel biological process which produces H-2 directly from solar energy in contrast to the conventional CO2 neutral biological methods. This biological process is a part of the proposed integrated CO2 management scheme. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper investigates the viability of different fuel cell types in a ship power system, where hydrogen and ammonia are considered as zero-carbon fuels. The identification of alternatives to diesel-powered ships is performed by taking into account the environmental and economic indicators of the considered power systems, determined by Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life-Cycle Cost Assessment (LCCA), and further compared with the existing diesel power systems of three passenger ships operating in Croatian coastal waters. Special attention is paid to fuel origin, where fossil fuels (grey fuel), fossil fuels followed by CO2 capture (blue fuel), and those produced from renewable energy sources (green fuel) are considered. The results of the research indicate that fuel cell systems with grey hydrogen and grey ammonia are not environmentally friendly, while fuel cell systems with the blue and green types of these fuels have a lower impact on the environment than a diesel-powered ship, with a reduction of up to 84% in CO2-eq emissions when green ammonia is used. Regarding profitability, the diesel-powered ship has the lowest total costs, while the second most cost-effective option is the fuel cell system with blue ammonia as fuel with 27%-43% higher costs than a diesel-powered ship, depending on which type of fuel cell is used. Although blue ammonia is a cheaper fuel than diesel fuel, the lifetime costs of the fuel cell power system are affected by relatively high investment costs (fuel cell, battery, cracker, etc.) and equipment replacement costs.

AB  - This paper describes a system for utility-scale offshore energy harvesting and storage where hollow concrete spheres are located on the seafloor and act as moorings for a tension leg platform (or moored structure) to which ocean energy harvesting devices can be attached such as wind turbines and wave energy harvesters. A sphere with an inside diameter of 25 m and a wall thickness of 2.6 m operating at 70% efficiency in 320 m of water can store 5 MWh of energy and would have a mass of 21,000 tonnes and be self-ballasting. To store energy, water is pumped out of the sphere leaving sub-atmosphere pressure inside. To generate power, water flows through a turbine back into the sphere. Tension leg(s) for securing the floating platform would serve as power conduits, guide rails for maintenance ROVs, and could also serve as vent lines. To yield a 4 GW offshore wind farm with integral storage would require the manufacture of about one concrete sphere a day for 5 years, where each sphere would anchor a floating platform that could support a 5MW wind turbine. Levelized cost of energy from the system would range from $0.12-$0.20 /kWh. The cost is greatly affected by production and deployment technology, and this paper will describe methods for large scale manufacturing and deployment of these large spheres, as well as the floating energy harvesting platform.

JO  - Shengtai Xuebao

VL  - 37
IS  - 1
AB  - Methane (CH4) is a major greenhouse gas (CHC), accounting for approximately 17% of global warming, with a relative global warming potential 34 times more powerful than carbon dioxide (CO2) on a mass basis. Wetland systems are considered to be the largest natural source of CH4 emitted to the atmosphere, with CH4 fluxes determined through analysis the balance of CH4 production by methanogens under anoxic conditions, and CH4 oxidation by methanotrophs under aerobic conditions. Human activities, such as fossil-fuel combustion and nitrogen fertilizer application, have resulted in much higher nitrogen and sulfate loads in wetlands. Although estuarine tidal marshes are important contributors to GHG emissions, the relationships between CH4 production, oxidation, and nitrogen and sulfate enrichment have not been thoroughly investigated in these environments. Using laboratory incubation techniques, the short-term effects of nitrogen and sulfate addition on soil CH4 production and oxidation of the tidal Cyperus malaccensis wetlands of the Min River estuary were measured in July 2015, and the soil physical and chemical properties were examined following nitrogen and sulfate treatments. Under anoxic conditions, CH4 production rates in the NH4Cl (N1) and NH4NO3(N3) treatments at different stages increased by 136. 70% and 136.55%, respectively, which were significantly higher than in the control treatment (P &lt;0.05). CH4 production rates in soils under the NH4Cl+K2SO4(NS1) and NH4NO3 +K2SO4(NS1) treatments increased after the 3rd, 6th, 12th, 15th, and 18th days following incubation. However, there were no significant differences in the KNO3(N2), K2SO4(S), and KNO3 +K2SO4(NS2) treatments compared with the control. Under aerobic conditions, CH4 oxidation rates in the N2, N3, NS2, and NS3 treatments increased by 145.30%, 142.93%, 139.48%, and 112.68%,respectively, compared with the control, whereas CH4 oxidation rates in the N1 and S treatments decreased by 16.54% and 20.99%, respectively, compared to the control treatment, although no significant differences were observed across the treatments. During the incubation period, daily CH4 production and oxidation initially increased with incubation time but then decreased in different nitrogen and sulfate treatments, with the magnitudes of both CH4 production and oxidation exhibiting similar temporal patterns across treatments. There were no significant differences in soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), electrical conductivity, and pH among the different treatments (P &lt;0.05) following short-term incubation; however, ammonium nitrogen (NH+4-N) concentrations increased significantly in the N1, N3, NS1, and NS3 treatments (P &lt;0.05); nitrate nitrogen (NO-3-N) concentrations increased significantly in soils under the N2, N3, NS2, and NS3 (P &lt;0.05); and sulfate (SO2-4) concentrations increased significantly in soils under the S, NS1, NS2, and NS3 treatments (P&lt;0.05). Correlation analyses indicated that DOC, NH+4-N, and NO-3-N were the main driving factors influencing the production and oxidation of CH4 in the Min River estuary tidal wetlands.

AB  - Microalgae, the photosynthetic microorganism growing abundantly in marine and aquatic ecosystems, are potential source for biological sequestration of CO2. The carbon uptake differs in the presence of other nutrients, light intensity etc. The biomass yield of Scenedesmus arcuatus var capitatus was studied based on the Face Centred Central Composite design (FCCD) of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) for nitrate, phosphate and carbonate under different conditions (laboratory, room and sunlight conditions). Various pre-treatments (osmotic shock, autoclaving, microwave and ultrasonication) were employed to find the best method for maximum lipid yield. The biomass yield reached a maximum of 1 g/L under sunlight conditions of nitrate concentration 500 ppm and carbonate 2000 ppm. The laboratory conditions resulted in a biomass yield of 0.59 g/L at 500 ppm nitrate, 1000 ppm carbonate and 250 ppm phosphate. Under room conditions, the yield was very low (0.11 g/L). Osmotic shock resulted in higher lipid yield than the other pre-treatment methods. The ability of Scenedesmus arcuatus to uptake high carbon under sunlight conditions and to adapt to high light intensity and fluctuations in light intensity concludes that this species is suitable for large-scale open pond cultivation for CO2 sequestration and production of metabolites.

AB  - Mitigating non-point source nitrogen in coastal estuaries is economically, environmentally, logistically, and socially challenging. On Cape Cod, Massachusetts, nitrogen management includes both traditional, centralized wastewater treatment and sewering as well as a number of alternative technologies. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 37 participants from governmental and non-governmental organizations as well as related industries to identify the barriers and opportunities for the use of alternative technologies to mitigate nitrogen pollution. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and then analyzed using content analysis and rhetorical analysis. Cost and technical capacity to reduce nitrogen were the most discussed considerations. Beyond those, there were a slew of additional considerations that also impacted whether a technology would be installed, permitted, and socially accepted. These included: maintenance and monitoring logistics, comparisons to sewering, co-benefits, risk/uncertainty, community culture, extent of public engagement, permitting/regulatory challenges, and siting considerations. The insights about these additional considerations are valuable for transferring to other coastal areas managing nutrient impairments that may have not yet factored in these considerations when making decisions about how to meet water quality goals.

AB  - Clayey silt reservoirs bearing natural gas hydrates (NGH) are considered to be the hydrate-bearing reservoirs that boast the highest reserves but tend to be the most difficult to exploit. They are proved to be exploitable by the first NGH production test conducted in the South China Sea in 2017. Based on the understanding of the first production test, the China Geological Survey determined the optimal target NGH reservoirs for production test and conducted a detailed assessment, numerical and experimental simulation, and onshore testing of the reservoirs. After that, it conducted the second offshore NGH production test in 1225 m deep Shenhu Area, South China Sea (also referred to as the second production test) from October 2019 to April 2020. During the second production test, a series of technical challenges of drilling horizontal wells in shallow soft strata in deep sea were met, including wellhead stability, directional drilling of a horizontal well, reservoir stimulation and sand control, and accurate depressurization. As a result, 30 days of continuous gas production was achieved, with a cumulative gas production of 86.14 x10(4) m(3). Thus, the average daily gas production is 2.87 x10(4) m(3), which is 5.57 times as much as that obtained in the first production test. Therefore, both the cumulative gas production and the daily gas production were highly improved compared to the first production test. As indicated by the monitoring results of the second production test, there was no anomaly in methane content in the seafloor, seawater, and atmosphere throughout the whole production test. This successful production test further indicates that safe and effective NGH exploitation is feasible in clayey silt NGH reservoirs. The industrialization of hydrates consists of five stages in general, namely theoretical research and simulation experiments, exploratory production test, experimental production test, productive production test, and commercial production. The second production test serves as an important step from the exploratory production test to experimental production test. (C) 2020 China Geology Editorial Office.

AB  - Today, most of the merchant vessels use Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) for propulsion. These heavy oils are cost effective but they produce significant amounts of noxious emissions. In order to respect International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) as fuel for ships becomes an interesting solution as it allows to reduce nitrogen and sulfur oxides emissions. The study of the potentiality of LNG as fuel for ship propulsion is the aim of NGShiP, a research project carried out in Friuli Venezia Giulia - Italy, where the University of Trieste is a partner involved in the development of statistical model for maritime traffic data and process simulation models. In this paper the results of the maritime traffic statistical analysis are presented. In the analysis, the world ships traffic data for the month of May of three different years (2008, 2009, 2010) have been taken into account. The study allows to identify the vessel segments and routes that can benefit most from LNG installation. Results show that RoRo and tankers ships spend most of their sailing time in Emission Control Areas (ECA) and therefore they appear to be the best candidate for LNG installation. On this basis it has been decided to carry out an energy analysis of a tanker ship. Different energy recovery technologies have been considered and analyzed with the aim to improve ship efficiency and reduce environmental impact. Energy analysis results show that the use of LNG as fuel is interesting but important results can be obtained only if a mixture of energy saving/recovering technologies is considered. The analysis shows that an efficiency improvement as high as 15% can be achieved.

AB  - In this paper, the Dead Sea (DS) environment as a carbon dioxide (CO2) potential storage site was investigated. Firstly, the storage capacity of CO2 in ultra-pure and Dead Sea water (DSW) was studied at ambient temperature and pressure. The effect of CO2 pressure on the storage capacity of CO2 in DSW was also studied at different contact times at the ambient temperature. Finally, for comparison purposes, CO2 gas was injected into a solution containing only dissolved calcium ions. Different analytical and instrumental analysis techniques were used to characterize both liquid and solid samples including acid base titration, Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS), X-ray Diffraction analysis (XRD), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Based on the titration method, the storage capacity of CO2 in both pure water and DSW was found to be 1.7 and 1.53 mmol/l, respectively, at ambient temperature (15 Â°C) and ambient pressure. DSW water was found to contain 1.6 Ca wt% and 4.3 wt% Mg based on AAS analysis. The storage capacity of CO2 in DSW increased with the increase of pressure and despite the high content of Ca and Mg in DSW, no precipitation was observed even at a CO2 pressure of 25 bar and 76 h of contact time. When DSW, saturated with CO2, was titrated (using NaOH), precipitates were obtained containing aragonite, brucite and magnesite as identified by XRD, TGA and SEM analysis techniques. The major finding of this work is that DS water is suitable environment to be used to sequester CO2. Â© 2021 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry

TI  - Genetic Algorithm in Tidal Range Schemesâ€™ Optimisation
JO  - Energy
PY  - 2020
VL  - 200
IS  - NA
AB  - Tidal energy has a significant advantage over many other forms of renewable energy because of the predictability of tides. Tidal Range Structures (TRSs) are one of the main forms of tidal renewable energy. Designing the operation of TRSs is one of the challenging aspects in early stages due to the large variety of scenarios. Traditionally this has been done using a grid search. However, grid search can be very elaborate and time consuming during the design of TRSs. This paper proposes a novel and more efficient method to optimise the design of the operation of TRSs by maximising their electricity generation using a Genetic Algorithm. This GA model is coupled with a 0-D model which breaks the tides into small units and considers flexible operation. This approach delivered more than a 10% increase in electricity generation when compared to non-flexible operation, i.e. using fixed heads for all tides, just by optimising the operation. The GA model was able to achieve the same amount of electricity compared to the best grid search method with flexible operation more efficiently, i.e. with about a 50% reduction in simulation time. The feasibility of the elite operational scheme is validated through a developed 2-D model. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - The role of soil as a carbon sink in coastal salt-marsh and agropastoral systems at La Pletera, NE Spain
JO  - Catena
PY  - 2020
VL  - 185
IS  - NA
AB  - To evaluate the potential of natural and modified salt-marsh soils to store organic carbon and their soil properties, we investigated six soil environments located at La Pletera salt-marsh area, NE Spain. Namely, Ruderal (RU), rubbles over marsh for construction purpose, ELY covered by Elymus elymoides (Raf.) meadows, ART under Arthrocnemum fruticosum L., SAL under Salicornia patula Duval Jouve, AGR under Zea mays L., and AME under Medicago sativa L. as artificial meadow. Soils were sampled at three depths (0â€“5, 5â€“20 and 20â€“40 cm). At 0â€“5 cm depth, soil organic carbon (SOC) was higher in ART soil (40.08 g kgâˆ’1) with respect to ELY, AME, AGR, SAL and RU (23.63, 11.45, 5.77, 4.40 and 3.18 g kgâˆ’1 respectively). Glomalin (TGRSP) in ART had the same trend, with 8.88 g kgâˆ’1 decreased by 51%, 77%, 89%, 92% and 94% in ELY, AME, AGR, SAL and RU soil respectively, indicating that in ART recalcitrant organic carbon may prevail. ART and ELY soils had higher SOC and GRSP than AGR and AME soils at 0â€“5 and 5â€“20 cm (on average + 70% and 57%) but SOC values were similar at 20â€“40 cm depth and glomalin was even higher in AGR and AME soils at this depth suggesting migration of stable organic compounds in cultivated soils. The water stable aggregates (WSA) analysed in the 0.25â€“2 mm and 2â€“5.6 mm fractions was also higher in ART and ELY soils (â‰ˆ90%) at 0â€“5 and 5â€“20 cm with respect to the other investigated soils. Higher WSA (fraction 0.25â€“5 mm) was found in AGR and AME soils at 20â€“40 cm corroborating that at higher GRSP corresponds higher aggregation. Potential carbon loss as C-CO2 (Mg haâˆ’1) was evaluated at 0â€“5 cm depth and was much lower in ART soil. Accordingly, C-CO2/SOC ratio assigned to ART soil 1.85% of SOC loss against 8.26%, 11.64%, 18.90%, 20.37% and 22.72% of ELY, AME, RU, SAL and AGR soils respectively, indicating that only ART and ELY soils may exert clear carbon sequestration ability. The soil under annual Salicornia patula Duval Jouve (SAL) showed very low SOC (4.40 g kgâˆ’1) and the highest carbon loss potential (22.72%) due to shortage of organic decaying debris at surface. Also, C-TGRSP resulted higher in ELY and ART soils (2.51 and 1.31 Mg ha-1respectively) and C-TGRSP/SOC ratio demonstrated glomalin carbon enrichment in this order: ART &gt; AME &gt; ELY &gt; AGR &gt; SAL &gt; RU, suggesting that carbon sequestration capacity may be assigned to ART and ELY soils, major carbon sinks in the Pletera salt-marsh area. Conversely, RU, AGR and AME soils, identified as ancient salt-marsh converted into agropastoral systems or altered for tourism purposes showed worse soil properties and higher sensitivity to carbon destabilization. Statistical treatment of data by factor analysis corroborated the obtained results outlining the importance of ART and ELY soils in maintaining best soil properties and the highest carbon storage capacity.

TI  - Energy and Emission Quality Ranking of Newly Produced Low-Sulphur Marine Fuels
JO  - Polish Maritime Research
PY  - 2022
VL  - 29
IS  - 4
AB  - The article describes the methodology of engine tests on new types of low-sulphur marine fuels in laboratory conditions in order to conduct a comprehensive assessment of their suitability for powering full-size marine engines. The innovativeness of the proposed solution consists of adapting the laboratory Diesel Engine Test Bed to carry out experimental tests using residual and alternative fuels so that it is possible to imitate the real operating conditions of the ship engine. The main aim of the research program was to assess the energy efficiency of six different low-sulphur marine fuels and their impact on the chemical emissivity of engine exhaust gases and air pollution with toxic and harmful chemical compounds. In order to achieve the research purpose formulated in this way, it was necessary to: (1) equip the constructed laboratory stand with highly specialised measuring equipment and (2) develop a technology for determining diagnostic parameters representing the basis for developing a ranking of the energy and emission quality of the tested marine fuels according to the proposed physical model. The model distinguishes 10 diagnostic parameters that, after normalisation, form two subsets of evaluation parameters - stimulant and destimulant. Determining their values made it possible to estimate a synthetic variable, according to which all the tested fuels were adjusted in the order from the ``best `` to the ``worst ``, in accordance with the adopted qualitative criteria of such an assessment. The results of the laboratory tests show that among the considered fuels, i.e., MDO, MGO, RMD 80/L, RMD 80/S, RME 180, and RMG 380 type, the best solution is to use MDO distillate fuel to power full-size marine engines. However, taking into account its high purchase price, a rational alternative decision is to choose RMG 380 type residual fuel, which ranks second in the ranking of the functional quality of the tested marine fuels.

TI  - LNG AS SHIP FUEL FOR SOX EMISSION REDUCTION TARGET IN THE SEA OF MARMARA
JO  - Fresenius Environmental Bulletin
PY  - 2016
VL  - 25
IS  - 5
AB  - Maritime transport is the most environmentally friendly type of transport mode. However, ships' exhaust emissions affect negatively and considerably air quality and human health. Since ships release exhaust emissions to air on a large scale, IMO has adopted the Annex VI `prevention of air pollution' from vessels' to the MARPOL73/78 Convention in 1997. This annex put limits on SOx NOx and PM emissions in both worldwide and Emission Control Areas (ECA) {[}1]. Turkey also adopted MARPOL Annex VI, and expected that an ECA will be announced in Turkish territorial waters in near future. Additionally, regulations on ECAs force ship owners or managers to use alternative technologies or fuels in order to reduce ship emissions. In this study, ship emission reduction ways are analysed, especially low sulphur marine gas oil (MGO) and LNG as ship fuels for SECA. Environmentally, two subjects have been discussed which are: total emissions from ships passing through Turkish Straits, and how much emission reduction can be obtained if these ships would use LNG or MGO as fuel. Financially, external costs of ship emissions onto national economy and investment costs for ship owners for new LNG fuelled ships or retrofitting of existing ships have been analysed by using Payback Period and Net Present Value methods.
