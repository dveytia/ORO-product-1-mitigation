AB  - Throughout Chinese existing river-sea-going ships, there are widespread problems such as chaotic ship types, small average tonnage, serious aging of ships, and low energy efficiency. In order to cater to the requirements of ship emission control areas implemented in China on January 1, 2016, research is carried out on optimization of river-sea-going ship type scheme and operation strategy under emission control area. The lowest cost model of single-ship round-trip voyage is constructed and the ship operation strategies under the emission control zone in China are analyzed. Through discussing the effects of different operation strategies on ship speed, cost and emissions, some suggestions are put forward for the operation of existing river-sea-going ships. At the same time, combining the optimization of design speed with the optimization of ship form schemes, a design speed model of river-sea-going liner based on penalty cost is proposed, and a comprehensive evaluation index system of river-sea-going liner form schemes based on technological advancement, environmental protection and economy is constructed. Systematic optimization of river-sea-going ship type scheme provides an effective way for the preliminary design of the river-sea-going ship, in line with the current river-sea-going shipping background of energy saving and emission reduction in China.

TI  - Waste heat recovery steam systems techno-economic and environmental investigation for ocean-going vessels considering actual operating pro files
JO  - Journal Of Cleaner Production

VL  - 267
IS  - NA
AB  - Waste heat recovery steam systems is a proven technology for improving the ship power plant efficiency and reducing the ship environmental footprint, thus their usage can respond to the pressure for decarbonising the shipping operations. This study aims at investigating the techno-economic feasibility of various waste heat recovery steam systems whilst assessing their environmental impact for three ocean-going tanker vessels with their type spanning from Handymax size to very large crude carriers. Thermodynamic modelling of the investigated systems is employed for estimating the systems performance parameters including the generated electric power and fuel savings taking into account the vessels actual operating profiles and typical annual voyages characteristics. The systems net present value and the profitability index indicators are employed for assessing the systems economic feasibility, whereas the systems environmental impact is evaluated by using the achieved annual carbon dioxide emissions reduction. Two different nominal turbo-generator sizes matching the ship main engine full-load and part-load conditions are investigated, whereas a sensitivity analysis on the fuels prices is carried out to identify the marginal fuel price that renders the investment of each investigated system profitable. The derived results demonstrate that the single pressure waste heat recovery system sized for the ship engine part-load operation provides an attractive solution depending on the vessel type considering the technical, economic and environmental parameters. This study results in better insights on the impacts of the investigated energy efficiency improvement technologies for tanker ships, thus it can prove useful support for designing future sustainable ship power plants.

TI  - Salt marsh plants carbon storage in a temperate Atlantic estuary illustrated by a stable isotopic analysis based approach

PY  - 2013
VL  - 32

AB  - The biomasses, carbon standing stocks, and exportations of three saltmarsh species - Scirpus maritimus, Spartina maritima and Zostera noltii - were determined and their isotopic composition analyzed to illustrate their role in carbon storage in a temperate Atlantic estuary (Mondego, Portugal). Biomass values were higher in the warmer seasons than in the cold seasons, with carbon contents following the same trend. Carbon content ranged from 27-39% in S. maritimus and S. maritima to 30-39% for Z. noltii. S. maritimus had the highest carbon production in the aboveground organs and had similar results with S. maritima in the belowground carbon production. These three species together occupied about 50% of the salt marsh area and they stored in 21 months of study 24,000 kg of carbon in their aboveground and belowground organs. Z. noltii presented highest carbon concentration in the sediment and S. maritimus the lowest. Stable carbon isotopic analysis showed that apparently, the sedimentary organic matter is composed by a mix of terrestrial sources, macro and microalgae. Regard the high carbon exportation, S. maritima and Z. noltii are constantly accumulating carbon. The studied species have both a sink and source behaviour simultaneously.

JO  - Nature Geoscience
PY  - NA
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Large amounts of atmospheric carbon can be exported and retained in the deep sea on millennial time scales, buffering global warming. However, while the Barents Sea is one of the most biologically productive areas of the Arctic Ocean, carbon retention times were thought to be short. Here we present observations, complemented by numerical model simulations, that revealed a deep and widespread lateral injection of approximately 2.33 kt C d(-1) from the Barents Sea shelf to some 1,200 m of the Nansen Basin, driven by Barents Sea Bottom Water transport. With increasing distance from the outflow region, the plume expanded and penetrated into even deeper waters and the sediment. The seasonally fluctuating but continuous injection increases the carbon sequestration of the Barents Sea by 1/3 and feeds the deep sea community of the Nansen Basin. Our findings combined with those from other outflow regions of carbon-rich polar dense waters highlight the importance of lateral injection as a global carbon sink. Resolving uncertainties around negative feedbacks of global warming due to sea ice decline will necessitate observation of changes in bottom water formation and biological productivity at a resolution high enough to quantify future deep carbon injection. Accounting for deep, cross-shelf carbon export into the Nansen Basin increases the carbon sequestration of the Barents Sea region of the Arctic Ocean by some 30\%, according to numerical modelling supported by observational data.

AB  - Considering that the maritime industry emits roughly 3% of the global emissions within the outlook to increase in-between 50 and 250 percent by 2050 the forecast of the growth highlights the need to introduce measures against the negative maritime industry impact on the environment in order to comply with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) goal to minimize the total greenhouse gas emission generation at least 50% by 2050 towards Paris climate agreement policy. According to the established standard from the 01st of January 2023 all ships will be required to present their annual operational carbon intensity indicator (CII) and CII rating. The CII rating will be related to the total volume of cargo carried per distance and will classify vessels into categories of efficiency: A, B, C, E, D where category A will represent the most efficient class of vessels. The low class vessels accordingly will be encouraged by authorities to introduce action measures to improve cargo handling efficiency levels therefore the introduced grading will likewise force shipowners to revise technological availability to retrofit vessels into more efficient. LNG fuel serves as a transition fuel due to its beneficial properties for decarbonization and cryogenic carbon capture technologies implementation in marine transport.

TI  - Study of soil physicochemical properties and heavy metals of a mangrove restoration wetland
JO  - Journal Of Cleaner Production
PY  - 2021
VL  - 291
IS  - NA
AB  - To better understand the optimal restoration pattern, this study explored the soil physicochemical properties and distribution characteristics of heavy metals under various planting patterns in the mangrove restoration wetland which in Jinjiang, Fujian Province. Based on 30 soil samples collected from the wetland in April 2019, we thoroughly analyzed the distribution characteristics of soil physicochemical properties (particle size (PS), pH, soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP)) and nine heavy metals elements (Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, As, V, Co) under different planting patterns. Pollution levels were also studied, and heavy metal concentrations in soil were investigated by correlation analysis, with relevant experimental data from April 2016 and April 2017 used in the comparative analysis. The results showed that in the entire study area, the concentrations of SOM, TN and TP in the low-density area were 35.8\%, 18.03\%, and 21.36\% higher than those in the high-density area, respectively. In the plot of ``A K-C, Acanthus ilifolius Kandelia obovate Aegiceras corniculatum{''}, the concentrations of SOM, TN and TP were more easily accumulated. The trend in average concentrations of 9 heavy metals were as follows: Zn V > Pb > Cr > Cu > Ni > As > Co > Cd. The concentration of heavy metals in the soil of the ``A K-C, Acanthus ilifolius Kandelia obovate Aegiceras corniculatum, 0.5 x 0.5 m (II\#3){''} plot was the lowest, and a preliminary conclusion that the II\#3 pattern for the restoration of soil heavy metal has a more significant role. Based on the Geo-accumulation Index (I-geo) and the Potential Ecological Risk Index (E-r(i)), the pollution levels of the 8 elements other than Cd either did not reach high levels or had no pollution. Moreover, pH value was negatively correlated with SOM at 5\% confidence level, and the correlation coefficient was-0.354 (p < 0.05). The TP increased but the TN decreased year by year, and we can thus consider that the wetland soil and the activated sludge have the same nitrification and denitrification, which is worth for further study. With the increase of wetland restoration time, heavy metals were gradually removed; the concentrations of Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, Cd in the fifth year were significantly lower than before, and the pollution levels were also significantly reduced. The research methods and results can provide theoretical and scientific bases for further study of wetland vegetation and can help in choosing feasible restoration methods for further wetland restoration.

AB  - Economical feasibility and potential Of CO2 capture, storage and reuse in Finland was evaluated under the National Programme on Technology and Climate Change (Climtech). In Finland, no suitable geologic formations exist to sequester CO2. The nearest potential CO2 sequestration sites are offshore oil and gas fields in the North Sea and Barents Sea, which would mean a transport of 500 - 1000 km for captured CO2. With current knowledge, capturing CO2 near the storage sites and investing to new cross-border electricity transmission capacity seems the most feasible option for Finland. Storing CO2 as solid mineral carbonate could be an option in the future, since large resources of suitable silicates exist in Finland as natural minerals and as wastes of-mining industry. The reuse potential of captured CO2 is less than 0.5\% of the annual CO2 emissions.

AB  - Carbon capture and storage has become a new mitigation option to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The effects of the CO2-related acidification, associated with unpredictable leaks of CO2 during the operational phases were studied using the Paracentrotus lividus sea urchin-liquid-phase-assays (fertilisation and embryo-larval development tests). Besides to the direct effects of the CO2-associated pH decrease, the possible effects on marine sediment toxicity were studied by exposing the urchin larvae to elutriate of sediments with different metals concentration, which were subjected to various pH treatments. The resulted median toxic effect pH ranged from 6.33 +/- 0.02 and 6.91 +/- 0.01 for the egg fertilisation, and between 6.66 +/- 0.03 and 7.16 +/- 0.01 for the larval development assays. Concentrations of Co, Zn, As, Cu, and Fe were detected in the sediment elutriates. For all the sediment elutriates tested the amount of the dissolved Zn increased in parallel with the pH reductions. Correlated effects of acidification, biological response, and the presence of dissolved metals were observed in this work evidencing that the most important factor controlling the reduction of egg fertilisation and larval development success was the combined effects of the reduction of pH and the presence of the contaminants (mainly Zn, Co, and As).

AB  - The European Green Deal highlights the need for anthropogenic pressure reduction according to the toxic-free environment ambition. Heavy metals are the largest threat to the food sector sustainability while they are easily bioaccumulated by living organisms, especially aquatic species. Cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg) introduced to the food chain were proven to have a toxic impact on human health causing serious diseases such as Parkinson's disease, kidney and heart failure, osteoporosis, etc. Lead(Pb) can be accumulated by humans from contaminated plants and water resulting in mental retardation and birth defects. The study analyzes the sources of the above heavy metals pollution in the Polish coastal zone of the Baltic Sea which is the main fishing area for the fishing industry in Poland. Available data on the atmospheric deposition and riverine loads of Cd, Pb, Hg were analyzed to present the current trends of heavy metals contamination in 3 basins located in the Polish coastal zone: Bornholm Basin (BB), Eastern Gotland Basin (EGB) and Gdansk Basin (GB). The results show that in the BB and EGB the limits for all 3 heavy metals were exceeded even by 139.58\% in terms of Cd in 2018 in both basins. Pb limit was exceeded in 2018 by 84.62\% in BB and by 123.08\% in 2017 in EGB. On the contrary, values below the limit for Cd and Hg were observed in GB during the entire monitoring period, while the limit for Pb was only temporarily exceeded.

AB  - The government of China has committed to bring carbon dioxide emissions to a peak before 2030 and to achieve carbon neutral before 2060 to tackle climate change. Renewable energy plays a key role in the energy strategy of China in order to achieve the targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring energy security. China has abundant offshore wind resource, distributed along its 18,000 km long coastline and 6000 islands. The first offshore wind farm of China was built in 2008 and put into operation in 2010. It provided green energy for 2010 Shanghai World Expo and then launched an era of offshore wind power development in the coastal areas adjacent to highly populated regions. Over the last decades, many thousands wind turbines have been installed, with an accumulated installed capacity of over 13 GW. This paper reviews the development of offshore wind power and foundation technology used for offshore wind turbines in China using published information, data, and web sources. An ongoing offshore wind farm project is taken as an example to describe the foundation technologies involved. Â© 2022 The Authors

JO  - Transportation Research Record
PY  - 2014
VL  - 2426
IS  - NA
AB  - Maritime shipping is highly fuel-efficient, but its sheer volume and rapid growth make it a major source of carbon emissions. Industry and governments seek to reduce the energy use and carbon footprint of shipping. Yet the reasons for the variation in shipping efficiency observed in the world fleet's embrace of best technical and operational practices to increase efficiency remain unexplained. The research reported in this paper offers a novel analysis that connected 2011 in-use fleet characteristics, first-ever global satellite data on ship movement, and technical literature on ship efficiency technology to assess the long-term prospects of increased shipping efficiency. This study also investigated how each ship characteristic influenced the efficiency of the shipping fleet. A ship stock turnover model was developed to track technical and operational efficiency practices in ships independently. The findings indicated that industry-leading ships were about twice as efficient as industry laggards across major ship types. If the available technical and in-use practices of the low-carbon industry leaders of today were fully embraced, the potential would exist to reduce carbon dioxide in absolute terms by more than 300 million metric tonnes by 2040, even while business-as-usual freight movement doubled. On the basis of the data in this assessment, the potential exists to develop a tool for shippers to quantify, evaluate, and compare their supply chain carbon footprints in a manner that does not rely on more aggregated fleet-average simplifications. The methodology, data, and findings of this study should benefit industry as it looks for ways to reduce energy consumption; researchers, who are examining ship operation; and policy makers, who want to curb the climate impact of international shipping.

AB  - This paper proposes a control algorithm for permanent magnet synchronous generator with a back-to-back three-level neutral-point clamped voltage source converter in a medium-voltage offshore wind power system under unbalanced grid conditions. The proposed control algorithm particularly compensates for the unbalanced grid voltage at the point of common coupling in a collector bus of offshore wind power system. This control algorithm has been formulated based on the symmetrical components in positive and negative rotating synchronous reference frames under generalized unbalanced operating conditions. Negative sequential component of ac input current is injected to the point of common coupling in the proposed control strategy. The amplitude of negative sequential component is calculated to minimize the negative sequential component of grid voltage at PCC under the limitation of current capability in a voltage source converter. The proposed control algorithm makes it possible to provide a balanced voltage at the point of common coupling resulting in the generated power of high quality from offshore wind power system under unbalanced network conditions.

AB  - Carbon dioxide emissions are the main cause of global warming, rise in sea level and ocean acidification. Currently, post-combustion CO2 capture is the most matured technology that is employed by most of the industries. This paper investigated the ways to enhance the CO2 capture ability of the ILs. For this purpose, two ionic liquids 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidiazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Bmim]+[BF4]âˆ’) and 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidiazolium hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim]+[PF6]âˆ’) were selected and compared with conventional amine (MEA and MDEA) solvents. Experimental results showed that conventional amines have larger CO2 loadings as compared to both the ILs because of the reactive nature of amines with CO2. Therefore, it was proposed to prepare the blends of IL-Amine to exploit the reactive nature of amine combined with non-volatile nature of the ILs. It was observed that the [Bmim]+[BF4]âˆ’ blends with amine, have high CO2 loading as compared to pure IL as well as aqueous amine solution. Further, it was found that maximum CO2 loading results for 80% [Bmim]+[BF4]âˆ’-20% MEA blend. Piperazine (PZ) was further added to the blend as the promoter and it significantly enhanced the CO2 loading. Finally, the kinetic studies of various blends were performed and the kinetic parameters were evaluated. Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ship hybridization has received some interests recently in order to achieve the emission target by 2050. However, designing and optimizing a hybrid propulsion system is a complicated problem. Sizing components and optimizing energy management control are coupled with each other. This paper applies a nested double-layer optimization architecture to optimize the sizing and energy management of a hybrid offshore support vessel. Three different power sources, namely diesel engines, batteries and fuel cells, are considered which increases the complexity of the optimization problem. The optimal sizing of the components and their corresponding energy management strategies are illustrated. The effects of the operational profiles and the emission reduction targets on the hybridization design are studied for this particular type of vessel. The results prove that a small emission reduction target of about 10\% can be achieved by improving the diesel engine efficiency using the batteries only while the achievement of a larger emission reduction target mainly depends on the amount of the hydrogen and/or on-shore charging electricity consumed. Some design guidelines for hybridization are derived for this particular ship which could be also valid for other vessels with similar operational profiles.

JO  - Estuarine Coastal And Shelf Science
PY  - 2021
VL  - 259
IS  - NA
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems have the potential to store large amounts of carbon but detailed studies on the fine scale spatial variability of biomass components and sediment organic carbon (SOC) and their relationships are lacking. Here we investigated the fine-scale spatial variation of SOC, aboveground and belowground biomass using systematic grid sampling in a temperate Avicennia marina ((Forssk.) Vierh) forest in Australia. We estimated aboveground biomass in a 9 x 9 sampling grid within a 0.16 ha plot and measured SOC, fine root biomass and necromass down to 1 m at 81 sampling points in an A. marina forest in Western Port Bay near Melbourne, Australia. We detected large differences in all measured carbon pools. SOC increased from low to high intertidal position but showed no consistent trend with depth. Aboveground biomass carbon was highly variable (mean 84 +/- 56 Mg C ha(-1)), and showed no consistent trends with intertidal position. The average total organic carbon stock at the study site was 207 +/- 80 Mg C ha(-1). Aboveground biomass contributed 41\% and coarse roots around 6\% to the total carbon content of the forest. The bulk of organic carbon in the ecosystem was SOC (53\%) and necromass was an important contributor to SOC. Aboveground biomass was a poor predictor of all belowground carbon pools. Our data indicate that 43 sediment cores would be required to determine mean SOC content at the level required by international carbon accounting standards. The high spatial variability of all carbon stocks in the system indicates that current sampling strategies for SOC need to be revised in order to improve predictions of the amount of carbon stored in blue carbon ecosystems.

JO  - Forest Ecology And Management
PY  - 2019
VL  - 444
IS  - NA
AB  - Mangroves often allocate a relatively large proportion of their total biomass production to their roots, and the belowground biomass of these forests contributes towards globally significant carbon sinks. However, little information is available on root production in mangroves due to the difficulties in carrying out measurements of belowground processes, particularly if there is regular flooding. In this study, we examined fine and coarse root production in the east coast of the Malaysian Peninsula. Ingrowth cores were used over the course of 17 months. In September 2014, twenty cores were randomly placed in each of five plots. Three cores were collected from each plot (fifteen cores in total), once every three months. Each core was divided into five 10 cm layers and root dry mass was recorded. Standing root biomass was also measured at the time of final collection using an additional 15 cores. There was a seasonal pattern in root production, which peaked in March and December 2015, after and during the monsoon season. Root biomass in the cores peaked at 33.23 Â± 6.3 t haâˆ’1 and 21.46 Â± 7.3 t haâˆ’1 in March and December respectively. Standing root biomass in February 2016 in the forest was 20.81 Â± 2.8 t haâˆ’1. After 17 months, the final root biomass in the cores was 14% less than the standing root biomass. These data suggest surprisingly rapid growth rates and turnover for mangrove roots. Total root biomass significantly increased with root depth and 78% of the roots, in all soil layers, consisted of fine roots (&lt;3 mm diameter).

AB  - Estuarine and shallow coastal systems (ESCS) are recognized as not only significant organic carbon reservoirs but also emitters of CO2 to the atmosphere through airâ€“sea CO2 gas exchange, thus posing a dilemma on ESCSâ€™s role in climate change mitigation measures. However, some studies have shown that coastal waters take up atmospheric CO2 (Catm), although the magnitude and determinants remain unclear. We argue that the phenomenon of net uptake of Catm by ESCS is not unusual under a given set of terrestrial inputs and geophysical conditions. We assessed the key properties of systems that show the net Catm uptake and found that they are often characteristic of human-dominated systems: (1) input of high terrestrial nutrients, (2) input of treated wastewater in which labile carbon is highly removed, and (3) presence of hypoxia. We propose that human-dominated ESCS are worthy of investigation as a contributor to climate change mitigation. Â© 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - Composite materials have great advantages in their mechanical properties while being lightweight, and are widely used in various fields, especially in aerospace, automotive and medical sectors. However, the uncontrollability and difficulty in prediction of damage propagation has limited its application circumstances. Early damage detection through in situ monitoring from integrated wireless sensors is regarded as an effective solution. Therefore, energy harvesting from the vibration of wind turbine blade can be a key enabling technology to power the wireless sensors for in situ damage monitoring under complex application circumstance, where conventional power supply is not feasible due to the bulky alterations to the blade structural profile. This paper investigates the integration of macro-fibre composite (MFC) onto glass fibre composite wind turbine and explores the capacity of power generation based on ambient vibration, in order to equip the blades with piezoelectric vibration energy harvesting (PVEH) to power associated structure health monitoring (SHM) functionalitics in future studies.

TI  - Reduction of particulate matter and gaseous emission from marine diesel engines using a catalyzed particulate filter
JO  - Ocean Engineering
PY  - 2002
VL  - 29
IS  - 11
AB  - Diesel engines are used widely as the power sources of coastal ships and international vessels primarily due to their high thermal efficiency, high fuel economy and durable performance. However, the gaseous and solid substances exhausted from diesel engines during the combustion process cause air pollution, in particular around harbor regions. In order to effectively reduce particulate matter and gaseous pollution emissions, a catalyzed particulate filter was equipped in the tail pipe of a marine diesel engine. The engine's performance and emission characteristics under various engine speeds and torques were measured using a computerized engine data control and acquisition system accompanied with an engine dynamometer. The effectiveness of installing a catalyzed particulate filter on the reduction of pollutant emissions was examined. The experimental results show that the exhaust gas temperature, carbon monoxide and smoke opacity were reduced significantly upon installation of the particulate filter. In particular, larger conversion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide - and thus larger CO2 and lower CO emissions - were observed for the marine diesel engine equipped with a catalyzed particulate filter and operated at higher engine speeds. This is presumably due to enhancement of the catalytic oxidation reaction that results from an exhaust gas with stronger stirring motion passing through the filter. The absorption of partial heating energy from the exhaust gas by the-physical structure of the particulate filter resulted in a reduction in the exhaust gas temperature. The particulate matter could be burnt to a greater extent due to the effect of the catalyst coated on the surface of the particulate filter. Moreover, the fuel consumption rate was increased slightly while the excess oxygen emission was somewhat decreased with the particulate filter. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Biodiesel as alternative fuel for marine diesel engine applications: A review
JO  - Renewable And Sustainable Energy Reviews
PY  - 2018
VL  - 94
IS  - NA
AB  - Transportation and shipping activities are major contributor to air pollution at sea where most of it occurs as a result of exhaust emissions from ships. Stringent emission limitations enforced by the International Maritime Organization have hastened the need to find a new alternative fuel for marine diesel engines. Thus, biodiesel fuel was chosen as one of the environmentally friendly alternative energy that can reduce ship toxic gas emissions and at the same time reduces dependence on petroleum-based fuels. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of biodiesel as an alternative fuel for marine diesel engine applications. This review covers the biodiesel fuel background, engine performance, history, recent progress, engine warranty, issues, challenges, and possible solutions on using biodiesel for marine applications. A significant number of literatures from indexed journals were cited accordingly. The results of previous studies had shown that the use of biodiesel would mostly increase the amount of brake specific fuel consumption and nitrogen oxide gas while conversely reducing other toxic gas emissions. Although a number of issues and challenges arise, most marine engine manufacturers give conditional warranty against the use of biodiesel in the engines. The study concluded that biodiesel and its blends have a bright future in the marine sector, provided some of the highlighted issues can be solved. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We are all familiar with the episodes in the deep time history of Earth that enabled life to emerge in such abundance. Episodes like the formation of a Moon large enough and near enough to cause tides in the Earth's waters and rocks, a core of sufficient iron with sufficient angular momentum to generate a protective magnetosphere around Earth, and assumption of a planetary axis angle that generates the ecological variation of our seasonal cycles. The living things that did arise on this planet have been modifying their habitats on Earth since they first appeared. Modifications that include the greening of Earth by photosynthetic organisms, which turned a predominantly reducing atmosphere into an oxidising one, the consequent precipitation of iron oxides into iron ore strata, and the formation of huge deposits of limestone by calcifying organisms. The episodes on which we wish to concentrate are 1) the frequent involvement of marine calcifiers (coccolithophores, foraminifera, molluscs, crustacea, corals, echinoderms), that have been described as ecosystem engineers modifying habitats in a generally positive way for other organisms, and 2) the frequent involvement of humans in changing the Earth's biosphere in a generally negative way for other organisms. The fossil record shows that ancestral marine calcifiers had the physiology to cope with both acidified oceans and great excesses of atmospheric CO2 periodically throughout the past 500 million years, creating vast remains of shells as limestone strata in the process. So, our core belief is that humankind must look to the oceans for a solution to present-day climate change. The marine calcifiers of this planet have a track record of decisively modifying both oceans and atmospheres but take millions of years to do it. On the other hand, humanity works fast; in just a few thousand years we have driven scores of animals and plants to extinction, and in just a few hundred years we have so drastically modified our atmosphere that, arguably, we stand on the verge of extinction ourselves. Of all Earth's ecosystems, those built around biological calcifiers, which all convert organic carbon into inorganic limestone, are the only ones that offer the prospect of permanent net removal of CO2 from our atmosphere. These are the carbon-removal biotechnologies we should be seeking to exploit.

AB  - The 2050 target of the European Union to decarbonize the economy by 80-90\% will undoubtedly see marine renewable energies playing a key role. The deployment of offshore facilities within the framework of Blue Growth creates tension as competition for other uses of the sea intensifies as economic exploitation of marine resources increases. Marine spatial planning (MSP) is being applied in different Member States, mainly in the North Sea basin, as a way of easing tensions while promoting blue energy. The southernmost marine areas of the continent also have considerable energy potential that, as yet, has not been exploited due to the limitations imposed by a narrow and steep continental shelf, not to mention legal and administrative barriers. MSP processes currently being developed by the application of Directive 2014/89/EU present an opportunity to resolve these conflicts and promote sustainable use of MRE sources in southern Europe. This paper analyzes the marine spatial planning process of five southern European countries - Spain, Greece, Italy, Malta and Portugal - with the aim of determining the degree to which they are incorporating blue energy policies.

JO  - Dynamic Sedimentary Environments Of Mangrove Coasts

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - The high carbon (C) sequestration and storage capacity of mangroves place these ecosystems in the center of the scientific community interests. As a result, publication of articles on mangrove C stocks has escalated over the last decade. Few among these publications have attempted to deliver global C stocks in mangroves. Despite methodological intricacies, these global assessments converge in being constrained by the data availability and quality. Recent global analyses have highlighted that about 50% of the countries where mangroves thrive lack data on C stored in both biomass and soils. For below-ground biomass (roots), the number of reliable estimates is even more limited. These issues with data availability and quality pose challenges to coastal wetlands scientists to account for the spatial variability of blue C stocks in mangroves, particularly when using predictive models based on environmental correlates. We collated extensive data sets on mangrove biomass and soil organic C and used a worldwide classification of coastline typologies to rank mangroves into distinct types of coastal environmental settings, including river-dominated (large river and small deltas), tidal systems, lagoons, carbonate, and arheic settings. We examined trends in mangrove C storage and sequestration rates across biogeographic provinces and show how the coastal environmental setting framework can improve global estimates. Finally, we deliver a biogeographic perspective on gaps and opportunities that we hope assist coastal wetlands scientists defining research strategies to address current challenges in mangrove blue C macroecology.

JO  - Energy, Environment, And Sustainability
PY  - 2021
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Maritime transportation is the most important transportation type since 90% of world trade is carried. There are 96,295 ships in operation all over the world, and more than 300Â million tons of fuel is consumed annually. A significant amount of emissions are emitted when ships are in operation. There are strict emission rules and regulations that are entered into force by the International Maritime Organization. To reduce shipping emissions and comply with the emission rules and regulations, there are various technologies and methods, including engine modifications, after-treatment systems, and alternative fuels. In todayâ€™s maritime transportation, the use of alternative fuels on ships increases its popularity. Methanol is one of the promising alternative fuels for future maritime transportation. Although methanol-fueled ships are low in number now, methanol has the potential to increase in usage on ships in the future. There is a scant amount of study and a lack of knowledge about methanol usage on marine diesel engines since it is the new fuel for maritime transportation. The methanol combustion at marine diesel engines is needed to be discussed because it is a unique fuel that can provide high engine efficiency and low emissions than diesel fuel. This chapter covers information about the status of maritime transportation, international maritime emission rules and regulations, emission mitigation technologies and methods, methanol at maritime transportation, methanol properties, and combustion concepts, and the methanol partially premixed combustion strategy for maritime transportation. Lastly, the summary section comprises the chapter results. One of the main findings of the chapter is using methanol as an alternative fuel can reduce the different types of regulated emissions at maritime transportation at once without applying additional equipment while providing more efficient marine diesel engines. Another finding is the methanol partially premixed combustion (PPC) strategy showed high engine efficiency than the conventional marine gas oil-fueled diesel engine with lower CO2 and NOX emissions. The sulfur-free structure of methanol does not emit SOX emissions and the low-carbon chain structure of the methanol molecule extremely decreases PM emission formation. This chapter confirms that the methanol PPC can be a solution for marine engines to comply with emission regulations and more efficient engine operation from low load to high load.

JO  - Chemical Engineering Journal
PY  - 2022
VL  - 433
IS  - NA
AB  - Desalination is one of the most effective methods of supplying industrial water. Desalination has evolved into a feasible water supply alternative that allows the use of ocean water, and desalination plants operate in many countries, including in arid areas. Therefore, a large amount of desalination wastewater is generated, which is discharged into the sea. Since highly concentrated mineral ions in desalination wastewater are useful substitutes for carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulfur oxide (SOx) utilization compared with limited feedstock, such as high-grade limestone, it is crucial to improve the utilization of metal ions by recovering desalination wastewater. This study presents a novel process of desalination wastewater recovery CO2 and SOx utilization. The proposed process model comprises the following four systems based on validated experimental data: electrolysis, metal ion separation, SOx capture and utilization (SCU), and CO2 capture and utilization (CCU). First, desalination wastewater was electrolyzed to obtain a strong basic solution through electrolysis. Second, during metal ion separation, magnesium and calcium ions in the wastewater were precipitated in the form of a metal hydroxide and separated by the basic solution. Third, the separated Ca(OH)2 was used for desulfurization and produced gypsum in the SCU system. Finally, CO2 in the desulfurized flue gas was captured by the strong basic solution and utilized as CaCO3 and MgCO3 in the CCU procedures. Consequently, about 91% CO2 is captured and utilized from flue gas, and the desulfurization efficiency is 99%. In addition, the maximum net profit of the proposed process is $ 73.23 per tonne of CO2, and it is profitable and suitable for large-capacity processes, compared with other alternative CCU processes.

JO  - Proceedings Of The Asme Design Engineering Technical Conference

IS  - NA
AB  - In recent years, projects have been proposed to utilize salt caverns as a storage method for supercritical CO2 (s-CO2) and have been carried out around the world, which can effectively reduce the anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG) concentration. Careful and rational design of the salt cavern are required to guarantee the structural stability and reliability of the cavern when in service. In this study, physics-based FE models were first developed to simulate the salt cavern construction process and predict the creep deformation of the cavern wall during s-CO2 storage. In addition, Gaussian process (GP) based surrogate models were constructed from FE simulation results to estimate the properties of salt caverns with cheaper calculations. Then, to obtain a reliable and robust design, an RBDO framework was employed with the assistance of an adaptive fidelity enhancement technique to scan through the high-dimensional design space, which provides a swift and efficient search for the optimal conditions while considering the uncertainties in the salt cavern construction process. This research is one of the first to account for uncertainties within the salt cavern design process, and the results show that uncertainties of variables can strongly affect the system reliability and the volume of the salt cavern.

TI  - Above- and belowground tree biomass models for three mangrove species in Tanzania: a nonlinear mixed effects modelling approach
JO  - Annals Of Forest Science
PY  - 2016
VL  - 73
IS  - 2
AB  - Tested on data from Tanzania, both existing species-specific and common biomass models developed elsewhere revealed statistically significant large prediction errors. Species-specific and common above- and belowground biomass models for three mangrove species were therefore developed. The species-specific models fitted better to data than the common models. The former models are recommended for accurate estimation of biomass stored in mangrove forests of Tanzania. Mangroves are essential for climate change mitigation through carbon storage and sequestration. Biomass models are important tools for quantifying biomass and carbon stock. While numerous aboveground biomass models exist, very few studies have focused on belowground biomass, and among these, mangroves of Africa are hardly or not represented. The aims of the study were to develop above- and belowground biomass models and to evaluate the predictive accuracy of existing aboveground biomass models developed for mangroves in other regions and neighboring countries when applied on data from Tanzania. Data was collected through destructive sampling of 120 trees (aboveground biomass), among these 30 trees were sampled for belowground biomass. The data originated from four sites along the Tanzanian coastline covering three dominant species: Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh, Sonneratia alba J. Smith, and Rhizophora mucronata Lam. The biomass models were developed through mixed modelling leading to fixed effects/common models and random effects/species-specific models. Both the above- and belowground biomass models improved when random effects (species) were considered. Inclusion of total tree height as predictor variable, in addition to diameter at breast height alone, further improved the model predictive accuracy. The tests of existing models from other regions on our data generally showed large and significant prediction errors for aboveground tree biomass. Inclusion of random effects resulted into improved goodness of fit for both above- and belowground biomass models. Species-specific models therefore are recommended for accurate biomass estimation of mangrove forests in Tanzania for both management and ecological applications. For belowground biomass (S. alba) however, the fixed effects/common model is recommended.

AB  - In this paper, we will investigate social factors that indirectly affect ship energy efficiency, intended or not. These include fleet management, charter party agreements, piracy, regulatory factors such as Emission Control Areas, port congestion and port awareness, economic factors such as cost of fuel and charter rates, and human factors (safety, comfort, attitude, and education). I call them â€œsocial factorsâ€ because they all have the characteristic of being created by our society, rather than being driven by the laws of physics. In comparison, physical factors include such things as hull and propeller design and condition, draft and trim, speed through water, engine state of tune, weather effects such as waves, wind and storms, ocean currents, and fuel quality. While optimizing for physical factors can lead to energy and cost reductions of 5-20%, focusing our attention on social factors can lead to even higher net savings, providing greater return on investment. First, we will review how social factors differ from physical ones. Then we will explore several social factors that affect operating efficiency that are frequently overlooked as having potential for optimization, or at least taken for granted as being unavoidable. Finally, we will examine specific social factors where existing technology, either as is or in modified form, may be applied toward realizing substantial return on investment in terms of operating costs, along with reductions of fuel consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - Concerning the maritime transportation industry, according to the International Maritime Organization (the United Nations' regulatory body to ensure that the shipping industry contribution in emissions' reductions is managed effectively) CO2 emissions have increased by almost 70 per cent in the last 25 years. As a result of the imminent threat, the European Commission together with the organizations concerned with the decrease of the pollution level and the control of the greenhouse gas emissions decided to regulate the system through the introduction of new threshold via legislative measures. The paper highlights the results of a doctoral research concerning ship owners attitudes towards sustainable strategies designed to meet the requirements of the new regulations imposed by the International Maritime Organization. The first objective is to reveal the relevant measures undertaken by shipowners to support the decrease in greenhouse gas and non-greenhouse gas emissions. The second objective concerns to what extent these measures might economically influence the organizations performance and which are the benefits of implementing the policy mechanisms within the current economic environment.

AB  - The offshore wind industry currently relies on subsidy schemes to be competitive with fossil-fuel-based energy sources. For the wind industry to survive, it is vital that costs are significantly reduced for future projects. This can be partly achieved by introducing new technologies and partly through optimization of existing technologies and design methods. One of the areas where costs can be reduced is in the support structure, where better designs, cheaper fabrication and quicker installation might all be possible. The prevailing support structure design is the monopile structure, where the simple design is well suited to mass-fabrication, and the installation approach, based on conventional impact driving, is relatively low-risk and robust for most soil conditions. The range of application of the monopile for future wind farms can be extended by using more accurate engineering design methods, specifically tailored to offshore wind industry design. This paper describes how state-of-the-art optimization approaches are applied to the design of current wind farms and monopile support structures and identifies the main drivers where more accurate engineering methods could impact on a next generation of highly optimized monopiles.

AB  - Wetlands are carbon pools for terrestrial ecosystems and play an important role in the global carbon cycle. The Nanhui tidal flat is located at the Yangtze River estuary and has been disturbed by various human activities. However, the effect of human activities on the carbon accumulation capability and carbon storage of wetlands in the Nanhui tidal flat is poorly understood. In this study, the annual carbon accumulation capability and carbon storage of three types of Spartina alterniflora Loisel. wetlands in the Nanhui tidal flat, which were defined as a natural wetland, silt-promoting wetland, and artificial restored wetland, were evaluated by analyzing the plant carbon fixation capability, soil carbon emissions, and soil organic carbon (SOC) density. The results showed that the three wetlands all had a carbon sink effect and the natural wetland, artificial restored wetland, and silt-promoting wetland annually accumulated 7.94, 7.14, and 6.33 kg mâˆ’2 CO2, respectively. The existing SOC density in the subsurface soil (0â€“40 cm) in the natural wetland, silt-promoting wetland, and artificial restored wetland was 23.26, 17.95, and 12.21 kg mâˆ’2 CO2, respectively. The natural wetland, with no human disturbance, had a longer duration of waterlogging and greater tidal nutrition inputs than the other wetlands, resulting in a higher plant biomass and lower soil respiration (SR). It therefore had the strongest carbon accumulation capability and highest SOC storage. Â© 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

JO  - Ocean Engineering
PY  - 2018
VL  - 163

AB  - Ocean wave energy is a clean and inexhaustible energy resource, capable of providing more than 2 TW of energy supply worldwide. Among all the technologies available to convert wave energy, the point-absorber is one of the most promising solutions today, due to its ease of both fabrication and installation. The floaters of point-absorber WECs (wave energy converters) are generally exposed to harsh marine environments with great uncertainties in environmental loads, which make their reliability assessment quite challenging. In this work, a reliability assessment framework, which combines parametric finite element analysis (FEA) modelling, response surface modelling and reliability analysis, has been developed specifically for the floater of point-absorber WECs. An analytical model of point-absorber WECs is also developed in this work to calculate wave loads and to validate the developed FEA model. After the validation through a series of simulations, the reliability assessment framework has been applied to the NOTC (National Ocean Technology Centre) 10 kW multiple-point-absorber WEC to assess the reliability of the floater, considering the fatigue limit state (FLS). Optimisation of key design components is also performed based on reliability assessment in order to achieve target reliability. The results show that for the considered conditions, the WEC floater is prone to experience fatigue failure before the end of their nominal service life. It is demonstrated that the reliability assessment framework developed in this work is capable of accurately assessing the reliability of WECs and optimising the structure on the basis of reliability.

AB  - Biochar can sequestrate carbon (C) in soils and affect native soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization via priming effects. However, the roles of soil aggregation and microbial regulation in priming effects of biochars on SOC in coastal wetland soils are poorly understood. Thus, a coastal wetland soil (Î´13C âˆ’ 22â€°) was separated into macro-micro aggregates (53â€“2000 Î¼m, MA) and silt-clay fractions (&lt; 53 Î¼m, SF) to investigate the priming effect using two 13C enriched biochars produced from corn straw (Î´13C âˆ’ 11.58â€°) at 350 and 550 Â°C. The two biochars induced negative priming effect on the native SOC mineralization in the both soil aggregate size fractions, attributed to the enhanced stability of the soil aggregates resulting from the intimate physico-chemical associations between the soil minerals and biochar particles. Additionally, biochar amendments increased soil microbial biomass C and resulted in a lower metabolic quotient, suggesting that microbes in biochar amended aggregates could likely incorporate biomass C rather than mineralize it. Moreover, the biochar amendments induced obvious shifts of the bacterial community towards low C turnover bacteria taxa (e.g., Actinobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria) and the bacteria taxa responsible for stabilizing soil aggregates (e.g., Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria), which also accounted for the negative priming effect. Overall, these results suggested that biochar had considerable merit for stabilizing SOC in the coastal soil and thus has potential to restore and/or enhance â€œblue Câ€ sink in the degraded coastal wetland ecosystem.

AB  - In recent years, renewable energy increases rapidly. Since the electronic equipment has no rotational inertia, the inertia of the whole system decreased with the increase of the power electronics. For the voltage source converter based multi-terminal high voltage direct current system (VSC-MTDC) connecting with offshore wind farms, a new virtual synchronous generator control strategy with the consideration of virtual governor for was proposed in this paper. Firstly, the virtual governor control block has been designed based on the basis of the droop control of the VSC-MTDC system. This control strategy has the ability to provide inertia response and primary frequency regulation. Secondly, the stability analysis is performed according to the second order model of the controller. Finally, four terminals VSC-MTDC system is built in the DIgSIENT/PowerFactory, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the simulation results. Â© 2018 Chin. Soc. for Elec. Eng.

AB  - The proposed Swansea Bay tidal energy lagoon is an example of a relatively small-scale tidal barrage demonstrator project. A key concern with this technology is that such structures may exacerbate other environmental problems. However, such structures might also create beneficial environmental effects in some areas, such as mitigating the impact of storm surges. In this paper we model the hydrodynamics of the Swansea lagoon and surrounding area using a depth-averaged numerical model. We simulate a number of storm surge events from the past 40 years and analyse how the presence of the Swansea Lagoon (under various operating strategies) modifies the resulting water levels.

TI  - Carbon dioxide hydrate particles for ocean carbon sequestration
JO  - Energy Procedia
PY  - 2009
VL  - 1
IS  - 1
AB  - This paper presents strategies for producing negatively buoyant CO2 hydrate composite particles for ocean carbon sequestration. Our study is based on recent field observations showing that a continuous-jet hydrate reactor located at an ocean depth of 1500 m produced curved negatively buoyant cylindrical particles with diameters âˆ¼2.5Â cm and lengths up to âˆ¼1Â m. Accordingly we performed new laboratory experiments to determine the drag coefficient of such particles and, based on the measured drag coefficient and the initial settling velocity observed in the field, have concluded that the reactor efficiency (percentage of liquid CO2 converted to hydrate) in the field was âˆ¼16%. Using the dissolution rates observed in the field, we conclude that such particles would ultimately sink to depth below discharge of âˆ¼115Â m. We have also predicted the sinking depth of particles potentially produced from various scaled-up reactors and have shown that, for example, a 10 cm diameter particle produced with a hydrate conversion of 50% could reach the ocean bottom before completely dissolving. In a real sequestration scenario, we are interested in following large groups of hydrate particles released continuously. We have previously shown that increasing particle size and hydrate conversion efficiency enhances the sinking of hydrate particle plumes produced by the continuous release of CO2 in a quiescent ambient, but that a sufficiently strong current will cause the entrained particles to separate from the plume and settle discretely. In the latter case, particles of different sizes and hydrate conversions (hence different settling velocities) will follow different settling trajectories as they dissolve. This particle fractionation, if employed deliberately, spreads the discharged CO2 in the down current and vertical directions, enhancing mixing, while turbulent diffusion helps spread the CO2 in the third direction. A numerical model that incorporates these processes is used to predict the downstream concentrations and changes in pH from such particle plumes in a 'strong' current. An extension of this model simulates hydrate particles that are released continuously from a moving ship. Because of the ship speed, such particles would never form a coherent plume, but the combination of particle fractionation and advection due to the ship motion produces excellent dilution of the discharged CO2.

AB  - Treatment of high concentration chlorinated VOC, e.g., pentachlorophenol, trichloroethylene, methylene chloride, and vinyl chloride, at high DRE and with negligible byproduct emissions using flameless thermal oxidizer (FTO) was studied. The treatment systems included a recuperated FTO including a wet quench and packed tower acid gas scrubber. Key design features include an inlet dilution air control system to adjust for high methane concentrations, and an FTO systems with a heat recovery designed to reduce operating costs without creating conditions associated with the reformation of products of incomplete combustion. Due to the nature of the contaminated soils located adjacent to marine tidal flats, in-situ thermal desorption technology is expected to be implemented during final cleanup operations. Source test results from pilot study and interim cleanup operations demonstrated > 99.9% DRE and dioxin/furan emission several orders of magnitude less than permitted levels.

Power transmission and hydrogen production are the two ways to develop and utilize offshore wind power. Firstly in this paper, a life-cycle cost model for offshore wind power transmission is established. Secondly, the energy efficiency calculation process of the proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer was derived. Based on the "power-efficiency" characteristic model of the PEM electrolyzer, the hydrogen production yield was assessed, and the life-cycle cost model of the off-shore wind power hydrogen production project was formulated. Finally, case studies are conducted to evaluate the economic benefits of these two approaches respectively. Â© 2022 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The latest guidelines approved by the environmental protection committee of the international maritime organization (IMO) will require the shipping sector to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% before 2050 and achieve a complete decarbonization by the end of the century. This will require a major change in the way ships are built and operated today. In this paper, we aim at understanding what types of ship energy systems and fuels will be preferable and what will be the costs to achieve the environmental goals set by IMO for shipping. To do this, we approach the question as an MILP problem, with increasingly stringent constraints on the total GHG emissions and with the objective of minimizing the total cost of ownership. We apply this analysis to three ship types (a containership, a tanker, and a passenger ferry) and we determine what type of choice for the shipâ€™s energy systems will be the most optimal, for each ship type. The results show that the most cost-effective pathway towards the elimination of GHG emissions is composed of a first phase with LNG as fuel and with an increasing use of carbon capture and storage, while the full decarbonisation of the shipping sector will require switching to hydrogen as fuel. These results depend only marginally on the type of ship investigated and on the type of regulation enforced. While the costs required to achieve up to 75% GHG emission reduction are relatively similar to the baseline case (50-70% higher), moving towards a full decarbonisation will require a cost increase ranging between 280% and 340% higher than the business as usual.

TI  - Container fleet renewal considering multiple sulfur reduction technologies and uncertain markets amidst COVID-19
JO  - Journal Of Cleaner Production
PY  - 2021
VL  - 317
IS  - NA
AB  - The onset of 2020 is marked by stricter restrictions on maritime sulfur emissions and the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this background, liner companies now face the challenge to find suitable sulfur reduction technologies, make reasonable decisions on fleet renewal, and prepare stable operation plans under the highly uncertain shipping market. Considering three sulfur reduction technologies, namely, fuel-switching, scrubber, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) dual-fuel engine, this paper develops a robust optimization model based on two-stage stochastic linear programming (SLP) to formulate a decision plan for container fleet, which can deal with various uncertainties in future: freight demand, ship charter rate, fuel price, retrofit time and Sulfur Emission Control Area (SECA) ratio. The main decision contents include ship acquisition, ship retrofit, ship sale, ship charter, route assignment, and speed optimization. The effectiveness of our plan was verified through a case study on two liner routes from the Far East to Northwest America, operated by COSCO Shipping Lines. The results from SLP model show that large-capacity fuel-switching ships and their LNG dual-fuel engine retrofits should be included in the long-term investment and operation plan; slow-steaming is an important operational decision for ocean liner shipping; if the current SECA boundary is not further expanded or the sulfur emission restrictions not further tightened, the scrubber ship will have no advantage in investment cost and operation. However, considering the probabilities of more flexible scenarios, the results from the robust model suggest that it is beneficial to install scrubber on medium-capacity fuel-switching ships, and carry out more LNG dual-fuel engine retrofits for large-capacity fuel-switching ships. Compared with SLP, this robust strategy greatly reduces sulfur emissions while slightly pushing up carbon emissions.

Double-cambered S-Blade profiles have been found to give better performance for this purpose. An S-Blade profile has convex and concave curvatures on both upper and lower surfaces, making the flow very complicated even at small angles of attack. In the present investigation, flow visualization studies have been carried out to get better insight into the behavior of flow over S-Blade profiles. The medium used is water, and fine aluminium powder was used as the tracer. Studies have been carried out to get the influence of maximum camber and maximum thickness at angles of attack varying from - 8Â° to + 8Â°. Copyright Â© 1998 by Begell House, Inc.

AB  - Partners from CREATING (Concepts to reduce environmental impact and attain optimal transport performance by inland navigation) project, together with BP, have developed a new vessel, which they claim is virtually emission-free. The Cleanest Ship uses novel technologies for speed control, low sulfur fuel use, SCR, and particulate matter filters. The Victoria, managed by Verenigde Tankrederij, is on long-term charter to BP Marine Lubricants and operates in the Port of Rotterdam and Antwerp areas. The vessel had to undergo various modifications, which are expected to cut down NOx emissions and particulate matter, while SOx emissions will almost be completely eliminated and CO2 emissions are expected to be reduced. Victoria's SOx emissions have been cut by almost 100% by changing the fuel from a fuel oil with 1000 ppm sulfur prior to the project, to using an ultra-low sulfur fuel oil similar to diesel used by trucks with just 10 ppm sulfur.

AB  - Air emissions from fishing vessels must be reduced to comply with progressively stringent environmental regulations. Among the available solutions, liquefied natural gas (LNG) fuel may represent a promising solution, particularly from an environmental perspective. However, the use of LNG as a marine fuel creates different types of hazards than those that exist for traditional fuels. In addition, the increased complexity, safety requirements, and space required for LNG installation increase the capital cost. This article uses a systems engineering approach to clarify the technical aspects of LNG-fuelled systems, their potential implementation costs, and the expertise and training required to operate them safely. Ship owners can use such an approach to aid decision-making and trade-off analyses. Naval architects may also benefit from better information management. Finally, crews may better understand the logic behind the safety actions they are instructed to take. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Current investigations on suction buckets for offshore wind energy turbines â€“ the ProBucket project. Suction buckets are established offshore foundations for oil and gas platforms that have been used only marginally in the wind energy sector. These foundations can be installed together with the substructure, avoiding additional offshore operations such as grouting of transition pieces or jacket legs. Furthermore, unlike pile foundations, installing suction buckets is essentially silent, so no additional noise-reducing measures are necessary. For these reasons, suction buckets are a viable and potentially cost-effective foundation solution for offshore wind turbines. The ProBucket research project started in 2020 and is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action. The project aims to reduce the uncertainties of the various design procedures through physical and numerical investigations. This paper explains the current challenges for designing and economical implementation of suction buckets for offshore wind turbines. Furthermore, the research activities of ProBucket are described.

AB  - Climate change is driving an expansion of marine oxygen-deficient zones, which may alter the global cycles of carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, and trace metals. Currently, however, we lack a full mechanistic understanding of how oxygen deficiency affects organic carbon cycling and burial. Here, we show that cryptic microbial sulfate reduction occurs in sinking particles from the eastern tropical North Pacific oxygen-deficient zone and that some microbially produced sulfide reacts rapidly to form organic sulfur that is resistant to acid hydrolysis. Particle-hosted sulfurization could enhance carbon preservation in sediments underlying oxygen-deficient water columns and serve as a stabilizing feedback between expanding anoxic zones and atmospheric carbon dioxide. A similar mechanism may help explain more-extreme instances of organic carbon preservation associated with marine anoxia in Earth history. Â© 2021 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

AB  - The carbon capture, utilization and storage (hereinafter referred to as "CCUS") technology has already been widely regarded as an available method of great potential for carbon dioxide emission reduction. As predicted, the emission reduction contribution will rise from 3% of the total emission reduction amount in 2020 to 10% in 2030, and to about 20% in 2050, which becomes the individual technology of the greatest contribution to the carbon dioxide emission reduction. This paper illustrates the main links of CCUS technology: the carbon capture process, carbon transport, carbon utilization and carbon storage. This paper introduces the storage methods of carbon dioxide, the geological storage and marine storage. In addition, this paper also analyzes the main storage practices both at home and abroad, the major overseas storage projects and the present status and progress of China's storage.

AB  - The world's oceans, from the coasts to the abysses, harbor an incredible level of microbial diversity. This marine microbial biosphere is an enormous, untapped resource of biotechnological interest. This chapter reviews the potential of marine microbes in biotechnology. The biotechnological potential is considerable, ranging from the synthesis of bioactive molecules to the production of biofuels, cosmeceuticals, nutraceuticals, and biopolymers; from the engineering of marine microbes for biomedical purposes to the degradation of pollutants, and the use of microbial biosensors as sentinels for environmental quality. Marine viruses have great biotechnological potential, yet the exploration of the marine virome, and the associated gene and protein pool, is only beginning. Marine archaea have so far been exploited for the isolation of enzymes, yet many biotechnological exploitations can be foreseen. Bacteria and microbial eukaryotes, especially fungi and photosynthetic protists, provide an important contribution to biotechnology; the combination of omics-driven technologies and improved cultivation techniques is widening the knowledge on their biological diversity, paving the way for new biotechnological exploitations. The exploration of the marine microbial biosphere, and its extraordinary genetic and physiological diversity, will undoubtedly continue to offer chances for the development of new and sustainable blue biotechnologies, helping to solve important societal challenges of the twenty-first century.

AB  - To mitigate marine atmospheric pollution causing greenhouse gas (GHG) and a threat to coastal residents' health in dense hub port cities, the Vessel Speed Reduction (VSR) programs were implemented in the Republic of Korea. Spatial analysis of the efficiency of the VSR programs is essential to monitor and improve the present programs. In the present study, the efficiency of the VSRs from the Busan Port (BP), including North Port (NP) and Gamcheon Port (GP), were analyzed. A bottom-up activity-based approach using automatic identification system (AIS) data was introduced herein for the estimation of spatial marine gas emission in real time. The BP has implemented the VSR program since 2020; thus, this study spatially analyzed marine gas emissions in the areas in 2019 and 2020 to demonstrate the efficiency of VSR. To demonstrate the VSR programs in the aspect of the comparison of gas emissions in each year, the total annual fuel consumption in each year is divided by the total arrival ships' GT respectively. According to the comparison of the spatial gas emission inventory between two years in the designed area, 19.2\% of the annual marine gas emissions per ships' GT in BP in 2020 were reduced with the implementation of the VSR program. The spatial analysis clearly showed the mitigation of the ships' gas emissions along the passageway to BP. The spatial analysis of the efficiency of the VSR program will be useful basic data to reflect the local gas emission state on the improvement of the VSR program and newly established environmental regulations.

JO  - Restoration Ecology

VL  - NA
IS  - SI
AB  - Restoration of coastal wetlands has the potential to deliver both climate change mitigation, called blue carbon, and adaptation benefits to coastal communities, as well as supporting biodiversity and providing additional ecosystem services. Valuing carbon sequestration may incentivize restoration projects; however, it requires development of rigorous methods for quantifying blue carbon sequestered during coastal wetland restoration. We describe the development of a blue carbon accounting model (BlueCAM) used within the Tidal Restoration of Blue Carbon Ecosystems Methodology Determination 2022 of the Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF), which is Australia's voluntary carbon market scheme. The new BlueCAM uses Australian data to estimate abatement from carbon and greenhouse gas sources and sinks arising from coastal wetland restoration (via tidal restoration) and aligns with the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories. BlueCAM includes carbon sequestered in soils and biomass and avoided emissions from alternative land uses. A conservative modeled approach was used to provide estimates of abatement (as opposed to on-ground measurements); and in doing so, this will reduce the costs associated with monitoring and verification for ERF projects and may increase participation in blue carbon projects by Australian landholders. BlueCAM encompasses multiple climate regions and plant communities and therefore may be useful to others outside Australia seeking to value blue carbon benefits from coastal wetland restoration.

AB  - Coastal wetland carbon pools are globally important, but their response to interacting facets of global change remain unclear. Numerical models neglect species-specific vegetation responses to sea level rise (SLR) and elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) that are observed in field experiments, while field experiments cannot address the long-term feedbacks between flooding and soil growth that models show are important. Here, we present a novel numerical model of marsh carbon accumulation parameterized with empirical observations from a long-running eCO(2) experiment in an organic rich, brackish marsh. Model results indicate that eCO(2) and SLR interact synergistically to increase soil carbon burial, driven by shifts in plant community composition and soil volume expansion. However, newly parameterized interactions between plant biomass and decomposition (i.e. soil priming) reduce the impact of eCO(2) on marsh survival, and by inference, the impact of eCO(2) on soil carbon accumulation.

AB  - Sea grass beds and tidal flats are facing imminent dangers of extinction. Steel slags are one of the promising alternative materials for marine sands to restore sea grass beds and tidal flats. On the other hand, significant pH increase and solidification attributed to dissolving calcium released from the slags are sometimes negative impact on ecosystems. To quantify the dissolved calcium, Japan Cement Association Standard method is conventionally used. However, our study leveled the method underestimate the dissolved calcium from the steel slags. The purpose of this study is to optimize the determination method for maximum calcium releasing potential from steel slags. Powdered sample (0.1 g) was stirred in 40 mL of 99.5\% ethyleneglycol-100 mM tris buffer solution for 6 h at 80 +/- 5 degrees C. Thereafter, the solution filter through 0.45 mu m filter and the dissolved calcium was determined by ICP-AES. The optimized condition proposed in this study recovered the dissolved calcium from the slag in seawater perfectly.

JO  - Engineering Structures
PY  - 2022
VL  - 255
IS  - NA
AB  - Offshore wind energy harnessing is a major source of renewable energy. From the design perspective, it is crucial to properly determine environmental load effects on offshore wind turbines concurrently subjected to wind, wave and currents as reflected in a realistic offshore environment. Accordingly, the focus of the present study is on addressing this issue in the form of small-scale laboratory experiments in the Wind-Wave-Current Tank (WWCT) at Newcastle University, UK, using a scaled model of an offshore wind turbine. The hydrodynamic surge force exerted by currents represents a major contribution to the overall average loads. The waves are the main source of the unsteady loads. Higher amplitude waves cause an increase in the relative standard deviation of the integral loads, an effect which is more pronounced at greater wind and current velocities. While increasing the wind raises the dynamic loads at the natural frequency of the wind turbine, i.e., inertial loads, whereas currents introduce loads, which occur particularly at low frequencies due to nonlinear hydrodynamics, both observations were made in the absence of waves. If the waves are also present, the dynamic loads on the offshore wind turbines are primarily at the wave frequency, i.e. wave-induced dynamic loads on the offshore wind turbines are predominant. Higher modes of the surge and sway force fluctuations are more pronounced when all three load components act concurrently than is the case when the current or the wind acts in isolation. These trends may be further amplified in the dynamic response of floating wind turbines as noted in previous computational studies involving tension leg platforms. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations in CO2 flux in a fringing reef simulated using a novel carbonate system dynamics model
JO  - Coral Reefs
PY  - 2013
VL  - 32
IS  - 1
AB  - A carbonate system dynamics (CSD) model was developed in a fringing reef on the east coast of Ishigaki Island, southwest Japan, by incorporating organic and inorganic carbon fluxes (photosynthesis and calcification), air-sea gas exchanges, and benthic cover of coral and seagrass into a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model. The CSD model could reproduce temporal variations in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity in coral zones, but not in seagrass meadows. The poor reproduction in seagrass meadows can be attributed to significant contributions of submarine groundwater discharge as well as misclassification of remotely sensed megabenthos in this area. In comparison with offshore areas, the reef acted as a CO2 sink during the observation period when it was averaged over 24 h. The CSD model also indicated large spatiotemporal differences in the carbon dioxide (CO2) sink/source, possibly related to hydrodynamic features such as effective offshore seawater exchange and neap/spring tidal variation. This suggests that the data obtained from a single point observation may lead to misinterpretation of the overall trend and thus should be carefully considered. The model analysis also showed that the advective flux of DIC from neighboring grids is several times greater than local biological flux of DIC and is three orders of magnitude greater than the air-sea gas flux at the coral zone. Sensitivity tests in which coral or seagrass covers were altered revealed that the CO2 sink potential was much more sensitive to changes in coral cover than seagrass cover.

AB  - The new regulations on emissions and energy efficiency in the amendment to MARPOL Annex VI will become effective on January 1, 2013. The old-type marine main engine is difficult to come up to the new standard. Determining how to reduce the NOx, CO2 emissions and improve energy efficiency of ships draws a lot attention. The adaptability of marine dual fuel engine on the new regulations, EEDI and EEOI was studied, and the prospect of dual fuel engine is analyzed in this paper. To some extent, it has guiding meaning in the development of the marine main engine.

AB  - There are incentives from maritime regulatory bodies to operate ships more efficiently, driven by the need to reduce CO2 budget. In order to establish more efficient ship operations, fuel consumption across the full operational profile of a vessel is needed. This could be accomplished through a complete characterisation through extensive sea-trials, or interpretation of data from monitoring systems. Results from repeated testing under controlled sea-trial conditions provides high-fidelity data, however, this approach is prohibitively expensive and requires repeating as the condition of the vessel changes with time. Conversely, data monitoring devices are relatively inexpensive, however, the process of analysing data can be complex, particularly when a ship's activities are diverse. This paper describes a methodology for associating ship activity with corresponding segments of a data-stream from a commercially available monitoring system. Further analysis is then performed to determine the fuel efficient performance of the ship. The case-study used is a harbour tug, although the approach used is applicable to other ship types, its success on this basis indicates the methodology is robust. To validate the methodology, results from the data analysis are compared to fuel consumption data measured under sea-trial conditions, and are found to be in close agreement. (c) 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Abundant seawater resources can replace the shortage of freshwater resources. The co-production of xylo-oligosaccharides and glucose from sugarcane bagasse by subcritical CO2-assisted seawater pretreatment was studied in this paper. We investigated the effects of pretreatment conditions of temperature, CO2 pressure and reaction time on the yield ofxylo-oligosaccharides in subcritical CO2-assisted seawater systems. The maximum xylo-oligosaccharide yield of 68.23\% was obtained at 165 degrees C/2 MPa/5 min. After further enzymatic hydrolysis of the solid residue, the highest glucose yield of 94.45\% was obtained. In this system, there is a synergistic effect of mixed ions in seawater and CO2 to depolymerize xylan into xylo-oligosaccharides with a lower degree of polymerization. At the same time, the addition of CO2 increased the pore size and porosity of sugarcane bagasse, improved the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis and increased the yield of glucose. Therefore, this study provides a more environmentally friendly and sustainable process for the co-production of xylo-oligosaccharides and glucose from sugarcane bagasse, and improves the utilization of seawater resources.

PY  - 2016
VL  - 111
IS  - NA
AB  - A waste heat recovery system produces power by utilizing the heat energy lost to the surroundings from thermal processes, at no additional fuel input. For marine vessels, about 50 percent of the total fuel energy supplied to diesel power-plant aboard is lost to the surroundings. While the total amount of wasted energy is considerable, the quality of this energy is quite low due to its low temperature and has limited potential for power production. Effective waste heat recovery systems use the available low temperature waste heat to produce mechanical/electrical power with high efficiency value. In this study a review of different waste heat recovery systems has been conducted, to lay out the potential recovery efficiencies and suitability for marine applications. This work helps in identifying the most suitable heat recovery technologies for maritime use depending on the properties of shipboard waste heat and achievable recovery efficiencies, whilst discussing the features of each type of system.

AB  - The future `SuperGrid' may requires the benefit of both offshore AC network and multi-terminal DC grid. AC cable limits the power transfer capability from the larger offshore wind farm, however, HVDC transmission system is economical viable for large power wind farm integration with the grid. Another approach to develop the offshore network infrastructure is by forming an offshore AC grid connecting several offshore wind farms. Then, this offshore AC network is connected with different onshore grid using HVDC system. This enhances the trade among the countries as well as provide an economical solution for wind energy integration. In this article, operational and control concept of voltage source converter is presented to integrate an offshore AC grid with an offshore DC grid. The article presents the control principle of offshore AC network frequency and voltage with respect to active and reactive power distribution in the AC network. Later, the principle of multi-terminal HVDC system is discussed with respect to power distribution using DC voltage droop control. Power distribution criteria are defined with respect to operator power-sharing requirement and network stability. In the end, a hybrid AC/DC offshore grid is modelled and simulated in MATLAB/SIMU LINK to validate the distribution criteria.

JO  - Reliability Engineering And System Safety
PY  - 2020
VL  - 202
IS  - NA
AB  - A risk-based maintenance planning for offshore wind farm installations is developed. Initially, the optimal number of monopile offshore wind turbines to be installed in an offshore wind farm is estimated, targeting a minimum levelised cost of energy. To this end, a sufficient number of design combinations for monopile support structure is generated by the design of experiment technique and then analysed based on the fatigue limit state. Following the fatigue reliability analysis performed for the monopile designs, an analytical relation between manufacturing cost and the structural safety regarding fatigue is developed to be used in the life-cycle cost analysis. The offshore wind farm is considered here as a system consisting of correlated components. The system reliability is estimated by using Ditlevsen bounding technique, which uses a time-variant correlation matrix of offshore wind turbines. The event tree method is employed to assess the expected cost of failure to be included in the capital investment as the structural risk premium, and the total expected cost to be included in the operational cost. Furthermore, different inspection policies are studied, and the most cost-effective inspection and maintenance policy is found for each studied wind farm. The present study also develops a novel framework for inspection and maintenance planning that maximises the benefits of performing inspections for a multi-unit system. Finally, the developed framework is applied to an offshore wind farm with sixty installations, and the detailed description of the planned inspections are discussed. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Flexibility Analysis of O&G Platform Power System with Wind Energy Integration
JO  - Journal Of Physics: Conference Series
PY  - 2022
VL  - 2362
IS  - 1
AB  - Many researchers and operators are assessing the impact of wind energy integration into the gas turbines based conventional power system due to the intermittent and variable nature. The flexibility characteristics of the gas turbines are vital to guarantee adequate performance at different levels of wind energy penetration to meet the demand of the O&G platform. This study aims to verify the impact of increasing flexibility of the offshore O&G platformâ€™s power system. Therefore, the conventional O&G platform power system is modelled and compared with the post-flexibilization or state-of-the-art power system at different dynamic restrictions of the Open-Cycle Gas Turbines (OCGT) like ramp rates, minimum loading, uptime and downtime, and start-up/shut-down costs. Subsequently, the conventional and state-of-the-art power system model are then simulated at different levels of wind energy penetration, to analyze the system response of the O&G platform, as the intermittent wind energy can generate critical power system instability and imbalance. The proposed model has 4 OCGTs of 33.3MW (locally installed at the O&G platform) and 4 offshore floating wind turbines of 15MW that is satisfying 2 different load profiles of O&G platform (68MW and 34MW average load). The simulation results highlighted that the state-of-the-art power system accommodated higher shares of wind energy as compared to the conventional power system due to the flexible constraints. Also, the flexible power system achieved higher levels of fuel saving, when simulated for 100 hours. The same case study was considered for 25 years and the hours of fuel saving at 5% was 1733 hours and 20% of wind penetration resulted in 1857 hours of fuel saving. The study was performed in the modified Python for Power System Analysis (PyPSA), a python based free simulation toolbox for optimizing the power dispatch. Â© 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing.

AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has recently discussed the introduction of a new design index called the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), which is a measure of the total carbon dioxide emissions divided by the amount of cargo carried and by the distance travelled on a one-year basis. In this study, authors have analysed a cruise ship assuming its size, the electrical and thermal power required, and its operative profile. CII is calculated with reference to a 180,000 GRT cruise ship equipped with different possible power plant configurations. Emissions in these scenarios are abated by employing alternative fuels like Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), a shore connection, or innovative technologies like Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC). The analysis affirms that a cruise ship powered only by MGO from 2024 will not comply with the CII regulation. Results highlight the potential of LNG in reducing carbon dioxide emissions and, for the reference vessel, the use of LNG alone can guarantee a maximum CII rating up to 2026. The benefits of the installation of 10 MW of SOFC are relevant and similar to the one archived with a power plant composed of dual-fuel internal combustion engines and a shore connection.

AB  - Extensive CO2 vents have been discovered in the Wagner Basin, northern Gulf of California, where they create large areas with lowered seawater pH. Such areas are suitable for investigations of long-term biological effects of ocean acidification and effects of CO2 leakage from subsea carbon capture storage. Here, we show responses of benthic foraminifera to seawater pH gradients at 74-207m water depth. Living (rose Bengal stained) benthic foraminifera included Nonionella basispinata, Epistominella bradyana and Bulimina marginata. Studies on foraminifera at CO2 vents in the Mediterranean and off Papua New Guinea have shown dramatic long-term effects of acidified seawater. We found living calcareous benthic foraminifera in low pH conditions in the northern Gulf of California, although there was an impoverished species assemblage and evidence of post-mortem test dissolution.

JO  - Proceedings Of The International Offshore And Polar Engineering Conference
PY  - 2005

AB  - Wave power distribution is investigated to find out the optimal sites for wave power generation at Jeju sea which is considered to contain the highest wave energy density in Korean coastal waters. The spatial and seasonal variation of wave power per unit length is calculated in Jeju sea area based on monthly mean wave data from 1979 to 2002 which was produced by SWAN wave model simulation. The selected favorable locations for wave power generation are compared in terms of magnitude of wave energy density and distribution characteristics of wave parameters, suggesting that Chagui-Do is the most optimal site for wave power generation at Jeju sea. The seasonal distribution of wave energy density reveals that the highest wave energy density occurs at northwest sea in the winter and it is dominated by wind waves, while the second highest one happens at south sea in the summer and it is dominated by swell sea. The annual average of wave energy density gradually increases from east to west of Jeju sea. At Chagui-Do, the energy density of swell sea is relatively uniform while the energy density of wind waves is fluctuating. The distribution of wave directions implies that except the rear region of island influenced by wave refraction, the northwest wave direction is dominant in summer and the southeast in winter. Wave periods are longer in summer and winter and it appears relatively longer at the west sea of Jeju than east's. The longest wave period occurs at the west sea in winter, and in summer it appears relatively homogeneous with a little longer period at the south sea.

JO  - Applied Energy
PY  - 2022
VL  - 312
IS  - NA
AB  - Increasing global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions call for new operation strategies towards low-carbon marine transportation. This paper proposes a coordinated operation strategy for a ship micorgird with hybrid propulsion systems (HPSs) to minimize the whole-voyage operation cost within GHG emission limitations. Hydrogen fuel cells are integrated to the ship microgrid for further reduction of GHG emissions. Purchase costs of fuel, hydrogen and electricity and degradation costs of fuel cells (FCs) and batteries are considered in the calculation of whole-voyage operation cost. The proposed coordinated operation strategy consists of two stages. At the pre-voyage scheduling stage, the amount of purchased fuel, hydrogen and electricity, the power of diesel engines (DEs) and FCs, the charging/discharging states of batteries and the motor/shaft-generator modes of electric machines (EMs) are formulated to minimize the whole-voyage operation cost under the worst case of uncertain propulsion and auxiliary power. At the intra-voyage operation stage, power of batteries and EMs is optimized according to the short-leading-time prediction of propulsion and auxiliary power. Above coordinated operation strategy is formulated as a two-stage robust optimization model and solved by a two-level column-and-constraint-generation (C&CG) algorithm. Numerical simulations based on a practical voyage are carried out to validate the effectiveness of proposed strategy. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

JO  - Journal Of Petroleum Science And Engineering
PY  - 2020
VL  - 194
IS  - NA
AB  - Monitoring of sequestered CO2 at storage sites is essential to provide assurance of long-term storage integrity. Thus, the objective of this study was to develop a sorbent-based offshore monitoring concept to monitor CO2 leakage during CO2-EOR operations. The study site, where the CO2-EOR operation is planned to be undertaken, is located in the pre-salt layer offshore Brazil. Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) were selected as tracers for monitoring possible CO2 leakage. A passive sampling technique was proposed to adsorb the injected tracer. Several commercially available sampler materials were initially chosen, among which Carboxen 569 placed inside a polyethersulphone (PES) membrane was tested and selected to be the preferred passive sampler combination. In order to perform tracer uptake rate experiments, a flow through experimental setup was built, optimized and tested under in-situ conditions of 300 bar and 15Â°C. In addition, a desorption unit was designed to quantify the tracer amount sorbed to the sampler during the experiments. The developed passive sampler combination proved to be successful in sorbing the tracers. The phase distribution of the tracer candidates in a CO2-water-oil system were investigated in a slimtube setup. It is shown that the PFCs have a shorter travel time through the system than CO2 and will potentially provide a warning of CO2 leakage from the reservoir. Although the developed technique successfully proved the proposed concept of monitoring CO2 leakage, further testing to investigate the life cycle of the sampler will be necessary to apply this technique at field scale.

JO  - Renewable Energy
PY  - 2019
VL  - 135
IS  - NA
AB  - Offshore wind energy has more favorable wind conditions than its terrestrial counterpart, so a reliable estimate of the wind potential in the atmospheric boundary layer is of great importance to justify the energy viability of new offshore wind farms. In this paper a method is developed to determine the annual energy production of a wind turbine in open sea, which takes into account the continuous variations of the atmospheric stability and the roughness of the sea surface, from the measurements made with masts of measurements, where meteorological data are obtained at levels much lower than those of the hub. As an application, the wind speed is first extrapolated with the height, from the measurements obtained in the German research platform FINO 3, in the North Sea, during the years 2015, 2016 and 2017. Then, it is applied to the calculation of the electrical energy of a 3.0 MW commercial wind turbine, with the hub at 80 m above the sea surface. The results obtained were compared with the data of the wind speed provided at this height by the platform, and its application to the calculation of the energy, presenting acceptable deviations in all the years of study.

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Microgrids on the islands integrate multiple types of renewable energy resources, e.g., PV, tidal energy, and wave energy, to support local power consumption. The grid-forming converters equipped with battery energy storage systems play a vital role in regulating the system frequency and voltage in island microgrids while smoothing the fluctuations of these renewable energy resources. However, for grid-forming converters, there exists a high risk of transient instability in the case of large disturbances. In this work, a data-driven predictive control strategy is proposed to enhance the stability of the grid-forming converter in island microgrids. By replacing the mathematical model predictor with a two-layer gate recurrent unite (GRU) neural network, the data-driven predictive control strategy can precisely predict the virtual power angle trajectory. Furthermore, the proposed control strategy is capable of driving participating grid-forming converters to follow the center of inertia, which can effectively enhance the convergence performance and avoid significant power oscillations. Extensive case studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed DPC strategy. Â© 2022 IEEE.

AB  - After some introductory considerations on the wave energy resource and the technology for its utilization, the paper concentrates on the more mature devices developed to be located on the shoreline or near shore (the so-called first generation devices), especially those that have reached the stage of full-sized prototype deployed in open sea waters. Apart from a brief reference to the shoreline TAPCHAN converter, the rest of the paper is devoted mostly to the oscillating water column (OWC). The principal factors affecting the technological development and the economics are analysed, taking into consideration the experience from existing prototypes: device siting, hydrodynamics and structure geometry, structural design and construction, power take-off equipment (turbine, electrical generator) and control. Special attention is devoted to two critical factors: civil construction and ways of reducing its costs, and air turbine conception and performance. The paper concludes with some perspectives on first generation wave energy technology.

AB  - The efficient utilization of energy is of high importance for shipboard applications, for environmental and economic reasons as well as maximized vessel operation. The electrification of marine systems facilitates the storage and generation of energy from multiple sources, offering the potential for energy savings, due to the flexibility associated with electric systems. In this paper, an energy management system (EMS) based on bond graph system models used in conjunction with a stochastic search algorithm is proposed and developed. The EMS optimizes the configuration of the vessel's onboard machinery system based on the current operating condition. The approach is universal, with the system model and optimization routine being separate and distinct. The effectiveness of the proposed EMS is demonstrated using a real operating profile of a roll-on/roll-off vessel fitted with a hybrid machinery configuration including energy storage, onshore power supply, and photovoltaic generation. The results show fuel savings of around 23\% compared with current fuel consumption levels.

TI  - A Preliminary Study on the Application of Thermal Storage to Merchant Ships
JO  - Energy Procedia
PY  - 2015
VL  - 75
IS  - NA
AB  - The shipping industry is focusing more and more on reducing fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. A non-negligible amount of fuel is consumed while ships are in port, waiting for loading or unloading, for heating up accommodation spaces and fuel tanks, while when at sea waste heat from engines exhaust is under-used because of low demand. In this paper we propose the use of thermal energy storage as a solution for the mismatch between heat availability and demand. A simplified system is proposed and the influence of design parameters (storage size, heat exchangers surface, secondary fluid mass flow rate, storage temperature) on the performance of the system is analyzed. The results of the application of a thermal energy storage system to a case study ship show that the installation of a storage tank of 1000 m3 could reduce the fuel consumption from the boilers by 80%, which would lead to yearly savings of 268,000 USD. This preliminary analysis shows that there is potential of both economic and environmental benefits from the application of thermal energy storage to merchant vessels. Â© 2015 The Authors.

TI  - CO2 electrolysis in seawater: calcification effect and a hybrid self-powered concept
JO  - Journal Of Materials Chemistry A
PY  - 2018
VL  - 6
IS  - 46
AB  - Oceans are regarded as a sink for anthropogenic CO2; as such seawater provides an attractive electrolyte for electrochemical CO2 reduction to value-added carbon-based fuels and chemical feedstocks. However, the composition of seawater is inherently complex, containing multiple cations and anions that may participate in the CO2 electroreduction reaction. Herein, examination of a nanoporous Ag electrocatalyst in seawater reveals a significant influence of calcium ions on the electrochemical CO2 reduction performance. Under the applied cathodic potential and in the presence of CO2, calcium ions in the seawater result in calcium carbonate deposition onto the nanoporous Ag, reducing active sites for CO2 electroreduction. Mitigation of calcification would promote a stable CO2 electrolysis in seawater. A first proof-of-concept self-powered hybrid CO2 electrolysis is demonstrated by the coupling of a Mg anode to a nanoporous Ag cathode in 0.6 M NaCl or seawater. A spontaneous oxidation of a Mg alloy at the anode drives cathodic reduction of AgCl to nanoporous Ag, which electrocatalytically reduces CO2 to CO. Combining galvanic and electrolytic properties in a single electrochemical cell offers a general approach for designing hybrid self-powered electrolysers. Strategies to overcome calcification such as removal of calcium from the seawater and development of anti-calcifying electrocatalysts are needed to promote practicability of seawater as an electrolyte in CO2 electroreduction technology.

JO  - Ecological Indicators
PY  - 2021
VL  - 121
IS  - NA
AB  - In an increasingly anthropogenic world, the scientific community and managers have to take interactions between the drivers of ecosystems into consideration. Tools like ecological network analysis (ENA) indices offer the opportunity to study those interactions at the ecosystem level. However, ENA indices have never been used to test the incidence of cumulative drivers. The present study uses models combining the effects of (i) the reef caused by the future offshore wind farm of Courseulles-sur-Mer and (ii) climate change on species distribution, to test the response of multiple ENA indices. ENA indices proved sensitive to this cumulative impact, displaying a wide variety of cumulative effects. They were also very powerful to characterize the role of the cumulative impact on ecosystem functioning. These results demonstrate the capacity of ENA indices to describe and understand cumulative effects at the ecosystem scale. Using a sensitivity analysis approach, this study shows that ENA indices could be viable tools for managers. To help them in their tasks, the next step could be to link ecosystem services to ENA indices for a more practical use.

VL  - 45
IS  - 6
AB  - The present paper, for the first time, estimates the amount of soil and vegetative blue carbon (C) sequestered in Khuran mangrove, Iran's largest mangrove forest along the Persian Gulf coasts. Cores were retrieved down to parental materials in 32 stations to achieve whole-soil C stock. A radiocarbon dating was also used to estimate sediment accretion and C sequestration rates during the last 18 centuries. Results indicated that soils and mangrove trees of the Khuran store a total of 16.79 Tg C (equivalent to similar to 60 Tg of CO2), 98.8\% of which (16.59 Tg C) is sequestered in mangrove soils. During the last couple of thousand years, 8967 Mg C year(-1) (one Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) has been stored in mangrove soils of the area. Mean whole-soil C stock in Khamir and Qeshm is 1076 and 2134 Mg C ha(-1), respectively. A total of 5181 Gg C and 201 Gg C is stored in the top 1 m of soil and mangrove trees, respectively, 76\% of which is sequestered in QM. Our results also indicate that mangroves located in desert and dryland coasts can store comparable quantities of belowground C than their tropical counterparts. High phytoplankton concentration and accreting mangrove high organic C content soils on their own accumulated peat in response to sea-level rise have possibly caused Khuran desert mangroves to store large amounts of C in their sediments. Our estimates suggest that probable complete deforestation of Khuran mangrove could lead to 8.14 Tg CO2 equivalent emissions.

AB  - In recent years, the offshore wind power industry has developed rapidly all over the world in response to the gradual depletion of fossil fuel energy sources and concerns over environmental issues. This rapid development is accompanied by high risks. Accidents involving offshore wind turbines (OWTs) are on the rise, and research on their risks has attracted increased attention. The supporting foundation plays a critical role in ensuring the stability and operational safety of OWTs; however, the risks of OWT foundations have not been taken seriously. Therefore, this paper reviews the main risks of various types of OWT foundations, with special attention to a promising new type of foundation, i.e. the suction bucket foundation. This paper also classifies and reviews the risk assessment methodologies of OWTs and analyses the characteristics and applicability of these methods. Finally, the challenges and future development trends in the risk analysis of OWT foundations are discussed. This paper aims to inform scholars and experts about the current status of OWT foundations and their corresponding risks, and to provide references for the risk management of OWT foundations.

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Low carbon renewable energy is required to support the energy transition away from hydrocarbons while meeting rising global energy demands. Geothermal energy is a proven system, capable of electricity production and direct heat, with over 95% availability. Normally geothermal energy requires a high geothermal gradient, however technological advances are improving the opportunities for deployment in lower gradient regions. In sedimentary basins the geothermal gradient is normally lower, however the presence of large salt deposits can provide localized regions with an increased gradient due to the unique characteristics of salt. Salt is able to mobilize and flow under suitable conditions, and form structures; it also has a thermal conductivity two to four times higher than clastics and carbonates. Therefore, sediments above salt structures are expected to have a higher geothermal gradient - positive temperature anomalies. This research focusses on assessing the geothermal potential associated with positive temperature anomalies above salt structures in selected areas of the Scotian and Maritime basins.

AB  - The â€œblue carbonâ€ concept and the role of blue carbon stored in shallow coastal ecosystems in mitigating climate change have attracted attention worldwide. In addition to typical blue carbon ecosystems, such as mangroves, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows, macroalgal beds and macroalgae farming are also gaining recognition as potential blue carbon sinks. Effective policies and methodologies are important for the conservation and expansion of blue carbon sinks, as well as the consequent reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). One of the most effective methods is carbon offset credit schemes. However, to date, almost all credit schemes have been implemented for mangroves and saltmarshes. None has been implemented for seagrass meadows, macroalgal beds, and macroalgae farming, although their CO2 uptake potentials are large. Here, we review three blue carbon offset credit projects for seagrass meadows, macroalgal beds, and macroalgae farming implemented in Japan. We show the blue carbon offset crediting projects of (1) Yokohama City, the first in the world; (2) Fukuoka City, the second such project in Japan; and (3) the first Japanese national governmental demonstration project. Furthermore, we highlight their characteristics by comparing them with the other blue carbon offset projects. Finally, we discuss the need to accelerate blue carbon offset credit projects and related initiatives in the future. Â© 2022 The Authors

AB  - Maritime industries are continuously in search of new opportunities to improve their environmental impact by eliminating air polluting and climate affecting emissions. Ships that can sail without producing any such local pollutants are referred to as zero-emission ships. In pursuit of enabling the breakthrough of such vessels smart combinations of fuel-cells, batteries and electric propulsion systems are needed to secure acceptable payloads, range and turn-around times. A Dutch FELMAR-consortium, consisting of Nedstack, MARIN, Damen Shipyards Group, Future Proof Shipping, Marine Service Noord and Holland Ship Electric, has been awarded a grant for the development of a new generation of fuel cell electric energy system for zero-emission ships. It has been revealed that electric and hybrid propulsion in the Dutch inland shipping sector is in an early phase and needs such joint efforts to realize the broader goal of reducing emissions.

JO  - World Journal Of Microbiology \& Biotechnology
PY  - 2019
VL  - 35
IS  - 5
AB  - Urbanization, industrialization, and natural earth processes have potentially increased the contamination of heavy metals (HMs) in water bodies. These HMs can accumulate in human beings through the consumption of contaminated water and food chains. Various clean-up technologies have been applied to sequester HMs, especially conventional methods including electrolytic technologies, ion exchange, precipitation, chemical extraction, hydrolysis, polymer micro-encapsulation, and leaching. However, most of these approaches are expensive for large-scale projects and require tedious control and constant monitoring, along with low efficiency for effective HMs removal. Algae offer an alternative, sustainable, and environmentally friendly HMs remediation approach. This review presents a state-of-the-art technology for potential use of algae as a low-cost biosorbent for the removal of HMs from wastewater. The mechanisms of HMs removal, including biosorption and bioaccumulation along with physical and chemical characterization of the algae are highlighted. The influence of abiotic factors on HMs removal and changes in algal biocomponents (including, carbohydrate, lipid, and protein) are discussed. Recent progresses made in the development of HMs-tolerant algal strains and the direction of future research toward the development of sustainable technology for advanced wastewater treatment and biomass production are covered.

TI  - Ubiquitous Gammaproteobacteria dominate dark carbon fixation in coastal sediments
JO  - Isme Journal
PY  - 2016
VL  - 10
IS  - 8
AB  - Marine sediments are the largest carbon sink on earth. Nearly half of dark carbon fixation in the oceans occurs in coastal sediments, but the microorganisms responsible are largely unknown. By integrating the 16S rRNA approach, single-cell genomics, metagenomics and transcriptomics with 14 C-carbon assimilation experiments, we show that uncultured Gammaproteobacteria account for 70-86% of dark carbon fixation in coastal sediments. First, we surveyed the bacterial 16S rRNA gene diversity of 13 tidal and sublittoral sediments across Europe and Australia to identify ubiquitous core groups of Gammaproteobacteria mainly affiliating with sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. These also accounted for a substantial fraction of the microbial community in anoxic, 490-cm-deep subsurface sediments. We then quantified dark carbon fixation by scintillography of specific microbial populations extracted and flow-sorted from sediments that were short-term incubated with 14 C-bicarbonate. We identified three distinct gammaproteobacterial clades covering diversity ranges on family to order level (the Acidiferrobacter, JTB255 and SSr clades) that made up >50% of dark carbon fixation in a tidal sediment. Consistent with these activity measurements, environmental transcripts of sulfur oxidation and carbon fixation genes mainly affiliated with those of sulfur-oxidizing Gammaproteobacteria. The co-localization of key genes of sulfur and hydrogen oxidation pathways and their expression in genomes of uncultured Gammaproteobacteria illustrates an unknown metabolic plasticity for sulfur oxidizers in marine sediments. Given their global distribution and high abundance, we propose that a stable assemblage of metabolically flexible Gammaproteobacteria drives important parts of marine carbon and sulfur cycles.

AB  - When selecting a suitable site for offshore wind farm, the impact on the marine environment is one of the most important issues. However, in most cases of the suitable sites selection, the distances from protected areas, spawning and wintering grounds of marine creatures are taken into account as environmental indicators, and there are few which explicitly consider the impact of the offshore wind farm on marine ecosystem including current field and water quality which could be affected by the construction of offshore power plants. In this study, the impacts of offshore wind farms on the flow field and water quality were investigated by numerical simulations, introducing models of offshore wind farms facilities and sessile organism on the structure into a three-dimensional coupled hydrodynamicecosystem models. A nesting grid system were employed which combines a farm-scale grid and a local-scale grid. The largescale simulation results showed that the changes in current due to a foundation structure of wind turbine could affect the flow field around the downstream structures. It is also found that water quality change in this scale is mainly caused by the changes in current field and the effects of sessile organisms on the structures are small. On the other hand, the small-scale results shows that the effects of sessile organisms may also appear in the very near vicinity of the structure. By using the developed model, it is possible to visualize the extent of the changes in currents and water quality caused by the offshore wind farm facilities. Â© 2022 by ASME.

JO  - Journal Of Environmental Management
PY  - 2018
VL  - 223
IS  - NA
AB  - Shipping emissions control is critical to air quality management and improved public health for coastal port cities and regions with heavy marine traffic. However, Asian port cities have been slow in introducing regulations on marine fuels for two main reasons - firstly, due to a lack of information and therefore appreciation on the air quality and public health benefits that could be derived; and secondly, due to sensitivity as to whether there may be negative impacts on port competitiveness and trade opposition. Hong Kong, one of the top-ten international container ports in the world, has been proactive in reducing shipping emissions in the past decade. The Ocean Going Vessels Fuel at Berth regulation, enforced since July 2015 in Hong Kong, is the first marine fuel control regulation for ocean going vessels in Asia. This regulation has been adopted nationally by China for its coastal ports, followed by the establishment of domestic emission control areas in its coastal waters that will come into force in 2019. This paper describes the decade-long journey where scientific research led to evidence-based policy changes. New insights and understanding arising from the research enabled cross-sectoral engagement and dialogue among the key stakeholders in government, industry and civil society, which resulted in the political consensus needed for a change in policy and legislation. Similar evidence-based policy formulation, together with public-private sectors dialogue could be useful to other jurisdictions in pursuing a ``win-win{''} path to improve environmental protection and public health through regulating shipping emissions. The same combination of science-to-engagement-to-policy approach could also become part of a knowledge-and-consensus-building process for other environmental policy areas as well.

TI  - MARITIME ENERGY CONTRACTING FOR CLEAN SHIPPING
JO  - Transport And Telecommunication Journal
PY  - 2018
VL  - 19
IS  - 1
AB  - To reduce the Sulphur emission from shipping and ensure clean shipping, a number of Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECA) were enforced in special areas around the globe. From 2015, in SECA, ship owners are not allowed to use fuel with more than 0.1\% Sulphur content. One of the major concerns for the SECA regulation is that maritime stakeholders have had to take into consideration the costs as well as the tolerable risks of their compliance investment options. Besides that, low freight rates have increased the competition and had caused financial pressure on ship owners so that lower capital reserves and low credibility levels limit the manoeuvring space for investment activities. The indications from BSR after 2015 showed that the low fuel price has eased the economic effects of the SECA regulation and as a result, most ship owners have delayed their investment decisions. Even though the postponement of emission abatement techniques seems to have reduced the compliance expenses for SECA, they, however, did not improve the position of shipowners relative to their competitors. Consequently, new policy instruments to stimulate innovation, to raise competitiveness and to comply with the new environmental regulations are needed. It would have been easier to hedge fuel price volatility and offer maritime logistics services for a lower price, but to be able to ensure sustainable results in long-term, maritime stakeholders must be ready to device astute strategies that can propel them to unparalleled advantage. This research first appraised the investment risks and payback period associated with the scrubber using different capital budgeting methods. It further illustrated the Maritime Energy Contracting (MEC) model as a market mechanism for the delivery of a cost-effective emission reduction using the scrubber technology as well as an instrument to realise a competitive advantage for ship operators. The results are empirically validated by case studies from BSR.

JO  - Forests
PY  - 2022
VL  - 13
IS  - 6
AB  - Mangroves are essential carbon reserves, and their role in carbon sequestration is remarkable. However, anthropogenic pressures such as aquaculture development threatened this highly susceptible ecosystem. Thus, the need to rehabilitate abandoned aquaculture ponds is a must to offset the ecological losses over the economic gains derived from these mangrove land-use changes. Thus, we chose a reforestation site of a once heavily utilized fishpond devastated by a tsunami in the late 1970s in Zamboanga del Sur, Philippines. We then established a similar study plot in a nearby natural mangrove forest as a point of reference. We determined the heterogeneity in vegetation and estimated the aboveground and soil carbon storage capacities. We also examined the distinct changes in species composition and zonation from the seaward towards the landward zones. About 30 years after the abandoned fishpond rehabilitation, we found the tree density of the Rhizopora mucronata Lamk. and Avicenia marina (Forsk.) Vierh-dominated reforestation site was higher (271 trees haâˆ’1) compared to that of the Rhizophora apiculata Blume-dominated natural stand (211 trees haâˆ’1) (p &lt; 0.05). The total aboveground biomass at the natural mangrove forest was 202.02 Mg haâˆ’1, which was close to that of the reforestation site (195.19 Mg haâˆ’1) (p &gt; 0.05). The total aboveground C in the natural mangrove forest was 90.52 Mg C haâˆ’1, while that of the reforestation site was 87.84 Mg C haâˆ’1 (p &gt; 0.05). Surprisingly, the overall soil C content at the natural forest of 249.85 Mg C haâˆ’1 was not significantly different from that of the reforestation site with 299.75 Mg C haâˆ’1 (p &gt; 0.05). There was an increasing soil C content trend as the soil got deeper from 0â€“100 cm (p &lt; 0.05). The zonation patterns established across the landward to seaward zones did not affect the aboveground and soil carbon estimates (p &gt; 0.05). Our study highlights the effectiveness of abandoned fishpond rehabilitation and calls for continuous restoration of the remaining abandoned aquaculture ponds in the country because of their ability to sequester and store carbon. Lastly, their potential to store huge amounts of carbon that will counterbalance anthropogenic CO2 emissions is likewise highlighted. Â© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The role of macroalgae in Blue Carbon assessments has been controversial, partially due to uncertainties about the fate of exported macroalgae. Available evidence suggests that macroalgae are exported to reach the open ocean and the deep sea. Nevertheless, this evidence lacks systematic assessment. Here, we provide robust evidence of macroalgal export beyond coastal habitats. We used metagenomes and metabarcodes from the global expeditions Tara Oceans and Malaspina 2010 Circumnavigation. We discovered macroalgae worldwide at up to 5,000 km from coastal areas. We found 24 orders, most of which belong to the phylum Rhodophyta. The diversity of macroalgae was similar across oceanic regions, although the assemblage composition differed. The South Atlantic Ocean presented the highest macroalgal diversity, whereas the Red Sea was the least diverse region. The abundance of macroalgae sequences attenuated exponentially with depth at a rate of 37.3\% km(-1), and only 24\% of macroalgae available at the surface were expected to reach the seafloor at a depth of 4,000 m. Our findings indicate that macroalgae are exported across the open and the deep ocean, suggesting that macroalgae may be an important source of allochthonous carbon, and their contribution should be considered in Blue Carbon assessments.

AB  - Amid growing concern about global warming, renewable energy sources are considered more important now. Energy is extracted from many renewable sources. Among this all, the ocean wave is one of the largest sources. Harvesting energy from this source has been one of the interesting and great challenges to researchers for many years. There are plenty of methods accepted to harvest electrical energy from sea waves. However, in reality, technical and economical intricacies are issues in harvesting energy from the ocean. Effective use and sustainability of wave energy converters (WECs) depend on competence in dealing with circumstances in maximum energy extraction, their configuration in the rough seasonal waves and addressing economic issues. This article gives a complete overview of WECs in comparison with all other ocean energy converters. It will help researchers to speed up their ongoing research on developing ocean WECs. The aim of this evaluation was to serve the information and describe the significance of ocean WECs. Another objective was to broaden the search of results gained in other fields in the WEC and to stimulate research on topics that have not been in the focus so far.

TI  - Nearshore tests of the tidal compensation system for point-absorbing wave energy converters
JO  - Energies
PY  - 2015
VL  - 8
IS  - 4
AB  - The power production of the linear generator wave energy converter developed at Uppsala University is affected by variations of mean sea level. The reason is that these variations change the distance between the point absorber located on the surface and the linear generator located on the seabed. This shifts the average position of the translator with respect to the center of the stator, thereby reducing the generator output power. A device mounted on the point absorber that compensates for tides of small range by regulating the length of the connection line between the buoy at the surface and the linear generator has been constructed and tested. This paper describes the electro-mechanical, measurement, communication and control systems installed on the buoy and shows the results obtained before its connection to the generator. The adjustment of the line was achieved through a linear actuator, which shortens the line during low tides and vice versa. The motor that drives the mechanical device was activated remotely via SMS. The measurement system that was mounted on the buoy consisted of current and voltage sensors, accelerometers, strain gauges and inductive and laser sensors. The data collected were transferred via Internet to a Dropbox server. As described within the paper, after the calibration of the sensors, the buoy was assembled and tested in the waters of Lysekil harbor, a few kilometers from the Uppsala University research site. Moreover, the performance of the sensors, the motion of the mechanical device, the power consumption, the current control strategy and the communication system are discussed. Â© 2015 by the authors.

TI  - Estimating fuel consumption in maritime transport
JO  - Journal Of Cleaner Production
PY  - 2020
VL  - 275
IS  - NA
AB  - Growth in technology has accelerated in the last few decades, and therefore demand for energy has dramatically increased. This has also brought about a major problem called global warming. The scarcity of resources, indeed, have been compelling us to sustain energy with the adoption of cleaner energy practices and alternative ways that can help us reduce energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. With the pressure due to increasing global environmental consciousness, the international shipping industry has thus been exposed to some challenges and energy-related problems it needs to wisely deal with. To reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gases, ship owners and operators need to find an efficient fuel economy with the control and alteration of some related factors. In this study, several determinants of fuel consumption in maritime transport were considered and alternative models were built employing the Response Surface Methodology using data obtained from the noon reports of a bulk carrier. Since the model building process is relatively tedious in the Response Surface Methodology, a guideline was also provided. The results indicate that as their speed increases up to a certain point, ships consume less fuel; however, after such a threshold, fuel consumption begins to increase. In addition, even though its main effect was found insignificant, revolution per minute's interaction with other inputs was found to affect the output. Thus, adopting the Response Surface Methodology, which allows for quadratic terms and higher order interactions, is critical to build a predictive model that performs well so that ship operators and shipping companies can make economic and environment-friendly decisions better. This study serves the literature by estimating the fuel consumptions of cargo ships using statistical models so that carbon dioxide emissions from fuel consumption can be estimated. Even though specific types of fuel and ships were considered, the approach adopted here can be extended and applied to other cases as long as there is accurate data. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Offshore renewable energy is a major potential source of electricity but survivability in extreme waves is a key design problem for floating platforms. Here we consider the multi-float wave energy converter (WEC) M4, a line absorber with three floats for this study and a hinge above mid float. This is modelled in focussed waves to represent extreme conditions using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) with wave basin comparison; power take off at the hinge is switched off. SPH is meshless and suited to steep, breaking waves and platform overtopping without special treatment. The open-source DualSPHysics code for fluid-structure interaction with project Chrono for mechanical constraints runs efficiently on inexpensive GPUs with many millions of particles. The versatility of the computational system is thus demonstrated for complex multi-floats with mechanical constraint and mooring (using MoorDyn library). The response measured in a wave basin is predicted well. This is the first application of DualSPHysics to such a complex offshore system. Â© 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

AB  - In this study, two types of artificial floating islands (AFIs), group A (consists of 1\# and 2\# traditional AFIs with plant and soil) and group B (consists of 4\# and 5\# new-type AFIs with plant, substrate, and with luffa sponge and corncob hanging at the bottom), were constructed, respectively. The removal effects and degradation mechanisms of luffa sponge and corncob in group B were compared and investigated. Plant height, root growth, and packing degradation of the two types of AFIs were studied. Temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH on the decontamination effects of AFI were discussed. The results showed that group A and group B AFIs showed great significant differences in removal of CODCr, TN, NO3--N, NH4+-N, and TP (p<0.05). The TP removal of group B was 92.8 +/- 0.6\%, and the TN removal and NO3--N removal were significantly higher than that of group A, which was 90.3 +/- 0.8\% and 96.0 +/- 2.2\%, respectively; The addition of luffa sponge and corncob could enhance the biodegradability of sewage and the nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiency of group B. The plant growth height of group B planted with Lythrum salicaria was 2.36 times higher than that of group A. The effect of temperature on TP was significantly greater than that of TN, and both groups of AFIs presented continuous improvement capacities of TN and TP removal when the temperature was above 15 degrees C. Group B was observed with a lower pH range of 6.69 similar to 7.12, which was more suitable for denitrification than group A. The release of carbon source of 5\#-corncob AFI was 2.51 times higher than 4\#-luffa sponge AFI at the end of the experiment.

VL  - NA

AB  - One of the major issues in the large-scale application of wind energy at sea, is the manner in which the generated power is to be brought onshore to the high-voltage grid. This issue needs to be resolved before the construction of several large-scale offshore wind farms can truly be realised, since the costs associated with the grid connection accounting for some 10% of the capital expenditure of a offshore wind farm. A study was commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs into the full range of aspects being considered in the context of developing an offshore electricity grid. The study project consisted of separate technical, legal and physical planning constituent surveys. These surveys have formed the basis for the considerations as to preferred options and their implications in terms of actions to be taken and responsibilities to be considered by the major stakeholders. This paper discusses the engineering alternatives available for bringing large volumes of offshore wind power on shore for connection to the high-voltage grid. Furthermore the question is addressed what should be done to enable the realisation of cable infrastructure for the benefit of developing offshore wind energy under the various technical alternatives and development scenarios. As for the minimisation of market intervention, the most obvious steering role for the government to adopt would be that of exercising control via the Public Works Act and the Electricity Supply Structure Scheme. The government could possibly assume a steering role by exercising control via the Electricity Act, with the TSO being designated as the party in charge of installation and operation of cables to offshore hub platforms. The government's plans for offshore wind have been unambiguously outlined for the period up to 2010. The findings presented in this paper should enable a start being made on the detailed elaboration of the various engineering, financial, spatial, environmental, legal and administrative aspects associated with possible large-scale offshore developments beyond 2010.

AB  - Mangroves are one of the most productive ecosystems of the world, that continually sequester organic carbon and play an important role in global carbon cycles and biogeochemieal processes. This study aimed to analyze carbon sequestration and below-ground carbon storage in mangroves, to provide a reference for carbon accounting in mangrove wetlands. The Gaoqiao mangrove area in the Zhanjiang Mangrove National Nature Reserve was chosen as the study area; 6 sediment cores were collected along two sample lines, which were perpendicular to the coastline, and the physical and chemical properties were examined. Based on the potassium diehromate oxidation-external heating method, the spatial distribution of below-ground organic carbon content in the sediment cores profile was analyzed. The burial rate of organic carbon was determined using radiometric dating 210Pb of the six sediment cores, organic carbon density, and depth ratio of mangrove wetlands were also analyzed. The results showed a below-ground organic carbon content of 2.14â€”36.94 g/kg, with an average of (12.79 Â± 9.91) g/kg. Below-ground organic carbon density in the mangroves was (0.0100 Â± 0.0056) g/cm3, and the spatial distribution of organic carbon density varied sharply. Horizontally, the peak of organic carbon density appeared at the middle zone, and organic carbon density at the landside was greater than that at the seaside. Vertically, the peak of organic carbon density appeared at the surface both at the landside and the seaside, while it was not clear at the middle zone, and that appeared stratification. In this study area, the century-scale sedimentation rate of mangroves soil was 6.5â€”11 mm/a, the sedimentation rate of the seaside was faster than that of the landside, and it was generally in accordance with the current rate of sea-level rise. Spatial distribution of organic carbon burial rate of the samples varied at different sites, which was affected by the tide level and plant community type. The burial rate of organic carbon at the seaside was (34.58Â±7.67) g m-2a-1, while that at the middle zone was 150.56 g m a. The distribution of soil organic carbon was affected by the tidal site in the mangrove wetland; organic carbon content and carbon density were higher at the higher tide site and at the surface, while the low tide site had a faster sediment rate. Below-ground organic carbon content and density at the study site were lower than those at lower latitudes, but higher than those in zonal terrestrial vegetation; thus, its potential for carbon sequestration was huge because of the continuous deposition process.

TI  - Can producing oil store carbon? greenhouse gas footprint of CO2EOR, offshore north sea
JO  - Environmental Science And Technology
PY  - 2015
VL  - 49
IS  - 9
AB  - Carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery (CO2EOR) is a proven and available technology used to produce incremental oil from depleted fields while permanently storing large tonnages of injected CO2. Although this technology has been used successfully onshore in North America and Europe, there are currently no CO2EOR projects in the United Kingdom. Here, we examine whether offshore CO2EOR can store more CO2 than onshore projects traditionally have and whether CO2 storage can offset additional emissions produced through offshore operations and incremental oil production. Using a high-level Life Cycle system approach, we find that the largest contribution to offshore emissions is from flaring or venting of reproduced CH4 and CO2. These can already be greatly reduced by regulation. If CO2 injection is continued after oil production has been optimized, then offshore CO2EOR has the potential to be carbon negative - even when emissions from refining, transport, and combustion of produced crude oil are included. The carbon intensity of oil produced can be just 0.056-0.062 tCO2e/bbl if flaring/venting is reduced by regulation. This compares against conventional Saudi oil 0.040 tCO2e/bbl or mined shale oil &gt;0.300 tCO2e/bbl. Â© 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Ship electric power system utilizes a standalone micro-grid during sailing and when in harbor, it uses the ground grid. To increase the sailing period without berthing on ports, more fuel should be stored onboard the ship which consumes part of the allowable onboard carrying mass and hence reduces the permissible payload especially in the commercial ships or reduces the allowable amount of weapon and ammunition in the naval ships. The above arises the need for shipbuilders to look for a solution to increase the sailing period. All-electric ship technique and renewable energy is a perfect solution to solve these problems and on the other hand to reduce the environmental restriction due to use the fossil fuel. In this paper, a pre-designed electric power system with fuel cell and storage devices is used in the emergency aircraft landing system. Ships have wide areas exposed to the sun. Photo-voltaic arrays were added to the system to adapt the fuel cell dynamic beside the storage energy system to enhance the electric power system performance and reduce the fuel consumption which in turn leads to minimize the cost for the commercial ship's applications and allow for more reliable long cursing for both commercial and military ships.

AB  - In the context of reducing emissions from the transport sector, the EU Commission envisions a strong modal shift to energy efficient modes including maritime shipping and inland shipping, as an alternative for road transport. In view of the expected growth of the sector, the emissions from waterborne transport are a key concern. When at berth, ships typically use their auxiliary engines to generate electrical power for communications, lighting, ventilation and other on-board equipment. The extended use of vessels' auxiliary engines augments greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air pollution in the adjacent ports, which are typically located in or near densely populated areas, thus leading to dangerous health and environmentaleffects. Shore Side Electricity (SSE) is an option for reducing the unwanted environmental impacts of ships at berth, i.e. GHG emissions, other air pollutants (NOx, SOx, PM) and noise of ships using their auxiliary engines. This paper quantifies the economic and environmental potential for SSE in Europe, through detailed estimation of in-port ships' emissions and relevant energy demand, providing an insight of the expected barriers for implementation and formulating recommendations on policy actions that could accelerate the implementation of SSE in European harbors.

AB  - Bathymetry measurements are needed in shallow, near-shore environments to estimate the potential distribution of macroalgae and seagrass, which contribute to oceanic carbon sinks in Greenland and other Arctic locations. Additionally, ocean current observations near icebergs and marine-terminating glaciers are necessary to estimate their melt rates. Rocky coastlines, icebergs and glaciers, however, present a significant safety risk to manned vessels. We developed an affordable and portable autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) that can safely obtain bathymetry and ocean current measurements in dangerous environments. The Arctic Research Centre Autonomous Boat (ARCAB) is a student-built ASV that can be transported on a euro-pallet and operated from a small boat and from shore. ARCAB has a minimum battery life of 2 h and accommodates a SonTek M9 RiverSurveyor system for bathymetry and ocean current measurements. ARCAB is controlled by a National Instruments myRIO-1900 and features autonomous waypoint navigation, obstacle avoidance, and return-to-home functionality. We demonstrate the use of ARCAB in Greenland in January 2019. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Due to the more stringent regulations on pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions in the maritime transport sector, solutions are being sought to reduce or avoid the emissions generated during the operation of ships. The onboard installation of hydrogen-fuelled fuel cells is a solution respectful with the environment and the marine ecosystem through which ships navigate. In this work, the design of a wellboat and its power plant based on fuel cells fed with hydrogen and hybridised with batteries is conducted, making it a zero-emissions ship that can navigate Emission Control Areas (ECAs). The fuel cells used are polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), and the hydrogen they consume is stored in tanks pressurised at 35 MPa, grouping these tanks into three standard containers (Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units) installed on an exposed deck. The electrical and propulsion needs of the ship are covered by the installed power plant, providing an average power of 1266 kW and a peak power of 2624 kW, making it possible to avoid the emission of 10.8 t of CO2, 195 kg of NOx and 9 kg of SOx per 14 h mission.

AB  - New environmental regulations are mandating cleaner fuels and lower emissions from all maritime operations. Natural gas (NG) is a fuel that enables mariners to meet regulations; however, emissions data from maritime operations with natural gas is limited. We measured emissions of criteria, toxic and greenhouse pollutants from a dual-fuel marine engine running either on diesel fuel or NG as well as engine activity and analyzed the impacts on pollutants, health, and climate change. Results showed that particulate matter (PM), black carbon (BC), nitric oxides (NOx), and carbon dioxide (CO2) were reduced by about 93\%, 97\%, 92\%, and 18\%, respectively when switching from diesel to NG. Reductions of this magnitude provide a valuable tool for the many port communities struggling with meeting air quality standards. While these pollutants were reduced, formaldehyde (HCHO), carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH4) increased several-fold. A health risk assessment of exhaust plume focused on when the vessel was stationary, and at-berth showed the diesel plume increased long-term health risk and the NG plume increased short-term health risk. An analysis of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and BC was performed and revealed that, on a hundred year basis, the whole fuel cycle global warming potential (GWP) per kWh including well-to-tank and exhaust was 50\% to few times higher than that of diesel at lower engine loads, but that it was similar at 75\% load and lower at higher loads. Mitigation strategies for further reducing pollutants from NG exhaust are discussed and showed potential for reducing short-term health risks and climate impacts. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Following the OCMIP carbon sequestration protocol, we carried out a series of carbon injection simulations. The ISAM results show that warming over the next 500 years under the IPCC S650 and WRE1000 stabilization scenarios could change the ocean circulation and thereby increases the residence time of CO2 disposed into the deep ocean, particularly for Atlantic injection. However, the warming does not have a significant effect on carbon injections into the Pacific and Indian Oceans, where circulation change is small. This new finding contrasts with previous OGCM results. Copyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.

JO  - Ocean Engineering
PY  - 2022

AB  - Offshore electrical platform plays an important role in gathering and transmitting the electric energy of offshore wind turbines. Various published works have studied the seismic performance of offshore platforms but these investigations are usually focused on the platforms and much less on the electrical equipment arranged on them. The electrical equipment is the nonstructural component on platform and is prone to failure and damage in the complex marine environment, causing the offshore electrical platform to lose its functionality. This paper aimed to fill in the knowledge gap in the study of the floor acceleration response spectra of offshore electrical platform. The finite element models of offshore electrical platforms were firstly established considering hydrodynamic effects and pile-soil-structure interaction. The influencing factors associated with the generation of platform floor acceleration response spectra were discussed under sea waves and earthquake. The empirical fitted formulas of platform floor acceleration response spectra were proposed to estimate fast and accurately the maximum absolute acceleration of electrical equipment. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed formulas was validated by comparing with the results calculated by time history analyses. The conclusions of this paper can be utilized in engineering practice to improve seismic design of offshore electrical equipment and decrease environmental loads damages to it. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

IS  - NA
AB  - Far-from-equilibrium batch experiments have been performed to study the low temperature dissolution potential of crystalline submarine basalts (from Juan de Fuca Plate and Mid-Atlantic Ridges) and of a highly altered gabbro from the Troodos ophiolite (Cyprus) in presence of seawater and carbon dioxide (CO2). The experiments have been carried out at 40 degrees C for up to 20 days with initial pH of similar to 4.8 and under similar to 1 bar pCO(2) to identify the progressive water-rock interactions. Elemental steady-state release rates from the rock samples have been determined for silicon and calcium, the solution concentrations of which were found to be the most effective monitors of rock dissolution. Mass balance calculations based on dissolved Si and Ca concentrations suggest the operation of reaction mechanisms focussed on the grain surfaces that are characteristic of incongruent dissolution. Also, basic kinetic modelling highlights the role of mass-transport limitations during the experiments. Ca release rates at pH similar to 5 indicate significant contributions of plagioclase dissolution in all the rocks, with an additional contribution of amphibole dissolution in the altered gabbro. Si release rates of all solids are found to be similar to previously studied reactions between seawater and basaltic glass and crystalline basalt from Iceland, but are higher than rates measured for groundwater-crystalline basalt interaction systems. This comparison with previous experimental results resumes the debate on the role of experimental variables, such initial rock mass and crystallinity, pCO(2), and fluid chemistry on dissolution processes. Our new data suggest that CO2-rich saline solutions react with mafic rocks at higher rates than fresh water with low pCO(2), at the same pH. Most significantly, both ophiolitic gabbro and Juan de Fuca basalts show Si and Ca release rates similar or higher than unaltered crystalline basalt from Iceland, highlighting the potential substantial role that ophiolitic rocks and offshore mafic reservoirs could play for the geological storage of CO2.

AB  - Maritime transport plays a central role in the debate about the sustainability of the transport sector. Analyses suggest that air emissions from shipping account for a significant portion of total emissions, affect air quality, and contribute to climate change and human health problems. The existing trend suggests that the situation will worsen. These results, though affected by obvious uncertainties, highlight the urgent need to take action. Harmful environmental impacts are controlled primarily through legislation prohibiting the use of certain substances, setting limits on emissions, and enforcing certain technical standards. However, the basis for designing effective policy instruments to abate air emissions is finding reliable estimates of those emissions. For the shipping sector, a debate continues about the most appropriate way to achieve its air emissions estimate. This paper contributes to this debate by proposing a new methodology that applies some of the available theories from the naval design scientific field to derive a microscopic analytical formulation of the energy produced and consumed by a ship during its trips. The methodology proposed is applied to evaluations of potential savings in energy and emissions by adjusting the speed-acceleration profile of ships in port. Results achieved confirm the power of the methodology and open its application to other case studies. They also highlight an aspect usually neglected in the literature: the impact of ships' activities in port on the environment. The simple exercises performed show clearly the relevance of the issue. They are also able to show that better management of ships' movements in port may produce significant environmental benefits.

AB  - <list list-type={''}1{''} id={''}jpe12207-list-0001{''}> Offshore renewable energy provides an increasing component of our electricity supply. We have limited understanding of the potential environmental impacts of these developments, particularly in the move to larger scales. Surfaces provided by devices offer novel habitat to marine organisms, which may allow species to spread to new areas. We used coupled biological and hydrodynamic models to investigate the spread of intertidal marine organisms with pelagic larvae (such as barnacles or gastropods) in the region around south-western Scotland. We assessed the impact of novel habitat on dispersal and its role in allowing transgression of physical barriers. Model renewable energy device sites provided habitat for pelagic larval particles that would otherwise have been lost offshore. They also provided a source of larvae for existing coastal sites. Many offshore devices fulfilled source and destination (or intermediate connection) roles, creating new dispersal pathways, and allowing previously impossible northward dispersal from the Northern Irish coast to Scotland.Synthesis and applications. New habitat close to biogeographical barriers has implications for existing species' distributions and genetic population structure. It also affects the spread of non-native species and climate migrants'. Monitoring these sites for the presence of such species will be important in determining the future ecology of coastal habitat and in maintaining economic aquaculture and marina operations. Future model studies should focus on particular species of importance, taking account of their biology and current distribution.

AB  - Permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) based offshore wind farm is connected to the onshore grid by voltage source converter (VSC) HVDC link. The wind farm side VSC controls the AC voltage, and grid side VSC controls the reactive power and DC link voltage. This paper presents a non-linear control method for improving the robustness of the controller for VSC-HVDC link. A hybrid controller is designed using sliding mode control (SMC) and proportional-integral (PI) control. Mathematical modeling of the hybrid controller is presented. This hybrid controller has the capability of Fault Ride Through and transient stability of VSC-HVDC link. This hybrid controller is simulated using the MATLAB/Simulink software and it is observed that the controller provides better performance. Transient stability is ensured by creating a symmetrical fault at the grid side in the simulation.

TI  - Carbon emissions from a temperate coastal peatland wildfire: contributions from natural plant communities and organic soils
JO  - Carbon Balance And Management
PY  - 2021
VL  - 16
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: One of the scientific challenges of understanding climate change has been determining the important drivers and metrics of global carbon (C) emissions and C cycling in tropical, subtropical, boreal, subarctic, and temperate peatlands. Peatlands account for 3% of global land cover, yet contain a major reservoir of 550 gigatons (Gt) of soil C, and serve as C sinks for 0.37 Gt of carbon dioxide (CO2) a year. In the United States, temperate peatlands are estimated to store 455 petagrams of C (PgC). There has been increasing interest in the role of wildfires in C cycling and altering peatlands from C sinks to major C sources. We estimated above- and below-ground C emissions from the Pains Bay Fire, a long-duration wildfire (112Â days; 18,329Â ha) that burned a coastal peatland in eastern North Carolina, USA. Results: Soil C emissions were estimated from pre- and post-burn Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) soil elevation data, soils series and C content mapping, remotely sensed soil burn severity, and post-burn field surveys of soil elevation. Total above-ground C emissions from the fire were 2,89,579Â tÂ C and 214Â tÂ CÂ haâˆ’1 for the 10 vegetation associations within the burn area perimeter. Above-ground sources of C emissions were comprised of litter (69,656Â tÂ C), shrub (1,68,983Â tÂ C), and foliage (50,940Â tÂ C). Total mean below-ground C emissions were 5,237,521Â tÂ C, and ranged from 2,630,529 to 8,287,900Â tÂ C, depending on organic matter content of different soil horizons within each of the 7 soil series. The mean below-ground C emissions within the burn area were 1,595.6Â tÂ CÂ haâˆ’1 and ranged from 629.3 to 2511.3Â tÂ CÂ haâˆ’1. Conclusions: In contrast to undisturbed temperate peatlands, human induced disturbances of the natural elevation gradient of the peatland has resulted in increased heterogeneity of floristic variation and assemblages that are a product of the spatial and temporal patterns of the water table level and the surface wetness across peatlands. Human induced changes in surface hydrology and land use influenced the fuel characteristics of natural vegetation and associated soils, thus influencing wildfire risk, behavior, and the resulting C emissions.

JO  - NANA

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Based on engineering background of direct disposal of liquid CO2 into the ocean by a moving ship, a numerical model is developed to simulate and predict the physicochemical dynamics of LCO2 droplets and CO2 enriched seawater in the ocean. This is a hybrid model consisting of a 3-D small-scale near-field model and a 2-D horizontal turbulent dispersion model. The double-plume fort-nation, interaction, evolution, and coupling with ocean current, are described by using two-fluid large-eddy simulation technology. The further development Of CO2 enriched seawater, as a passive-inert scalar, in relative larger space and time scales (28x28 km and up to 100 hours) is then simulated by the horizontal turbulent dispersion model. For case of LCO2 releasing at depth of 2200m with mass flow rate of 100kg/sec, initial droplet diameter of 8.0mm, and ship speed of 3.0m/sec, modeling results predicted that it produces a locally minimum pH of 6.20 associated wit the CO2 concentration of 0.18 kg/m(3), a vertically separated CO2 enriched seawater plume with 330m. in height and 40m in wide at time about one hour after releasing. This CO2 enriched seawater plume converted and diffused turbulently in horizontal surface to an area in horizontal of 9.8 x 10.5 km(2) in 100 hours later.

This presentation discusses the important aspects of energy transition, of automation and of digitalization that the maritime transportation sector is facing. The pressures of transition to carbon free environment leads to pressures for improving the energy efficiency of ship operation and to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions. This will be achieved by improved technologies and alternative forms as will be presented. The evolution of automation is also discussed as well as the impacts and the problems related with the digitalization in the shipping industry. Â© 2023 the Author(s).

TI  - Effects of Spartina invasion on the soil organic carbon content in salt marsh and mangrove ecosystems in China
JO  - Journal Of Applied Ecology
PY  - 2022
VL  - 59
IS  - 7
AB  - Coastal wetlands are large reservoirs of soil carbon (C) and have been invaded globally by the exotic species Spartina alterniflora. However, the effects of these invasions on soil C content remain unclear. We performed a meta-analysis of 2479 soil organic C (SOC) content observations collected from 91 field studies conducted in coastal China, the world's largest introduced range for S. alterniflora. Spartina alterniflora invasions had no significant effect on the SOC content in vegetated native wetlands in coastal China. S. alterniflora increased the SOC content in the top 30 cm of salt marshes after invading only one of the nine marsh types, which was dominated by a dwarf succulent species, Suaeda salsa in the northern subtropics and decreased the SOC content in the top 60 cm of mangroves dominated by Kandelia obovata and mixed communities after invasion in the southern subtropics. S. alterniflora invasions did not significantly affect the SOC content in the other salt marsh or mangrove ecosystems. Moreover, the SOC content in S. alterniflora-invaded ecosystems increased only on a decadal scale and then decreased, rather than increasing monotonically. Synthesis and applications. Our findings reveal that the SOC content of S. alterniflora-invaded ecosystems is similar to or lower than that of most native ecosystems. As soil bulk density is often reduced by S. alterniflora invasions, the C storage capabilities of vegetated native ecosystems might be substantially reduced after S. alterniflora invasions. Moreover, the SOC content in these invaded ecosystems gradually decreased after long-term S. alterniflora invasions (>20 years). Therefore, the displacement of native salt marsh or mangrove species by S. alterniflora may not be considered a natural climate solution to increase the C sink in coastal China. Future efforts are required to control S. alterniflora preferentially in coastal wetlands where S. alterniflora invasions do not increase the SOC content, and to conserve and restore native coastal wetlands, which are the core areas of the World Natural Heritage site serving as China's Migratory Bird Sanctuaries that have been severely threatened by S. alterniflora invasions, to increase ecological integrity and C sinks and to mitigate climate change.

TI  - Identifying Scaling Pathways and Research Priorities for Kelp Aquaculture Nurseries Using a Techno-Economic Modeling Approach
JO  - Frontiers In Marine Science
PY  - 2022
VL  - 9
IS  - NA
AB  - Aquaculture of seaweeds, particularly in emerging farming regions such as North America, Europe, and South America, is steadily increasing. The growth of the sector has been supported by public and private R&D investment with the long-term goal of reducing farm-gate production costs. Reducing expenses would potentially allow growers to target high volume, low value markets, such as hydrocolloids, animal feeds, food thickening agents, biofuels, and carbon dioxide removal (CDR), as well as the higher value, â€œwhole foodsâ€ markets. Regardless of the eventual fate of farmed seaweed, nursery production must increase in parallel with ocean cultivation to support the raw materials needs of the expanding industry. We quantified S. latissima (hereafter kelp) nursery production costs and identified potential barriers to cost-effective scaling using a techno-economic model (TEM). Semi-structured interviews with nursery operators in the U.S. and Europe were supplemented by an extensive literature review to parameterize the TEM. Reducing the sporophyte grow-out duration, increasing labor capacity, de-risking energy efficient flow-through systems, and optimizing tank and PVC â€œspoolâ€ size emerged as the most important research priorities based on our analysis. We point towards expanded gametophyte culture, and an associated policy framework to protect wild kelp population structure from monocultures, as necessary elements to support these potential improvements. The results of this work, as well as the open-source nursery TEM, are relevant to seaweed aquaculture producers, policy makers, and researchers, and can be used to guide future decision making regarding the cost-benefit of best available nursery technology.

TI  - Green Solution for Insulation System of a Medium Frequency High Voltage Transformer for an Offshore Wind Farm
JO  - Energies
PY  - 2022
VL  - 15
IS  - 6
AB  - High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission represents the most efficient way for transporting produced electrical energy from remotely located offshore wind farms to the shore. Such systems are implemented today using very expensive and large power transformers and converter stations placed on dedicated platforms. The present study aims at elaborating a compact solution for an energy collections system. The solution allows for a minimum of total transformer weight in the wind turbine nacelle reducing or even eliminating the need for a sea-based platform(s). The heart of the project is a Medium Frequency Transformer (MFT) that has a high DC voltage insulation towards ground. The transformer is employed in a DC/DC converter that delivers the energy into a serial array without additional conversion units. The insulation design methodology of an environmentally friendly HV insulation system for an MFT, based on pressboard and biodegradable oil, is introduced. The measurement method and results of the measurements of electrical conductivities of the transformer oil and Oil Impregnated Pressboard (OIP) are reported. The measurements show that the biodegradable ester oil/OIP conductivities are generally higher than the mineral oil/OIP conductivities. Numerical simulations reveal that the performance of the insulation system is slightly better when ester oil is used. Additionally, a lower temperature dependency for ester oil/OIP conductivities is observed, with the result that the transformer filled with ester oil is less sensitive to temperature variations.

AB  - Part of the answer to rising energy needs and costs may literally be blowing in the wind. Among sustainable sources of electricity, only wind energy has the capacity and technology needed to compete in the open marketplace. The largest onshore wind farm in Europe is being built in Scotland, the largest in the USA is planned for southern California, and the biggest offshore wind farm production in the world is slated for the Thames Estuary. But wind is intermittent. Marc Genton and Amanda Hering explain how advanced statistical techniques will enable wind energy to be more efficiently incorporated into the electrical grid.

JO  - Wetlands
PY  - 2018
VL  - 38

AB  - Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from natural sources have received a considerable attention for the past decade due to their considerable effects on global warming and climate change. Of many natural GHG sources, wetland plays a crucial role in modulating the atmospheric GHGs. This study aims to continuously monitor the emission/uptake of GHGs from an estuarine mangroves in summer August at Southeastern China (23 degrees 5345.32N, 117 degrees 2407.61E). A self-designed open dynamic floating chamber was applied to collect air samples for continuously measuring GHG concentration in-situ with a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) monitor. Diurnal emission of GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N2O) from the mangroves, the mudflats, and the river water was characterized by considering tidal and solar radiation effects. This study also investigated the seasonal variation of GHG emission and estimated their overall CO2 equivalent (CO2-e). The GHG emission was further correlated with water quality to identify which water quality parameters dominated GHG emission in the estuarine mangroves. A positive correlation was found between CO2 emission and water temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), and total phosphorus (TP) in water. The emission of CH4 positively correlated with TP, DO, and NH4-N. The emission of N2O was significantly positively correlated with DO, TP, and total nitrogen (TN) in water. This study revealed that N2O was the dominant contributor to the global warming effect in the subtropical estuarine mangroves while compared to CO2 and CH4.

AB  - This study investigates conditions under which differentiating port fees based on vessels' environmental performance could be an additional driver for cruise-ship owners to invest in green technologies. Our case study on liquefied natural gas (LNG) as fuel for a cruise ship shows that port-based incentives could help reduce emissions to air and drive uptake of green technologies. Assuming an average rebate of EUR 1500 per port visit, the accumulated rebates globally for our case study ship exceed EUR 400,000 per year. Applying a rebate of nearly EUR 4800 per visit as currently offered in Norwegian ports, and assuming 50\% of ports globally adopt the scheme, gives a cost benefit of EUR 700,000 per year, reducing the LNG technology payback time up to one year. Our case study also shows that significantly reducing ship emissions in ports will bring social benefits through reduced risks of loss of life, health and wellbeing.

JO  - South African Journal Of Botany
PY  - 2019
VL  - 127
IS  - NA
AB  - Mangroves and salt marshes are globally recognized for their ability to efficiently sequester and store carbon in biomass and soil carbon pools. An increase in soil carbon has been found at range limits where mangroves are expanding along ecotones into salt marsh, as mangroves store more carbon per unit area. However, the magnitude of this trend is variable at different mangrove range limits depending on the rates of expansion and the local climatic and geomorphological factors that influence current mangrove distribution. This study presents the first account of soil carbon storage across a mangrove-salt marsh ecotone at the Nahoon Estuary, a warm-temperate range limit for the east coast of the African continent. Soil carbon (to 50 cm depth) was compared between mangrove, salt marsh, and a transitional ecotone habitat. We found that soil carbon was highest at 30-50 cm below the surface across all habitats. The average soil carbon in the upper 50 cm was similar in mangrove (110.14 MgC.ha(-1)), ecotone (114.50 MgC.ha(-1)), and salt marsh habitats (109.62 MgC. ha(-1)). These results show that although mangroves have expanded at the Nahoon Estuary over the past 50 years, the soil carbon content is still similar across the mangrove-salt marsh ecotone. This is in contrast to other studies from southern hemisphere mangrove range limits in Australia. However, these trends have been reported at northern hemisphere range limits in the USA. Further studies in this region are needed to identify environmental factors influencing soil carbon variability. (C) 2019 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - For developing an OWC device to capture wave energy efficiently, it is important to investigate its hydrodynamic performance and even could do some amelioration. To against a large wave force on OWC device as storm wave impacts, Tsai (2016) proposed an improved OWC device which is installed by a nonconventional wave damping structure in front of OWC chamber. The improved OWC was purposed to not only reduce the wave force impact but also promote the wave energy capture. This study conducted preliminary experiments in a wave flume to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the improved OWC, including the wave pressure on the front wall of OWC chamber, the oscillating water column profile, and the airflow velocity generating by OWC. The experimental results showed that the improved OWC has better hydrodynamic performance than the conventional OWC and a U-shaped OWC.

AB  - The development of offshore wind farms commenced in shallow water areas with the fixed (seabed mounted) structures. However, countries with limited shallow water areas, requires innovative floating platforms to deploy wind turbines offshore to harness wind energy in deep sea. The hydrodynamic interaction of such platforms with ocean waves and the understanding and quantification of the non linearity involved in these interactions is of vital importance while designing a cost effective and durable floating platform. This paper describes a numerical time domain modeling developed to simulate dynamic behavior of the TLP type floating offshore wind turbine system. The effect of change in platform configuration on its dynamic response under wave loading has been examined in detail. A limited comparison of the numerical, results with the experimental data is also presented, showing acceptable accuracy of the model.

TI  - Wake properties and power output of very large wind farms for different meteorological conditions and turbine spacings: A large-eddy simulation case study for the German Bight
JO  - Wind Energy Science
PY  - 2022
VL  - 7
IS  - 2
AB  - Germany's expansion target for offshore wind power capacity of 40 GW by the year 2040 can only be reached if large portions of the Exclusive Economic Zone in the German Bight are equipped with wind farms. Because these wind farm clusters will be much larger than existing wind farms, it is unknown how they will affect the boundary layer flow and how much power they will produce. The objective of this large-eddy simulation study is to investigate the wake properties and the power output of very large potential wind farms in the German Bight for different turbine spacings, stabilities and boundary layer heights. The results show that very large wind farms cause flow effects that small wind farms do not. These effects include, but are not limited to, inversion layer displacement, counterclockwise flow deflection inside the boundary layer and clockwise flow deflection above the boundary layer. Wakes of very large wind farms are longer for shallower boundary layers and smaller turbine spacings, reaching values of more than 100 km. The wake in terms of turbulence intensity is approximately 20 km long, in which longer wakes occur for convective boundary layers and shorter wakes for stable boundary layers. Very large wind farms in a shallow, stable boundary layer can excite gravity waves in the overlying free atmosphere, resulting in significant flow blockage. The power output of very large wind farms is higher for thicker boundary layers because thick boundary layers contain more kinetic energy than thin boundary layers. The power density of the energy input by the geostrophic pressure gradient limits the power output of very large wind farms. Because this power density is very low (approximately 2 W m-2), the installed power density of very large wind farms should be small to achieve a good wind farm efficiency. Â© 2022 Oliver Maas.

AB  - This paper presents the computational models used by the authors at MARETEC/IST for hydrodynamic design and analysis of horizontal axis marine current turbines. The models combine a lifting line method for the optimization of the turbine blade geometry and an Integral Boundary Element Method (IBEM) for the hydrodynamic analysis. The classical lifting line optimization is used to determine the optimum blade circulation distribution for maximum power extraction. Blade geometry is determined with simplified cavitation requirements and limitations due to mechanical strength. The application of the design procedure is illustrated for a two-bladed 300 kW marine current turbine with a diameter of 11 meters. The effects of design tipspeedratio and the influence of blade section foils on power and cavitation inception are discussed. A more complete analysis may be carried out with an IBEM in steady and unsteady flow conditions. The IBEM has been extended to include wake alignment. The results are compared with experimental performance data available in the literature. Copyright Â© 2011 by ASME.

TI  - An approach and discussion of a simulation based measurement uncertainty estimation for a floating lidar system
JO  - Journal Of Physics: Conference Series
PY  - 2022
VL  - 2265
IS  - 2
AB  - In recent years, floating lidar systems (FLS) have been used in increasing numbers for project planning and design of offshore wind farm projects. To assess the quality of the measured data or the wind resources, an exact knowledge of the measurement uncertainty of the FLS is important. However, this is difficult because there is usually no reference measurement system at the offshore sites where FLSs are to be used to assess wind resources. In order to estimate the quality of the measurements or the measurement uncertainty for a site without a reference measurement system, in this case only measurement uncertainties from measurement campaigns or trial campaigns that have already been carried out can be used. However, the respective wind and wave conditions differ from location to location. In this respect, a direct transfer of the measurement uncertainty from one measurement location to another location is again subject to a certain uncertainty. In this paper, we explore the possibilities of a different, simulation-based, approach. First, we discuss which parts of the measurement uncertainty of the FLS can be investigated in the context of simulations. Additionally, we present a workflow for the simulation of an FLS for different wind and wave conditions and an approach to determine and compare the simulated bin-averaged deviations for these conditions with real measurement data. Finally, we show a comparison of the simulated uncertainties with measurement uncertainties determined during a six-month measurement campaign of an FLS against an offshore measurement mast and a fixed reference lidar and give an outlook on possible further use cases of this simulation-based methodology.

AB  - A pilot project was launched to monitor vessel performance and to explore ways to reduce fuel consumption. A prototype Vessel Performance Monitoring and Analysis System (VPMAS) was used to collect information over a three week period. The project objective was to collect needed data, conduct preliminary analysis to establish trends, explore key performance indicators (KPI) to establish baseline, and explore data products for performance management. Performance management includes improving vessel performance and supporting efficient operation to reduce fuel consumption. For the pilot project, only a subset of vessel performance data was collected. Current key performance indicators (KPIs) include fuel consumption per trip, fuel consumption per distance travelled, fuel consumption per displacement distance and fuel consumption per payload distance. The dataset will expand in the future and will include the effect of environmental conditions. Preliminary analysis includes comparing the normal route for calm sea states and irregular routes taken probably to avoid heavy sea states; assessing the maneuvers in and out of harbors, computing key performance indicators, assessing the data trends and general statistics, and identifying data products to support performance management. Initial results show that automatic fuel measurement was in good agreement with manual tank sounding. A voyage on an irregular route consumed almost twice the amount of fuel consumed in a normal route. Fuel consumption would be reduced if constant speed is used in open water and if deviations from the desired routes could be minimized, for example, through optimized autopilot.

AB  - During the last 10 years the liberalisation of the energy market in Europe has changed the rules for major investment decisions in the electricity market. At the same time there are considerable political efforts to increase the percentage of renewable energy sources in power production. Wind energy has become an important source of renewable energy, and has grown to become the second largest renewable energy source worldwide after hydro power. In some countries wind power has even become as important as hydro. Recent developments in tidal power and wave power will bring a further increase of renewable energy sources in certain regions of Europe. The increase of wind energy in the national electricity grids leads to new tasks with respect to grid stability and stability of power supply. This is due to the stochastic nature of wind energy. There are several means to deal with the intermittency of wind energy: forecasting of wind, overall balancing within a large grid with high transmission capacities, balancing of the grid with thermal power and hydro power stations and storage of energy in pumped storage plants.

VL  - 5-A
IS  - NA
AB  - Due to the growing rate of energy consumption and its consequent emissions, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has devised strict rules for an extensive reduction in Greenhouse Emissions (GHG), which forces the shipping industry to search for more energy-efficient solutions. Therefore, alongside with the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), improving the energy efficiency of existing ships under the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) is of considerable importance. This paper address this issue by proposing a digital twin framework supported by big data analytics for ship performance monitoring. The proposed framework is developed by the respective data sets from a selected vessel. For this purpose, a cluster analysis is implemented using the Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. By this approach, the most frequent operating regions of the engine is detected, the shapes of these frequent operating regions are captured, and the relationships between different navigation and performance parameters of the engine are determined. That will make the basis for a digital twin application in shipping. The main objective of this research study is to develop a digital twin of a marine engine by considering the engine operational conditions that can be utilized toward green ship operations. The contribution of this paper and the outcomes can facilitate the shipping industry to meet the IMO requirements enforced by its regulations. Copyright Â© 2022 by ASME.

AB  - Industrial wastewater treatment is of paramount importance considering the safety of the aquatic ecosystem and its associated health risk to humankind inhabiting near the water bodies. Microalgae-based technologies for remediation of environmental pollutants present avenues for bioenergy applications and production of value-added biochemicals having pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, antioxidants, carbohydrate, phenolics, long-chain multi-faceted fatty acids, enzymes, and proteins which are considered healthy supplements for human health. Such a wide range of products put up a good case for the biorefinery concept. Microalgae play a pivotal role in degrading complex pollutants, such as organic and inorganic contaminants thereby efficiently removing them from the environment. In addition, microalgal species, such as Botryococcus braunii, Tetraselmis suecica, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Neochloris oleoabundans, Chlorella vulgaris, Arthrospira, Chlorella, and Tetraselmis sp., etc., are also reported for generation of value-added products. This review presents a holistic view of microalgae based biorefinery starting from cultivation and harvesting of microalgae, the potential for remediation of environmental pollutants, bioenergy application, and production of value-added biomolecules. Further, it summarizes the current understanding of microalgae-based technologies and discusses the risks involved, potential for bioeconomy, and outlines future research directions.

AB  - Effective utilization of potential renewable energy sources is part of the overall endeavour to achieve sustainable national development target and therefore, Indonesia should continue to conduct R&D and experiment with renewable energy technology which could fit into the Long Range National Development strategy and goals. As our fossil fuel particularly oil will be exhausted in the next 10 to 20 years, the role of renewable energy will become more dominant as one of the best alternative substitution, due to its potential availability all over the country and environmental friendliness. Indonesian renewable energy potential was estimated to reach 77 GWe, comprising of energy derived from geothermal, biomass, small hydro, solar, wind and ocean energy sources. New renewable energy projects are now under way, covering a wide range of renewable energy technology from biomass, using gasifications process of rice husks, empty oil palm fruit bunches and municipal wastes, extraction of bio-fuels from exotic plants such as Jatropha curcas , Ricinus Communis. L.(Castor oil), small hydro, solar photovoltaic and solar thermal. These projects are expected to boost rural industrialization, particularly in regions outside the Island of Java where around 48% of rural area are mostly un-electrified and access to commercial energy sources is lacking. These projects can be integrated with processing industries both in rural and urban areas to create more job opportunities with cleaner production practices. Â© 2006 AAAE.

JO  - Global Biogeochemical Cycles
PY  - 2003
VL  - 17
IS  - 2
AB  - Increasing oceanic productivity by fertilizing nutrient-rich regions with iron has been proposed as a mechanism to offset anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide. Earlier studies examined the impact of large-scale fertilization of vast reaches of the ocean for long periods of time. We use an ocean general circulation model to consider more realistic scenarios involving fertilizing small regions (a few hundred kilometers on a side) for limited periods of time (of order 1 month). A century after such a fertilization event, the reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide is between 2\% and 44\% of the initial pulse of organic carbon export to the abyssal ocean. The fraction depends on how rapidly the surface nutrient and carbon fields recover from the fertilization event. The modeled recovery is very sensitive to the representation of biological productivity and remineralization. Direct verification of the uptake would be nearly impossible since changes in the air-sea flux due to fertilization would be much smaller than those resulting from natural spatial variability. Because of the sensitivity of the uptake to the long-term fate of the iron and organic matter, indirect verification by measurement of the organic matter flux would require high vertical resolution and long-term monitoring. Finally, the downward displacement of the nutrient profile resulting from an iron-induced productivity spurt may paradoxically lead to a long-term reduction in biological productivity. In the worst-case scenario, removing 1 ton of carbon from the atmosphere for a century is associated with a 30-ton reduction in biological export of carbon.

AB  - Methane emitted and flared from industrial sources across the United States is a major contributor to global climate change. Methanotrophic bacteria can transform this methane into useful protein-rich biomass, already approved for inclusion into animal feed. In the rapidly growing aquaculture industry, methanotrophic additives have a favourable amino acid profile and can offset ocean-caught fishmeal, reducing demands on over-harvested fisheries. Here we analyse the economic potential of producing methanotrophic microbial protein from stranded methane produced at wastewater treatment plants, landfills, and oil and gas facilities. Our results show that current technology can enable production, in the United States alone, equivalent to 14\% of the global fishmeal market at prices at or below the current cost of fishmeal (roughly US\$1,600 per metric ton). A sensitivity analysis highlights technically and economically feasible cost reductions (such as reduced cooling or labour requirements), which could allow stranded methane from the United States alone to satisfy global fishmeal demand. Methanotrophic bacteria can capture waste greenhouse gas emissions and feed fish, reducing the need for wild captures. An economic analysis shows great potential for this approach to replace aquaculture feed at competitive prices.

AB  - The global share of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships is on the rise which will become a significant portion leading to climate changes and other environmental issues unless reduction measures are taken. Therefore, the International Maritime Origination (IMO) and other regulatory bodies have set limits for emissions and defined emission controlled areas. As a result, alternative fuel such as Hydrogen and liquefied natural gas (LNG) that are low in greenhouse gas emission and competitive in cost are gradually being entered into the shipping industry. However, these alternative fuel technologies are still in the developing stage and the necessary infrastructure is not fully developed yet. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that majority of the ships continue to burn fossil fuel for the foreseeable future. A promising and viable solution for reducing the emissions is to reduce the fuel consumption through efficiency improvement. In this context, electro-technologies are shown to be capable of playing a vital role in improving fuel efficiency and thereby reducing emissions. The aim of this paper is to present a review on recent advancements of electro-technologies that help improve fuel efficiency of ships. A hybrid electric ship propulsion system is discussed as an example to show the potential of electro-technologies in improving the fuel efficiency.

AB  - The International Maritime Organization introduced two energy efficiency indexes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships. One of the short-run solutions is to reduce ship speed. The present research calculates the cost-effectiveness of reducing CO2 emissions and the improved Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) corresponded to the reduced Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) due to slow steaming. As a case study, RO-RO cargo vessel has been investigated. Reducing ship speed by 10% and 40% will reduce CO2 emission by 27.05% and 78.39% with cost-effectiveness of 121.2 $/ton CO2 and 287.6 $/ton CO2, respectively. The attained EEDI values will be improved by 2.04% and 35.81% with the reduced EEOI values by 8.76% and 70.65%, respectively. Although ship slow steaming by 40% would comply with the required EEDI for the first and the second phases, the complied EEDI value needs to be further reduced by 7% in the year 2025.

AB  - Trending in the maritime industry nowadays, is towards an energy efficient and fuel saving. Moreover, concerns regarding global warming issues caused by massive air pollution in sea area by the ship combustion engine and depletion of fossil fuels have attracted attention and opportunities for many parties. The electric propulsion has been used in ship for many years. It has triggered the concept of all electric ship where all electrical equipment including electric propulsion, connected to the electrical networks to achieve better fuel consumption with less emission. However, the main generation in the ship is still diesel generators. Connecting more generator in parallel is normal practice to cater the load. However, due to the nature of non-linear characteristic in thermal unit, such as diesel generator, based on specific fuel consumption (SFC) curve, the generator loading is not efficient when running the generator with low load factor or higher SFC. Thus, the effective energy scheduling is needed among the generators so that the generators is operated in optimum point. The case study in this paper is ferry, with a conversion from traditional diesel mechanical power to electric propulsion powered by diesel generator as a main source and energy storage as secondary source. This paper analyzes how much the operating cost of the scheduled system implemented in this practical electric ferry based on an estimation of SFC curve considering the dynamic load profile.

AB  - Hydrogen is an alternative to conventional heavy marine fuel oil following the initial strategy of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Although hydrogen energy has many advantages (zero-emission, high efficiency, and low noise), it has considerable fire and explosion risks due to its thermal and chemical characteristics (wide flammable concentration range and low ignition energy). Thus, safety is a key concern related to the use of hydrogen. Whereas most previous studies focused on the terrestrial environment, we aim to analyze the effects of the ship's motion on hydrogen dispersion (using commercial FLUENT code) in an enclosed area. When compared to the steady state, our results revealed that hydrogen reached specific sensors in 63\% and 52\% less time depending on vessel motion type and direction. Since ships carry and use a large amount of hydrogen as a power source, the risk of hydrogen leakage from collision or damage necessitates studying the correspondence between leakage, diffusion, and motion characteristics of the ship to position the sensor correctly.

IS  - 2
AB  - The decision-making process regarding the choice of alternative energy is multidimensional, made up of a number of aspects at different levels-economic, technical, environmental, and social. In this respect multicriteria analysis appears to be the most appropriate tool to understand all the different perspectives involved and to support those concerned with the decision making process by creating a set of relationships between the various alternatives. The main aim of this paper is to make a preliminary assessment regarding the feasibility of installing some wind energy turbines in a site on the island of Salina (Aeolian islands-Italy). Thus, a multicriteria method will be applied in order to support the selection and evaluation of one or more of the solutions proposed. Having analysed the local environmental conditions and its energy profile, four wind turbine configurations were postulated as options. These options were then appraised by comparison against a family of criteria and calculations were performed using a multicriteria algorithm to rank the solutions, from the best to worst. The option at the top of the ranking refers to the installation of a plant of 150kW and this emerged as the right compromise between the costs of realization, local energy requirements and the need to conserve the area and the environment especially in view of the high/medium-bracket tourism business on the island. The sensitivity analysis performed subsequently backed up the findings. As this work demonstrates, multicriteria analysis can provide a valid tool to aid decision making for achieving targets relating to more sustainable green energy. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This chapter examines why U.S. offshore wind farms do not exist and identifies sites most suitable for development based on European offshore wind farms. A survey of current literature indicates that U.S. development is stalled due to a lack of government and financial support. The literature identifies common attributes associated with the successful deployment of European offshore farms and provides a basis for a multi-criteria decision analysis of potential U.S offshore wind farm sites. A review of European wind farms indicates that a small, 10-50MW farm located in shallow waters of less than 20m might be more successful than previous U.S. development efforts. The review also identifies common European attributes deemed critical for success. These attributes are modified, taking into account unique U.S. factors, and a set of nine critical attributes are derived for use in a multi-criteria decision analysis model of suitable U.S. locations. The nine critical attributes (wind quality, water depth, shore distance, state support, public support, industrial support, population density, weather, and energy costs), along with associated utility function values, are applied to 23 past and current proposed U.S. sites. The model identified three sites, in Galveston Island, TX, Port Isabel, TX, and Block Island, RI, as being most favorable for a small wind farm.

In the study area, the Triassic Bunter Sandstone reservoir shows consistent thicknesses (90-216 m) and prospective core-based porosities and permeabilities (11-28%, 9-669 mD). A connected reservoir is suggested regionally from consistent, near-hydrostatic aquifer pressure gradients (~0.51 psi/ft) and leakage is mitigated through a thick, laterally-effective top seal. Structural closures in the area are generally less than the CO2 column heights necessary to breach the seal. At least eleven mapped closures are shown to link together into the proposed regional fill-and-spill â€œSilverpit CCS Fairwayâ€. If filled to spill, these traps could cumulatively host up to 7.9 Gt of CO2, three times that of the proposed Endurance CCS Field. Through management of the injection and fill-spill strategy, this fairway could be future-proofed in relation to CO2 spill hazards, whilst possibly requiring less 'injector hubs' to fill the traps. Migration spill-point modelling along the fairway may also inform the placement of permanent, cost-effective multi-physics seabed system for leakage and migration monitoring. Exploiting fill-and-spill fairways for CCS is a new concept with vast potential applicability globally. Â© (2021) by the European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers (EAGE)All rights reserved.

AB  - New generations of ship must meet new challenges, particularly in terms of energy efficiency, reliability and environmental impacts. One of the future goals of shipbuilding is to reduce the impact of ship emissions to respond to existent and future regulations of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) on greenhouse gas and pollutants emissions. In this context, Hybrid Propulsion Systems (HPS) are promising solutions to meet these requirements. This work presents a state of the art of hybrid propulsion systems for small vessels. The paper includes a general description of the future challenges for shipbuilding and a description of the possible topologies of HPS which can be implemented in small ships. The key features of the HPS components are also described and several electric and hybrid propulsion small ship are presented

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20

AB  - The fluctuation of the oil price and the growing requirement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have forced ship builders and shipping companies to improve the energy efficiency of the vessels. The accurate prediction of the required propulsion power at various operating condition is essential to evaluate the energy-saving potential of a vessel. Currently, a new ship is expected to use the ISO15016 method in estimating added resistance induced by external environmental factors in power prediction. However, since ISO15016 usually assumes static water conditions, it may result in low accuracy when it is applied to various operating conditions. Moreover, it is time consuming to apply the ISO15016 method because it is computationally expensive and requires many input data. To overcome this limitation, we propose a data-driven approach to predict the propulsion power of a vessel. In this study, support vector regression (SVR) is used to learn from big data obtained from onboard measurement and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) database. As a result, we show that our data-driven approach shows superior performance compared to the ISO15016 method if the big data of the solid line are secured. Â© 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Blue Carbon Ecosystems and Their Role in Climate Change Mitigation-An Overview
JO  - Journal Of Climate Change
PY  - 2016
VL  - 2
IS  - 2
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems include mangroves and other tidal wetlands such as seagrasses and salt marshes. Coastal blue carbon is thought to provide climate change mitigation benefits in view of their ability to store carbon under adverse conditions and this in the recent times has garnered the attention of the scientific community at large. Mangroves are one of the most productive ecosystems and their carbon storage potential is much greater as compared to sea grasses and salt marshes. Mangroves sequester carbon in their living biomass as well as the sediments. The tropical Asian mangroves show the greatest mangrove diversity and the highest biomass accumulation. But, the carbon storage potential of their living biomass is outcompeted by their sedimentary carbon storage. Mangrove sediments play a special and quantitatively important role in carbon storage than previously thought. They store both autochthonous and allochthonous organic matter due to their strategic location at the interface between land and sea and prevailing reducing conditions. Indian mangrove ecosystems which also comprises one of the largest mangrove forest of the world may offer a possible opportunity for the development of blue carbon market economy. But there exist a large number of gaps in the available blue carbon literature. The available studies largely focus on the living biomass storage and sedimentary storage is un-surveyed. Mangrove research in India have shown significant growth in the past few decades but the targeted approach towards delineating the ecosystems' carbon stocks and the factors controlling them are still lacking. The need of the hour is to correctly map and document the mangroves in India for their carbon storage in order to build a better and reliable picture of the role of these ecosystems in climate change mitigation.

AB  - Marine and hydrokinetic (MHK) energy from free-flowing waves, tides and currents comprises an important source of clean and renewable energy. The development of technologies for harnessing MHK energy and assessing its environmental effects is still at early stage. In this work, we develop a computational model for simulating hydrokinetic turbines with bed-load sediment transport under clear-water scour conditions. Turbulent flow is simulated using large-eddy simulation (LES). The bed surface elevation is simulated by solving the non-equilibrium continuity equation, the so-called Exner-Polya equation. The turbine blades are parameterized as actuator lines. The developed model is applied to simulate the flow past an axial-flow hydrokinetic turbine mounted on an erodible bed in an open channel. A good agreement with measurements is obtained. The effects of turbine operating conditions and sediment particle sizes on the bed-load sediment transport are then examined. Finally the turbine wake characteristics are investigated for a rigid flat bed and the eroded bed under different turbine operating conditions. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd

JO  - Aob Plants
PY  - 2015
VL  - 7
IS  - SI
AB  - Climate change will bring about rising sea levels and increasing drought, both of which will contribute to increasing salinization in many regions of the world. There will be consequent effects on our crops, which cannot withstand significant salinization. This Special Issue looks at the roles that can be played by halophytes, extremophiles that do tolerate salinities toxic to most plants. In an ecological context, papers deal with the conservation of a rare species, the effects of rising concentrations of CO2 and flooding on coastal vegetation, and the consequences of tree planting in inland plains for salinization. Physiological studies deal with the different effects of chlorides and sulfates on the growth of halophytes, the ability of some parasitic plants to develop succulence when growing on halophytic hosts and the interesting finding that halophytes growing in their natural habitat do not show signs of oxidative stress. Nevertheless, spraying with ascorbic acid can enhance ascorbic acid-dependent antioxidant enzymes and growth in a species of Limonium. Enzymes preventing oxidative stress are expressed constitutively as is the case with the vacuolar H-ATPase, a key enzyme in ion compartmentation. A comparison of salt-excreting and non-excreting grasses showed the former to have higher shoot to root Na+ ratios than the latter. A particularly tolerant turf grass is described, as is the significance of its ability to secrete ions. A study of 38 species showed the importance of the interaction of a low osmotic potential and cell wall properties in maintaining growth. From an applied point of view, the importance of identifying genotypes and selecting those best suited for the product required, optimizing the conditions necessary for germination and maximizing yield are described. The consequence of selection for agronomic traits on salt tolerance is evaluated, as is the use of halophytes as green manures. Halophytes are remarkable plants: they are rare in relation to the total number of flowering plants and they tolerate salinities that most species cannot. It is clear from the papers published in this Special Issue that research into halophytes has a distinct place in aiding our understanding of salt tolerance in plants, an understanding that is likely to be of importance as climate change and population growth combine to challenge our ability to feed the human population of the world.

AB  - The objective of this study is to review the state of art and the opportunity on LNG development as marine fuel for Indonesian shipping sector. Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) as one of source energy has become one progressing on research and development by several research company, classification society and shipping company. The research that has been done focused on the environmental benefit to the country. This was as a result of increasing quantity of pollutions due to marine fuel used by vessels. The interesting part from the study that LNG will reduce sulphur (SOx) until 90-95 % and reduce the carbon until 25 % which it causes for other alternative energy will develop and progress slowly. The use of natural gas as alternative energy is one of the goals to find the potential solution for ship owner to follow the IMO requirement for the stakeholder to implement the limitation on sulphur content from marine vessel exhaust gas. Annex VI mandated the ship operator to use marine fuel which contain 0.5 % sulphur or install the scrubber which it will expensively cost for the ship owner. LNG from some of literatures shown the most advance compare to other alternative fuel and it will provide benefit from environmental protection and cost efficiency.

VL  - 50
IS  - 8
AB  - Oscillation issues of the gird-connected offshore wind farm through the voltage-source converter-based high-voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) have serios influence on the grid stability. However, in the previous modeling and analysis for the VSC-HVDC system, the receiving-end inverter station is usually considered as a constant voltage source, neglecting the impact of the inverter and AC grid. In addition, the commonly used mitigation method by modifying control parameters usually does not consider its influence on the controller's control performance. To analyze the system stability more rigorously and suppress the oscillation effectively, in this work, we firstly establish a detailed impedance model of VSC-HVDC considering the inverter station and DC transmission line, based on which the stability analysis is also presented. Furthermore, an oscillation suppression method based on intelligent impedance optimization is proposed, which is solved by Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The proposed impedance optimization method can achieve the maximum stability margin while the transient dynamic performance is still guaranteed, thereby suppressing the oscillation of the system. Simulations are conducted in PSCAD/EMTDC to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed modeling and suppression method. Â© 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Ocean carbon inventory under warmer climate conditions the case of the Last Interglacial
JO  - Climate Of The Past
PY  - 2018
VL  - 14
IS  - 12
AB  - During the Last Interglacial period (LIG), the transition from 125 to 115 ka provides a case study for assessing the response of the carbon system to different levels of high-latitude warmth. Elucidating the mechanisms responsible for interglacial changes in the ocean carbon inventory provides constraints on natural carbon sources and sinks and their climate sensitivity, which are essential for assessing potential future changes. However, the mechanisms leading to modifications of the ocean's carbon budget during this period remain poorly documented and not well understood. Using a state-of-the-art Earth system model, we analyze the changes in oceanic carbon dynamics by comparing two quasi-equilibrium states: the early, warm Eemian (125 ka) versus the cooler, late Eemian (115 ka). We find considerably reduced ocean dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC; - 314 : 1 PgC) storage in the warm climate state at 125 ka as compared to 115 ka, mainly attributed to changes in the biological pump and ocean DIC disequilibrium components. The biological pump is mainly driven by changes in interior ocean ventilation timescales, but the processes controlling the changes in ocean DIC disequilibrium remain difficult to assess and seem more regionally affected. While the Atlantic bottom-water disequilibrium is affected by the organization of sea-ice-induced southern-sourced water (SSW) and northern-sourced water (NSW), the upper-layer changes remain unexplained. Due to its large size, the Pacific accounts for the largest DIC loss, approximately 57\% of the global decrease. This is largely associated with better ventilation of the interior Pacific water mass. However, the largest simulated DIC differences per unit volume are found in the SSWs of the Atlantic. Our study shows that the deep-water geometry and ventilation in the South Atlantic are altered between the two climate states where warmer climatic conditions cause SSWs to retreat southward and NSWs to extent further south. This process is mainly responsible for the simulated DIC reduction by restricting the extent of DIC-rich SSW, thereby reducing the storage of biological remineralized carbon at depth.

JO  - Journal Of Industrial Ecology
PY  - 2022
VL  - 26
IS  - 6
AB  - Maritime shipping is under increasing pressure to alleviate its environmental impact. To this end, life-cycle footprint accounting provides a foundation for taking targeted measures in the green transition of shipping. This study used the process-based hybrid life-cycle inventory (LCI) modeling approach to estimate the â€œcradle-to-propellerâ€ footprint of ships, including primary energy consumption, carbon dioxide emissions, and sulfur dioxide emissions. We used the inputâ€“output LCI model to calculate the embodied energy and emissions associated with the material and fuel use of ship manufacturing. We used a bottom-up emission model and global marine traffic data to estimate the operational footprint of different types of ships. Based on 382 cargo ships (including bulk carriers, container ships, and general cargo ships) constructed in mainland China between 2011 and 2015, we estimated that the embodied footprint accounted forÂ <10% of the cradle-to-propeller footprint under the pre-2019 policy scenario. In terms of life-cycle energy intensity (MJ/nm/1000 deadweight tonnage [DWT]), the large bulk carrier (>100,000 DWT) establishes the lowest value (46), followed by the small (0â€“100,000 DWT) bulk carrier (96), the large container ship (133), the small container ship (196), and the small general cargo (238). The bulk carrier was identified as the most energy efficient among the three ship types, and ships with larger capacities (i.e., DWT) had higher energy efficiencies than ships with lower capacities. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the life-cycle footprints of cargo ships, thus enabling better evidence-based policymaking to transition the global marine-shipping industry to a future of greener energy.

JO  - Restoration Ecology
PY  - 2021
VL  - 29
IS  - 5
AB  - Reducing soil nutrient availability has been proposed as a strategy to favor native vs. non-native invasive plant species and represents a potential alternative to traditional manual removal or chemical control methods. We implemented a field experiment in invaded dry and wet montane Hawaiian ecosystems to test responses of soil and dominant plant species to three soil nutrient treatments (ControlÂ =Â no nutrient manipulation; CarbonÂ =Â C substrate added to reduce nutrients; FertilizerÂ =Â fertilizer added to increase nutrients) and two non-native plant treatments (Weeds removed; Weeds present) in a fully factorial experiment in each ecosystem over 18 months. Carbon amendments reduced soil inorganic nutrient availability by 60â€“70% in dry shrubland and 30â€“50% in wet forest. Fertilizer amendments increased soil inorganic nutrient availability by >20-fold. Altered nutrient availability did not impact gross mineralization or nitrification rates in either ecosystem. In dry shrubland, neither C amendments nor weed removal altered growth or reproduction, but fertilizer increased woody growth and forb/grass reproduction in both natives and non-natives. In wet forest, weed removal but not C amendments increased growth and survival of native woody seedlings, while fertilizer decreased native seedling survival and increased non-native woody seedling growth. Overall, growth and reproduction of native and non-natives responded similarly to altered nutrient availability, indicating that for the tropical ecosystems and species examined, manipulating nutrient availability does not favor native versus non-native invasive plants in the first 18 months. In contrast, weed removal had positive effects on native plant growth, likely mediated through changes in other resources. Â© 2021 Society for Ecological Restoration.

VL  - NA

AB  - In April 2018 at the 72nd session of IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee, a GHG strategy consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goals was adopted. The main target set was to reduce absolute GHG emissions from shipping in 2050 by 50% compared to 2008. To reduce GHG emissions there are five main technical and operational measures: hull design; power and propulsion; alternative fuels; alternative energy sources; and operations. In this paper we focus on the potential reductions through hull design, i.e. length and hull shapes in relation to speed and sea states. Our findings indicate that moderate increases of length and reduction of block to enable better hull shapes give 10 - 20 % reduction of annual fuel consumption and hence emissions for a low or even negative abatement cost. Achieving these reductions will require that national and international authorities stop penalizing energy efficient ships with increased length compared to standard tonnage through higher port and fairway fees; pilotage rules; and artificial sailing restrictions.

AB  - Over the past decade regulatory emission control has been adopted and even stricter emission reductions are being considered. In order to comply with the present and future regulations the ship owners and engine manufacturers are facing a difficult task. The shipping industry is presently offering multiple choices such as scrubbers and Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), dual fuel engines, Liquefied Natural Gas/Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LNG/LPG) powered engines, and lately the introduction of methanol and ethanol as alternative fuels. This work presents a short overview of the possible use of methanol and ethanol as alternative fuels in shipping. The first part of this work deals with physical properties of methanol and ethanol, production and availability, as well as advantages and disadvantages in comparison with other fuels. In the second part the cost perspective is presented together with the cost-benefit analysis, which is the most important aspect in the ship ownerâ€™s decision whether to invest into the new alternative. Methanol and ethanol are not magical solutions, but rather another alternative which, from the cost perspective, offers a potential under certain circumstances. These circumstances are competitive prices in comparison to Marine Gas Oil (MGO) and time spent in Emission Control Area (ECA) which should be a large portion of the total sailing time. In this paper the scientific methodology was followed by using the method of compilation, the descriptive and the comparative methods. Â© 2019, Faculty of Transport and Traffic Engineering.

AB  - Coastal wetland ecosystems have a great capacity to store carbon (C), and the condition has a significant influence on carbon emissions and segregation. This study aims to estimate carbon stocks in both vegetation and soil of coastal wetland ecosystems, and to compare the C stocks of different ecosystems and soil layers. This study classified coastal wetland ecosystems into six types, and C stocks were quantified through the measurement of vegetation biomass and soil C. The C stocks of estuaries, muddy beaches, coastal saltwater lakes, mangroves, deltas, and seagrass beds were 210.73, 243.00, 167.41, 426.57, 185.88, and 297.85 MgC ha(-1), respectively. Mangroves were found to be the most carbon-rich ecosystem. The total organic C content (TOC) of soil decreased with soil depth and was the highest in the top 0-20 cm layer. The total C storage of coastal wetland ecosystems in Hainan Island was 56.51x10(5) Mg of C. These estimates show that there is an urgent requirement to protect coastal wetland ecosystems.

TI  - How to Incorporate Blue Carbon into the China Certified Emission Reductions Scheme: Legal and Policy Perspectives
JO  - Sustainability
PY  - 2022
VL  - 14
IS  - 17
AB  - Blue carbon, the carbon sequestered in vegetated coastal ecosystems, is a potential and practical approach to combating climate change. Many countries have committed to integrating blue carbon into the climate change law and policy framework. As a significant carbon-emitting country, China has abundant blue carbon resources but suffers a significant loss of coastal habitats. Therefore, blue carbon should become a primary focus in China's climate change law and policy. Given the successful experience in terrestrial biosequestration projects, the inclusion of blue carbon into China's carbon trading market can be an essential move and is the primary purpose of this paper. The China Certified Emission Reductions (CCER) scheme is an effective supplementary mechanism to the national carbon trading market. To incorporate blue carbon into the CCER scheme, this article first analyzes the legislative framework underpinning the CCER scheme and indicates some critical factors, including methodology, project boundaries, legal rights, additionality, project period, and crediting period. Subsequently, the article discusses these critical factors in depth to identify legal issues that may emerge and provides several feasible solutions. (i) Dedicated methodologies need to be developed for blue carbon projects, which include a broader definition for carbon abatement activities. (ii) The new national marine functional zoning should delineate zones for the purpose of developing blue carbon projects. (iii) The current authorization system for the right to use sea areas could be used to secure a legal right to develop blue carbon projects. (iv) Additionality requirements should be appropriately adjusted. (v) Extended project periods and crediting periods would be needed. This article offers novel pathways for including blue carbon in China's climate change law and policy framework, thus contributing to achieving its 2060 carbon neutrality goal.

The total carbon stock in R. stylosa forest was 264.50 ton ha-1, while the annual net carbon budget, carbon gain and carbon input in R. stylosa forest was 23.54, 24.85 and 5.64 ton ha-1. However, the total CO2 stored in R. stylosa forest was 969.83 ton ha-1, while the annual of net CO2 uptake, CO2 gained and CO2 input was 86.33, 91.12 and 20.86 ton ha-1. The higher carbon sequestration and CO2 uptake in R. stylosa forest indicate its significant role in the global carbon accumulation and reducing atmospheric CO2.

AB  - In order to extract energy from sea waves it is necessary that the motion of Wave Energy Converters (WECs) is properly controlled. This is even more crucial for devices like buoys, whose dimensions are small compared to the wavelength of incident waves. In this paper a control approach which is adapted on a wave-to-wave basis and that employs also a reactive component in addition to the damping one is proposed. This reactive component while improving average power extraction can result in excessive over rating of the Power Take-Off (PTO). On the other hand, the PTO size gives specific limitations on the actual power and torque that the system can handle. The proposed control strategy is developed to optimize the average power extraction by effectively including such electro-mechanical constraints at the algorithm design stage. Simulation tests performed in irregular waves and considering different sea states have shown that such integrated technique leads to a significant improvement of the overall power performance, compared to other, more established, control solutions.

AB  - Converter valves are the core equipment of offshore wind power structures. However, they are highly vulnerable to vibration under strong earthquakes, which will affect normal operation of the offshore wind farm. Converter station is an axisymmetric structure with obvious asymmetry in its internal configuration of the superstructure. This study aimed to analyze the dynamic response of a supported converter valve in an offshore converter station under seismic excitation. The coupling model of the supported valve tower group and the converter station were established, and the distribution law of the valve tower dynamic response and foundation settlement were investigated. The dynamic response effect of the modal truncation, valve tower stiffness, and basic size on different areas and foundations of the valve towers were studied. The findings were as follows: (i) the effect of local vibration of the valve tower should not be simplified by using equivalent mass and node condensation; (ii) the structure-equipment coupling analysis method should be used to review the structural design scheme of the offshore converter station in the intensity VII region; (iii) the vertical higher-order modes should be considered during the vibration response calculation and its participation ratio in mass should not be lower than 90\%; (iv) the frequency range that minimizes the vibration response is the characteristic frequency range of horizontal vibration, while the best vibration suppression effect cannot be obtained in both the horizontal and vertical directions; and (v) the stiffness of the valve tower itself should be adjusted and different stiffness designs of the valve tower in different positions should be adopted to realize effective vibration response control.

VL  - 29
IS  - 9
AB  - Despite recent technical advances, there is a risk that commercial-scale fusion will not play a substantial role in mitigating climate change or alleviating energy poverty due to a lack of public or community support, often referred to as a lack of a social license. This risk is not academic - other technologies, such as fission reactors, spent fuel waste repositories (e.g., Yucca Mountain), genetically modified foods, onshore and offshore wind turbines, electrical transmission lines, and even vaccines, struggle due to rejection by a substantial fraction of society, in other words, a lack of social acceptance. Conventional approaches to this challenge, such as risk-reducing technical solutions (e.g., replacing fission with fusion), or better "communication"or "education,"are unlikely, on their own, to be sufficient to mitigate this risk. Fortunately, fusion is sufficiently young that it has an opportunity to distinguish itself from other energy technologies not just in the way that it uses physics, but also in the way that it approaches society. In particular, fusion can anticipate, rather than react to, public concerns. Looking to other industries and fields of research, this paper describes the risk of a lack of public support and methods to achieve such support, including a social license, bio-ethical review, and responsible research and innovation. These methods are discussed in the context of seven case studies, illustrating practical application. The paper concludes with recommendations for specific steps that fusion companies, non-governmental organizations, academic researchers, government funders, and government regulators can take now to facilitate a long-term social license for fusion energy.

JO  - Journal Of Experimental Biology
PY  - 2011
VL  - 214
IS  - 15
AB  - Anthropogenic CO2 is reducing the pH and altering the carbonate chemistry of seawater, with repercussions for marine organisms and ecosystems. Current research suggests that calcification will decrease in many species, but compelling evidence of impaired functional performance of calcium carbonate structures is sparse, particularly in key species. Here we demonstrate that ocean acidification markedly degrades the mechanical integrity of larval shells in the mussel Mytilus californianus, a critical community member on rocky shores throughout the northeastern Pacific. Larvae cultured in seawater containing CO2 concentrations expected by the year 2100 (540 or 970ppm) precipitated weaker, thinner and smaller shells than individuals raised under present-day seawater conditions (380ppm), and also exhibited lower tissue mass. Under a scenario where mussel larvae exposed to different CO2 levels develop at similar rates, these trends suggest a suite of potential consequences, including an exacerbated vulnerability of new settlers to crushing and drilling attacks by predators; poorer larval condition, causing increased energetic stress during metamorphosis; and greater risks from desiccation at low tide due to shifts in shell area to body mass ratios. Under an alternative scenario where responses derive exclusively from slowed development, with impacted individuals reaching identical milestones in shell strength and size by settlement, a lengthened larval phase could increase exposure to high planktonic mortality rates. In either case, because early life stages operate as population bottlenecks, driving general patterns of distribution and abundance, the ecological success of this vital species may be tied to how ocean acidification proceeds in coming decades.

AB  - The German market for composite materials is the biggest in Europe by volume, representing almost one third of the market. With 27% of the volume, it is far ahead of Italy (17%), France (16%) and other European countries. The German market is strongly influenced by the automobile sector, and the use of natural fibers in composites has increased despite the relatively poor economic situation in the automotive industry. On an average 3.5kg of natural fibers are used per passenger car in Germany, and together with other composite applications it adds up to about five to ten kg of natural fibers per passenger cars. Aeronautics is another field, which is pulling the composites market in the country. Meanwhile, onshore development in Germany in the corresponding years is expected to be 8% to 9% higher, and fast development is expected in the offshore wind power sector. Germany still remains the largest wind energy market in the world, and its future depends on the development of new onshore areas, replacement of old wind turbines by modern and larger turbines, and offshore wind energy use.

AB  - The maritime industry has developed immensely in the 21st century. One term that has a great importance and basis in the various aspects of shipping and maritime operations is fuel propulsion. Fuel propulsion is the fundamental rock that any machinery and shipping procedure is set upon nowadays. Despite the improvement in the maritime industry, there is still a major issue to tackle, which is the effect of using non-efficient energy sources (propulsion methods) (non-friendly). Per example, fuel oil is the main energy source for propulsion onboard most of the ships producing harmful emissions such as CO2, SOx and NOx, GHG. This has a direct negative impact on the marine and air environment in different ways. As a result, the IMO exerted great efforts in enhancing the energy efficiency aspect in order to save as much energy as possible from the shipping industry. These efforts appear vividly in the conventions and regulations adopted by the IMO and its amendments in different shapes, such as: The Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI). The Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP). All the ships must have an â€œenergy efficiency management planâ€ that includes steps to insure the optimum energy saving during their voyage, these steps include; regular maintenance and checkups as well as energy efficient habits to be strictly followed by the crewmembers onboard. This paper will formulate the energy efficiency policies and will discuss how to implement these policies and the measures that can be taken to comply with it. Also, the paper will focus more on the technical solutions such as using alternative energy source and introducing new energy efficiency modifications for the ships with the main aim to save energy, reduce the harmful air emission and their effect on the environment.

JO  - Journal Of Cleaner Production
PY  - 2022
VL  - 367
IS  - NA
AB  - Methane-arrested anaerobic digestion (MAAD) provides a sustainable route for cleaner production of carboxylic acids from renewable biomass. However, low acid productivity and high product recovery costs have restricted widespread industrial implementation of this technology. This study enhances carboxylic acid (C-2 to C-8) pro-duction from cellulosic biomass using a newly developed integrated digestion-separation system. Using a mixed culture of marine microorganisms grown under mesophilic conditions (40 ?), paper and chicken manure were co-digested to produce carboxylic acids through semi-continuous four-stage countercurrent MAAD. During digestion, multi-stage CO2-sustained anion-exchange resin (Amberlite IRA-67) adsorption was applied for in-situ recovery of inhibitory acid products from the digestion medium. Efficiency was enhanced by supplying 1-atm CO2 during the in-situ adsorption process. Compared with stand-alone digestion (control), biomass conversion and acid yield in the integrated MAAD system significantly increased by 2.28 and 2.09 times, respectively. The integrated system also increased the mass fractions of longer-chain carboxylic acids (C5 and C6) in liquid products. With various amounts of resin, the optimal normalized resin loadings for biomass conversion and acid yield were 10.9 and 14.6 g wet resin/(Lliq.d), respectively. This work demonstrates countercurrent digestion coupled with in-situ product separation via CO2-sustained anion-exchange resin is highly effective at recovering carboxylic acids from cellulosic biomass.

JO  - Philosophical Transactions Of The Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical And Engineering Sciences
PY  - 2019
VL  - 377
IS  - 2138
AB  - To save energy and reduce environmental impacts, new technologies towards a development of a sustainable 'greener' economy are needed. The main opportunity to improve sustainability by reducing emissions is within the transport sector. More than 90% of all goods worldwide are transported by ships. Particularly maritime ships using heavy fuel oil and marine gas oil play a major role. The total fuel consumption of shipping in 2016 was about 250 m t (domestic ca. 50 m t, international shipping ca. 200 m t). The vast portion of the energy consumption of a ship is the need to overcome the drag between ship hull and water-depending on the shape of the vessel and its size up to 90% of total fuel consumption. This means reducing drag helps to save fuel and reduces carbon emissions as well as pollution considerably. Different techniques for drag reduction are known, e.g. the micro-bubble technique or the bulbous bow. We investigated a novel bioinspired technique since 2002: the application of biomimetic surfaces with long-term stable air layers on ship hulls, serving as a slip agent. This technology is based on the Salvinia Effect, allowing a permanent stabilization of air layers under water. In this case study, we analysed the possible savings, which also could be combined with modified micro-bubble technologies. We calculated, based on a selection of five ship types, representing 75% of the world fleet, that air-layer hull coatings could lead to estimated savings of 32.5 million tons of fuel (meaning 13.0% of the worldwide shipping fuel consumption), equal to 18.5 billion US$ and 130.0 million tons of CO 2e per year. The positive impacts on global temperature and other greenhouse gases are calculated and could be a contributing factor in accomplishing the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The study is a contribution to enhance our patchy knowledge concerning the potential economic and ecological benefit of bionics and biomimetic technologies.

AB  - The various plant parts of a mangrove, Avicennia marina and a salt marsh, Salicornia brachiata, namely leaves, stems, and roots from Tamil Nadu, India, were analyzed for variation in their carbon sequestration potential for a period during July 2019 to August 2020. The investigations were done using a carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur analyzer. The carbon (C) concentration for different seasons revealed a maximum value of 447.26 g C kg-1 (44.726\%) in leaves of A. marina recorded during premonsoon months at Nagapattinam, and the minimum of 269.57 g C kg-1 (26.957\%) in the roots during monsoon season at Thoothukudi. Similarly, the maximum value of 514.08 g C kg-1 (51.408\%) was recorded in leaves of S. brachiata during post-monsoon at Nagapattinam and the minimum of 183.26 g C kg-1 (18.326\%) during monsoon in roots at Thoothukudi. The physicochemical parameters such as bulk density, pH, sediment organic matter, and microbial loads of A. marina and S. brachiata reported considerable variation. The mean value of soil organic carbon in A. marina was 24.92 g C kg-1 and 8.04 g C kg-1 in S. brachiata. There was a significant difference in sediment organic matter between the stations (p . 0.01). Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy was carried out to identify the functional groups such as amides amines, carbonyl-containing compounds, and alcohols in the sediments of both the species; it was observed that a major broadband around 3621 cm-1 assigned to be due to hydrogen-bonded O-H stretching vibration and another band around 1052 cm-1 due to C-N stretch. Regardless of their significance, information on the current spatial dispersion (event and degree) of mangroves and salt marshes is fragmented.

AB  - Carbon dioxide emission through soil respiration is an important component Of the carbon balance in forest ecosystems. However, little information is available on the rates of soil respiration in mangrove forests. We Studied the rate of soil respiration in it secondary mangrove forest in eastern Thailand on air estuary of the Trat River during both the wet and dry seasons. A study site of 40 x 110 m was established and a series of vegetation zones identified: Sonneratia, Avicennia, Rhizophora and Xylocarpus, in order of increasing elevation inland. Soil respiration was measured during low tide, using an infrared gas analyser connected to it respiratory chamber, by excluding the respiration of above-ground roots from the chamber. At least 19 measurements were performed in each zone for each season. The rate of soil respiration significantly increased with increasing soil temperature. The soil temperature which was usually lower than that of sea water showed a trend that decreased with distance from the river in both wet and dry seasons. The relative land elevation causes different periods of inundation among the vegetation zones. The period was longest in the Sonneratia zone located on the river fringe, and became shorter moving inland. Thus, the elevation and relevant period of inundation are considered to be causal factors warming the soil. Consequently, the difference in soil temperature Caused significantly different rates of soil respiration among the vegetation zones in the mangrove forest. Overall, the average rate of soil respiration ranged from 0.456 to 0.8 76 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), supporting the view that mangrove forests have lower rates of soil respiration than do upland forests.

AB  - There is overwhelming evidence that unrestrained anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases have the potential to cause climate change with disastrous consequences. In recent years, global atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) have reached 385 parts per million (ppm), compared to preindustrial levels of around 280 ppm. Half of this increase has occurred in the last thirty years. Achievement of current government targets and pledges to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would lead the world toward a 3.5Â°C increase in global average temperature above preindustrial levels by the end of the century. If these targets and pledges are not met, it is possible that the global average temperature will increase by up to 7Â°C above preindustrial levels during that same time period. Although global warming is the most commonly referenced result of increased atmospheric concentrations of GHGs, ocean acidification is often referred to as the other half of the CO2problem. As the Earthâ€™s largest carbon sink, the oceans absorb a large proportion of atmospheric CO2, which in turn produces carbonic acid. This increases the acidity of the oceans, producing potentially devastating effects for the oceans, marine life, and its human uses, including food security. Worse yet, threats to the oceans â€“ such as global warming, ocean acidification, and deoxygenation â€“ occur in feedback loops that reinforce each other. Â© Cambridge University Press 2013.

AB  - The fixation of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) by marine phytoplankton provides an important feedback mechanism on concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere. As a consequence it is important to determine whether oceanic primary productivity is susceptible to changing atmospheric CO2 levels. Among numerous other factors, the acquisition of DIC by microalgae particularly in the polar seas is projected to have a significant effect on future phytoplanktonic production and hence atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Using the isotopic disequilibrium technique the contribution of different carbon species (CO2 and bicarbonate) to the overall DIC uptake and the extent to which external Carbonic Anhydrase (eCA) plays a role in facilitating DIC uptake was estimated. Simultaneous uptake of CO2 and HCO3- was observed in all cases, but the proportions in which different DIC species contributed to carbon assimilation varied considerably between stations. Bicarbonate as well as CO2 could be the major DIC source for local phytoplankton assemblages. There was a positive correlation between the contribution of CO2 to total DIC uptake and ambient concentration of CO2 in seawater suggesting that Southern Ocean microalgae could increase the proportion of CO2 uptake under future high atmospheric CO2 levels. Results will be discussed in view of metabolic costs related to DIC acquisition of Southern Ocean phytoplankton. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 10
IS  - 12
AB  - To reduce pollution from ships in coastal and international navigation, shipping companies are turning to various technological solutions, mostly based on electrification and the use of alternative fuels with a lower carbon footprint. One of the alternatives to traditional diesel fuel is the use of hydrogen as a fuel or hydrogen fuel cells as a power source. Their application on ships is still in the experimental phase and is limited to smaller ships, which serve as a kind of platform for evaluating the applicability of different technological solutions. However, the use of hydrogen on a large scale as a primary energy source on coastal and ocean-going vessels also requires an infrastructure for the production and safe storage of hydrogen. This paper provides an overview of color-based hydrogen classification as one of the main methods for describing hydrogen types based on currently available production technologies, as well as the principles and safety aspects of hydrogen storage. The advantages and disadvantages of the production technologies with respect to their application in the maritime sector are discussed. Problems and obstacles that must be overcome for the successful use of hydrogen as a fuel on ships are also identified. The issues presented can be used to determine long-term indicators of the global warming potential of using hydrogen as a fuel in the shipping industry and to select an appropriate cost-effective and environmentally sustainable production and storage method in light of the technological capabilities and resources of a particular area.

AB  - CO2 mineralization sequestrates CO2 in a form of mineral carbonate through chemical reactions of CO2 with metal oxide or alkaline solution. This process is attractive because it has no risk for a leakage of hazardous materials and requires a relatively small area for sequestrating CO2 compared to geological storage. In addition, generated mineral carbonate can be used as useful chemicals if its purity is high enough. One of the recent ideas in CO2 mineralization is integrating it with desalination Mineral ions needed for the CO2 mineralization are separated from seawater, and generated deionized seawater is used as a feed to a desalination process, such as reverse osmosis (RO), to reduce its electric energy load. The goal of this study is to design the proposed process and examine its sustainability. The overall process is designed and simulated using Aspen plus (R) and Matlab. Based on the simulation results, techno-economic analysis (TEA) and CO2 lifecycle assessment (CO2 LCA) are conducted to verify the sustainability. In order to identify the improvement potential of the process, a best scenario study is performed. It turns out that this process can achieve about 230tonne CO2 reduction/yr as well as relative economic benefit of almost lmillion \$/yr compared to a benchmark process which comprises the standalone Solvay process and RO. From the best scenario result, it can be concluded that the proposed process has the potential for further investigation as means to reduce the CO2 emission while generating economic benefits.

AB  - We conducted a total fuel life-cycle inventory for atmospheric emissions for two ships operating between Mainland China and Taiwan, comparing the difference that may result from operating on heavy fuel oil (HFO) and on liquefied natural gas (LNG) as fuels. In addition, we assess the global warming impact from these two fueling alternatives. We use a commercially available life-cycle assessment (LCA) software to conduct a life-cycle inventory of airborne emissions from the ship fuel use. Our findings indicate possible improvement in total fuel-life-cycle GHG emissions from the use of LNG as alternative fuel to power ships. While total GHG and CO2 emission reduced, however, methane emissions increased significantly when LNG is used as alternative fuel to power both of our case ships. Both ships exhibit great reduction in the emissions of NOx (38â€“39%) and CO (42â€“43%). The reduction is much more remarkable in SO2 (99.8%) and PM10 (97.5%). The weight of emissions from operation stage has become relatively smaller in the whole fuel life-cycle total GHG emissions, when the two ships move to operate on LNG. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Conventionally, ships have used diesel engine run generators to meet the electrical load demands varying from general lighting purposes to powering advanced machinery onboard. However, due to escalating fuel prices, the marine industry is compelled to search for alternate sources of energy to fulfill its increasing load demands. Simply relying on diesel generators for the same implies significantly increasing the ships' CO2 emissions. Therefore, it is imperative to shift from conventional to renewable sources of energy to minimize fuel consumption and thereby reduce the carbon footprint of the marine industry. This paper explores the impact of using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with Time varying inertia weight (TVIW), and Triangular PSO on the optimal sizing of PV, Energy storage system and Diesel generator output, onboard an oil tanker so as to minimize emissions at an economical cost.

AB  - Increasing activity and vessel traffic for operation and maintenance of offshore windfarms has generated considerable interest in quantifying wave climates. Winds generate ocean waves, at the same time airflow is modified by the loss of energy and momentum to the waves. Momentum the atmosphere loses to the ocean depends on the state of waves. Although the sea surface has a chaotic character, it can conveniently be described by the wave spectrum. The measurement of waves, has been one difficult problem in observing the wave climate offshore. A crucial element in the development of any numerical model is its validation .

TI  - Direct Virtual Power Control of VSC-HVDC for Starting Up of Offshore Wind Farm
JO  - NANA
PY  - 2013
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - This paper proposes a direct virtual power control algorithm based on the direct power control with space vector modulation (DPC-SVM) for offshore wind farm connected VSC converter. This control algorithm extends the scope of the traditional DPC. By introducing the virtual power, the DPC can work before the wind farm starts up when the AC side of VSC is open and the voltage stability is achieved as well. The calculation of the algorithm is simple by using most of the original DPC-SVM modules. It maintains the controller structure unchanged before and after the wind farm starts up. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm is verified through simulation in PSCAD/EMTDC software.

TI  - Trace gas fluxes from tidal salt marsh soils: implications for carbon-sulfur biogeochemistry
JO  - Biogeosciences
PY  - 2022
VL  - 19
IS  - 19
AB  - Tidal salt marsh soils can be a dynamic source of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as sulfur-based trace gases such as carbon disulfide (CS2) and dimethylsulfide (DMS) which play roles in global climate and carbon-sulfur biogeochemistry. Due to the difficulty in measuring trace gases in coastal ecosystems (e.g., flooding, salinity), our current understanding is based on snapshot instantaneous measurements (e.g., performed during daytime low tide) which complicates our ability to assess the role of these ecosystems for natural climate solutions. We performed continuous, automated measurements of soil trace gas fluxes throughout the growing season to obtain high-temporal frequency data and to provide insights into magnitudes and temporal variability across rapidly changing conditions such as tidal cycles. We found that soil CO2 fluxes did not show a consistent diel pattern, CH4, N2O, and CS2 fluxes were highly variable with frequent pulse emissions (> 2500 %, > 10 000 %, and > 4500 % change, respectively), and DMS fluxes only occurred midday with changes > 185 000 %. When we compared continuous measurements with discrete temporal measurements (during daytime, at low tide), discrete measurements of soil CO2 fluxes were comparable with those from continuous measurements but misrepresent the temporal variability and magnitudes of CH4, N2O, DMS, and CS2. Discrepancies between the continuous and discrete measurement data result in differences for calculating the sustained global warming potential (SGWP), mainly by an overestimation of CH4 fluxes when using discrete measurements. The high temporal variability of trace gas fluxes complicates the accurate calculation of budgets for use in blue carbon accounting and earth system models. Copyright Â© 2022 Margaret Capooci.

AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) injection into marine sediments is considered to be a supplementary method for enhancing methane (CH4) recovery from CH4-hydrate reservoirs. It is essential to consider the geomechanical characteristics of CO2-hydrate sediments to ensure sustainable CH4-hydrate production using CO2 injection. Experimental methods involving drained triaxial compression tests on artificial CO2-hydrate sand specimens were developed. The mechanical property of CO2-hydrate sand specimens was compared with that of CH4-hydrate sand specimens. The difference in the mechanical property of CO2-hydrate and CH4-hydrate sand specimens was thought to be due to crystal growth and/or cavity occupancy in load-bearing hydrate.

AB  - The latest engine technologies are bringing important benefits, in terms of reduced fuel consumption costs, reduced lubricating oil costs and reduced exhaust emissions, for the propulsion of today's and tomorrow's container ships. This paper reviews three of these technologies: the WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤ Pulse Lubricating System (PLS), high-efficiency waste heat recovery, and the new electronically-controlled WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤ RT-flex82C common-rail engines. The Pulse Cylinder Lubricating System, with electronically-timed, load-dependent control, allows major reductions in cylinder oil feed rates for considerable cost savings. High-efficiency waste heat recovery (WHR) systems in association with WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤ RT-flex common-rail engines allow up to 12% of main engine shaft power to be recovered as electrical power which can then be employed as additional ship propulsion power and for shipboard services. The new WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤ RT-flex82C engines ideally match the propulsion requirements of panamax container ships up to around 5000 TEU. Â©2006: Royal Institution of Naval Architects.

TI  - Bionic investigation of a dolphin head-based hydrofoil with emphasis on energy performance and flow characteristics
JO  - Ocean Engineering
PY  - 2023
VL  - 270
IS  - NA
AB  - Tidal energy, regarded as clean and renewable energy source, has received widespread attention from scholars. As the basic structure of tidal power generator, the energy performance and flow characteristics of hydrofoil have a significant impact on the power generation efficiency. In this paper, a new dolphin head-based bionic hydrofoil is proposed based on the special shape of the dolphin's head, then three structures of dolphin bionic hydrofoils are obtained through corresponding modifications. Based on the accuracy verification of the numerical method, the energy performance and flow characteristics of the bionic hydrofoils are investigated. The results reveal that compared with original dolphin hydrofoil (ODH), the lift coefficients of deflected dolphin hydrofoil (DDH) under different attack angles are increased by 35.51%, 22.75%, 19.44%, 20.80%, 25.98% and 32.86%, respectively. The pressure distribution and flow characteristics around bionic hydrofoils are analyzed, and the results indicate that the pressure on the hydrofoil surface affects the lift and drag coefficients. The vortex distribution of the hydrofoil proves that DDH has a more stable flow pattern. The lift and drag coefficients is increased with the rise of inlet velocity, which provides potential value for the selection of tidal energy equipment under different application scenarios. The enhancement of the energy performance and flow characteristics prove that bionic hydrofoil will be effective in promoting energy utilization of tidal power generation and hydro turbine.

AB  - Application of high efficiency energy storage techniques may stimulate in a near future a larger exploitation of renewable energy sources. Energy storage, in fact, not only can improve the quality of produced power, but also make possible the implementation of sophisticated energy management strategies, fully decoupling the power delivery from power generation. In such a scenario, Vanadium Redox Batteries Energy Storage Systems represent a quite mature technology. In fact, they are able to store large amounts of energy on medium and long periods with competitive costs. The purpose of this paper is to study the introduction of a VRB Energy Storage System in a standalone tidal turbine generator. The generator is tasked to supply a set of residential loads with minimal use of energy delivered from conventional generators burning fossil fuels. Optimization of the VRB storage system and stability analysis are performed by simulation in the time domain under different operating conditions.

TI  - Emissions assessment of a tanker in a chilean port using bi-directional cold ironing integrated to LNG
JO  - Sustainable Energy Technologies And Assessments
PY  - 2022
VL  - 52
IS  - NA
AB  - Air pollution in coastal cities and nearby communities has become a health problem in the last decades because of the dispersion of pollutants produced by the various port activities. In this context, when a vessel at berth uses its auxiliary engines to generate the electric power to maintain its service, the operational profile is not continuous; the auxiliary engines work outside their fuel efficiency range, producing additional pollutant emissions. To reduce emissions while in port and at berth, two short-term options are considered: the first option is using alternative energy sources such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) instead of current fuels. The second option is using cold ironing technology, which enables to turn-off the vessels auxiliary engines, by feeding the services using shore power supply. In a classical cold ironing configuration, energy only flows from shore to on board. This work presents an emissions assessment of a tanker vessel at berth, applying a novel bi-directional energy flow strategy associated to a cold ironing system, integrating LNG, and compared to current fuels used, focused on the environmental impact on Quintero's Bay. This bay is one of the most important port areas of the Chilean coast deemed to be affected by emissions generated by intense port activities. Taking current fuels such as heavy fuel oil (HFO) and marine diesel oil (MDO) and ship's arrivals/departures from port as a reference case, the results presented in this work, show a significant reduction in emissions when applying the bi-directional energy flow strategy.

AB  - Nonnative bigheaded carps are established in the Mississippi River and there is substantial concern about their potential entry into the interconnected Laurentian Great Lakes. While electrical barriers currently exist as a preventative measure, there is need for additional control mechanisms to promote barrier security through redundancy. We tested the effectiveness of infused carbon dioxide gas (CO2) as a tool to influence the movement and behavior invasive bigheaded carps, namely Bighead Carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and Silver Carp H. molitrix, as well as native Bigmouth Buffalo Ictiobus cyprinellus, Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus, Paddlefish Polyodon spathula, and Yellow Perch Perca flavescens in an experimental pond. Individuals were monitored with acoustic telemetry before, during, and after CO2 addition to the pond. We noted distinct changes in fish behavior following CO2 addition. Each species except Paddlefish maintained farther distances from the CO2 infusion manifold relative to controls. Both bigheaded carp species had slower persistence velocities (persistence of a movement in a given direction) following CO2 infusion and Bighead Carp used a smaller area of the pond immediately after CO2 addition. Pond pH progressively decreased up to 1.5 units following CO2 infusion. This work provides evidence that could inform future research to enhance existing control measures used to deter high-risk invasive fishes, such as bigheaded carps.

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - There is growing interest in developing offshore HVDC networks to connect both offshore wind power and provide interconnection between regions. There are a number of technology, topology and protection options available to developers each with varying levels of design complexity, capital cost and system redundancy. This paper highlights some of the available options and outlines a methodology for investigating the performance of a number of these through an investigation of their reliability against a lifetime of expected fault conditions, principally through a calculation of the expected level of curtailed energy associated with each network design. A number of case studies are investigated to provide a comparison between options including designs with and without HVDC circuit breakers and with varying levels of interconnection and system redundancy. The paper shows that there are potentially significant benefits in terms of reduction in curtailed energy through use of redundant paths for power transmission in the network design and that these can in certain cases outweigh the increased capital expenditure associated with their implementation. An investigation into the need case for HVDC circuit breakers is carried out through a comparison with an alternative sectionalised HVDC network topology and the impact on system reliability is found to be negligible in comparison to the cost of the breakers. Offshore network reliability is also found to be highly sensitive to input assumptions for failure and repair rates and the variability within the results was found to be large meaning it could be difficult to accurately predict the reliability of future offshore network implementations.

JO  - Transnav-international Journal On Marine Navigation And Safety Of Sea Transportation

VL  - 13

AB  - In order to reduce the CO2 emission from ships, International Maritime Organization executes the restriction of Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) which limits amount of CO2 when freight of one ton is carried at one mile. Although the realization of higher efficiency of main engine without reduction of engine output is the best solution, it might be impossible. To comply with the EEDI requirements, it is assumed that the ship's engine power becomes smaller than the existing ship by means of improving the ship propulsive efficiency. However, shiphandling in rough seas is expected to become difficult when the engine power is reduced. In this paper it is shown that the influence of the degraded main engine exerts on the safety of shiphandling in heavy weather based on the simulation study. In these experiments, both the simulation model that decreased engine power corresponding to EEDI requirement and that with the conventional engine power were tested, and masters in active service maneuvered the test ships in the rough seas.

VL  - NA

AB  - Two-stroke low speed diesels dominate the main propulsion engine market, being selected for nearly 80% of all ocean-going vessels. The main reason is the simplicity of the direct-coupled installation, the high reliability and the high thermal efficiencies. Four-stroke medium speed engines take the last 20 %, except on the LNG carrier propulsion field where steam turbines, while being threatened, still prevail. The occasional exception to the above is a few gas turbines in passenger (cruise) vessels. Recently, two-stroke low speed diesels have been developed for electronically controlled fuel injection systems, and such engines are now gaining momentum in the industry. The electronically (rather than cam) controlled fuel injection systems bring with it many operational benefits, which will be outlined in the paper. One such feature is the ability to inject very small fuel amounts safely through the same injectors as those able for full power operation. This paves the way for a more simple and safe version of large low speed dual fuel gas engines for propulsion of LNG carriers, representing significant fuel and gas saving possibilities, reducing CO2 emissions, and also opening new frontiers for low emission high-efficiency ship propulsion systems in other vessel types, including the largest types, as well as land based power generation. The paper will outline the technology, especially with a view to emission control and its economical and environmental potential.

AB  - This paper examines the dynamic causal relationships between carbon emissions, deadweight tonnage (DWT) of the total global shipping fleet, fuel oil consumption, and economic activities for marine transportation using cointegration, error-correction, and Granger causality techniques. The intensity of carbon emissions and energy consumption, in addition to the elasticity of emissions and DWT, is discussed. It is concluded that (1) there exist long-run relationships between these variables for the period of 1980 and 2006; (2) the higher levels of economic activities induce more DWT growth than the growth of CO2 emissions; and (3) the fuel oil consumption is a weak exogenous variable to produce theCO(2)emissions. This paper also found that the cost of mitigation is increasing, and thus carbon finance is likely to become more common in the future. These results also provide policy recommendations to combat climate change.

AB  - In recent years, the shipping industry has faced an increasing number of challenges in terms of fluctuating fuel prices, stricter environmental regulations, and concerns about global warming. In this situation, passenger volumes on cruise ships have increased from around 4 million to 13 million from 1990 to 2008 and keep growing today. A small cruise ship can emit about 85 tons of CO2 per day, and require around 27 tons of fuel per day. To keep up with market demand, while reducing their impact on the environment, cruise ships will need to improve their energy efficiency. Most previous research in marine technology relates to energy efficiency focused on propulsion, which for most ship types constitutes the largest energy demand. On cruise ships, however, auxiliary heat and electric power also have a significant importance. For this reason, we focus in this paper on the heat demand and its integration with available sources of waste heat on board. In this study, the principles of process integration are applied to the energy system of a cruise ship operating in the Baltic Sea. The heat sources (waste heat from the main and auxiliary engines in form of exhaust gas, cylinder cooling, charge air cooling, and lubricating oil cooling) and sinks (HVAC, hot water, fuel heating) are evaluated based on one year of operational data and used to generate four operating conditions that best represent ship operations. Applying the pinch analysis to the system revealed that the theoretical potential for heat integration on board could potentially allow the reduction of the external heat demand by between 35% and 85% depending on the investigated case. A technoeconomic optimisation allowed the identification of the most economically viable heat exchanger network designs: two in the â€œretrofitâ€ scenario and one in the â€œdesignâ€ scenario, with a reduction of 13-33%, 15-27% and 46-56% of the external heat demand, respectively. Given the high amount of heat being available after the process integration, we also analysed the potential for the installation of a steam turbine for the recovery of the energy available in the exhaust gas, which resulted in up to 900 kW of power being available for on board electric power demand.

AB  - Burgeoning dependence on fossil fuels for transport and industrial sectors has been posing challenges such as depletion of fossil fuel reserves, enhanced greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint, with the imminent changes in the climate, etc. This has necessitated an exploration of sustainable, eco-friendly and carbon neutral energy alternatives. Recent studies on biofuels indicate that algal biomass, particularly from marine macroalgae (seaweeds) have the potential to supplement oil fuel. Marine macroalgae are fast growing and carbohydrate rich biomass having advantage over other biofuel feedstock in terms of land dependence, freshwater requirements, not competing with food crops, which were the inherent drawback of the first- and second-generation feedstock. The present communication reviews the macroalgal feedstock availability, screening and selection of viable feedstock based on the biochemical composition, process involved, scope and opportunities in bioethanol production as well as technology interventions. The prospect of bioethanol production from algal feedstock of Central West Coast of India has been evaluated taking into account challenges (feedstock sustenance, technical feasibility, economic viability) in order to achieve energy sustainability. The green algae exhibited growth during all seasons and highest total carbohydrate was recorded from green seaweed Ulva lactuca (62.15 +/- 12.8\%). Elemental (CHN) analyses of seaweed samples indicate 25.31-37.95\% of carbon, 4.52-6.48\% hydrogen and 1.88-4.36\% Nitrogen. Highest carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen content were recorded respectively from G.pusillum (C: 37.95\%), G. pusillum (H: 6.48\%) and E.intestinalis (N: 4.36\%). Green seaweeds are rich in cellulose content (>10\%) compared to other seaweeds (2-10\%). Higher cellulose content was estimated in U.lactuca (14.03 +/- 0.14\%), followed by E. intestinalis (12.10 +/- 0.53\%) and C.media (10.53 +/- 0.17\%). Cellulose is a glucan present in green seaweeds, which can easily be hydrolysed through enzyme and subsequently fermented to produce bioethanol. Lower sugar removal in acid hydrolysate neutralization process (Na2CO3) was recorded in U.lactuca (39.8\%) and E.intestinalis (14.7\%). Highest ethanol yield of 1.63 g and 0.49 g achieving 25.8\% and 77.4\% efficiency in SHF (Separate Hydrolysis and Fermentation) and SSF (Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation) process respectively was recorded for green alga E. intestinalis.

AB  - Large-scale wind farms will play an important role in the future worldwide energy supply. However, with increasing wind power penetration all stakeholders on the electricity market will ask for more skilful wind power predictions regarding save grid integration and to increase the economic value of wind power. A Neural Network is used to calculate Model Output Statistics (MOS) for each individual forecast model (ECMWF and HIRLAM) and to model the aggregated power curve of the Middelgrunden offshore wind farm. We showed that the combination of two NWP models clearly outperforms the better single model. The normalized day-ahead RMSE forecast error for Middelgrunden can be reduced by 1 % compared to single ECMWF. This is a relative improvement of 6 %. For lead times >24h it is worthwhile to use a more sophisticated model combination approach than simple linear weighting. The investigated principle component regression is able to extract the uncorrelated information from two NWP forecasts. The spread of Ensemble Predictions is related to the skill of wind power forecasts. Simple contingency diagrams show that low spread corresponds is more often related to low forecast errors and high spread to large forecast errors. Â© 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Blue carbon - the carbon stored and sequestered in mangrove forests, seagrass meadows, and tidal salt marshes is considered a cost-effective means to achieve positive climate change mitigation and adaptation outcomes. Blue carbon is therefore of considerable interest to the scientific and policy communities, and is frequently discussed in relation to carbon markets and climate finance opportunities. This paper identifies peer-reviewed and `gray literature' documents that discuss blue carbon in the context of finance and market mechanisms. The document set is analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively, and the principal scientific, economic, regulatory, social, and management issues that emerge are discussed. The study reveals that (1) the blue carbon literature is dominated by technical and policy commentary, with a dearth of research into practical social considerations and a stark absence of private sector perspectives; (2) there is confusion over the nature and role of important concepts including private and public sector finance and instruments; and (3) understanding of the important issues of investment priorities and risk considerations is also limited. This paper therefore identifies gaps in the blue carbon literature, clarifies critical concepts and issues, and proposes novel pathways for blue carbon research and project development (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Methanol-fueled ships have already been built to equivalent technology standards so the flag state and classification community understands it is safe and practical. Research undertaken for the Methanol Institute suggests it can be bunkered at more than 100 ports globally and is either available on site or within close proximity to berths, with very little modification required to the existing bunkering infrastructure. The Methanol Institute is currently engaged in a pilot project in Singapore converting a crew transport service vessel which will also bunker Methanol regularly. Among the elements being studied is the availability of both conventional and renewable/bio methanol to move further towards a low/net carbon neutral environment, faster and in an economically viable manner. Based on over 60,000 hr of dual fuel engine testing conducted over three years by MAN Energy Solutions, a two-stroke engine running on methanol can reduce CO2 emissions by 15% compared with Tier II engines on HFO. Maritime start-up FUELSAVE has attracted more ship owners to its FS MARINE+ process for dynamic and load-based injection of hydrogen, oxygen, methanol, and water into marine engine fuel delivery systems. This resulted in the cleaner and more thorough combustion of fuel, typically HFO, is a dilution of the effects of a dirty primary fuel with a clean-burning alcohol distillate. FS MARINE+ is an efficiency enhancement and emissions reduction solution that achieves real net cost savings while reducing a vesselâ€™s carbon footprint and air pollution.

TI  - Mean kinetic energy replenishment mechanisms in vertical-axis wind turbine farms

AB  - Vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) are the subject of renewed interest due to the potential for higher power generation per unit land used, as well as their lower center of mass (the generator is at the bottom of tower), which renders them favorable for offshore deployment. However, VAWT farms have hardly been studied. In this paper, using a previously tested actuator line model in a large eddy simulation code, we investigate the transport of the mean kinetic energy (MKE) that replenishes the power in the farm. The primary sources of MKE are (1) the initial advective streamwise influx through the frontal area and (2) the vertical planform influx through the top and bottom interfaces of the farm. The results show that, for realistic finite-size farms, the planform MKE transport is a loss term over the first six rows: in this initial zone the mean flow adjusts by slowing down, and an upward mean advection develops that results in an efflux loss of MKE from the farm volume. The power extracted from farms is thus mainly from the frontal advection over the first few rows. When the initial streamwise advective flux is exhausted, the planform regeneration of MKE from above the wind farm becomes the dominant source; it is primarily affected by turbulent-mean interaction. This regeneration continues to adjust until rows 8 to 10 in our setups, beyond which a fully developed flow (similar to an infinite wind farm) can be observed. In the fully developed region, actual mechanical power generation by the turbines is about one third of replenishment. A primary conclusion is that more irregular farms designs should be studied, while the current literature continues to focus on the very classic layouts. Â© 2018 American Physical Society.

AB  - The use of experimental investigation techniques in the research of internal combustion engines has contributed substantially to their progress and development over time. The performances obtained in the development of modern engines have been strongly influenced by the emergence and development of the investigation equipment, especially the laser and the modern computing technique. Maritime transport generates about 4% of the total CO2 emissions produced by human activities, which means that its carbon value is almost as large as that of Germany. Emissions from this sector are not yet internationally regulated, but this issue is currently being debated within the IMO and the United Nations Framework Convention on climate change (UNFCCC). Of the strategies to reduce pollutant emissions from ships, identified so far, the technical solutions are the first ones that have been implemented on board. The advantage of using technical solutions onboard ships is the high efficiency of reducing a product or several pollutant products, but the main disadvantage is the high cost of implementing and operating them on board ships.

TI  - Wind energy potential assessment in the Persian Gulf: A spatial and temporal analysis

AB  - Despite the high capacity of wind energy in the offshore regions of Iran seas, wind power plants in these parts have not been significantly considered. In this study, the temporal and spatial wind characteristics and wind energy potential of the Persian Gulf are investigated during the years 2000â€“2017 based on the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 reanalysis data set. The spatio-temporal distributions of the annual, seasonal, monthly, and diurnal mean wind characteristics are presented using the 18-year hourly resolution results. Statistical analysis and variability indices of the wind parameters are presented. The Weibull density function is used to assess and analyze the wind characteristics of the region. The Weibull shape k and scale c parameters are calculated using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method. Finally, the wind capacities at the 12 potential locations near the populated or industrial regions around the studied area are derived. Besides, the capacity factor and the potential energy output of two commercial wind turbines are investigated, which are appropriate for the locations at 50 m and 80 m hub heights. The present results can be used to develop of wind energy plans and wind energy potential assessment in the studied area. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - World records for tidal and offshore wind power are expected to be broken in the UK, as two major energy projects made big advances during February 2015. A 2,400 MW North Sea wind farm secured government approval, while generating equipment suppliers have been selected for a 320 MW tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay. The government has approved the Dogger Bank Creyke Beck A and B wind farm development off the coast of Yorkshire from February 17, 2015. The farm will include 400 turbines, and be the world's largest of its type. The project said to be the country's largest renewable project to secure planning consent, is divided into two separate 1,200 MW turbine arrays.

TI  - A novel methodology for effective short-circuit calculation in offshore wind power plants considering converter limitations
JO  - Electric Power Systems Research
PY  - 2022
VL  - 211
IS  - NA
AB  - This paper deals with the short-circuit calculation of offshore wind power plants (OWPPs). The short-circuit calculation presented in this paper assumes the studied system achieves a new equilibrium state during the fault. The studied system is modeled with an element-based steady-state formulation where the grid-support control and potential current-saturated operation of wind turbine (WT) converters are included. In particular, the current-saturation modifies the converter control and represents various potential operation states of the converter. Then, an iterative methodology is proposed to identify the short-circuit equilibrium point that satisfies convertersâ€™ limitations and to obtain the current-saturation states of all power converters with a specific fault scenario in the studied system. The numerical case studies indicate that the WT converters operation has a significant influence to the system equilibrium point during the fault. In addition, the presented methodology is efficient for short-circuit calculation of a large-scale OWPP. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Renewable energy from the high seas: Geo-spatial modelling of resource potential and legal implications for developing offshore wind projects beyond the national jurisdiction of coastal States
JO  - Energy Policy
PY  - 2019
VL  - 128
IS  - NA
AB  - Offshore wind energy projects are currently restricted to the exclusive economic zones of coastal States. Recent advances in technology are raising the prospect of utilising excellent wind resources on the high seas. Using a global geo-spatial model we identify potential resource areas for this. In the shallow water case for bottom fixed foundations the largest locations are found on the Mascarene Plateau in the Indian Ocean and the Grand Banks in the North Atlantic. The deep water case for floating platforms identifies the largest regions on the Grand Banks/Flemish Cap and Rockall Bank/Hatton Ridge, both in the North Atlantic. The overall legal framework for wind energy projects on the high seas is the United Nations Convention in the Law of the Sea. Flag states will play a central regulatory role for high seas wind energy developments. There is the danger that flags of convenience might evolve and unduly undercut environmental and safety standards that are in place for projects on the territorial sea and EEZ. Such abuse of high seas freedom could compromise the UNCLOS principle of â€˜due regardâ€™. Marine spatial planning approaches and the establishment of cooperative mechanisms, led by the IMO, could safeguard against such potential misappropriation. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd
